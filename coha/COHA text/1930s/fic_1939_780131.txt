 | the Atlantic thundered against the eastern cliffs , she lay in the heather and read books while he fished the peaty burns . He loved the Shetland lochs . Lonely and forlorn . He loved the secret silence of their gray lichened rocks . Alone in this bleak moorland , he loved the companionship of Christina as he sat there , tying on flies , or admiring perhaps a fine sea trout he had just landed . And their lunches when the lochs lay blue and they sprawled smoking in the sun . It was a good life . " One of these days , " he told Christina , " we will buy a pub . We 'll call it The Rainbow Trout . ' Where shall we have it ? " " Casablanca . " " No . I 've seen the place ; it 's an African Brighton . Do n't let names get you . Where ? . . .

Those fluffy things . You want them firm , with the creases showing , cooked in butter . . . . " " I would n't have a pub . You 'd never be in it . You would always be racing up to London . " " Do n't you believe it ; the one thing I like is the country ? and you know it . Why do n't we have a cottage ?

Why the  | devil did n't they have this at once  --  at once ! Because this was dangerous . He had purposely told Kyra not to write to him while he was in the Shetlands . He had made the excuse that he was roaming the islands , and that up on the island of Yell or Unst , where he would probably go , mail only got there by motorboat . Never knew when it would come . There was nothing to say , anyway , he said when she persisted . He knew that the truth was he did not want one thing from the outside to enter into this holiday with Chris . " You 're selfish , Peter , " said Chris . " Me ! " " Yes , you are . You 're splendid about money and material things . You 're unique . But you 're selfish about yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little things , like tiny presents , they do mean so much to a woman . It would make no difference if they did n't cost a shilling . " " Oh , damn it all . . . . " " Absolutely . In Vienna , when you gave me the money to buy my belt instead of going around to select it with me . . . And you never remember my birthday  --  or even our wedding day  --  when was it ? " Lynd tried to think . " June loth ! " he said proudly . " Yes , it was . Those were wonderful days . " " Were n't they . And we 've got just as many more ahead of us . Now listen , Chris . . . . " As he argued with her , and looked at that nice creature , those noble eyes of hers , he wondered what on earth it was - that made this lack of the physical satisfaction poison all the rest of their life . For Chris was quite right ; he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to do the little things . Often , he merely felt sorry for her . He would protect her on the big things . But that was not love . . . . One evening as they trudged home across the wine-red moors a boy came towards them . There are no trees in the  | Shetlands , and you can see a sheep for miles . The boy was running . He was waving a telegram . It read : PLEASE RUSH BERLIN They spent that winter in Germany . I I Berlin was in a state of jitters that winter over a threatened Nazi putsch . The world was being thrown into a like state of apprehension by a sensational press which had never had such a godsend for headlines as Herr Hitler . Lynd went the usual rounds of establishing his contacts for information . The Wilhelmstrasse , the American Embassy , the bar of the Adlon Hotel . The last was the most useful . Several of the most prominent foreign correspondents gathered there every day before lunch to have a goblet or so of cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's brains . Two Jewish correspondents , with apprehensive ears to the ground , were particularly brilliant in their analyses of the inevitability of Hitler  --  with them , the fear being father to the thought . To see the little Charlie Chaplinesque figure who was giving Europe such nightmares , Tony went down to the first Leipsic trial where three young Reichswehr officers were on trial , possibly for their lives , on the charge of having succumbed to Nazi propaganda . Hitler was giving testimony in their defense . " I never tried to corrupt the Reichswehr ! " thundered Hitler . " I want the Reichswehr to be faithful so that I can use it when I get into office ! " Tony sat within a few feet of the inconspicuous little figure in the shiny double-breasted blue suit when the future ruler of Germany was jabbing his finger at the seven scarlet-robed judges of the Supreme Court . The judges automatically jerked backwards as Hitler stabbed his finger at them . Hitler 's voice rose and roared until its reverberance was like that of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the mullioned windows of the Supreme Court , Tony heard the shouting in the streets . The taut faces of the three young Reichswehr officers in the dock were gray as putty . " And when I get into power ! " roared Hitler ; " then , I tell you  --  heads will roll in the sand ! " When Tony returned to Berlin he expected a wire of congratulation from his paper . He had been the only American correspondent present when Hitler made that speech that rocked the world . But he did not get it . To one of the Jew correspondents at the Adlon , he said : " You win . In my dispatch I put that heads will roll in the sands ' stuff where Hitler made it  --  after he had spoken for some twenty minutes declaring he was not going to putsch , he did n't need to . You , very sensibly , led off with it . " " Of course ! " grinned the Jew ? " that 's good journalism . What do you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Your cable reads better than mine anyway . . . mine was dull . Have you ever met Dr. Frank ? No ? Well , I sat up most of the night before the trial with him . . . very interesting . . . . He explained how he was one of the original seven Nazis , only a few years ago : In these next elections , ' he said , we ought to poll around four or five millions . We are inevitable ! ' " The Jew nodded solemnly . " Sure  --  you 're right there . That 's the real story . But hell . . . . You know what the papers want . I tried to get my crowd to print a story that Hitler is being backed by Fritz Thyssen and the big Rhine industrialists . . . and you know what they cabled : that I was seeing things ! " Lynd thought he was seeing things when he attended his first session of the German Reichstag  --  and found it a madhouse . When he saw the brown-shirted Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn assemblage , and a vociferous crowd of Socialists charge from the other . . . when he saw these two bodies of delegates making faces and shaking their fists at each other directly below the President 's  | chair  --  while the President clanged a cowbell up and down over their heads to quieten them  --  Lynd said to a brother correspondent : " Why , it 's like waking up in a loony bin ! " " When you 've been in this country long as I have , " muttered the other , " you 'll think a loony bin is the only sane place . " Christina , in the afternoons , went to the various cocktail parties given by the correspondents themselves or the diplomatic corps , and she sat by his side at the official luncheons given by the Foreign Office . She spoke excellent German , and as they stayed on they went out more and more into German life and entertained in their own apartment off the Tiergarten . They saw Reinhardt 's " Midsummer Night 's Dream , " " The White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its vast theatre with the revolving stage . Lynd saw another side of Berlin night life . Visiting correspondents from other European capitals or America did not want to waste their evenings on the conventional shows : " Let 's see some life ! " was their chronic request . For Berlin was very decadent in those depression days . In some shows the female performers bought no costumes whatever . Or perhaps a red rose to cover some of the little necessities of life . One hardened globe-trotter turned up and irritatingly dared Lynd to show him something new . Lynd took him to a dim little place with shaded lights and people talking quietly at the tables , where a man played dreamily on the piano . If he knew you , or thought you would buy him a bottle of champagne , he would improvise a song about you and sing it as you drank your wine . " Tame ! " said the disgusted American . " Well , he is off form , " said Tony , who had been thinking he had talked too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He called the headwaiter and asked : " What 's the matter with him ? "  | " He jumped in the Spree and tried to drown himself , " said the waiter . " Yes , I knew he was in trouble  --  his wife left him ? " " No  --  she came back . " " Bah ! " snorted the questing New Yorker . " Old stuff . " 4 They strolled along under the neon lights and Lynd turned into " Eldorado . " " I 'm afraid there 's not much doing , " he said , as they checked their hats . " You can dance if you want to ? there 's a beauty ! " The globe-trotter looked . It was a lovely girl , her blonde hair shingled in an Eton crop ; when Tony nodded she smirked and came over to their table . " Dance ? " said the world-traveler . The girl smiled . " Gosh ! " said the globe-trotter when he sat down . " She 's a forward minx . Know what she did to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , girls ' toilet I guess , and ? " " You did n't think that was a girl , did you ? " asked Tony . The man stopped . His eyes stared . He was obviously trying to remember what he had just done  --  or had done to him . " My  --  God ! " he said . " Honest ? " " Exactly , " said Tony . At Christmas Lynd got an unlucky second-man on one of the American Agencies to sub for him and he and Christina went down to Garmisch for the winter sports . Lynd 's bad leg prevented him from skiing , for which he was thankful . And Christina had never learned the sport . But she had only to see a mountain before the next thing was the demand that they should both climb it . She nearly killed him , trying to see how far they could get , in that snow , up the sides of the chill Zugspitz . They were snobbish enough to be furious when they found the Americans and British had also discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under this beloved and  | much-advertised German mountain ; and so , after a few days of freezing walks and suffocating cocktails in the inns of Garmisch , they came back . Before leaving Berlin Lynd had spent a small fortune on telephoning Kyra at nights . They had managed to have a last night together before he left London , not going to their shabby room off Russell Square , but driving down to Maidenhead where Kyra , at any rate , ate a surprisingly big dinner and they went to sleep with the pleasant sound of the water running over the weir . Kyra was gloomy , and it was with great fondness that he looked at her head lying on his arm and tried to get her to talk about things . Kyra did not want to talk . She merely wanted to feel his arms around her as she fell asleep . She had asked him if she could keep the Russell Square room ; it was frightfully difficult living nose-to-nose with her parents , she said . He could well understand that ; and knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as he lay awake and looked at her babyish face that night ; he was getting all the fun out of this  --  and he was not suffering anything . By rights , if he was going to go on with Kyra , he should get a divorce from Chris and marry her . But , he told himself coldly , he was human . It was a rotten thing to do , perhaps  --  to sleep with Kyra when he would not go the whole length of marrying her . But he knew he would not . He would rather be a swine than ruin Christina 's life . That was all there was to it . And Kyra did not seem to want that . Colonel Bumby , he could not get Kyra to speak of . Nor of this dangling divorce from her peculiar husband . So he did not know what was the position . He could not afford it , but he sent Kyra before Christmas enough money to take the Powers all away over the holidays , and begged her to take her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough to drive anyone  | crazy , and even Mrs. Power might take a more reasonable view of life if given some fresh air . Kyra wrote him a brief note . The Powers , quite characteristically , had gone to the most expensive hotel in Torquay  --  and spent it all in two days . But perhaps they were right to have two days , such as they had once lived , where money meant nothing , even if it had to be Torquay . Kyra was still a bad letter writer , more ineffective even than when face to face . She was irritatingly coy as if she were afraid to put down " love " in the written word . Her little messages were full of trivialities , not even good gossip , or even questions . It was just as if a child had been given a punishment to write a hundred words . But he loved them for the gay little spirit they showed  --  and her courage . Then they suddenly stopped coming . When three weeks had gone he tried to telephone her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to afford such a thing , and he had been accustomed to asking for Kyra via the woman next door . When he tried to press this woman as to why he could never get Mrs. Fayne ( it was the only occasion on which he had to use Kyra 's married name ) or had she been given his message , the vulgar voice at the other end at last said : " I do not interfere in other people 's business . . . . " Her words and tone , for it was obvious that she gloated in being able to say something to upset him , alarmed Tony so much that he decided to fly to London . He wired Kyra to meet him , and got on next day 's Cologne ' plane . As the green of England came below him he looked down with a feeling of dread . There had been something wrong in all this , this leaving Kyra alone to face life . He pictured her in London 's eight millions ; brave , pert-nosed , trying not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have seen her as he peered down at Croydon enclosure while they were circling to land . She was not there . He missed the Airways Bus back to London while he was telephoning , to see if there was  | any message at his club . Then he hired a taxi and drove straight to Hammersmith . Roderick gave a start when he answered the bell , and seemed on the point of preventing him from coming in . Then he said , " Hello , old chap , " and motioned Lynd down the corridor . Mrs. Power was crouched , more like an angry marmoset than ever , in her corner chair . " Where 's Kyra ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " said Mrs. Power . " Do n't know ? What do you mean ? " " Kyra is not living here any more . " Lynd sighed with relief . " Well , will you tell me where I can get her ? " Kyra 's father and mother looked at each other and then finally Roderick gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , that 's all right ; I 'll just go around and find her . Or maybe we could telephone from here ? " The Powers looked at each other ; then Roderick , with a sigh , wrote out a telephone number . Tony walked out into the street to the corner call-box and dialed the number . There was no reply . " I do n't think you will get her . Kyra said that she was going out tonight . " Mrs. Power said that , the instant he came back . And Lynd saw that she was glad to say it spitefully . He asked Roderick would he like to come out for a drink . Roderick looked out from under his swollen lids at Mrs. Power . And then bravely said he would . " What is all this ? " asked Lynd nervously when they sat before the pub fire . Roderick 's answer was more frightening than ever . " Do n't ask me , " he said , wearily . " Women . I do n't know what to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | It seemed unfair to try and pry out things about Kyra behind her back ; so Tony poured a couple more double whiskies into the bloated Roderick , and dropped him as he taxied back to his club . At his club he put in another call . No answer . Then , braving the sophisticated porter 's concern ( that servant was too used to this kind of thing ) he told him to call that number at regular half-hour intervals . " I can get a room here in the club if I want it , ca n't I ? " asked Lynd . " Yessir  --  there 's two vacant and I 'll let you know if any other gentlemen asks for them , sir . " He went up , sat on the fender by the fire . He no longer felt dispassionate and merely friendly toward Kyra . He felt furious , frightened , and desired her madly . He finally had to take one of the club rooms . In the morning the telephone rang beside his bed . " Here 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice and Lynd knew without even looking at his watch , it must be very early . " Hello , hello , hello . . . " He heard Kyra 's bell-like tones , obviously anxious to find out who was calling her . " Hello there , " he said . There was a silence before she answered , and then she said : " Hello . " " Look here , " said Lynd , trying to make his voice sound light and cheerful , " did n't you get my wire ? " " I  --  I , of course , yes  --  but I could n't meet you . I . . . I was out of town . " It was a bad lie , and it shook him to realize it . " Well , why did n't you leave a note for me at the club ? When can I see you ? " " Well , why . . . could n't we have dinner at Zappi 's tonight ? Say eight ? I shall be busy up to then . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid not , Fofoiser . " " Oh . . . all right . "  | When Lynd got to Zappi 's , at seven-thirty , he found Kyra already there . She was laughing with the grouped Italian family ; and the first thing she did was seize the young Zappi girl and turn her round and round before Lynd . " Look ! Fofoiser , I made that myself  --  is n't it smart ! " Lynd growled something about Carissima 's dress and asked Zappi for a table . Kyra was as hard to pin down that night as butterflies . Her mind would not rest on any subject . Finally Lynd said , " Let 's go back to your flat . " " But I 've got a girl living with me ! " " Does n't make any difference . I 'm not going to eat you . " There was a girl there . " Charmed to meet you , I 'm sure , " she said , mincing forward to touch Lynd 's hand . She was false . She was something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible in this place . " Do you mind ? " Lynd said , looking pointedly at the door , " I want to speak to Miss Power for a few minutes  --  alone . " The girl looked at Kyra , flung up her head and made as if to stay : " Well , me and Miss Power ? " she began . " Please ! " Lynd , just touching her arm , nodded towards the door . " How dare you ! " said Kyra , who had backed strangely into a corner . " How dare you treat one of my best friends like that ! " " That ! . . . " said Lynd . " Why , she 's as common as dirt . That girl 's the vulgarist little bitch I 've ever seen . Your friend ? " He frowned . " Kyra  --  what is it ? " he asked . " I wo n't be treated like a tart ! " His eyes opened . Now he knew the meaning of this sinister atmosphere in the flat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Kyra hit him . s s s For a moment he was dizzy with surprise and rage . He stood there , holding his face ; and then Kyra , who had retreated back into the corner of the room , began to take off her skirt . " I 've  | got to go out , " she said fiercely . She looked trapped , flustered to the point of frenzy . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " If you had been a tart , Kyra , it would n't make any difference . I love you . But you 're too damned stupid to be a tart . What the hell is all this ? If you 're tired of me , say so  --  I guess I can stand it . But I do n't think t hat 's it ? " It seemed hardly possible that anyone could escape some answer to that , but all Kyra panted was : " Violet is my friend ! " " Vi-olet ! Oh , Kyra . . . for Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must say ! " said Kyra . " You can use better language . " He put up his hand . " Stop it . I 'm going , I 'm not going to ask you any questions . Your life is your own  --  but just let me tell you one thing , Kyra , for all your guts  --  you are the damnedest little fool I have ever known . If you 've become so desperate that you have to take up with a girl like that , then it 's a ghastly shame . If that 's what you 've come to ! But what is all this mystery ? . . . This flat ? And why in hell 's name are you wearing black silk underwear ! " Kyra snatched up a black evening gown she had laid out on the bed and held it defensively before her breasts . " Get out ! " she said frantically . " Leave me alone ! " " All right . If you say so . " He picked up his hat and walked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long gray Lagonda turned up the cul-de-sac that now held Kyra 's ground-floor flat , and stopped before her door . It was not the kind of car you would expect in that kind of street . Lynd watched as a gray-haired man in a dinner jacket got out and playfully tapped on Kyra 's window with his stick before skipping into the apartment house . It looked like Colonel Bumby , or whatever his name was .  | The Berlin man returned to his post , and Lynd and Christina returned to London and opened their house in Cheyne Walk . One of the first things he did was buy Chris a dachshund puppy . They had watched a German , with three of them on a leash  --  all four of them staring into a window along Unter den Linden one day . They decided they must have one . The puppy  --  as Tony had happened to remember this birthday ? was a secret present . Chris awoke to find it on her bed . Over their coffee that morning they had a tantalizing argument as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slips . Zeppelin was the winner . The funny little thing did not look that way now ; but it would . She was a bitch in more senses of the word than one . Forgetful one day , Chris locked Zeppelin up in the closet with her best dresses . Zeppelin jumped up , dug her sharp teeth into the finest tissue and silks , and hung there until it ripped . When , hunting her distractedly all over the house , she was revealed by her happy barks at their footsteps , tragedy was also disclosed . From as far up as Zeppelin could jump Christina 's dresses looked like shredded wheat . Zeppelin had evidently tired of that some time back , and came out with an evening slipper in her mouth . Lynd made up for all the birthdays he had forgotten in years that day when , after a lunch at the Ivy , he went with Chris to a new dressmaker she wanted to try in Conduit Street . It did not make the hour he spent there with Christina any better to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made no attempt whatever to get into touch with Kyra . The days drifted along . He found London very dull . Most correspondents worked feverishly because they were afraid someone else would scoop them on a story ; they were often bored with it themselves . The mere round of his work brought a certain amount of occasions and functions . He got free  | tickets for first nights , to which he always took Chris . Christina could say immediately why she did or did not like a play ; he could not say why  --  he just did or did not like them , that was all . Usually he did not . Chris was a theatre fan and often went to a pit with some friend . On such evenings he went to his club , was frightened out of it by the spectacle of the same womanless men trying to find something to talk about over their wine in the dining-room . And he went to every party he was invited to . These were many . This was a bad sign for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of making conversation . He no longer hoped for anything exciting from them . He always cursed himself afterwards for having gone . And , after you have been to a few official functions , you know that they are the most meaningless displays of bare bosoms and decorations and indifferent food . He often longed for zabione at little Zappi 's with Kyra . Those meals had been heaven . Chris and he did a certain amount of entertaining at Cheyne Walk , either killing-off parties , or dinners at which six would be the most people and they could invite whom they liked . Chris was a witty conversationalist ; they had friends among many of the younger set in the foreign diplomatic corps , one very amusing Bolshie , and there was a more or less continual appearance of some man he had known in the Near or Far East , or from the States . As far as such things went , he could not have asked for a better life . Chris and he always sat after everyone had gone , and he enjoyed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to make him cut down these days . His insides were giving trouble , and one doctor , that he went to , even advised him to go to a psychiatrist . " Actually , it 's a case of nervous indigestion , " he said . " But you seem more mentally run down than anything else . Have you something that 's worrying you ? " Lynd smiled . " Nothing , I 'm afraid , that you 'd call serious . " " Well , you never know , " said the doctor .  | " I 'm just bored . That 's all . Bloody bored . " " Quite enough , " said the other . " Have you ever tried living in your mind ? Excuse me if I say this , but you seem a lusty chap  --  you know , the kind of man who likes the good things of life ; women , wine , and all that . . . . You feel you ca n't get along without them ? But being bored is not a thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign newspaper correspondent ! " " A great surgeon ! " said Lynd . The doctor laughed . " But you see I am not bored  --  I enjoy every day of my life . My work is enough to let me lose myself in it . " " Wish to God I could say that ! Let me try to explain something , " continued Tony , conscious that he was talking more for his own information than the doctor 's . " In my profession we are supposed to see a lot of the world , a lot of exciting things . We do . We see so damn many that we get bored with sensations . We lose our capacity to remain interested . The more stupid among us go blase at once  --  a year or so in Europe , and they think they know everything . You were asking me a minute ago did I ever try to live in my mind  --  did I think , in other words ? . . . Why , of course I do . I have to . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself familiar with it , every day . . . . " Tony laughed ; it seemed an impossible task , to dissect the reason for this lack of interest in his work . " Perhaps it 's a certain sense of the futility of it all , " he said . " You see , we all think at first that what we write is going to be read , and that it will mean something . Well . . . after a time you see the joke of all that . This town 's full of Diplomatic Correspondents , and journalistic intellectuals , sentimental liberals , most of them , who think that European governments tremble at their words . You see , the point is , we all think of a newspaper as some great entity , as if it were omniscient  --  well , when you know some of the woolly minds which write the editorials in London , warning Germany to be good  --  or the Soviets  | ? and you know some of the hard-boiled practical men who are running those countries . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Press . ' . . . " " Do you deny it ? " asked the doctor . " Not a bit . That 's the hell of it . I just know its shams vis-a-vis the Boob Public . That 's why I 've learned now not to take my job too seriously . I 'm interested in people  --  not politicians . The Press only want politics  --  what these canting humbugs have to say . Politicians , apparently , have special brains . They make the headlines . But the more I see of the people who are running things , the more I get the horrid feeling that this little world of ours is going plump to hell . " This is very long-winded , " said Tony , " but in talking to you like this do n't think I 'm running down my own colleagues . Far from it . It 's these other people I 'm talking about ; I wish you could know the dismay we feel at the things we have to listen to from certain of these big people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their blab lying  --  their unforgivable stupidity ; the fake secrets they think they are making you believe in , just because they whisper them to you under the rose .

You would understand then why , when some of us sit down to our typewriters , the first words that come into our minds after beginning PRIME MINISTER X SAID TODAY ' . . . are God help the world ! ' " Tony laughed and stood up . " And so , " he said , " I think we all spend too much time thinking and talking about politics . Perhaps we have to  --  but let the politicians do it . They made this mess . What I 'm thinking of , the more I see of this world , the more I want a little life of my own . Something very small ? a personal life  --  where a new set of habits might do me a lot of good ! " The doctor smiled . " You are absolutely right , " he said hopefully . " You must change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony reflected . " I 'm not sure I want to . I 'm not sure , if a man finds his life too dull , if he is n't entitled to a lot of bad habits to make up for it . Why not ? If they give  | him happiness . I know what you 're going to say ; that they will ruin his health . But health is n't everything , you know . Some of the most unpleasant people I know are vegetarians . . . simply odiously healthy people . No , I think I 'll go on the way I am . " While he had been reading obsolete Punch 's in the specialist 's waiting room , Tony had reflected that his visit was useless . No doctor had an answer for what was ailing him . There was no medicine in the whole pharmacopoeia that could pass as a remedy for the missing Kyra . The solution must be found in the course of events . Life had always been that way for him . A crisis nearly always meant that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . The future , therefore , always promised to be interesting . Lester Blackwood was an author who had become obsolete . In his younger days he had written some excellent belles-lettres . Days when people still quoted Walter Pater and writers did not need to have anything to say , as long as they said it beautifully . This was when he was in his mystical period . He had been , at that time , very religious , and there had been a tremendous vogue for his musings . But then people began to suspect that it was not their fault for being bewildered by Lester 's profound regurgitations about the road to fulfillment through spiritual suffering . Lester was merely out-Lestering himself . He might as well have been talking to a dog . Then his public turned on him . When he frantically wrote an obscene novel , to keep pace with the " ' Twenties , " and become popular again  --  people thought he had betrayed them . Lester Blackwood rapidly became a back number .

Hopeful young girls who were be-  | ginning to learn how to write . In other words , mediocrities . Most of his old friends kept away from Lester Blackwood 's parties . But when Lester called him up and said that he must come , Lynd needed no urging . Not in this desperate mood . But even as he drove out in his little open Lea-Francis to Bloomsbury he felt depressingly listless . Perhaps , he told himself , it was the oncoming spring . The party was even worse than he had expected . When he came in , a gathering of people , not one of whom he remembered ever seeing before , were sitting in a large circle around the board floor on white chamber pots . " Got the idea of the jerries from the Prater , in Vienna , " said Lester . " Haaaaaa ! Think it 's a good idea , do n't you ? Haaaa ! " Lynd shuddered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lester pulled at his gray goatee , gave another one of his wheeze-laughs , and offered Lynd a glass of slivowitz , the Slav 's plum brandy . When Lynd went into the next room to put away his coat , he found Patrick Byron lying on the bed , completely out , with his arm tight around the waist of a light-colored Negro girl . She grinned at Lynd , and mocking her own darky accent , said : " Dis yere baby o ' mine has suah got some grip foah a woman  --  even when he 's un-conscious . But , man ! what dat boy can do when he 's performin ' . . . Baby ! " " Want any help , " smiled Lynd . " I can unhitch him for you . " " No , man , you run along . I doan like those things out there that they 're sittin ' on . I had one of ' em break under me once ! " As Lynd returned , a young woman stepped in . She was slender , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room to Lynd . Her hair was reddish , dull in luster , done in a French bang like  --  like that central figure in  | the painting of the Cafe Royal . Her lips were striking scarlet , and slightly twisted . She had freckles . At first , Lynd thought her distinctly ugly and unappetizing . " You two already know each other , " leered Lester , ushering her across the room with his hand on her behind , a thing the young lady did not seem to mind . The girl blew a couple of bubbles through her sneering lips , and asked : " Why ? " She spoke with an aristocratic drawl . It was not affected . " You two fell down the stairs together at Vyvyan Flower 's party . " Tony remembered dimly a bottle party four years back in Knightsbridge when , because of repeated thumps on the wall from an outraged neighbor , it was decided to take all the drinks down into the basement to see the dawn . He remembered himself and a red-headed young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table full of bottles , and their final toboggan  --  like a Cresta run ! He even recollected some of the young person 's remarks . " And I was starting off the next morning for Spain ! " said Lynd . The girl gave a hoarse laugh , a painful sucking in of breath : " Yes , I remember now  --  you insisted upon telling me all about that . You were going to get a mule and ride down the Pyrenees . . . . " She seemed to be saying that as sarcastically as she could , and he resented it . " I did ride down the Pyrenees , " he said . " How frightfully funny . " Lester left them , and as there was nowhere else for them to sit they had to park themselves on a divan in the corner . " A bed built for love , " said Lester , as he pointed them to it . " Do n't mind us . " It was a notorious contention of Lester Blackwood 's that the only thing needed to seduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure friendship he would often offer the keys of his flat to his men friends who were without this convenience . Al-  | though it did get about that he climbed up the fire-escape to watch the performance . " What do you think of this party ? " asked Lynd . " Perfectly ghastly . " " Then why did you come to it ? " A curiosity was stirring in him . This girl , who never looked you in the eyes but stared over your shoulder as she was talking with you , had a powerful fascination . It was snake-like , but  --  it was alluring . She spoke with the minimum of movement , no gestures , no movements of her body , and not the faintest alteration of the level tenor of her voice . Only her face was mobile ; and to Lynd 's question her brows met in a frown . " I do n't know , " she said . " Well , that 's as good a reason as any other , " he said . He got up and dutifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't there anything decent to drink ? " she asked . Lynd questioned Lester who said there might be some whisky left . There had been two bottles , but Pat Byron and the nigger girl had come early , Patrick already half-soused ; and they had drunk one of them right off . Lynd , going into the other room , was directed by the coon to the other bottle . It was on the floor by the bed . " I 'm ' fraid he 's done for this evenin ' , " she said , looking at the silent , sleeping figure on the bed beside her . " Ca n't you take him off my hands ? " " Later , " said Lynd . While he was sitting on the Turkish divan he saw the Negro girl come out . She had on her coat and hat . She stood on her toes to whisper something in Lester 's ear , kissed him , and left . Lynd went back and shook Patrick . He was completely out . " I 'm afraid he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lester who had come into the room . Lester became unaccountably agitated : " No , no , " he said ; " I 've got other plans ! Tony , you will do me a favor , wo n't you ? You will get him out of here ? " " Later , " said Lynd.  | He went back and joined the girl on the couch . " When you 've had enough of this ghastly party , " she drawled , " let 's go out somewhere and find a quiet place where we can have a drink . " Lynd , remembering he had passed a pub at the corner , and telling Lester he would be back , a promise that Lester made him repeat , they left . In the pub the girl leaned with her elbows on the table , taking quiet puffs at a cigarette  --  and said nothing . Finally , at closing time , he said he must go back . " Oh , well , if you must , " she said disgustedly . He explained things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Patrick . " I could wring his . . . neck . " She had used the Army adjective as casually as any British Tommy would use it . Then , clasping her bag under her arm , she walked slightly ahead of Lynd to her car . " It would be so nice , " she said suddenly , " if we could meet somewhere and have a drink tomorrow . Here 's my card . " She gave him a business card which , he saw , bore the name of an Australian newspaper . " I 'm the London correspondent for that , " she drawled . " Good-night . " Back at Lester 's , Lynd asked him : " I say , who is that girl ? " " Felicity Tyrell ? Humph  --  that 's a poser . Father 's an Australian who was knighted for his services to the Empire during the Boer War . Sold them some rifles that would n't go off , I understand . She was born in England . Flick was one of the Bright Young Things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she 's settled down now . Any rate , I 've never got anywhere with her . " Patrick was a problem . Lester , looking anxiously at the clock , broke up his own party before one o'clock . " Now , " he said , " you get that young man out ! " " Where does he live ? " asked Lynd.  | " I du n no . " Lester shook Patrick . Then he shook him savagely . " Byron ! " he yelled in his ear . " Where do you live ? " Patrick mumbled an address , fought off Lester , and rolled over to sleep . " Oh , that 's all right , " said Lynd . " I know the place  --  that 's where he lived before . " As slithery to get a secure grip on as a slimy fish , Patrick was slid downstairs and across the pavement into Lynd 's car . But , after Lester had gone back , Lynd saw the lights go out every time he put his foot on the self-starter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't start . While he was trying to spin it he saw a figure come up the street , halt a minute opposite the car to stare at the huddled Byron , and then dash quickly into Lester Blackwood 's apartment house . As she had to wait until Lester answered the bell , Lynd saw that it was the Negro girl . In an ancient taxi they pulled up before Patrick Byron 's address . The taxi-driver volunteered to help Lynd take Patrick up to the second floor . " I know where it is , " said Lynd . He fished out Byron 's keys and tried every one of them in the lock . Finally he found one that fitted and opened the door . He reached around for the plug and switched on the electric light . " Do n't know where his bedroom is , " he said . There was a shout from a room somewhere , and then a little red-faced man , with gray hair , in blue and white striped pajamas stood covering them with a revolver . " By God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do n't move , do n't move  --  or I 'll blow a hole through you ! Who are you ? What the devil are you doing in my house at this time o ' night ? Answer me that , sir  --  answer me that ! No , Myra , " he called back over his shoulder . " Do n't call for the police . I 'll handle these gentlemen . Now , sir ? . . . " He pointed the revolver at Lynd . Obviously , a military gentleman . An angry one .  | " Speak up ! Out with it ? Why did you tamper with the lock on my door ? " The taxi-driver who could understand none of this had gone a gruesome white . He had let go of Patrick who had piled neatly on the carpet . Lynd knew that if he laughed he would probably get a bullet in him forthwith . So he tried to explain things ; his friend was ill , had given him , in a delirium , this address , where he had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key of the flat . " Deliriums , be damned ! Your friend , sir , whatever your name is , is disgustingly drunk . Get him out . Get him out , I tell you , and let me sleep . " " Well , sir , " said the taxi-driver , when they had Patrick back in the cab . " That was a rare do , that was . Have n't seen the likes o ' that in my experience  --  not in twenty-five years ' drivin ' this same here bloody little bleeding cab . I would n't try it again , sir . " Lynd was searching Patrick 's pockets to see if he could find any letters addressed to Byron which might show his home , but they were all addressed either to his paper or to his club . He could , of course , take Pat to his club , but that would be a scurvy trick to play on a friend in a condition like this . " No , driver , " he said , " I know one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was n't until the taxi clunked to a stop before the door of Lynd 's own house that he realized that there was not a single bedroom free . Christina had one of her cousins staying , so their single guest room was occupied . The only room he could think of  --  as Patrick was now showing signs of violence , and he might break something if left below in the drawingroom  --  was Christina 's workroom at the top of the house . Aside from the sewing machine , there was a sofa there .  | Stealthily , Lynd supporting the heavy weight of the shoulders , the taxi-man carrying the legs , they got Patrick up the stairs . " I 'd be careful of him , sir , " whispered the taxi-driver hoarsely . " ' E might jump out . " " Oh , I know an old trick , " grinned Lynd . " Help me to get off this heavy overcoat . " It was a heavy , navy-blue affair with a thick belt . Lynd reversed it , shoved Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up his back . Then he twisted the belt around , drew it tight , and buckled it at the back . Thus hobbled Patrick could not do anything . They placed him facedown on the couch and slowly tiptoed downstairs , where , from a decanter on the sideboard , Lynd poured himself and the taxi-man a good stiff drink . " Thank'y , sir . This has been a rare night . " Lynd went up to his single bed opposite Christina and went quietly to sleep . " Mr. Lynd ! Mr. Lynd ! " He and Christina were awakened in the morning by one of their two Norwegian maids . They always had their coffee in bed of a morning . But Elsa was not bringing coffee now . Her blue eyes were staring out of her head . " Mr. Lynd , " she said hysterically , " dere iss a man in de house ! " Lynd , who had completely forgotten the previous night , sat up bewildered and rubbed his eyes . He was usually a quick waker but he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . man . . . ? " he muttered . " Where ? " demanded the practical Christina . The Norwegian girl stuck a finger upward . " And his head 's yust like dis . . . . " Elsa tried to turn her own head around backwards . At that they heard the most awful rumpus from the upper stairs :  | " Get the hell out of my way , blast you ! Who do you think I am ? Where am I ? " The voice of Gudrun came : " Yust you stand dere ! " Gudrun was a peasant from the Nordland of Norway . They build them big up there . " Yust you stan ' dere until Ay get Mr. Lynd . . . . " " Lynd ? Lynd ! " Christina and Anthony heard the sound of hysterical male laughter , and then Patrick 's voice : " Tony ? for Christ 's sake , come up here and save me from these savages . There 's a girl got me stymied up here with a broom ! " Lynd led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat the wrong way around and buttoned up the back and his arms flopping forward helplessly like a diver 's . Only his eyes showed above the back of his coat collar . It was a great breakfast . " Tell me , " said Lynd , as they taxied down to his office ( he had telephoned a garage to fetch his car ) , " do you happen to know a girl called Felicity Tyrell ? " " Do I not ! What 's she to you ? " " Nothing  --  yet . " " Then you lay off her . I know at least three men that girl has made drink themselves into dip and dope homes . There 's something uncanny about her . That girl is Death . " " Thanks for the advice . " When he got to his office and telephoned , her voice said : " Oh , hel-lo . . . " It sounded so unpleasant and affected that he reached across with the instrument and put it down . Then he said : " I 've got only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across to the Foreign Office now . I could meet you at the Queen , if you want to ; that 's the pub by Scotland Yard . About half-past twelve ? I say , if you have n't got anything else to do ,  | why do n't we have lunch ? Make it the Ivy , at one . What ? Let 's do both ? Why , that 's great ! See you at the Queen . " He was conscious as he put down the receiver that a definite change had taken place in his life . He never doubted that for an instant . s s s He was not as astonished , therefore , as he should have been at the Ivy , among that gay , theatrical company , when suddenly it had been decided that they should spend the next week-end in the country together . " My car 's bust , " he said , describing how last night , trying to kindle it with a weak battery , he had broken the Bendix on his self-starter . " We 'll use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Patrick 's latch-keys and the striped gentleman , with the revolver , in pajamas , she gave that hacking sinister laugh , leaning forward with her hands against her forehead . Sardonic , he decided , was a milk-and-water word for that laughter . She did sound like Death ! s s s When Patrick Byron asked him afterwards what he thought of Flick Tyrell , he replied that he had found her most invigorating . Pat laughed . " Flick 's father is lovely , " said Pat . " You know , if you go to Scotland Yard , they will tell you that the best pickpockets in England are the Spaniards from Soho , the best sharepushers are Americans , the best confidence men are the Australians , and the best blackmailers , a vocation that requires the maximum of guts and heartiness , are English aristocrats . . . well , Flick 's father is what I would consider an all-around gentleman .  | " The College of Heralds , " gurgled pale Patrick , enchanted by his own similes , " could sing lovely songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Gold Reef . . . in Geoffrey Tyrell 's pedigree . All of which merely became romantic when Geoff Tyrell bought Bentham and ran his own pack of hounds up in Yorkshire . We English have our principles , you know . " I 'll tell you the kind of man he is  --  he 's a human rhino . The mill-owning parvenu who had built Bentham before him had a lake built on the grounds . . . with a flock of stone herons artistically fishing among its rushes . . . " Patrick leaned back and laughed softly . " I was too young to be in on it , but my father tells me that when Geoff Bentham wanted to give a pre-view of his lovely red-haired little girl to immediate post-war society , he gave a pretentious houseparty at Bentham to which he had invited , or blackmailed , half of England 's future admirals . . . and you know what naval blokes are . When they were having breakfast Sunday morning , one of them drew the attention of the whole table to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little heron had a kipper on its beak . . . . " Hah ! " laughed Pat , " you can see what Flick 's had to put up with ! The old man 's answer , however , was classic . Bentham was famous for its wines and long dinners , but for the rest of that houseparty all the British Navy got for lunch or dinner was beer and kippers . . . breakfasts were the promise of what things might have been ; for they were the same as Sunday 's fatal breakfast . . . with cold grouse , and everything that is good to eat . . . . That story did him a lot of good in London , however , especially in the City , where he now has the reputation of being a man who can hardly wait to be hit ? before he hits back . " At the present moment he lives at his club  --  dyes his hair jet black  --  except for little gray tufts over the ears which he thinks make him look like Forbes Robertson  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk as you go out in the morning you will always see a genteel little package from the florist for Sir Geoffrey Tyrell , containing an orchid , or a gardenia for his buttonhole . . . . If you 're ever forced into the ditch sometime by a vast cream-colored Rolls-Royce , coming down the North Road as if it owns it , that 's Sir Geoffrey 's chauffeur . . . he encourages them to drive that way . " " Hum . . . . " Tony let out his breath . " And his daughter ? " " Flick ? . . . Ah . . . . Some smart aleck put it across her in the early ' twenties , in London , and the old boy was so furious that his treasure had been de-flowered that he took her off on a trip around the world . . . to get her out of the picture . What happened out there no one knows . . . not for sure . People who came back from Pekin said she had made the hell of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Attache  --  smack in the middle of a picnic party  --  and everyone had taken it for granted they were practically married ! From what I know of Flick Tyrell myself , I should say that poor Hun was the one love of her life . Why she hit him , Flick never said : I do n't suppose even her Old Man knows . The Pekin people say the German just raised hell about it  --  he was a Baron . And Flick had slugged him ! " At any rate " ? Pat looked at Tony seriously , as if even he was oppressed by the thoughts it invoked ? " when the lovely Flick started to be seen at London bottle-parties again she was no longer the inarticulate , hoydenish , puzzling little Tyrell girl . . . . You know , the French say we 're cold because we English hate to shake hands when we meet . . . well . . . Flick does a lot more than merely kiss you on both cheeks .... " Tony felt mute and oppressed . The thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenties distributed their loveliness  --  more lightly than their brothers would even shake hands , as Pat implied  --  nearly destroyed him . It was another blow that life was inexorably striking at his flickering youth . He must hammer the life out of these childish castles he was  | always building . They had always been sold from within . long before he got to them . He had thought she might be joking at first , as he stood , feeling rather foolish , in front of the Goring Hotel . He had left his bag with the hall porter . But no , prompt on the stroke of one her blue Riley swung around the corner . She lived in Westminster Square . And he found himself speaking quite naturally as he asked the porter to fetch his bag . She wore a green-and-black checked coat with a scarlet knitted hat . They took the Kingston By-pass . England was already taking on that golden haze that is her glory in the spring , of grass and field and budding beechwoods . Distances were powder-blue . She drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it irked her to be thwarted by anybody else . They said practically nothing on the drive . This was a relief after Kyra 's prattle , and even Christina 's conversation , who knew and appreciated every changing view of the English countryside . He loved England deeply . Soon the apple orchards would be in white blossom , and the soft air would smell of growing hops , and the red-roofed oasthouses would bask in the lazy sun . God could not have designed a setting more blissful for love . " What about a drink ? " he said . " Marvelous . We 'll stop at the next nice-looking pub . " " In America , " he said to try and appear interesting , " our distances are sharp and clear . Hard . We do n't have this pastel haziness . I do n't know much about Art  --  but when I first saw the paintings of Constable I thought they could n't be true . " She rewarded him by frowning thoughtfully , and saying :  | " Yes , you 're right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . " " When was that ? " " Oh , years ago , " she said . She had a beautifully slender neck , with a lean jaw ; although , he decided , her best feature was the line from her forehead to along her straight nose . He had plenty of chance to look at this profile , for he noticed again that her greenish eyes never met his , but always looked over his shoulder as he talked to her  --  as if she saw someone there in the Land of Mist behind him . There was something sad , reminiscent , regretful in this trait . She was a bitter woman , he decided . s s s He remembered little about that night , except that they were caught in a violent rainstorm as they were crossing a heath ; and she suggested that they put up at that little pub for the night . It was a pub that was not used to having visitors , " grand people from London , " even temporary honeymooners ; and it was some time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratified him that she did not seem to mind in the least the lowly status of the pub  --  Christina was inclined to be fussy , even quarrelsome about such things  --  and this girl wolfed more than her fair share of the platter of bacon and eggs that had been put before them . The apologies of the fat landlady , he saw with pleasure , were not needed with Miss Felicity Tyrell . The room they were given had just had its carpet taken up ; and perhaps the one thing he would never forget about that night was that when he got up in the dark , he put his bare foot down on about six tacks at the same time . " My God ! " he cried . Felicity reached about for the matches and lighted the candle on the chair beside them . She looked at him extracting the  | tacks and gave a laugh . One of those painful-to-hear intakings of breath . " The safest place for you , " she said , " is to pop back into bed . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of whisky they had taken up to their room with them , and saw there was a good half of it left . Doubtfully dusting the floor with his foot for tacks he ventured across to the washstand and brought back the pitcherful of water and the solitary glass . He sat there on the edge of the bed and talked . He began to talk a little wildly at last , and then they became engaged in a very original argument . Neither of them could remember what it was the next morning . But it had been interesting . It had been fun , lying in bed and talking like that . The strangest impression that he carried away from that night was its peace . An assured ease such as he had never known with any woman . With others , you always had to be on guard against feminine misunderstanding that might shatter things . But not with this girl . That two comparative strangers could , under such carnal conditions , talk as innocently and impartially as they had was a miracle that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felicity Tyrell , he soon admitted to himself , was unbelievably the one woman he had been looking for  --  the perfect combination of brains and beauty . If it had not been for her shocking past of the ' twenties . But then , every girl of Flick 's period and set seemed to have one . That was precisely what was the trouble with the world ; there was a stupid contempt for her own virtue even in Felicity . Flick was so damnably unrepentant about it . " Oh , for God 's sake , do stop preaching ! " she said . " I 'm not preaching . I 'm just trying to tell you something . Damn it all , ca n't you see that when an ordinary human being  | comes in here and sees that horrible nimbus of pansies and unhelievables all you bright young things have hanging about you  --  that he sheers off ? He ca n't stand it , I tell you . It makes him sick . He 's actually afraid to fall in love with one of you because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen of those odious pups who all feel that they have the right to feel free and easy about you . . . . My God , with your brains , have n't you got enough intelligence to see that ? " " I 'm not gong to be talked to as if I were in a Reform Home . ome . So there . " " Go on , then ! Be a . . . well , be a . . . " He soon realized the danger of these talks with Flick . They never got him anywhere . And it soon came that the instant Flick felt that she was being lectured to she invented merciless affairs of her past which simply excoriated him . His imagination sizzled under the very memory of them . And then he discovered that when Flick found this out , she began to play it as a game . There was no limit to which she could n't imagine things  --  for his destruction . He was appalled by it . He had not known her a week before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was while they were sitting in his car in Piccadilly , waiting for the green light to go on . The information had not shocked him at the time ; he knew the man , he had the reputation of being a danger to young women ; later , things came to a point where he would get up and leave the room when he saw this man enter it . That was when he knew that he was becoming inevitably more and more fond of her . When he began to realize that this was probably permanent . Felicity felt this as well , and said one day , as they were waiting for another traffic light : " It 's so nice to have something that will last ! " He was aware , when she said that , that many other men must have left her . They would leave her because they had faced the same trial that he was headed for : they had fallen in love with her  --  and then found they could not face any longer her straightforward talk about her relations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so they had quit . And in this way , he knew , Flick had paid for her arrogant looseness , and was lonely . There was an exciting and entirely satisfying interregnum between that first country week-end , so strange in its frankness  --  or perhaps its casualness , because what she had said about herself then , and her relations with other men , had not affected him  --  and these heated days when at the very mention of one of Flick 's affairs he would fly into a rage . When Flick began to demonstrate how uninhibited she was he wanted to run away from her . " No one else , " she said , " has ever talked to me the way you do . " " Why should they ? " he said bitterly , " when you always seem to have been so obliging . Unless they happened to be in love with you . Arid then they 'd say something ! " She fell silent at that . Love was a word that Felicity never used . This second phase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sense of values , opened a stage of warfare that raged between them for months . They fought it out in pubs in their pre-luncheon meetings , they were still attacking each other as they sat in one or the other 's motorcar , drinking tea outside the midnight coffee stalls dotted about London . No victories were ever granted , no defeats were ever admitted . The casus belli was Tony 's continued criticism of Flick for ever having submitted to the life of the ' twenties , and Flick 's furious retaliation against what she declared was his intolerably blind conceit . In moments of expansion , in this ease that he had discovered with her , Tony had told Flick some of the adventures of his own life . And he could never find one in hers that she , now , could not find one in his own to match him with . In this unique naturalness he had found with Flick , Tony had discussed his affairs with a frankness that he had never felt free to use with  | ybody else . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeons dispassionately discussing a patient 's history . But it had been folly . . . for Flick preserved every Item for ammunition , and used them over and over again . The distracting part of these arguments was that Flick would not agree that she had done wrong , and therefore allow him to win past that to where he could place her back upon the pedestal . She would not go there . Instead she flung his own deeds back to be weighed against hers . Not only that , she declared that he was a hypocrite to criticize her . The result was a morose purpose , unfolded within him , to pay her back with her own coin . If she was going to glory in her waywardness , he could be dissolute too . In this hard way , with the bits in their teeth , they raced against each other . He could drink desperately , whole-heartedly now . It amused him to make Flick drink . It was rare now when they had their moments of peace together ; it was neck and neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that they were increasing the pace to a dangerous degree . They both became fascinated by the reckless danger of their lives . Neither of them would cry stop . He was going to make Flick knuckle under . And if she did n't , she would have to pay the price of his own collapse . Once or twice , when she had become alarmed at what he was doing to himself and tried to restrain him , he had merely laughed . " All right , " he said , " you know . You know why I 'm doing this . " " Know what ? " said Flick . " You know . . . trying to prove that every damn thing you did was right ! " He was aware that his conduct had the element of madness in it . " Well , what in the hell would you do , " cried Flick one night , " if I did admit I was wrong ? " Not that I 'm going to ! " she added quickly .  | The worst injury that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfaithfulness . The physical contact played the minor part in this mad carouse . Christina herself did not stress this . What Christina resented now was the shell of Tony that came home . " Go ahead , " she said to him petulantly one night , when he came in after dinner was half over ? " I do n't care what you do . Have a mistress . Have half a dozen mistresses . . . . " Tony realized that Chris was tried beyond endurance . " But I do n't want half a dozen mistresses ! " he cried . " Ca n't you see ? " " No . I ca n't . " Christina 's cool lips were printed in a straight red line . Tony hated to see that . Christina could look lovely in storm , real storm , but he hated to see the droop of sadness in it . There was , he soon found , very little drooping tonight . " I 've put up with a lot from you , " said Chris . " But I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect little fool not to see it . I do n't care what she does to you  --  it 's what she 's making you do to me that I 'm complaining about . What on earth you see in her I ca n't understand . " " Well . . . er . . . we get along well together . " " Get along well ! . . . Peter , ca n't you see you 've been in nothing but trouble ever since you 've known the girl ? Do n't you know that all your friends are talking about it  --  the mad way you are drinking yourself straight to hell ? You will , you know . You ca n't keep it up at this pace all the time . Something will happen to you some day . You do know that , do n't you , Peter ? And you do n't want to make me not be in love with you , do you ? " He fell silent at that . He knew that he could n't explain to Christina these oases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were too incredible . He could n't explain , although he did intend to make a stiff try , , that all this drinking was largely because of his own pigheaded self . He would drink on ,  | and on , and on . . . Why ? . . . Simply because Flick had gone wrong in the ' twenties  --  and would n't admit it . Damn her . But that this should affect him so could also not be explained , even to himself ; he was like a wild maverick , unbranded , badly needing a bit and halter . . . . " I guess I 've just got a lot of the original devil in me . You do n't think I 'm mean , do you ? I try to protect you in other I t o ngs . " " I do n't think you 're mean , Peter  --  I think you 're just a fool . And you wo n't see it . What you 're doing , Tony , is dancing along the edge of disaster . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a lot these days , and wish I could get through to you . Why do n't you chuck it all and you and I have a trip around the world ? " He shook his head . The answer to his disintegration lay in London . " No , " he said ; " there 's no use running off . I 've got to work things out here . Let 's hope they come out right . " He looked at her . She had the perfect quality of repose . The book she had put down when she began this argument , she now picked up from the arm of her chair before the fireplace . He thought what a savage irony lay in most of life 's realizations . How , for ten years , he had made unknowing Chris suffer because of an imaginary Kyra that he was torturing himself with . Ten of the most incorrectly aimed years of his life . He could have built a good and sound life with Christina during that time , if Kyra 's ghost had not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not made this life . And now the petty quarrels that had meant merely a passing annoyance and discomfort in those days , were becoming accumulative . They were taking on a momentum . Without seeming the least able to prevent them , these daily quarrels , all of his own making , were like an ebb tide daily carrying him away from Christina . " You know what 's the matter with you ? " she said . " You 're afraid of that girl . "  | " Oh , nonsense . " " You are . She 's put a spell on you . " s s s One night , when Christina was spending the week-end with some friends in the country , a habit he was encouraging more and more , he had arranged to meet Flick at Hubler 's in Fitzroy Square . Most of their engagements were in pubs . He usually managed to buy a few drinks for her every day before lunch , and he was now deliberately avoiding luncheons he should have gone to in connection with his work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always met before he went home to dinner and sat drinking and chatting in some pub until the very last minute . Often , he suspected , she was deliberately trying to make him late . Did it gratify her sense of possession  --  or was this all part of her program to wreck his home ? With Felicity he always felt like a man who is taking his boat through dangerous rocks . Her own punctuality , he had long since realized , was one of her greatest attractions to men . Men appreciate when they do n't have to sit and wait and wonder what someone , whom they are waiting to go out with , is doing with someone else . They always suspect the worst . And tonight , he had to wait and wonder a long time . He tried to hold back from drinking as he watched the minute hand of the clock slowly drag , so brazenly indifferent , around the cruel dial . Drink , with Flick , often sent him into a rage these days . He eyed with malevolence a harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in sandals , green corduroy bloomers and a Tyrolean jacket . He recognized the puffy-faced woman on a stool as a former Bright Young Thing of the ' twenties , having her continual round of gins . He recalled her story ; how she had taken the second-rate art critic she happened to wake up with one morning to the Registrar 's office and married him . This bar , at opening time in the morning , was a museum of once-lovely girls who had been the Girl  | ho Would Do Anything of their few exciting years . It required an enormous amount of brains , he thought , for a girl to have those reckless years , and then escape . Felicity had clone this . She had , in fact , made him think there could be no ( god ; Flick had sinned so contemptuously  --  and met no retri ! MI ion . She bragged about that . Ile would take it out on her tonight . He was not going to be stood up like this , kicking his heels in this pub for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with somebody else . I le was just about to leave when Hubler came to the bar and said he was wanted on the ' phone . It was Flick , very tight , saying she would be along right away . They had been going down to Marlow and he tried to tell her that if she did not hurry , the hotel would be shut . The way she quickly cut him off and sputtered : " Oh , we can talk about that when I get there , " made him think she was speaking in the presence of somebody else . He had half a mind to get on to the exchange and try to find out where the call had come from . But then he thought that he would rather not know . He had got that way now . . . . Half an hour later , when he was again on the point of going , he was aware of a row going on outside the door . He paid no attention to it at first , until he heard fat Hubler protesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old customer of ours . She iss a very respectable lady ! " Then he had some idea of what he was about to see . It was Flick . With her was a South African painter . Lynd knew him by sight . And that was all he wanted to know of him , because Flick had had an affair with him . Now here they both were , the South African in a very noisy argument with the taxi-driver . Lynd watched the scene . " Lousy barstard ! . . . " the taxi-driver announced to the grinning crowd . " ' E 's been an ' committed a nuisance in my cab ! . . . ' E 's been sick ! ' E can tyke his choice . . . . ' E 's going to give me a quid to put things right after ' im . . . or I calls the perlice. . . . " 114  | The scene blurred for Lynd . He saw Felicity 's twisted lips and the open , starting eyes of the South African as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coatlapel ; and old Hubler , all beard and fat cheeks below two upraised arms ; and all around them a ring of lamp-lit faces laughing . . . . " ' It ' im , guvnor ! " was the advice given by the crowd to the helpless South African . " Do n't let ' im talk to yer like that . " " The likes o " im ? ' e could n't ' it nobody , " a woman jeered . " Why do n't the loidy stand up for her man ? " Felicity was earning the British crowd 's disapproval by trying to walk out of this scene . She had got as far as Hubler 's door when she saw Lynd standing there , facing her . She tried to put on her challenging sneer . He stepped aside to let her in . And then he walked rapidly around the street and got into his car . As he let himself into the empty house in Cheyne Walk , he heard the ' phone ringing . It was Flick . " Darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " " Why ? " " Tony . . . " " Yes ? " " Do . " " Oh , all right . I was just going to bed . " " Wait for me ! " He went down to the cellar under the stairs and brought up a bottle of whisky and some glasses . While he was waiting for Flick he stared around his study . One wall was lined with books ; there was a photo of one of his early sailing boats and another of himself in the R.F.C. , and over his desk was the cast of a perfect 2/-pound trout he had caught only fifty minutes ' drive out of London . He had once done a lot of work here . It pained him when he thought of how very little he  | ever sat in this room now , how little he was ever in the house . he had brought the whisky into his study because the drawing-room was essentially the property of Christina . Even when she was not there her personality pervaded it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the merciless Flick . " You drive me crazy ! " he said to Flick . " What in God 's name are you made of ? " " Be sensible , darling . " " That 's what I 'm trying to be . " " No , you 're not . . . you 're just being silly . I know I was naughty to be late . " " Late ! Naughty ! " " Yes . . . because that 's all I did tonight that you can take any exception to . And you know what I mean . And look here , " she said , making her eyes dilate and look fierce ; " why did you run off and leave me like that ? That was n't nice . Was it ? " He held up his hand . " Do n't ! " he said . " I know that argument ; it 's one of your old ones  --  that the best defense is a quick attack . Here 's the other one : A person can get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Fine . And here 's the last : You 're jealous of my past life . ' That 's three of them from your box of tricks , is n't it ? " He stopped and looked at her . " Well , I am jealous of your past . I am jealous of all the other men you 've slept with . But ? " He paused , for he felt it was very important , this thing that he had to tell her . And he knew he could not make it sound sufficiently impressive . " I am jealous , " he said , " and I know that that gives you nothing but satisfaction . Secret now  --  but later you will try and throw it in my face . But I 'll tell you why I do n't think that you will throw it . Just think for a minute ; you and I have become pretty much part of the other ? and just weigh in the scales the satisfaction you 'll get out of knowing I 'm jealous  --  against the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just why I 'm leaving you  --  not because of  | your relations with other men . . . but because I 'm jealous of them ! " We 're both rotters , " said Lynd , sitting down heavily . s s s The streets were glistening when he went to the door to let Flick in ; and as they sat there now they heard the cheerful sound of the seep of rain on the trees in the garden and coursing noisily down the spout . They sat in deep chairs before the wood fire that he had put a new log on when she telephoned . It was now crackling merrily . " This is not merely an affair , ' " he growled morosely , " this thing between you and me . Or is it ? Do you want it to be ? " Flick sat there , her greenish eyes seeing something in the flames . She frowned : " Yes , you 're right there . It is not an affair . I do n't want it to be . But you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never live in the past . That 's why these other casual affairs have never meant anything to me . " Then , as if she felt she had surrendered some ground to him , her lip curled : " The first couple of times , with someone new  --  yes . " " Ugh ! " he shuddered . " There you go again ! " he said . " It 's no question of morals with me . It 's just my own blasted imagination . " " But that sort of thing does n't do you any harm  --  not when you 're young . " " Oh , does n't it  --  look what I have been saying just now ; that I 'm jealous . As it happens , I know half a dozen men in town who you yourself brag have slept with you . What the hell do you think I think when we meet and shake hands ? We ought to have an Old School tie ! " At that , she choked and gave that hacking laugh . " Darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make me laugh ! " " Oh , go to hell ! " They were friendly again almost at once . He was furious with her and felt that he would like to kill her ; yet he knew  | there was more solid companionship with her now , even with this ghastly conversation , than he had known with any other woman . With a strange magic ( perhaps the opiate quality that Patrick had spoken of as Death ? ) her presence soothed him . MI would have been well this evening had he not gone into 11w drawing-room to fetch something , as she was leaving . Flick followed him and was standing by the door . " I have never seen a room , " he heard her say , " which had so much negative good taste . " " Have n't you ? " He spoke without looking up . " That 's too bad . " " Y-es . . . " Flick uttered her most sarcastic drawl . " All . . . this ! " He found himself trembling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace and pale cluck-egg blue walls against which the old mahogany furniture stood out dark and shining , particularly a Chippendale bookcase which was the pride of Christina 's heart . On the floor was a faded , delightful old Indian carpet which her father had given her . There were one or two good paintings on the walls , and a few which had been done by their friends . Christina had a genius for flowers and the room had been arranged to take them , although now of course there were none here . Before him , on her desk , was a neat pile of her account books and a little photograph of Zeppelin , the dachshund . " How would you arrange it ? " asked Tony evenly . " I would have just one picture . . . one good one . . . something that would dominate the whole room . . . that would inspire you to look at it . " " I see . . . a Matisse ? " " Yes . . . something like that . " He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | parvenue . The thing you ca n't understand . . . that 's simply beyond your understanding . . . is that this room is lived in ! This room is n't fixed this way to impress someone else . . . this room is for us . Damn it all . . . you , with all your cheap talk about paintings . . . Christina has more judgment in her little finger than you have in your whole mind . . . clever as you are . You make me sick ; you talk like an art student ! . . . One good picture . . . oh , my God . . . it 's the kind of thing an author would hunt about for weeks to show that a character was cheap ! " He was wild that anyone should dare to criticize Christina 's house . " Now you 're showing some of the lousy sense of values you 've picked up during life . Do n't make me laugh . " " You 've liberated me ! " she said dramatically . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since he had known her that he really felt her master . He saw she was crying , but it did not stir a chord in him . He was utterly cold . It was such a surprising sensation that he telephoned as quickly as he could for a taxi . He wanted to get Felicity out of his sight while this mood still held on . There was no knowing . . . he knew he was n't safe . . . what she might do to make him weak again . She had flung herself , with every indication of remaining , on the sofa . He remained standing , finishing his drink , until he heard the taxi-man at the door . " There 's your cab , " he said . " Thanks . I 'm glad you did that . I feel much happier now . " " So do I. " He helped her into the cab , told the man where to go , and went back into the house . " By George ! " he said . He stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One . . . perfect . . . picture ... " It was the first time for nearly a year that he went to bed with an easy heart .  | But . it was a false peace . Felicity Tyrell and he were both too well known to get away with any clandestine meetings in their London life . It might be all very well for them to see the lu t ual un-sinfulness of their relations  --  the way both of them rejoiced in just the mental companionship they had found with rac li other . But the world was not built to accept relations like that . A juicy bit of scandal like this was not going to be neglected by his eager friends . People began to " talk . " And Christina , quite naturally , hit back . " Well , I should think I would say what I damn well like ! " she told Tony . " What do you think I am ? That I am going to sit down under a thing like this ? Not much . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . you 're unbelievable ! " What he had tried uncomfortably to point out was the sordulness of such a quarrel . There was nothing nice about this . I n Chris , Flick had taken on an enemy well worthy of her steel . They had , in their journalistic set , several mutual acquaintances . Well , Chris was seeing that they would not remain mutual any longer . She was already giving them their choice . Their small world was storming . He really did n't give a damn that night what Flick had said about the Chelsea house . He had brought that on himself . It was a nice house . He liked it . He had often said so to Flick . And he had said it just once too often , it appeared . Even an angel could not be asked to admire her adversary 's handiwork . What had sent him into such a maniac rage , perhaps , was that up until that very moment he had been foolishly imagining he could have this relationship with Flick without provoking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , by violating the conventions , he had made everybody 's life public property . He tried to lose himself in his work , and with his almost pre-natal dislike of politicians in general he found plenty of disconcerting information to cable about the way the sooth-  | sayers were trying to plaster over with mere words the appalling cracks that were appearing everywhere in the European facade . The slick legal phrases of Britain 's foreign minister at the League were , he knew , not the answer to give to the seriously intentioned Germany that he had just been reporting . And he worked off a lot of his personal suppressions by trying to make American readers aware of the Geneva fiasco . But this gave little more than a passing fillip to his days . He wanted to get away from the London scene . When he saw a lull looming ahead in his work , he discussed the temporary escape with Felicity over a luncheon at the Escargot in Greek Street . " For a while , " he said moodily , " I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politician in this world . I 'd like to get out of Europe  --  mentally , at any rate . Where could we go ? " She was nervous , and rolled little bread crumbs with her slender fingers . He was jumpy also . He had not noticed it himself , how his nerves were going . But Flick pointed it out . " Have n't you still got a couple of weeks ' vacation coming to you ? You know the way you told me you were rushed off from the Shetlands to Berlin ? Could n't you snatch ten days now ? And we could go off somewhere ? The place , of course , is Spain ! Spain would be marvelous  --  for both of us . " Easter was early that year . As it happened , he had already arranged that Christina should take the car and join the Mallards down in Cornwall . They had a cottage there . He wired the paper and got a reluctant consent that he should take ten days off . Chris had already left ; and he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole bottle of whisky in a zestful argument they had about Life that night . But , now that they were safe and securely together again Flick got into another of her sarcastic , mocking moods . They did not sleep together that night .  | It did not make matters better , on the motor-ferry over to ieppe , when Flick announced that she had already made this rip to Spain , twice , with other men . For it was an announceWent , quite out of the blue , when he was sitting there peace ( idly on a camp-stool , staring at the sea , trying to recover from the amount of whisky they had put away the previous evening . His nerves were snapping . " Why on earth do you have to say such things ! " " Because you 're so damned pi ! " " Ti ! Pious ? Me ? Now what 's the matter with you ? " " Oh , all that talk you went in for last evening . . . how much better in bed Kyra was than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never said such a thing ! You know it ! What I said as ? " " That everything was different when you 1-o-ved someone ! " " Oh , shut up . " In that mood they reached Dieppe . Dieppe , with its memories of summer and Christina , and days . . . God knows why he had thought them so dull . " If you 're going to be like this nll the way to Spain , " he rasped as they waited for the French Customs officials , " we 're going to have a swell time ! " " There 's your diplomatic friend . Why do n't you ask him to come along with us ? " " I will ! " Hambro , in the American Embassy at Paris was waving good-by to them from the railway platform . A dyspeptic young man , every inch the gentleman . Tony rushed across to him . " Where are you going ? " he demanded . " Why  --  Paris , of course . " " Well , come along with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rouen . Fortier ! " He saw Flick 's eyes expand with anger as he and Hambro , the porter , and the bags came back . It gave him tremendous enjoyment . " Lots of room , " he said , jerking his and Flick 's  | bags about to make room for Hambro . " Do n't mind the back seat , do you ? No . . . take that myself . . . . Miss Tyrell will drive . . . What , Felicity ? " " This is kind ! " murmured Hambro , obviously startled by the look given him . " I  --  you would n't have lunch with me on the boat . N-now I 'll give you a dinner in Rouen . " " Rouen ? " said Felicity . " Rouen . Of course Rouen , " said Tony . " Now hop in . Customs over . . . papers passed . . . whoopsy-daisy . . . this is marvelous . " He lay back and laughed . " I say ! " said Hambro to Felicity ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So were all Frenchmen along the road of that hurtling Riley . For a moment , hanging on to the bouncing back seat , Tony was afraid he might have overdone things . Flick , in her rage , was quite capable of steering them into the nearest truck . He knew that Hambro would have something to say about this in Paris ! Felicity , with the smile of a cherub , pulled softly to a stop before the Hotel des Quatre Nations in Rouen . " You must come on with us much further , " she said to Hambro . " Awfully good of you . . . but I simply would n't think of it . . . . I suppose you and Tony want to push on fast . . . eh . . . perhaps . . . I 've victimized you enough already . . . ? " For a moment Tony had a qualm ; Hambro was n't so simple as he looked . But Flick was there ahead of him . " Not on your life ! " said she . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . . . how silly of me . " It was an excellent dinner . Flick , rejecting suggestions , practically ordered it . She almost got the most expensive wine . until Tony , firmly aided by Hambro , picked one half-way down the list . The bill was unbelievable . And while Hambro was changing some English pounds to pay for it , Flick said she would like to have a brandy .  | " Now , " said Flick , when they had seen Hambro into the ution , " will you be good ? " " I will , " said Tony . s s s I t was heaven to travel with someone who did n't give a ontinental damn for time , dates , what time they ate , where when they slept , what cafes they stopped to drink at or ow long they lingered in them . Lynd reveled in the unaccusmed freedom of such casualness . Not like the Mallards . It is ue , the Mallards did move about with an astonishing cornort , even in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , if they did not get it , everyone else was ade to feel sorry for it . In that they were no different from e usual Englishman abroad , who travels , always in the hope f reforming the Continent . But Lynd loathed all the fuss and other . The Mallards said it was weakness on his part ; but he ould much rather not have eaten at all than send the hamnd-eggs back to be cooked separately , instead of the homoeneous mass the Germans always made of them . He hated rguments about food . Food was n't worth it . " Thank God , " he said fervently to Flick , " you do n't care or such things . " " My sweet , " she said , in one of those rare , but extremely precious moments , when she spoke directly to him . " One of my few virtues is that I do not get on a man 's nerves . " " You 've had so much experience , " he said bitterly . " Yes , my sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the whole root of the thing . The tie that bound them together when they quarreled with each other  --  battles which would have sunk less veteran ships  --  was that they both had had experience . Painful thought  --  so many  | of Flick 's virtues were the consequence of her wantonness . And in here  --  in these infrequent moments when Flick dropped her guard  --  Tony thought he sometimes saw another Flick . An entirely different woman . Spain , with Flick , was chaotic . . . a blur of disasters . They drove quickly out of San Sebastian and up into the mountains where Pampeluna , with its buff walls and faded red roofs , stands upon its plateau . In a corner of the main square he found the Montoya brothers still running their famous little hotel . The Spaniards met them as the car came to a halt alongside the arcades . And when they saw who had come back , the Montoya brothers immediately took Lynd and Flick into their private office  --  its walls hung with photographs of famous bullfighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish hospitality , and clapped their hands for a maid to bring two bottles of their best white sherry . He saw at once that Flick , long used to being the center of attraction , was jealous about the warmth of this welcome that he had received . It was from the Hotel Montoya that he had set off on the long mule ride down the Pyrenees four years before . Only a few days after the night in London when he and Flick had had that Cresta run down the basement steps at Vyvyan Flower 's party . Since he had met Flick they had often discussed what a pity it was he had not brought her along then . For five wasted months he had wandered freely , wherever he wanted , all over Spain . From the winter snows of the Pyrenees to the white walls of Cadiz during Carnival time . He sighed now at the wasted opportunity . Flick , with her lip beginning to curl , was , he could see , deliberately setting out to have an angry carouse . She began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety of all Spanish nightlife . " You 're so damn hypocritical , " she drawled . She was egging  | Spaniards into suggesting some excitement . She would do ? thing . It would also be something that would shock the aniards . Her disregard for all the harassing conventions of le was perhaps Flick 's chief charm . In this case it proved sastrous . It began when the bewildered bullfighter brothers Iced would Flick like to see " the Montmartre of Pampena . " Flick , with that curl of her lips , announced she did not hew there was such a thing . " You know what it means ? " said Tony . He had suffered so g from Flick 's baiting him for his alleged priggishness that resolved now to give her the full blast of her arrogant freem . " Prig ! " " All right . Go as far as you like as far as I am concerned . " The white sherry was affecting both of them equally . Tony new that although the badgered Spaniards had suggested it as joke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wn . " The Montoya brothers would never have the same reect for him again . However , it would be worth losing even hat to see Flick thoroughly shocked at last . And Pampeluna , e felt , could do it . " You asked for it , " said Tony . It is not much fun to watch people being lascivious . The bullfighter brothers were unquenchable . Lynd hated Flick for Watching it . In an ultimate house , which they had reached after a mysterious drive where the headlights shone on rows of tree trunks , they found a young Spanish aristocrat playing the guitar while the girls danced a brothel-version of the flamenca until they were entirely naked . " I spik English , " said the young guitar player , sidling suggestively up to Flick as he twanged the strings . Then , seeing Tony 's look upon him , he hurriedly apologized , " You may think it infra dig , senor , to see me , a gentleman , playing the guitar in a Spanish cat-house . . . but , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . all the great Spanish artists did that . " Tony 's reply , whatever it might have been , was smothered  | in the plump breasts of a Spanish girl . For some time , during the dance of the flamenca , she had been eyeing him , pointing at his head , and making remarks about his hair to the other girls . That belligerent head of sandy hair , and the scylla-blue eyes , had fascinated her . Now she took a running jump across the room , landed in Tony 's lap , and threw a scissors around him with her smooth , muscular legs . Pulling Tony towards her , she jammed her lips against his . He had never felt so silly in his life . When he broke the scissors hold and pushed her off , she seized his arm , jerked him towards her and then , skipping around him , threw a doubleNelson on his head . By this time the brothel was in convul1 sions of laughter . The guitar players were shouting bets , mimicking the red-bereted bookees in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently , was the strong-man of Pampeluna . Even in his anguish , Tony had to laugh at the thought of how easily she must have tossed the little Basques about . Finally , he got a grip on her . She was young , very firm , frantic as a wildcat as he bore her inexorably to the floor . She bit her lips not to cry when he put pressure on the hammer-lock . Then he released it , kicked her legs from under her , and jumped on her chest . In that position , holding her flat , he raised one arm . " Bueno ? " he asked the uproarious room . " Si , si , senor . . . bueno , bueno . . . ! " It was a great success . But in the meantime the guitar player had been making advances towards Felicity . He had her backed in a corner and was now walking around in small circles before her , chanting . . . " Oh . . . la-la-lee-yay0000 . . . . " Flick , frightened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony . For a moment Tony had a mind to let the young Spaniard scare her some more ; it would serve her right . She had asked for this orgy . But when the female strong-man started to embrace him again he decided they had both had enough . " Noblesse oblige ! " said Tony , when he paid the enormous  | count that Madame presented for the sweet champagne . He used long enough to admire the 1901 , Queen Victoria penny , hick she wore , silvered , on her porch of a bosom ; then , leavg the bullfighter brothers somewhere upstairs , he took Flick 's n and hustled her into the graying street . " 1 t occurs to me , " said Lynd , as they were walking slowly rocs the square , watching the roof-tops of Pampeluna emerge ainst the greenish morning sky , " that you and I , my sweet , ve had just about as idiotic an evening as anyone could . till . . . it 's harmless . That 's the charm of these Spaniards . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place like that ? " She shook her head . " Never , my sweet . Never . That 's the rst time I 've ever been in a place like that with anyone . I ink it was awful . " " That 's fine , " he said , humbled . Then , " But why with me ? " " I just wanted to see if you would take me there . " " Why ? What on earth would that prove ? " " Oh , you amuse me . I wanted to see your conscience at ork . You 're so funny . " " Well , it did n't work , did it ? " " No , " she said . " But you still think it was wrong to take e there . " In silence they finished the last half of that long square , nged on the hotel door until a wretched Spaniard roused imself somewhere in the interior , and they went up to their room . A newly opened bottle of the famous white sherry stood on their dressing-table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , Flick . You can say what you want ; but you know that we are both of us egging each other on to have the usual drunken fight . I do n't say we will ever admit it  --  but you and I have got something between us that both of us have been looking for all our lives . You know what I mean , too . A desire to live a decent normal life together . And not just this . " " Perhaps . " " You 've seen too damn much . " " So have you . "  | IIe handed Flick her glass , and put his arm around her waist as he did so . " Ah , my sweet . . . " She put her head against his chest . " Yes , " she said , " more than I 've ever wanted anything  --  I want to lead a normal life with you . " She lay there with one arm around him as they slept . It was uncomfortable , but he did not shake it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came down to drink more white sherry under the red-and-white parasols of the Bullfighters ' Club . But it was not the sherry or the bullfighters that held Flick and Tony for three days around Pampeluna 's yellow square . It was Jesu Christi Basiano . " Jesus is an artist , " Lynd told Felicity . " But his snows are green , his trees always painted red  --  and God knows what you will think of his skies . Nevertheless , he 's a damned nice Spaniard . " He was very much flattered when , on the first afternoon after their arrival at Pampeluna , as they were having coffee outside the Cafe Suiza among clicking dominoes and waiters with pots of goat 's milk , a Baby Peugot pulled up and Jesus leapt out . " Jesus rode with me into the Pyrenees four years ago . . did n't you , Jesus ? " said Tony , introducing them . Jesus , who could only understand the words Jesus and Pyrenees , nodded effusively : " Si , si , senor ! " " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " said Lynd . " Usually I say , si , si . . . and Jesus says , no , no . . . do n't you , Jesus ? " " No comprenddo , senor . " Although Jesus could understand nothing , he would not be left out of the conversation ; Tony had to try , at least , to explain everything . Any conversation between Tony and Flick therefore became impossible .  | Jesus , an egg-faced little Spaniard , with two black dots that nt for eyes , was staring anxiously from one to the other of m , for fear that he was being made fun of in some way . d reached out his hand and Jesus seized it . " My wife , " said Tony . " Senor ! . . . " Jesus leapt to his feet . He stood back . He threw out his arms . With both hands he seized Felicity 's and pressed it to his lips . " Ha-ha , senor ! " He pounded Lynd on to back . " Bueno , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ 's sake , " said Tony quickly as saw Flick 's lips begin to curl . " This man is a friend of ine . " With a picturesque melange of sign language , a few words f Spanish , and much serious gesticulation around the square , Jesus made it known that he had just heard Senor Lynd was In town , and that he had come at once . How long had Senor I.ynd come to stay ? And where was Senor Lynd going ? In his effort to protect Jesus from Flick 's hovering sneer , Tony hastily answered , " Ujue pueblo . " " Ah . . . ha ! . . . Senor , senor ! . . . " To his horror , Lynd realized that by this unguarded remark he had invited Jesus to go with them . Ujue , as Jesus himself had shown him four years before , was one of the last remaining bits of old Spain . It was a tiny village , a robbers ' roost , perched on the tip of a lonely spur of mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one place where , he hoped , the very romance of the scene would impress even a hard-boiled soul like Felicity with the wonder of their being together in Spain . He had counted a lot upon Ujue pueblo . And now Jesus had entered the scene . And , knowing Jesus , he did not see how it would be possible to drop him . So , for three days , he had plied Jesus with sherry in an attempt to knock him out . The result had been several bumpy rides in the Riley out into the countryside around Pampeluna where , knocking at a shabby door among the goats and chil-  | dren of some wretched village , Jesus would magically usher them into the palatial study of a Don . In this way , one afternoon , Tony and Flick spent a few unreal hours in the home of a great Spanish dramatic critic , preparing in the countryside his great work on the plays of Lope de Vega . On the next afternoon , in a village where they had the barricades up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the presence of the Royal Blood itself ; a listless Duke who was writing a history of the Carlist wars , all in long-hand , of which there was to be only one copy  --  each volume of which he bound in red morocco himself . The Duke produced his wife with the ceremony of introducing them into a sacred harem . They were charming people ; the Duke spoke the most exquisite English . . . but they would feed Felicity sweet sherry and plum jam . Lynd feared for Jesus . And Jesus , of course , now considered himself a member of the Lynd household . " Jesus knows everybody , " said Lynd despairingly . " Wish he did n't know us , " said Felicity . Tony had never imparted to Flick the intention of Jesus to go with them to Ujue . The dashes out into the country , therefore , had an irritating purposelessness in her mind . On this morning she had decided to put a stop to it all . " When , " she asked , " are we going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Tony . " At once . Now . Pronto . Let 's get our things down at once . " Since about eleven the previous night , when Lynd had driven Jesus to his little painted home over the meat market , Jesus had not been on the scene . Perhaps the white sherry had done its work . Now , with some luck , there was a good chance to escape from him . Flick was in a mood so savage , after the amount of white sherry which she insisted Tony made her drink , that she would not leave the table to pack her bags . It was accordingly the hour of siesta , that dependable hour when all good Spaniards should have been taking their noon-day doze , that Lynd brought the car around and began to stow their bags . Flick ,  | ' ter beautiful eyes very bloodshot , was finally persuaded to get Into it . It was then , as he was in the very act of turning out of that yellow square , that a figure leapt on the running-board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished and infuriated Tony Lynd , Jesus leapt into the air and came down on the moving car 's back seat . " Si , si , senor ! " cried Jesus , exulted by his feat  --  and waved for them to go ahead . " Ujue ! " he said . Flick leaned forward and turned off the switch . " Is this ghastly creature coming with us ? " " He is , " said Tony . " He is not ! " " Well , let 's see you try to get rid of him . " Tony , facing the Inevitable , looked at Felicity with a grin to see what she would do . He was not prepared for what she did . " Heah ! Heah ! " Felicity addressed Jesus with those scaring tones with which one tries to drive off a midnight cat . " Get out ! " She waved a hand at him . Jesus , who apparently thought this was some kind of English game , sat there and smiled . His seriousness , hard to bear even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just a red rag . Tony laughed . He felt sorry for Jesus ; but it was marvelous to see any mere man standing up to Felicity like that . He looked at Felicity . " You think this is funny ? " she said , and there was again that dangerous rising intonation in her voice . " Well . . . what do you think of that ? " She threw her bag and hit Jesus in the face . In his consternation Lynd was unable to do anything before it was too late . While he was still clutching Flick 's hand , Jesus leapt from the car . There was nothing sprightly , no gaiety in the bound with which he regained the street ; he was horribly mortified . He was holding his hand to his face . Staring , un-  | believingly , at Flick . The instant he saw Tony scrambling out of the car he took to his heels . Seeking sanctuary , Jesus headed for the nearest church . It was impossible to pursue him there , even for his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the feelings of the proud little Basque , if he were allowed to escape without having been forced to listen to the most humble apology , braved the church . In its dark , tranquil interior he saw a few women , in black , kneeling on little chairs they had reversed before the altar . A priest glowered at this sightseeing foreigner  --  always in a rush , these gaping strangers ? and vanished in a crypt . Somewhere , in the vast maze of yellow stone , Lynd heard chanting voices . But no Jesus . . . . When he came out into the hot sunlight , his squinting eyes focused themselves on Flick 's red mouth . A decisive moment , he realized , was at hand . Something that would have a vital effect on all the rest of his life . If he had any guts he would tell Felicity what he thought of her ; and he would break with her right where they were . " I wish you were a man ! " he growled ineffectively . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not . . . you 're a woman ... and that 's why you do such dirty things . You know you 're safe . Anyway , far as getting a punch in the jaw is concerned . " She was all smiles . Alluringly fresh in her spotted linen . And provocative as she could make herself . " Hop in , my sweet . I adore you . " " Oh , go to hell . " Nevertheless , he got in . As he shoved the car into gear and they turned slowly out of that yellow square , he looked back regretfully . " There goes a friend , " he said . " Poor Jesus . I 've got an idea you and I are going to leave a trail of my friends in our wake . " " He wo n't blame you , my darling . And he is such a little fool . " " Does n't matter . He 's wretched . I ca n't bear to think of  | him . . . standing that way . . . his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) uple of lice , we are . " " Absolutely , my darling . " There was something oddly proper about Flick . For all her boasted indifference as to whom she slept with  --  and Lynd wondered at times : was this so devastatingly important ? thinking , to cheer'himself up , of the great artists , actresses and women of the world who had had a panorama of affaires belure they married into the Peerage . Flick at times , he knew now , positively hungered for propriety . And simplicity . That night , at Ujue , he caught her darning socks . And very skillfully . He loved the sight of her little hands moving so quickly as she shoved the needle back and forth over the wooden egg . And she had grandly used up most of their small allowance of water to wash his handkerchiefs ( an unappetizing job , he thought , to do for any man ) . She had them pressed against the small window-pane . She had one beautiful bare leg thrown over her knee and was singing to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a rasp of regret . Blissfully contented . He moved towards her . Then , afraid that some chance remark or gesture would set her off again , he moved as unostentatiously as he could to the window . He leaned there , smoking , watching the lights go out in the little pueblos that hung like clusters of grapes on the mountain sides . He heard Flick say , " There ! " She had finished the socks and stood up , brushing the ends of wool from her . She came over and put her hand on his back , her mouth once more lifted up in that ironic grin of hers : " Well , my sweet ? " " Nothing , " he said . " I do love you , you wretch ! " s s s  | The next day she followed him like a poodle around Ujue . In that remote pueblo , perched on its solitary mountain tip , they felt they were both above and free from this world . There was no hotel , in this village of stone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets . They had put up with the same Spanish family which had housed him four years before on his lonely mule ride across Spain . When they entered its iron-studded door Tony showed Flick , with some fear that she would laugh , the same hot , smelly lower quarters where his two mules had slept ; the room directly below the one they were given . Nothing had changed in Ujue , not even the memory of his stay there . Old Jose and his wife received him like the Prodigal Son . They had been a little awed by Felicity at first . But this was where her easy manners came in . His first fears that she would hurt these people were unnecessary . She said she loved roast rabbit , and ate it uncomplainingly . Jose , taking heart , even insisted she drink the red wine out of the porrOn , squirting it into her open mouth , without touching it with her lips . Lynd saw that she ruined her spotted linen dress without even so much as a glance at it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sake . He was sure of it afterwards when he saw her trying to soak out the spots of wine with salt and hot water . She was more careful about her clothes than her morals , he thought . The priests , in the little fighting church whose tower crowned the mountain pueblo , awoke them at dawn with their chanting . Flick and he leaned out the window and watched the day strike Navarre . The pink tiles of Ujue 's roofs shoaled like scales into the pool of morning mist below them . Then the sun burned through and they looked down into the terraces of olives and plowed fields , the Spaniards and their cattle going out to the day 's work on the mountain slopes . They went down to breakfast and sat on stools around the little acacia fire while they ate a leathery sausage and migas , that peasant staple of bread shavings , garlic , and mutton fat . And Flick ate it .  | " Perhaps a little wine , " said Tony , understandingly , " would help to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might help . " They drove back to Pampeluna in a beatific mood . s s But it passed . Perhaps it was the white sherry . It might have been , Lynd was afraid , that Felicity felt she had been good long enough . It may have been his own inflamed jealousy when he was drinking . . . his thought that he would so soon 1w parted from her . . . that made him fling a lot of nasty remarks at her about her past life . They had the hell of a row . This was in the hotel of the bullfighters ' , their own room , to which Augusto had climbed so hopefully to invite them to his village . Augusto was the doyen of Tony 's Spanish friends . his village was in the high Pyrenees , high up at the head of the valley of Roncal where there is no pass into contaminating France . Augusto , who turned into a goat once he was in his beloved mountains , spent eight months of his year in Paris . ! There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made him look so much like a faun himself . Lynd and he had enjoyed each other 's companionship in both places . " Feelicity . . . " implored Augusto , when she began to weep with rage . " Vous etes tres ironique ! " " Let her be , " said Lynd . " Have another drink . " Augusto drank , pounded his knees , and tried to get a smile out of Felicity . She would n't leave Tony alone . " I 'm through , " she said . " All right ; you 're through . Come on , Augusto , have another drink . " He filled Augusto 's glass without offering any to Felicity . " Give me some of that . " He gave her a glass . " I 'm through . " " I know it . Say something new for a change . "  | " You . . . and your damn Spanish friends ! " " What have they done to you ? Merely tried to be nice to you. , , " You Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist ! I 'd like to see you get on in Spain the way that I do . I 'd . . . " It did seem damn foolish , what he was saying . " Oh , yes  --  When I get you to Ujue . . . " You should see Augusto 's village , my darling . . . ' You cheap edition of Ernest Hemingway ! " " Go on . Go to hell ; I told you to . You and your damn artist friends . . . fornicating each other around Spain . That 's the only kind of Spain you know . What the ceilings looked like ! " Felicity threw the sherry in Tony 's face . He jumped up , took her by the throat and shook her . " You talk that way to me , you little bitch . . . I 'll damn well kill you . " Augusto leapt to his feet . He sprang to them . He hovered . . . . His hands reached out to touch them . . . then they drew back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was silent . Just a few gurks inside her showing her fight to master herself . " Tony ? . . . Feelicity ? . . . " Augusto looked helplessly from one to the other . In his rage Lynd had flung Felicity back across the bed . She now wiped her eyes with the end of a sheet ; and , taking advantage of this momentary blindness , Augusto seized her hand and tried to force it into Tony 's . She scratched Augusto . " Leave her alone . To hell with all of it . Come on , Augusto , let 's you and I go downstairs and have another drink . " " No , Tony . . . . We must all be friends . " " To hell with you , then . No , sorry , Augusto  --  you must n't get in between us when we fight . You 'll lose an ear . You 'd better push off . Leave us alone to our sorrows . " " I wo n't ! I . . . Tony , amigo ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake . . . " Now Augusto was crying . He seized the bottle of sherry and spilled half a glass . Tony snatched it away from him . " I 'll ring  | another bottle , " said Augusto . Quickly , he pulled the bell When he walked into the office in London he thought that Marjory seemed a bit strange . She seemed to be avoiding him . Finally , as she was putting down some papers on his desk , she said awkwardly : " Miss Kyra Power has rung up . " " What did she want ? When did she call ? " " She just wanted to know where you were . " " I ) id she leave any address , any telephone number ? Where can I get hold of her ? " Marjory said she did n't know . Lynd had the impression she Was not telling the truth , but then it would be impossible to press her to answer . When she had gone back to the other room he dialed Kyra 's old number . The exchange girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was glad . Life had enough complications these days . And Kyra would meet more than her match in this situation ! The Spanish trip had left a bad taste in his mouth . If he and Flick were going to go on , it certainly could not be like this . A couple of Bloomsbury intellectuals , perhaps , going off on an affair , might have thought that they had grasped a lot of the " I 'm sorry , Augusto , you should see such a row . " " You damned prig ! " Oh , for God 's sake , Felicity , ca n't you forget that word ? " " No , I ca n't . " She was suddenly laughing . Augusto saw it ? seized her hand . He jerked Tony and shoved his hand in icily 's . He gave a great sob himself . Through a veil of tears k and Augusto smilingly watched the maid enter . " Jerez ! Jerez ! " cried Augusto . " My God ! " said Tony . " We ought to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . Maybe you 're right . Here , my sweet , have some this . Have a lot . Then we 'll all go across to the Cafe Suiza. "  | color of life out of their Spanish fandango . But he and Flick knew that it was headaches , a lot of drunken arguments that never led anywhere , and a lot of the real Spain , the color of its streams and mountains , that they had missed . He was , he knew , no longer an amigo at the Bullfighters ' Club  --  they had left a trail of wreckage even on those narrow little stairs . In the melancholic mornings  --  when neither of them had felt kind enough to admit this  --  they had simply continued the fight . But now the time had come for him and Flick to call a truce , to face the fact that their feelings towards each other were too intense to be continued as an affair of any sort . They would either be the making or the breaking of each other . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a great many of his friends leading very irregular lives . In fact , of the early crowd that Chris and he had first come into when he entered journalism , there was hardly a pair at this day which remained together . They had , in various degrees , drifted apart from each other . Either it was open , cynical , cold-blooded divorce , or one side or the other was stomaching the fact that the other person had another lover . The lives of foreign journalists seemed to lead to this , the unorthodox way they trooped around the world , the opportunities that were offered to them , the betrayals of all standards of life that they saw every day all around them . They had to report too much daily treachery to have much faith any longer in man 's ideals . They soon acquired the Bohemian 's contempt for any of the irksome obligations of conventional married life . They were artists , in their way . The love between him and Flick , he thought savagely , was a great deal more beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of half a dozen of his divorced friends . The very people who , he knew , were every day criticizing his conduct , and very likely to Christina . He was furious with them for that , for these things never matter until they strike home ; and by their complacent sympathy and advice they were making Christina suffer for the very things they had done themselves . He had  | often tried to point this out to her , and without success . He could understand that ; she felt too deeply about it . And he Idid n't blame her . On the other hand , it was essential that he Mw clearly this example of his kind friends , before he took to t ; sadistic contemplation of himself . " The trouble with me is , " he said to himself , " I 'm chickenbearted . I 'm too fond of Chris to leave her , and I 'm too addicted to Flick to let her go . As a result I am being called a perfect monster all around London . " I t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that he could do about it ? He was disgusted with the easy advice that one of his best friends voluntarily offered him : " I would n't stand it for five minutes , Tony . A man 's got to live . And he lives in his pants , you know . " ' Pony shuddered . " My God , " he said , " do you mean to say you can treat a woman like that  --  a girl who 's been decent to you for over ten years . You 're crazy ! A thing like this is a hell of a problem to answer ! " And so it went . More and more of his friends , Tony knew , Were coming to Christina with their solicitations . Not that she invited them , or even let them talk . And more and more the nger flamed within him at this unjust estimate all these people Were making so glibly of his life . To hell with all of them beCame almost his daily slogan . He began to shun some of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of values , he suspected : " You were wrong to be so faithful for such a long time to Christina . It is your fault that she expects such dog-like faithfulness . You are the person who is really to blame . Not she . " But then , when he admitted sourly one night that perhaps he had been foolish to have been so true to Christina , it was Flick who murmured : " Oh , why ? . . . " As if she herself , behind the facade , appreciated such a love .  | It was because he knew that both he and Flick valued just this straightforward faithfulness , that he was so furious with outward criticism . They were n't rotten in their own hearts , no matter what anybody might care to think . They did not know what was going to happen . But the one effect of all this criticism , simply because of its injustice , was that it drew them together in a common self-defense . Senator Hancock came to town . One morning when Tony was dejectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the office . Lynd was surprised to see him up so early and looking so fit . " Love , " said Senator Hancock , when Lynd mentioned this . " That 's what makes the world go round . Miss Svenson and I flew over yesterday in the Paris ' plane . Here , get Marjory to see about our mountain of trunks , will yer  --  they 're coming by boat . We 've been shopping . Tony , I 'm enjoying life ! " " How the devil do you manage to keep away so long from the Senate ? " asked Lynd . " Makes no difference . I 've got all the money I want . Only wanted to be a Senator  --  once . Y'know ; just to show I could do it . Matter fact , I 've been doing a little political work on the side  --  gon na go back an ' tell ' em all what the hell 's the matter with Yurrup . Trouble with these Englishmen is  --  they wo n't work . " " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dock , " asked Ly ' 1d , " when you ca n't find somebody to buy them ? " " When I was in Rome , " said the Senator , " I would n't even speak to Mussolini . " Lynd escaped from answering that by looking at the pile of letters on his desk . " Say , Tony , " said Mr. Hancock , " I 'd sure like to have my little girl meet your missis ? "  | " Oh  --  all right . What about tomorrow night ? Have dinner st our house . " Tony thought . " And look here , if you 're investlgating politics  --  how would you like to meet a real Bolshie ? " Phis new Russian secretary , anxious to know about bour'cois life , was now about to learn something . " Say , that 'd be swell . I 'd like to talk to one of those guys . " " Okay , " said Lynd . When the Senator went out he called up Christina , explained what was up , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Embassy was free r tomorrow night . " I say , Mr. Lynd ! " said Marjory , " you are a one . Coo ! ink of puttin ' those two men together . " s s s The Lynds were very proud of their drawing-room in l'heyne Walk . Christina had brought back some pussy willows from the country , and a bough of young green leaves . Their reflections shimmered in the light of the dancing fire as they stood in a glass battery-jar against the wall . Senator Hancock , In a dinner jacket with sparkling diamond shirt studs , leaned against the Adam fireplace . He spoke through his cigar : " Why , I 've got a wine cellar in my house that 's twice the size of this  --  and it 's full from top to bottom ! Lemme tell you about that house , Mrs. Lynd . " Christina came down with Miss Salome Svenson at the same time that the maid announced dinner . Miss Svenson was a beautiful greyhound Dane , with ropes of plaited blonde hair twisted around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches taller than the Senator . " Lemme tell you about that house , " insisted Mr. Hancock as they sat down at the long , polished refectory table . " Y'oughter see that house ! Is n't another like it in the whole wide world . Nossir . I got one of the finest architects in New York  --  and I says to him : I 'm gon na send you to Yurrup . I do n't want you to feel hampered . I want the best of everything  | that is . What you see in Tudor  --  well , I want you to pick the best that you can get out of all that . What you see in the Elizabeth period  --  take that . Go to Italy and see what the old Greeks did . And then I want you to go to Egypt . . . some of those baths like Cleopatra had . Copy them to a dot . When you 're going through France  --  stop on your way , make some good drawings of those chatoos on the Loire . Those turrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer  --  so I told him he need n't bother about wasting time there . And then , ' I says to him , come back and build me that house  --  expense is no ob-ject  --  y'unnerstan ' ? ' " Well , " said Mr. Hancock , tucking his napkin in his shirt front ? " y'ought to see that house . " " I 'd love to , " said Christina . " It must be amazing . " " I 'll say so . Why , I got pheasants on my place  --  I let my chauffeurs shoot ' em . " Miss Salome Svenson did not say very much , except to answer " Yes " or " No " or " I guess that 's okay ! " And for some reason , Christina who could be relied on to make an immense success of any such occasion , seemed strangely preoccupied . When the women had gone , Lynd left the Russian and the American Senator together while he went down into the cellar for another bottle of brandy . He could see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mr. Hancock . When he returned he found the dark-browed secretary backed into a corner , with the Senator tapping him on the chest . " The trouble with you Russians is , " said the Senator ? giving another jab ? " is you ai n't got no culture . Y'unnerstan ' what I mean  --  no culture . . . " The scowling Russian , who had marched a division from Nijni Novgorod to half-way across Siberia in the Red and White Russian wars , who had sat on the ice outside a besieged city of Whites  --  and captured it by sending skillful propagandists into the town , so that it fell from within  --  held his  | tongue although the veins on his flushed forehead were standing out like thick cords . Almost immediately after they rejoined the ladies he announced that he was sorry , but he had to get back to the Embassy for some special work . As Lynd was helping him on with his coat at the door , the big Russian hissed : " Lynd  --  how could you work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Lynd . " Maybe I wo n't be much longer . I 've got a hunch that lightning 's about to strike . I do n't know from where . " " Well , when the Embassy car comes , " said the Russian ? " I 've ordered it for eleven o'clock , will you tell the driver I 've gone ? " When they had all gone , Christina , very pale , sank back on the couch beside the fire . " Peter , " she said desperately , " you 've been in Spain with Felicity Tyrell ? " Lynd bit his lip . " Yes , " he said . " Oh , Peter ! " " I 'm sorry . . . I 'm sorry .... How did you find out ? " " Kyra told us . " " Kyra ? " He jumped to his feet . " How in God 's ? " " She came over to Mother 's this afternoon . And , oh , Peter , she said such beastly , beastly things " Lynd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well ... let 's have it , " he said . Christina , of course , knew the Russian story of Kyra  --  but not the London side . She did not even know that Tony and Kyra had ever met again . Not until now . " I have n't seen Kyra for months , " he said . " I know it . Oh , Tony , Tony . . . you must forgive me . . . but you do n't know what a ridiculous position you 've placed  | me in . That one of your mistresses should come to me and complain about another mistress . . . . " " But she came to your mother 's ? " " Yes , but she came here first , for me . . . and when Gudrun said I was over at Mother 's she came over there . Oh , Tony  --  it was horrible . . . . " " Well , how did she find out ? " " Marjory told her . " " Now that 's a lie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be skinned alive . There 's something wrong here . " " There 's lots wrong , Peter . But apparently she had been trying to get hold of you for days . She rang up Marjory and she told Kyra you were in Spain . How she found out about you and that other beastly woman , I do n't know . But she called up Felicity Tyrell 's office and found she was also in Spain . Then she rang up Marjory and told her the whole thing . " " Spain 's a big country . " " But it 's all true , is n't it ? " " Yes . " " Well , what do you want me to do ? I 'm all at sea . I still do n't know what to think about anything . I 've believed you so implicitly all along . I knew about Flick of course . But I had begun to see that I had been a little hard-hearted and ununderstanding about certain things . I 've often felt sorry for you . I feel sorry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen you looking wretched I was on the point of saying why did n't you have a mistress . But , Peter , Peter . . . you could n't be faithful  --  even to Kyra ! " Lynd felt his brain escaping him . Talk about emotional Russians ! He gripped his head . He had all he could do to repress an unholy desire to laugh . " It 's monstrous ! " said Christina . " Why , you could n't even be faithful to the girl you were once in love with ! " " Of all the nonsense I 've ever heard in my life , " he said ? " tonight I 've heard some of it . Not from you . But just this  | unbelievable situation . Now , Christina , do just listen to mee .... " As accurately as he could he gave a complete , unsparing bh tory of the whole situation . How he had been secretly liv$ng with Kyra for some time , been quite happy  --  that physical need of his life had been satisfied , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doing it . " You 've seen Kyra , " he said . " You know what she 's like  --  there 's no evil there . None . " He explained the fantastic way that he and Kyra had parted . He explained the mood he was in when he met Flick . " And with Felicity , " he said , " I know I am hurting you . You 're quite right there , this is something different . But I ca n't understand why Kyra should have made such a scene . If she had n't been such a bloody little fool I would have been with her still . And , as a matter of fact , I did have one short break with Felicity . . . . " In a rush to purify himself by making a complete confession , he even told Christina about his stormy scene with Felicity in this very room . He felt reckless tonight  --  or was it hope ? At any rate , it was a relief to sweep away the false scenery of this double life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish to him as he said it ; but before he was through 1w had told her all there was to tell . His own intimate story , he did not stress . The physical starvation that had driven him to do these things , he did not talk about . It was the one thing that really counted . Yet he could not bring himself , even now , to fling that in Christina 's face . She had enough to bear . She had touched on it tonight , theoretically , about her acquiescence to his having a mistress . But the mere cold fact itself  --  Spain with Felicity Tyrell  --  had already crumpled Christina up . It was odd , but even in that agitated afternoon , Chris had seen enough of Kyra not to regard her as a danger to their household . And with unerring instinct , she knew that Flick was . Therefore , this talk tonight must be solely on the basis that he was someone who had done all the wrong .  | ' Phis of course put him in an entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not appreciate the way it mastered other people 's lives  --  and his efforts to defend himself under the circumstances made him appear guiltier than ever . It placed upon him the full stigma of being sordid and shallow . " You seem actually to be proud of it ! " Christina declared . " Oh , no , for heaven 's sake , do listen to what I am trying to say . I know I 've done wrong ; I know that it is probably wrong for me to look at any other woman than you . I 'm not going to try and exonerate myself by pointing out the number of our friends who are no better than I am  --  or the ones who callously take it to the divorce courts . You do know the feeling I have in my heart for you . And for your own sake I do want to point out to you that we are not the only two people whose lives get a little complicated at times . " " A little complicated ! . . . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk such rot . " " Well , there it is , " he said . s s s Christina dragged herself up to bed . He went into the other room and fetched the decanter . He knew that smothering cottonwool of sympathy Lady Mallard had tried to wrap her wounded daughter in that afternoon . He knew what Lady Mallard would say to him ; look pained  --  and say that he must be prepared to make the great sacrifice . Lady Mallard was a Theosophist ! Sometimes , he wondered if these respectable people were really flesh and blood . And what on earth had possessed Lyra to come to Christina ? When he tiptoed upstairs after the decanter was empty , he saw that Christina had taken the dachshund to bed . Zeppelin 's long brown nose and flapping ear lay on the pillow beside her .  | O N THE night of June 5th , that year , an earthquake struck England . Lynd and Christina were sleeping in an old four-poster bed down at " Jacobs , " the old Elizabethan house of some cousins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first that was recorded for over one hundred years . When Lynd and Christina felt the bed swaying under them , they sat up . In the dim glow of the dying wood fire in their room , Lynd saw a picture opposite him swing like a pendulum on the wall . " Did you see that ? " he asked Christina . " I did . " " Well , that 's good . If I 'd been here alone I would have said it 's high time for me to stop drinking . " " You can do that , too , Peter , " sighed Christina , and , turning over , immediately went to sleep . Other guests over the week-end at Jacobs had had similar eerie experiences . All were afraid to speak about it at breakfast the next morning , until the Sunday Observer came . And there it was : EARTHQUAKE TREMORS BRITAIN It was a ten day sensation . But that day another quake was to shake Britain ; and it was to go on shaking those islands for years and years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received by Ramsay MacDonald at a railway station , named of all places , Waterloo . It was Bruening , the German Chancellor , whispering in MacDonald 's ear : " Germany can not pay . " Words so soon to be changed to : " GERMANY WILL NOT PAY ! " A month before that the Credit-Anstalt in Vienna called to France and asked for the big promised loan which would save it from bankruptcy . The French replied the Credit-Anstalt  | could not have the money  --  unless Austria publicly renounced the proposed Austro-German Customs Pact . Sir Arthur Kindersley , of the Bank of England , rushed into the breach , and tried to save the Credit-Anstalt , Austria , Europe  --  with ? S , 000,000 . It was too late . On May 13th , the Credit-Anstalt closed its doors . A crack started in the financial-facade of Europe ; in a few days it was a crevasse . The world 's economic blizzard had begun . In the next months Tony and his colleagues underwent a journalistic embarrassment of riches . Early familiarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helm , " as the expression was , of the world 's affairs had long ago imbued them with an angry skepticism concerning the capabilities , intentions , as well as the political morals of the men in high places . But even that wavering of cynicism had not prepared them for this . In the rout that followed the collapse of the Credit-Anstalt they saw Britain 's greatest economists publicly denounce each other as incompetents in the frantic suggestions that they were individually putting forth to salve the financial crisis and to save  --  or do away with  --  the gold standard . " Good Lord , " said Tony , with great glee , to their luncheon table in Soho , " this is all duck soup to me ! I always suspected in college that the hackneyed phrases of Labor and Capital , demand and supply , and so forth  --  you remember the catchwords our professors used to flunk us on at our examinations ? . . . I always felt in my heart of hearts that that was all sheer bunk . . . and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the meaning of the catchwords they were flunking us on . They do n't know today ! It 's a perfectly gorgeous retribution . " London ! citadel of the world 's finance , center of the world 's foreign exchange transactions , " Guardian of the world 's financial honor ! " ? as Ramsay MacDonald was orating , when he was speechifying why England would never leave the gold standard , and disinherit her creditors  --  mighty and omniscient London City was caught out on the worst loan racket of modern history . Her bankers , who had been borrowing short on  | bow terms of interest and lending long on high , found that they had four hundred and fifty million pounds of obligations to nu ( t  --  and only two hundred and fifty million to meet them with . Their excuse for the vast sums that they now discovered were frozen in Germany , and could not be retrieved to repay their other borrowing , was  --  of all things ! ? that they had not known collectively what each London banker was loaning individually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried the little Galician stockbroker at the Soho gathering ? " but it is true . I should have laughed if you had told me last week  --  but now , I shake your hand , if you say the Bank of England is not the Rock of Gibraltar any more . The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is a whore ! " " She 's worse , " laughed Tony one day , after being closeted for hours at a time with the secret delegates Hoover had hastily dispatched to Europe over his ill-fated Moratorium : " Do you know that the entire gold reserve of the Bank of England is pledged against the eighty and fifty million pound loans the British have got from the French and the Americans in their crazy effort to save the British pound from going off the gold standard , and that , as we sit here today  --  there is not one penny of gold behind the British currency ? Not a damn cent ! " At that table , talk now became so tense that it often threatened to break up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominant Francophile section of the British Foreign Office were fools to let clever French statesmen lead them along by the nose to support the futile French attempt to keep Germany a second-rate Power in Europe , the French journalist got up and left the table . " I wo n't stand such talk , " said he . " I 'm sorry , " said Tony . " But sit down , and tell us just how you are going to keep sixty million lusty Germans down  --  unless someone helps you . " The cynical French delay in accepting the Hoover Moratorium , a financial peace overture which at that time might  | have stayed the financial crisis a bit , caused two weeks ' bitter wrangling at that table . Henty , the London left-wing journalist , who had criticized Tony for his interpretative dispatches supporting British policy on the India question , came into his own in days of debacle , and guyed the French correspondent unmercifully for his country 's narrow diehardism . " It 's you , the damn French , " he said frankly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe or recovering from the world slump . You 're the old kill-joys . You started this racket when you refused to come through with the promised loan you were offering to save the Credit-Anstalt ? unless the Austrians dropped the Austro-German Customs Pact . You killed the Hoover war debt Moratorium by the way you stalled around before accepting it . . . snooping around to see if your fears were right , that it might in some way bring back the breath of life to suffering Germany . You 've just killed the Danubian conference because your nasty , mean-hearted little Prime Minister rushed across and saw our Boob-in-Office , and made Ramsay accept , before the conference , six of your cynical seven points  --  so that now the chance of giving any economic respite to the Central European States is gone . They 'll have to trust to Mother France now  --  heh ? And for what ? " Henty laughed derisively : " You French ! My God  --  did n't you know you lost your last chance to make peace in Europe in 1923 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German ledgers with bayonets , as Lloyd George put it . Well , you 've borne the Revenger . . . if it is n't Hitler , then it 's going to be some other German who will turn and fall upon you . . . . I learned a lot about German resentment and intentions in the Ruhr . . . . " Even the doughty little French correspondent fell silent at that . For it was known to all at the table that during the time Dick Henty had been writing from the Ruhr , hiding in a cellar with telephonic connections with Berlin , the French had put  | a price on his head . And it was tacitly admitted that the reward would be paid whether Richard Henty were alive or ( lead . The dismaying bewilderment of every statesman in office during the early months of the slump incited responsible journalists to a keener interest than ever in their reporting . The crisis had produced an international melee in which all forms of voices , unofficial and unorthodox , were shouting . Tony 's outer office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crank , " with his own solution of the financial problem that he wanted to see in print . After a long study of the MacMillan report and a careful survey of Britain 's foreign investments , Lynd came to the conclusion early in July that for the first time within modern memory Great Britain was going to finish the year in the red  --  have a debit in her balance of international payments . " Well , this one ought to make them sit up ! " he exclaimed to Christina one morning . It was his custom to read two leading and opposite London journals while he drank his coffee in bed , and then begin his telephone calls which exchanged opinions with the Pole and other correspondents he was working with , during which they planned each day 's work . " Here 's an item in the financial columns of the Times . . . diminished returns from the Argentine . . . which gives me just the peg I want to hang my story on . I 've been collecting information for this for weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This story today will cause a sensation in New York ! " But not a ripple was stirred . His barometer on these occasions was usually one of the London offices of the big American Press agencies . These always overworked men , almost distracted by reporting the firecracker explosions of Europe 's calamities and minor crises every day now , were too pressed by the exigencies of split-second news flashing to have time for the long distance , interpretative stories . These men were his friends ; they would beat him to any story they could , and  | usually did ; but every so often he would touch off one of these long distance bombs  --  and they would get frantic cables from New York : WHERE WERE WE ON THIS Pippet , head of the biggest agency , grinned when Lynd came to him . " Not a word , old soak . Guess they threw yours in the wastepaper basket . What were the gory details , any-way ? " " Go to hell , " laughed Tony . When that day 's paper came from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used , he went along to the American Ambassador . That distinguished diplomat spat twice , expertly , and hit the same pattern on the carpet of 4 Grosvenor Gardens ; then he said : " Look here , Mr. Lynd  --  I do n't blame you for writing that sort of stuff . " He tapped the stem of his famous pipe against Lynd 's copy of his cable , lying on the official desk . " But I do n't blame the American papers for not printing it . Your paper was right not to send that out to its syndicate . " " Why ? It 's the truth  --  have n't I proved that ? " " Ummmm . . . Well , you 've no business writing that sort of stuff . . . not at times like these . England will pull through . " " Very likely , " said Tony , holding on to himself . " But you 're thinking of London , and comfortable io Downing Street . I 'm thinking of the Rhondda Valley in Wales . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands in their pockets . . . of the dead textile towns in the Midlands . . . the ship-yards where you wo n't hear a solitary riveter working now-a-days . . . . Just about one man out of every five potential working men in this country is without a job . It would be a damn good thing if some of the American delegates to these cock-eyed conferences left their swell hotels in London and went up to Manchester for a few days . . . or Ashton-under-Lyne . . . . Then they would lose some of their idiotic criminal optimism . . . . "  | The American Ambassador was the type of man before whom a journalist , if the diplomat had any respect for him , could speak his mind . Journalists knew him as an intensely practical , hard-boiled gentleman , not overgiven to soft-soaping the British . He nodded now at Lynd 's picture of the stricken Midlands , and Britain 's four major industries . " Go on and write it , " he said . " But remember one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too damn many good reasons for panic these days . " " No , " said Lynd . " And I agree with you . I do n't believe that the British are going to muddle through , ' either  --  I 've got too much healthy respect for this country 's genius for compromise . . . . I think they are going to think their way out of it . But that 's got nothing to do with my story that the British are in the hole . . . that they are a long way into the red , right now ! " The Ambassador hit another rose on the carpet 's design . " My sneaking opinion is that you 're right , " he said . " Officially , I am making investigations into the matter . . . . " He gave Tony a quick smile and picked up some correspondence on his desk to indicate that the interview was ended . That evening , when Tony came home , he said to Christina : " Look here , my love , you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " At dinner , he explained : " It wo n't be much fun . We 'll have to put up at Pontypridd . . . and the scenes you 'll see will fair break your heart . But I 've been talking with the Ambassador this morning . . . . I think the conditions in the Welsh valleys need an airing just now . . . in the American newspapers . A few cold realistic stories to let the ordinary American know  --  and feel ! ? just what it is like to live on the dole . ' There 's a spate of damn ' diehard propaganda , not only in this country , but over in the States , about the joys of life on the un-  | employment insurance pay . The American end has a very dirty purpose to it . The Republicans and the American bankers are in a state of jitters that something like the British unemployment insurance scheme will have to be introduced into the United States . They are afraid they will face something very like a revolution , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discredit the dole ' system in England . The chief point that the American bankers are making , while they are holding out on making another loan to the British to save the pound , is that this maudlin British Labor Government must cut the dole . ' . . . Superficially this dirty mean measure will show England 's good-will and serious intention to put her house in economic order . . . . Fundamentally , it will give the American diehards all the ammunition they want to say : See . . . even the British had to cut their own dole . ' . . . It does n't work , you see ! " " Why , good heavens ! " said the overjoyed Christina ; " that is just the one kind of story that I would love to work with you on ! When do we start ? " " Tomorrow , " said Tony . " I 'll get the car greased and in order tonight . Pack the bags . . . we 'll go over to the coast and get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show Zeppelin some holes in the ground bigger than even she can dig . " The morning they woke up in Pontypridd , Tony asked Christina to look out their window . The street curb was lined with men , all standing with their hands in their pockets . They looked as if they were waiting for a procession of some sort to come along . " Miners ? " said Tony , " at least , they were , or might have been . But not a man there who 's over forty will ever go down a mine shaft again . Know what they 're waiting for ? The Old Age pension to come along . " Along the curb were some wooden barrows . A few Welsh housewives , with baskets on their arms , were carefully bargaining for pieces of meat and bits of fish that even from the hotel window looked in an almost uneatable state .  | " Miners ' wives , " said Tony , " buying their Lucullian dinner on the dole . ' Today , my sweet , you and I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so of uncomfortableness in the shops . The butcher looked ashamed of his meats ; and one automatically apologized : " Inteet to goodness , Madam , it 's not even Argentine . This is scraps . " He explained that what the Welsh miners were eating was meat that they would not have considered fit for their whippets in the good old days . Christina saw what Tony could n't see , the tawdry quality of all the clothes in the stricken shops . He saw her , with a look of poignant regret in her eyes , holding up some of the tiny woolen substitutes meant for children . " It 's ghastly ! " she said in almost a whisper . For two days they drove around with an insurance agent whom Tony was lucky enough to encounter in the bar . The man was collecting three pence a week from the miners ' families for their burial expenses . " So that they can have a decent funeral , " he said . " You would n't think , would you , in times like these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will put aside the money to bury them  --  when they have n't got enough to eat ! Look you . . . did you notice the way all the brasses were polished , and how they had blackened their hearths ? That is decent , is n't it ? " " Decent ! " Christina made no attempt to dab away the tears that filled her eyes . " I have never seen anything so heroic in my life . That last house we were in . . . that woman was only too right when she called her husband a hero . " In that tiny dwelling , with the invariable aspidistra placed in its closed parlor window , they had found a Welsh woman in the very act of polishing the brasses of her kitchen fire . She brushed aside a wisp of black hair from her brow and said to them defiantly : " My man 's a hero , he is . He wo n't have the dole . He happens to know a foreman over in the other valley . He 's got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | Without realizing its drama she drew them to the window and pointed to the bleak , scarred hillside behind her house . " Every morning , " she said proudly , " my man climbs the mountain . He has to start before it is light , and he never gets home until it is dark . In the winter , when there is ice on it , he climbs up that mountain on his hands and knees . . . . " They drove along streams that ran black as ink with the mines ' refuse , where gaunt piles at the pit-heads reared against the empty sky , where trees and vegetation itself had died in despair over so much ugliness . The children were playing tops , but in Tonypandy , Tony pointed out that not a single wheel was turning . " When I was here in 1926 , " he reminded Christina , " when I went with these Welsh miners through the whole General Strike , Tonypandy was a perfect furnace of Communism . There was another mining town above here they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an ism ' left in any of them . Did you ever look upon such a scene of silent despair ? " Christina shook her head : " That 's what you should call your articles , " she said ? " The Valley of Despair ! ' " That night , when they returned to their hotel , a young miner was waiting for Tony , and begged him to think if there was not some way he could suggest of helping the young miner find a job in London . " I 've been up twice , " he exclaimed . " Walked there . Last time I got a job . . . but I could n't make enough money on it to bring my wife there . We 're trapped , I tell you . We ca n't get out of this valley . I 've got two kiddies . My God , man . looked at Chris and hoped she had not heard the last question . Then , in a low voice , he said , " My dear fellow , I wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't think of anything . I just ca n't . Wo n't you have a drink with us ? " The dark-browed Welshman nodded and sat down at the table where Chris was waiting . " I 'm not used to this , " he said  | with a shy smile when Tony put the tot of whisky down before him . " It will make me drunk , if I take much of it . " He began on Christina , his sorrowful lament about his children 's future . Was n't there anything that she could suggest ? He declared that one of the reasons why so many of the miners never went home during the day and " just stand around with our hands in our pockets , " was because they were afraid that if they did go home they would eat all the food in the house . With pencil and paper he and Chris took the " dole " ? and then tried to figure out how his family could live on it . More than Tony , Christina saw the stark desperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his polite good-by , Tony went to the bar and brought back a double whisky for himself . " I feel like getting damn good and drunk tonight ! " he growled . " Peter . . . I do n't blame you , " said Christina . " I 'd like something to drown my own imagination . It makes me furious . Wild ! " " Now . . . you see why I hate them so ? These damned lousy politicians . . . all over the world . I wanted us to come down here and see this scene once again . . . because Ramsay MacDonald &; Co. are going to cut the dole . ' That 's what they 're headed for . . . in England , it is always the poor who are hit first . " And in my own damned country , " he growled , staring at his empty glass , " if the rich and the damned politicians do n't lay off all this bunk about rugged individualism ' ? and give the poor rugged individual something to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are going to get it in the neck . You can understand now . . . how I feel . . . when I have to listen to one of our ambassadors at large ' . . . shooting off his face in a Park Lane hotel . . . . " " It makes you want to kill them ! " said Christina.  | The Labor Cabinet did cut the " dole . " Lynd stood with the crowd of amazed journalists in the street between the genteel door of io Downing Street and the gloomy facade of the British Foreign Office while they waited for the Cabinet wrangle to end . The Americans wanted the British to cut it by twenty per cent , a thing that meant practical starvation , instead of mere undernourishment , to its hundreds of thousands of unemployed recipients . The British Cabinet persists in the genteel subterfuge that no vote is ever taken on a question ; decisions are merely reached by " an expression of opinion . " Tony learned from a faithful Labor member of that Cabinet how the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of bitter argument that were to split the British Labor Party and drive it into the wilderness , a representative of the British Conservatives and a representative of the almost defunct Liberal party sat in a middle room in Downing Street , waiting for the cut to be announced  --  how a representative of the Bank of England sat in another room , with his hand ready to pick up the Trans-Atlantic telephone and call the United States . Finally , " an expression of opinion " decided that the dole should be cut by ten per cent . Ramsay MacDonald arose and said he would take this decision into the next room to put it before the representatives of the two other British political parties : " Is that enough ? " he was alleged to have asked . " Wait a second , " they were supposed to have replied . " We have to ask them . " They went into the final room and told the Bank of England man that the Cabinet had decided to cut the dole by ten per cent . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , " he replied ? " We must ask them . " He , according to the account given Lynd by this loyal Labor minister on the scene , picked up the telephone and asked for Governor Harrison of the New York Federal Reserve Bank . " Is ten per cent enough ? " he asked .  | He was asked to wait a minute  --  until the Governor consulted Washington . s s s It was only later  --  in answer to an unexpected question in Parliament  --  that MacDonald admitted inadvertently that the unemployment cuts had been dictated to him by the bankers . This eye-witness account of the double-crossing drama in io Downing Street that Lynd cabled his Washington paper did not see the light of the newsstands . To Patrick Byron , whom he found in a suicidal mood in the Cafe Royal that night , Tony expressed the philosophical way he had now taught himself to receive cuts in his cabled dispatches . Showing Pat the truncated dispatch as it appeared , he smiled : " So , you see , some of me lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Patrick the final passionate disclosure made by the distressed loyal Labor minister : " Brother . . . when Ramsay went to the Palace that night to see the King . . . Arthur ( Arthur Henderson ) and I thought he was coming back to go out with us . . . to go out into the wilderness and reform the Labor Party to make another struggle to hold office . . . instead he came back leading this so-called National Government ! Ramsay and Snowden have sold the pass . . . . " Lynd made a hasty and unorthodox trip up to Lossiemouth to see MacDonald at the " Hillocks , " and forced that rhetorical Scot to admit that the ten per cent cut in the dole only meant a saving of twelve and one-half million pounds  --  a mere drop in the bucket in the astronomical figures of Britain 's expenditures . . . that , as an authentic economy , it did not mean anything . Why , he asked with apparent carelessness , had MacDonald then agreed to this paltry cut which meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Labor Party in office . " Because that expansion had to stop , " said MacDonald testily . " The Social Services , you mean ? " " Yes . " When Tony returned to London he gave this story to Patrick Byron to use in his Liberal newspaper . " Here 's a sensation for you , " he said ; " right on the eve of the November elections ! " But Patrick would n't use it . He shook his head . " My paper 's just a gang of damned , thrifty sentimentalists , when it comes to the showdown . They 'd never print that . The lousy bastards . . . they only talk Liberalism as a theoretical classroom subject . . . . You watch them run for cover when it begins to rain ! Anyway , Liberalism is dead . I 've decided to quit . " Booboo , it seemed , had done the unthinkable and suddenly gone off on a trip to South Africa on her own . Not , as before , to allow Patrick the free run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . To Patrick , this was the sign that his wife was leaving him for good , and all the world looked distasteful . When , for weeks , Tony tried to get his paper to print his predictions that England was going to leave gold  --  only to receive a couple of admonishing cables from his new boss as a consequence  --  he gave the information he had been collecting to the luncheon table in Soho . He described a conversation he had just had with a prominent London stockbroker , who said : " Tony , my lad , I do n't know whether it will be of any use to you . But we just had orders today to sell large blocks of British securities . . . and the order came from someone who was in a position to know what England was going to do about the Gold Standard . I would n't tell you this . . . if it did n't make me furious to see an Englishman doing a thing like that . I 'm buying dollars to protect my own position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " quickly asked the little Galician . " Last night , " said Tony , " at dinner . He was explaining why he would not take any time off for shooting this season . To my mind , if you knew this fellow , you would say that 's a pretty significant sign . I 've acted . I 've sold my wife 's war loan , which is all our life savings , and bought dollars . I 've also wired my paper that if they do n't want to print it , they can at least place on record my own personal opinion that within a week England will be off gold . " The table looked solemn . " A bit unpatriotic , is n't it , " put forth the upright Henty . " You live in this country , you know . Why desert the sinking ship ? " Tony nodded . " I quite agree with you . When I spoke to my wife she wanted to let it ride . . . our few thousands , with the British pound . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this big chap who sold his British securities ? . . . He stepped out . Did n't he ? It is only the little fellows who will be left holding the bag . This is the first time in my entire career in journalism that I have used any advance information , or even a hunch , if you want to call this that , to make money . This time , I 'm only saving it , as it happens . There 's a lot of personal anger in it , too . It infuriates me to hear Ramsay going on to make speech after speech about England being the guardian of the world 's financial honor  --  when they know they 're going off gold . You ca n't feel any altruistic patriotism . . . not when you know things like that . " This was at a Thursday luncheon . On Monday , Tony found his hand clenched by the little Galician . " Thank you , thank you , " he almost sobbed . " My friends would n't take my advice . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't done what you said . " " Oh , that . " Tony felt embarrassed by this gratitude . He had been down himself in Throgmorton Street that morning , and had just written a lengthy dispatch about the admirable  | way the sturdy British had taken this momentous jump from gold . No panic , no wild rush to buy commodities , no lascivious eagerness apparent on the part of these average Englishmen to see how they could profit by it . In times of stress , he once again felt his amazing admiration for the way these people could face disaster . He apologized to the Galician . " It 's funny , " he soliloquized . " We always speak of England in terms of its politicians . It 's a Labor Government in power , or a Conservative gang . . . but , sitting up here in the West End , and hanging around Whitehall . . . we almost forget the stubborn , steady British businessman . Politicians are charlatans and liars by trade . I guess they have to be . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that crowd in Throgmorton Street , and watched the conduct of those ordinary Englishmen who were left holding the bag . They are the real England . " During these months Flick was in Canada . Her father , with that astuteness that had enriched him enough to buy a British peerage ( an honor that was all arranged now ) , had had no qualms about deserting the sinking ship . He began to unload his British securities the day he read the advance proof of the May Report  --  that sinister document with which the artful Liberals and Conservatives hoped to break the Labor Government , but , instead , broke foreign confidence in the British pound sterling . The patriotic old financier was now over in Montreal protecting his Canadian investments from the world blizzard on that side of the Atlantic . Flick had gone with him . Her Australian papers no longer wanted any personality notes about British high life these days ; they saw more than enough prominent names in the casualty lists every morning of the financial crack-ups . It was the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an amused smile , how she would find the up-  | and-at-'em Canadians  --  especially , how the Canadians would find her . Flick 's sense of humor , to say the least , was not Colonial . Still , there was a set out along Shelbourne Avenue , or whatever the name of the street was , that thought itself very English , and Felicity Tyrell would probably find some soul mates among them . He hoped not . He was too busy these days , watching and reporting how England rode the world slump , to have much time for his personal problems . In his conning tower of an office as a foreign newspaper correspondent he saw crisis followed so swiftly by catastrophe that the two terms soon became synonymous . For some time he had been aware that his Washington paper had a distinct " policy " these days  --  and that the prominence given to his carefully produced cables had little connection with the importance of the British events he was reporting . The political group in Washington behind his paper were using English happenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the American public . The May Report was a drastic recommendation of cuts in all of England 's essential services , the pay of the postman , the schoolmaster , the soldier , the sailor  --  in fact every Englishman who worked for the Government , and could not hit back . With the Labor Party hurled into the outer darkness there was nobody left in Parliament strong enough to protect them . They were , therefore , but logical victims . Tony found that he had been selected as another one . Marjory handed him a cable as he came in one morning announcing that his salary had been cut by twenty per cent , and that London office expenditures and entertainment allowance must be held down to below ? io a month . The millionaire Washington newspaper proprietor also added , philanthropically , that Lynd would be expected , along with other members of the staff , to contribute to Washington 's fund for poor relief . " I am now , " he told the bewildered Marjory , " more personally interested than ever in seeing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Christina that night , " Well , my sweet , this means that I will have to live a proper life in spite of myself . On ten pounds a month even I ca n't be dissolute . Any luncheons I give visiting firemen now will have to be out of my own pocket . And my salary now will be just about enough to keep this house above water . " As Tony had at that moment an expensive , but very useful , luncheon planned for several foreign delegates who were in London on conference , he decided to go through with that entertainment anyway  --  and not at his own expense . Luncheon was at the Berkeley , where he ordered the most delicate food and rare wines that that distinguished restaurant could provide . Then , explaining his predicament , he asked each one of his guests to sign the check . In a happy mood over the cognac they all wrote their flourishing and distinguished signatures . Tony then paid the bill and sent the autographed check to Washington along with his expense account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . Lynd wrote the Invergordon " mutiny " of the British Navy over the pay-cuts , when the crew of the battle-cruiser Hood , largest and proudest warship in the world , refused to obey orders and weigh anchor but sat on her anchor 's cables instead , and sang the " Red Flag . " It gave him a grim pleasure when the Tooting Bec schoolteachers suspended all . sports activities as their joint-action with the 2,500 London schoolteachers who had pledged themselves " to restrain from all extraneous activities , " until the National Government replaced the so-called economy cuts it had just ruthlessly made in their meager pay . It was a sardonic comment on a British Government 's morals when the Navy and the schoolteachers feel they have a just cause for strike . He went up to Seaham Harbor to hear Ramsay MacDonald play upon every instrument in the emotional orchestra to persuade that stricken community  | to return him to office . He witnessed Philip Snowden turn with scorpion-like vindictiveness and quote his infamous " three home truths , " in his elections speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet  --  and had the satisfaction of showing in his cables to America that the Iron Chancellor had told merely three half-truths . Such inside knowledge could do but little more than confirm the already low opinion that Tony and his colleagues held of Europe 's and even England 's politicians . Then Tony went down and sat with the one good man he had met in world politics , George Lansbury , and sat with that honest Labor leader all during the fatal morning when the election returns were announcing that the British Labor Party had been almost annihilated in the November panic elections . As the telephone jingled in Lansbury 's little home in Bow Road , and it was announced that one impregnable Labor stronghold after another had been swept by the Conservatives , the so-called National Government Front , the white-haired old statesman 's hand trembled as he lifted the mouthpiece . . . . " It 's an avalanche ! " gasped Lansbury . " . . . Brother . . we are hurled into the outer darkness . . . . " On that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas might continue to call themselves Labor leaders , if it pleased them ; but the working masses of Great Britain , and the world , would never trust them any more . They had sold the pass . And there before him sat the man who , by the sheer goodness of his character , would give dig-nity and power to the little rump of the Labor Party that remained in Parliament . It was a sad thought , for just simple goodness , he could easily foresee , was to count for very little in the sordid days to come . It was the fate of honest men like George Lansbury , that they should be ineffective against the opportunists , that made him loathe the politicians of this world . s s s  | That night , weary , Lynd was sunk in an armchair beside Christina before their fire , when Patrick Byron rushed in . " I 've done it ! " he cried . " I 've done it ! I 've found the straight road . . . . There is just one road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat in such a state of sheer earnestness , Tony tried to joke : " Gone Bolshie ? " " Yes ! That 's precisely what I have done . " He had thrown up his ? i , 000 a year job with his so-called Liberal paper to get a maximum salary on the Daily Worker of ? 2.10.0 a week . It was characteristic of British hypocrisy , declared Pat , that when economies had to be made  --  the people who could not hit back should be the ones the Government would hit first : the poor , the unemployed , the army , navy , postmen , police . " You 're damn ' right , " said Tony ; but then , his sense of fairness aroused , " What about the income tax , and the death duties ? . . . " " Bourgeois ! " sneered Pat , and then laughed : " The rich can stand those . The others ca n't . Can you answer that argu-ment ? " Tony shook his head . The so-called National Government 's economy cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reductions in all British industry . The Government had set a safe example . " And now , " said Lynd to Christina , " I 'm through . We 're going down to Somerset . I 'm going to take a week . I 'll take it whether the paper gives it to me or not . We 're going to get into tweeds , you and I  --  we 'll roam the moors . And I 'll get some rough shooting , some cock pheasants  --  and perhaps a woodcock . " They set off the next morning , the rear of the rickety LeaFrancis full of bags , his gun , and a big fat duffle full of rough tweeds and heavy boots .  | They climbed through the red and dying ferns , waded through rough gorse , watched a pack of staghounds hunt the red deer of Exmoor , walked home at night , exhausted and happy , through the gray and ghostly beechwoods . Christina 's eyes brightened , her fair hair took back its sheen ; she looked ten years younger . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had very little to say to each other . Lynd , making various excuses , usually sought the taproom . One sunset , sipping a pint of soft local beer , he listened to a London " gentleman " being odiously man-to-man with the local rabbit-trapper . The rabbit-trapper , ex-gunner in the R.F.A. , had just driven him back from a rough shoot . " Well , " said the sportsman , frightfully pleased by the way he could talk to a countryman ( because a British yokel always knows a gentleman when he sees one , you know ) , " we 'll just have the other half of this one  --  and then I 'll toodle up to my bath . " " Thank'y , Ser  --  do n't mind if I do . " When the gentleman had gone the local Water Bailiff put down his pipe : " Get anything , Jarge ? " " ' E ? Why , the likes o ' he could n't hit a flock of barn doors coming over . " " That 's one of the worst dangers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christina were eating a dinner of roast pheasant and a sweet with rich Devonshire cream . " Too many ' gentlemen ' ? in quotation marks . Complacent dumbbells ? who love to talk about democracy . ' " His exciting bag on that cold October day had been three cock pheasants , a blackcock  --  shot in the roots ! ? and a woodcock he got going down a long row of dying red beech just at sunset . They took Zeppelin , their dachshund , with them , and she dug almost all the way through to China  --  as she always did on the occasion of such rambling walks . Then she said  --  Woof !  | ? stamped her funny front feet , staring at them with her alert , intelligent brown eyes . " Zeppelin knows more than most dogs , " said Tony , as they watched her digging at lunch , " because her ears are so close to the ground . " " Well , anyway , " said Christina , " she expects to see something drop every time you shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somerset , he and Chris had a few of the happiest days they had ever known together . Even she spoke about it , thanking him , much to his shame , for the days they had had . " I begin to have hope , " she said . " I do n't want to have ever to feel not in love with you . But sometimes , lately , I 've almost felt you wanted me to . It would kill me , I know  --  but do you want to be free ? " He was thankful that , for once , he did not have to lie to her when he affectionately patted her leg , and exclaimed : " Why , of course not ! Good God , Chris , you and I are together for life . I 'll never leave you . " This last , he knew , had always been true  --  even when he was suffering most . He would never leave Chris . A few days after Kyra 's inexplicable scene with Christina and her mother , she had rung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the porter , been ringing him there every day for the past two weeks . He felt nothing against her for her incredible act of coming to make such a scene before Chris and Lady Mallard . Neither did he feel anything for her , one way or the other . Everything was dead now in that direction . But he felt his heart jerk when he saw her pale face at Zappi 's where they had agreed to meet . She was telling the entire Zappi family about the latest Power disaster . " Yes , we had the Bailiffs in . . . going to dispossess us . . . Father 's very ill , you know . . . I smuggled most of the valuable things out into the backyard and over the fence to  | the woman next door . . . the Bailiff never thought of that . was n't that funny ? . . . " Kyra gave a bright little laugh . . . " But we had no beds to sleep on ! Was n't that simply frightful ? . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can the Bailiff take beds ? " said Tony . She stopped long enough to put up her insolent little pug nose towards him , which he kissed obediently ; and then she continued her recital to the sympathetic Zappi family . It made his blood go cold . What that girl could endure ! And how she could talk to every outsider about it . " Are you angry with me , Fofoiser ? " she asked , when the Zappi menage had left them and he could pin her mind down to what she would like to have for dinner . " I 'm afraid I lost my head . " " I should say you did . I wish you were n't so damned communicative . You let me in for a hell of a mess . Not only that , but you 've needlessly hurt Christina . " " But how , Fofoiser ? " He looked at her . " Really , Kyra , " he began ; then he turned to the menu . " Where are you living now ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did n't we , Miss Zappi ? " The Zappi girl , who was now a waitress , nodded . Lynd waited until she had taken the order and left , then he asked : " And now ? " " We have a flat off King 's Road . I told Daddy I 'd bring you around there tonight . He is very low and depressed . " In what had once been a semi-studio , the Powers were living in what , in that one room , looked like royal splendor . Every solitary trinket they had was either along the long mantelpiece or on the top of an ancient sideboard . Ronald was gone . But Mrs. Power now had a salon . This was supplied by a Russian baroness , with a wilted skin powdered the color of pale violet and a tight mesh collar around her sagging neck ,  | and an ancient English major , who said at intervals , " Really , by Jove . . . you do surprise me , Roderick ! " Roderick had become thin and colorless ; only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Lynd and breathed heavily before he could get enough breath to say " Hello . " Mrs. Power had shrunk until her face was like those shrunken heads the South American Indians make . It seemed little larger than an orange . And from beneath her mane of graying hair she stared at Lynd as malevolently as ever . Tony tried not to see any of this . But when he drove Kyra out to the Ace of Spades for a late cup of coffee and a toasted cheese sandwich , a thing she adored , he said : " My dear , a few days ago I was ready to murder you . I was . But.I do want to tell you one thing ; you are a blasted little idiot  --  but I also think you are , without any reservation , the bravest person I have ever known ! " " Oh . . . Fofoiser ! how nice . . . . " She was trembling . " But I ca n't keep it up , you know . Not always . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ? They made no attempt to return to their former status . Except once . One Saturday afternoon in late summer , when he met her , he was so dead beat that he could hardly talk to her . He left the car where it was and dragged her to the nearest pub . " For Christ 's sake , " he said , " just let 's sit still for a minute . Do n't talk . " He spilt the whisky as he lifted the glass . " You look dreadful ! " she said . " You 're in a terrible state . What 's the matter ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " I 'm all shot to bits . . .. The Paris office has an extra man , so has Berlin , so has Rome ? only London , in all this business , the center of it all  --  I 've just myself . And I 've got that damn ' cable to beat out before two o'clock every day . Then . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three double whiskies now every day after my cable goes . And I do n't stop there ! " She gave her bird-like laugh . " Do you know what you 're going to do ? We are going across to Calais tonight . There 's just time  --  if we act fast . Got some money ? " " No . But I can get some at my club . It 's only a few streets off . " Kyra nearly knocked him out with the pace she drove that decrepit Lea-Francis for Dover . They just caught the last Calais boat . They stayed in the station hotel , their window overlooking the painted funnels and masts in the harbor . They opened their windows and looked at them as they were having croissants and honey and big bowls of French coffee for breakfast . They stayed there all day . " Oh , I 'm so happy , " she said . Then a whistle blew . He happened to have his arm around her at the time . And she nearly jumped out of her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who need the help  --  not a big lump like me . " " I 'm so tired , darling . " A week later , after he had left his office , Marjory came running after him down the street . A hospital , she said , had just telephoned and said that Miss Kyra Power was there . Could Mr. Lynd come at once . Marjory handed him a slip of paper with the name and address written on it , and Tony jumped into a passing cab . At the end of a long ward , full of mute and twisted bodies under their white sheets , he saw some screens around a bed . Harrowed by the faces of pain that followed him he almost ran to it . Kyra lay with her heavy hair splashed across a pillow , her lips open and puffed , her dark eyes beseeching his . He leaned down and kissed her dry lips . " Fofoiser ! " she whispered . When she tried to smile he felt that he could bear it no longer . " Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right back . "  | IIe was frantic . He located the doctor on duty and said : " But she ca n't lie here . . . not when I can help her . Ca n't I move her ? " The doctor shook his head . " Is it as bad as all that ? " " Yes  --  her heart . It is simply run down . It does n't want to work any more . Do you know anything about her ? " Lynd saw the doctor eyeing him , and knew the thoughts that must be running through his mind ; here is her man , he was thinking coldly  --  a man who did not take care of her . He was desperate with self-reproach . He summoned all his will , and said : " She simply must get well ! I 'll do anything you like , I . . . we can afford it . Just tell me what you want me to do . " " Just a second , " said the doctor , " I 'll go back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him looking down into Kyra 's eyes . What he saw there made him smile ; he nodded to Tony to follow him . " It 's all right , " he said . " If she lies here for a week or two  --  perfectly quiet  --  and you can take some worry off her mind , I think we could move her in a few weeks . Then I must tell you , I think it 's nothing but Switzerland . . . . " He tapped his chest . " It is n't only her heart . She is just at the end of her vitality . Give her all the strength you 've got . " They were happy afternoons . One day when the Sister smiled and said : " I know all about you , Mr. Lynd , " Tony knew that Kyra was becoming her old self again  --  he could imagine her gossiping with the hospital staff . The screens had been removed , and always , when he came into the ward , he saw her talking earnestly to the emaciated old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both share the flowers , Fofoiser ! " Kyra chirped happily . It was an experience that filled him with the most punishing self-accusations . Which made him feel cheap and ashamed of his own easy life . Which , if things had not been the way they  | were , might have been the making of him . He had told Christina about these visits on the first Sunday , when he explained why he would have to leave the Mallards ' at once after lunch . Chris had been upset , but had quickly agreed with his anxiety . She had even got several places , with their prices , in Switzerland . But as Kyra became stronger , the idea of Switzerland was refused . She shook her head stubbornly . The day before she was ready to leave , she said to him : " Take me away , Fofoiser . Take me some place into the country , where we have been before . Spend the night with me , as we used to do . " They decided upon the same hotel overhanging the weir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon from the hospital in his car . They had tea at the far end of the lawn , under the cherry tree , Kyra lying in a deck-chair . There she said : " I 've given up , Fofoiser . I 'm going back . Yes . . . India . So you wo n't see me any more , Fofoiser . " He sat silent , staring at the river . " Perhaps it is just as well , " he said finally . " Oh . . . Fofoiser ! " He could not meet her eyes , but he heard her saying : " I 've always loved you . Always . I 've lied to you so , Fofoiser . . . told you such fibs . . . just because I love you . That time when you came back from Berlin . . . and you ran into Bumby . . . " " Yes ? " " Well . . . he was paying for that flat . Fofoiser  --  look at me . . . . " " Yes , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one after you and I came back , and asked me not to try and get a divorce . He said I could n't , and there 'd only be such a fuss that both he and Edward would have to resign their commissions . Edward wrote too . . . the most amazing letter , Fofoiser . . . and said that whenever I wanted to I could always come back .  | I had a letter from him only last week , and he still feels the same way . He 's an amazing man ! " " He must be , " said Tony slowly . " I do n't love him . " Tony knew that Kyra was wanting him to look at her . She wanted him to give the answer to that last prompting sentence . But he shook his head . " Is it Miss Tyrell ? " she asked . " It 's everything , Kyra . Flick . . . Christina . . . . It 's no use . No use at all . It 's  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lying to you even here , Fofoiser . Bumby did n't write  --  I did . I wrote to both of them from Nice . I knew on the boat that you and I would never , never get married . Up until then I had always been foolish enough to hope . .. . " You see , " she said , her voice changing slightly , " I had always remembered you as you were . Silly , was n't it ? But when I remembered how fierce and determined you used to be , I always thought that , oh , if I could ever find my Fofoiser again , he would put everything right ! I thought you just could do anything ! And then I found out . " " What ? " " Oh , that you did n't want to , Fofoiser . That 's part . " " And the rest ? " " That Life does n't want to  --  it does n't want us to marry . And so we never shall . You tell Christina , Fofoiser . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know why Christina does stick to me , but she does  --  and as long as she does , I 'll stick to Christina . Perhaps , after I get burnt out a bit more , I 'll become a decent husband again ? " She laughed . " You 'll always be a rogue , Fofoiser . That 's why you 're so nice . But I do n't think you 're happy . " They talked surprisingly easily from then on . With her patient soul she bore him no grudge for his obvious relief that she was going back to her husband again , and that India was such a long way off . Her chief concern was what her mother and father would do if Roderick lost his present job .  | And when the conversation took that turn Lynd discovered that her principal reason for lingering on in England was because she wanted to be with her parents . It was only with them , it seemed , that she could ever feel carefree and happy . But even so , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way they had become . She told Tony she felt like deserting , " to go off like this ! " But here , he saw , Kyra only wanted strengthening of her purpose from him . And he gave it to her . " Tell me the truth , " he said . " You are n't lying to me about your husband ? " " Why should I , Fofoiser ? I  --  I told you about Bumby , did n't I ? I do n't know what to think of Edward . He really must be a remarkable man ! " Tony thought of India , of poor old Budgin blowing his brains out over a girl in the Delhi hotel . He looked at Kyra lying there , so fresh and lovely now . Heavens . . . there was a lot of life for those two people yet ! He thought of that ghastly , despairing menage out at Hammersmith , full of Pekinese ; life was horrible , but " Get back to India just as quick as you can ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony in a reckless mood . " I see you have been drinking again , " she said . " Of course . And you 've been having another affair . " " Well , what business is that of yours ? " She stared at him . " Damn you , " he said . " Look here  --  if we 're going to go on at each other like this there is no use going out this evening , is there ? " " Not much . " They were sitting in a Strand pub . " I 'm fed up with myself , " said Tony . He told her the story of Kyra 's departure . " There 's the story of what was once a perfectly decent love . . . and look at the end of it . " His hand trembled as he  | squirted the soda into another glass . " My God . . . when I think of the muck that we make of our lives . Or is it just that life is built that way  --  that the rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just does n't exist in this world . I know that I was an utter sweep not to go off with her . . . but she knew from the first that I would n't . I told her so . Yet . . . I took what I could get . The trouble with Kyra was ? she was n't scheming enough  --  like you . " " Thank you , " said Flick . " Well , you know what I mean . You go into life as people went into battle , prepared to come back with your shield , or on it . You give no quarter . You do n't expect any . The hell of it all is . . . that you do look upon life as if every man was your enemy . You are always on guard with him . You are on guard with me . You wo n't let yourself be yourself . . . for fear something might hit you . You 're like a damned little lobster , with a shell on it . . . and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flick laughed at this , a welcome note of gaiety in her usual hoarse rasp . He was quite prepared for the invariable " Of course ! " she made . " You like being called hard , " he said . " You love being a cynic . You adore being told that if any man opens his heart to you he is playing with certain death . " " Of course ! " gurgled Flick . " Sure you do . All because you 're sure in your own mind that you 're really a soft , sentimental little woman . Well , you 're not . You 're a swine , Flick . " She was in ecstasy over this attack . So much so that he ceased to make it . Flick had gone around so long , with her sword in hand in this world , that he was n't going to play up to that side of her character any more . There could be a certain tartness in these semi-playful recriminations with Flick that were as exhilarating as a rough towel , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you throw your head back .  | But the thing he had really wanted to tell Flick as he waited for her to stride in through the door tonight was that he was bored with the over-use of his own emotions . He wanted to give them a rest . He wanted peace . He did n't even want the renewed nerve-strain that the continuation with Flick would mean . He was not tired with Flick . Far from it . FIe would like to keep on seeing her . Why not ? " That 's just the point , " he said , suddenly speaking aloud his moody soliloquy . " If you and I keep on seeing each other we are simply bound to have a succession of rows . . . not necessarily rows with each other . . . just rows that the situation will bring . And it 's not worth it . See my point ? " " Well . . . if you feel that way , " said Flick . " Well and good . " She looked around the room , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other people present , yawned , and said : Good night . " He walked along to his club . This had been probably the most unsatisfactory quarrel they had ever had . There had been no meaning to it . As he walked slowly up St. James 's he thought of how often he had let his impatience bungle this thing called love , the unbelievable amount of trouble he had willingly let himself in for to get it , the substitutes he had usually accepted for love itself . In the early days he had danced like a crazy Harlequin to the joy from the mere newness of his sensations . Just excitement . Then , a bit more critical , it had been the search for the exotic , the romance of its setting . Moscow , for instance , with its Asiatic horizon of the painted church domes against the green midnight sky ; and New York , the adventure of coming out into its silent , empty streets , when you could hear your own footsteps , and only the highest windows caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness had long been down , and the philosophy of the midnight coffee stalls ; the ecstatic security of his own cabin on the P. &; O. boat , when he had snapped the lock behind him . . . and turned to take the triumph he had been planning for fourteen years . Yes , but even  | as that victory turned to ashes , as he took it he knew that he had been shown a mockery  --  Kyra was just a lovely frivolity . That was why he had urged her to return to India . That was why he had lied to Flick tonight . Flick meant peace . But he could not have it with her , not with the tenderness he still felt for Christina in his heart . There could be no peace . Therefore the only thing to do was to steel himself into renouncing Felicity , and win back to that comparative rest of his emotions he had known during his ten years ' former faithfulness to Christina . It had been a strange sensation , this conscious tranquillity . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been the major reef that had done so much to wreck his and Christina 's life . He had only imagined it was . And imaginations in things like that , of course , were as tangible and destructive as rocks . With a good half of his mind always absorbed with vain regrets about Kyra , it was a miracle that Christina had lived with him as long as she had . That she had not quarreled more about inconsequential things . That her straightforward spirit had managed to survive . But the harm had been done . He knew now , in Christina 's subdued manner , the lack of any spontaneity in her laugh , that he had taken the edge off her spirit . It was one of those things , he knew , that could not be replaced . Christina had been marred . That was the thing that he could not say to Flick tonight ? because he never discussed Christina with her  --  and that was the situation that he must make the best of now . He would miss the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would miss the physical side . But what he gained by continuing with Felicity was not enough to justify his punishing faithful Christina any longer . " My God ! " he said to himself as he walked up his club 's steps , " I must be getting what people call a healthy mind ! " But , immediately , the sight of the womanless men sitting in the club bar threw him into a panic . There was no more terrifying sight in the world than these lonely men , trying to keep  | up a languid and lack-luster conversation with each other as they sat in bored companionship over their wine in the almost empty dining-room . Or that of the club habitues , leaning against the bar . He was terrified that he was already jettisoning most of his recent encouraging philosophy . With dismay he followed the others ' hungry glances as they watched a clubmate come in and pick up , at the bar , six bottles of hock that he was taking on to an after-theatre supper . Good God , he hoped he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked so solemn , himself , and lonely , drinking double whiskies in the corner , that he was asked what he was thinking of . " What 's on your mind , old boy ? " " Oh , nothing . . . . " Tony smiled . " I was just thinking that it is only the rich who can be philosophic about the joys of poverty . " Leaving them to puzzle out this cryptic remark he went down to the desk and tried to telephone Felicity . She was not at home . He tried two places where he thought she might have gone . He could not think of any other . What on earth , he wondered , is she doing with herself now ? Damn it , if I had n't been such a fool we would already be in bed together . He went back upstairs , pulled his chair up to join the group , and finally accepted their hilarious invitation to make a night of it with a snooker party . He played sadly , angered by the fleshy interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall in Sloane Square he ate two saveloys , and listened to a man tell him that his father had worked for thirty-eight years in a mine  --  and then gone blind ; his mother had died of cancer ; and he had gone to Canada  --  where the Manitoba farmers made him eat porridge for breakfast . " They made me eat it ! " he whimpered . " Good God , " said Tony . " ' S'tragedy ! " " My sister took gas , " said the man .  | " Good night , " said Tony . " You 're breaking my heart ! " He walked over to the Embankment and made himself sick . There was a chill in the dawn air , and when he softly let himself into the house , he saw that Christina had been sitting that night with her chair before the fire . The drawing-room was just as she had left it . The embers of the wood fire had died . But Christina 's sewing lay on the arm of the deep chair and a novel she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing anything with her hands  --  lay on the old Indian carpet . That was a bad omen . Chris always read herself to sleep . She must have been unhappy when she went to bed . Upstairs , on their treasured worm-drilled bed-table , he saw a tube of Phanadorm tablets . Chris had taken these to put herself to sleep . He was always afraid she would take an overdose  --  perhaps on purpose . He must warn her again about that in the morning . He stood there , staring down at her face . In sleep , Christina 's high-cheeked little face had a stubborn look . And all the sadness he had put her through showed in her mouth  --  the corners of her lips were slightly drawn down . As if she were dreaming of some unhappy incident . Yes , he thought , she had plenty to dream of there . But  --  could he help it , could he help it ? . . . Was n't it just too damned unlucky that life had trapped them like this ? He wondered what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? Her eyes opened : " It 's you , Peter ? " she said sleepily . " Yes . " She was fighting to get back into the oblivion of sleep . " Listen , Chris , " he said , " I want to talk to you . " He sat down on the edge of the bed and reached for her hand . It humiliated him to see how quickly she sat up and removed the net from her hair . She wanted to look attractive . " Do n't sit on Zeppelin , " she said . " She 's somewhere in the  | bed . " A stir from below Christina 's feet at the sound of the word " Zeppelin " showed the dachshund 's whereabouts . That was an added blow to Lynd 's disordered mind . " Yes , " he told Chris , " I have got a disordered mind . I ca n't think straight these days . I 'm so damned muddled up . You know I love you  --  and yet , look what I do to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For a little while . Only at the beginning of the evening . " " Oh , Peter . . . " " I know . It 's hell . " He patted her hand and stood up . There was nothing to say . There never was . As he was sitting on his bed , taking off his trousers , the ' phone on the bed-table rang . He grabbed it . He knew it would be Flick . And it was . She was very drunk . " You little ! . . . " she said . " Listen , " he said . " You shut up . Can you hear me ? Well , go to hell ! " He jammed the receiver back on the hook . In a few minutes the ' phone rang again . This time he took off the receiver and let it stand . For a second or so both of them could hear Flick 's rasping voice . Then there was silence . " There is one thing , at least , that you could do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could prevent your mistress calling up before breakfast to have a drunken scene with you when I am still in bed . " " I know it , " he moaned . " I 'll stop that . " But what he was really thinking about was : Where did Flick get so drunk ? Who was she with ? Had she been sleeping with someone ? Where ? The scene slid on . Cracks in the world facade widened into crevasses . Public figures , one-time idols , toppled into them . Reporting the London end of European conferences , Lynd searched through the speeches of the statesmen and delegates , and knowing what was being kept hidden from the public  --  knew that all he was  | sending in expensive cables to the United States was just blah , blab , blah . . . . He got his head cracked the night the police charged the " hunger marchers " in Trafalgar Square . He and another correspondent were standing below the horse-statue of King Charles the Martyr . Behind them a jam of Bloomsbury intellectuals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nelson 's column . " Get out of our way ! " an infuriated police Inspector yelled at them , " an ' let us get at those bloody barstards ! " When they charged , one of the footpolice took a passing swipe at Lynd 's head that knocked him over . It did not hurt ; but he was stunned by the blow , and when the mounted police swept past he saw several figures squirming on the asphalt . One man was dragged past him with the blood shining black in his matted hair . A man had been knocked by a police-horse through the window of a raincoat shop by the tube entrance . He was still impaled there  --  stuck on a thick sliver of plate-glass . When Lynd forced his way to him he was moaning : " I was only looking ! . . . Only looking ! . . . " A " gentleman " was pulled from his horse in Hyde Park ! " Now that is Revolution ! " exulted Patrick Byron . Byron was seldom shaved these days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever combed his hair . At any rate , Patrick was always shoving his long fingers through it . But he was wildly , deliriously happy . " I 'm doing something ! " he said . " With my job on the paper I really am in the thick of it . Taking part , by Heaven ! It 's grand ! " " Wish I had even the fool faith that Patrick 's got ! " said Lynd , as Christina sopped some of the blood out of his hair the night of Trafalgar Square . " I 'm having to send an awful bunch of tripe to the paper these days . " He laughed . " But I 'll put some heart into tonight 's . This is one of the few events where I have not been altogether on the side-lines ! "  | He wrote an ironic description of the scene that night ; how the real " hunger marchers " had been blockaded by the police from reaching Parliament to present their petition . Later , he sent a cable full of bitterness about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom were not even on the scene that gory night . He was surprised at the big play the American papers gave them . Perhaps , he thought , it is because misery loves company ; and they wanted to show that things are just as bad over in England as they were in police riots at home . " But if we had had Chicago or New York police in Trafalgar Square that night , " he told Christina , " there 'd been a lot of deaders Instead of merely wounded men . " With Flick , of course , he had made things up . He did it the next morning after she had telephoned . He was ashamed at his own weakness . But , he knew , he wanted to be with her  --  and ould put up with anything when it came to a show-down . He tried to harden himself . When a friend came through from Moscow and he introduced him to Flick , he was not at all surrised when a few days later this friend asked him : " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynd had to laugh at such aivete : " No , why should I ? I have no monopoly , you know . Go to it . " Things had come to a pretty pass  --  he had deliberately invited him . Whether the young man did or not , Lynd never actually knew . He did not want to know . In New York , from what he heard , everybody was so " advanced " on sex that even this young man 's request would not be considered out of place . But he had to chuckle a few days later when his friend complained : " That girl 's a bitch , she is . She 'll sleep with you because she likes it . But there 's no love there . Ever notice how she never looks at you , straight in the eyes , as she is talking with you ? "  | The affair ended abruptly when the young man tried to take Flick up to his room in one of London 's most respectable hotels . " But I 'm an artist ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when that official had requested that " the young lady " evacuate Room 206 without delay . Artist or no artist , he was told by the manager , this hotel was evidently not the kind that the gentleman thought it was . Would he like to move ? He took a Tourist Class ticket on the next boat he could get for the United States . " So that 's that ? " grinned Lynd at Felicity , accusingly . " Of course ! " she rasped . But Tony never wanted to see that friend again . With the advent of Roosevelt several of the London correspondents lost their jobs . One of them , a man who loved England , and thought himself ensconced forever in that gentle land , shot himself . Another vanished into oblivion , and , Lynd hoped , the peace of the English countryside . Another buried himself in a Spanish village on the Mediterranean coast and wrote a book about what he called his " episodic life . " It was a bitter book called " To Reign in Hell ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a best-seller on both sides of the Atlantic . Although its author was very funny about it . " Look at ' em ! " he cried , shoving a pile of American newspaper clippings under Lynd 's nose . " Look what those Goddam New York book critics say about me  --  that I have n't felt anything ! Jessus H. Christ . . . after all I 've been through ! . . . " 1932 , 1933 came and went , with their succession of futile international conferences leaving a trail like an earthquake  | behind them . At the 1932 World Economic Conference , Lynd , for the first time , met his other boss . The ex-Senator from Georgia stepped out of the train onto Victoria railway platform accompanied by an egg-headed college economist carrying an enormous golf-bag with about a hundred clubs in it . Things , from the very start , did not look too good . The Senator from Georgia was a neat , dapper little man ( Lynd had been told he was quite an " element " in Washington 's social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did nothing to belittle that first impression . He began to " pan " the conference before he even asked what it was all about  --  which , in this fiasco of all fiascos , was just the right line to adopt . Lynd had ordered him his suite of rooms at Claridge 's ; some of the London personages to whom the British Ambassador in Washington had subtly given him a letter ( with , Lynd judged , warning letters and instructions sent on ahead ) found the Senator from Georgia a genu-ine English Lord to play golf with ! And Lynd forgot all about him . The Senator seldom came out to the Geological Museum where the conference was being held , and that kindly old gentleman , Secretary Cordell Hull , spoke to empty houses on the abolition of quotas , high tariffs , etc. ( the wise British on the eve of the conference having hastily concluded rade treaties with Denmark and seven other countries  --  all of hem including the very things the conference was in session to abolish ) ? yes , dear old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead volcanoes which hung outside the committeeoom 's wall . And Tony , with a hundred or so other bored correspondents , dutifully cabled their paper weeks of more official hypocrisy , subterfuge , and just plain lies , and voted the Geological Museum bar the best non-restricted club in Europe . " Well , it 's been a great conference , " said the Senator from Georgia , pump-handling Lynd 's hand as Tony saw him off on the boat-train for Paris . " I just reckon this ought to show that maniac , Roosevelt , where he gets off ! " The Senator seemed genial enough . But , like the toneless flash of heat lightning in a calm summer sky , Lynd several times noticed what he took to be a flash of positive hatred in  | the Senator 's eyes . He was a tricky politician , who prided himself on keeping a poker-face ; so Lynd was not sure . " Nevertheless , " he said to Christina , after he had driven back for luncheon when he had seen the Senator off , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for old Hancock . And I wonder where the hell he  --  and Sweetie  --  are these days ? " He looked out into the little paved back garden , shaded by overhanging summer leaves , and thought secretly what a blow it would be to Christina if they ever had to leave this little house . So much of it was just her ! But things were not static for Lynd . Quite the opposite . He had been drinking secretly lately . Some time back , their little wine cellar under the foot of the stairs had always had a couple of bottles of whisky in it . Now , he noticed , Chris had taken them out . Only the wine remained . She said she did it because of the servants ; she did n't want either of the fresh young Norwegian girls to give it to their young men . But he knew the real reason . Christina had pled with him about it . " You 've got such a fine body , Peter , and such a future . Why let it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said irritably . " Nervous as hell ! " He tried playing more tennis at his club . It was a wholesome environment . The people out there were as different from those he was flung with in his work as if they had come from another race . Many of them were the usual type of retired English Army or naval officer ; some of the younger ones were stockbrokers , bankers , or in the Civil Service . The girls were pretty  --  but too healthy , Lynd thought . " Trouble with me , " he thought one day , as he sipped a whisky-and-soda in his white flannels on the cool veranda , " I 'm just depraved . " He wanted Flick 's sneering , scarlet lips . . . .  | The thing happened without warning . Flick was to meet him at a restaurant in the Strand . When she was already a quarter of an hour late she telephoned him there , saying she would be another fifteen minutes . Without thinking , he walked along to the hotel opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came in he saw Flick sitting in the lounge with that grisly little South African artist . A waiter was just bringing them two fresh glasses of whisky . As they had not seen him , he turned and went along to the hotel bar . He found two other correspondents there and accepted their invitation to have a drink . Then he bought a round . Flick could now wait for him . It soon came to his turn to buy another round of drinks . When the South African himself came in , Tony also bought him a drink . " I 'm becoming a real sadist , " he thought . He saw the boy from the pub across the street come in and look around . The boy came over and said the police wanted him to move his car . " Move my car ? Sure I 'll move it . Back in a minute . " Lynd took his car from the side street and drove it around to a parking place . As he turned around Covent Garden , he scraped a standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was on his way back to apologize and offer to pay the damages , when a helmeted policeman seized him . " Did you ' it that there car ? " he demanded . " I did , " said Lynd . " And I was just going back to it . Why ? " " I 'm going to charge you , sir . " " What for ? " " For being under the h'infiuence of alcohol while in charge of a motorcar . " " Go on  --  you 're joking . Take your hand off my arm . " Lynd jerked his arm away from him and tried to walk on . " ' Ere , ' ere , sir  --  nonna that ! " " What the hell are you trying to do ! " Lynd was angry now . lie gave his arm another jerk to free it . The next instant Lynd was seized . The officer who was holding him was beckoning to another policeman who ap-  | geared at the end of the street . They both seized him and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the street turn and dash off . Filled with fury at her , his own actions , the indignity of his position , he made a last frantic effort to fling the Bobbies off . " You idiots ! " he hissed . " You damn ' pair of fools ! Lemme go . . . . " Now , he realized , he was getting drunk . And just at that instant the fat figure of Freddy Wayson swung the corner , heading for Boulestin 's . " Hello , hello , hello , old boy ! " cheerily piped Freddy . " Just come back from India to find you in this position . What is it , officer ? " " Drunk , sir . . . . ' It that there motorcar . " With a wit that never left him , Freddy laughed . " You 're absolutely right , officer  --  take him up . But , I say  --  let 's find a taxi . Ca n't walk him this way , you know  --  not all the way to Bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman hesitated . But Freddy had already hailed a passing taxi . " Well , " he grinned , when Lynd , he , and one of the officers sat down inside , " this is damn bad luck . Do you have to take him up , officer ? " He told the cab to stop . The officer told the driver to go on . There was no use trying to argue about it , he said . This here gentleman was going up before a magistrate . " Tried to ' it me , ' e did . " " Now that 's a bloody lie ! " said Lynd . " Shut up , " said Freddy , giving his hand a hard clutch . " Well , it is a damn lie ! You get up there and say that , officer , and I 'll call you a bloody liar right before the whole court . Wish to God I had hit you  --  you big stiff . " In the charge-room the sergeant on the desk perfunctorily asked Lynd did he want his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a monstrous injustice , said they could bring any doctor they liked . He glared at the officer who had arrested him . When the police-station doctor finally came , he flashed a light in Lynd 's eyes , asked him to walk a straight line  --  seemed to hesitate  --  and then nodded .  | " You 're a Canadian , are n't you ? " he asked Lynd . " No . American . Now I suppose that means you will try and give me the limit . Yes ? " " No , sir  --  we do n't do things like that . Not in England . " " Oh  --  do n't you ! " said Lynd . His watch , money , and other trinkets were taken away from him and he was led into a stone corridor stinking of disinfectant , where a smudged green door was opened , and he found himself in a cell . Later he learned that it was the same one occupied for a time by the famous Dr. Crippen . Freddy Wayson told him that . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . There was a long , bare plank bench stretching the length of this human coop with a hole at the far and to be used with a lavatory bucket . Grinning grimly , Lynd lay down with his feet towards the lavatory end . Then he reached for his cigarettes . When he found that a treasured old Russian copper cigarette case had also been taken away from him , he set up a row . Through the aperture in the heavy board door he sent along a few shouts . After a time a policeman came along outside and asked him what he wanted . " You ca n't have them , " he said when Lynd asked for his case back . " Even steal those from me ! " jeered Lynd . " You 're a hell of a fine lot , you are  --  you London policemen . Oh , do n't you think our policemen are splendid ? ' " he mimicked . The police officer grinned at him . " I will see what I can do , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat Freddy some time to locate Christina . When he did locate her by telephone in the country , Tony 's wife was all for rushing up to the town at once . " But it would n't do any good , I told her , " said Freddy through the  | door peep-hole . " We do n't want her to see you in here , do we ? " " Should say not , " said Lynd . " I can bail you out , " said Freddy . " I 'm broke myself . But if you 'll sign a chit I 'll go over and get it cashed at your club . " " What 's the use ? " said Lynd . " Might as well spend the night here . Call up my solicitor , will you  --  here 's his address . Tell him what 's what . I probably wo n't want him anyway . And thanks , Freddy  --  get me a couple of packets of Gold Flakes sent in . I 'll probably not sleep well tonight . This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddy . " I 'll just bugger off down to Fleet Street now . . . see that this damn thing does n't get into the papers : American Correspondent at Bow Street ? Ha-cha ! " Christina 's face met him as he was led into the courtroom the next morning . It said : " All right , " and her smile was loyal ? if wan . She had , as it happened , raced home that night ; but the police told her he had refused bail and was already sound asleep . Which was true ; he had slept until wakened in the morning . So she had had to go through all of that night with her thoughts . Christina , with her upbringing  --  in spite of her association with him  --  could not take things like this lightly . Try as hard as she loyally would . He had to sit in a row with the other " offenders " and see two minor criminals given a few days for an attempted theft of articles from a parked motorcar . A flashy young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Soho . Two girls were turned over to the Matron on some charge that Lynd did n't listen to . And then the sight of the officer , the original one who had laid hands on him , sent him into a tremble of rage again . He had to stand in the dock while the officer read from his notebook . Lynd waited , hoping he would not shout out if the officer attempted to say Lynd  | had hit him ; but all the officer said in his high sing-song voice was " He resisted arrest . " Lynd admired the Magistrate 's sense of justice when he made the officer admit that he had placed his hands on Lynd before Tony made any fuss . The officer also had to admit that he had found Lynd 's car , parked precisely and in a narrow space . " That shows , " said the Magistrate , " that he was not incapable of driving a car ? " The officer had to agree with that . Then Lynd took the stand , and , still trembling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well ; the Magistrate made an occasional note . Then he nodded and Lynd stepped down . " I shall fine you ? 3o and suspend your driving license for one year , " said the Magistrate , calmly placing his finger tips together . " Wha ? " Lynd bit down on his lip . " Perfectly outrageous ! " burst out Christina as soon as he joined her outside the court . She said it before a body of waiting policemen , while Lynd was writing out a check to pay for his fine . " You  --  you dare to call this British justice ! What about that Guards ' officer who kicked one of you in the wrist the other night and said , Take your hands off me , you swine ? ca n't you see I 'm a member of the ruling class ? ' . . . You only fined him ten shillings ! British police ! " " Well , Madam , I ? " " I do n't want to hear any more from you . Where is my husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night  --  although the car was in the police yard  --  the battery had run down . And one of the policemen , smitten by Christina 's attack , insisted upon cranking it for them . Christina thanked him , a bit mollified . Then she took the wheel . " Funny . . . " mused Tony as they were going out to Chelsea ? " to think that I do n't dare touch that driving wheel ! "  | " Well , you never did like my driving , " said Christina . " Now you 've got to . " The Mallard family were very sympathetic and clannish about it . Christina had not said a word of reproach to Tony . She was too furious with the police . But , at their regular Sunday lunch with the Mallards , something that the General had probably said to her aside , made her explode at the table . She repeated again the incident of the ten shilling fine against the Guards ' officer who had kicked a policeman on the wrist . " They did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American . I know it . I could see it in that Magistrate 's complacent , mincing face . " " Oh , I say ! " protested the General . " I would n't say that . That 's not British , you know . " " British be damned ! " said Christina . " Now , Chris . . . " said her mother , looking pained . Bow Street ! Lynd needed no explanation to see how that name shocked the Mallards . They were horrified . But they were with him  --  all of them . Even Christina 's uncle came around after lunch to show how he felt . " Sorry , old chap ? they certainly do come down on you these days . Motoring offenses . Have to use Chris as a chauffeur  --  what ? " Lynd thought of Flick . Was it she he had seen at the end of that street ? Flick had not been sympathetic about Bow Street  --  which pleased him . And he had put her on the defensive . He was never to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . He had consented , after her insistent telephoning at his office , to meet her in the lounge of the Carlton Hotel . But he had tried not to be friendly . When he saw that she was almost in tears , he decided he was silly to be so upset about it all . After all , what possible good could she have done if she  | had stuck around ? He asked himself that . For a week he managed to evade making another engagement with her . During this time Lady Mallard got hold of him . She coughed . " Tony , " she said , " do n't you think that you really ought to try a cure ? " " I do , " said Tony . " I do n't like to interfere , " said Lady Mallard , " but you do n't know how distressed Christina is about all this . She has n't said anything  --  not one thing . But I know that little face , and when I see it like it is now I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-man dog , you know  --  and her whole life is centered around you . Wo n't you pull up ? " Here , again , was this reserved decency of the Mallards . " For a mother-in-law , " smiled Tony , taking her hand , " I must say you are a wonder . Why do n't you preach at me ? Why be so decent ? I know I 'm a sweep . . . . " " I do n't think so  --  not yet . I 've been talking to Dr. Sundersen  --  the Swedes are very realistic about such things , you know  --  and he said that with a man like you , so full of life and  --  and lustiness , as he put it  --  that it is terribly hard not to have the excitement you get from alcohol . And then  --  you began so late , you know . Drinking , I mean . Why , when you married Chris  --  why , up until the two last years ! ? we none of us ever gave a thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . . . but then we all have done that . " Lady Mallard was progressing towards some definite suggestion , Tony could see that . " Now just what is it , " he said , anticipating things , " that you want me to do ? " " Dr. Harbrace ! " said Lady Mallard . " Who 's he ? " " Well . . . it 's pretty awful . But he stopped Charley Portley . " Charles Portley , now Lord Swivvle , had been the outstanding scandal of the Mallard set . It was estimated , people said fairly , that he drank ? 5o worth of wine and whisky every week . He was now a teetotaler  --  but seemed to have lost all interest in life . " Not a good example , " said Lynd . " He acts as if he had all the life taken out of him . " Lady Mallard stiffened . " Well , something must be done . " " All right , " said Lynd , angry now , " I 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turned out the doctor 's name was Laybrush ( Lady Mallard could never get a name right ) , but she had already been to Dr. Laybrush , who knew all about Lynd when he and Christina drove there the next evening . " So you 're the culprit ? " he said cheerily . Lynd did not like this opening and stared at him coldly . " If you put it that way , " he said . It was humiliating , this experience ; but , he said to himself , it must be worse for Chris . They both sat down and stared at the mousy , unkempt little man before them . He might be a genius . . . . His hair , and his study , and his whole house certainly looked untidy enough ; a man who lived for science . Certainly , he had no bedroom manner . " Well , if you want to take it , " sniggered Laybrush . " What is it ? " asked Lynd . Laybrush explained that experimenting over twenty years with a drug that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession of over-doses he could make people stop drinking . One of his patients , a woman whom he had dragged back from death after an almost successful gas-oven suicide , had offered her unwanted body to the experiment . This was to see how much he could increase the dose without killing people . He now knew its limits . And  --  Lord Swivvle was one result . " But he 's so dead , " said Lynd . " I do n't want something that 's going to leave me a walking corpse afterwards . " " Indeed not ! " said Christina . " Do n't you take it , Peter  --  if you feel that is what it is going to do . " Laybrush sniggered . " Lord Swiffle , " he said , blurring his v 's  | like a German , " was always dead . It was a shame to stop him drinking . I would undo it if I could . But  --  with him  --  it seems to have worked marvels ! " This was more like it . Lynd looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with me ? " he asked . " You 'll think you 're going to die . No  --  do n't smile , " said Dr. Laybrush , suddenly very serious . " You will think you are dying . And you will be very near it . That 's why you will see ? if you are willing to undergo this cure  --  that you will never be left alone for an instant . A nurse will always be with you . " Lynd felt a little clutch grasp his stomach . This did sound drastic . Also , it sounded as if there might be something to it . If it was as bad as all that . . . " All right , I 'll take it , " he said . The next afternoon , a very sunny and bright one , Lynd was admitted by one of those chalky , flat-breasted women who always seem to become Matrons of London nursing homes , into a dark and dismal former private house in Knollington Place . He was standing there in his top-floor room , gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laybrush tripped into the room . " I suppose I 'd better get undressed and get into bed ? " said Lynd . " Yes . You 'll be there several days . Nurse will put away your clothes for you . You 'll have nothing to eat or drink , you know ? except straight whisky  --  and you wo n't hold that down very long . Not much . It is very unpleasant . But you can smoke , you know . All you want to . I stuck this into a feller 's behind once , you know  --  and he hopped straight out of bed and went to Paris . He had been posing as a Buddha , naked , before his wife . You wo n't do that , will you ? " " Which ? What ? " asked Lynd . " Why , go to Paris . "  | " No , I sha n't go to Paris . Where do you want me to take it  --  arm  --  or behind ? " " Arm will do . There . Now I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit . You begin to heat up in a minute . I do n't want a coroner . . . " Lynd lay back and felt nothing at first . Then it seemed as if someone had turned on an electric light bulb inside him . He began to burn . " It 's here , " he said , gazing inquisitively at Dr. Laybrush . Dr. Laybrush had jumped up and now put a half glass of neat whisky in his hand . " Drink it , " he ordered . Lynd did . In a few seconds he felt gripes reaching up to him from the soles of his very feet . The pains bent him forward like a hoop . Furies were tearing at his intestines . He seized the big kidneybasin which stood ready on the table beside him . Writhe , writhe , writhe . . . he could not squirm away from these fingers tearing away inside him . He could not empty himself . . . . Finally , he fell back exhausted . Though still burning . Dr. Laybrush who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed and took his pulse . " Splendid , " he said , as if vastly relieved . " Now I 'll leave you . You 're a big man  --  and I did give you the limit . The rest will be slightly smaller  --  but you will feel much worse . . . Oh , much worse . You must be prepared for that . You have three or four days of sheer hell ahead of you . There 's the I j whisky  --  drink as much as you can of it . " " Thanks , I will , " grinned Lynd . He reached for the bottle and poured himself out another half glass . Maybe , he thought secretly , it will kill this pain . But Dr. Laybrush already knew what Lynd was hoping . " No , " he said , " you will not get drunk ? and that is just the hell of it . Here 's Sister  --  Mr. Lynd , Sister ? Good-by . " Lynd was sick again .  | " Ah , " said the little Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of the grand stuff ! " " Have some yourself , " said Lynd . " Not me ! " " Go on , it will do you good . " " The same way it 's doin ' you , I suppose ? " Lynd smiled weakly . This was the third night . He did not know how long he could hold out on this . How long before something would snap inside him . It had been a vortex of horror . But he had got on top of it . That bitter sullenness that had stood him in good stead once or twice before was with him now . As nobody except one of the two nurses could see him , he was not forced to face any weakening sympathy . He was alone . The Irish girl was pretty ; he wondered what she would be like in bed . Why not , he thought . Then he said : " Come on , Sister  --  you 've forgotten ; it 's time you give me another shot in the arm . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he knew that for the next hour he would be writhing like a snake with a broken back . They watched the dawn come . Sister had become sentimental . " When I tuk up nursin ' , " she said , " I said to myself , Now , you are going to be a noble woman  --  a noble woman , mind you . ' But the ithers  --  they just laughed . You wait , ' they said . You wait  --  in a couple of months you 'll be just as hard as the rest of us ! ' Noble woman . . . be damned . . . . " He had no memory whatever of the next day  --  just a blur of vomits , whisky , vomits , whisky . . . and a feeling of sinking .... On the fourth morning he woke up to find the two nurses , the Matron , and Dr. Laybrush standing beside his bed . Laybrush was saying angrily : " Well , you should have called me before . It 's all right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his face pressed so that his nose was down between the bed-clothes and the wall . He could not rise up . " Hello , " he croaked  --  to attract their attention . The Irish nurse put her arm around him and deftly pulled  | him so that he lay face-upwards on his pillows . " It 's all over , " said the Doctor . " Now you are going to have a cup of strong tea . " " Graaand , " Lynd said slowly , then tried to sit up . He had beaten it ! He had n't cracked . And now tea ! He did not know that this first moisture that was to enter his system  --  and was meant to stay there and soak into him  --  was the worst torture of the whole villainous ordeal . He spouted tea like a fire hydrant . Then he collapsed . It was around noon when the room began to take shape again . Dr. Laybrush was speaking to him . " Lie still , " he said . " Sleep . Sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the Irish Sister said : " Well , you were a bloody little hero . You took it foine ! Now , seein ' that you did n't finish that bottle  --  and you 're never , never again going to touch the stuff in your grand life . . . I will have a nip . " " Noble woman ! " smiled Lynd . He patted her leg , but she jumped up . " Look at ' im ! " she said . " One foot in the grave  --  and him trying to seduche me already . I 'll be leavin ' here , Mr. Lynd , before you get well ! " When he did get out , Dr. Laybrush 's parting injunction was : " For two weeks you 'll be as weak as a rag . Do n't try to do anything . " Late that autumn he and Christina went down to the old rough shoot in Somerset again . They tramped the hills , and wore their way through the dying red ferns , and sat on the open slopes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset . Zeppelin thought herself quite a shooting dog now and whined and tugged whenever Lynd went forward to pick up a bird . It was a hunting hotel , with several vast bath-tubs on every  | floor ; and they both reveled in the warm soak at nights before they got into old clothes and went down to dinner . For a few days everything ran smoothly between them  --  then the tension set in again . It began with a call from Flick on the telephone . Chris heard him speaking . That night , when they went up to their room , she said : " What do you want me to do , Peter ? Things ca n't go on this way . " " What way ? " " You know what I mean  --  her . " " I do n't know . " He felt helpless and shrugged his shoulders . " What do you want me to do  --  become a monk or something ? I am made of flesh . And look here , Chris , I give nothing to Flick that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could you ? " she gasped . " Well  --  let 's just be truthful about it . I do n't sleep with you . You know you do n't like it  --  although you 'll say you do now . . . just to please me . . . but that 's awful . . . to do it like that . So what do you want me to do ? " " Anybody , " said Christina desperately . " Anybody else but her . Oh , if only Kyra were here ! " Tony paused . Often , lately , he had been wishing that himself . There was something feverish about Felicity , an eroticism that never left her in peace . It drove her on and on . It had affected him that way too . He was never restful now . Always racing up and down a jagged skyline of emotions . . . a giddy happiness , when he was with her . . . the first few minutes , anyway . . . then either anger or gloom . And lately she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first she had purposely boasted of how free she was with men . Would he ever forget it , that sentence ? " When I feel that I can talk to a man better in bed  --  I get into bed with him . " Now she was trying to retract all that she had said . She had , she insisted , said such things because he made her angry when he tried to criticize her . Now  --  she would rub all of that out . Now  --  she wanted him to leave Christina . He shook his head .  | " Chris , " he said , sitting on her bed . " We ought to have an understanding , you and I. There is more than a facade in you and I sticking together . You 've been the best woman I 've ever met in my life . Now , now , " he smiled , " do n't get angry and say you do n't want to be called a good ' woman . . . but you are good . That is just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  well , I am held by that goodness . Do n't belittle it . You 've often said you wish you could behave like a tart  --  I often wish you could  --  but that 's not you . So . . . let 's keep trying the way we are . . . maybe I 'll see the light and pull around . " " Peter  --  would you mind if I slept with someone ? " " I guess so , " he said . He wished she would . It would make things so much easier . But did he wish that ? " Well , listen , Peter . I think it is better if we live apart . For a time , you know . The Ackworths have asked me to go out to Egypt with them . He 's stationed there this winter . I think I 'll go . I have no spunk just now . " He put his arm around her . That sturdy , gallant little back . But he breathed more freely now . The strain would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for five minutes , " said Patrick Byron . " Not five minutes . " " You mean you would coldly leave a woman who had been faithful to you all these years ? Do n't be idiotic . " " Well , I 've left mine . " " You mean she 's left you . " " Well , do n't go jawing that in my face . I do n't like you . " " Go to the devil  --  with your lousy ideas . " " Listen , old boy , you 've been hitting it up lately . No cure can beat you . "  | " I know it , Freddy . The whole damn thing was based on merely scare-psychology  --  half kill you and then think you 'll be afraid to drink . " " Well , I would  --  the way you are . " " Why , how can you say that ? I have n't been tight since Christina went away . " " No . But you have n't ever been strictly sober , either . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen one or two of the lads go that way . . . just sort of slide out . . . . " " Yes , you 're right . " " And then your nerves , old boy , your nerves  --  you 're like a bundle of worms these days . Christ , it makes me nervous just sitting here with you . " " Well then , get up . To hell with the whole thing . " " Mr. Lynd , " said Marjory , " here 's a cable for you . I do n't think you will like it . " Lynd read : YOUR CABLE TODAY ABSOLUTE NONSENSE STOP RELIABLY INFORMED CIRCLES CLOSEST WHITEHOUSE MY PRIVATE CABLE YOU ACCURATE STATEMENT TRUE SITUATION STOP GET BUSY AND SHOOT US THE REAL DOPE It was signed by the Georgia Senator . " Not nice , is it ? " said Marjory , looking at him anxiously . " Nice ! the little twirp . God , what is he trying to do  --  turn this office into a propaganda bureau ? " Lynd sat down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fine , " he said . " Swell . Yes  --  that is just what I sent ! But this information is supposed to come from close to the President . Does n't matter ? It 's only what the Americans would like to have happen  --  eh ? Well , that 's been my story  --  and now I sticks to it . . . " Marjory , " he said , sitting down at his typewriter , " I 'm  | sending a cable urgent , ' and it 's probably going to get me fired . Senator Twirp , I think , is bucketing in foreign exchange ? or else he 's just a damn ' fool . Probably both . " Whistling slightly , he began to tap the keys . " Why , this is the same thing that you sent this morning ! " exclaimed Marjory as she read the long " urgent " cable . " Three times the ordinary rate ! " " I know it , " said Lynd . " Only this one 's a hell of a lot stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ! " breathed Marjory apprehensively , proud of her American slang . " Coo ! Mr. Lynd , you are a one ! Do you think they really will let you go ? " " Ha-ha . . . Let me go ? Marjory , unless Senator Abner P. Hancock sticks by me I am already out on my ear . " " Mr. Lynd  --  that 's just what I wanted to tell you . Senator Hancock is in Paris ! He telephoned just after you went out for lunch . " Lynd jumped . " Well , buzz off that wire  --  and then you sit firm in your seat , Marjory  --  and watch the fireworks go off . That cable is the straight dope . But it might be my last . " " Paris wants you . " Lynd held the telephone by his bed . " Yes , yes  --  hullo , Senator . " " Tony , issat you ? " " Yes  --  go ahead . " " Well , I just got cable fr 'm Anson an ' he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know , I know  --  go on . . . . " There was a pause and then Lynd heard Miss Salome Svenson speaking : " Good evening , Mr. Lynd , Percival ( so that was what the P. was for ! ) wants me to read you a wire he has just got from Washington . Shall I begin ? " " Go ahead . . . . " Lynd reached for a pencil and his pad but a few words after Miss Salome Svenson started to read the  | cable told him that he had no need to bother ; he had no need to bother ever any more about what the Senator from Georgia sent to Senator Hancock . " Thank you , " said Lynd to Miss Svenson , " that 's all plain enough  --  although it took him a couple of hundred words to say it  --  I 'm fired . " " Just a minute , Mr. Lynd . Percival has been listening on the other ear-piece . He wants to say something to you . " " You 're fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You just sit where you are and leave this to Papa . I like you , Tony  --  you 're the only one in the whole Goddam outfit that has n't tried to kiss my ass . It 's been covered with blisters . Good-night ! " Two days later , Senator Hancock strutted into Lynd 's office like a fighting cock . " Got in last night , " he said . " But I had to eat a meal with some friends at Simpson 's . Business . Say , Tony , you 're not only childish  --  you 're worse than childish  --  to get excited by that wire . " " I was n't excited , " said Lynd . " Did n't have time enough . But it said plain as day that I am fired . " " You ? Hell ! Listen , Tony , I know what he 's doing  --  he thinks he sees a flutter in a stabilization between the dollar and the pound  --  yeah ? Thought so . Well  --  I happen to be bucking it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dope  --  that 's all I want . One of the flimsies I got of your cables in Paris saved me from busting my neck . Anson 's gon na bust his  --  an ' let him . Say , Tony  --  do n't let him bother you ? I can make him cry . " It was cheerful news and Lynd asked about the health of Miss Salome Svenson . " Never better , " said the Senator . He suggested that he and Tony go back to his rooms in the hotel and have a drink . Miss Svenson was out shopping with some friends . " S'pose you wonder why I 'm always skippin ' off over here  | to Yurrup ? Yeah ? Well , Tony , it 's like this  --  it 's no use sitting on my fanny in the Senate . Roosevelt 's got all of ' em with their ears batted down flat . I 've got all the money I want  --  but I ca n't live easy , like I want to , with Miss Svenson . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddam narrow-minded there . Do n't know whether I 've ever told you I 've got a wife ? No ? Well , perhaps the less said about her the better , yes , the less said about that fat bitch the better for everybody . . . . Anybody . . . What was I saying , Tony ? " " Oh , I do n't know . You were just talking about things . Life , in general , I suppose . " " That 's it  --  Life ! Tony  --  I want to live ! Live ! Understand ? Sixty years old and worked every Goddam year of it  --  even when I had the millions pourin ' in . I never lived . Well , Miss Svenson has taught me how to live . Now if you say she loves me for myself alone  --  I ' 11 fire you for it . That is what I used to say myself . But I know better now . " But I 'll tell you what we are , Tony  --  we 're friends now . Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bought her a diamond necklace in Paris  --  paid twenty-five thousand dollars for it . . . . That makes you gasp , does n't it ? Well , I did . And what did Miss Svenson do ? She took it back . She would n't have it ! I spent two whole days and nights trying to make her accept that gift . Nope ! Would n't have it ! Now what do you think ? " Lynd hated to say ; Miss Salome Svenson was cleverer and playing for bigger game than he thought . But he could n't say that . He just nodded . A queer smile came over the Senator 's face  --  a sort of leer at all life . " I know damn well what you 're thinking , " he said ; " she 's playing for the big shot . And now I 'll tell you something . She does n't have to play for the big shot . She 's already got it . I 'm making over to her , while I am in London now , enough sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of her life  --  and I hope it will be a long and happy one . I told her that in Paris when I was fightin ' like  | hell to make her keep that diamond necklace  --  and still she would n't have it . She said there was something wrong  --  it would cut in on our happiness . And she would never feel comfortable in it . Now what do you think ? " " Well , it 's by me , " said Tony . " She must like you . " f " Well , there 's nothing so Goddam extraordinary about that , is there ? " burst the Senator , heated for a moment ; then he gave a fat chuckle . " Old man 's love , Tony . May and December  --  that 's what that fat bitch , my wife 's , always trying to jab into me . Sugar-daddy . . . . Go on . . . . " Lynd felt ashamed . He laughed . " Well , you have got a certain amount of charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " " Atta boy , atta boy  --  you wait till you and I get off in the Ultimate Objective  --  then we 'll show ' em what life is like . I 've a hankering for warm weather . . . and palms . Looka here , " he said , holding up a little piece of painted wood he unlocked carefully from his small bag . " That 's a Le-o-nar-do de Vinkey . . . . That cost twelve thousand dollars . " In a few minutes the Senator 's charm had passed . The bottle of Courvoisier ' 65 was sinking low . " If Miss Svenson do n't come in soon , " said the Senator , " then you and me 'll go off to that other place  --  where we had the lobsters that night . ' Member  --  Grand Duke Dmitri . . . . Haw-haw-haw ! . . . " He was still slapping his leg when Miss Svenson came in . She wore a fortune in furs , and the crisp wind had reddened her healthy cheeks . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends were waiting for her downstairs . " I thought it would be chummy if you and Percival had this first lunch together . " The Senator pinched her cheek : " All right , Baby . Okay by me . " " You go into that bathroom for a moment , " Miss Svenson ordered the Senator . " I want to ask Mr. Lynd 's advice about something . " " Maybe it 's a present ? " said the Senator . " Perhaps , " said Sweetie . When the Senator had gone and loudly slammed the door ,  | Miss Svenson nodded for Lynd to follow her out into the hall . " Do n't let Percival drink today , " she whispered urgently . " I 'll tell you why later  --  but do n't let him drink ! " " I ca n't put him on the wagon . " " No  --  but hold him down . It 's very important ! " " That place we went to , " said Lynd  --  not wishing to face that headwaiter again ? " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club . " " Okay , " said the Senator , as he crawled into Lynd 's car , " you ca n't frighten me ! " " I 've got a lot of work to do this afternoon , " said Lynd , testing him , " so I 'm going to drink nothing but beer . We have some good country brew there . Like that ? " " W-e-11 , " said Senator Hancock ? " if I can have a good dry Martini first . Come to think of it , Tony  --  I 've got a job on hand too . A big one . Drive on , Caesar . " When Lynd dropped him back at the hotel the Senator slapped his back . " We 're going to live , Tony  --  live ! Remember what I told you  --  right before all that gang at the club  --  get that schooner , I 'll give you the money while I 'm here  --  and we 'll call her the Ultimate Objective . Sixty years  --  and now I start to live . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Well , Senator , if I 'm as full of beans as you are at sixty years I 'll think myself lucky . See you tomorrow . " He drove off in the Strand traffic . It was about six o'clock when the bedside ' phone rang the next morning . When Tony took off the receiver he thought there was something wrong with it ; it was making screaming sounds . Then the words came through : " He 's dead ! he 's dead ! he 's dead ! . . . "  | At the hotel Lynd found the Swiss manager already dressed in his neat morning suit and waiting for him . " My God  --  what happened to him ? " said Lynd . The manager put up a pair of soft white hands . " It is very embarrassing . " " Yes  --  but what ? What happened to him ? Was he run over , or what ? When did he die ? " " It was a letter , I think , " said the manager . " I-ie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of jitters that there was nothing to be gained by talking to him . Lynd jumped in the elevator and went up . " Dead . . . dead . . . dead ! . . . " Miss Svenson , lying on the bed with her nightdress torn open , could do nothing but moan . Looking for the Senator , Tony found him dead on the bathroom floor . His legs were cocked , one over the other , like a Russian ballet dancer 's in mid-air , and he wore an idiotic expression of contentment on his face . Lynd closed the door , came back and sat down on the edge of Miss Svenson 's bed . She clutched his hand . " Dead ? . . . " Lynd nodded . He was sitting like that when there was a knock on the door and the man standing there said : " I 'm the doctor who was attending the Senator . May I come in ? " " Could n't we talk in the hall ? " said Lynd . " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the doctor nervously to Miss Svenson . " He had a prostate gland , " the doctor was saying , " but that was not really the cause of his death . As far as I could make out  --  he was very drunk when they sent for me  --  he got a letter yesterday when he came home from lunch ? " " Yes , I dropped him here , " said Lynd . " He had n't been drinking then . . . only a Martini and a couple of pints of mild beer . " " Yes , I know  --  that 's what his  --  Miss Svenson told me . But  | this letter  --  that 's what did the trick . Apparently he found that an old friend he had been doing business with for years had been cheating him all along . It was an awful shock to him . I-le seems to have been a very sentimental man . Miss Svenson kept telling me he had a heart as big as the Atlantic Ocean . Anyway . . . when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar here and got drunk before he even went upstairs . Bartender told me that . Then he drank a full bottle of brandy in his room . Somewhere about that time Miss Svenson came back . She said she could n't do anything with him  --  he was quite demented . They had dinner in their room . The amazing man seems to have eaten a whole broiled lobster . Then he was seen downstairs  --  in his pajamas  --  trying to find the chef and give him five pounds for cooking the lobster . Then he began to get in pain  --  and they sent for me . I gave him a sedative , saw him in bed , and thought he was all right when I left him . " " Could you have saved him ? " " I might , " said the doctor , and then quickly retracted that . " No . He was for it with that prostate gland . " In the next few days Lynd knew he was breaking law after law of strict England . And making the manager break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human vultures descended upon the hotel . Lynd came on them perched on chairs in the foyer ; they tried to go up with him in the same lift ; he found them on the floor of the dead Senator , with a maid or a floor-waiter backed down a corridor , desperately trying to disown that they knew anything about the Senator 's death . At Lynd 's request there had been a reshuffle of the hotel 's domestics ; all the servants on the Senator 's floor had been transferred temporarily to the top floor . The new ones had been told they would lose their jobs if they gave any information about anything to anyone . The hotel was so vast  | that Lynd learned , with surprise , these top floor servants did not even know of the tragedy on the second floor . " But they 're not the Press , " said Lynd to the frightened manager ; " nor are they like the rest of those buzzards sitting out in the foyer now . You know what bad publicity it will be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here come out with : DEATH IN THE . U. S. Senator found dead in bed with a woman who was not his wife . . . . " " Oh , do n't , Mr. Lynd ! . . . " Foreseeing complications , Lynd had had Sweetie change her room a few minutes after he reached the hotel . In a dressing gown Miss Svenson went up a backstairs and into a room directly overhead . All her things were moved up . There , moaning on her bed , ripping open one silk nightgown after another , she might have been in another world  --  so far as the questing vultures down below were concerned . Lynd found he could lie blandly , right and left . He had to . He never went through a period of such tense evasion , deceit , and sheer invention in his life . " Baron Munchausen wo n't be in it ! " he told Freddy Wayson afterwards . Freddy , reading the announcement in the newspapers , had dropped in to offer his condolences . " That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper with his pipe ; " sailor before the mast stuff out in China . . . never been to school . . . sixty million dollars . . . did you give them that ? " " Certainly , " said Lynd . " And it 's true . " " That does n't cut any ice . I might as well tell you , old boy , that there 's another story going the rounds of Fleet Street ? your angel Senator died with a tart in bed . . . . " " Ha ! . . . Tripe ! " said Tony . " Honest ? " " Abso-lutely ! " " Well . . . I can kill that story if you want me to . . . you know how I killed the one about you . . . that police court stuff ? "  | " Indeed I do . But you need n't bother about this one . There 's nothing in it . " Lynd knew Freddy . He would be drinking in the Fleet Street pubs around noon , urging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What of it , old boy  --  it does n't make any difference if it is n't true . . . you can always deny it . " It would be the surest way to make libel-frightened Fleet Street editors throw the story out . A cable from California advised him that the Senator 's lawyer was on the way to London to settle Mr. Hancock 's affairs . He was flying to New York to take the first ship . This was precisely what Tony most wanted . Before the story got into the afternoon newspapers that first day , Lynd had made Sweetie dress , come down , and give him a hurried account of what she knew about the Senator 's clothes , valuables , and correspondence . " Where 's he carry his money  --  the big money ? " " Wallet  --  back pocket , " said Sweetie . " Right , " said Lynd . " You take that . " " There 's his diamond shirt studs and everything ! " screamed Sweetie . " Leave them alone ! " said Lynd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he liked you  --  he 'd like you to have them . " " Listen , " said Lynd . " I 'm not taking even so much as a match out of this room . I 'm going to break the law now ? badly . Every damn law in England before I 'm through . We 'll leave some change in his pockets  --  so that it does n't look as if somebody had rifled him . But you take every pound you find in that wallet  --  all of it  --  I do n't care how much it is . That 's what the Senator would have liked . " Lynd stared desperately at the wardrobe trunks full of new , unworn suits , shoes , drawers packed with silk underwear and the $140 pajamas . " Do take some pajamas , " moaned Miss Svenson . " They 're so sweet ! "  | " Mr. Lynd , you are lying to me , " said a bird-nosed young woman who had come across from Paris . " I know there was a woman with Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about it ? " " Mr. Lynd  --  it will do you no good to keep up this pretense with me . " " Yes ? Mrs. . . . what is your name ? . . . Well , it will do you no good to act the way you have been doing around this hotel . You 'll get the London Coroner on the job before you 're through . You say you 're a great personal friend of Mrs. Hancock 's ? Well , if you do n't stop trying to bribe the concierge and the servants in this hotel , I am going to cable Mrs. Hancock that you are deliberately  --  after being fully warned by me  --  attempting to create a scandal . Good morning . " " I would like to see Senator Hancock 's things . " " You ca n't see Senator Hancock 's things . They are all sealed up or under lock and key . Why do you want to see them ? " " Signor . . . I can not speak such things in public . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you . I was with Mr. Hancock in Italy ; we buy a Leonardo da Vinci pedella  --  yes ? Ah . . . you have seen it ? Yes . Also we buy one veree fine old master . But Mr. Hancock ' e iss afraid of the United States Customs  --  also our own laws against exportation  --  so we paint another picture over it . But I know Mr. Hancock . . . he drink tereebly all time Rome . So I do n't give him real picture ; I get same artist friend mine paint me another one . There ! Upstairs . . . Senator Hancock he got that . Here is real picture . " The sleek young man tapped an innocent-looking roll of paper . " Fine ! " jeered Lynd . " Leave it with me , leave it with the hotel manager  --  we 'll put it with his things . " " No . I want that other one . "  | " Wait a minute , " said Lynd , " I 'm going to call a policeman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drank a Whipley 's cider . " Nothing for me yet , Charley , " he said . " Not until that man I told you about leaves town . " When he returned to the lobby the Italian with the bell trousers was gone . " Mr. Lynd , Trans-Atlantic Telephone Service say your call for the Senator in Washington is coming through at 3 o'clock . " " American or English time ? " " English . Mr. Lynd , Mr. Upjohn of the U.P . was in . He says you 're a damn liar about Senator Hancock . He says he knows there is something fishy about the story you are handing out . He says he is going to find it out  --  if you wo n't tell him . Maybe , he says , he will keep it a secret . " " Ha  --  good old Upjohn . Watch him like a hawk , Marjory . That man is good ! I wish he were n't on the trail . " " Hello , Senator . . . this is Lynd speaking ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London correspondent . Yes . You know the news . Know all of it ? Yes  --  that 's right  --  he did not die alone . Weak voice from Washington : " Oh , my God ! " What I 'm calling you for is this  --  I want carte blanche . . . . What 's that ? . . . Well , a free hand . . . a free hand to do anything , pay anything , and that the vouchers will be sent to you personally  --  and you will pay for them . Voice from Washington : " Do you . . . do you think you can keep this thing out of the newspapers ? . . . " Yes , if you 'll give me a free hand . One voucher will be for a first class fare on the Olympic sailing next Wednesday and a compartment to Los Angeles  --  with unlimited hotel and food bills all along the way . Just the way a certain young person came to Europe . That sounds too much ?  | Let me tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper 's good . It 's what Hancock would have wanted  --  and that 's the only way I 'll go through with it  --  I 've already promised all of that . Is that okay  --  all of it ? Voice from Washington : " Oh , yes , yes , yes . . . anything you like . . . . " I " The dirty little skunk ! " said Lynd to Marjory . " He 's absolutely wetting his pants , he 's in such a funk . I 'll bet he 's got a couple of cuties , too , and does n't want the spotlight turned his way . Buy a ticket , promenade deck , for Miss Svenson on the Olympic  --  get a letter of credit , better get it in U. S. dollars , for two thousand dollars for Miss Salome Svenson , Passport No. 1996342 . Go over to the hotel . . . no , do n't do that , because now that damn Upjohn will spot you . I was going to ask you to go over and sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of a state . I think she really did love the old boy . Funny  --  but there you are . Now he 's dead I think I 've been fond of him all along myself  --  he was such a roughneck ! " " Where is he , Mr. Lynd ? " " He 's over in the London Mortuary Parlor  --  or something like that . Would n't keep otherwise . Carried him down the backstairs last night in a box  --  with a purple cloth draped over it . Regular Roman Emperor ! Man representing this mortuary wanted to bury him here . . . tried to sell me a plot : We bury lots of Americans , ' he said . " " Coo ! Mr. Lynd ! " " What time does the Berengaria get here with that lawyer crook from the U. S. ? Victoria Station  --  around two o'clock next Wednesday . Splendid . " " You 're not getting much sleep , Mr. Lynd . " " No . But I 'm feeling fine  --  have n't had a drink for days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use , " said Upjohn of the U.P . the next day . " You ca n't kid me , Tony  --  I know . "  | " Well , then , if you do  --  shoot . Send your story . Same time I 'll send a wire to Washington , to a certain Senator  --  and tell him to get into touch with your boss in New York . I 'm going to tell him that I have warned you not to send out a story that will do so much damage to so many people in the newspaper world . " " A story 's a story , " grinned Upjohn . " Come on , Lynd  --  kick through . It cost me five pounds . . . but I do know that there was a woman in the Senator 's room when he died . " " Of course there was a woman , " said Lynd suddenly . " Why the hell should n't there be ? Do you think everybody 's a bloody little celibate ? Are you a bloody little celibate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lynd looked toward a far corner . . . . " If you must know the truth . . . and , by God , you are the only one who got on to it . . . Senator Hancock did have a floosie over in Paris . He picked her up in that hairdressing parlor by the Cafe de la Paix . She came over that last night to join him . But when she got here the Senator was so drunk he was no good to her . They had dinner in his room  --  Senator ate a whole lobster . Imagine that  --  with a bottle of brandy inside you ? And then he passed out and she got so alarmed she came down and they got a doctor and the Senator died  --  so what have you ? So there you are , you weasel , send the story . Blacken the old man 's end  --  you ghoul . " " Go on , Tony  --  you know damn well I 've got my own reputation to keep up . And my job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to wire Washington as I promised you . Maybe  --  if you 're too free and easy  --  you wo n't have a job . " " Blackmail ! " " No . Just a word to the wise . Is it sufficient ? " " No , " said Upjohn . Tony gave him a cigarette and shrugged his shoulders . He watched Upjohn push out through the swinging doors . By the time he got back to his office and sat down to write his cable , Lynd realized , Mr. Stanley Upjohn would realize that that  | story of a Paris floosie was not news  --  not , considering the antics of the usual American innocents abroad . But what a story Miss Salome Svenson would have made ! With the American end . . . " No , Sweetie , " said Lynd , " I do n't want anything . Not me ! How much was there in the wallet  --  one hundred and fiftythree pounds ! Well , I 'm glad you 've got that . Here 's a cabin for you on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two came over in . Goddam it , it is bad luck , is n't it ! And here 's a letter of credit for two thousand dollars . That will see you back to Hollywood . God  --  but you 've had a tough break of luck ! I 'm out of luck about my schooner  --  but I always looked on that as just a pipe dream . . . . " " No , it was n't ! " sobbed Miss Svenson . " And my job 's up the spout . Do n't care much now . . . would n't like to work for that other son-of-a-bitch , anyway ? no soul to him . You know , old Hancock did have a soul ! " " Oh , Mr. Lynd , Mr. Lynd . . . I 'll never see him again . Wo n't you let me go over and just look at him ? Please ! " " Absolutely not  --  it 's the worst way to remember him . Think of him in Paris , London , Rome . . . wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a good old boy . Think of him that way . But . . . my God . . . if he 'd only lived a few more days you would have been fixed for life . . . I saw the sketch of his will on the back of an envelope . . . . " " And that necklace ! " shrieked Sweetie . " Yes , he told me that . Tell me  --  it just makes no difference now  --  why did you take that back ? " " Because I loved him . I really did love him . He was so good to me . And I just could n't stand seeing him make a fool of  | himself . Somehow . . . I felt it would n't be normal . . . do you see ? I did n't want him to have doubts about me . " " Yes . . . he 'd have had them  --  if you 'd taken it . " There 's a bill here , " said Lynd , " for twenty men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a woman 's shop ? " " Yes , but Percival always had his clothes made there . . Oh , my God , my God . . . I 'll never see him again ! . . . " " About this wallet , " said Lynd to the hotel manager in his office , " I want to put it back in Mr. Hancock 's satchel . " " But you ca n't , Mr. Lynd . It 's sealed . It will be breaking the law . " " We 've already broken the law enough as it is , " said Lynd . " What about that second doctor who was called in to swear to the circumstances of Mr. Hancock 's death  --  so that we could dodge a coroner 's investigation ? What about that ? And just look at the lies you 've told . " " You made me ! " " Well , open that safe and we 'll stick this wallet back . You sealed it . Put on a new seal . " " Mr. Lynd . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says is a power of attorney from Mr. Hancock 's wife . What shall I do about that ? " " What was it ? Oh , a mere cable . Well , anyone could send that to anyone  --  anyone who wanted to get at Mr. Hancock 's private effects . The woman is outside , you say ? Bring her in . " It was the woman from Paris . " Ho-ho ! You , " said Lynd . The woman had not expected to see Lynd there and started to back out . " Now , " said Lynd , " I am going to act . That cable in your hand means just nothing  --  abso-lutely nothing . Mr. Hancock 's lawyer is half-way across the Atlantic on the Berengaria ? gets here Wednesday . Now " ? to the manager ? " before you let anyone tamper with Mr. Hancock 's affairs  --  telephone Mr.  | Gustaf Olsen on the Berengaria . I 'm sending him a radio right here and now to that effect . " Lynd reached for a pad on the manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the furious woman ; her bird-beak was white at the tip from rage . " You see , " he said , raising his white , Swiss hotel-keeper 's hand ? " I am helpless . " " What is it you 're after ? " said Lynd suddenly to the woman . " Why all this flock of vultures  --  trying to get at Mr. Hancock 's papers ? There 's something shady about this  --  I know somebody , somewhere , has rooked the old man out of a lot of money . Someone he had trusted . Who are you , anyway ? " " I refuse to speak to you ! " said the woman . " Marjory , " said Lynd , " it 's all over . " He sat there and stared at his typewriter . " Olsen got in . I met him at Victoria . First thing he said was : Where is that lousy broad  --  I 'm going to break her so-and-so neck ! ' Mr. Olsen , ' I said , did you pass a big ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute , and then said : Sure ? we passed the Olympic , going out . ' Well  --  she 's on that , ' I said . Senator Hancock awaits you in the London Mortuary Parlor . ' " Lynd got up and fetched a packet of Gold Flakes from his overcoat pocket ; " I 'm only telling you this , Marjory  --  because you 've been in on it all  --  and you 've been very good . Mr. Gustaf Olsen was as drunk as a coot when he slid out of the carriage at Victoria . Worse than old Hancock ever was . I got him drunker . I had to do everything I could to keep him away from that crowd at the hotel . . . they 're still sitting there . . . bloody vultures . " Well , I took him out to my house and got him thoroughly plastered . Then , like a fool , I took him to a revue . He was sitting with his arm around my shoulder , asleep through most of it  --  and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | giving me some nasty looks . Finally , the man with her  --  Regular Army officer bloke  --  leaned across her and hissed : " You will oblige me if you will act like a gentleman ! " I did n't know what to say  --  and then I saw that that old wreck , Olsen , with his arm around my back , had been pinching that girl 's back ! . . . " " Mr. Lynd ! Mr. Olsen was a one ! " " So then I got him out . . . stepping on about a dozen people 's toes . . . and took him to a bar across the street . I told him it was just beer  --  but what he was drinking was half beer and half gin . . . I gave him two pints of it . That settled him . The night porter and I put him to bed . " This morning , " said Lynd , " when I went down to see him ? where do you think he was ? Sitting in a stockbroker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Exchange quotations . At ten o'clock ? Do you know what time it is in New York now ? ' I asked him . He did n't know . Well , it 's just five a.m. , ' I said . . . . " But look here , Marjory  --  here 's the funniest , strangest part of all of it . You know , when Mr. Hancock was here before , and you went over to his hotel to take some dictation  --  you remember the vast wardrobe he had of things . . . and how he was hung with gold chains and elk 's teeth . . . like a Christmas tree ? . . . Well , it was even worse this time . And when I told Sweetie  --  that 's Miss Svenson  --  to take anything she liked from his wardrobe . . . silk scarves . . . anything ? what do you think she took ? " She took six boiled shirts , " said Lynd . " Six shirts for evening dress . And that was all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ? " s s s The late winter of 1933-34 brought Christina back from Egypt , looking bronzed and fit , but with a few gray hairs starting . Tony , who had gone out to Croydon to meet the Paris  | ' plane , had too many drinks while he was waiting for it . Their meeting was not too pleasant . It was not a reunion . In fact , he blessed the existence these days of the fat , very unreliable Freddy Wayson  --  he was always around the house . " I like him , " said Christina , " because he can make me laugh . " Freddy , whose uncontrollable wit had killed any chance of ever getting another permanent job along Fleet Street , was free-lancing and corresponding for some Indian newspapers . Many a night when Lynd came home late  --  after an evening with Flick  --  he saw the ashes of Freddy 's pipe knocked out against the fireplace . Christina , he learned , had been talking to Freddy about things . " What would you say if Chris slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He stared at Freddy Wayson a long time . " By rights , " said Tony , " I suppose I ought to knock you down  --  which , as you know , I can do . " " Not now , old boy , " laughed Freddy . " I 'm too fat . " What I mean is , " said Freddy , jabbing his pipe at Lynd ? " How would you feel ? " " Well , " said Lynd , " in the first place , I do n't think you could make the grade  --  Christina 's too particular . Next , secondly , and finally  --  I do n't think Christina could do it  --  not with anyone . She 's just not built that way . So the question you 're asking , " Lynd continued , " just has no sense in it . But why do you ask it ? " " Because , old boy , I do n't think that if you left Christina she would be half as much cut up about it as you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironic Statue of Liberty , Tony faced New York with the peculiar sensation of a man who , twenty years the wiser , is starting to live over again . Not to waste money he had come over Tourist ; and a German Hitler-refugee who stood beside him along the rail , gasped as he saw the man-made cliffs , with their millions of office windows peering at them from Manhattan Island . " Mein Gott ! It 's Babylon ! " he cried . " Well , " said Tony ; " it may be reward for you . " The German was a playwright , with a new manuscript in his arms ; and Lynd wondered what would be his fate ? a Broadway success , with all the glittering enchantment that can bring ; or the sheer physical pain of merely trying to buy comfort in this most luxurious and cruel city in the world . " New York always scares me , " he told the Jew , " every time I come back to it . " He was glad that no one would meet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he took the train to Washington . No one from the paper , as in the old days , would be there ; it would be a brave man indeed , under the new Caesar , who would identify himself with Lynd before it was known how he and the new boss would get on . Lynd was waiting patiently , like any humble citizen , for his bags to be passed when he felt a strong grip on his arm . It was Bill Draper , his oldest friend in the States . They had gone to the same university , played on the same teams , had a hearty tolerance towards all their contemporaries ; and Bill 's eyes , as they looked into Tony 's , now had an understanding grin . " Well , you old roughneck , " he said quietly . " How did you know I was on the Olympic ? " said Tony equally quiet .  | " My secret service . Do n't think I 'm a politician for nothing , do you ? Wait a minute . " Bill went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an official . " Which are your trunks ? " he asked Lynd . In a few minutes everything was in the back of Bill Draper 's Packard . " That all you got ? " said Bill . " You know me , " laughed Tony . " That 's me entire worldly wealth ! " They drove up the Hudson and over the sky-circling new Washington Bridge into New Jersey , where Bill Draper had his home . It was a white wooden house , Colonial style , on the crest of an empty green hill . Janet , gardening gloves still on her freckled hands , for Bill 's wife was a blazing red-head , came out as she heard the wheels crunching the graveled drive : " Tony ! Tony ! my beloved ! . . . " After he had submitted to being kissed , Janet 's face lighted up with a new thought : " Bill ? do you really have to drive back into town ? Could n't you change your mind and have lunch ? " " hope , Just drove out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Say , Tony , have you any particular fashion in cigarettes ? Will Camels do ? Do n't tell Jan the whole story before I get back . " Bill had asked him no questions on the way out . Neither did Janet when she drove him out to the Country Club for lunch . At the Country Club Janet introduced him to a bevy of young , fashionably dressed women who , in their flowered hats and dresses of gossamer tissue looked brazenly cool when Tony thought of their husbands sweating in New York . The heat of those dirty dock streets still stank in his nostrils . But then , as he reflected , most of their men were probably on the Stock Exchange and were even now sitting down to an unbelievably good lunch in some smart , gay eating place up-town for a twohour chat about golf , sailing , tennis , whatever their favorite pastimes were , and he found himself envying them . The Ameri-  | cans had learned how to live since he had worked in New York . Bill had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untidy costume it would have been as much as an American businessman 's life was worth to wear to the office only a few years back . New York was being at last recognized for what it was in summer , a sweltering tropic city , where the nearest to the original Indian nakedness was the only possible attire . And any time after five these tired businessmen would begin to be met by their lovely wives in the glistening motorcars that now crunched the Country Club drive as he and Janet drank several Bacardi cocktails before they sat down to lunch . The men , out here in New Jersey , would have time enough for at least nine holes of golf , a cool shower bath and a change into a fresh linen suit before they began to mix cocktails in their own homes or drove off to a noisy party somewhere else , and another excellent meal . In all truth , he thought , the New Yorkers certainly had learned how to live since the war  --  not to live in New York ! Janet led him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy friend , Tony Lynd , who 's just got in from London " ? and cut short conversations with one or two of the prettiest women by saying , " Leave that for tonight . You 'll see him there . " He was , he knew then , headed for a dinner party himself , and moaned to the cool Janet , " I 'm going to die in that heavy black dinner jacket ! " " You can wear one of Bill 's white ones , " she said , eyeing him with a slow smile . " I should n't imagine there was very much difference between you in your birthday suits ? " He realized the luxury she was permitting herself , this little game of talking so intimately with Bill 's oldest friend , and he caught himself looking at her with a similar picture in his mind . She must look very neat in a bathing suit . . . and particularly without one . He wondered what their relations were . The picture bothered him and kept coming up before him during lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . " You 're a bad one , Tony Lynd , " she said . " The life you 've led ! . . . "  | She did not mention Christina 's name , but he could sense at once that she knew he and Chris were no longer living together , and she suspected , quite naturally , another woman in the case . She did say Christina had wired he was on that boat . On that cool porch he could have put the situation . It might have done a lot of good to clear the air in his own mind . But , even with Janet , he knew that he could not go into the analysis of his own years of frenzy during which he had been faithful to Chris . There was no reason to discuss Chris . Better let Janet think what she thought . And he could not contemplate discussing Flick . Poor Flick ! After all was said and done , she too had a lot to bear from him . It was true that in the beginning , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with other men , to crucify him , she had purposely wrecked his sense of values because she was jealous of his propriety , his home , his life with Chris , even of poor Zeppelin the dachshund , whom Flick had once deliberately tried to kick . But then , when she had seen him going down the drain , the wreck he was making of himself by the way he drank in London , she had tried to save him . Save him for herself , yes . But no woman could do anything fairer than that  --  dirty as it would be to Chris . At the last talk on the subject he had had with Flick  --  an entire week-end of exhausting , bitter argument ? she had done her level best to make him go off with her right there and then . She would have thrown up everything , run the absolute certainty of her father 's disinheritance  --  the old schemer was determined to marry Felicity into the established English aristocracy . She had not said so , because that was not Flick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if he had not one red cent and had had to begin a new life where he would not even be free to make her his wife . She would incur any stigma . Her courage was absolute , without any reservations or fear for the consequences ; and , despite the wreck he had made of his own life since he had touched and fallen in love with her , he no longer felt angry with Flick for the things she , because of this love , had made him do to himself . He had  | to feel respect for her . It was a good feeling . He wanted it . It somehow made things right that he should feel this admiration for Flick . After all , he was the loser all around . He had protected Chris , because on that fevered week-end he had not let Flick , using all her cleverness , make him do the thing that would smash Christina 's life . Christina would fret and feel wretched the way things were  --  he could not help that  --  but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his going off with Felicity would have given her . It was a hopelessly unsatisfactory situation . This seemed another one of those problems to which there was no answer . And to Felicity he had played one of the dirtiest tricks he had played on any woman . He had made all his plans with a sullen secrecy . The first thing she knew about his going to America was when he had written her from the boat . It had been a necessarily stubborn letter ; and he did not want to remember any of it , except that he told her he intended to be alone . It would be a fake to leave Christina , and then use Flick as a consolation . Their relations , his and Flick 's , were not like that . Flick was not consolation ; Flick was a positive offering in herself . He had refused to let people tear them apart , up to this , simply because he liked being with Flick . He admired her . But to separate from honest Christina also meant a separation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone on this effort he was making . He had done things that way , deliberately played this filthy trick on Flick because , after all , there had always been a certain amount of savageness in their relationship  --  she could take it ; and he counted on her pride . He knew Flick . This was probably the end of her . Looking at Bill 's wife now , Janet seemed only an amateur about life . The thoughts that had heated his blood a few moments back no longer troubled him . He felt cool , unemotional ; and decided he would wear his black dinner jacket that night .
