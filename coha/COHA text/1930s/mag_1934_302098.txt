Over New York City 's far-flung police teletype system one night last week clicked a strange order . Each &; every New York policeman was directed to constitute himself a censor , see that 59 proscribed magazines were henceforth neither exhibited nor sold in the 2.000 licensed newsstands on the city streets . <P> Save for the conscientious Nudist , the forbidden publications were all smut sheets , compendiums of " art studies ' ' bearing such titles as Wild Cherries , Cupid 's Capers , Hollywood Squawks . Heretofore the sale of questionable magazines in New York has been combated with the vague threat of criminal prosecution . But austere little Mayor La Guardia has new ways of doing things . His commissioner of licenses simply announced that anyone in his jurisdiction who was caught selling dirty publications would be put out of business . <P> Promptly to the aid of the Nudist sprang the scrappy Civil Liberties Union . Well aware that the license commissioner 's powers to revoke were entirely discretionary , C. L. U. nevertheless wanted a test case on his powers to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , Nuregal Publishing Co. and Culture Publications , proprietors of eleven of the barred magazines , went to court for a different reason . They asked an injunction against the commissioner 's order on the grounds that he was jeopardizing a thriving business . The smut business has boomed since the Depression because news dealers who once would not handle that sort of stuff will now sell anything which will put a few pennies in the till . It was revealed that of the average 50.000 circulation of the suspect magazines , 10% were sold in New York . Price : 25 a copy , of which the dealer gets 6 , the publisher 11 , the printer 8 . <P> Indignantly declared Merwil 's Publisher Harry Donenfeld , whose line includes La Parce , Gay Parisienne , Spicy Stories , Pep : " Take books like God 's Little Acre and Ulysses . The courts have maintained that there 's nothing obscene in them . They really describe life . <P> " A girl just out of school-she 's the most easily ruined . But after she 's read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's better able to protect herself . "
