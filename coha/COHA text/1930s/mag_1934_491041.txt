B EFORE I relate those events which decided my fate , I want to mention Devonport , that fair sea haven , one with . Plymouth , which was for a short time something of a home to us . This was to be our father 's last naval command ; of ter this be would have reached the top of the ladder and his career as a sailor would be over ; besides , Duke Ernest of Coburg , whose heir he was , was getting very old and at any moment the Duke of Edinburgh might be called to other duties . As a real Englishman , papa dreaded the change which stood ahead of him , for he was thoroughly British in taste and habit , and bitter was the prospect . of expatriation . Devonport was a sort of interlude , and in my own life it stands out as a last taste of all I was soon destined to leave and give up  --  England , home and the beloved navy . Devonport never came up to the enchantment of Malta with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , there was papa and mama , there were many friends , and there was also that beautiful county of Devonshire , so enchanting with its hills and dales , its rivers and forests , its steep roads and high hedges , beautiful gardens and , in places , quite southern vegetation . Owing to our studies at Coburg , we three elder sisters spent less time at Devonport than Sister Baby , from whom mama could never bear to be separated and whom she took with her wherever she was obliged to go ; so my recollections of Devonport are tinged with a certain vagueness . At first we did not much care for Admiralty House . We considered it a very uninteresting house . It looked out upon a wide and equally uninteresting square and it had very little garden to boast ( ) foaly an oblong piece at the back of the building where we used to play quarrelsome games of croquet . Opposite us , stood the house of the general in command . This was a much liner habitation , with a large garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means so much to children and that our garden entirely lacked . Fortunately , General Harrison and his family were most hospitable and welcoming . They had three dough ters , May , Violet and Evelyn , whose ages fitted ours exactly , and with whom we very soon became friends , so that much of our time was spent in their grounds , where , although we were rapidly growing up , wild and romping games were played . The garden overlooked the sea and , if I remember rightly , ended in ramparts . Unforgettable are the excellent teas offered us in the Harrisons ' house when kindly Lady Harrison called us , heated and exhausted by our games , into that coziest of meals which is England 's specialty . This friendship with the Harrison daughters was one of the chief features of our Devonport life . With the eldest daughter , May , who later married a clergyman , I am still in correspondence , but the others have dropped out of my life . Devonport and the surrounding neighborhood seemed to appreciate the presence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father and mother were well loved , and most hearty and courteous hospitality was offered to every one of us . Many , many years later , when , after the war , with my husband , who had become an allied king , we paid an official visit to the country of my birth , Plymouth and Devonport asked me to come amongst them once more and gave me a huge and touching reception in memory of the days when , as one of four happy sisters , I had lived amongst them , blue-eyed , fair-haired and unsophisticated  --  an innocent , uns suspicious little maiden with no knowledge whatever about life . It was a heart-stirring occasion which made me live over again the treasures of the past . I clasped many a rough hand become shaky with age , and looked into more than one eye dimmed by the passing of years , but one and all remembered little Marie , the Sailor Prince 's fair-haired daughter who , at such an early age , had left the beloved old country to go to a foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal . I have a faint remembrance of dinner parties given at Admiralty House , and a clearer one of tea parties in different houses out in the country ; everywhere we were charmingly received , but for all that this part . of my life has remained hazy , probably because of the big event which about that time sealed my fate and which overshadows all the rest . But before this took place , we went once again to Russia , and this time for a very sad reason . Jit Sad Trip to Russia I WAS at Coburg during the autumn of 1891 1 that mama received news of the death of Uncle Paul 's young wife . Grand Duke Paul was the youngest son of Alexander II and our mother 's favorite brother . Hardly three years ago ho had married Alexandra of Greece , eldest daughter of King George and Queen Olga ; and now " Alix " as we all called her , that sweet young wife and mother , was dead . The news came like a thunderbolt . Two lovers , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with their joy . A daughter had then already been born to them and it was at the birth of their second child , little Dimitri , that Alix had died . What a cruel , unnatural event , Alix was dead ! Our guest so recently , that sweet , gay , happy young creature , she was no more . It was unbelievable . Could happiness be so quickly torn asunder and destroyed ? Mama decided on a hasty departure for St. Petersburg , and that Ducky and I , the two eldest daughters , were to go with her . She wanted to be at the funeral , but above all , she wanted to be with the brother she so dearly loved . How well I remember that funeral when young Alix was laid to rest alongside those who had gone before her . She was buried in the great church of the Peter and Paul Fortress where , since Peter the Great , all the Czars and their kith and kin had been interred . The Fortress of Peter and Paul  --  what a sinister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are attached to its name . Tales of crime , fear and suffering to which the Bolshevik reign has added a hundredfold . At the Tombs of the Czars S I DE by side , in impressive rows , under plain , A-long blocks of white marble , lie all those great men and women of the past ; one tomb exactly like the other , austere symbols of how death levels all things ; pomp and glory , joy and pain at an end ; dust to dust . At an end also sin and crime , hope and fear ; each stone guarding its own secret , the secret of those different lives , many of which had ended in unspeakable tragedy . The last . of these was grandpa.pa . There he lay , the size and color of his tomb exactly like all the others  --  heavy white marble plainly engraved with his name  --  and beside him grandmama . She had died a year or two before him , in her bed , a broken-hearted woman , her health all gone to pieces , a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified bearing . Never did her narrow lips open in complaint , no one knew if she was aware of what all the world knew . But he . " le Tsar liUraIeur , " as he had been called , because it was he who liberated the serfs , had been carried to his grave mutilated ; his legs torn from his body by the bomb that the Nihilists had thrown at him whilst he was returning from some ceremony . Two bombs were thrown ; the first had not touched him , but being a brave and also a kindly man , he had stopped his carriage  --  or was it sledge ? ? because , having heard the explosion , he himself wished to see who had been hurt . A second bomb was thrown , and that , for him , was the end of the road . Grandpapa Emperor , mania 's father , a man with liberal ideas who had trusted his people ! It was after his violent death that the era of repression began again , Alexander III considering it dangerous to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the Nihilists ' bomb put an end to Alexander II 's reign , he had been on the point of giving a constitution to his vast empire ; his son , however , did not consider Russia ripe for such innovations . And here we were , all gathered together in this great , gloomy cathedral , to lay a young wife and mother in her untimely grave . Full of the pomp and splendor characteristic of all Russian ceremonies was that funeral . Stupendous chants rose to the vaults , echoing again from the fortresslike walls ; there were thousands of lighted tapers , fumes of incense , and those thundering bass voices of the cantors which always made me hold my breath , wondering how human lungs could sustain such an effort without bursting . Clad in deepest mourning , with long black veils on their heads , stood the . Empress , grand duchesses and princesses , their dull black slashed by the bright ribbons of their respective orders , blue for the Empress , red for the grand duchesses , making their somber apparel appear all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sasha , surrounded by his enormous brothers , cousins and uncles , and as chief mourner , Uncle Paul , a little in front of the others . fl Scene of Royal Mourning r RAILER than his brothers , though just as tall ; and marvelously slim , Uncle Paul was a different . type ; darker and more gentle , he had soft brown eyes and the beautiful hands of his mother . In the white tunic and silver helmet of the Garde a , Cheval , there was indeed something knightlike about him . can not remember if he wore this particular uniform at the funeral , but it was thus that I best remember him  --  long and slim like a slender marble column , with his caressing voice and luminous eyes . A man full of human kindness and understanding , a man who always defended those who were being attacked , who was always fair toward others ; a charming companion , gay and intelligent , it was not astonishing that of all her brothers , mama loved Uncle Paul best . I can still see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife lay with crossed hands against which leaned a small holy image we all had to kiss in turn , and with a thin white veil over her face . I remember the tears running down his cheeks and how Uncle Serge , his favorite brother , took him in his arms when he made a desperate gesture of protest . when at last they laid the coffin lid over the sweet face he had loved . It was indeed a. scene which made a deep impression upon the very young girls that we were then ; the grand setting , the flickering tapers. the flowers , the impressive chants and , above all , the grief of that young husband who had to be torn away from the coffin of his bride . Tout passe . The Strange Fate of Uncle Paul -M ANY years later , Uncle Paul married a lady not of his caste . Morganatic marriages were not sanctioned by the Emperor and it was a long time before Uncle Paul 's wife was received or recognized by the family ; my mother , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who held out longest in protest against her plebeian sister-in-law . The Emperor then  --  Nicholas II  --  even banished his uncle for several years from Russia . Later , however , he was forgiven and his wife was received , but never on an equal footing with the grand duchesses . She was given the title of Princess Paley and was a most . devoted wife , adored by her husband , and she finally made heroic but unsuccessful efforts to rescue him from the hands of the Bolsheviks . Uncle Paul was one of the grand dukes murdered by the Reds in the winter of 1919 , and , strangely enough , he met with his cruel death just within the walls of the Peter and Paul Fortress , close to the church where , so many years ago , he had buried his young wife . How strange indeed and , sometimes , awful is man 's fate . Royal funerals are occasions for great family meetings , of kings and queens , princes and princesses , uncles , aunts , cousins of every degree , local as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years since we had been in Russia , and a few years make a great difference at that early age . We were all growing up and stared at one another shyly , no one wanting to make advances for fear of rebuffs . Young people are not always merciful to one another ; they are nearer Nature than their elders , are inclined to form clans , so that outsiders are occasionally made to feel thoroughly uncomfortable . It was tremendously interesting to meet so many relations , but it . was not an entirely pleasant experience . The boys and young men were inclined to like you too much and the girls were ready to snub you . We were at the horribly self-conscious age when you imagined that every look was a criticism , every word ironical ; you suffered because you were so young , so awkward and completely unable to cope with what uncomfortably resembled a family court of justice . There were large meetings in Cousin Xenia 's rooms . Xenia was Emperor Alexander III 's eldest daughter and a year older than I ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister of poor Alix whom we bad just laid to rest . Having an immense admiration for Xenia , I found her evident preference for Minnie difficult to stand ; besides , ( Continued on Page 63 ) following them if they had kept right on . " Jim , " she said once , " listen . There 's the drum ! " He could not explain what had got into him , for the whole idea was too vague . He was jealous of absolutely nothing , and she was desirable because of nothing he could place . His breath went out in sharp hisses between his Minnie was backed by innumerable brothers of every age . She had not her sister 's good looks , but she was animated , clever , amusing , masterful and rather noisy . There was an irresistible good humor about her , but she also had an exceedingly sharp tongue . Much later in life we became friends , but in those early days I am afraid that we heartily disliked each other , and as none of us was so ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel greatly at a disadvantage . Nor were we able to appreciate her many brothers , for they were decidedly rowdy and there were too many of them ; there were the Greek Georgie , the Greek Nicky , the Greek Andre , and they made us suffer . It was they especially who made us feel outsiders , they were so tremendously possessive and so loud . Another huge family was the one which we called the " Mishels . " These were really a generation older than we were , mama 's first cousins , her Uncle Mishel 's sons . Uncle Misha , as he was known in the family , was grandpapa 's youngest brother and a most kindly old gentleman looking for wives for his many sons and therefore extremely interested in his nieces and grandnieces , and so very kind to them all . There was Nicolas , Misha , Georgie , Sandro , Serge and Alexis . Some were closer in age to mama 's generation , some to ours , but they used to come several strong to these family parties . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest teases ever horn ; they attracted and repulsed you in turns ; you could not ignore them , but at the same time you were slightly afraid ; the " charme Slam " at its wiliest ! You shuddered , but all the same you fell under their spell . Strains That Did Not Blend I have retained a curiously uneasy memory of those family gatherings . Fascinating as was the charm of all those young men , there was , all the same , something slightly uncanny about the Mishel cousins ; a blending of strength and weakness , kindness and a generosity which almost amounted to lavishness , and yet a touch of cruelty somewhere , undefinable , but you sensed that it was there , dormant , hidden beneath their captivating ways . We , too , had Russian blood in us , so we were strongly attracted , but the English side seemed on guard , a little hostile , or , anyhow , watchful , so that we could not blend entirely , nor feel quite at home . And yet I think at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in Russia altogether . But strangely enough , our mother was strongly opposed to any Russian marriages for her daughters . Did she know her family too well ? Who can tell ? Or was it really because she did not want to put before us a religious conflict ? teeth ; he was hot and wet from paddling through rough water away from nothing , and his mind formed noiseless words in the cadence of his stroke : " Get her away  --  away -- away . " Then there was no longer any sound . He was absolutely himself again , once there was no time to think . grandpapa 's days the grand dukes had been allowed to marry Protestant princesses , leaving them free to become Greek Catholics later if their convictions permitted . But Uncle Sasha , who was less liberally inclined , had made severer rules ; whoever married in his time into the imperial family was expected then and there to become Orthodox or the marriage received no imperial sanction . In those days the family spirit ruled supreme . In all royal and imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one dared discuss his decrees or cross his will . That was not so very long ago either ; we have indeed lived to see extraordinary changes . Mama in the Role of Duenna So mama kept a watchful eye over her daughters ; she was quite equal to holding her own , no matter how autocratic her family might be , and she always had her say . She played the governess amongst the unruly younger generation , declaring that they were being brought up without any manners . She never spared her criticisms or caustic remarks , which did not , of course , make her very popular . There were no doubt several little side plays , but of these we knew nothing . Mama had really succeeded in bringing us up as perfect little innocents  --  little idiots we should say today . We took everything for granted and seldom inquired into the whys and wherefores of events going on around us . We were , however , soon torn away from these interesting , if somewhat perplexing , family gatherings , and carried off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Moscow , where poor Mix had died and to which Uncle Paul wished to return . At Ilinsky we were the guests of Ella , the beautiful , and that was supreme enchantment . More lovely than ever in her deep mourning , our feeling for her amounted to a sort of breathless adoration . She was almost too good to be true . Having been Alix 's closest friend , she was heartbroken at her death , and it fell to her share to look after the motherless babies , which she did to the best of her ability till they were grown up , even after Uncle Serge 's violent end . Ilinsky was a delightful place on the banks of a large river , and surrounded by many woods . We were quartered in a cottage annex of the bigger house . It was in the woods , and we loved it , especially as we were allowed to ride to our heart 's content on the excellent sandy ground . There were also wonderful drives and mushroom hunts in the endless woods . We also visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its endless churches , its prodigious Kremlin and by that semi-Asiatic atmosphere which made it so much more THE SATURDAY old Russian than St. Petersburg with all its splendor . Moscow was at that time above all else the City of the Czars . Again let me say , ' 1 Tout passe . " Although thirty-six years have gone by since that event which decided my fate , my pen seems to tremble in my hand when I set about recounting it . It is as though the difficult decision were again put before me . A sort of giddiness comes over me when I but think of it . Perhaps I feel it even more in looking back down the long road of knowledge than 1 did then , at that early age . Now , because I have lived it , I know all too well what it meant , but then I did not , for / was young and foolish and brave , like all beginners of life when they are idealists . The first time I met my future husband was at Wilhelnishehe , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaiser Wilhelm was residing during the Kaiserranaitcer , yearly event of great importance in the Germany of my youth . My Cousin the Kaiser The imperial couple had invited mama to come with her two eldest daughters , although Ducky was then only fifteen and I sixteen  --  indeed , rather an early age to be brought . out into the official world . Our feelings were complex , a mixture of shyness and protest , to which we may , however , add a certain percentage of flattered excitement . We were a bit awkward , no doubt , but though innocents we were not exactly stupid girls . We had always been accustomed to see people and had been brought up to be able to talk in several languages and make ourselves agreeable in any company ; besides , we were gay and full of the joy of life . The only person we knew at Cassel was Prince Friedrich of Hohenzollern  --  King Carol of Rumania 's younger brother  --  general in command in that town , who had been more than once our guest at Coburg. where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sisters had been entirely fascinated by his quiet , friendly manner . Although he had the eagle nose characteristic of the Sigmaringen Hohenzollerns , it was set in a smiling , friendly face which had none of King Carol 's forbidding austerity . " Orikelcher , " as we called him , was really genciiilich  --  the only word which rightly describes him . His voice had a soft drawl that was very attractive , and though not really ironical , he had a twinkle in his eye which put the young at their ease at once . All three sisters had absolutely fallen in love with Oakelchen , and it was a great joy to find him hero at this rather formidable imperial court . Besides , Tarilelien , his wife , whom we mot here for the first time , was just as delightful as her husband . Small , thin and childless , she loved the younger members of her family and knew how to attract them , for she had a very big heart in her diminutive body . There was nothing formal or pompous about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become one of an over-strict and unbending family , they were often a refuge to those weary of formulas and political routine . And on a visit to this uncle and aunt , King Carol of Rumania had sent his nephew and heir , it being considered necessary that he should have a change of atmosphere . He could at the same time follow the Kaisermaniker , which would improve his military science . King Carol never did anything without the very best of ' EVENING POST reasons , Thus it was that we first met at the Kaiser 's table . Kaiser William was our first cousin , his mother , the Empress Frederick , former Princess Royal of Great Britain , being our father 's eldest sister . William was , of course , much older than we were , and though an interesting personality , he was not a favorite cousin . He was no doubt full of good feelings , but his attitude toward his family in general was brusque and at the same time boisterous . He did not exactly intimidate you , but he " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his overloud and deliberately " bourchicose " manner ; you felt all prickly with opposition ; there was something about him that roused antagonism . Empress Augusta Victoria , his wife , was , I believe ; full of the milk of human kindness , a woman of high principles , a good mother , a good and also patient wife ; but her amiability had something condescending about it which never rose to the height of cordiality or ease ; there was effort in it . Somehow her smile seemed glued on ; it was an official smile . But she seconded Germany 's ever-restless ruler with really laudable abnegation , bearing him six sons and one daughter , true to her post , through thick and thin , through good and bad , and with always that smile which she seemed to put on daily with the gorgeous if somewhat tasteless gowns she was fond of , ' a smile that finally , as years advanced , seemed actually carved into her face . Was she ever tired of the eternal round ? Who can tell ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , year in , year out , to the very end  --  a tragic end . All those who go on and on untiringly , whether stone breakers , kings or cooks , awake in me a feeling of admiration ; it is the ceaseless effort , the eternal " same thing " which needs the greatest patience and stamina . These virtues were Augusta Victoria 's to the full . Many years later , when my husband and I were their guests officially at Berlin , her hair was white , but she was still turning on the wheel of her duties . Her smile was as brave and impersonal as it had been in her youth , and , looking at her with a certain involuntary admiration , I suddenly saw her as an automaton , wound up by duty which death alone would unwind . My First Meeting With Nando Much of that visit to Wilhelinshtilie is now hazy , whilst certain unimportant details stand out clearly , such as the mauve color of our festive gowns worn for the big court dinner , and even the orchid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade as my dress , which I pinned on to my shoulder , very proud of this improvement to my attire . I also remember mama 's raised eyebrow when she remarked my affectation , not quite sure if she approved , but letting my little vanity pass as such whilst she impressed upon us how important it was not to be tongue-tied'at dinner . " A princess who does not talk to her neighbor is a nuisance to society , " was one of her maxims . If I remember rightly , I was seated beside the Crown Prince of Rumania on this occasion . He was agood-looking , shy young man who tried to overcome his timidity by laughing . He spoke no English , was evidently very pleased to be in Germany again , and told us nothing about Rumania ; nor did I January 20 , 1934 ask him any questions as to that far-of country , being rather vague about Its place on the map . But both Ducky and I liked this unpretentious young prince who went out of his way to be amiable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orikelchen and Tanlchen Hohenzollern who both were so charming ? Whether the poor young fellow had been told that we were marriageable princesses , I do not know . In those days girls were kept in ignorance of the marriage plots of their parents , but not so the princes , I suppose , as the proposing  --  poor things  --  fell to their share . I wish I could remember more about that visit to Emperor William 's court , but it is a picture that has been effaced. except for the beautiful situation of the Schloss , its splendid , formal gardens and the glorious beech forests which formed its background ; that and my mauve-colored dress , Augusta Victoria 's smile , the young prince 's laughing  --  not to say giggling  --  timidity , and Oakeleheri 's comfortable , drawling voice full of fatherly encouragements . Was it all a plot ? Were they all in it ? I do not know ; that first meeting  --  in my mind , anyhow  --  was without importance . A Childhood Idol Was it in the autumn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit our cousin , the hereditary Princess of Saxe-Meiningen , eldest sister of the Kaiser , at Berlin ? I do not well remember . Anyhow , we three elder sisters were taken there for a week , I think . Charly , as we called our cousin , was an exceedingly fascinating and intelligent woman . For many years she played a large , finally a too large , part in my life . A good deal our senior , though our cousin , she was more mama 's companion than ours . She was often our guest at Coburg . As children we adored her with that fervor young creatures bring to their loving . Like most young married women , she was flattered by our admiration , and she could be more charming than anyone I have ever known . She was small and inclined to be plump  --  a tendency which she always fought , much to the detriment of her health , for she was nearly always ailing  --  and she was one of the few women of those days who wore short hair . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat imitating Queen Alexandra , whom , like everyone else , she much admired . Never have I heard a softer , more melodious voice ; there was a purr in it which would have disarmed an ogre . She was an inveterate smoker and always diffused around her a delicate odor of cigarettes and Hammam . Not really a beauty , her face was most attractive , the lower part having a slight twist , and when she talked the tip of her small and well-shaped nose moved slightly downward . Yes , I remember her every peculiarity , down to the way she laid her fingers over the lid of her precious cigarette case before she opened it , and the way she would tap her cigarette on the table before fitting it into its holder , because once I loved her very dearly , and though she was later no longer my friend , I am still grateful to her for the delight she was to me in those early , unsophisticated days . Each time she arrived at Coburg or at the Rosen an was an occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle , taco 4. those of a cat , like a cat also the soft way she touched things  --  each of her gestures was a caress . She knew many things , though not so many as she gave you to believe ; she spoke always as a connoisseur , be it about horses , music , flowers , cooking or army equipment , and for many long years I bowed down before her superior knowledge , till I discovered what she really was . Amongst her many passions was also that of politics . Capable of lifelong friendships , of generosity and even of abnegation , she was , for all that , one of the most fickle and changeable women I have ever had to do with . Charly in Coburg , Charly in Berlin If I describe this lady so minutely , it is because for many years she played a large part in my life , and not always a happy one . To this fascinating princess our mother took us , following up , I believe , the plan she and Charly had conceived together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was through Charly that mama had got into touch with King Carol and my husband 's parents , who were looking for a wife for their second son , destined one day to be Rumania 's king . Charly , in her own house in Berlin , was quite a different person from Charly , our beloved Coburg guest . Hero she was one of a gay and exceedingly worldly set , and we were too young to have our place amongst such sophisticated company . They all had their own joys , their own mannerisms , their special language , their loves , enthusiasms and abhorrenees . We looked on and suffered the cruelest pangs of jealousy , watching our idol exposing a side of her character we had never before dreamed of ; whilst for us , uninteresting Backfische to whom she had promised a glorious time , she had hardly a word or a look . Bitter disillusion ! That week spent at Charly 's belongs to one of the most painful memories of my young life . The Crown Prince of Rumania was amongst the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we had continued meeting in her house , I do not think that today I should be where I am , for it was only too natural that the grown-up German prince , happy to be back in Berlin , should he much more amused in her exhilarating company than searching for topics of conversation in keeping with our Backfusche innocence . In all countries the smart set is cruel to outsiders , but there was a special flavor about this Berlin atmosphere that Charly and her chic friends spread around them which I remember with acute suffering . Many years later , as grown-up women , when Ducky and I compared notes , living over again our memories of that Berlin visit , tears of resentment still came to our eyes , so acute had been our humiliation and disillusion . But nevertheless , through it all we clung to our love for Cousin Charly , for the young can not shatter their ideals all at once . It needed years entirely to destroy my feeling for her , and even then her soft , purring voice could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sensation of delight she had given me when I was a child . I could see her again arriving at the Rosenau with little presents for us children , filling the quiet house with her delicious perfume of cigarettes and Hamrnam and ravishing our adoring eyes with her lovely clothes and beautiful jewels , because Charly loved jewels almost beyond anything else . THE SATURDAY Only on horseback we could never stand her ; even then her theories and criticizing superiority made a torture of that favorite sport .. Charly belonged to those beings who , with a single word of disdain , could shrivel up your ardent enthusiasm , make your dearest possession appear worthless or rob your closest friend of her charm , and this with a voice soft and gentle like a caress . Charly 's appreciation or depreciation of things was a decree . But . to Charly 's honor let it here be mentioned that toward mama she was , I believe , loyal to the very end . Even after thrones had crumbled and known worlds with their traditions had fallen to pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , Charly , a shadow of her former self , would still go to Coburg to visit my brokenhearted mother , who lived to see the destruction of her kith and kin in Russia , Germany humiliated , and all she believed in torn up by the roots . Finally it was Charly who died a year before my mother  --  died cruelly of the same illness of which both her father and mother had died so many years before . The next meeting with the Crown Prince of Rumania was at Munich . Springtime  --  a feeling of mystery and excitement in the air ! This meeting , I believe , had been carefully arranged , but of course my sisters and I did not know this . We were thrown together as much as possible . My mother combined excursions , drives , the visiting of picture galleries , shops , exhibitions , theaters . Munich is the town of towns for this sort . of thing . The Shy Young Prince The young prince was excruciatingly shy and laughed more than ever to mask his timidity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use most ; there was something so young , so suppressedly eager and just a little helpless about him . It gave you a longing to put him at his ease , to make him comfortable ; it aroused your motherly feelings  --  in fact , you wanted to help him . I was much too young myself to have any positive conception of things ; besides , our education had been according to the ideas of those times . We had been kept in glorious , but I can not help considering dangerous and almost cruel , ignorance of all realities  --  in fact , our education had been based upon nothing but illusions and disillusions and a completely false conception of life . There was , perhaps , a serenity about it which the girls of today will never know , a sort of stupid happiness , but , for all that , it was cruel  --  yes , " cruel " is the only word which really describes it  --  it was a sort of trapping of innocence , a deliberate blinding against life as it truly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have advanced toward any fate . But we were both young , there was love in the air , it was springtime , and mama had a. happy , expectant face . There was a bouquet of pink roses , a little chat near the open window whilst the moon rose slowly above the houses of the town , a hotel room  --  anything but a romantic setting  --  and yet , love in the air . That is about all there is to relate about that Munich meeting , no other remembrance of it remains to me ; a few snatches of conversation without any special interest , a bouquet . of roses and the moon  --  not enough to make a good story ; nevertheless , the beginning of many things . EVENING POST And then a little later , " ins wanderschenen Mapat Mai , " came our engagement , and , of all things , in the Nene Palais at Potsdam , under the approving eye of Kaiser William and beneath the benignly conventional smile of Augusta Victoria , whom the family pleased to call Dona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was , I believe , Charly who had actually led the timid prince up to the crucial moment . How he ever had the courage to propose is today still a mystery to me ; but he did and I accepted  --  I just said " Yes , " as though it had been quits a natural and simple word to say . " Yes , " and with that " Yes " I sealed my fate , opened the door upon life , a long life , the story of which I am setting out to relate ; and to relate as fairly as possible  --  at least , such is my intention . That same evening Kaiser William gave a huge banquet in our honor on the Pfaueninsel , a lovely island in one of the Potsdam lakes . In a characteristically eloquent speech , the Emperor announced our engagement . A setting both regal and military ; champagne , " Hocks " and congratulations . But I remember few details of that festivity . I was excited , believed that I was very happy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a feeling of angoisse which made Duelcy and me clasp hands with something like apprehension . There was already a foretaste of parting , of tearing asunder of beloved ties ; it was a door open upon a future all unknown . All was mysterious , undiscovered land . We hardly knew my future husband , and none of his family except Onkelchen and Trinlchen , and we had once had a glimpse of his father , Furst Leopold of Hohenzollern , one of the most charming men of his time . But Uncle Charles , or Carol , and his far-off country , Rumania . all that was hazy , must not be too clearly thought of or one might become afraid . And above all there was Ducky  --  Ducky , dearest of companions and comrades ; however should we have the courage to part ? Subconsciously I realized that she was full of resentment ; I felt that she could not understand my easy consent , that simpleminded acceptance of an almost unknown man ; in her heart of hearts she disapproved of this " Yes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It meant separation , it meant the beginning of something new in which she would have no part ; we had always shared everything , and now here was something I was not going to , could not , share any longer . That evening we met the first , Rumanian who had ever crossed our path  --  Colonel Coanda , my bridegroom 's A. D. C. ? a tall , amiable , good-looking man in a strange uniform , who was beaming with delight , for the Rumanians were very anxious that their young heir to the throne should marry according to the country 's desire . It seems that a granddaughter of Queen Victoria , a princess whose uncles and cousins sat on many thrones , was just what they all wanted , it was what they called " an beau mariage " ; one which opened out a new future to a still rather unknown country " somewhere in the Near East , " for this , let it be confessed , was how , in those days , we looked upon my now so beloved Rumania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke in French 66 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 20. 1934 and expressed himself with much greater facility than his shy young prince . He found many words in which to tell us how delighted the king and the people of Rumania would be , what a splendid reception they would give the young bride , how beautiful was his country , how romantic the scenery , how picthresque the peasants . He said the people " would carry their future Queen on their hands "  - -  I well remember his using that expression  --  that they would build her a sweet home ; that with her fair hair and blue eyes , she would he considered as a good fairy from beyond the seas . Oh , yes , Colonel Coanda knew how to say pleasant things ; Ducky and I stood hand in hand , listening to him , and visions ? tempting visions ? passed suddenly before our eyes . The times which followed were feverishly full of excitement , a blending of joy , anxiety , apprehension , hope and regret . It was all so sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was all very well saying " yes , " and having a shy , good-looking young man to adore you , but things did not stand still at that . To Sigmaringen on Approval What would papa think about . it ? Papa had not been there at the engagement , and somehow my conscience was not quite easy ; I felt. , almost knew , that papa had had other dreams . And then there was G-randmama Queen  --  she would have to approve of my future husband ; none of her granddaughters married without her approval . We should have to go to Windsor and be inspected  --  a rather formidable ordeal  --  but most weighty of all , there was Onkel Karl , King of Rumania , to face . You could not be long in the company of Ferdinand , Crown Prince of Rumania , without discovering that " der Onkel , " as he called him , loomed almost oppressively large in his life . When he spoke of him , something very like anxiety and not far removed from dread came into his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Der Onkel " was certainly a cold wind to his nephew , rather than a warming flame . It was decided that the first move should be to Sigmaringen , the birthplace and home of the Hohenzollerns , and to Sigmaringen would come Rumania 's ruler , to sanction his nephew 's choice . No doubt the bride probably had been the stern king 's choice , but this I did not know ; I lived in the castle of my illusions and in my happy innocence had no idea that everything had not been the romantic play of chance . So to Sigmaringen we went  --  Sigmaringen , that snug little town so far removed from the wear and tear of large centers , with its superb feudal castle looking down upon it like an eagle enthroned upon a rock . Several centuries old , this ancestral stronghold mirrors its walls and towers in the limpid waters of the Danube . Here but a small stream , quite near its source , it is , nevertheless , the selfsame river which rolls its mighty waters through that far-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon to rule . From west to east , through several lands and over hundreds of miles , it is as art ever-broadening ribbon binding the old home to the new . A curious coincidence , the beginning and the end  --  almost symbolic , in fact , to those who like to ponder over the intricacies of human destinies . Sigmaringen , with its cozy little town nestling like a flock of well-fed geese beneath the shadow of the old castle , was a perfect picture of the Germany of that time ; a self-sufficient , self-sufficing little place , living in happy respect of its Ftirstliche Farnilie which was the center , the pride , the very raison d ' ? tre of the whole country . That first visit to Sigmaringen was all sunshine ; I still remember it with a happy feeling of gratitude . Sadder and less loving times were to follow , but that first glimpse of the lovely place and that first meeting with a family which welcomed me with open arms was all sweetness and warmth . They had all gathered together for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nando and his two brothers , Onkekhen and Tankhcn , and also dear Grandmama Josephine , widow of the late Furst Carl Anton . Carl Anton , Nando 's grandfather , had played an important political part in his day . He was a man of wide views and liberal ideas , in advance of his times . So as to promote Germany 's national unity , on the seventh of December , 1849 , Carl Anton of HohenzollernSigmaringen , in common accord with Friedrich William of HohenzollernHechingen , his cousin , renounced his sovereign rights in favor of the King of Prussia . This renunciation took place with an official ceremony in which the prince released his troops of their oath toward himself , whereupon they were sworn in to Prussia . On accepting the sacrifice made by the elder line of the Hohenzollerns favor of the younger branch , the King of Prussia left sovereign rights to the Furst of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen , including the right of conferring their own house order . Recognizing Carl Anton 's remarkable political abilities as well as his staunch patriotism , the King of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his government , and later lie was named governor of the provinces of Rhine and Westphalia , with residence at Dtisse/dorf . A Page From Rumanian History Toward the end of his life , this energetic prince was lamed and for several years had to be wheeled about in a chair , but his brain remained unclouded and masterful to the end of his days . In fact , I believe he ruled his family with a rod of iron . Of his four sons , Leopold , Charles , Frederick and Anton , it . was certainly Charles who inherited his father 's political ability , and with it his iron will . Anton died a soldier 's death from wounds received at the Battle of So. - down , during the war , in 1866 , between Prussia and Austria . But the eldest son , Leopold , my future father-in-law , has also a curious page in history . In the year 1868 there was a revolution in Spain in which Queen Isabella II was dispossessed of her throne , which was offered to Carl Anton 's eldest son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and son , nor did the King of Prussia look upon it with a friendly eye , fearing complications with France . Spain then offered the throne to Frederick , Carl Anton 's third son ; this also was refused . These categorical refusals were principally due to the feeling of personal friendship existing between Napoleon III and the House of Hohenzollern , ' Carl Anton 's mother had been a Murat. which explains the sympathy between the two families . Political intrigues , however , did not stand still at this , and if those chiefly concerned stuck to their refusal , others had not ceased their underhand machinations . In Spain , the campaign was fostered by Marshal Prim , who , since the Mexican disaster , nursed a grudge against Napoleon III . But in Germany it was Bismarck , that man of iron , who was pursuing his plan of isolating France and surrounding her with enemies . All these underhand intrigues were , however , carefully kept from the knowledge of the two Hohenzollerns till the plan should have ripened . In June , 1870 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King of Prussia , who thereupon called together a family council at Berlin during which , under pressure and much against their will , Carl Anton and his son , Leopold , were finally persuaded to accept Spain 's offer . How a War Began Upon this followed the well-known scenes that those who have studied their history books of that time will probably remember ; though events are moving so quickly and so much has happened since that it is being forgotten . At Ems , old King William , who was taking a cure , on the ninth of July , 1870 , received Benedetti , French Ambassador to Prussia . Benedetti pressed the king to give orders to his relations to refuse the throne of Spain . The king replied that he was not ready to do this unless it was acceptable to Carl Anton and his son . A few days later Benedetti renewed his demand and the king gave the same answer . That same afternoon news was received that Prince Leopold had renounced his claim ; Gramont , French Minister of Foreign Affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . Benedetti asked for a third audience with the king , in which he pleaded for this , and also that the king should make a declaration  --  which he could telegraph to Paris  --  that the king would in future oppose any future candidature of Leopold to the throne of Spain . This the king refused . On the afternoon of the same day , Benedetti asked to be received again . With every form of politeness , the king declined to see him , but those desiring war knew how to make the king 's refusal look like an insult to France , whereupon Benedetti received orders to quit Germany , and Werther , Prussian Ambassador in Paris , was asked to leave France . On July nineteenth the French charge d'affaires in Berlin handed in France 's declaration of war to Germany . Thus had Bismarck pulled the strings according to his deep-laid plot . Many of these incidents may have either been unknown or forgotten ; therefore , whilst speakingof the Hohenzollern family , I thought it useful to bring them back to memory . Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose acceptance or refusal of a throne could promote a great war , for a sweeter , more peace-loving gentleman could not be conceived . It was he who was now the head of the family . He was married to Antonia , Infanta of Portugal , daughter of Queen Maria da Gloria , whose consort was also a prince of Coburg , second cousin of Queen Victoria 's husband . Besides Ferdinand , they had two other sans , William , the elder , and Charles , HI , . younger . William , though a dear , kindhearted fellow , had none of Ferdinand 's good looks ; he was inclined to stoutness , had snub features , and the characteristically eagle nose of the Hohenzollerns was conspicuously absent from his rotund and jovial face . He was full of the milk of human kindness , though none too happily married to a niece of the Empress Elisabeth of Austria . This not very united couple had a two-year-old daughter and two wee twin sons . The daughter is now married to Manuel of Portugal . The Peacock Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no lack of good looks . He had a beautifully slim figure of which he was inordinately proud . In fact , he was inclined to be too pleased with himself and stalked about with something of a peacock 's strut . He considered himself as clever as he was handsome , and I was often astounded at the way he managed to lord it over Ferdinand , who was not only his elder but his superior in every way . A year or two later , Charles , whom the family called Carlo , married his first cousin , Josephine , Princess of Belgium  --  sister of Albert . the King of the Belgians . Accustomed to admire him as a child , she continued to do so all through their married life ; though she , too , was by far his superior . She may have had moments when she realized this , but she never showed it , so his vanity increased with the years in a way most provoking to his family . A greater contrast than the two brothers , Ferdinand and Charles , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unassuming , whilst his milk-fair , wasp-waisted brother was just the contrary , and , into the bargain , Ferdinand was inexplicably humble before his brother 's assumed perfections . But at that first meeting I looked upon them all with uncriticizing eyes , ready to take each man at his own valuation . As I mentioned before , my father-in-law , Furst Leopold , was one of the most charming princes of his day . Clever , cultivated , good-looking , he had something of Ferdinand 's modesty , though he was much less shy and the most perfect- homme du monde . I have never met a more unselfish man . He lived entirely for others , spending his life and energies rushing backward and forward between the different members of his family , wearing himself to pieces over the care he took of his delicate wife and of his adorable , old and very deaf mother , whom he dearly loved . Antonia , or Antoinette , had been one of the great beauties of her time ; one of those old-fashioned , classic-featured beauties whom one associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders sloping , her bands long and delicate , her feet very small and useless . But her figure somehow could not fit in with the clothes of the day ; there was a disproportion between the bust and the legs . The crinoline was missing . Superbly aristocratic , she moved slowly , with a curious swinging of the hips . She loved fine clothes and jewels , and though leading almost an invalid 's life , was always very smartly dressed . For several years already her health ha , d quite broken down , and I never knew her except as an invalid who mixed only at certain hours with the other members of the family . THE SATURDAY Our reception at the station was extremely official . Al though small , the Sigmaringen court was wonderfully well run and even slightly pompous , with a good deal of ceremony . The carriages were perfectly turned out , the horses big and uniformly dark black-brown , the liveries were smart , but with all that there was a Gmnfillichkeit about Sigmaringen which was very charming and which quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adored my father-in-law ; they got on beautifully together , he was so exceedingly amiable and thoughtful and had such perfect manners ; besides , he was highly cultivated , well read and a very expert art connoisseur . All these qualities my mother appreciated to the full . Altogether mama was enchanted with everything , and this aristocratic and yet kindly German family was entirely to her taste . Everybody at Sigmaringen was simple and friendly ; the only one who had any stiffness was Filrstin Antonia , the invalid . Quite the most fascinating member of the family besides Furst Leopold was his charming old mother , a born Princess of Baden . Small and frail , she had exquisite features framed in veils and laces which heightened their delicacy . Her gowns and cloaks were just as they should be . She always wore gloves much too long in the fingers , which she had not had the strength to pull on properly . Being stone-deaf she had expressive little gestures indicating when she had understood your pantomimic conversation ; she liked a good joke and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when amused or pleasantly shocked . Dear old Grand-mama Josephine had the most lovely nose I have ever seen ; it was one of God 's perfections . My Future Mother.in.Latv My future mother-in-law 's looks were a great disappointment . to me . Having heard that she had been a great beauty . I was all eagerness to see her , but I could not reconcile myself to this pale-faced , pale-lipped , Grecian-nosed woman with the too-smallbust and too-long legs . These proportions can occasionally be beautiful , but in her case , the hips being enormous , there was something about her figure which made you feel positively uncomfortable . Had I been older , I would no doubt have understood how handsome her features still were . She was most loving and charmingly kind to me , which I later realized must have been somewhat of an effort , because , being an ardent Catholic , it was a great distress to her to have &Protestant; daughter-in-law . This , however , had not been purely a question of chance . Rumania was a Greek Orthodox country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king should be of their own faith . It had been one of the conditions accepted by King Carol when he became their sovereign , and knowing that a Catholic princess would never submit . to this , he had married a Protestant wife , and , willingly or not , Ferdinand was to do the same . Having found a bride to his taste , he did not grudge the sacrifice he was making , although being more strictly religious than his uncle , he was not sure that he was not endangering his soul , especially as his mother was persuaded that be needed the forgiveness 68 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 20 , 1054 of I he church for having overstepped her decrees . Ferdinand was her favorite son , there was a great affinity of character between the two ; besides , as is often the case , distance had minimized his faults and magnified his good qualities .
