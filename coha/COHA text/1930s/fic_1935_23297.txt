MIRACLE AT CHOLULA A STORY BY GRIFFITH BEEMS ac OUR admirers are going , " Gail I Morton said , glancing from time to time across the patio . She was paring a mango . Her husband sat with his back deliberately to the party of American women in the hotel portales . " Their tour director is stowing them in the cars . There -- one looked back  --  several did . The one you called potato-puss looked . You treated them very badly last night . You might have at least smiled . " " I did n't dare smile , " he gibed . " If I had relaxed sufficiently to smile I should have lost control and roared in their faces . They were the scrubbiest herd of females we 've encountered yet . " The demands of an assistant professorship in history had made W. Pierce Morton 's voice capable of bite ; he was forthright and scorning . " They come down here entirely unprepared  --  never crack a book ? and try to understand Mexico with terms like ' color , ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The female of boobus Americanus is a maniac on the subject of romance . Then they travel about in shiny new cars , leaving the tour director to manage everything , and achieve the sensation of enjoying themselves by going gaga and googoo and slopslop and drip-drip over everything . It 's disgusting . " " The poor things . You 're too hard . They probably had n't seen a nice virile blond young American male in weeks . " Pierce was laughing at his own invective . He had a cloven muscular dimple on each side of his mouth , and these lines when he laughed , with his size , assured shoulders , lean chin , and closely brushed blond hair , gave him an air of impudence and force . He maintained his set laughing expression ? " going handsome " Gail called it when she teased him  --  and she smiled , indulgently because he belonged to her , moderately because the ramifications of his scorn no longer surprised her . " Exactly , " he announced with force . " I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on their tour director . He 's paid for it . I want the people about me to be intelligent . It 's nauseating , " he beamed , " to think of the hashed-up blah about Indians , volcanoes , et cetera that 's sloshing round in those women 's minds . When Gruening says that in Mexico you have a primitive religion , a Pretorian army , a medieval church , handicraft folkways , fifty languages , all complicated with twentieth-century intrusions , and that the time element is the transcendent factor in understanding the country , he gives you formulae for reducing Mexico to assimilable proportions . But do those women know that ? Of course not . " He tore a sugared bun in halves for emphasis and licked his fingers . " I 'm going at Mexico in the right way . I prepared myself beforehand and now I 'm trying to be born over again a Mexican , to identify myself with the Mexican , to eat , live , think , believe Mexican , to understand Mexico from within . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're eating mangoes and drinking chocolate frothed with cinnamon this morning . And that 's why ? " Gail wished that he would not so often make her feel like an audience . Consequently she interrupted perversely , " I like Mexican chocolate . " " I 'm serious . That 's why we 're walking . We 'll learn more about the Mexican countryside this morning in three hours afoot on the back roads between here and Cholula than those biddies will in three weeks in their shining motorcade . Cholula will be exciting . Call it a sociological field trip if you like . Are you up on Cholula ? Want me to tell you about it ? " Gail sat up , folded her hands in her lap , and blinked her eyes like a bright pupil whose moment has come . " The great pyramid or teocalli is there , " she recited . " It 's pre-Aztec and so old that no one knows who built it and it was dedicated to Quetzalcoatl , who lived there for twenty years after fleeing the valley of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of serpent skins . " Ignoring Pierce 's dismay , she seized fresh breath . " When Cortes came he feasted with the Cholulans for two days and on the third he massacred six thousand . For every Cholulan temple , hundreds of them , the Spaniards built a church , hundreds of them  --  there 's one on top of the great pyramid  --  so when the Indians went on worshipping their god at the old stand they worshipped ours too , willyfilly . It seems like a fraud , does n't it ? " " Where did you /earn all that ? " Pierce demanded disapprovingly , the cloven dimples distorting his face . " Have you been reading the guidebook ? " " I peeked . " " You did n't need to . I read it I 'd have told you . " " I 'm sure you would , darling . " " How high is Puebla above sea level ? " " I do n't know , darling . " " The principal thing to-day is going to be a view of Popocatepetl , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Puebla , as you ought to know , is 7,100 feet above sea level and Popo is exactly 17,794 feet , so Popo will rise high before us in full view from stem to stern . " " Unless ? " Gail put in defiantly . She did not believe in knuckling under entirely and there always had been clouds . " There will not be clouds , " Pierce asserted firmly . Immediately after breakfast they started . Pierce wore a pink-and-lilac sombrero , checked Norfolk jacket , slacks , and plaited leather shoes . Gail called him a sartorial halfbreed . She knew the points on which he would accept teasing . Over his left shoulder , slung Indian fashion , he bore a redand-violet maguey bag containing their lunch : chicken sandwiches , mangoes , bananas , and two bottles of beer . Gail carried the guidebook . The hardworn , much scuffed yellow cannon for Cholula was standing in the market : In twenty minutes it had filled ; the helper cranked , and it went off with a lurch , jolt , and rattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a baby slung in her rebozo , an olla of coarse meal , and a boy who sat on the floor by Pierce 's feet , peeling and chewing a stick of sugarcane . The baby sucked a roasted ear of dark green corn and down over his head , past eyes and ears , hung a man 's cap . Gail lifted the cap and smiled at the baby . She wished that MIRACLE AT CHOLULA she could speak Spanish , like Pierce . " Nino , " she said , fluttering her fingers at the baby , " nitio . " The mother tightened her rebozo and smiled ; the baby stared and stopped eating and almost at once fell asleep ; the cap fell over his eyes again , and the ear of corn rolled across Gail 's lap to the camion floor . At the side road to San Francisco Acatepec they got down from the camion . Passing beyond a cement factory they came out on the plain of Cholula . Pierce reached in his pocket and put on his sunglasses . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paling the mesa to a gray-green dryness like that of adobe and hardy corn . Gail slowly turned once round in the beaten clay road . It makes one feel like nothing at all , she thought . In every direction the plain reached to cloud-white , distance  --  blue mountains . In the near distance , six miles away , they saw the steep green pyramidal hill of Cholula , like an unerodibk crag in the flat plain , and on the green crag the white gleam of the church of Nuestra Sefiora de los Remedios . Beyond the pyramid , thirty miles farther , heaped a quarter of the way to the meridian , stayed the clouds , great ponderous cumuli , solid and slow and white as glaciers . Underneath the clouds they recognized the long lavender-shaded bases of Popocatepeti and Ix taccihuatl . Pierce squinted encouragingly through his glasses at the high sun and changed the maguey bag to his other shoulder . " The clouds will move away from Popo when the sun gets at them , " he insisted . By the time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had walked three miles . Across the fields , several miles to the west , rose the hill of Cholula , and they were near enough now to make out thepoblano domes and pointed belfries of the church . Pierce complained that lugging two bottles of beer was heroic , considering the altitude , and they decided to give up the church at San Francisco Acatepec and by leaving the road to come more shortly to the great pyramid . The country was divided into rectangles by wide lanes through the corn and they struck down the nearest lane westward . They passed farms and villages of adobe , with melons set to ripen on the red tiled roofs , orchards of sweet lime and ciruela , and dahlia gardens fenced with wattled cornstalks . A white turkey-cock came out of the cornfield followed by three hens . He stopped and swelled , his head drew back like a charmed snake , he ruffled his wings and spread his tail and strutted along the magueys , seeking an opening large enough for him to reenter the corn with undiminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weeds and ate . " The male , " Gail cried , seizing on Pierce and giggling . She hardly came to his shoulder . " Illustrating how splendid the sex may become when not frustrated and inhibited by monogamy . " " Rubbish . Did you notice that splendid Mexican baby in the camion ? Was n't he fine ? " " Probably illegitimate . Seventy per cent ? " " I do n't want to hear , " Gail said . " What 's that ? " Dashing across the lane she picked up a burro 's shoe . The shoe was worn thin , the caulks worn away and , compared to a horseshoe , it looked fragile and tiny and reminded Gail of the burros ' small delicate legs following one after another under burdens with a patience Pike water drip-drip-dripping . " Good luck , " she cried and tossed the shoe over her left shoulder . " I 'm making a wish but I 'm not telling you what it is . " " The babies down here are weaned on pulque , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for drunken-ness . " " The trouble is that a baby nonpluses you . I 've seen it . " " Not at all . Unlike most people , I remain intelligent when confronted with a baby , as well as with everything else . They are all very well , but anyone can have them . The difficult thing is not to have them . That requires intelligence . They 're valuable , I should say , to people who have no hope of accomplishing anything else in the world  --  consolation prizes , so to speak , for the unambitious and the failures . " " Rubbish , " Gail said . " Do n't try to tell me that that is being intelligent . People have babies because they want them . And they want them because there 's a certain us-ness about having a baby , and as people mature they want to be involved in something greater than themselves . " " Now , now , " Pierce objected sarcastically . " Please do n't go mystical on me . That Mexican woman did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She had it just as a cow drops her calf . " " I do n't call that being sympathetic with the Mexicans . You are n't identifying yourself with them very much right now . " " You mean I 'm not identifying myself with you , " Pierce said . " I understand you too , you know . At the sight of a baby you 're as full of maternity as a pear is of juice . " " I suppose that 's disgusting . " " Not at all . I like you for it . You need n't worry as to that . " Gail forbore answering him . After a while Pierce touched her arm . " Look , " he pointed . " Look there . What did I tell you ? " High above the plain , twice as high as Gail had expected , a minor rift had opened in the clouds and across the rift , uncertain as a mirage , they saw a straight acutely slanting line . The line was of a straightness impossible to clouds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south arete of Popocatepetl . Without a word they crossed the road and sat down on the bank of an irrigation ditch . The massy wall of cloud that overhung the mountain to its base and cast broad shadows outward on the plain had not changed ; it stayed , invincibly hiding the magnitude of the mountain ; but as they watched , the rift , opening higher , uncovered the peak and then the northern slope , and in the dissolving aperture of cloud , like another cloud of forceful azure delineations , appeared the snowcapped cone of the volcano . It rose icily pure and serene in its ethereal vantage , and as Gail watched her annoyance with Pierce died and she was subdued by an awed peace . The cone became more distinct ; they saw radial crevasses scoring the snowcap ; neither smoke nor steam issued from the crater ; the volcano rose icebound two miles above the plain . Ixtaccihuatl remained hidden in the clouds . " It 's like a dream , " Gail said , " so high and blue and pointing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looks small enough but actually it 's two and one-half miles in circumference . The sulphur fumes that come up ruin an ordinary photographic plate . " " It makes you feel very solemn , does n't it ? It makes you want to wonder about heaven and life after death and all that sort of thing . " " I hope not , " Pierce said . " Life after death is no problem any more . Look there . You see those black specks circling against the lower clouds ? They 're zopilotes  --  carrion buzzards  --  and they 're the answer to that . Anyone who is n't a throwback to the dark ages has the courage nowadays to recognize that there never seriously was a problem as to personal immortality . The serious problems for a truly modern man center around the control and direction of the course of history . " " Let 's not talk , " Gail said , annoyed to find herself staring at the blackening maguey leaves which had been slashed and left to rot by the roadside in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at Popo . " " I think I 'll climb it , " Pierce said . She no longer listened . She lay with her hands beneath her head , comparing the volcano to an inverted morning-glory and closing her eyes in order to open them again on the amazing reality . So unapproachable , she thought , so pure --  Gail started . With a maguey spike Pierce had pricked her through her sweater . " Come out of it . Do you want to climb Popo ? " " This afternoon ? " " Certainly not , little doodlehead . It takes two days and you start from the other side of the mountain at Ameca-meca . " " Climbing the pyramid at Cholula will do me . " " Popo would be an adventure and I could report on it at the faculty club . " Pierce lay back , impressively large and lazy , and closed his eyes . " just think , " he said , " what applied agrobiology would do for this valley . Modern irrigation .. . " While they rested there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another , and looking in the direction of the sound they saw two white puffs disintegrating in the air above the pyramid . Six more rockets followed . The smoke lingered in the air like shaken handkerchiefs . Occasionally and faintly on the wind they heard band music . " This crazy country , " Pierce grumbled . " Come on . A fiesta has broken loose . " He resumed the weight of the two bottles of beer without a word of further complaint , and they hurried toward the pyramid . They saw Indians straggling down the hill and soon met them in the field lanes . The rockets had been the climax ; the fiesta was ending . They raced up the grassgrown bank of the pyramid to the first terrace , but the second bank was high and steep . Bushes and pepper trees grew over the hill . They climbed up a rain-washed path that came out by an old ash tree on the paved ramp leading up from the city of Cholula . The descending Indians were in holiday clothes . While the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments . The paved ramp ended in a cherimoya thicket at the foot of a flight of steep black stairs . Gail and Pierce were panting from exertion and they leaned on the broken parapet to rest before the final ascent . " I 'm puffing like an old man , " Pierce said . " No , gracias , no , no , no , " he insisted to an Indian boy in a pink shirt . The boy 's fleshy nose was shaped like a parrot 's . " A bsolutamen le , no . " The boy exhibited successively an obsidian arrowhead , a handful of tiny clay heads , and a pack of post cards . " No , " he said to a second smaller boy in overalls who begged to wear his sunglasses . " Veree beautiful , " the parrot-nosed boy said , running over his post cards admiringly . " Excavacione.s ? Mummies ? " " No , " Pierce said . The boy took a rag from inside his blouse and , untying it , held up to Gail three raw fledgling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs , one at a time , with a bottle of tepache in his hand . " No , " Pierce said . The steps were narrow and built of black sharp-edged basalt and at the stairs ' head , on a pedestal , stood a stone cross . Beyond the stairs appeared the belfries of the church , the bells lodged over-joyously upright at the top of their swing , and still higher , a steel framework , raised above church and hill and countryside , supported an electrically lighted steel cross . Pierce and Gail went up the steep stairs sideways , a step at a time . A middle-aged Indian woman sat motionlessly , her hands in her rebozo , at a table in the shade beside the church door . From the edge of the table bunches of consecrated candles dangled by their wicks . The white walls of the church shone in the intense afternoon sunlight , and in the paved courtyard , in an evenly spaced row in front of the church , were four cypresses , a crooked lime tree , a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench by the balustrade and ate their lunch . From the plain below came up the faint sweet pealing of church bells . Pierce put down his empty beer bottle . " I 've still got a touch of altitude , " he remarked . " The sights can go hang . I 'm going to lie down and take a nap . " " Are n't you going to look inside the church ? " " Bother the church . The guidebook says the interior is n't worth looking at . Probably a crucified Christ , half a dozen painted saints with cobwebs growing between their uplifted palms , and at least fifty collection boxes . Superstition always disgusts me and I 'm too tired to risk being disgusted . My heart is going like a triphammer as it is . You like such things . You go look at them . I 'm going to stretch out and digest . " Gail looked at the panorama , west , north , east , and south , gazing in turn from the balustrade on each side . The teocalli rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction at the horizon were the mountains like greater islands . Popocatepe tl now was naked of clouds down to the saddle of Ahualco . Between the teocalli and the mountains , underneath the waste of mesa air , stretched the gray-green plain like the bottom of a sea in which , transparently maintained , lay the squares and azoteas of Choluia , the rectangles of the milpas , the long line of trees that were roads , the red tile and adobe of the farther villages , and , scattered everywhere like shells , the campaniles and domes of churches from which recurred faintly again and again the chiming of bells . On the balustrade on which she leaned tourists had scratched their names , and not far from her a gray lizard cocked his head and clung to the walls . " ' The lion and the lizard keep the court where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep , " she whispered , acknowledging her own insignificance in the turning of the centuries . How appropriate it was , she thought , the ancient belief that the god of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leaning on the balustrade , she recalled a story that Pierce had told her that morning : four hundred years before , while Cortes was massacring the Cholulans and the Spaniards were storming the very pyramid underneath her feet , the priests of Quetzalcoatl in their extremity wrenched stones from the top of the teocalli , expecting the god to issue forth as an inundation and overwhelm the invaders . Nothing had come forth from the dislocated stones save dust . If only , she thought , there were some correspondence between splendid and majestic things and a power in men 's lives . If only the pyramid , or even more , Popo , when men besought them . would reply as became them , instead of answering no more than did the commonest stones . The immobile woman at the church door did not look up from her table of rosaries , scapulars , ex-votos , and prayers as Gail passed and entered the church . The interior was decorated with light-blue streamers in celebration of the Assumption . Across the floor flower petals from the fiesta had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue military breeches dragging round his bare heels , was sweeping . Methodically he whipped a long dampened rag tied to a stick across the floor . Gail walked to the front of the church and amused herself by examining the silver arms , legs , heads , hearts , babies , pigs , and burros pinned as exvotos on a red velvet curtain . The image of Nuestra Senora de los Remedios , no larger than a doll , with tiny white Spanish face and the conically disposed embroidered vestments of a seventeenth-century infanta , was above the altar . She stood in a golden bowl with the crescent moon at her feet and beneath her a serpent engirdling a sphere . When Gail came out , Pierce was lying on the stone seat with the maguey bag and the two beer bottles under his head . He looked very large and foreign lying there . The Indian boys , sitting in a row in the long slender shade laid by the cypress , were watching him . The pink-and-lilac sombrero had fallen on the flagging . " Here you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaths . His calmness , contrasting with the strenuousness of his breathing , alarmed Gail . She squeezed onto the bench beside him . The dark glasses over his eyes made him seem withdrawn and hidden from her . The dimples lay inanimate like scars . His mouth stayed open . " I should n't  --  have eaten  --  without resting , " he panted , and after several breaths , " It 's altitude . " Gail fought against her alarm . " Let 's see , " she said cheerfully , taking his wrist . The pulse raced so fast and strong that she had the sensation ofhearing the pulse beats . She dropped the wrist , startled . " Like horses going to a fire , " Pierce brought out , smiling mirthlessly . " I tried it myself . " " It 's nothing , " she said , frightened , looking around her . The children had come closer and stood a few feet away , watching . A dog came after them and lay down in the shadow of the balustrade . " El senor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierce moved but made no answer ; Gail did not understand . The foreignness of the words seemed to draw a tight ring about them . Imperturbably the woman by the church door watched . Kneeling , Gail laid her head on Pierce 's breast and listened to her husband 's heart . It beat by her ear like a mawl striking blow after blow in rough mechanic labor , and she could feel the ribs lifting , expanding , reaching and reaching as if to grow large , larger with every gasp . The laboring of his heart and lungs held her . They lived for themselves , laboring powerfully , as though the Pierce that she knew had been discarded and did not matter . She was alone with the heart and lungs and she listened for what seemed a long time because she was afraid to let Pierce see her face . Then she stood up hurriedly and stood beyond him out of reach of his eyes . Below her a camion lurched out of Cholula on its way to Puebla . A running man swung himself onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to do something , to act . Under the dark glasses Pierce 's eyes were closed . She beckoned to the Indian woman . " My husband is sick . Help . Understand ? Help . How can I ? " The woman slipped her rebozo half back from her gray thick hair and listened attentively . " Si , " she said shaking her head . " Si . " Gail seized the woman angrily and pulled her to Pierce . " Listen , " she ordered , pointing to the woman 's ear and tipping her own head in a hearkening attitude . She laid her head on Pierce 's breast . " Listen , " she ordered . " Heart , " Gail gestured with her hands over her own frightened one . " Heart . " The Indian woman bent over Pierce , laid her red glass earring against his shirt and listened . " Muy rapido , " she said , more to the three boys than to Gail . " Muy rapido . " " El senor tiene el pelo Blanco , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pavement and holding it respectfully . Pierce by an effort sat up . His head and shoulders swayed forward with every gasp . " Send her away , " he scowled . He swung his hand in a weak pettish gesture " I do n't want her . I want to get down off this damned place . I want to get away from here . I do n't like it . Bring the things , " he said , pushing away Gail 's arm . " Leave me alone . " He stood up stiffly and walked stiffly to the head of the stairs . He looked down the steep flight , hesitated , looked round him on every side and , putting out his hand , sidled to the pedestal which upheld the stone cross at the stairs ' head . He held himself steady and upright beside the cross and stared down at the cruel black edges of the precipitous steps . They waited , step below step , edge below edge and , turning away , he leaned for several minutes on the pedestal . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench . He stumbled over the dog lying in the shade of the balustrade , which yelped sharply , and Gail caught and helped him as he sank down on the bench . " Get a doctor , " he whispered . " Get a doctor . " The dog lay down again with a long whine . Unexpectedly Pierce jerked his hand to his throatand tore loose his necktie and the top button of his shirt . Gail screamed and trembled . Under the skin of his throat the jugular throbbed like a stick beating against the neck from within . She wanted to grasp the jugular and press it firmly into place and she prayed for it to be still , and as she besought him , she saw the fear flood into his eyes ; he was trying to escape , he was struggling . As in a nightmare she watched him , saw the chipped balustrade , the contorted eyes , behind him the miles of blue air and the mountains . She broke from the nightmare and held him fiercely in her arms . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He struggled with her . " I 'm afraid , " he sobbed , " I 'm afraid . Get a doctor . I want a doctor . I want a doctor . A doctor . " " Get a doctor , " Gail screamed at the Indian woman . " Get a doctor , " she screamed , beating the woman on the shoulders . " Telephone . Get a doctor . " Suddenly she remembered a Spanish word by which Pierce had said to call for help if they were ever attacked by bandits . " Socorro , " she cried , " socorro . " " Si , " the woman said , " si . " She turned and walked quickly into the church . Gail doubted painfully whether the woman understood . The oppression of helplessness and an implacable remoteness dragged at her like an undertow . " Do something , " Pierce sobbed . " Something . " Half erect , he lurched with every gasp . The woman had disappeared . Searching over the face of the church , Gail 's eyes came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electric-light bulbs . The recognition was like a firmly spoken reassuring word . " Look , " she cried , gripping Pierce 's head and turning it , turning the eyes , " look , " she pointed . " Do n't you see . The cross . " Tears started and she no longer doubted the woman . " Electric lights . Do n't you see ? It 's all right . Do n't be afraid . Do n't be afraid any more . They have electric lights . There 'll be a telephone . She 's gone to telephone . We 'll have a doctor here as fast as one can come from Puebla . Everything is going to be all right . " She forced him to lie down and she leaned close over him looking into his face , crying and smiling . " Lie quiet . Do n't be afraid . There 's a telephone . He 'll come . Do n't be afraid any more . " She removed her sweater and placed it underneath his head and , stroking his hands , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as if he were a child . She was no longer afraid . She knew that the doctor would come and that Pierce would not die . She was calm and assured and she looked down on the limp white face beside her with aching tenderness and a strength that every moment became stronger . The strength within her was great enough to sustain him until the doctor came . She spoke to him , saying over and over again the same soothing words and reflecting , even as she spoke , that they had met the first major experience of their united lives . They had met death together . She had seen Pierce open and revealed and quivering , and she was glad that he had been afraid . She had seen beneath his arrogance , his air of force , his delight in himself , and seen so closely that he could never deny the part of him that she had seen , the terrified true self , and she was tender because he had been afraid and they were bound together by it . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight , she had longed , an experience that would mature Pierce , would melt away his insulating egotisms and unite them to each other . She was happy as she stroked his hand and said over andover again , " The doctor will come . Do n't be afraid . The doctor will come soon . " Pierce 's breathing became more even . He lay with his eyes closed , breathing deeply and regularly . Beyond the balustrade Popocatepetl established itself , solid and almost familiarly everlasting , above the changing clouds , and far oil underneath the clouds the zopilotes still were circling and blowing like dead sparks . Half an hour went by . Against the silence , Pierce finally spoke . " I ought to have a son , " he said , the words rising out of the hidden flowing of his thoughts , " I might have died just now . " She was startled and stopped stroking his hands . She looked at the dark glasses hiding his eyes , the lax dimples , and at his hands which lay as she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness that she had stroked or ceased to stroke them . " We , " she said softly . " I could n't get my breath . Something happens to the air . You breathe and breathe and nothing comes of it . " She could see that he was better . " You just about scared me to death , let me tell you  --  I mean that literally  --  the way you carried on : ' " I did n't mean to . " Pierce sat up and tested his body . The rest had restored him . He got carefully to his feet and took several steps . " I can make it if I have to , " he said , sitting down again . " I never knew I had a heart before . What 's become of that woman ? We ca n't wait too long for the doctor ; it 's going to rain . " To the north the afternoon storm-clouds were advancing , already loosening from their black level edges a violent mist of rain across far Tlaxcala . They were perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman . The woman and the boy came out of the church together smiling . " El senor estii me jar , " the woman said , her face beaming with pride . " Es un miraculo . " Pierce abruptly demanded of her when the doctor would arrive . The woman shrugged and smiled . " El medico ? " she shook her hands , palms outward , despitefully . " No , senor . Es un miraculo . " " Te/Oono ? " he persisted . " Hay telOf one en la iglesia ? Si ? " " Telefono ? " the woman repeated puzzled . " No telefono . " " She 's too stupid to live . What have you been doing in there ? " he demanded in Spanish . The tone of his voice informed the woman . She suddenly understood . The gleam of pride vanished from her face and she spoke rapidly , vehemently , volubly . " Slowly , " Pierce interrupted , " despacio , " but she gave no heed to him . Her words rushed on with accumulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly about her head , turned abruptly away and left them . " Cuidense , " she said violently to the three boys . " Son animates . Son ateos . Son gringos . Gringos brutos , " crossing herself protestingly . " The useless old fool . As near as I can make out there is n't any telephone , she did n't know we wanted a doctor , and all the time we were depending on her to get one she was in there praying on her knees before the most blessed Virgin of the Remedies , and her prayers have been answered and she is n't at all surprised because this is a very holy place and most powerful in miracles , and apparently we are the worst kind of blackhearted ignorant heathen gringos if we did n't know all the time that the Virgin was interceding for me .

They depend on the Virgin for everything . Not even sense enough to call the doctor . " He got to his feet . " There 's no use waiting . Go slip the old girl a peso . I 'll start . " He walked across the platform and began the descent . The woman regarded Gail stolidly , resistingly . Gail was resolute . She seized the woman 's hand and pulled it to her and pressed it . " Much as gracias , " she said , over and over , " mochas gracias , " until the woman smiled , embarrassed . They laughed together . Gail bought a diminutive silver heart , and entering the church she pinned it on the red velvet curtain with the other ex-votos . When she came out , the three boys were hanging over the balustrade , shouting names down after Pierce . In the distance the afternoon stormclouds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hidden Popocatepetl from the plain . The boys ran when they saw Gail . Below her Pierce made his way slowly . He seemed foreshortened , smaller , his pink-and-lilac sombrero tilted , the assured shoulders bowed , as he watched the stones under his feet , descending alone . " Gringos , " the boys shouted , peeking from the portales , laughing and shoving each other . " Gringos .
