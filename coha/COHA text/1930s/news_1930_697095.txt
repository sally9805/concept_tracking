txt Although little visible action has so far followed upon publication of the Commerce Commission 's official plan of consolidation early in December last , the belief is held in both banking and railroad circles that matters are stirring in the eastern field . It is in this part of the country that rivalries for control of key lines have been most acute and the difficulties in the way of settlement most serious . Small-scale conferences , including executives of only two trunk line interests at a time , have been numerous since the commission 's plan appeared and are believed in many quarters to have paved the way to early resumption of the round-table sessions on unification in the East . which were suspended about two years ago . Efforts have been made in these two-party conversations to develop on one hand the extent to which all carriers concerned could accept the commission 's plan and on the other hand the departures therefrom which , might be necessary and useful to bring about agreement of the carriers on a common program . It is recognized that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important particulars unless convincing reasons for doing so can be shown , but it is also pointed out that a scheme adopted by the principal trunk line interests would be carried out much more rapidly than one which continued to meet stout opposition . Some railroad men , in fact , predict that in the absence of general regional agreements no important consolidations or mergers are likely to be brought about for many years . Trend Toward Four Systems The trend of the most recent discussions , among eastern executives has been toward a return to the four system scheme for the East . Some rather important concessions in that direction are authoritatively reported to have been made , though it is emphasized that these have been wholly tentative in character and dependent upon other concessions and adjustments yet to be made . For that reason a five system scheme , more or less resembling that adopted by the commission in its official plan . may yet be adopted by agreement But , so far as the carriers themselves are concerned , the prospect for acceptance of a four system plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more promising than it has been since 1921 . The commission 's proposed fifth system , to be compozed of Wabash . Lehigh Valley . Norfolk &; Western . Seaboard Air Line Railway Wheeling &; Lake Erie . Pittsburgh &; WCEL Virginia and Western Maryland , has apparently met with support in no other railroad quarter than the management of the Wabash Railway . What is most significant is that it has obviously lacked warm support from the management of the Pennsylvania Railroad , which is credited with actual or potential ownership of an absolute majority of Wabash shares , directly and indirectly owns working control of the Lehigh Valley and is conceded a strong foot-hold in Pittsburgh &; West Virginia through the Pennroad Corporation . The question has also been seriously raised whether a fifth system along the lines laid down by the commission as yet commands any banking support . At a recent hearing before the commission on the Baltimore &; Ohio 's application for authority to acquire control of the Buffalo Susquehanna. it was testified by a B. &; 0 . executive that his road had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction over 25 ' , ; - to 34 ; ' , ; . It may safely be : ventured that the proportion of Reading stock owned by the B. &; 0 . or available to it for voting purposes is not less than 40 ; : . and possibly it is well above that figure . There appears to be reason to assume that the New York Central has not increased its Reading holdings of just over 25 " - , l. ; if that is the case , it might reasonably he inferred that the Central has no objection to the B. &; 0 acquiring working control of the Reading by itself Pennsylvania Railroad 's Attitude Bearing in mind that the New York Central has frequently indicated that it would be willing to turn its Reading stock over to the B &; O. in case it could obtain either Lehigh Valley or Lackawanna to afford it the " interior route " to New York Harbor which it regards as a necessity , the Central 's attitude towards B. &; 0 . ' s purchase of Reading is probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the Lehigh N+alley which it now controls The Pennsylvania is generally known to be greatly concerned over the Commerce Commission 's assignment of the Norfolk &; Western to a proposed Wabash-Lehigh-Seaboard system , coupled as it is with the commission 's clear intimation that all of its proposed systems " must befindepencen1 in fact as well as in name . " As the commission 's plan stands this means that the Pennsylvania must not only give up its control of Lehigh Valley and Wabash but must also surrender its domination of the Norfolk &; Western which has Existed for a generation . This is evidently the bads for the widespread belief in railroad circles that the Pennsylvania Railroad is now more favorably disposed toward a four system scheme than ever before . Its assent to such a treatment of the eastern situation would n 1 mean that its aggressive policy of recent years , exemplified by its acquisition of contra , of near-control of Lehigh Valley and Wabasr .. and its purchases through the Pennroad Corporation of the Detroit , Toledo &; Ironton. and substantial holdings of Pittsburgr &; West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine Central and Bangor &; Aroostook has oeen in vain . These acquisitions have put the Pennsylvania in an extraordinarily strong trading position which will undoubtedly be reflected in the final outcome of the unification movement .
