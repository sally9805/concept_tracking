At 17 , Louis Ethelbert Whitsitt , a bright , brown-eyed Michigan lad with good schooling and a job , seemed headed in the right direction . Then , one night in 1933 , he went dead wrong . With his big brother and two other fellows , he kidnapped and robbed a Detroit man named Joseph Nesbitt , watched one of the gang shoot the victim and leave him to die by the roadside . <P> At 23 , Louis Ethelbert Whitsitt , now Convict No. 34,234 in Southern Michigan State Prison at Jackson , still has considerable time to serve . He got life for the murder , 45 to 90 years for the kidnapping . The judge said the sentences were to run concurrently . If he keeps out of trouble , and if , somehow , the life sentence should be commuted , Louis Whitsitt might be let out by 1950 , or anyway by 1982 . <P> So far , hopeful young Lifer Whitsitt has been an exemplary prisoner . Three years ago his excellent behavior got him a break . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prison . Then he began to talk prison officials into letting him ghostwrite crime articles for them . Last month he earned $145 that way . <P> But young Lifer Whitsitt 's chief pastime is broadcasting . For the last three years he has been Jackson prison 's official newscaster , reporting daily prison news and gossip to 4,100 of the 5,440 inmates over the prison 's elaborate cell-to-cell hookup . <P> " Good evening , men , " Whitsitt may say , " tonight 's feature story is headed : ' Thirteen incorrigibles shipped to Siberian stir . ' " Siberia , in Michigan stir talk , is Marquette prison . Other items may have a warmer touch . Prisoner So-and-so lost a picture of his wife in the textile factory . Reward for its return : two packs of cigarets . Prisoner Such-and-such will swap a pair of $12 shoes , which do n't fit him , for 16 packs of cigarets . Whitsitt used to broadcast complaints and comments on prison regimen , too , but nowadays he has to stick to straight news , paroles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitsitt is trusted to go pretty much where he pleases in the prison , pesters the life out of turnkeys and wardens alike for items . But what buzzes along the prison grapevine , wise Lifer Whitsitt lets severely alone . One night last fortnight the grapevine crackled with details of an attempted jailbreak , in which six escaping prisoners killed a guard . Of this black-type story , the Radio Gazette has broadcast not a peep . Says young Lifer Whitsitt : " I 'm no Walter Winchell. "
