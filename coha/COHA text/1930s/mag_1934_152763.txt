Roosevelt &; Recovery had raised wages . New steel prices , up $3 to $4 per ton , had raised the cost of basic raw material . So last week the Automobile Industry , prize pupil of the President 's Recovery class , raised its prices . <P> Chrysler led off by upping the price of Plymouth $25 to $45 , Dodge $45 , Chrysler sixes $40 to $55 , Chrysler airflows $100 to $130 . DeSoto was left unchanged . Then Studebaker added $25 to its " Dictator " and " Commander , " $50 to its " President . " General Motors swung into line with increases of $20 to $30 on Pontiac and Chevrolet , $65 to $130 on Buick , $35 to $65 on Oldsmobile . Cadillac V-16s went up $300 , La Salles $100 . Hudsons went up $5 to $75 , Graham-Paiges $50 , except one model . A few independents left their prices unchanged , including Packard and Nash-and Henry Ford . <P> Once again Henry Ford seized his chance to use the industry for his sounding board . Others could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of Fords would stay where it was . To a representative of Dow , Jones &; Co. ( financial news service ) he declared : " When prices go up , business goes down . . . . There is nobody who can pay the increased prices except our own people ; and if they have not the price demanded they simply do n't buy . But this is all too simple for the great economic minds that direct our affairs . .. . " . . . We are making a part of everything we use and from this nucleus we can readily expand to take care of any or all of our requirements , if necessary . . . . " When wages are increased and prices held down , it simply compels the heads of concerns to work harder . . . . Increasing prices is a lazy way to make dividends . " <P> Keeping the price down was obviously more to Henry Ford than an economic principle . He had already got a head-start in 1934 production while the tool &; die strike bedeviled other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his steel , could and probably would make more . Smartly he had stalled off labor troubles by raising wages long before the other companies . <P> Henry Ford 's course was straight and clear . But General Motors ' price-upping seemed to conflict momentarily with the views of one of its own high priests of industrial economics . Vice President James David Mooney , in charge of exports , had declared in his book The New Capitalism published scarcely two months ago : " High prices , particularly if they are out of balance , tend to destroy the interchange of goods , and cause a starved flow of goods to consumers . Such prices destroy purchasing power , dry up demand , create unemployment , and lower the standard of living . ' ' <P> How much motor production has already been stimulated by Recovery was plain when figures for the first quarter were released last week . Chrysler had shipped 167,842 cars in the first quarter , against 58,347 for the first quarter last year . With stacks of orders still unfilled , General Motors had produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of 1933.
