One day last week the Newark ( N. J. ) Ledger failed to appear . Practically the whole editorial staff had walked out on strike , called by the Ledger chapter of the local Newspaper Guild ( TIME , Nov. 26 ) . Publisher Lucius T. Russell 's announced reason for shutting down was that he did not wish to subject loyal members of his staff to " indignities and harassments " from the strikers . Two days later the Ledger resumed publication , and big , blustery Publisher Russell , up from a sickbed , bought full page space in the New York Times to state his case : <P> " TODAY 'S NEWARK SUNDAY LEDGER OF 100,000 COPIES " will contain 132 pages reported , written , edited , selected by newspapermen NOT bossed and disciplined and hired and fired by Heywood Broun 's children of the Guild ( one year old ) . ... If Heywood Broun 's children of the Guild ( one yr. old ) want to boss and hire and fire reporters and writers and editors and artists they will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving one . " <P> Appended was voluminous correspondence between the publisher and the Guild last July , purporting to show that Mr. Russell had tried to cooperate with the Guild until goaded beyond endurance by Guild efforts to dictate to him . <P> The Guild 's reply : " Absurd . " <P> Following a week of mutual recriminations Publisher Russell and the Guild finally got together to talk business . The meeting was brief , bitter . Publisher Russell slapped on the table a statement that , except on the order of arbitrators , he would sign no Guild contract that even raised the question of his sole authority to hire &; fire for any reason he saw fit . Neither would he contract with a Guild that included copy boys , office boys , messengers , clerks , telephone operators , etc . Inclusion of those groups with newswriters , said he , " is nothing more than a surreptitious effort to impose a vertical union for strike purposes . " <P> The strike went on .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
