When the ingenious Chinese people do not have enough airplanes , or wish to impress the Japanese by seeming to have more than they possess , they build extra planes of reed and matting construction ( see cut ) . These-parked appetizingly in view-have drawn many a Japanese bomb away from real Chinese planes hidden elsewhere . <P> The ingenious Chinese government last week had Japan guessing whether the chief of their Air Force was still Mme Chiang Kaishek , or whether the job had passed to her brother , T. V. Soong , or whether- according to the last of three equally flat and contradictory Chinese announcements - the new Chief is anti-Communist General Chien Ta-chun . Reds call him " Bloody Chien " for his ruthless suppression of the 1928 Communist uprising at Canton and the 1929-30 Communist uprisings at Changsha . <P> It appeared certain that Mr. T. V. Soong had at last left the safety of British Hong Kong , flown to often-bombed Hankow where he resumed his functions as Chairman of the Bank of China " and Head of the Chinese Air Force " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
