DriscAnTi , , s laid it down that the first step to be taken by anybody entering on a course of philosophical speculation was to make a complete clearance from his mind of all existing beliefs , SO as to enter on his work in a state of universal doubt and interrogation . Whatever may be the value of this expedient , there is one condition essential to its success , and that is that the mind thus cleared be the mind of a philosopher ; and as long as philosophers only resort to it , if it does no great good , it is pretty sure to do no harm . Unfortunately , however , we are witnessing an attempt in France  --  and the present attempt is only the latest of many  --  on the part of " the average man " to apply this method to the work of practical politics , and there is a strong disposition among the class of reformers to which we have taken the liberty of applying the term of " Sentimentalists " to try it to the extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all practise it , is very simple . The first thing done is to resolve that whatever is , is wrong ; that the fact that a thing has existed raises a presumption against its utility ; and that it is at any time open to any community to tear down all its institutions , and to build up new ones , on a philosophical basis , constructed out of the'inner consciousness of its more voluble members . It consists , in other words , of the adoption of the Cartesian method by a great crowd of persons , the best of whom have little mental training of any kind , and the mass of whom are very ignorant , and in their total release from what is perhaps the strongest , and for political purposes will have to be the strongest , of the social forces , at least till the human race has entered on a stage of culture from which we are certainly still ages distant  --  viz. , habit . It is perhaps fortunate for mankind that the French took upon themselves to try this experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries were quite ready for it , and that we should now be witnessing the close of it before , the delusion which prompted it had spread any further or gained more power . France was , at the first Revolution , made a tabula rasa , and in the process an enormous amount of rubbish was unquestionably swept away . If the French nation , and especially the Parisian portion of it , had . then been composed of philosophers of the first order , doubtless something very fine might have been built up on the cleared ground . They went to work as if they had been philosophers , however , and as if the community were as wax in their hands , and as if they despised the past and could defy the future . Their mode of reconstruction was very simple ? namely , to create out of their imagination a set of ideals , and treat them as actually existing powers , to which it was only necessary to give full liberty of action in order to secure the happiness of the nation . One  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of these  --  was The People , which was always spoken of , not simply as the aggregate of the human beings inhabiting the national territory , but as a moral person , not only of great strength , but of consummate wisdom , purity , and goodness , which never erred , was never deceived , and , if let alone , was sure to do all things well , distribute justice , respect rights , and employ the proper agents of its will . how its will was to be got at never clearly appeared . A popular vote was never accepted as a satisfactory expression of it , as it was always said by those against whom the vote went that the essence known as the " People 's Will , " in passing through the gross medium of the ballot , became corrupted and distorted ; and it generally turned out that if you wanted to get at the real thing , the proper course was to attend a lecture by a certain orator , on a certain evening , in a certain hall , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine extract supplied to you on any subject of interest . This of course was only true as regarded general questions . If you wanted to know the People 's Will as to who should fill a public office , you got it in a different way  --  namely , from a knot of gentlemen called a club or caucus , who " thought it out " in a private room . This type travelled far and wide . It made its way to the United States , to England , and to Germany , and has to this day a powerful hold on the popular imagination in all of them . In all of them , though in the United States , ever since Jefferson 's day , more than in the others , the People still sits apart , looking after things  --  a mysterious but terrible abstraction , before whom all tremble and adore  --  who selects not only the best governors and sheriffs but the best judges ; but has to have the custom-house clerks changed about once a year , and is made perfectly furious by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and political economy like poison . The next type was The Republic . This was an ideal organization got up by The People for the banishment from the earth of poverty and crime , and the establishment of truth and justice . Its armies were invincible , and remain so to this day ; its generals men of matchless skill and valor ; its courts wise and incorruptible ; and love its only law . It was the hold of this type on the popular imagination , and its complete separation in the popular mind from all experience , which led to the extravagant declarations which followed the overthrow of the Empire at Sedan . The New York Tribune called attention the other day to the folly of the Provisional Government in protracting the war by declaring , as soon as it took office , that it would not cede " an inch of territory or the stone of a fortress . " But this was preceded by a still greater folly , consisting in a declaration that the Republic would make no peace as long as a single Prussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition made by the Republic to the Prussians was that they should go back across the Rhine , and there treat . Now , this tone was undoubtedly taken , even by a man of such ability as Jules Favre , under the influence of that sovereign faith in the mysterious power to control circumstances enjoyed by this abstract Republic , which , in the minds of Frenchmen of the democratic school , is not a political organization made up of Frenchmen as all the world knows them  --  that is , the Frenchmen of to-day , who have served two military tyrants within the present century with the greatest devotion ? but a being of vast strength , raising great armies with the wave of a wand , and hurling them , under matchless leaders , on the helpless foe , and diffusing happiness and plenty through a smiling land on the return of peace . The wild exultation which followed the proclamation of the Republic at Paris was really due to the secret belief that there was some magic in the name that would take the poison of eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable demoralized armies to recover in a day their discipline , and courage , and self-respect . The mania , too , as might have been expected , crossed the Atlantic , and found plenty of victims here . King William and Bismarck were savagely abused by some of our own Sentimentalists , because their earthy eyes did not also see the bright vision and bow before it ; give his sword back to De Failly , because he was now a soldier of the Republic ; and listen with awe to the utterances of Flourens and Roche-fort , who were two of the high-priests of the new deity . Another of these imaginary types rapidly growing up here among ourselves is Woman ; not woman as we all see her and know her , and as the world has known her since the dawn of history , but a Woman of the mind , whose subordination to man , in the family and in society , and exclusion from politics , have been the great , if not the sole , cause why the People and the Republic have hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woman it is , now , whose participation in affairs is to bring our criminal jurisprudence to perfection , banish corruption from our politics , vice from our streets , inefficiency from our public service , and , in short , save modern society from all the evils which most afflict it . If you ask where this Woman is to be found , you find that she has never been embodied in the flesh ; she is an abstraction made up of the attributes of various remarkable women  --  of Miss Cobbe 's intellectual power , Mrs. Josephine Butler 's electioneering talent , Mrs. Cady Stanton 's dignity , Miss Susan Anthony 's activity , Mrs. Howe 's eloquence , Queen Victoria 's domestic virtues , and the administrative ability of divers Hindoo princesses ; and we are asked to believe that , when this combination is brought to bear on our affairs , we shall have a new earth . A striking illustration of the golden haze which surrounds her is to be found in the protest made by the Boston Woman 's Rights advocates against the extreme ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Yorkers on the question of marriage and divorce . The former are resolutely opposed to all discussion of this subject now ; but they promise that when Woman makes her appearance in the Legislature , and comes to debate marriage with Man on equal ground , something  --  they do not say what  --  will be done which will make marriage what it ought to be , Now , as there arc only three things any human legislature can do about marriage ? ( 1 ) make divorce easy ; ( 2 ) make it difficult ; ( 3 ) or abolish marriage altogether  --  and as the two first plans have been in full operation in various parts of the world under male auspices , and as the last has been tried by varions persons already without any legislative sanction ever since the creation , and not one of them has thus far seemed to hasten the millennium , the notion that when Woman takes the thing up husbands and wives will live together in lifelong peace , is evidently another form of the delusion under which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of France ought to be , and we trust will be , a solemn warning against the whole process . No healthy national life and no sound political system can be built up on it . The basis of everything good in politics is character , and no character can be strong whose owners habitually live in dream-land , and treat their own fancies as forces capable of governing the world . Such people always shirk the facts of life , and the more they shirk them , the harder it becomes to face them . They begin , therefore , by deceiving themselves ; they end by deceiving others . The result is general mendacity anclmoral rottenness ; and , ; finally , Sedan and Metz . The day is sure to come when valiant , self reliant men are needed to stand in the breach or thee the iron shower , and nothing is found but rhetoricians and poetasters and demagogues ; when naked , unadorned truth is needed to save the nation , and the air is filled with lies ; when strong brains are needed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysterical declaimers , wailing over the break-up of their own illusions , and telling a scornful world that if everything had gone differently , things would not be as they are . MONOPOLIES AND THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT . IT may be remembered by some of our readers that at the time of the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment certain politicians objected to incorporating it in the Constitution on the ground that , though only intended to establish the civil rights of negroes , its terms were so far-reaching that it might possibly be construed by the courts into something much more dangerous . A curious case has recently arisen in Louisiana which will probably result in a determination of this question by the Supreme Court at Washington . The facts of the case were these : For a long time back the health of the inhabitants of New Orleans is said to have been endangered by the presence of innumerable slaughter-houses , scattered through the city with less regard for its sanitary condition than for the convenience of the butchers . With the ostensible design of improving the health of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed an act , the practical effect of which was to incorporate the Crescent City Lire Stock Landing and Slaughterhouse Company , and to give it a monopoly of the business for twenty-five years , within a certain district . The act directed the discontinuance of all other yards , slaughter-houses , and stock landings . The new company were to be entitled to levy tolls on all cattle slaughtered at their shambles . The avowed object of the act was to localize a business which the hot climate rendered dangerous to the health of the inhabitants during certain portions of the year  --  in other words , it was enacted as a police regulation . Whether the minds of the legislators who passed the bill were in reality influenced by sanitary or by pecuniary considerations , we have of course no means of knowing . It is enough for us to know that its passage caused great dissatisfaction among the butchers of New Orleans , who found their business sadly interfered with , and at once applied to the courts for relief . The Supreme Court of Louisiana sustained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' United States . The suits brought were innumerable ; but the case which has recently been decided by Judges Bradley and Woods in the Circuit Court is the most important . The Court ( Mr. Justice Bradley delivering the opinion ) held , in substance , that the monopoly in question was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment , which declares that all persons born or naturalized in the ' United States , and subject to its jurisdiction , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside , and that no State shalt , make or enforce any law whic't shall abridge the prit lieges or immunitieP , of citizens of the nited States ; nor shall any State deprice any person , of liberty , or property . without due process or law , 1 ) 01 ' deny to any person , . with in its jurisdiction the egaal protection to " the laws . The reasoning by which the court reaches this conclusion is this : Although the privileges 14elonging to citizens of the ' United States , which the Amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws abridge , may be difficult to define , " we may safely say that it is one of the privileges of every American citizen to adopt and follow such lawful and industrial pursuit , not injurious to the community , as he may see fit , without unreasonable regulation or molestation , and without being restricted by any of those unjust , oppressive , and odious monopolies or exclusive privileges which have been condemned by all free governments . " " There is no more sacred right of citizenship than the right to pursue unmolested a lawful employment in a lawful manner . It is nothing more nor less than the S , VCRED RIGHT OF LABOR . " As the act incorporating the company in effect prevented the butchers and livestock men of New Orleans from pursuing their lawful calling , it inter - tercel with this right , and was unconstitutional . Such is the reasoning of the court . The case will probably come before the Supreme Court , and will there receive full consideration . Meanwhile , we desire to call attention to the decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad , and strikes not merely a blow at a New Orleans slaughter-house company , but at the existence of almost every franchise in the United ? States . Every patent , every railroad franchise , every canal , turnpike , and ferry company in the world is a monopoly . They are all cases of exclusive rights , vested in a small number of private persons . A railroad franchise , for example , confers an exclusive right of carrying passengers and freight between two designated points ; it is absolutely exclusive of all the world , since any one who attempts to conduct this business within the established limits  --  or , in other words , over the company 's tracks  --  renders himself liable to an action . In the same way , a patent confers an exclusive right to manufacture and sell a particular article for a certain length of time , and unquestionably infringes the sacred right of labor , if anything of the kind does . To these arguments Judge Bradley replies in the following way : He says that the right to labor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society only gives to " the patentee " the temporary exclusive use of that which , without him , it would not have had the benefit of , as a consideration of that benefit and to encourage others to make use of their powers . " As to franchises , his argument is that the legislature does not interfere with the " sacred right of labor " by conferring them , because , in the first place , the employment made legal by them could not in the absence of legislative provisions be pursued by private individuals at all ; and , in the second place , because " society obtains a consideration for the grant of these franchises in the investment of large amounts of capital in public improvements which are required for the development of the country and its resources . " We are unable to follow these distinctions . ? In the case of the patentee , as in the case of the railroad , the ostensible object of the grant is a public benefit ; the immediate effect is an exclusive privilege . This is precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential distinction between such objects as the public health and the public wealth ; still less do we follow the argument as to railroad and other like franchises , that as they confer rights to do what the legislature alone can authorize to be done , and which no private citizen has a right to do without such authority , they are , therefore , different from monopolies which interfere with previously established occupations . It is true that the public advantages claimed for railroads can not be obtained without legislative interf  --  rence ; but it is equally true that the public advantages claimed as the result of concentrating an unhealthy business in a particular locality can not be obtained without the same interference . It is true that legislative interference in the one case does not seem to interfere with any previously established pursuit ; bat this is only an apparent distinction . The introduction of railroads broke up the old lines of stage-coaches , just as the slaughter-house act is New Orleans interferes with the business of the butchers ; and the old stagecoach required no act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than butchers do to enable them to slaughter animals . So it may be said of a ferry franchise that it interferes with the " sacred right of labor " in exactly the same way . Did not the old-fashioned ferryman , who had enjoyed for a lifetime the sacred right of carrying passengers and freight across the stream on the banks of which be lived , regard as an odious monopoly the charter which took away from hint his livelihood ? We are driven to the conclusion that all these exclusive privileges belong to the same category ; their ostensible object is a benefit to the public ; their immediate effect the pecuniary emolument of private individuals . But Judge Bradley says that the act of the Louisiana legislature , so far as it is a police regulation  --  in other words , so far as it inures to the public advantage  --  is valid , but that the claim that it was nothing more than a police regulation was " too bald for a moment 's consideration . " How this is shown does not appear . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grossly and palpably a " job , " so obviously passed for the benefit of a ring , that the avowed object of the legislature is of no avail . There is a principle in the law of taxation which makes it necessary that a tax shall be laid for a public purpose ; and any tax which is grossly and obviously laid for private benefit is set aside by the courts as unconstitutional . But the case must be such an extreme one as to appear on the face of it a swindle . It may be that Judge Bradley , having this principle in mind , thought an analogy might be drawn between the case of a tax and the case of a monopoly . But will any one say that the Louisiana act is on the face of it a swindle ? The declared public object is at least a reasonable one . But this is a technical legal point with which we have nothing to do . Our object in the present article has been to show , as we have endeavored to do , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to patents , railroads , and other private franchises , quite as well as to the privileges conferred upon the New Orleans Slaughter-House Company . If the decision is sustained , every moneyed corporation in the country is in danger of destruction . Whenever a court can be satisfied that the exclusive privilege granted by the State or the United States inures rather to private than to public advantage , the franchise will be set aside as in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment . Very few corporations will be able to stand this test . It seems hardly possible that the Supreme Court will sustain Judge Bradley ; but , if they do , the consequences which we have endeavored to indicate appear not improbable . MR . BOUTWELL AND THE CIVIL SERVICE . ONE result of the recent trouble between Mr. Cox and the President , which , though perhaps not very important , is not wholly without value , is the sudden development of zeal on the part of divers high functionaries for the purity and efficiency of the civil service . There appears , if we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervading our political circles that the Government offices should be filled by " honest and competent men " which would have done credit to the best days of the Republic . They do not propose , of course , to adopt any such new-fangled tests of fitness as are proposed by Cox and Jenckes and Schurz ; " the people " would not stand it . They have little contrivances of their own , which do the work without inconvenience to the party . The best and latest of these is that of Mr. Boutwell . This gentleman is opposed to civil service reform , as the term is generally used . He has again and again expressed his belief that the party could only be " run " by making the offices the reward of party service , and dismissal the penalty of " unsoundness , " and , we may add , holds that opinion at present . As soon as Mr. Cox took office , he began to introduce the system , not of examination only , but of competitive examination , into the Patent Office and Census @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support from Mr. Boutwell , whose department contains a larger number of employees than any other , and was , therefore , the seat of the principal scandals connected with the office-seeking business . In fact , the latter has always avoided any sign of departure from the party traditions on this subject . There is an act of Congress , of 1853 , which provided for the examination of Government clerks , and to which we referred a fortnight ago , but we believe it is correct to say that the examinations held under it were , down to 1869 , rather practical jokes than tests of efficiency . In fact , the law was a dead-letter till June of that year , when an order was issued , signed by the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , and directing the examinations to be held in a bonfilicle manner ; and this the Boston Advertiser published a week ago , as proof that the charge brought against Secretary Boutwell of indifference to civil service reform was unfounded . Enquiry , however , now elicits from the Treasury Department itself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the examinations held under this order were a farce , and remained a farce for a whole year . It was not till September last that any serious attempt was made to enforce the law , and this only under pressure of the growing public feeling on this subject and the example set by Mr. Cox in the Department of the Interior . The character of this attempt at reform is worth study . It consists of an order and an " examination schedule , " which we reprint in full . " TREASURY DEPARTMENT , July 29 , 1870 . " It is ordered that from and after this date the Board of Examiners provided for by the third section of the act of Congress , approved March 3 , 1853 , will be constituted as follows : " The chief of the bureau to which the clerk is assigned , the chief clerk of the department , and E. B. Elliott , Esq. , of the office of the Secretary of the Treasury . " Examinations will be in writing , and must show the process by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be submitted with the report of the Board of Examiners , and filed with the appointment division of this office . GEORGE S. BOTJTWELL . " TREASURY DEPARTMENT EXAMINATION SCHEDULE .

Washington , D. C. , September , 1870 . It would be difficult , we suppose , to hit upon a better contrivance than the above for throwing dust in the public eyes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination schedule " by itself means absolutely nothing . If Mr. Boutwell wants to convince people of his good faith in this matter , he must publish a batch of the examination papers  --  that is , of the questions drawn up and put under the schedule , and of the answers returned by the persons appointed . To judge whether this new process is or is not , like its predecessor , a farce , we want to know what the examining board asked the candidates , and what the candidates said in reply . Everything depends on this , and , after what has happened , it is abstird for Mr. Boutwell to ask the country to trust his simple assertion , or that of his subordinates , in this matter . The examination papers are , we presume , on file ; let us have a sample of them along with the monthly accounts of the Treasury . Write two hundred and forty , is a question in notation . Add 2 , 7 , and 4 ; substract 20 from 40 , and multiply 7 by 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How ninny pints in a quart ? is " a question pertaining to United States weights and measures . " On what river does Washington stand ? is " a geographical question . " And , What year was Richmond taken ? is " a historical question . " In fact , an examination which is held in secret , and the results of which are not published , and which is conducted by men who are opposed to the principle of examinations altogether , is almost an insult to the public intelligence . No reform of the civil service can be anything but a mockery , a delusion , and a snare which ( 1 ) does not consist in the examination of candidates by persons unconnected with the departments , and , above all , unconnected with the party in power . The board must be thoroughly independent . The present board consists of Sir . Boutwell 's appointees , whom he can dismiss at pleasure , and who are as much interested as he in " running the machine ; " that is , in seeing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress obtain their fair quota of the offices for their hangers-on. ( 2 ) The examination must be open to every American citizen , high and low , rich and poor . Every man has a right to have a chance to enter the public service if he shows himself qualified . Neither Mr. Boutwell nor any Congressman has any right to shut him out . ( 3 ) It must , as a guarantee of fairness and of efficiency both , be competitive ( that is , if there are many candidates for one place , the person who passes the best examination must be held entitled to the place ) , and it must be public ( that is , be either conducted with open doors or have the results published ) ; and ( 4 ) the tenure of office must either be during good behavior or for a fixed term . Anybody who rests satisfied with the device which Mr. Boutwell is now working at Washington may feel assured that he has given the Forneys and Chandlers the best possible cover for their operations .
