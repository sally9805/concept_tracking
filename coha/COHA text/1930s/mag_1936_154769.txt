Richest and most inexplicable cultist in the U. S. is Major J. ( " Father " ) Divine , " God " to many a blackamoor and moody white in New York 's Harlem and elsewhere . Slick little Father Divine lives well , maintains a Rolls-Royce , flies about in an airplane , provides abundant low-price meals to his followers . But he keeps no books , has never paid an income tax . Leaving it to his followers to assert blandly , that he " manifests " money out of nothing , the black " God " has seemed to take poker-faced delight in evading questions about his income . Since he has a good Negro lawyer , Arthur Madison , Father Divine knows well that he would be in serious trouble with the U. S. Government were he to admit , after denying it for years , that he collects cash from his followers , handles receipts from restaurants and small businesses operated in his name in Harlem . Last week a Manhattan lawyer who had been after Father Divine for months seemed about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Law . <P> Two years ago near Baltimore a bus bearing Divine " angels " bound for Manhattan collided with the automobile of a Mrs. Nina I. Bayless of Aberdeen , Md . She brought suit against Father Divine and his lieutenant in whose name the bus was registered . A Maryland court awarded her a judgment of $6,000 . Seeking to collect the money for Mrs. Bayless , Lawyer William W. Lesselbaum of Manhattan examined Father Divine and several " angels , " could get none to admit that the cultist had any funds . Lawyer Lesselbaum began sleuthing . Last week in Manhattan he obtained an order to show cause why Father Divine should not be punished for contempt of court for his evasiveness and " false statements . " To prove his point Lawyer Lesselbaum offered testimony in the form of affidavits from disillusioned onetime Divinites . <P> A mechanic in Father Divine 's " Peace " Garages swore that the Harlem " God " paid him his weekly $30 in cash from a fat roll of bills . An Ulster county realtor said that Father Divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tract of the cult 's " Promised Land " ( TIME , Aug. 31 ) , although title to the property was conveyed to a Divine disciple . One of 30 cashiers in Divine restaurants , a girl who had taken the name of " Humility Consolation , " reported that all receipts were paid to Father Divine , that on many a night the clinking of coin could be heard in the black man 's bedroom . Best documented affidavit was that of " Rebecca Grace " ( Mrs. Verinda Brown ) , who with her husband gave the cause $5,317 , of which $4,051 was paid direct to the Father . Affirmed Mrs. Brown in Lawyer Lesselbaum 's language :
