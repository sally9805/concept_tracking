T WALNUTS A STORY BY GRIFFITH BEEMS ? D ID N'T cha get it ? ? Clark Cunningham called , sliding to the sidewalk from the stone embankment by the boarded-up Episcopal Church at the edge of town . He gave the two gunny sacks on which he had been sitting a swing , wrapping them round his arm , and stood waiting for Jitney . Clark had run all the way home after school for the gunny sacks . " Nothing doing , " Jitney reported , smacking a clinker against the stone embankment in his disgust . Jitney was wearing a red-and-green knitted cap , rolled small , set above his ears . He gathered the cinder fragments and shied them at the church roof . The cinders tinkled down the shingles and plinked in the eaves trough . " Could n't cha get it ? " " It 's that fathead 's fault . What does he do but forget to tell his mother we 're coming for it . It 's there , all right . It 's in the shed . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she says , without Clarence knowing , and Clarence did n't say nothing to her about it . So there you are . Clarence of course , that fathead , is down watching football practice . His permission , my foot . I 'm not going to trot all that way down there and back , maybe for nothing . Besides we have n't got time . It 's after four now . " " Let 's go without it . " " Nothing doing . We got ta have a bike to bring them in on . I do n't want walnut stains on my shirt . " " I do n't care about walnut stains , " Clark urged . " Nothing doing . " Jitney unwound one of the gunny sacks from Clark 's arm and hoisted himself on to the embankment , the sack under him . Reluctantly Clark joined him . " I 'm telling you another thing , " Jitney stated belligerently . " Those nuts wo n't be there next week . To-morrow 's Saturday and after practice some of those big guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out after them . I'II betcha they do . This is a good place . You can bet your bottom dollar they know it . Old Acey 's run some of them out of there before this . " " Do you think it was Hank Faragher he shot at ? " " Might have been , " Jitney said . " Would n't surprise me . " He tore up handfuls of frozen grass and threw them at his shoe . " Mrs. Gillen burns me up , " he growled . " Why n't you argue with her ? " " I did , " Jitney yelled , completely losing patience . " Where do you think I been all this time ? I explained to her , nice , the same thing we told Clarence this morning after natural science , these booklets and samples of Dr. Ogden we got to distribute for Bye 's Drug Store , and she says she 's glad she knows now because she 'd never give her permission , even if Clarence did , because the boys that distribute things from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and litter the front lawn and waste samples . What can you do with a woman like that ? What can you do ? " Jitney was mature and bitter . The grass flew . " Let her alone , " Clark said , " I s'pose . " " I 'm not going to tote a couple bushel walnuts all that way on my back , " Jitney grumbled . " Nothing doing . The big fathead . The prize for memory . All his brains in his big toe . " Clark nudged him . " Hey , look . " Pedaling lackadaisically toward them , Roland Bye swung his bicycle from one side of the walk to the other alternately , looping Like a fancy skater . His red leather windbreaker was unbuttoned . Every now and then in his looping he dropped his right hand from the handlebar and let it swing at his side nonchalantly , as he leaned into another loop . His cap hung from the handlebars , fastened there by the snap and eye in the visor . " Hi , Bats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sitting on the stone embankment adjoining the walk , they were directly ahead of him . At the intersection Bats Bye swerved from the walk into the road , detoured past them , jumped his bike over the curb , and resumed the sidewalk , looping as he rode . " Come here , Bats , " they yelled together after him , supplicating at the top of their lungs . A block away , Bats suddenly sprinted , braked , cramped the wheel round , turning in the bicycle 's length , and came tearing back . He coasted up to them , one hand on the wall , holding the bicycle upright . " Hi , " he said . He was breathless as usual . Jitney blocked Bats from starting up by straddling over the front wheel , and leaned on the handlebars in his friendliness . " We were waiting for you , Bats , " he cajoled . " Come on . We got ta get going . You got ta come nutting with us , Bats . " " This is the best place going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to learn this place , Bats . " " There 's bushels . Bushels . " " Maybe I know it , " Bats whispered , staring a little , eyes rolling confidentially from Jitney to Clark and back again , his mouth open , in that intent breathless way . They figured they were getting him . " Where is it ? " lie whispered excitedly . " Maybe I know it . " Bats pretended to know everything . Bats ' father ran Bye 's Drug Store and was supposed to be a drug fiend and that explained Bats . It was easy to rattle Bats or stampede him . His mouth came open and a certain look came into his eyes , he pranced or jumped , and then he might do anything . " Where is it ? " he asked again breathlessly . Clark had slid down from the wall too . " Do we want to tell him ? " he objected . " Sure , " Jitney said . " Sure . Listen , Bats . " He wiggled the handlebars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Acey Sones ' . " Clark had his arm over Bats ' shoulder . " You 've heard of him . He let fly at one guy with a load of birdshot . Peppered him in the back . You are n't going to be afraid , are you , Bats ? You are n't going to run out on us ? " " Who , me ? " Bats protested , fidgeting . " Me ? " They could hear the bicycle saddle squeaking under him ; he was squirming with excitement . " It 's a good place , " he announced . Then he jounced on the seat . " Ai n't it , Jit ? " They had him . " Come on , " Jitney ordered briskly . " Clark , you leg it . We got ta hurry . Get on the handlebars , Bats . pedal . Come on . " In a moment Clark , running , had been left behind , and Jitney had turned the corner of the street and was hesitating at the top of the hill to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in places , spotty with loose stones , and just before it straightened out on the river flats it steepened . If they walked down Bats might change his mind , get ideas . They had n't even had to promise him a share in the nuts so far . The thing to do was to keep his mind occupied . Jitney took the hill . The footbrake , he figured , would burn out under their double weight , so he braked with his shoe , setting the toe of the shoe down on the front tire below the fork . It was hard , leaning forward to hold Bats steady on the handlebars and see past him , and at the same time bearing down with his shoe on the tire . Jitney took the hill slowly , and the bike complained , the front hub grinding every now and then , the tires ballooning . The sun was low and the shoulder of the hill shut it off from the road . Under the shoulder the light was cold and treacherous . The loose stones were hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signs on the barbed wire of the pasture fence , the telephone poles jogging by . Halfway down he was in difficulties . His hands on the bars had stiffened from cold ; the sole of his shoe burned , and his leg was splitting , so cramped he could n't tell whether he was pressing down or letting up on the front wheel . He wanted to change legs but did n't dare ; they were rolling by then . He damned himself for taking the hill ; he was earning his walnuts , he thought ; his leg was ready to drop off with cramp . A stone was coming and he tried to jockey the wheel . The handlebars resisted . If Bats , damn him , was trying to take charge . .. Bats had tightened up and he braced between Jitney 's arms , his face by jitney 's , as unresponsive and immovable as a lump of ice frozen there . They hit the stone , sideswiped it . lurched slightly . Jitney 's foot flew off the wheel . The bicycle jumped forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenched teeth whistled . The bicycle grabbed momentum , gulped momentum like gulping up air . Jitney tried to get his other foot back , braking , but he could n't ; they were tearing too fast . He hunted with his feet for the pedals , thought of the footbrake , calculated . At this speed the footbrake would pop like a wet match . They were two-thirds down and he let her go . The cold from the river whistled on his hands and at his cheeks , his eyes were dry and strained , his arms were set like twostruts ; he was iron all over , a part of the machine . He held to the middle of the road as if hypnotized . The bike bad stopped complaining . His face , close to Bats ' , was fighting the road . The road spun . They dipped into the steepest part of the hill and came down like a bat out of hell . The road was turning up at them , tilting up ; on both sides there were cornfields ; they were down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone poles ticking past . Jitney eased , straightened , whooed with relief . Bats came to life , let his legs dangle , took his hands off the handlebars , one at a time , and rubbed and blew them , put them back . Suddenly , as jitney made a dab at his cheek with his hand , Bats lifted up on the bars , shifting his cramped bottom , sliding it an inch to the other side of the fork nut , and in an instant they were plowing up the road and the bicycle bucking and kicking on top of them like a crazy horse . Jitney came back to himself slowly . The cold air was flowing into his pants-leg and he knew his pants must be ripped . He tried his knee cautiously and , just as he supposed , he had bunged it . It would stiffen up on him and he would be hobbling to-morrow , Saturday . Jitney swore under his breath and thought of Bats , joggling and spilling them at the last minute , and he cursed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bats was sitting up , feeling himself over systematically , and then he took off his windbreaker and examined the hack and elbows to see if his fall had scuffed the red leather . Bats ' callous self-absorption was too much for Jitney , and with his good leg he kicked the bicycle off himself and groaned . Bats , still seated on the ground , worked his arms back into the sleeves of his windbreaker . " You should'ave let me take us down , " Bats announced , resting his hands conversationally on his knees . " I know her better than you . I understand her , jits . " Jitney groaned again , in contradiction and contempt . He lay on his back in the middle of the road , disgustedly silent , commiserating with himself on his bunged knee , calculating that if Bats asked for a share in the nuts they would rook him by promising a third as soon as the nuts had had a chance to season on Clark 's porch roof . By the time the nuts dried , Bats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rambled on , telling the number of somersaults he had turned when he went off the handlebars ? as if any guy ever knew  --  and how he tucked in his head and lit on his shoulders , and a lot more . Jitney did n't listen . He lay there , inwardly fuming at Bats , his kid palaver and the spill , and waited for Clark . Neither of them moved from the ground until Clark came up and witnessed the disaster . They could hear him coming , running , his feet on the downhill clomping away regularly , and on the flats the sound of his running lightened . When he came up Bats started yarning excitedly what a lalapalooza his fall had been , the somersaults , and the rest of it . Jitney hobbled up , righted the bicycle , and tried the sprocket chain and pedal . He was grim . He took the two gunny sacks from Clark , hung them on the handlebars over Bats ' cap , so as to favor Bats ' tender flesh , ordered Bats on peremptorily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept up . At the river bridge the sky was lemonish yellow , and the matted leafless brush of the willows on the river flats made a rusty horizon of wintry twigs and branches . There was a rim of new ice at the water 's edge , knife thin , black with the water under it . They slowed on the bridge . At the icehouses a man with a team was unloading sawdust in preparation for the ice-making season . He rang his shovel on the iron wheel rim . Across the river , Jitney wheeled faster . They took a side road through a scrub stand of timber ; the road looped twice , the timber ended , and the road climbed out of the river valley , up a clay hill , between cut banks . The clay was stiff with frost . Bats and Jitney walked up the hill , pushing the bike . Near the top Jitney turned off , shoving the bicycle into the gully , upthe bank , through the brittle sumac bushes , and he and Bats lifted it over the barbed-wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bicycle clown behind a corn shock , completely hidden from the road , and waited for Clark . He came up the hill at a walk , slogging away , his head down , his second wind rasping in his throat , and Jitney whistled to him . They followed Jitney across the cornfield , through another fence , and across a fall plowed field . At the end of the field , beyond the line fence , the ground broke away with stone outcroppings ; the land was pasture and ran off to Three Run Creek . At the head of the little valley , in a hollow , was the grove . They were there . Bats started to climb the fence but Jitney stopped him . " We got ta be quiet , " he warned . " We do n't wanta get a load of slugs in our back . Take it easy . " Examining the ground , he took advantage of a washed place and rolled under the barbed wire . The three of them stood inside Acey Sones ' pasture and listened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . Behind them on the road they heard a car changing into low gear , descending the hill . Faintly , explosively , came the labor of a gasoline engine pumping water . It was at the Delmar place on the road . Acey Sones ' place was farther on and over the hill from them . The pasture with its frost-bitten yellowed grass , the valley with the dry gully and stony little ravine , the hollow and the seven walnut trees were empty of life , unguarded , still . In the half-light the trees stood waiting , the leaves sparse and ragged , the nuts knobby as fists among the hare looped branches . Even Jitney was unable to restrain himself . They broke and ran downhill to the trees . As Jitney had promised , the ground was covered with walnuts . The trees stood on a slope and the nuts , falling , rolled and lodged in pockets of grass , behind stones , in the track of the cow paths . They were half collected already . The three set to work swiftly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as the pile was started Jitney set Bats to trampling off the hulls . The frost-ripe hulls split like rinds under the blow of a heel and Bats danced furiously , imagining that every hull was the head of a rattlesnake and that he was braining them with his heel . Jitney and Clark , each with a sack , went over the ground collecting more nuts . In half an hour the easy nuts had been gathered and they went to work shucking . Bats held the gunny sack , his elbow crooked in the mouth of the sack so as to keep the opening large , while Jitney and Clark went over the trampled pile , picking out the walnuts from the broken hulls and tossing the nuts down the mouth of the sack . Those nuts that missed the mouth of the sack Bats was supposed to pick up with his free hand . The hulls stained their fingers and nails a deep blackish brown . Clark covertly completed the staining , rubbing the hulls down the backs of his fingers and into his palms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk when they finished and they had a gunny sack half full of hulled walnuts . If it were filled fuller it would have been awkward to tote . Jitney tied up the mouth with string and they dried their stained hands on the burlap of the sacking . They had been working too hard to talk and now they grinned at one another with satisfaction and counseled . Should they make a clear getaway while they could , or should they shake down the trees and fill the second sack ? Clark wanted to clear out but Jitney had a plan . They carried the filled sack down to the dry ditch that led into the ravine and dropped it there , kicking leaves over it . They dare n't climb the trees , Jitney pointed out , and shake the branches because the trees were hard climbing and anyway , if Acey came along , the guy that went up would be treed like a squirrel . The thing to do was to knock the walnuts down with clubs , and Bats should scout around and keep lookout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bats could see Acey 's houseand barns down by the bridge , and if Acey or any of Acey 's kids started that way he could warn them in plenty of time and they could light out . Bats zigzagged up the hill , taking cover momentarily behind all the rocks and bushes on the way , and Jitney and Clark hunted clubs , and Jitney let sling . The nuts thudded down , seven or eight at least , but the club made a great racket and clatter , bouncing and knocking in the branches before it fell out of the tree . Clark sailed a stick into a second tree . They gathered the fallen nuts after every throw . It was getting so dark the nuts were hard to find on the ground . They worked like mad . Acey Sones caught them from behind . He came along the line fence , and the first sight or sound they had of him was when Clark started for the sack and found Acey beside it in the dusk , his hands in the bib of his overalls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chunky man , a spot of veiny coloring in each rounding cheek , and a mouth as square as a bureau drawer . The peak of his corduroy hunter 's cap was pushed up . " Working hard , boys ? " Acey inquired jovially when they saw him . He did not smile . The red wristlets of his mittens stuck out of his mackinaw pocket . His joviality was false and hearty . They kept at a safe distance , ready to run . Clark cupped his hand over his mouth and wa-hooed . Then he yelled " Red light " several times and " Beefsteak . " That was for Bats , as a warning . " Three of you , eh ? " Acey said . He was between them and the line fence . He reached down and felt the bag of walnuts with his hand and then walked up and down a little , examining the ground . He kicked at the pile of hulls and sighted Bats hiding behind the farthest walnut tree . " Come on down here , " he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you come closer , so I do n't have to yell . " His hands were hooked peaceably on his overalls . " I do n't understand it , " amicably he went on . " This time of year I always get more hands down this way than I know how to manage . You 're the third set of boys this year . All wanting to pick up walnuts for me . Good workers too . All they need 's a little supervision at the right moment to see they do n't carry off my share of the nuts accidental . " Without smiling , he rumbled with laughter . The boys remained some thirty feet distant , spread out so as not to interfere with one another if they had to run . Bats had his legs apart , ready . Then Acey became serious . " I will say , " he stated aggrievedly , " I get kind of provoked sometimes at the boys that come in here , breaking down fences and running my cows , heating them so they hold up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad sometimes . " Clark spoke up . " We did n't do that , " he said . " I know you did n't , " Acey said . " I been standing up there by the fence watching you . I been watching you for a long time . Probably you boys would n't do those things . But if it 's walnuts you want why do you sneak in here without asking me ? Walnuts  --  why , hell , boys , what good are walnuts to me ? You ca n't sell ' em and you ca n't feed ' em . I got other things to do all day than sit on a fence and shell out walnut goodies to a carload of hogs . But you fellows do n't ever step down to the house and ask permission first . If you did then I 'd know who was up here in my pasture and I would n't be worrying about my fence and my cows . Did you ever think about that , boys ? Now you fellows  --  you seem all right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your name ? " From the side of his mouth , Jitney " psst " in warning . " Tom Swift . " " What 's yours ? " " Hank Faragher , " Jitney said . " You the boy that plays football ? You do n't look big enough to me . " " I 'm his kid brother . " Acey pointed at Bats . " I know you , " he said . " You 're Harry Bye 's boy . I 've seen you in your father 's drug store . " " You have not , " Bats contradicted sharply . " My father 's Fred Pillard . " Fred Pillard was the sheriff . " That big tub of guts , " Acey said . He apparently knew Fred Pillard . " Do n't you call my father that , " Bats said indignantly . Clark shushed Bats . " Can we have your permission , " he asked politely , " to take some walnuts ? " Acey ignored Bats ' indignation and Clark 's request . " Come here closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his feet , one-handed . There was a pile of walnuts on the ground waiting to go into the sack . " A sack of hulled walnuts like this , " Acey declared , " means a lot of work . " The three boys suddenly felt better . Acey could n't have been watching them from the line fence when they hid the first sack in the ditch or he would n't have said that , and if Acey thought the nuts in this sack were hulled he was n't going to be suspicious about the pile of hulls on the ground . But Acey was pretty slow if he could n't tell unhulled from hulled walnuts . Even the sound inside a sack was different , and Acey had felt the sack with his hand too . " Now I 'm fair . Maybe you 've heard different , but it 's not so . If I wanted to , I could run you off here , quick as scat . This is my land round here . This is my grove . You have n't no right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is private property . But I 'm fair . I only want my share . You fellows  --  you take this sack here " ? he kicked it ? " and carry it down to the house for me and empty it there , and let you come back and fill it for yourselves from that pile there . " He poked over the pile with his foot , sizing it up . " Fact is , " he said , " this pile 's not so big . You go knock down a few more , or you " ? he pointed suddenly at Jitney ? " you 're the biggest . You got a little heft . You skin up a tree and shake it . " But Jitney was not persuaded by Acey 's reasonableness . " Nothing doing , " he muttered , hacking off . He was n't going to be nabbed trying to shin up a tree . " Suit yourself , " Acey said . " Knock down a few more , bring ' em here , and as soon as this pile 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have it . But you got to promise me , when you come back from my house , you wo n't sneak any more . You do n't want to be hoggish , boys . " Jitney was still suspicious , but Clark was persuaded and willing . " Why not ? " he asked . " Let 's try it . " " Go on , " Acey urged . " Knock down a few more . They 're for yourselves . I 'll wait for you . " Jitney gave in . " All right , " sullenly he said . They attacked the remaining trees with sticks . Bats had a great time . Apparently he had been aching to sail into a tree with a club . But after five or six minutes Bats ' throwing arm was tired , and their enthusiasm for Acey 's scheme cooled . They saw they were gathering nuts subject to the possibility of being double-crossed . " These 'll be enough , " Jitney said . " Fine , " Acey said . He started ahead of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They hesitated . Then Bats grabbed one end manfully and made an attempt to hoist the bag on his back . Clark picked up the opposite end , and Bats started , staggering on the up-slope . " What the hell , " Jitney broke out . " Give it to me . " He grabbed Bats ' end and shoved Bats away . Jitney and Clark started up the hill with it , but their holds were wrong , and Clark labored ; all the nuts were at his end . Unnoticing , they had caught up with Acey , who waited for them . Clark was twisting , trying to change holds . " Here , boys . You have n't quite got hold of it right , " Acey said . " Let me show you , " and leaning over them as if to adjust the bag , his hands closed , there was a powerful jerk , they dropped the bag , and he had them , each by the wrist . He shed his affability and reasonableness like a man peeling off his coat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I been playing for this . " Businesslike , he dragged them by the wrists down to the pile of hulls . " ' Where 's that other bag of nuts ? " he de-manded wrathfully . " You tell me or I 'll scrub your faces with those hulls . You like walnut stains , see how you like it up your nose . I 'll make you eat hulls , god damn it . " He shook them . He was very strong . " Tell me . " " I do n't know nothing about another bag , " Jitney said . " What bag ? " asked Clark . " A bag of hulled walnuts , " Acey shouted , giving their arms another yank . " I was n't born yesterday , you two . Where there 's hulls , there 's nuts . " He pitched them on their knees in the hulls and yanked them up again . " You going to tell me ? " " I do n't know nothing , " Jitney insisted . " I do n't either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shove Acey sent Jitney spinning from him , yanked him to him again , reversing his wrist meanwhile , and jammed Jitney 's twisted right arm up his back . Jitney howled with the surprise and the pain of it . Acey leveraged the arm upward . He had Jitney straining tiptoe and grinding his teeth . " Stop it , stop it ! " Bats screamed , dancing round them dementedly . " It 's up by the road , " Jitney gritted out . " We took it up by the road . " " Whereabouts up by the road ? " Acey pried the arm farther . " We hid it up there behind a corn shock . " He was gasping the words out . Acey let up slightly . " You 're a liar , " he said , easing the torture in order to be emphatic . " A goddamned little Iiar . That bag 's round here , behind one of these bushes or a rock . You never had sense enough to take that bag out of here . Tell me . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm upward again . But the respite from pain and its renewal were more than Jitney could bear . Instead of answering , alternately he howled , screamed , howled . " This is what boys get that do n't respect private property , " Acey said inexorably . " Tell me or I 'll break your arm . Before God , I will . " He held Jitney firmly vised against his hip . The torture was unrelenting . " Do n't , do n't ! " Bats pleaded . He was jumping and dancing and sobbing too , maddened by Jitney 's howling , and , beside himself , finding his nutting stick still in his hand , he attacked Acey from behind , clubbing the man on the neck and shoulders . " Stop that , you little feist , " Acey roared , swinging round , but Bats stood his ground and clubbed wildly at his face . " Attaboy , " Jitney shouted , taking a swipe that was meant for Acey . He had untrussed his arm and he butted and struggled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark and tried to kick Acey in the groin . Acey let go of Jitney and with his right hand grabbed like a cat at Bats ' stick , but Bats was quick too , and Clark , ramming his head at Acey 's stomach , wrenched his wrist loose and ducked under Acey 's arm . Acey had Bats , but the other two were away . He jerked the stick from Bats ' hands . " Do n't you touch me , do n't you touch me ! " Bats screamed , and before Acey could cuff him , he threw himself down , dangling by his arm from Acey 's fist , and kicked and threshed in every direction . His shirt came out ; his knee-straps broke ; he plunged , rolled , twisted , flopped , and frothed . " Stand up , " Acey commanded , rigid with anger , the flat of his hand raised for a blow , " stand up . " But Bats could not be made to stand up . He sagged and spun and flopped , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stand up , " Acey roared , stamping his foot , and unexpectedly let go of Bats , prepared to boot him as he crawled away . But instead Bats dropped . He lay huddled on the ground , his screaming suffocating and choking in him , subsiding into sobs , and the angry man stepped back , a short uncertain backward step , breathing heavily . He mastered himself , and with his foot he rolled Bats over . Bats huddled on his face again and continued sobbing . Acey 's hands knotted ; he trembled , and abruptly he picked up the sack of walnuts , walked to the nearest tree , and swung the bagwith all his strength against the trunk . He repeated this , and finally rid himself of his rage by heaving the bag from him as far away as he could , down toward the ravine . There was a thud as the sack landed ; it was too dark now to see . Acey walked back to Bats . Bats was still sobbing and Acey left him alone . He drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he came back , Bats was still snuffling and he picked Bats up , limp as a rag , and stood him on the other side of the fence . Bats promptly slumped down again . " Go on , " Acey said , not unkindly . " Go on after the others . " He rattled the fence , making as if he were going to climb over , and Bats started . " You keep off my land , " he yelled after the others , climbing upon the fence . " You come on my property and I can do anything I like to you . Do you hear ? You keep off . " Jitney and Clark halted in the middle of the plowed field and waited for Bats . He trudged up and they congratulated him , slapped their hands on his shoulders , patted him . " Good work , Bats . " " Nice work . " Bats was apathetic . " The socko old Bats give him . " " God , he could 've murdered you , Bats . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , did he , Bats ? Did n't put a hand on you , did he ? God , I thought he was going to knock the tree down . " " You sure had him buffaloed , Bats . " " We 're going to give you a third of the nuts , " Jitney said . " You 've earned ' em . " Bats remained apathetic . " The big bully , " he muttered . They could n't liven him up . They waited in the field . They heard the staples creak when Acey got down from the fence . It must have been seven o'clock . In the plowed field the light from the stars was murky . After a considerable wait Jitney and Clark sneaked back . They both had the feeling that Acey had gone . Alone , Jitney rolled under the fence and slunk cautiously down to the grove . When Clark heard him in the leaves in the ditch he went under too , and together they lugged the sack of hulled walnuts up the hill to the fence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sack , Jitney reported in a whisper , that Acey had given a fling to , was so woozy with juice from the hulls battered against the tree-trunk that it would get stains all over them carrying it . There were n't many nuts in it anyway . They hurried along with the first sack . In the middle of the field they whistled for Bats and he answered ahead of them . By the cornfield they were talking again . Jitney was promising himself to beat up Acey 's oldest kid the first time he caught him in town . Even Bats picked up enough to say he 'd like to take a punch at the kid . They got the nuts into the road and went back for the bicycle . Bats had pushed it up to the fence and they lifted it over . " Say , " Bats complained peevishly , " where 's my cap ? I do n't want to lose that . " Jitney told him it had probably dropped off during the spill . They got the bicycle down in the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading the sack on the crossbar , Clark started on afoot with the bicycle , and Jitney went back to help Bats look . Bats was standing by the cornshock with his cap in his hand . " Heh , " Jitney said , " you got it in your hand . " Bats went right on kicking around the edge of the cornshock . " I had a bottle in it , " he explained . " I was carrying a little bottle in it . I was carrying it in here . " He indicated the lower portion of the lining as the cap hung vertically by the visor . " I ca n't find the bottle , " he whined . " How big a bottle ? " Bats indicated with his fingers . " I was delivering it for my father . I had to deliver it to old lady Cramer . I got to find the bottle . " " It 's good-by bottle , " Jitney said . " It went in the spill . " They both searched . " Here it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row of corn hummocks . It was a jar of vaseline . Bats grabbed it . " 1 got ta hurry with that , " he said . " If the old lady 's called my old man on the ' phone , I 'll catch it . " He ran down the clay hill after Clark . Jitney took it slower . The day was over , a good afternoon 's work , and walking , he would overtake Clark , pushing the bicycle , easily . Jitney tried the arm that Acey had twisted . His shoulder was going to go sore . At the foot of the hill he could hear Clark and Bats disputing . Clark had stopped . As he caught up to them Bats was claiming he had to have the bike to get back to town and deliver the damned jar , and Clark was trying to reason with him . Bats was dancing round , shaking the bike , and twisting the handlebars , so that Clark could n't proceed , and as Jitney came up Bats tried to tip the nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What the hell . Leave that alone , Bats . " " It 's my bicycle , " Bats shouted , " and I want it . You 've got to give it to me too . It 's my bicycle . " " We are n't hurting your bicycle , " Clark put in . " I want my bicycle . " " Aw , grow up , " Jitney said , and as Bats made another attempt to upset the sack from the crossbar , Jitney jumped and shoved him away . " Go on , Clark , " he said . " I 'll keep the little devil off . Listen , Bats . We are n't going to hurt your bicycle . " Bats tried to duck past him , after Clark , and jitney blocked him . Clark pushed along , hurrying , and Jitney kept between Bats and the bicycle . Suddenly Bats stopped , and as the others walked away from him , he threw himself down in the road and kicked and squalled . The farther they got from him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it to him , " Clark said , worried . " Nothing doing . " Bats ceased kicking and lay on his back , yelling bloody murder . " If an auto comes along . . " Clark suggested . " He 's goofy , Jits . " " Not that goofy ? " " Tell him if he do n't come we do n't give him his share of the nuts . " Jitney shouted this threatening information at the top of his voice . Bats ' squalling did not vary a note . It was impossible to know if he had heard . " Oh , hell , " Jitney burst out in a towering rage . " Give him his bicycle and I hope he breaks his neck . " From the crossbar Clark tipped the bag on Jitney 's shoulder . Too late Jitney remembered that his shoulder was sore . As soon as Bats saw Clark coming with the bicycle hegot up and walked down the road . He slipped the jar of vascline inside his shirt and mounted . " Hi , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . By God , it was too much . By God , if he had to carry the nuts in , he did n't want them . By God . . . His bunged knee was beginning to hurt something fierce . So did his shoulder . He threw the sack on the ground . The collar of his shirt was stained already . . . By God , what was the good of anything ? . . . Clark carried the walnuts . STONE OF MEMORY BY CHARMIAN LYNN MONTROSS T HIS house is mine , and it is big and dear As it has always been . There is no part Unloved in it and nothing changed this year Than was long years before , nor my own heart . And on the lawn the giant spruce tree stands , Marring the gentle twilight sky with blot Of scornful branches , shadow black . . . . The lands Are brown and sweet with scrambled earth still hot . There is no difference here . Strange that the sound Of shrieking children at their late hour 's play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That knew some others , playing this same way , Who , barely gone , have left me as a stone In memory of them . I am alone .
