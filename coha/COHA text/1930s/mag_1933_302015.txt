Other Chinese war lords and the Government fear him . Cultured Chinese statesmen , most of them proud of their foreign university degrees , call him a bumpkin and a clown . Perhaps no Chinese love him except the coarse , humble masses from which he sprang . Last week these chuckled as tall , mighty-bellied War Lord Feng Yu-hsiang returned with a broad , triumphal grin from his three-month military escapade in Chahar Province north of Peiping which nearly plunged Japan and China into fresh war ( TIME , June 5 , et seq . ) . <P> After capturing the outpost of Dolonnor from a mixed Manchukuo-Japanese garrison , smart Marshal Feng summoned all China to join his " struggle for righteousness . " This crucially embarrassed the Chinese Government of wasp-waisted Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek who had made and is striving to keep a precarious peace with Japan . For weeks Chinese patriots sent fighting funds to War Lord Feng , who had fancy arm bands with fighting mottoes expensively stitched on his soldiers ' sleeves , then suddenly announced , " I am going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week the Government of slim , shrill Generalissimo Chiang had to send a private train to bring huge , rumbling War Lord Feng triumphantly home from Chahar . He reached Peiping like a conqueror , traveling with an entire regiment as his bodyguard , grinning and cracking his barnyard jokes at " Chiang and his Government who think they can make themselves foreigners by putting on trousers , eating with knives and forks and leaping about on smooth dance floors clutching a woman ! " <P> In Peiping jovial Feng flatly denied that Japanese with bombing planes have recaptured Dolonnor . " Lies ! Lies ! " he grinned when told that the recapture had just been confirmed by both Chinese Premier Wang Ching-wei and the Japanese War office . Still grinning and munching ripe fruit , War Lord Feng pulled out of Peiping on his special train for Tientsin . Half way there he and his regiment changed to an armored train sent up from Shantung Province by his fellow war lord Governor Han Fu-chu of Shantung whom he appears to trust . Under Han 's protection Feng lived during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Confucius ' birthplace in Shantung , and proceeded to return there last week " as the climate is good for my asthma . " Chinese expected Feng 's " asthma " -a standing joke-to last until he sees a fresh chance to rush forth on another profitable military escapade . During his previous retirement the League of Nations Lytton Commission investigating Japan 's seizure of Manchuria tried to consult Feng on Taishan , were turned away by the excuse that he was ill . " <P> I was not ill ! " announced War Lord Feng unblushingly soon afterward . " I should have been humiliated to meet the League Commission . ... I am one of this country which , though it boasts a population of 450,000,000 can not safeguard its territory or protect its people , but instead begs the League for assistance . If this is not disgrace then what is disgrace in this world ? . . . Also it is to be regretted that the League Commission spent so much of its time sight-seeing instead of devoting itself to its mission . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
