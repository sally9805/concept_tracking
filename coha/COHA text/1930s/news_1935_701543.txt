txt THE POSTMAN FINALLY LEFT THESE On " Tobacco Road . " To the Drama Editor : I was gratified to see your news article stating that the stage play " Tobacco Road " had been banned by Mayor Kelly of Chicago . I attended the New York company 's presentation of this drama two weeks ago and found it disgusting . Furthermore , it is not a true characterization of the people it purports to portray . I lived for twenty-seven years in the hill country of Georgia and declare that the " hillbillies " are very much unlike Jeeter Lester and the other natives portrayed in " Tobacco Road . " For one thing , the " hillbillies " have a code of morals more rigid than that I have encountered anywhere else in the country . I agree with Mayor Kelly that the play has nothing to recommend it . If you take away its obscenity and its profanity there is nothing left . FARRELL M. CRAWFORD . Mount , N. Y. , Oct. 24 , 1935.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
