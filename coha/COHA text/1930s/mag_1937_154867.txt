In little England 's 49 counties , 38,173,950 inhabitants , there are enough queer characters to people a small planet . Some of these oddities are rich , most of them are eminently respectable . Last fortnight , when the British Museum bought the Ashley Library , a posthumous footnote was added to the career of one of England 's rich , respected , eccentric individuals . Thomas James Wise was not only the collector and owner of the world 's finest private collection of English literature . He was a literary forger . <P> Son of a successful businessman , Collector Wise succumbed to the bibliophilic passion early , sometimes went without his supper to buy some treasurelet from a secondhand bookstall . As his London produce business prospered , Thomas James Wise bought more &; more books , became known as Britain 's foremost book collector and bibliographer . He was a friend of the late great Algernon Charles Swinburne , Thomas Hardy , Joseph Conrad . He was frequently consulted as an authority on literary forgeries . Intimates smiled to each other about his harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hiding them away in a tin . At 74 , dome-browed Thomas James Wise was considered by his knowledgeable countrymen as very nearly a great man . <P> That he was also very nearly a great crook appeared before his 75th birthday .

It was a devastating investigation of an authoritative Wise catalog , proved up to the hilt that Thomas James Wise had for at least twelve years invented pedigrees for worthless books and pamphlets , passed off forgeries as genuine . Oldster Wise tried to bluster it out , finally retired in silence to his Hampstead house , lived secluded there until his death last May . <P> Forger or not , old Thomas Wise had done England more good than harm . His 7,000-volume library , whose catalog alone fills eleven large quartos , was offered to the nation at a price considerably less than its assessed quarter-million-pound value , in spite of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Wise library contains first editions of nearly every famous English poet from the time of Spenser , in drama ranges from Gammer Gurton 's Needle ( 1575 ) to Drinkwater 's Abraham Lincoln ( 1918 ) . What the British Museum Library actually paid to get this sizable addition ( biggest since 1846 ) was not divulged . Nothing official was said about the embarrassing subject , but it was unofficially felt that Thomas James Wise had paid his forger 's debt in full .
