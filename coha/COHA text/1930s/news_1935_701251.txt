txt So far housing has been one of the disappointments of the New Deal . A great deal has been promised but comparatively little accomplished . It takes time to plan , finance and design the new buildings and to acquire sites for them . All sorts of obstacles have been encountered , among them the inability of the public authorities themselves to make up their mind what they wanted to do and how they proposed to do it . Nevertheless , seven separate Federal bureaus are today actively engaged in housing work . While comparatively few " model tenements " or improved dwellings have yet taken form , extensive plans have been made and large sums of money set aside . The Government has already authorized a direct expenditure of $150,000,000 and has lately earmarked an additional $450,000,000 for that purpose out of the $4,880,000,000 Work Relief Bill . However , word has gone out that new housing , for all its permanent value , is to play a minor role in immediate relief efforts , because it requires such large expenditures for materials . In answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator WAGNER has recently introduced a bill known as the " Federal Public Housing Act of 1935 , " sponsored by the National Public Housing Conference . This bill starts out by declaring that " congested and insanitary housing conditions " throughout the nation " seriously affect " the public health , safety , morals and " welfare and undermine the standards " of living of the American people . " Correction of these conditions by private initiative is held impossible , and it is declared to be the policy of Congress that the Federal Government shall come to the rescue of the cities with " grants , loans and other assistance . " A division of housing is to be set up in the Department of the Interior to prepare and execute a " long " range slum clearance and low-rent " public housing program for the United " States , " and to make grants and loans to local public housing bodies for that purpose . The grants are not to exceed 30 per cent of the cost of labor and materials , and interest charges are not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sum of $800,000,000 is appropriated to carry out the purposes of the act . Here at least is a definite program for public discussion . Its principal advocates are those men and women who have long believed that this country ought to follow Europe 's example in subsidizing housing on a large scale . They do not go so far as the Social Democrats of Vienna , whose artless ideal was the provision of free housing for all those who could not afford to pay for shelter and still support a proper standard of living . Outright grants are to be limited , and unless Commissioner PoST has his way , some interest is to be charged . Local control of slum clearance and new housing is emphasized  --  a radical departure from the present system of practically unlimited Federal control . But Is the Federal Government ready to embark on so vast a venture ? Where is it to lay its hands on another $800,000,000 at this time ? What becomes of the limited dividend corporations , with their promise of private aid in this work as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the preamble , is housing legally a " public use . " and if so , has the Federal Government any constitutional right to enter this field ? Recent decisions have raised doubts on this score .
