 | Death from the Sky Condensed from The American Mercury ( February , ' 32 ) Arlington B. Conway THE Great War is now 13 years behind us . Aviation was then only in its infancy , and for the future propagandists threaten us with terrors a hundredfold greater than any it saw . What truth is there in this threat ? To gain an idea of what a present-day air power could effect , let us consider a war situation , imaginary as to belligerents , but actual as to geography and types and numbers of aircraft . Let us suppose that instead of peaceful Canada , with her ten war planes , the United States had for a neighbor Northland , a nation whose population , armament and warlike traditions were similar to those of France , the strongest air power in the world today . And let us suppose that this Northern neighbor was led to declare war on the United States . Northland has some i7oo airplanes , and her rulers are convinced that by striking prodigious blows by air at the great centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought to terms . New York is the most shining mark , and it is decided to reduce it to ruins first . Half an hour after the North- land ambassador has handed in his declaration of war , the air raiders cross the border . The raiding force consists of 140 heavy night bombers , and 530 faster and lighter day bombers . The Northern attack does not find the Americans entirely unprepared . When American Air Headquarters learns that enemy raiders are in the air , fighting squadrons are sent up , but intelligence collection and communications are faulty , and most of the American aircraft see nothing of the enemy . A few encounters take place , in which both sides lose machines . The result of the first day and night 's operations is that 80 percent of the attacking Northland aircraft drop their bombs on New York , the remaining 20 percent failing to reach the objective because of engine trouble , faulty navigation , and the action of the defense . Eighty percent of the total raiding force gives 112 night bombers and 424 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their loads in zoo-pound bombs . The night bombers which carry a ton of bombs will drop 2o each , or 2240 in all , and the day bomb-  | ers will drop 4 each , or 1696 in all , a grand total of 3936 aoopound bombs dropped in the day and night . Let us try to estimate what effect they would produce . We will suppose that the frightfulness is concentrated on Manhattan and the Bronx . The total area of these boroughs is 41,474 acres . Parks , streets and railways make up just over 40 percent of this area . The probability , then , is that of each zoo bombs discharged from the planes , 30 will fall in an open space too far from buildings to do any structural damage . This will reduce the effective number of bombs to 70 percent of 3936 , which is 2755 . An air bomb such as the ioopounders would make a crater as feet in diameter in average soil , or , if placed inside it , would destroy a one-story building r 8 feet square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each effective bomb will demolish whatever stands on an area 30 feet by 30 feet - 90o square feet , which equals .0206 of an acre . Our total of 2755 effective bombs will then destroy what stands on 56.8 acres . Now , we have calculated that of the total area of Manhattan and the Bronx some 24,884 acres are vulnerable , that is , covered with houses . Thus the result of the raid is that 56.8 acres out of 24,844 , that is , about .23 percent ( less than one quarter of one percent ) of the city , has been destroyed . To estimate casualties is more difficult . One bomb has been known to kill 20o and injure zoo more . Most of them kill nobody . Let us base our calculations on the effects of German bombs in Great Britain in the Great War . About 900o bombs of a total weight of 280 tons were dropped on various parts of Great Britain , in something over zoo raids . As a result 1413 persons were killed and 3408 injured . Almost exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City in 1928 alone . In those raids about 5o tons of bombs were dropped in London , and they killed 670 and injured 1962 . The density of the population in the county of London is 60.7 persons to an acre , while in the five principal boroughs of New York it is but 28.5 persons to an acre . Applying a correction for the difference , it is found that a ton of bombs dropped in New York would probably kill 6.3 persons and injure 18.1 . The total weight of bombs dropped is 393,60o pounds , or z9 ' 7 tons . Therefore the casualties would be about I 24o killed , and 356o injured . What the reaction of the New York populace to an attack such as I have sketched would be , I leave to some skilled mass psychologist to elucidate.  | Everyone would be very frightened . But I venture to predict that the punishment would not be enough to make the eagle scream for peace . But this is only one raid . What is to prevent the raids being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , first of all , the action of the defense . In the Great War the defending fighters could only patrol the skies , and had to find their enemies by their own observation . While it is easy to see an airplane from the ground , aircraft in flight will often not notice each other even when quite close together . The most important change in air fighting conditions since 1918 is that now aircraft can receive orders from the ground by radio . The Air Defense commander in his headquarters knows from his observers where the enemy are , and can direct his fighters to them . Radio communication to airplanes is not fully efficient yet , but it is being improved , and would be perfected rapidly under the stimulus of war . By this method of control the defense has gained enormously in power , and once the defense has been well organized , raiding aircraft will find themselves overwhelmed by a concentration of fighters more often than not . There is also anti-aircraft artillery . This branch of the gunner 's art developed slowly throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit anything was a standing joke with the troops , but statistics show that they were getting better all the time . Since the war very great improvements have been made in instruments for the control of fire . Some archie enthusiasts have exaggerated their powers , claiming that they will get one hit in zoo shots . This seems most improbable , but it is safe to say that anti-aircraft guns will be much more feared by airmen in future than they were in the World War . Defense against night raiders is more difficult . Searchlights are disposed in zones concentric to the place to be defended , so that the raiders must pass through them in attacking . Possibly two attacking planes out of three will escape the searchlight beams , but the one that is picked up becomes a target for anti-aircraft fire , and can be seen by patrolling fighters , who can machine-gun the dazzled raider with little fear of reply . It greatly heartens the earth-worms to see a raider caught in the ray , hear the exultant drone of a fighter swooping upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the darkness , watch the first flame break out on the stricken craft , and applaud its final roaring  | descent to earth , blazing like Lucifer and a slice of Hell . A proper air defense of New York would take some time to organize , but it would not be long before Northland raiders would have to discount a loss of from five to ten percent of their strength on each raid . In the last British air maneuvers 112 bombers attacked London . The umpires estimated that about 55 tons of bombs would have been dropped in three days and nights , but in achieving this result , 84 machines out of the 112 would have been put out of action . Let us now consider what the result would be if the bombs were filled with gas instead of explosives . The wiping out of whole populations by lethal vapors is a favorite vision , but no expert in the use of toxic gases supports it . J. B. S. Haldane has treated the subject in his Callinicus . He points out that the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and caused 4500 casualties , 50 of whom died . He estimates that the same amount of gas would have caused ten times the number of casualties if dropped on London , whose area is about the same as that gassed . This assumes that the population would have gas masks , and works out at ten pounds of gas to every casualty . I estimated above that the Northland air force could discharge 400o bombs in one day and night . If these bombs each had 30 pounds of liquid gas , a total of i 20,00o pounds would be dropped , and on the above basis would cause 12,00o casualties , of whom perhaps z2o might die . Haldane comes to the conclusion that gas , provided the civil population had respirators , would be much less effective as a terrorizing agent than high explosives , which I think is true . Still , a nation deliberately resorting to air frightfulness would probably mix gas bombs with explosives , hence all town-dwellers in the next war will be well advised to provide themselves with a good pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this precaution into practice . Haldane furthermore states that it is highly improbable that any substance for chemical warfare will be discovered whose noxious effects will greatly exceed those in use in 1918 . It is also true that high explosives of greater power are an extremely remote possibility . Never again , perhaps , will civilians sleep safe in their beds while the boys watch in the trenches . But on the other hand , air forces by themselves will never do to great cities what Rome did to Carthage , or what the Assyrians did to Jerusalem .
