txt Stadium Concert Deficits . For the past few days I have been reflecting on the possibilities of avoiding future deficits for the Stadium concerts . I suggest that the Fourth of July performance be wholly American . Then , instead of giving two performances of the same opera each week , I suggest two different operas . In this way the public will have the opportunity to hear a total of fourteen operas during the season rather than seven . The experience of the past season has shown a favorable public reaction to soloists , and common sense would urge that in the corning seasons a greater number of nights be reserved for such artists as Spalding , Heifetz , Ricci , &c.; As for the matter of assuring a capacity house for the Stadium throughout the season , I am sure a plan can be devised whereby department stores , publishing houses and corporations can distribute tickets to their patrons and employes .
