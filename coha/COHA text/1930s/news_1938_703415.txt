txt The cause of rapid transit unification in New York City is believed to have been considerably advanced by Federal Judge Robert P. Patterson 's decision on Saturday permitting the Interborough Rapid Transit receiver to disaffirm the 999-year lease of the Manhattan Railway Co. elevated properties . At the same time the Court upheld in large measure Interborough 's various contracts with the City . The decision is expected to : 1 . Spur the New York State Constitutional Convention , now in progress . to early action in adopting an amendment permitting the City to effect unification with bonds issued outside its debt limit ; 2 . Enhance Interborough 's bargaining position in the current unification discussions , although not to the same extent as would have proven true if disaffirmance of contracts with the City had been allowed ; 3 . Impair the bargaining position of the Manhattan parties , and advance proposal of the Merle-Smith Manhattan bondholders ' protective committee to sell the Sixth Avenue elevated line to the City for *12. - 500,000 , less the amount of back taxes overdue . Effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unexpected , some transit observers predicted that the decision might not materially , affect the market for Interborough issues . Especially was this considered true in the light of the fact that the securities already have had a substantial advance this year on unification hopes . Because of the importance of the issues involved . Judge Patterson granted an immediate stay as to return of the Manhattan lines to the owners pending appeals to higher courts . It is anticipated that all of the main issues involved in the decision will go to the Circuit Court of Appeals early next Fall . and from there to the United States Supreme Court some time during 1939 . All of the interested parties , including the City and the Transit Commission as well as the IRT and Manhattan sides . are expected to take exceptions to the rulings in the case . Threat of Higher Fare on Manhattan The decision brought a threat by Manhattan to charge a higher fare for local service on its lines in the event of independent operation . While Interborough by the terms of the decision is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan Railway lease , the necessity for continuing operation of the elevated extensions built by the I.R.T. itself , as well as for providing free transfers to the Manhattan line at 149th Street . will prove a fairly sizable drain upon its subway earnings should these two portions of the ruling be upheld in the final adjudication of the case . Present indications are that Inter/30/3110h from subway operations is falling short of covering charges on its mortgage bonds , but this debt service includes the heavy sinking fund requirements of the refunding mortgage 55 . The receiver recently estimated that he will have available by June 30 roughly $4.800.000 to meet the 35.581.650 interest due July 1 on the bonds . Reaction to Decision The reaction of all parties to the decision . which came just after the close of Saturday 's short session on the Stock Exchange , was immediate . Notwithstanding the fact that the ruling was considered as upholding some of the City 's contentions in the case , Mayor La . Guardia announced that it would immediately be appealed and blamed the Transit Commission for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved the entire matter . A. reaction somewhat similar to Mayor La Guardia'a came from Judge Samuel Seabury , former negotiator for the City on rapid transit . Charles Franklin , counsel for the Manhattan Railway , indicated that the decision in its broader aspects contained some favorable implications for Manhattan security holders . After pointing out that an application for an increased fare had been authorized by the Manhattan board of directors , Mr. Franklin said that affirmance of the extension certificate would mean that Interborough must now make different arrangements not only in regard to passengers coming on to the Manhattan lines from the Interborough-owned extensions but also with respect to power taken from the Manhattan-owned plant . Lease Held Burdensome In directing disaffirmance of Manhattan lease , Judge Patterson held that there was ample proof that the lease is burdensome to the Interborough and that if payments of rent are to be made , they must , in part at least , come out of what the receiver earns on subway operations . The minimum fixed rental called for by the lease as readjusted since 1922 exceeds 53,500,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and $2,000,000 in bond interest and dividends . Judge Patterson discussed Interborough 's extension ' certificate with the City , which he called the " instrument of prime importance in the case " . While holding that this contract was primarily in the nature of a franchise and must be affirmed , he rejected the contention of the City and the Manhattan parties that because of it Interborough is bound to operate the Manhattan lines in conjunction with the extensions for the 85 years of the certificate . He ruled that the receiver may not by disaffirming the Manhattan lease disable himself from performing Interborough 's engagements under the certificate . In concluding his decision , Judge Patterson said : " From what has been said , it follows that the receiver in behalf of the Interborough creditors may disaffirm the lease of the Manhattan lines and return those lines to the lessor or lessor 's receiver ? ? ? and for their damages for breach of contract the Manhattan bondholders will file claims against the Interborough estate .
