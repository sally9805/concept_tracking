Among the 2,300 men and women in the U. S. who run private secondary schools , unique is the position of Elliott Speer , 32 , Princeton 1920 ; son of famed Evangelist Robert Elliott Speer . He not only conducts the largest private secondary institution in the land but as President of Northfield Schools ( enrollment : 1,230 ) he heads two schools-Mount Hermon School for boys and Northfield Seminary for girls . These seats of learning face each other across five miles of wooded hills , separated by the Connecticut river near Northfield , one mile from the northern boundary of Massachusetts . <P> Fifty years ago these schools were founded by Evangelist Dwight Lyman Moody as a place where disadvantaged boys and girls might receive a preparatory education at small cost . As the institution has progressed and expanded it has lost much of its early religious flavor . It now likes to be known as a purely educational institution , being at pains to make clear that the celebrated annual Northfield Religious Conferences are merely held on the school grounds during vacations , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this its semicentennial year , there is now in progress a drive for $3,000,000 to increase faculty pay , provide a teacher-retirement fund , secure upkeep for the physical property . Last week President Speer was happy to announce that one-half of the fund had been raised , that an appeal for funds had been laid before Edward Stephen Harkness , a seemingly inexhaustible source of educational charity ( $26.000,000 to Yale and Harvard in three years ) . * <P> Northfield 's purpose is twofold : it provides an education for the worthy indigent , it supplements the public school facilities of backward communities . Each member of the community works some part of each day , earns 64% of his or her keep . Thus when Arthur Curtiss James gave Mount Hermon a gymnasium not long ago , the inmates turned out and filled , graded , drained , seeded a playing field which would have cost $10,000 . <P> Of the alumni , some have done decidedly well . Among them : President Chester Irving Barnard of New Jersey Bell Telephone Co. , President James Lukens McConaughy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill School , Radioman Lee De-Forest , Actor Glenn Hunter . <P> <P> *Last week it was announced that Donor Harkness intended to give $25,000,000 more to the Pilgrim Trust " for the benefit of Britain .
