The slogan of most opposition parties in Europe might well be the battle cry that punsters once pinned on U. S. Socialist Norman Thomas : " Cast away your votes and follow me ! " Oppositionists are purged in Russia , shot in Germany , castor-oiled in Italy , executed in Spain , while in most of Central Europe their continued existence is dependent upon the utter impossibility of their ever winning an election . Last week two big opposition party congresses - Labor in England ( see p. 24 ) and Socialist in France-demonstrated that even in Europe 's democracies , where oppositionists are not considered criminals , enemies of the State , traitors , wreckers , boors or madmen , opposition parties are having too much trouble holding together to think of taking power . <P> In the huge Palais de l'Alimentation in Nantes , the chief interest of some 8,000 Socialists was watching ex-Premier Lon Blum , party president for 15 years , fight a losing battle with his old friend , 61-year-old , thin-lipped , General Secretary Paul Faure . <P> Ever since Munich Blum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franco-Soviet Pact , a united front against aggressors . He has supported Premier Daladier 's foreign policy since that policy edged away from appeasement , even traveled to London to persuade the Labor Party to abandon its traditional fight against conscription . <P> This was heresy to practical , pro-Munich Paul Faure . Colorless , competent , cautious , he has been political organizer of the party as Blum has been its intellectual head . Heir of the pre-War traditions of French Socialism , he plumped for peace above all , insisted that " the day the Fascist nations believe themselves encircled they will certainly go to war . " Support for rearmament came hard for him because he made a reputation exposing armament makers , earned the enmity of powerful Armorer Charles Schneider . He was thus squarely opposed to his friend Lon Blum when their party 's annual Congress came round . <P> At Nantes , where hotels were so full some delegates had to make special arrangements , tolerantly giving up their rooms to prostitutes when necessary , the ex-Premier went into battle controlling a majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against aggressor nations abroad , continuation of the Popular Front , with Communists included , at home . The vote : 5,490 against , 1,761 for .
