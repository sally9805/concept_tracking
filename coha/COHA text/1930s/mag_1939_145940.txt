The U. S. major-league baseball parks seat altogether about 700,000 fans . For millions of other followers of baseball , next best thing to a seat in the bleachers is to hear a game over the radio . This week the radio starts its biggest baseball season in history . <P> For the first time every major-league team will have at least one sponsor . Procter &; Gamble Co. , for example , will broadcast some of the New York Yankees , Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers games to boost Ivory Soap . Atlantic Refining Co. - sponsoring a share of the games of the two Boston teams , the two Philadelphia teams , the Pittsburgh Pirates and a host of minor leaguers-will give players $5 books of gas- &-oil; coupons for home runs and shutouts . Socony-Vacuum will cover twelve major-league teams , many minors . Biggest plunger of all will be a perennial baseball sponsor , General Mills Inc. , with 14 major-league teams ( all but the Boston Bees and Red Sox ) and most of the minors , playing their hearts out for its Wheaties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hot liner over second . Boy , Ducky-Wucky Medwick must have had a heaping dish of Wheaties this morning . " ) has become a running gag among baseball players , but it sells . The biggest ( 230 Ibs. ) and the best Wheaties ' announcer , 37-year-old Arch McDonald from Arkansas , adds a lingo of his own . A baseball buff from boyhood and a baseball announcer for the last eight seasons , Arch McDonald has the job of covering the home games of the World Champion Yankees and the Giants this season over WABC . He will collect a salary of $25,000 , will broadcast in turn for Wheaties , Mobiloil and Mobilgas , Ivory Soap . <P> Big , bearlike , bluff , Arch McDonald attracted a huge following during four years as " Ambassador of Sports " at Washington 's WJSV . Rabid fan John Nance Garner called him " the World 's Greatest Baseball Announcer . " Thousands cheered him when he once dared obscene and unidentified telephoners to meet him somewhere and fight like men. * When he broke his ankle last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneaked past guards , climbed through transoms , even hid in ambulances to visit Arch . Those who could n't get in shouted questions at his window , and Arch shouted answers back . <P> One reason Arch McDonald is high favorite of the fans is that he avoids the hackneyed " hot-corner , " " keystone-sack " school of baseball idiom . With Arch a pitcher is a pitcher , not a twirler ; a catcher catches , he does not " do the receiving chore . " The lingo he uses is his own or fresh from the dugout . Announcing a double play , for example , Arch is likely to report laconically : " two dead birds " ; his fans know an easy fly as " a can of corn , " an easy , high-hopping grounder as " Big Bill , " a curve ball as " No. 2 , " and a slow ball as " the set of dishes . " A pitcher easy for a particular batter to hit is that batter 's " cousin . " A hard hitter " lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducks on the pond . " <P> <P> *A sure way to pick a fight with Arch McDonald is to touch him with peach fuzz . He has a holy horror of it , once broke the jaw of a joker who rubbed some on him .
