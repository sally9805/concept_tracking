When Depression struck in 1929 , unemployment was a problem for which the U. S. was totally unprepared . Last week , such was not the case . On the contrary , Recession 's latest unemployment peak came just in time to coincide with two New Deal schemes especially designed to deal with it . <P> Riggers ' Figures . First step in solving any problem is to find out what the problem is . Last autumn , Franklin Roosevelt appointed President John D. Biggers of Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. to make the first census of U. S. unemployment . Mr. Biggers went to work at $1 a year , with a $5,000,000 appropriation and the aid of the Post Office Department . Last November , 81,000,000 unemployment blanks were distributed by letter-carriers to 32,000,000 U. S. homes . As the returns came in , a separate door-to-door census checked them in 1,864 areas scattered at random about the U. S. <P> Last week , Mr. Biggers ' figures were complete enough to be presented to the President . Total number of people who had voluntarily returned questionnaires listing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Door-to-door census covering 1,950,000 persons indicated , however , that this was only about 72% of the people who , when ferreted out and interviewed , classed themselves as unemployed . On this basis total unemployed population of the U. S. would be 10,870,000 . Said Mr. Biggers : " We do not claim provable accuracy for any one figure . The true number of those who considered themselves totally unemployed . . . lies between 7 , - 822,912 , the number who responded to the registration , and 10.870,000 , the number indicated by the enumerative census . " Day after the nationwide figures were released , Mr. Biggers issued a supplementary report revealing the status of unemployment by States . New York headed the list with 969,840 . <P> Not yet completely analyzed , Mr. Biggers ' figures showed that of the questionnaire total , 2,000,000 considered unemployed were actually at work on relief jobs . Nearly 6,000,000 were men , nearly 2,000,000 women . Difficulty of interpreting the census-beyond weeding out cards from people who had misunderstood them even more completely than the 20% who , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs-was where to draw the line between regular workers and housewives , sons of families , dependents , retired workers who work only at intervals . Mr. Biggers proposed that his census be further checked by a " cross-sectional enumeration of our test areas " to make his figures more informative . <P> Main inaccuracy of the census was obviously the fact that , while it included the first month of Recession , unemployment has grown more acute in the last month . Current unofficial estimates of the total number of workers who have lost their jobs since September average 2,000,000 . In Detroit last week , in the biggest mass layoff of Recession , President William S. Knudsen of General Motors announced that 30.000 of the company 's 235,000 employes would be laid off as of January 3 and that employes who remained on the payroll would operate on a threeday , 24-hr , week .
