U. S. universities have been raided heavily since 1933 by Washington . Last week the tables were turned when Northwestern University robbed Washington of one of its most brilliant young men , 41-year-old Fred Dow Fagg Jr. , who in seven months , as Director of the Bureau of Air Commerce , had transformed that division from an Administration headache to a smile . <P> It was a counterraid , for Washington had taken Dr. Fagg from Northwestern . A teacher of economics and law for 15 years-at Harvard , University of Southern California and the Institut fur Luftrecht in Konigsberg , Germany , as well as Northwestern-Dr . Fagg , a Wartime liver , founded and headed the Institute of Air Law in Chicago in 1929 , became so authoritative an expert in his subject that the Federal Government drafted him as part-time legal adviser in 1934 , later asked him to help revise the civil air regulations . <P> Last March , with the Bureau of Air Commerce under fire from a Senate investigating committee as result of a series of plane crashes , Dr. Fagg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director . He went quietly to wort , reorganizing the bureau , established a safety and planning division that began to study more and better safety devices for pilots . By last week , when President Walter Dill Scott made a tempting offer to him to return to Northwestern , bureau officials and the industry at large were sorry to see him go . <P> The plum with which Dr. Fagg was tempted was the deanship of Northwestern 's School of Commerce . At Northwestern , as at several other institutions , the business school has become the biggest branch of the university . <P> When Joseph Wharton , Philadelphia business man , founded the first one at University of Pennsylvania in 1881 , the first students were for the most part rich young men who came to learn how to manage their private property . But as the complexity and salaries of U. S. business management increased , so did the demand of young men and women for training to set them on the road to wealth . Today some 80 universities have schools of business administration with over 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrators , lawyers , teachers . <P> Wharton School of Finance and Commerce , best and most famed , gives training in such fields as accounting , banking , brokerage , foreign commerce , industrial relations , manufacturing , public affairs , transportation &; public utilities .

The biggest , at New York University ( some 10,000 students ) , has a branch near Wall Street . Northwestern 's main centre is a few minutes from Chicago 's Loop . <P> Like schools of law and medicine , they have leading practitioners of business lecture to their students . Industrialists come in with undergraduates to fill gaps in their knowledge . Students may take the full four-year course-two years of liberal arts and two of business-or less , may attend classes by day or night .
