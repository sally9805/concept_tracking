From Arica , Chile , this week came a newspaperman 's snapshot of the recent 8th Pan-American Conference at Lima , Peru , which did not coincide with the Conference 's official picture . <P> New York Times Correspondent John W. White wrote : " The .. . Conference . . . functioned under a dictatorial regime of censorship , intimidation and spying such as never before seen in any Pan-American assembly . The Peruvian Government not only tried to control the newspaper correspondents , it censored and spied on the delegates . . . . Secret service men were found searching the offices of the American delegation . . . . The Government . . . violated diplomatic immunity and examined the delegates ' mail . Many chauffeurs assigned to the delegates were known to be in the employ of the secret police . . . . Peru used at least two agents provocateurs in its campaign to intimidate visiting correspondents . . . . The censor cut the telephonic communication of Leland Stowe on two occasions while he was dictating his dispatch to the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies are intensely fascist , " continued Mr. White , " and the Government was furious at the disclosure of German and Italian activities against the Pan-American Conference . On the opening day . . . Lima appeared to be the site of a great Nazi rally . There were literally thousands of swastika flags all over the city . There were only three American flags on the main street , and one of them was at the American Consulate . Also there were more Italian and Japanese flags than there were flags of any South American countries . Throughout the Conference the Government-controlled newspapers used prominent headlines on everything the totalitarian leaders said against the Conference . "
