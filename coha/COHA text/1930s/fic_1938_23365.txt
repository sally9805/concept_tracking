 --  ? t footio , 001. vivA THE WILLOW FLY A OR r BY EUGENE WRIGHT nOPPY , Poppy ? The name had a fa- . r miliar sound . . . . And then I remembered a time past when Poppy had the same meaning for us trout fishermen that Stutz and Stephens-Duryea had for the automobile bugs . Poppy meant trout flies , the kind of flies you could afford about once a year and would spend half a day to get one out of a tree rather than Jose it , flies so cunningly tied that you heard stories of birds having taken them on the cast and being fought like trout . And this back in the days when fly-fishing was apostate and we were the laugh of the town with our gamecock feathers and rods of Tonkin steel . Sure I remembered the name ; I still had a few Will Poppy flies , and so I told Doctor Black . " And you 'll catch trout with those flies , " he said . " You 'll be catching trout with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Will Poppy was a fish-erman ? " " Will Poppy ? " I said . " Will Poppy , " he said . " You were talking about trout fishermen a minute ago . Will was a real one . " It never had occurred to me that the name of those trout flies might be a human being . I could n't have thought of Will Poppy that way any more than I would have believed that there was a real Mr. Stephens-Duryea who had chilblains or a Mr. Pullman who would n't eat anything on his cars except oatmeal ; and even now that Doctor Black had vouchedfor the fact that Will Poppy was a fisherman I felt skeptical : you 've got to see a real fisherman in action before you can form an opinion on him ; when I met the United States champion bait caster I discovered he practiced on empty tomato cans and had never caught a bass in his life . " Is that so ? " I said . " It is so , " he said , " and if people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd revise their opinions about fishermen in general . " He turned round then to his instrument table where he was grinding up a filling for my tooth and I knew that he was getting back at me for that crack I had made about doctors and dentists always talking about trout-fishing but never going , by which I meant that if he was really as nuts about fishing as he had led me to believe for the past few years he would forget his patients for a week and join me on the Ausable in June . So I said , " Whom would you call a real fish-erman ? " " That depends on who the fisherman is , " he said . " Mr. Roosevelt is a real fisherman and he 's President of the United States , and old Fred Higgins out your way is a real fisherman and he 's kept two clinics going for the past two years on his own money . " " Coolidge was no fisherman , " I said . " Neither is Hoover . " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never met either of those gentlemen . But I know Will Poppy was . Ever fish the Esopus ? " " Once or twice . " " Will lived up on the Esopus . Made his flies up there and died up there . Killed by an automobile . He supported his mother and three sisters by fly-tying for seven years and I do n't think he wet a line twice the whole time . I 've seen his house so filled on Saturdays and Sundays with half-wit fishermen waiting for him to tie up copies of some fly they 'd picked up off the stream before the rise stopped that his sisters had to go round to the back of the house to get in . " Before that though Will used to fish all the time . I used to think I was pretty good myself in those days  --  I 'd just started my practice then , and two or three times a year I 'd manage to get up on the Esopus . " I got up there one year in July , the hatches practically over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waste of effort to put a rod together . My leader made a shadow on the bottom like the limb of a tree . It was about five in the afternoon and I was fishing upstream about a half-mile below Phoenicia . " Not a rise . They would n't even look at it . And I was using those flies they were just beginning to import into this country from England . Nothing doing . Then along about sundown I see this fellow ahead of me . He had on a pair of overalls , no boots . Well , I always enjoyed seeing nice casting so I got out of the stream , sat down and watched him . He was working a riffle just below a big pool . " I watched him for about a half-hour , trying to figure out how he did it . His cast seemed orthodox , but it was the way he retrieved his line that interested me . I could n't describe it to you except by saying that his line did n't appear at any time to touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if it had touched . He had several strikes  --  his rod went up now and then ; but he did n't pay any attention to them and finally he 'd worked up to the lip of the pool . " I 'd begun to take a kind of fancy to him by this time . It 's not often , you know , that you see a man using a fly as you 'd like to use it yourself . Some of these experts are so tricked out in waders and nets that it 's painful to watch ' em . The older they get the farther they seem to drift away from what trout-fishing really is . But this fellow  --  well , I felt somehow that he understood  --  the real McCoy as they say nowadays . It did n't make any difference to me if he never caught a fish ; I knew he was a fisherman . " He got a strike in that pool  --  a good one . The water boiled over and a big tail came up about a yard away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I knew the fish was in the air way up near the rapids  --  as fine a rainbow as you 'd want to see . He broke water five times before Will netted him ; by then I 'd come close enough to speak . " I said , ' That 's a fine fish you 've got there . ' " He did n't talk just then . He had the rainbow under water in his net and seemed to be searching for something in one of his front pockets . And it was a little metal tag . He clipped it onto the rainbow 's dorsal fin and let him go . " Will was only about eighteen then  --  still a kid in some ways . But in another way he seemed older than I was . It was the expression round his eyes and mouth , and a certain way he had of looking at you . It was a surprised look  --  as though he was wondering how you fitted in , what he could do about it . Like a buck deer 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ? ' " He looked at the fly on his leader and then up at me again . He said , ' It 's a willow fly . ' " I 'd never heard of a willow fly , but it was the smallest trout fly I 'd ever seen in my life . If you remember that far back , that was when they were using eights and sixes  --  sometimes even fours . This one was about the size of a big mosquito . " I said , ' Where 'd you get it ? ' He said , ' I made it , ' and he showed me a whole box of them  --  all irregular sizes but very small ; he 'd even made the hooks . Later ? WV of course you could buy sixteens and twenties . " He gave me a couple of those ' willow ' flies of his and I took three trout out of that pool a little farther up without moving from my position . " I saw quite a lot of Will that summer . He worked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to stay at a boarding house near where that road branches off the stream to go to Woodstock . I used to fish that stretch from there right on up to Phoenicia . Will was driving then , and I 'd see him go by every morning along the road with his team , one foot up on the brake and always leaning toward the side the stream was on , not looking at the stream especially , but leaning that way . Never hollered when he passed by  --  just raised his whip . About sundown I 'd catch a glimpse of him on the stream , wading in here and there , sometimes just standing still and looking . " I went over to see Will at the dairy one day and they told me he had gone to Phoenicia . They told me where he lived . I had lost the flies he 'd given me , and I wanted to know if he 'd make me a dozen or so on a business basis . I got a man with a buckboard to drive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever went up to Phoenicia on the train  --  short , thin fellow , rather stooped ? He was baggageman at the station for about fifteen years . Well , I smelled medicine the moment they opened the door . Doctor was there , Will and his sisters were in the parlor . It smelled like a place where somebody 'd been sick for years . " I stayed only a minute ; nothing I could do . The doctor seemed like a good one . " Doctor Black put a wad of cotton in my cheek and leaned over me . " And that was the last time I saw Will Poppy , " he said , " for about four years . My own practice began to pick up ; then I married and started having a family of my own . But every once in a while I 'd think about Will and wonder how he was getting on . " But I was n't the only fisherman who knew Will Poppy 's flies . I had to go up to Binghamton one day , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what the place looked like . Roads were very bad over the mountains then ; I did n't get to Phoenicia until after dark . There was a sign hanging out in front of Will 's house which I could n't read at the time , but there was a light in the parlor , and I could see Will from the porch bending over one of those little vises that fly-tiers use . " He let me in and I sat down for a while . He did n't have to tell me what had happened . There was a different smell in the house now , and it was quiet ? but very busy somehow . His sisters working out in the kitchen ; Will tying flies . The room was filled with flies . " I said , ' Did anybody ever catch that big rainbow you let go ? ' Well , he said , he could n't say as to that , although there 'd been a lot of fishing on the stream during the past several years . He said he guessed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . " I said , ' Ca n't you get somebody to help you out here ? ' " He thought not ; his flies were just beginning to get known round the country and he felt he ought to keep on tying them himself . He said his sisters helped him sort out feathers and strip hackles . " Well , you know how those flies sold . I stopped in at a big sporting goods store in New York one day ; they had a whole tray of ' em on display with Will 's name stuck up on a card . I said , ' Are they any good ? ' and the clerk took his breath in for a minute and looked me up and down . He said , ' They 're three seventy-five a dozen . ' And they were all twelves and fourteens  --  except his ' willow ' fly . They called it ' Will 's Willow ' and it was tied on number twenties . Ever try to tie a number twenty ? " I said I did n't see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " It was done about fifty times a day . " Then after a while he said , " Did you ever fish the McCloud ? " " Yes , " I said . " I 've fished the Sacramento too . " " I never tried the Sacramento , " Doctor Black said . " But I did fish the McCloud . I got a call out there some years ago . A fellow 'd been kicked by a horse and they wanted a specialist . It was urgent , so I went . Took my wife along for a little vacation . " It took me two weeks to patch that man 's mouth up . Fractures in upper and lower jaws , teeth very bad . I had to set them in gold . And I had it in the back of my head to try the McCloud when I 'd finished so I stopped in at a sporting goods store on Market Street in San Francisco one afternoon to buy some flies . Of course there was only one kind I wanted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those big stores with mounted game heads everywhere you looked . But they did n't . " ' Ever heard of ' em ? ' I said . Yes , the clerk said he 'd heard of them . Matter of fact , they 'd bought all they could get until they stopped making them . " ' Stopped making them ? ' I said . " ' Well , we could n't get any more , ' the clerk told me . ' We wrote Mr. Poppy and we never got a reply . ' " I could n't understand that . I felt pretty sure if anything had happened to Will I 'd have heard about it . Well , I bought some of the English flies , but just on a hunch that night I sent a telegram to Will ordering a couple of dozen fan-wing Coachmen and telling him to send them to me at Redding , California , where I was going to stay . I was n't thinking so much about the flies although I wanted them . I did n't even think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole two dozen . They got to Redding about ten days after I arrived . " Well , there was something strange about those flies . I could n't believe they were his even though he 'd sent them . The hackles were fuzzy . They bunched up round the eye of the hook the way a fly should n't . But the manner of tying was his  --  and I caught fish with them . They were better than the English flies . " Doctor Black untied the bib from round my neck and took it with him to the window . " I saw Will only once after that , " he said , " before he got hit by the automobile . Will was twenty-six then and it was July , just about the time when I 'd first met him . I was fishing that stretch below Phoenicia , the same water I always fished , and it was clear and low . And Will was up ahead of me , casting . We were the only two fishermen on the stream . " I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the stream when I saw him . I think it was the overalls that caught my eye . He was working the riffles out in the middle , just below the big pool and he had a stick that he 'd poke ahead of him . I watched him for a long time before I could believe it was Will . And even then I would n't have believed it was Will except for the way he fished . " You could n't see his fly . You had to guess where it was dropping , or going to drop . Not floating much , just always dropping , dropping where you could n't see it ; and the rod flashing and Will standing there bent over a little with the stick under his arm and his net trailing in the current behind him and his hand feeling the line , bringing it in and letting it out again ; and the fly falling where you could n't see it . And all the time working forward , taking his time , feeling his way into the pool , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . " I did n't see the strike , but I saw his rod go up ; and out on the big pool there was a little ripple , as though the water was flowing over a stone , and then the line began to cut through the water , straight upstream , and his rod was shaking and Will was motionless , leaned a little forward with his elbows close to his sides and the line going out , slipping away , and his rod perpendicular , bent only at the tip . " The trout leaped from the swift water near the rapids  --  twice : the first time straight up from the bottom ; the second time in an arc , so fast you 'd have thought there were two trout with metal tags on their fins , pink bellies and big square tails ; and when he came downstream there was a wave behind him and Will 's rod had not moved from the perpendicular , yet the line was taut . I never knew the man who could keep a big rainbow out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never before saw a rainbow held for more than a minute on a horsehair leader and a number twenty hook . Will held that rainbow for close to an hour and every minute of it he held him in the pool . He beached him on a shoal and followed down the line with his hand , and when he felt the tag on the big fin he laughed like a boy , and he was looking straight at me . I said ' Hello , Will , ' and he recognized my voice . He came toward me , feeling his way over the stones , and I saw that he was blind . " SONG BY FREDERIC PROKOSCH W HEN dusk caresses all our heads , When all the curtains touch the sill , When darkness cloaks the heaving beds And torches dot the hill , When ships divide the intriguing night , When lust new agonies explores , When sailors watch the flickering light Along their luckless shores .
