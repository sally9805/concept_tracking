dawn he was up and on his red horse and the horse was curvetingand impatient in the chill air and his hoofs thudded heavily upon the cobbled street and the pocked lad , well fed with all he had eaten for his morning meal , was on his ass and they rode around to the gate of Wang the Eldest to fetch that other lad . But before they could wait at all a man servant came running out of the gate and he cried as he ran somewhere , " What a thing of evil is thiswhat a curse upon this house ! " And he ran his way somewhere . Then Wang the Tiger felt his impatience rise in him and he shouted out , " What curse is it ? Curse it is that the sun is near the horizon and I am not on my way yet ! " But the man did not look back . Then Wang the Tiger cursed very heartily and he cried to the pocked lad , " That cursed lad your cousin is nothing but a burden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and tell him he is to come or I will not have him ! " The pocked lad slid down at once from his small old ass and ran in and more slowly Wang the Tiger came down from his horse and went to the gate and gave the reins over to the gateman to hold for him . But before he could go further the lad was out again , white as a spirit and breathing as fast as though he had run around the town walls . He gasped out . between his breaths , " He will never come againhe is hung and dead ! " " What do you say , you small monkey ! " shouted Wang the Tiger and he leaped and ran into his brother 's house . There was confusion indeed and men and women and servants and all were gathered about something in the court , and above the din and shouting a woman 's loud shrieks were heard , and it was the lad 's mother who so cried . But Wang the Tiger pushed them aside and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat face was yellow as old tallow and all shaken with tears , and he held supported in his arms the body of his second son . The lad lay there outstretched in the court , under the bright morning sky , dead , and his head hung back over his father 's arm . He had hanged himself with his girdle upon the beam in the room where he slept with his elder brother , and the brother had not known it until he woke in the morning , for he slept hard after wine at some merrymaking the night before . When he woke in the pale dawn and saw the slight form dangling he thought at first it was a garment and he wondered why it hung there but when he looked again he screamed and so woke the house . Then Wang the Tiger , when one had told him this tale and a score of others helped in the telling , stood and looked down on this dead sonPIOIwith the strangest feeling , and he pitied this lad for a while as he never had when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slight now he was dead . And Wang the Eldest looked up and saw his brother there and he blubbered , " I never dreamed this child of mine would choose death to going with you ! You must have treated him very ill to make him hate you like this ! Well for you that you are my brother , or I would-I would " " No , Brother , " said Wang the Tiger more gently than he was used to speak , " I did not treat him ill . He even had an ass to ride when others older than he walked . But neither did I dream he was brave enough to die . I might have made something of him after all if I had known he had in him the power to die ! " He stood and stared awhile . But bustle began suddenly when the serving man who had run somewhere returned with a geomancer and with priests and their drums and with all those whose duty it is to come with such an untoward death , and in the commotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . But when he had waited and done all that he should do as brother in so sad a house he mounted his horse and he rode away . And as he went he was sadder than he had been and he was compelled to harden himself and to remember again and again how he had never beaten the lad or treated him ill in any way and none could have known he had this despair in him to take his own life , and Wang the Tiger told himself it was so destined by heaven and not any man could have averted this thing , for so the life of everyone is wholly with heaven . Thus he forced himself to forget the pale lad and how he had looked when his head lay over his father 's arm , and Wang the Tiger said to himself , " Even sons are not all blessing , it may be . " When he had comforted himself like this he was better , and he called heartily to the pocked lad , " Come , lad , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " WHEN Wang the Tiger struck his horse with the braided leathernwhip he carried and he let the beast have its full way and the horse sped over the countryside as though it were winged . It was a day fit to start upon so high a venture as Wang the Tiger 's , for the sky was cloudless and the wind blew keen and cool and full of vigor and it turned the trees this way and that and wrenched at them and whipped the late leaves from their branches and it stirred thepIO2dust in the roadways and whirled itself over the shorn grain lands . In Wang the Tiger 's heart a recklessness rose like the very wind itself and he purposely took his way far from the earthen house and he made a wide circle from the place where Pear Blossom lived and he said to his own heart , " All the past is finished and I look forward to my greatness and to my glory ! " So the day began and the sun rose full and enormous and glittering over the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it seemed to him that heaven itself set its seal upon him in such a day as this and he would achieve his greatness , for greatness was his destiny . Early in the morning he came to the hamlets where his men were , and his trusty harelipped man came out to meet him and he said , " It is very well , my captain , that you have come , for the men are rested and full of food and they are chafing to be on to more freedom . " " Round them out , then , when they have had their morning meal , " shouted Wang the Tiger , " and let us be on our way and half way to our own lands by tomorrow . " Now during these days that Wang the Tiger had been in the house of Wang the Second he had been thinking much of what lands he should take for his own rule and he had talked with his brother who was cautious and wise , and it seemed to them that the lands just over into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purposeand the best to be had . These regions were far enough from Wang the Tiger 's ' home so that if dire need came he would not be taking from those who were his own people and yet near enough so that if he were vanquished in a war he could take refuge among his own . Moreover , it was near enough so that the silver he would need until he was established could be brought to him easily and without too great risk of robbers . As for the lands themselves , they were famous good lands where the famine did not strike too often , and some of the lands were high and some were low , and there were mountains to serve for retreat and hiding . There was besides all this a certain highway that was a passage between the north and south for travellers coming to and fro , and such travellers could very well be taxed for revenues and the right to pass that way . There were two or three large towns too , and a small city , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who tilled the earth . These lands had another value also , and it was that they sent out the best grain to the markets for wine and the people were not very poor . There was but one hindrance to all these goods , and it was that there was already a lord of war over that region and Wang the Tiger must first drive him out if he was to prosper to the utmost , for there is nopI03region rich enough to maintain two lords of war . Now what this lord was or who he was or how strong he was were things Wang the Tiger did not know , for he could not find out anything sure from his brothers except that they had heard him called the Leopard , because he had such a strange slanting forehead sloping back into his head as leopards ' foreheads do , and he ruled the people harshly , so that they hated him . Therefore Wang the Tiger knew he must go secretly to those lands and not in any bold array . No , he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would not look more dangerous than bands of deserting soldiers , and he would seek out some retreat in a mountain and from that vantage he would search out the country with his trusty men and see what sort of a lord of war he had to fight and from whom he must take the lands he felt were already his by destiny . As he planned , so he did . When his men were gathered out of the hamlets and when he had seen each man fed and warmed with good wine against the chill winds that contended with the heat of the mounting sun , when he had taken care that all was paid for and he had asked the villagers , " Did my men do anything in your houses they should not ? " and had heard them answer volubly , " No , they did not , we wish all soldiers were like yours , " then Wang the Tiger was well pleased and he drew his men far out beyond the villages and he told them as they stood about him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " There are the best lands anywhere and there is only one lord to fight against . There is such heady wine , too , in that land , as you have never tasted before ! " When the men heard this they shouted with joy and they clamored , " Take us there , our captainwe have longed for such lands ! " Then Wang the Tiger answered them , smiling his grim smile , " It is not so easy as this , for we must search out the strength of the lord who holds it . If his men are too many for us , we must seek ways of winning them away from him , and every man of you must be a spy to see and to hear . Nor must anyone know why we are come or we are undone . I will go myself first to see where we can make our camp , and my trusty harelipped man shall stay at the border at a hamlet there called the Valley of Peace . He will stay at an inn there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last inn on the street and there is a wine flag hanging out of the door . He is to wait for you and give you the name of the place I shall set for us to gather . Now you are to break up into threes and fives and sevens and saunter as though you were runaways , and if any man asks you where you go , ask him where the Leopard is for you come to join him . To everyone I will give threepI04 pieces of silver for food until we meet . But there is one thing I say to every man . If it comes to my ears that any man has injured a humble man or looked at a woman not free to him I shall not ask what man it is but I will kill two men for every such man I hear about . " Then one man called out , " But , my captain , are we never to be free to do the things soldiers may ? " And Wang the Tiger shouted at him , " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fought for me yet , and shall you have the rewards of battle when there has been no battle ? " The man was silent then and he was afraid , for Wang the Tiger was known to be very sudden in his tempers and swift with his sword and he was not a man whom one could move with a witty word or a merry saying fitly spoken . Yet he was known to be just , too , and these men who followed him were good enough and they knew what . was fair . It was true they had not fought yet and they were willing to wait so long as they were fed and sheltered and paid . Then Wang the Tiger watched them as they scattered into groups and when they were so scattered , he paid them from the store he had , and with the pocked lad on his ass and the harelipped trusty man upon a mule Wang the Tiger had bought for him at a hamlet , the three started alone toward the northwest . When Wang the Tiger came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he forced his red horse up a large , tall grave of some rich man 's that stood there , and from this vantage he looked out over the land . It was the fairest land he had ever seen and it spread itself out before him , rolling in little low hills and in wide shallow valleys that were already faintly green with the newly sprouted winter wheat . To the northwest the hills rose suddenly into jagged mountains full of cliffs cut clearly against the bright sky of the day . The houses of the people of that land were scattered in small villages and hamlets , good earthen houses not fallen into decay , and many had the roofs newly thatched with straw from that year 's harvest . There were even a few houses of brick and tile . In every dooryard near enough for him to see there were ricks of straw and he could hear the distant cackling of hens that had laid their eggs , and now and again the wind blew to him where he stood fragments of some song a farmer sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair land and his heart leaped to see how fair it was . But he had no mind to go through clad as he was in a soldier 's garb and on his red horse and let a rumor of war loose too early upon the people . No , he looked and he planned out for himself a winding way to the mountains where he could hide himself and his men and seek out the strength of his enemy before any could even know he was come. pI05At the foot of the low hill upon which this tall grave and many other graves were , was a little village , the border village of which he had told his men . It stretched out its few furlongs of one street , and Wang the Tiger turned his horse there and he rode through it , with the pair behind him . It was at that time of the morning when farmers return to their own hamlets , and the village tea house was full of farmers drinking tea or supping up bowls of noodles made from wheaten flour or buckwheat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground beside them as they ate , and they looked up in wonder when they heard the clattering of hoofs upon the street and they stared with jaws ajar as Wang the Tiger passed . He looked back at them , too , to see what sort of men they were , and he was very pleased to see how goodly they were , how brawny and brown and hearty and how well fed and he said to himself freshly he had chosen his lands very well if it could breed such men as these . But , save that he looked at them , he went with unusual modesty and as one goes who passes through a place a guest and going on to some other far place . At the end of the street there was the wine shop he had heard of and he told the pair to wait outside , and he halted his horse and dismounted and he pushed aside the curtain at the door and went into the shop . There was no one there for it was a very small place with but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger sat down and slapped the table with his hand . A lad came running out then and seeing how fierce a man was there he ran back to his father , who was the keeper of the shop , and the man came out and wiped the table with his torn apron and he said , courteously , " My lord guest , what will you have for wine ? " " What have you ? " returned Wang the Tiger . The shop keeper answered him , " We have the fresh sorghum wine made in these parts . It is the best wine and shipped over the whole earth , I suppose , even to the emperor in the capital . " At this Wang the Tiger laughed in some scorn and he said , " Have you not heard in this little village that we have no emperor these days ? " At this a great look of terror came over the man 's face and he said in a whisper , " No , and I had not heard it ! When did he die ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , who is our new emperor ? " And Wang the Tiger marvelled that there could be a man so ignorantas this and he replied with some slight scorn , " We have no new emperor these days at all . " " Then who rules us ? " said the man in consternation as at some new disaster newly fallen on him unawares. pIo6 " It is a time of striving , " said Wang the Tiger . " There are many rulers and it is not known which can seize the highest seat . It is such a time as any man may use to rise to glory . " This he said , and the ambition that was the greatest part of him soared up suddenly and he cried to his own heart , " And why may not that one be I ? " But he said nothing aloud ; he only sat and waited for his wine beside the small unpainted table . Then the man when he had fetched the jug of wine came back and it could be seen from his sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang the Tiger , " It is a very evil thing to have no emperor , for this is to have a body without a head and this means wild movements everywhere and none to guide us all . It is an ill thing you have told me , my lord guest , and I wish you had not told me for now I shall not be able to forget it . Humble as I am , I shall not be able to forget it , and however peaceful our village is I shall be afraid every day for the next . " And with downcast looks the man poured the warm wine into a bowl . But Wang the Tiger did not answer for he had his thoughts elsewhere than on this humble soul , and as for him he was glad it was such an hour as it was . He poured out the wine and drank it down quickly . It spread through his blood , hot and strong , and he felt it mount to his cheeks and fume through his head . He did not drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for it and for a bowl more and this he took out to his trusty harelipped man . The man was very grateful for it , too , and he took the bowl in both his hands and supped as best he could , lapping it somewhat as a dog does to ' taste it and then throwing his head back and pouring it down his throat because his upper lip was so little use to him , divided as it was . Then Wang the Tiger went back into the shop and he said to the keeper , " And who rules you here in this region ? " The man looked east and west at this but there was no one near and so he said in a low voice , " It is a robber chief who is called the Leopard . He is the cruellest bitter fellow . Every one of us must pay a tax to him or he comes sweeping down on us with all his ne'er-do-wells , he and his men like a flock of evil crows to pick us clean . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " But is there no one to contend with him ? " asked Wang the Tiger , and he sat down as though it were a small careless thing he said and of no importance to him . And to seem more careless he said , " Bring me a pot of mild green tea . The wine stays like fire in my throat . " And as the man fetched the tea he answered Wang the Tiger , " Not one to contend , my lord guest . We would complain of him to thosePI07above if it were of use so to do . Once we did go to our county court and the highest magistrate in our region lives there . We told him our case and we asked him to send his soldiers out and to borrow soldiers from the one yet above him and see if together they could not drive out this fellow who oppresses us . But , sir , when those soldiers came they were such cruel men and they so lived in our houses and took our daughters and so ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that they grew to be a burden we could not bear . No , and besides this they were such cowards that they ran at the very smell of a battle and the robbers grew all the more arrogant . So we went then and begged the magistrate to take his soldiers off from us again and he did at last . But it was a very bitter thing at best , for many of the soldiers went and took service under the robbers , giving as excuse that they had not been paid for long and they must eat , and we were worse off than beforefor a soldier has a gun to take with him where he goes . And as if it were not enough , that magistrate of ours who lives in the county seat there sent out his tax gatherers and put a heavy tax upon us all , on men on the lands and on keepers of shops , too , because he said the state had been put to such a cost to protect us that we must pay them for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , and so since that time we have never asked for any help , choosing rather to pay so much and so much to the Leopard every feast day and so keep him in bounds . It is well enough while we have no famine and we have had so many good years now that heaven will surely send us a bad year soon , and there must be many bad years in store for us . Then I do not know how we shall do . " To all of this long tale Wang the Tiger listened carefully as he drank his tea . Then he asked again , " Where does this Leopard live ? " Then the wine shop keeper took Wang the Tiger by the sleeve and he led him to a small window at the east of the shop and he pointed with his crooked forefinger , stained with wines , and he said , " There is a mountain yonder with two crests and it is called the Double Dragon Mountain . Between the two crests is a valley and in that valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Wang the Tiger waited to hear and so he affected the more negligence of it and he said carelessly , smoothing his hard mouth with his hand , " Well , I shall stay away from that mountain then . And now I must be on the way to my home northward . Here is the silver I owe you . As for the wine , it is as you say it is , a very good bright heady wine . " Then Wang the Tiger went out and he mounted his horse again and with the two behind him he rode round about so as not to pass any more villages . He rode over the tops of circling hills and through lonelypI08 places although he was never far from men either , because that place was so well tilled and so full of hamlets and villages . But he kept his eyes fixed on that double-crested mountain and he guided his horse to the south of it to a certain other lower mountain he saw that was partly wooded with pine trees . All through that day they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tiger if he did not speak first , unless there were some very pressing thing to be said . Once the lad began to sing a little under his breath , because he was such an one as found silence wearisome , but Wang the Tiger hushed him sternly , for he was in no mood for any merry noise . At the end of the afternoon but before the sun was set they came to the foot of that wooded mountain toward which they had been many hours riding , and Wang the Tiger dismounted from his weary horse and began to climb some rude stone steps that led upward . These he followed and the pair behind him also , their beasts stumbling over the stones , and as they went the mountain grew wilder and there were cliffs over which the road led and streams burst forth here and there between the rocks and the trees , and the grasses grew thick and deep . The mosses upon the stones also were soft and showed but little sign of the passage of human feet except in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever passed this way . When the sun was set they had reached the end of this mountain road and it ended at a temple built of rough stone and set with its back to the cliff so that indeed this cliff was its innermost wall . The temple was very nearly hidden by trees but it could be seen because its faded red walls gleamed out in the setting sun . It was but a small temple , old and ruinous , and its gates were closed . Wang the Tiger went up to it and for a while he stood with his ear pressed against the closed gate . But he heard nothing and so he beat upon it with the handle of his leathern whip . No one came for a long time and then he beat very furiously and with anger . At last the door opened a little and the face of a shorn and shaven priest looked out , a very old and shriveled face . And Wang the Tiger said , " We seek for shelter here tonight , " and as he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that quiet place . But the priest opened the door a very little more and he answered in a little piping voice , " Are there no inns and tea houses in the villages ? We be but a scant handful of men who have left the world and have but the poorest of food without any meat and we drink only water . " And his old knees shook in his robes when he looked at Wang the Tiger . But Wang the Tiger pushed his way in through the gates and past that old priest and he called to his lad and the trusty man , " Here is the very place for which we seek ! " P109He went in then without any heed at all to the priests . He went into the temple through the main hall where the gods were , and they were like the temple , very aged and their gilt peeling from their clay bodies . But Wang the Tiger did not even look at them . He passed them and went into the inner side houses where the priests lived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the others and cleaned not too many days ago . Here he ungirdled his sword , and the trusty man went hither and thither and found food and drink for him , although it was only a little rice and cabbage . But that night as Wang the Tiger laid himself down upon the bed in the room he had chosen he heard a deep , low wailing come out of the hall where the gods were and he rose and went out to see what it was . There the five old priests of the temple were and the two little acolytes they had who were farmers ' sons left there for some prayer answered . They all knelt and wailed to the Buddha who sat leaning on his fat belly in the center of the hall and as they wailed they prayed the god to save them . A torch burned there and the flame flew this way and that in the night winds and in the light of the flying flame these knelt and prayed aloud . Now Wang the Tiger stood and looked at them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be protected against him and they cried , " Save ussave us from the robber ! " When he heard this Wang the Tiger shouted out heartily and the priests leaped to hear his sudden voice and they stumbled to their feet entangled in their robes with their haste , all except one old priest who was the abbot of that temple and he fell flat on his face , thinking his last hour was come . But Wang the Tiger shouted , " I shall not hurt you , you old baldheads ! Look , I have silver to spare , and why should you be afraid of me ? " And as he spoke he opened his girdle purse and he showed them the silver he carried there and it was true there was more silver in it than they had ever seen and he said on , " Beyond this I have more silver and I want nothing of you except shelter for a little while such as any man may claim in his need from a temple . " The sight of this silver did comfort the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said among themselves , " He is some military captain or other who has killed a man he should not have killed , or who has lost his general 's favor and so he must hide for a little time . We have heard of such . " As for Wang the Tiger he let them think what they would and he smiled his slight and mirthless smile , and he went back to his bed . The next day at dawn Wang the Tiger rose and he went out to the gate of the temple . It was a morning of mists and the clouds filled thePIIO valleys and covered this mountain top from every other and he was alone and hid from the world . Nevertheless , the chill in the air reminded him that winter must soon come and he had much to do beforesnows set in , for his men depended on him for food and shelter and for clothing against the cold . So he went into the temple again and he went into a kitchen where his trusty man and the lad slept . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breath whistled through the man 's split lip . They slept fast enough , although already an acolyte was feeding straw carefully into the mouth of the brick oven and from under the wooden lid of the iron cauldron on the bricks a bubble of steam leaked out . When the acolyte saw Wang the Tiger he shrank back and hid himself . But Wang the Tiger paid no heed to him . He shouted to his trusty man and seized him and shook him , and bade him rise and eat and get gone to the inn , lest some of the men pass that morning . Then did the trusty man stagger up out of his sleep rubbing his two hands over his face and yawning - hideously . But he shuffled into his clothes and he dipped a bowl into the simmering cauldron and supped some of the scalding sorghum gruel the acolyte brewed there . Away he went down the mountain , then , a goodly enough man if one saw only his back and not his face , and Wang the Tiger watched him go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger waited that day for his men to gather to him in this lonely place , he planned what he would do and whom he would choose for his trusty men to be his helpers and take counsel with him . He portioned out certain labor to certain numbers of men also , to these to be spies , and to these to forage for food and to others to gather fuel and to others cooking and the mending and cleaning of weapons , to each man his share in their common life . And he thought that he must remember to keep a hard hand over them all , and to rewardthem only where reward was due and he would order all under his complete command . Life and death should be in his own hand . Beyond this he planned how each day he would spend certain hours training his men in feints and postures of war so that when his times of struggle came they would be ready . He dared not waste his bullets for the guns at practice , seeing he had not many beyond his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . So he waited restless in that still mountain top and before the day was ended there were fifty and more men who had found their way to him again and by the end of the next day nearly fifty more . The few left never came and it seemed they had deserted to some other cause . Wang the Tiger waited two more days but they did not come , and he grieved , not because of the men but because with each he had lost a good gun and a belt of bullets . PIIINow when the old priests saw this horde of Men gathering into their peaceful temple they were beside themselves and they did not know what to do . But Wang the Tiger comforted them and he said over and over , " You shall be paid for everything and you need not fear . " But the old abbot answered in his feeble way , for he was very aged and the flesh upon his bones was dried and shriveled with his age , " It is not only that we fear no return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration . This has been a very quiet place and its very name is The Temple of Holy Peace . We few have lived out of the world these many years in this place . Now here are all your lusty hungry men and peace is gone with their coming . They crowd into the hall where the gods are and they spew their spittle everywhere and they stand anywhere , even before a god himself , and pass their water as they please and they are coarse and wild in all they do . " Then Wang the Tiger said , " It is easier for you to move yourselves and your gods than for me to change such things in my men , for they are soldiers . Move your gods then into the innermost hall and I will tell them that to that one place they shall not go . So may you be at peace . " Thus the old abbot did , then , seeing that there was no other way , and they moved every god on its pedestal , except the gilt Buddha who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would burst into pieces and bring disaster upon them all . The soldiers lived in the hall with him then and the priests covered his face with a piece of cloth so that he might not see and be angered by what sins they could not avoid . Then Wang the Tiger chose out from his men the three he would have as.his trusty men . First he took the harelipped man and after him two others , one nicknamed the Hawk , because he had a very curious hooked nose in the middle of his thin face and a narrow , down-droopingmouth , and one nicknamed the Pig Butcher . The Pig Butcher was a great thick fat red man , and his face was large and flat and his featuressmashed upon it as though a hand had smeared him in the making . But he was a lusty fellow , and it was true enough he had once been a pig butcher , but he had killed a neighbor in a brawl and he would often bemoan it and say , " If I had been eating my rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed him . But he quarreled with me when I had my chopping knife in my hand and the thing seemed to fly out of its own accord . " Nevertheless , the man having died of his bleeding , the Pig Butcher had need to run away to save himself from the court . He had one strange skill . Coarse and thick as he was , he had swift and delicate speed in his hand so that if he took a pair of chopsticks he could pluck the flies out of the air as they flew , one by one he plucked them , and many times his fellows would bid him to do this for them to see and they roared with laughter to see such skill . With this exactness he could prick a man as delicately and spill his blood out neatly and swiftly , too . Now these three men were very canny men , although not one could read or write . But for such a life as theirs they needed no learning in books , nor did they dream such learning could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room when he had chosen them and he said , " I shall look to you as my three trusty men above the others to watch them and to see if any betrays me or fails in what I have commanded . Be sure you shall have a reward on the day when I rise to glory . " Then he sent the Hawk out and the Pig Butcher too , and he kept only the harelipped trusty man and to him he said with great stern-ness , " You I set above those other two and it is your duty to see if they , too , fail me in loyalty . " Then he called the three together again and he said , " As for me , I shall kill anyone whose loyalty is even brought to question . I will kill him so swifty that the next breath he had planned as a thing of course shall be left half taken and hanging in the air . " Then his harelipped man answered peaceably , " You need not fear me , my captain . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then the other two swore eagerly also , and the Hawk said loudest of all , " Shall I forget you took me as a common soldier and raised me up ? " This he said , for he had his own hopes in him , too . Then the three made their obeisances before Wang the Tiger to show their humility and their faithfulness , and when this was over Wang the Tiger chose out certain tricky clever men and he sent them out through the land everywhere to spy out what the news was about his enemy . He commanded , " Make all haste and find out what you can so that we can establish ourselves before the great cold begins . Find out how many men follow the Leopard and if you come upon any of them talk to them and test their loyalty to him and see if they can be bribed away or not . I will bribe everyone I can because your lives are more precious to me than silver , and I shall not waste one life if I can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their soldiers ' garb and they wore their old ragged inner garments and Wang the Tiger gave them money to buy what they might need of common upper clothes . They went down the mountain then and into the villages and the pawnshops and bought the old worn clothes that farmers and common men pawn for a few pence and never redeem again they are so poor . Thus clad the men wandered all through that countryside . They idled at inns and at tablesP113where men gamed to pass the time away and they stayed at wayside shops and everywhere they listened . Then they came back and told everything to Wang the Tiger . Now what these men told was the same that Wang the Tiger had heard in the wine shop and it was that the people of these lands hated and feared this robber chief , the Leopard , because every year he demandedmore of them if he was not to come and lay waste their houses and fields . His excuse was that each year he had a greater horde of men to feed and he beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this he ought to be paid . It was true that his band grew very large and larger every year because every idler in that whole region who did not wish to work and all who had committed some crime fled to the lair in the Double Dragon Mountain and joined the Leopard 's banner . If they were good fellows and brave they were very welcome and if they were weak and cowards they were kept to serve the others . There were even some women who went there , bold women whose husbands were dead and who did not care for fame , good or ill , and some men when they went took their wives with them , and some women were captives and held for the men 's pleasure . And it was true , too , that the Leopard did hold off other robber thiefs from this whole region . But in spite of this the people hated him and they were unwilling to give him anything . Yet whether they wished it or not they gave , for they had no weapons . In olden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives and such simple tools , but now that the robbers had foreign guns , these were of no avail ; nor was any courage or anger of avail against so leaping a death as this . When Wang the Tiger asked his spies how many men followed the Leopard he had strange answers , for some said they had heard five hundred and others said two or three thousand and others said more than ten thousand . He could not find out what the truth was and he only knew that it was more by many than the men he had . This gave him much to ponder upon and he saw that he must use guile and keep his guns until the last sharp battle and he must avoid even this if he could . So he pondered as he sat and listened to what his spies said , and he let them say on freely , knowing that an ignorant man tells most when he does not know it . And the man who loved to be merry , the same one who had named his captain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and boasting , " As for me , I am so fearless I pushed my way in to the largest town which is the seat of this whole county and I listened there and they are afraid there , too . Every year this Leopard makes a demand at the feast days and the merchants must give him a vast heap of silver or he says he will attack the town itself . And I said to the fellow who told me ,   and he was a vendor of pork balls , the very best I ever did eat they have rare pigs here , my captain , and they put garlic into their meats , and I am glad if we stay hereand I said , But why does your magistratenot send his soldiers out to fight and do battle with this robber for the people 's sake ? ' And that maker of pork ballshe was a good fellow too , and he gave a bit of a broken ball more than I paid forand he said , That magistrate of ours sits sunken in his opium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general he keeps for his army has never been to war at all and he does not know how to hold a guna little fuming , fussy fellow he is who cares more how his soup is brewed than what happens to us ! As for that magistrate you should see the guards he keeps about him and he pays them more and more lest they turn against him or be bribed by someone and he spends out money like one pours tea on the ground out of a cold pot . And with all this he is so afraid he shivers and shakes if the Leopard 's name is even mentioned and he moans to be free and yet does not make a stir of his hand and every year he pays out more to the Leopard to keep him off . ' So this vendor told me and when I had eaten the pork and saw he was in no mind to give me more even if I paid for one more , I went on and I talked with a beggar who sat picking the lice out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a wise old man , too , who begged all his life in the streets of that town . He was the cleverest old man and he bit off the head of every louse he pinched and he crunched them . He was well fed , I swear , with all the lice he had ! And he said when we had talked of many things that the magistrate , this year seemed more of a mind to do something because those higher had heard how he let a robber rule in his regions and there were many who craved his place and they are bringing an accusation against him at the higher court that he does not do his duty and if he must come down there are a dozen who will strive for his place , because these regions are so good and full of revenue . And the people grieve over this , too , for they say , Well , we have fed this old wolf and he is not so greedy as he was and if a new one comes in ravenous he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang the Tiger let his men talk as they would and they did as ignorant men will , telling all they heard and guffawing and making merry , for they were full of high hopes and they had faith in their captain , and everyone was fed and pleased with the land and with the hamlets they had passed through . For although the people had to feed these two , the Leopard and the magistrate , still they had enough left to feed themselves well enough , too , for it was such a goodly land and much was left them . And Wang the Tiger let them talk , and if much they said was no worth , still they often let fall something hep115wanted to know and he could sift the wheat from the chaff , for he was much wiser than they . As this fellow ceased his piping , Wang the Tiger laid hold on the last thing he had said , that the magistrate feared lest he lose his place and he thought deeply on this , and it seemed to him that here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak old man he might seize the power over these lands . The more he listened to his men the more sure he grew that the Leopard was not so strong as he had thought , and after a time he made up his mind that he would send a spy to the very strongholds of the robbers ' lair and see what men were there and all the Leopard had for strength . He looked about his men as they sat that night at their evening meal , sitting on their haunches and every man with a roll of hard bread , to gnaw and a bowl of grain gruel to sup , and for a time he could not decide which of them to send and none seemed clever and wise enough . Then his eye fell on his nephew , the lad he kept near him , and he was at this instant gorging himself , his cheeks puffed and full with food . Wang the Tiger did but walk away to his own room and the lad followed him instantly as it was his duty to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stand to hear what he said , and he said , " Are you brave enough for a certain thing I shall tell you ? " And the lad said sturdily , still chewing his great mouthful , " Try me , my uncle , and see ! " And Wang the Tiger said , " I will try you . You are to take a little sling such as lads use to kill birds and you are to go to that doublecrestedmountain and go about evening time and pretend you have lost your way and , are afraid of the wild beasts on the mountain , and you are to go crying at the gates of the lair . When they let you in then say you are a farmer 's son from the valley beyond and you came up the mountain to look for birds and you did not see how swiftly the night came down and you are lost and beg a night 's shelter from this temple . If they will not let you stay then beg them at least for a guide to the pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are and how many guns and what the Leopard is like and tell me everything . Can you be so brave as this ? " Wang the Tiger fixed his two black eyes on the youth and he saw the lad 's ruddy face turn pale so that the pocks stood out like scars on the skin , but he spoke up well enough and he said , although somewhat breathless , " I can do it . " " I have never asked you anything , " said Wang the Tiger sternly , " but perhaps your clownishness can be of some use now . If you are lost and do not use your wits or if you betray yourself it is your own fault . PI16 But you have that merry , silly face and I know you look more simple than you are , and so I have chosen you . But play the part of a simple witless lad and you are safe enough . If you are caughtcan you be brave enough to die and be silent ? " Then the good red came surging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sturdy and strong in his coarse clothes of blue cotton , and he said , " Try me , my captain ! " Then Wang the Tiger was pleased with him and he said , " Brave lad ! It is the test and if you do well you are worthy to move higher . " And he smiled a little as he stared at the boy and his heart that so seldom moved at anything except his gusts of anger now moved a little toward this boy , yet not for the boy 's sake either for he did not love him , but it moved with some vague yearning and he wished again he might have a son of his own ; not like this lad , either , but a strong , true , grave son of his own . So he bade the boy put on such clothes as a farmer 's son wears and girdle a towel about his waist and he had him put on old worn shoes on his bare feet , for he had a long way to go and rough rocks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as all boys have and made out of the small forked branch of a tree aud when it was made he ran lightly down the mountainside and he disappeared into the woods . Then during the two days he was gone Wang the Tiger ordered his men as he planned he would and he apportioned out the work to them all so that none could be idle and mischievous . He sent his trusty men out into the countryside to buy food and he sent them separately and they bought meat and grains in small quantities so that none might suspect they bought for a hundred men . When the evening of the second day was come Wang the Tiger went out and he looked down the rocky steps to see if the lad was come . Deep in his heart he feared for the lad and when he thought of him perhaps cruelly dead he found some strange . compassion and remorse in his heart and as night came on and the new moon rose he looked toward the Double Dragon Mountain and he thought to himself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , and not my own brother 's son . If he is cruelly dead , how shall I meet my brother ? Yet I could only trust my own blood , too . " He watched on after his men slept and the moon came clear of the mountains and swung high in the heavens , but still the lad did not come . At last the night wind grew very chill and Wang the Tiger went in and his heart was heavy because he found what he had not known before , that he would miss the lad a little if he never came back , because he had such merry tricky ways and he could not be angered . PII7But in the small late hours of the night as he lay awake he heard a little beating on the gate and he rose himself and in haste and he went out . There the lad was when Wang the Tiger had drawn away the wooden bar , and he looked very weary and spent but still good humored . He came limping in and his trousers were torn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried . But he was still in high humor . " I am back , Uncle , " he cried in a spent small voice , and Wang the Tiger laughed suddenly and silently in the way he had if he were truly pleased and he said roughly , " What have you done to your thigh ? " But the lad answered lightly , " It is nothing . " Then Wang the Tiger made one of the few jokes he ever made in his life , because he was so pleased , and he said , " I hope the Leopard did not claw it ! " The lad laughed aloud at this for he knew his uncle meant it for laughter , and he sat down on the step into the temple and he said , " No , he did not . I fell upon a briary tree , for the moss is damp with dew and slippery , and the tree scratched me like this . I am starving , Uncle ! " " Come and eat then , " said Wang the Tiger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And he told the lad to come into the hall and sit down and he roared out for a soldier to bring food and drink for the once to serve this lad . But the noise of it woke this man and that and one after the other waked and they came crowding into the court lit by the light of the high moon and they all wanted to hear what the lad had seen . Then Wang the Tiger , seeing how after the lad had eaten and drunk , that he was so important and excited with the success of his venture that he was far from sleep , and seeing that dawn was now near , he said , " Tell it all now , then , and afterwards go to your sleep . " So the boy sat on the altar before the Buddha whose face was covered and he said , " Well , and I went and I went , and that mountain is twice as high as this one , Uncle , and the lair is in a valley round as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it for ours when we take the region . They have houses and everything there like a little village . And I did what you said , Uncle . I went crying and limping to the gates at night with my dead birds in my bosom , and some of the birds on that mountain are the strangest , brightest hue . One I struck was bright yellow all over like gold and I have it yet , it was so pretty " and as he spoke he drew out of his bosom a yellow bird and it hung in his hand soft and dead and like a handful of limp gold there . Wang the Tiger was in all haste to hear the lad 's tale and he chafed at this childishness of a dead bird ,  | but he restrained himself and let the lad tell his tale in his own way , and so the lad went on and he laid his bird carefully on the altar beside him and he looked from one face to another of the men who listened to him , and beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lit and thrust into the ashes of the incense urn on that altar , and the lad said , " Well , and when they heard the beating on the gate they came from within and first they opened a very narrow crack and peered to see who it was . And I cried piteously and said , I am far from my homeI have wandered too far and the night has come down on me and I am afraid of the beasts of the wood and let me come into this temple ! ' Then the one who opened shut the gate again and he ran and asked someone and I cried on and moaned as piteously as I could , " and here the lad moaned to show them all what he did and all the men roared with laughter and admired him and here and there one called out , " The little monkeythe little pocked devil ! " The lad grinned all over his pocked face with delight and he told on and he said , " They let me in at last and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten wheaten bread and a bowl of gruel I pretended to be frightened and to know where I was and I began to cry , I want to go to my home . I am afraid here because you are the robbers and I am afraid of the Leopard ! ' and I ran to the gate and wanted to be let out and I said , I would liefer be among wild beasts after all ! ' " Then they all laughed because I was so simple and they comforted me and said , Do you think we will hurt a lad ? Wait until morning and you may go your way in peace . ' So I ceased my shivering and cryingafter a while and I pretended to be more at ease and they asked me where I had come from and I told them the name of a village I had heard was on the other side of the mountain . Then they asked me what I had heard about them and I said I had heard they were very heroic , fearless men and their leader not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head on it , and I said , I would like to see him , but I would be afraid , too , to see such a sight . ' They all laughed at me , then , and one said , Come and I will show you him , ' and he led me to a window and I looked in out of the darkness and there were torches burning inside , and there the chief sat . He is truly a curious and monstrous fellow , Uncle , and his head is wide at the top and slopes at the brow so that he does look like a leopard , and he sat drinking with a young woman . She was very fierce , too , and still she was pretty , but fierce , and they drank together from a jug of wine . First he drank and then she drank . " " How many men were there in that place and what their guns ? " asked Wang the Tiger. pI19 " Oh , many men , Uncle , " said the lad earnestly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving men and there are women and there are little children running everywhere and some lads like me . I asked one of them who his father was and he said he did not know because they had no separate fathers there and they only knew their mothers but not their fathers . And that is a strange thing , too . All the fighting men have guns but the serving men have only sickles and knives and such homely things . But at the head of the cliffs about the lair they have great heaps of round rocks piled to roll down upon any who attack them , and there is only one pass into that lair , for there are cliffs everywhere about it and guards always at the pass .. Only the guard slept when I came by and I crept past him . He slept so that I might have taken his gun for it lay there on the rock beside him and he snored so that I might have taken it . But I did not , though I was tempted , for they might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did the fighting men seem large and brave ? " asked Wang the Tiger again . " Brave enough , " replied the lad . " Some are big and some small , but they talked among themselves after they had eaten and they paid no heed to me for I stayed with the lads after a while , and I heard them complain against the Leopard because he would not divide the spoils according to their law , and he kept so much for himself and he was greedy with all the pretty women and he would not let the other men have them until he was tired of them . He did not share as brothers should share , they said , and he held himself too high , although he was born a common fellow , and he can not read and write , and they are weary of his highness . " Now this pleased Wang the Tiger greatly when he heard it and he mused on as the lad told his story of this and that and what he had to eat and how clever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a while he saw that the lad had told all and only repeated his words and searched his brain for a last thing so that he might keep the attention and the admiration of the men as long as he could . Then Wang the Tiger rose and he commended the lad and bade him go to sleep now and he told the men to be at their tasks for it was dawn , and the torch was burned down and its flickering flame pale in the light of the rising sun . He went into his room , then , and he called his trusty men to him and he said , " I have mused and planned and I believe I can do this thing without losing a life or a gun , and we must avoid battle , since they are so many more than we are in that lair . The thing to do when one kills a centipedeis to crush its head and then its hundred legs are in confusion and they run hither and thither against each other and they are harmless . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The men stared astounded at such boldness and the Pig Butcher said in his loud coarse way , " Captain , it sounds well , but you must first catch the centipede before you can cut off his head ! " " So shall I , " returned Wang the Tiger , " and here is my plan . You are to help me . We are to garb ourselves very fine and bravely as heroes do , and we will go to the magistrate of this region and say we are braves and wandering soldiers and that we seek for service under him , secret service as a private guard , and we will give as our pledge that we will kill the Leopard for him . He is anxious now for his seat and he will be eager for our help . Here is the plan . I will tell him he is to pretend truce with the robber and invite the Leopard and the next to him to a mighty feast . Then when the moment comes , and he can mark it by a wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will rush from where we are hidden and fall upon the robbers and kill them . I will have our men scattered through the town secretly everywhereand they shall fall upon such of the smaller robbers as will not come to my banner . So we will kill this centipede 's head and it is not a thing hard to do . " Now all of them saw this thing was feasible and they were- struck with admiration and they agreed heartily to it . After they had talked a little more of how it would be managed , Wang the Tiger dismissed them and he called his men into the temple hall . He sent his trusty men to see that the priests were not near where they could hear him and then he told his gathered men what his plan was . When they heard it they shouted loudly , " Good ! Good ! Ha , the Black-browed Tiger ! " And Wang the Tiger heard them as he stood there beneath the veiled god and although he said nothing and he was very proud and silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep pleasure in his power that he lowered his eyes and stood there grave among his men . When they were still once more and waited to hear what else he might tell them , he said , " You are to eat and drink well , and then garb yourselves as commonlyas you can , but still as soldiers , and take your guns and scatter yourselves through the city only not too far from the magistrate 's court . When I send out my shrill whistle you are to come . But wait the numberof days until I call . " And he turned to his trusty harelipped man and he said , " Pay every man five pieces of silver for wine and lodging and the food he needs . " This was done and every man was content . Then Wang the Tiger called his three trusty men to him and they dressed themselves bravelypI2Iand concealed short swords in their garments and they took up their guns and they all went away together . As for the priests , they rejoiced very much to see these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them rejoicing he said , " Do not rejoice too soon , for we may come back . But if we can find a better place we will not . " He paid them well , nevertheless , and above what he owed he gave them a sum and he said to the abbot , " Mend your roofs and repair your house and buy yourselves each a new robe . " The priests were overjoyed at such generosity and the old abbot was somewhat ashamed and he said , " You are a good man after all , and I shall pray before the gods for you and how else can I reward you ? " To this Wang the Tiger answered , " No , do not trouble yourself with gods , for I have never had faith in them very much . But if in after days you hear of one called the Tiger , then speak well of him and say the Tiger treated you well . " The old abbot stared and stammered in a daze and he said he would , he would ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two hands . STRAIGHT to the city did Wang the Tiger lead his trusty men andwhen they were come to it then straight to the gates of the magistrate'scourt they went . When Wang the Tiger was come to the gate he said boldly to the guards that leaned idly against the stone lions there , " Let me in , for I have something private to say to the magistrate . " Now the guard at the gate demurred , for Wang the Tiger did not show any silver at all , and when Wang the Tiger saw the man 's unwillingnesshe shouted once and his trusty men leaped forward and pointed their guns at the man 's breast . He turned green-skinned and fell back and so they passed through , making their shoes clatter upon the stones of the court . There were those idling about the gates who had seen what happened and not one dared to move against them . Then Wang the Tiger cried roughly and fiercely and he drew his black brows down over his eyes , " Where is the magistrate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger saw he grew suddenlyangry and he took his gun and pricked the man nearest him in the belly , and the man leaped in terror and cried out , " I will take you to him I will take you to him ! " And he ran patteringahead , and Wang the Tiger laughed silently to see his terror . PI22So they followed him and they passed through court after court . But Wang the Tiger did not look east or west . He kept his face straight and furious and his trusty men did the . same thing as much as they could . At last they came to an innermost court , very beautiful and set out with a pool and a terrace of peonies and some old pine trees . But the lattices of the rooms upon it were drawn down and there was silence everywhere . The man who led them halted on the threshold and coughed and a servant came then to the lattice and he said , " What do you wish ? Our lord sleeps . " But Wang the Tiger shouted out loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that quiet court , " Wake him , then , for I have something of greatest importance to tell him . He must wake , for it concerns his very seat ! " The servant stared at them uncertainly , but he saw how full of authority was Wang the Tiger 's look , and he surmised these men must be messengers from some higher court . He went in then and shook the sleeping old magistrate and the old man woke out of his dream and he rose and washed himself and put on his robes and he went and sat down in his hall and he told the servant to bring them in . Then Wang the Tiger went in boldly and loudly and he made a proper obeisance before the old magistrate , but still he did not bow too deeply nor full of reverence . - The old magistrate was full of terror at the fierceness of these men before him and he rose in haste and invited them to be seated and he had cakes and wine and fruits brought . And he spoke the usual courteouswords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger returned the scantest courtesy that he could . At last when these rites were over he said plainly , " We have heard from those above that you , most honorable , are oppressed by robber bands and we are come to offer our good arms and our skill to help you be rid of them . " Now all this time the old magistrate had been wondering and tremblingand when he heard this he said in his cracked and quavering voice , " It is true I am so plagued , and I am not a man of arms myself , but a scholar , and I do not know how to deal with such men . It is true I have a general I hire , but he is paid by the state so much whatever he does , and he does not like a battle , either , and the people of this region are so wilful and foolish that in a battle we do not know whether or not they would take the side of the robbers against the state even , they are so easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and what your honored surnames , and where the place where your ancestors resided ? " P123But Wang the Tiger said no more than this , " We are wandering braves , and we offer our arms where they are needed . We have heard this land is ridden by a pest of robbers and we have a plan , if you will hire us . " Now whether or not the old magistrate would in common times have listened to strangers like this none can tell , but it was true that at this time he was very fearful lest his living be taken from him and he had Do son and he could not at his age hope for another living . He had an old wife and a hundred lesser relatives of one sort and another all dependent on him and his place , and in his helpless age his enemies grew Krung and greedy , and so he grasped at anything that might deliver him out of his troubles . He lent his ear now , having sent away his servants , except a few for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he had heard it he seized eagerly upon it . There was only one t h i ng he feared and it was that if they failed and did not kill the Leopard , the robbers would take very bitter revenge . But when Wang the Tiger saw what the old man feared he said carelessly , " I can kill a leopard as easily as a cat , and I can cut off his head and let the blood drip , and my hand will not falter . I swear it ! " And the old magistrate mused and thought how old he was and how his own soldiers were weak and cowardly and it seemed to him there was no other chance for him but this . And he said , " I see no other way . " Then he called his servants back and he bade them bring meats and wines and prepare a feast and he treated Wang the Tiger and his trusty men as honored guests . Wang the Tiger waited then and he planned with the old magistrate and they laid every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they planned they did in the next few days . The old magistrate sent emissaries to the robbers ' lair and he told them to say he was growing old and he was leaving his post and anotherwould come to take his place . But before he left he wished to make sure that no enmity stayed after him and he wished the Leopard and his chiefs would come and dine and feast with them and he would recommend them to the new magistrate . When the robbers heard this they were wary , but Wang the Tiger had thought of this , also , and he told the magistrate to spread rumors everywhere that he was going away . The robbers asked among the common people , therefore , and they heard the same story . So they believed it , then , and they felt it would be a good thing if the new magistrate could be influenced in their favor and fear them and pay the sums they demanded and it would spare them battle . They accepted the truce the old magistrate held out to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night when the moon was dark . Now it happened that on that day rains fell and the night was dark and full of mists and winds , but the robbers held to their word and they came in their best robes and with their weapons sharp and clean and bright , and every man held his sword drawn and glittering in his hand . The courts were filled with the guard they brought and some stood out in the streets about the gates to guard against treachery . But the old magistrate did his part very well , and if his withered old knees shook in his robes , still he kept his face peaceful and his voice courteous , and he caused all weapons among his own men to be put aside , and when the robbers saw no weapons except their own they were more at ease . The old magistrate had caused the best sort of feast . to be prepared by his own cooks and this feast was to be spread forth for the chiefs in the innermost hall but the robber guards were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old magistrate led the chiefs to the hall of feasting , and he assigned the seat of honor to the Leopard , and after many refusals and bows of courtesy the Leopard took it , and the old magistrate sat in the host 's seat . But he had taken care before to have it near a door , for he planned when the moment came for him to throw down his wine bowl as a signal that he would escape and hide until all was over . So the feast began , and at first the Leopard drank cautiously and glowered if any of his chiefs drank too easily . But the wine was very good , the best good wine of all that region , and the meats that were brought in were cunningly seasoned to make men thirsty , and they were such meats as the robbers had never tasted who knew only their rough coarse fare . Such hot and delicate dishes they had not dreamed of for they were from birth but coarse fellows and unused to any dainties . At last their reserve gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so their guards did also in the courts , and the more easily they , since they were not even so wise as their chiefs . Now Wang the Tiger and his trusty men watched from a curtain round a latticed window near the door through which they were to charge . Every man held his sword drawn and ready and they listened for the crash of the porcelain wine bowl which was to be their sign . There came a moment when the feast had lasted three hours or more , and it was a moment when the wine flowed at its freest , and the servantsbustled here and there and the robbers were full of meat and wine and heavy with all they had in their bellies . Suddenly the old magistrate began to tremble and his face turned ashy and he faltered out , " The strangest pain has struck my heart ! " He lifted his wine bowl in all haste but his hand shook so that the delicate thing seemed to shiver out of his hand and fell upon the tiles and he staggered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breath in surprise , Wang the Tiger blew his whistle and he shouted once to his men and they charged through the door upon the robber chiefs and each trusty man sprang upon the one whom Wang the Tiger had already appointed to him . But the Leopard Wang the Tiger kept for himself to kill . Now the servants had been told that when they heard the shout they were to bar every door , and when the Leopard saw this he leaped to his feet and dashed to the door through which the old magistrate had staggered . But Wang the Tiger sprang upon him and pinned his arms , and the Leopard had but a short sword he had plucked as he leaped , and not his own sword , and he was helpless . Each man thus fell upon his enemy and the room was full of cries and curses and struggling men and no trusty man looked to see what any other did , until he had killed the one appointed to him . But some robbers were easily killed because they were fumbling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to Wang the Tiger to see how he did and to help him . Now the Leopard was no mean enemy and although he was half drunken he was so swift with his flying feet and he could kick and fence so well that Wang the Tiger could not end him with a single Sword thrust . But he would not have help for he wanted this glory and be struggled with the Leopard . And indeed when he saw how bravelyis man fought and how desperately with only the poor weapon he snatched , Wang the Tiger was moved to admiration , as a brave is even against a foe if he be brave also , and he was sorry he must kill the man . But still he must , and so he drove the Leopard into a corperwith his flying sword , and the man was too full fed and too drunken to do his best . Moreover , it was hopeless for the Leopard who had taught himself all he knew , and Wang the Tiger had been taught in an and he knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The moment came then when the Leopard could not defendself quickly enough and Wang the Tiger drove his sword into theman 's vitals and twisted it strongly once and blood and water rushed . But as the Leopard sank and died he gave Wang the Tiger such athat Wang the Tiger never did forget it his whole life long it waswild and fierce . And the man did indeed look like a leopard , for hiswere not black as are the eyes of common mortals , but they wereand yellow as amber . When Wang the Tiger saw him still at lastlying dead and his yellow eyes staring he said to himself that this a true Leopard , for besides his eyes , his head was wide . at the topsloped back in the strangest , beast-like way . The trusty menBred then to praise their captain , but Wang the Tiger held his sword , forgetful of it , and he stared down at the dead man still , he said sorrowfully , PI26 " I wish I need not have killed him , for he was a fierce , brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . " But even as he stood and looked sadly at what he had had to do , the Pig Butcher shouted out that the Leopard 's heart was not yet cold , and before any knew what he was about he had stretched out his hand and taken a bowl from the table and with the swift delicate skill that was lodged so curiously in his coarse hand he cut a stroke into the Leopard 's left breast and he pinched the ribs together and the Leopard 's heart leaped out of the cleft and the Pig Butcher caught it in the bowl . It was true the heart was not cold and it quivered a time or two there in the bowl and the Pig Butcher stretched out the bowl in his hand to Wang the Tiger and . he called out in a loud , merry way , " Take it and eat it , my captain , for from old times it has been said the heart of a brave foe eaten warm makes one 's own heart twice as brave ! " But Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . said , haughtily , " I do not need it . " And his eye fell on the floor near the chair where the Leopard had sat to feast and he saw the Leopard 's sword glittering there . He went and picked it up . It was a fine steel sword such as cannotbe made this day , so keen that it could cut through a bolt of silk and so cold it could divide a cloud in two . Wang the Tiger tried it upon the robe of a robber who lay dead there and it melted through to the man 's bone even before he pressed it at all . And Wang the Tiger said , " This sword alone will I take for my share . I have never seen a sword like this . " Just then he heard a gagging noise and it was his pocked lad who had stood staring at the Pig Butcher , and he ' was suddenly sick and vomited at what he saw . And Wang the Tiger hearing it said kindly , for he knew it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have done well not to be sick before this . Go out into the cool court . " But the lad would not , and he stood his ground sturdily and Wang the Tiger was pleased at this and he said , " If I am Tiger , you are fit to be a Tiger 's cub , I swear ! " And the lad was so pleased he grinned , and his teeth shone out of his white sick face . When Wang the Tiger had thus done what he promised he would he went out into the courts to see what his men had done with the lesser robbers . It was a cloudy dark night , and the shapes of his men were but a little more solid and dark than the night . They waited and he commanded that torches be lit , and when they were flaring he saw thatp127only a few men lay dead and he was pleased , for he had commanded that men were not to be wantonly killed and that they were to have the chance to choose if they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Wang the Tiger 's work was not done yet . He was determined to storm the lair now that it was weakest and before the robbers who were left had any time to reinforce themselves . He did not stay even to we the old magistrate , but he sent word saying , " I will not claim a rewarduntil I have stamped out this nest of snakes . " And he called to his men and they went through the dark night across the fields to the I ) ouble Dragon Mountain . Now Wang the Tiger 's men did not follow him very willingly for they had fought already this night and the march was a good three miles or so and they must perhaps fight again and many of them had hoped to be allowed to loot in the city as a reward for their battle . They complained to him then saying , " We fought for you and we risked our lives and you have not let us take any booty either . We have never served under so hard a master for we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booty ; no , and not so much as touch a maid , either , and we have held ourwivesoff until we fought for you , and still you give us no freedom . " At first Wang the Tiger would not answer this but he could not bear it when he ' heard several of them muttering together and he knew he must be cruel and hard or they would betray him . So he turned on them and slashed his fine sword whistling through the air and he roared at them , " I have killed the Leopard and I will kill any and all of you and care nothing . Do you have no wisdom at all ? Can we despoil the very place which we hope to be ours and turn the people against us with hatred the very first night ? No more of these cursed words ! When we come to the lair you may loot anything and take it all , except that you are not to force a woman against her will . " Then his men were cowed and one said timidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And another said , half wondering , " But , captain , it was not I who complained , and if we do loot the lair where are we to live , for I thought we were to have the lair . " Then Wang the Tiger answered sullenly , for he was still angry , " We are no robber band and I am no common robber chief . I have a better plan if you will but trust me and not be fools . That lair shall be burned to the ground and the curse of those robbers shall pass from this countryside , so that men need fear them no more . " Then his men were more astonished than ever , even his trusty men , and they said , one speaking for all , " But what shall we be , then ? "  | " We shall be men of battle , but not robbers , " answered Wang the Tiger very harshly . " We will have no lair . We shall live in the city and in the magistrate 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need fear no one for we shall be under the name of the state . " Then the men fell silent in very awe of the cleverness of this leader of theirs , and their evil humor passed from them like a wind . They laughed aloud and they trusted to him , and they mounted the steps eagerly that led to the pass to the lair , and about them the fogs wreathed and curled in those mountains , and their torches smoked in the cold mists . They came suddenly to the mouth of the pass and a guard was there so astonished he could not run , and one of the men , being very merry , ran him through with his sword before he could speak . Wang the Tiger saw this but he did not reprove his man for once , because it was but one he killed , and it is true that a captain can not hold ignorant and wild men too closely in check , lest they turn and rend him . So he let the man lie dead and they went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indeed like a village and it had a wall of rock hewn out of the mountain and welded together with clay and lime so that it was very strong and there were great iron-bound gates set into the wall . Wang the Tiger beat upon those gates , but they were locked fast and strong , and no answer came . When he beat again and still no answer came , he knew that those within had heard of what had befallentheir leader , and doubtless some of the robbers had run back and warned the others , and either they had fled from the lair or they had entrenched themselves within the houses and prepared for attack . Then Wang the Tiger bade his men prepare fresh torches out of the dried autumn grass that was about the lair and they set fire to these torches of twisted grass and they burned a hole in the wooden part of one of the gates , and when the hole was big enough one slipped through it and unbarred the gates swiftly . They all went in then , and Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as still as death . Wang the Tiger stood to listen and there was not a sound . Then he gave the command that every man was to blow his torch to flame and the houses were to be set on fire . Every man ran to the task and they yelled and screeched as the thatched roofs of the houses caught fire and as the whole lair began to burn suddenly people began to run out of the houses as ants will run out of a hill . Men , women , and little children streamed out and they ran cowering here and there and Wang the Tiger 's men began to stab them as they ran until Wang the Tiger shouted that they were to be allowed to escape , but that the men might go in and take their goods . So Wang the Tiger 's men rushed into such houses as were not toopI29and they began to drag out booty of silken pieces and yards ofand garments and anything they could carry . Some found gold silver and some found jars of wine and food and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perished in the veryr they themselves had lit . Then Wang the Tiger seeing how Mash they were sent his trusty men to see that they did not come tom and so not many perished. for Wang the Tiger , he stood apart and watched it all , and he his brother 's son near him and he would not let the lad loot any- . He said , , lad , we are not robbers and you are my own blood and we do rob . These are common , ignorant fellows and I must let them haveway once in a time or they will not serve me loyally , and it is er to let them loose here . I must use them for my toolsthey are means to greatness . But you are not like them . " lie kept the lad by him , and it was very well he did , for the strangthinghappened . As Wang the Tiger stood there leaning on his gun watching the flaming houses that were beginning already td smoketo smoulder , the lad suddenly gave a great scream . Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uponInstantly he lifted his sword up and met it and the blade slipped the smooth sword and it fell a little on his hand , but so little it scarcely a wound , and fell to the ground. t Wang the Tiger leaped into the darkness , swifter than a tiger , he laid hold on someone and he dragged it out into the light of the and it was a woman . He stood there confounded , holding her by arm he had caught , and the lad cried out , " It is the woman I saw drinking with the Leopard ! " t before Wang the Tiger could say a word , the woman haded and writhed and turned herself , and when she found he held fast and beyond her strength to free herself , she threw back her d and she spat full into Wang the Tiger 's eyes . Now he had never such a thing happen to him before and it was such a filthy , hatefulng that he lifted his hand and slapped her upon the cheek as one ps a wilful child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers re purple upon her cheek , and he shouted , " ' That for you , you tigress ! " This he said without thinking what he said and she shouted back at viciously , " 1 wish I had killed you , you accursedI meant to kill you ! " And he said grimly holding her fast still , " Well I know you did , and if it had not been for my pocked lad here would have lain dead this instant with my skull cleft ! " And he calledp130to some of his men to bring a rope from somewhere and bind her and they bound her to a tree there by the gate until he could know what to do with her . Now they bound her very tightly and she struggled and chafed and cut her flesh but she could not so much as loosen herself , and as she struggled she cursed them all and especially Wang the Tiger with such curses as are seldom heard anywhere they were so rich and vile . Wang the Tiger stood and watched while the men bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men had gone to their pleasure again , he walked back and forth then in front of her and every time he passed he looked at her . Each time he looked more steadfastly and with more wonder , and he saw she was young and that she had a hard , bright , beautiful face , her lips thin and red and her forehead high and smooth and her eyes bright and sharp and angry . It was a face narrow and bright as a fox 's face . Yes , it was beautiful , even now when she had it twisted with hate for him every time he passed her and each time he passed she cursed him and spat at him . But he paid no heed to her . He only stared at her as he went in his silent way and after a time as the night wore on to dawn she grew weary for they had tied her so tightly that she was in much pain and at last she could not bear it . At first she did not curse and only spat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not spit either and at last she said , panting and licking her lips , " Loosen me even a little , for I am in such pain ! " But Wang the Tiger did not heed this , either , and he only smiled hardly , for he thought it was a trick of hers . She begged him thus every time he came near her but he would not answer . At last one time he came past and her head hung down and she was silent . Still he would not go near her , for he would not be spit on again and he thought she feigned sleep or faintness . But when she did not move for several times he passed , he sent the lad to her , and the lad went and took her by the chin and turned her face up , and it was true she had fainted . Then Wang the Tiger went to her and he looked at her closely , and he saw that she was fairer than he had even seen her to be in the dim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than five and twenty , and she did not look a common farmer 's daughter or a commonwoman and he could not but wonder who she was and how she came to be here and where the Leopard had found such a one . He called a soldier then to come and cut her down and he had her trussed still , but more lightly and not hung against a tree . He bade them lay her on the ground and there she lay and she did not come to herself until it was dawn and the sunlight was beginning to creep . through the morning mists.  |p131Then  at this hour Wang the Tiger called his men and he said , " The time is up . We have other things to do than this . " His men ceased their quarreling over booty slowly and they gathered at his call for he made his voice very loud and fierce and he held his gun cocked and ready for any who would not obey him , and he said , when his men were come , " Collect every gun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I claim these as my share . " When his men had done this , Wang the Tiger counted the guns and there were a hundred and twenty guns and a goodly amount of ammunition , too . But some of the guns were old and rusty and of little value , and these Wang the Tiger , because they were of such ancient and clumsy design , kept to one side to throw away as soon as he could find better . Then in the midst of the ruined and smoking lair his men tied their booty into bundles , some large and some small , and Wang the Tiger counted over the guns they had found and these he gave to the more trustworthy men to guard . At last he turned to the woman who was tied . She had come to herself and she lay on the ground , her eyes open . When Wang the Tiger looked at her she stared back at him angrily and he said to her harshly , " Who are you and where is your home that I may send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one word . She spat at him for answer and her face was like an angry cat 's . This enraged Wang the Tiger greatly , so he called out to two of his men , " Put a pole through her bonds and carry her to the magistrate 's court and throw her into the gaol there . Perhaps she will tell then who she is ! " The men obeyed him and they thrust the pole ruthlessly through the ropes and carried the ends of the pole on their shoulders , and she swung there . As for Wang the Tiger , when all was ready , the sun was clear of the mountain tops and he walked ahead of his men down the pass . From the lair a feeble cloud of smoke still rose , but Wang the Tiger did not turn to look at it once . Thus they marched along the road through the country to the city once more . Many a man passing this strange throng looked cornerwise out of his eyes , and especially at the woman trussed to the pole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes . Every mart wondered , but not one dared to ask of what had happened , lest he be drawn into some desperate brawl or other , and they were afraid and each went about his business and kept his eyes down after he had glanced a time or two . It was full day and the sun was streaming over the fields when at last Wang the Tiger and his men reached the city gates.  | But when he was in the darkness of the passage through the city wall his harelipped trusty man came and led him aside behind a tree that stood there by the gate , and he whispered to Wang the Tiger , hissing with the earnestness of what he had to say , " I have this to say that I must say , my captain . It is better not to have anything to do with this woman . She has a fox 's face and fox eyes and women like this are only half human and the other half fox , and they have a very magic wickedness . Let me put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now Wang the Tiger had very often heard the tales of things that women who are half fox will do , but he was so bold and fearless in himself that he laughed loudly now and he said , " I am afraid of no man and no spirit and this is only a woman ! " And he brushed the man away and went to the head of his throng again . But the harelipped trusty man followed behind him muttering ; and he muttered , " But this is a woman and more evil than a man , and she is a fox and more evil than a woman . " WHEN Wang the Tiger came into the same courts where thenight before he had done such a deed , and his men followed after him with haphazard steps because they were so weary , they found those courts cleaned and all as they had been before . All the dead had been taken away and the blood wiped and washed away with water . Every guard and servant stood in his place , and they were frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he came as arrogant as a king and everyone hastened to make obeisance before him . But he held himself straight and haughty and he strode through the courts and the halls , pride magnificent upon his dark face . Well he knew he held this whole region now in the hollow of his hand . He turned to a guard who stood there and he shouted , " Take this trussed woman and put her somewhere in the court gaol ! Guard her and see that she is fed and not treated ill , for she is my prisoner and when I wish I will decide what her punishment is to be . " He stood and watched then while the men carried her away on the pole . She was exhausted and her face was as white as tallow . Even her lips that had been so red were white now , too , and her eyes were as black as inkstone in her paleness and she gasped for her every breath . But she still could turn those great fierce black eyes to Wang the Tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face in a grimaceP133against him , but her mouth was dry . And Wang the Tiger was astounded , for he had never seen such a woman as this , and he puzzled what he would ever do with her , for she never could be let go free so full of hatred as this , and so strong in her revengefulness . But he put the matter from him for this while and he went in before the old magistrate . Now the old magistrate had been waiting since beforedawn , and he sat there in his full robes and he had ordered foods prepared of the finest kind . When he saw Wang the Tiger come in he was all of a twitter and in great confusion , because though he was grateful for what Wang the Tiger had done , yet he knew such a man would not serve another for nothing , and he dreaded to hear what rewardWang the Tiger would ask , lest it be so great that he was more burdened than he had been by the Leopard . So he waited in dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang the Tiger was come and when he saw Wang the Tiger come in and with . the great measured strides such as a hero uses , the old magistrate was so confused with his fears that he did not know what to do with his hands and feet and without his knowing it they rembled and moved as though they had a life of their own apart from him . But he invited Wang the Tiger to be seated , and Wang the Tiger made the proper courteous replies , and when the rites of courtesy were over and Wang the Tiger had bowed and bowed but not too deeply , either , and the old magistrate had ordered tea and wines and meats to be brought , they sat down at last and they made a little idle talk . But the moment came when the thing that had been done could not be avoided longer , and looking east and west and gazing every which way except at Wang the Tiger , the old magistrate opened his mouth to speak . Nor did Wang the Tiger help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew very well the condition in the old magistrate 's heart and lie did no more than fix his steadfast eyes on the nervous old man , because he knew he frightened him thus , and the knowledge gave pleasure to Wang the Tiger because of the malice in him . At last the old magistrate began in his hurried feeble old voice , very soft and whisperingand low , " Be sure I never can forget what you did last night and I can never thank you enough that I am rid of the pest under which I have suffered all these years and my old age can be peaceful now . And what shall I say to you who have delivered me , and how shall I reward you , who are more to me than a son ? And how reward your noble men ? Ask what you will , even to my very seat , and it is yours . " And he waited trembling and biting his forefinger . Wang the Tiger sat calm and waiting until the old magistrate was done and then he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From my youth I have been against all wicked and evil men , and what I did I did to rid the people from a pest . " Then he sat silent and waited again , and now it was the magistrate 's turn and he said , " You have the heart of a hero and I did not dream there were such as you in these days . But still I can not close my eyes in peace even when I am dead if I do not give you thanks in some certain way , and so speak and say what will please you best . " Thus they talked back and forth and with each speech spoken in turn and very properly and courteously they came nearer to the point at last , and then Wang the Tiger made it known in winding words that he was minded to open the ranks of his men to all of the Leopard 's old followers who wished to change their banner . At this the old magistratewas filled with fright and he grasped the sides of his carved chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But are you minded to be a robber chief in his place then ? " And to himself he said that if this were so then was he undone indeed , for this strange tall black-browed fellow , who had come to him from nowhere , was fiercer to see than even the Leopard had been and he was more clever . At least the Leopard had been known to all , and it was known how much he would demand ; and thinking thus the old magistrate began to groan aloud a little without knowing that he did . But Wang the Tiger spoke out straightly and he said , " You need not fear . I have no mind to be a robber . My father was an honorable man who owned land and I have my own inheritance from him . I am not poor so that I need to rob for anything . Moreover , my two older brothers are rich and proper men . If I carve out my future way to greatness it will be by my own skill at war and by no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my reward and all I ask of you . Let me stay here with my men in your courts and appoint me as your own chief general in your army you have here . I and my men will come as part of your retinue , and I will protect you from robbers and I will protectyour people , also . You can feed us and give us certain revenues that are our due , and you can give me the shelter of the name of the state . " Now the old magistrate listened to this in bewilderment and he said feebly , " But what shall I do with the general I have already ? I shall be torn between you , for he will not go down lightly from his post . " To this Wang the Tiger made brave answer , " Let , us fight it out as honorable men do , and if he wins , I will go away and let him have my men and my guns . If I win , he is to go away and leave me his . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a scholar and a follower of sages , and he loved peace , sent out and called for his gen/eral to come in . And after a while the man came , a little pompous round-bellied man who wore war garments of a foreign sort , and he grew a little sparse beard and he brushed his scanty eyebrows up and did his little best to look fierce and brave . He dragged a long sword at his heels as he came in and he came stamping his feet down hard at each step . When he bowed , he bowed from his waist and he tried to be very ferocious . Then halting and sweating , the old magistrate somehow made known to him what the matter was and Wang the Tiger sat there coldly and he looked away and seemed to think of other things . At last the old magistrate was silent and he hung his , head and he wished himselfdead and he thought to himself that he would soon be dead betweenthese two , for he had always thought his own general fierce enough since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , but Wang the Tiger was far swifter and deeper in his anger , as any man could see who looked at that face of his . Now the little pot-bellied general was angry enough at what he heard and he had laid his little fat hand on his sword and made as though he would dart at Wang the Tiger . But Wang the Tiger saw the movementalmost before it was made , although at the time he had been staringseemingly into the peony terrace in the court , and he drew his wide lips back from his white teeth and pulled down his heavy black brows and folded his arms across his breast and he stared so heavily at the little general and with such a dire look , that the little man faltered and thought better of what he did and swallowed his anger as best he could . And indeed he was not a fool . He saw his day was over , for he ( lid not dare to measure himself against Wang the Tiger . He said at last to the old magistrate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to return to my old father , for I am his only son and he grows very old . But I have never been free to go because my duties here at your honored court have been so arduous and continuous . Besides this filial duty that is mine there is the illness in my belly , which seizes me every now and again . You know of this illness , my lord , and how because of it I have not been able to go as I have so longed to do against those robbers and all these years I have chafed at my inability which Heaven itself put upon me . So now I gladly retire to my old village home to do what I should for my old father and to nurse also my increasing illness . " This he said and he bowed very stiffly and the old magistrate rose and bowed also and he murmured , " Be sure you shall be well rewarded for all your faithful years . " And the magistrate looked after the little general regretfully as he withdrew and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a very easy man of war and if he had not put down the robbers still he was not hard to have in the courts except when his little tempers flew up over some small question of meat and drink and these were easily settled . And then the old magistrate stole a look at Wang the Tiger and he was very ill at ease because Wang the Tiger looked young and harsh and very fierce and ill-tempered . But he only said in his peaceable way , " Now you have the reward you wish . You may have the courts the old general had as soon as he is gone , and you may take the soldiers . But there is one thing more . What shall I say to those above me when it is known I have changed my general , and what even if the old generalgoes to complain of me ? " But Wang the Tiger was clever and he answered at once , " It will all bring glory to you . Tell them you hired a brave and he put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private guard . Then do you force the general and I will put my force behind yoursto write and ask that he be allowed to retire and he must name me in his place , and so shall the glory be yours , that you hired me and through me you routed the robbers . " Then , although unwillingly , the old magistrate saw this was no mean plan and he began to be somewhat cheered except that he was still afraid of Wang the Tiger and he feared his ruthlessness lest it ever be turned against himself . But Wang the Tiger let him be afraid , for this suited him , and he smiled his cold smile . Now did Wang the Tiger settle himself into those courts , for the winter was come down out of the north . He was well pleased with all he had done , for his men were fed and clothed and his revenues began to come in and he could buy them winter garments and they were all warm and fed . When he had arranged everything for them and the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in regular procession , Wang the Tiger bethought himself suddenly one idle day of the woman he had still in the gaol . He smiled to himself harshly when he thought of her and he shouted to the guard at his door , " Go and fetch that woman out of the gaol I sent there some sixty days or so ago ! I had forgot that I have not fixed her punishment and she tried to kill me . " Then he laughed silently and said again , " She is tamed by now , I dare swear ! " So he waited in some pleasure and interest to see how tamed she would be . He sat alone in a hall of his own and beside him was a large iron brazier of coals . Outside the snow of deep winter fell heavily and the court was filled with the snow and it hung thickly on every branch and tree , for there was no wind on that day , only a very bitter , silent cold , frozen with the dampness of the falling snow . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coals , and he was wrapped well in a sheepskin robe , and a tigerskin was thrown across the back of his chair to keep the chill away . It was nearly an hour before he heard . a commotion in the silent court and he looked toward the door . The guard was coming with his prisoner , but he had two other guards to help him . Even so she twisted this way and that and she strained against the ropes that bound her . But the guards forced her into the door and in the struggling the snow swept in with them . When they had her fast at last and standing before Wang the Tiger , the guard said in apology , " General , forgive me because so long a time has passed before I could obey your command . But we have had to force this young hag every step . She lay naked in her bed in the gaol and we could not go in for decency 's sake , for we are respectable men with wives of our own , and so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon her . She bit and scratched and fought against them but at last they had enough on her so that we could go in and tie her and drag her out . She is madit must be she is mad . We have never seen a woman like this . There are those in the gaol who say even that she is not a woman but a fox changed into a woman for some evil purpose of the devils . " But the young woman shook back her streaming hair when she heard this . Her hair had been cut short once , but now it was grown nearly to her shoulders . She screamed forth , " I am not mad unless it be with hate against him ! " and she cursed and she thrust her chin out at Wang the Tiger and she spat at him and would have spat on him except that he drew back hastily and the guards seeing her purpose jerked her back so that her spittle fell hissing upon the hot coals of the brazier . At this the guard stared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mad , my general ! " But Wang the Tiger said nothing . He only fastened his eyes on this strange wild creature , and he listened to her speech , for even when she cursed it was not the speech of a common or ignorant woman . He looked at her closely and he saw that although she was slender and now gaunt to thinness , she was still handsome and haughty , and she did not look like a thick country wench . Yet her feet were big and they looked as though they had never been bound , and this was not as it should be in those parts for a woman who came from a good family . He could make nothing of her , therefore , with all these contradictions , and he only stared on at her and watched her fine black brows twistingabove her angry eyes and her thin pouting lips drawn back from her smooth white teeth , and as he watched it came to him that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen . Yes , even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So at last he said slowly ,   " I have never known you at all . Why should you hate me ? " And the woman answered passionately , and she had a clear , piercing voice , " You killed my lord and I will not rest until I have revenged him . Though you kill me I will hold my dead eyes open until . I am revenged for him ! " At this the guard was horrified and he lifted his sword and he cried , outraged , " To whom do you speak , vixen ? " And he would have smote her across the mouth with the flat of his sword except that Wang the Tiger made a sign that she was not to be touched . Then Wang the Tiger said in his still way , " Was the Leopard your master ? " And she cried in the same piercing , passionate voice , " Yes ! " Then Wang the Tiger leaned forward indolently and he said quietly and very scornfully , " I have killed him . Now you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the young woman lunged forward as if she would have fallen upon him and killed him if she could and the two guards struggled with her , and Wang the Tiger watched them . When they had her fast again so she could not move , the sweat poured down her temples and she was gasping and half weeping , but she stood and fixed her furious eyes on Wang the Tiger 's face . Then he met her eyes and stared at her and she stared back at him in defiance , and as though she did not fear him and would not look away and as if she had determined to down his look before she lowered her own bold eyes . But Wang the Tiger only stared on indomitably and without any anger visible , and with a mighty and calm patience and for all his depth of anger he had a power of such strong patience if he were not angry . As for the woman , she stared on for a long time . But at last , althoughhe still stared unmoved , her eyelids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the guards , " Oh , take me away to the gaol again ! " And she would not look at him any more . Then Wang the Tiger , smiling in the mirthless way he had , said to her , " You see , I said you have a new master . " But she would not answer him anything . She stood suddenly droopingand she parted her lips and panted a little , and at last he told the guards to take her away again and this time she went without any struggle , glad to go away from him . Then Wang the Tiger was all the more curious to know who she was and he was very curious to know how she came to be in the robbers ' lair and he had it in his mind to know her story . So when the guard came back shaking his head and saying , " I have had wild onesP139in my hand in my day , but not like this tigress , " Wang the Tiger said to him , " Tell the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why she was in the lair . " " She will not answer any question , " said the guard . " No , she says nothing . The only change in her was that at first she would not eat hut now she eats ravenously , yet not as though she were hungry but as though she ate to be strong for a purpose . But she will not tell anyone who she is . The women are curious and they have tried every cunning way to question her but she will not tell . Torture may force it from her , but even then I do not know , for she is so fierce and bitter a thing . Do you order torture , my general ? " Wang the Tiger thought for a while , then and at last he set his teeth together and he said , " If there is no other way , let it be by torture , She is to obey me . But it is not to be torture to her death . " And after a while he said again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mar her skin . " At the end of the day the guard came to him once more to make report and he said in consternation , " My general , high above me , it is not possible to make that woman say anything so long as we must torture her so gently as to break , no bones and not mar her skin . She laughs at us . " Then Wang the Tiger looked at him gloomily and he said , " Let her he for the time then . And give her meats and some wine to eat and to drink . " And he put the matter into the recesses of his mind , until he could think what to do with her . Then while he waited for a thought to come to him , Wang the Tiger sent his trusty harelipped man southward to his old home and he bade the man tell his brothers all that had befallen him and how great his success was and how he had won it and lost but a few men , and how he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , saying , " You are not to boast too much of what I have done , for this small place and this little county seat is but the first step up the high mountain of glory before me , and you must not let my brothers think I am as high as I plan to go , or they will come hanging on me and beg me to foist up this son of theirs or that and I want no more of their sons , no , even though I have not the son of my own I wish I had . Tell them the small measure of my success , and tell it so that they will be encouraged to give me the moneys I need still , for I have five thousand men now to feed and clothe , and they eat like wolves . But tell them I have begun and I shall go on until I have this province in my rule and after that more provinces . There is no boundary to my way . "   To all this the trusty man gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor pilgrim who goes to worship at some distant temple . As for Wang the Tiger he set himself then to the settling of his men and it was true he had every right to take pride in what he had done . He had established himself honorably and not as a common robber chief and he was established in the magistrate 's court and as part of the government of that country . And everywhere by river and lake his fame went forth through that region and everywhere people spoke of the Tiger , and when he opened his lists for anyone to take service underhim , as he now did , men flocked to his banners . But he chose them carefully and he rejected the old and unfit and such as looked weak or half blind or imbecile , and he paid off such of the state soldiers as did not seem able or strong , and there were many of these who had been in the army merely to have food to eat . Thus Wang the Tiger gathered to himself a mighty army of nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit for war . He took the hundred he had in the beginning , except the few who had been killed in the brawl with the robbers or who had been burned in the lair , and these he raised into captains and sergeants over the new men . But when all this was done , Wang the Tiger did not , as many men in his place would have done , sit in idleness and ease to eat and drink . No , he made himself rise early , even in the winter , and he taught and trained his men and he forced them to learn every skill of war and battle that he knew himself , and how to feint and to attack and to ambush , and how to retreat without loss . Everything he could he made up his mind he would teach them , for he had no purpose to stay forever in this small court of a county magistrate . No , his dreams were swelling in him , and he let them grow as great as they would . Now the two elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear how he did with his venture , but each brother showed it in his own way . Wang the Eldest , since his son had hanged himself , pretended to have no more interest in his brother , and he mourned his son whenever he thought of him . His lady did , also , but her mourning found comfort in complainingagainst her husband and she said , often , " I said from the first he ought not to go . I said from the first that it was an ill thing for a family like ours to send so good a son for a soldier . It is a low common life , and I said so . " P141At first Wang the Eldest had been foolish enough to make answer to her and to say , " Now , lady , I did not know you were unwilling , and it seemed to me you were ready enough , the more because he was to be no common soldier but my brother would raise him as he raised himself . " But this lady had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she cried out vehemently , " You never do know what I say because your mind is always on something elsesome woman or other , I suppose ! I said plainly and often that he ought not to goand what is your brother but a commonsoldier ? If you had listened to me , our son would have been living and well today and he was our best son and framed to be a scholar . But I am never listened to in my own house ! " She sighed and made a piteous face and Wang the Eldest looked east and west and he was very uneasy to have called this storm on himself and he did not answer a word , hoping that the force of her anger would spend itself more quickly thus . The truth was that now her son was dead the lady continually moaned that he had been her best son after all , although when he lived she scolded him too , and found fault with him , and thought her eldest son the best by much . But now the eldest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead son seemed better . There was that third and hunchbacked one , but she never asked for him after she heard he liked to live with Pear Blossom , as he now did wholly , and she said if anyone spoke of him , " He is not strong and the country air is good for him . " She sent a little present to Pear Blossom sometimes in lieu of thanks , some small , useless thing or other , a little bowl of flowered pottery or a bit of cheap cloth only partly silk but brave in show or color , such as Pear Blossom never wore . But Pear Blossom always thanked her prettily , whatever the gift , and sent back fresh eggs or some produce of the land , careful always to return something and so owe nothing . Then she took the cloth and gave it to the fool , or she made a gay coat or shoes to please the poor thing , and she gave the pottery bowl to the hunchback if he liked it , or to the farmer 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancied the flowery town stuff more than her own blue and white ware . As for Wang the Second he waited in his own way to hear what his younger brother did , and he listened secretly here and there and he heard rumors that the robber chief to the north of them had been killed by a new young brave , but he did not know if it were true or not or if the brave were his brother or not . So he waited and saved his money until the trusty man came , and he sold Wang the Tiger 's lands when he could do it prudently , and he put the money out at very high interest , and if he turned the money over a time or two more than he told anyone , this he considered his just wage for all the trouble he had for his brother , and he did no injury to his brother thus , for no one else would have done as well as he did for Wang the Tiger . But on the day when the harelipped trusty man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to hear his tale , and with an unused eagerness upon his face he drew the trusty man into his own room and poured tea out for him , and then the trusty man told what he had to say , and Wang the Second heard it through to the end without a word . When it was finished , and the trusty man told it exactly and well and he ended as Wang the Tiger had told him to end , saying , " Your brother and my general says we are not to be hasty and say he has climbed his mountain because this is but his first step and ' he holds but a small county seat and he dreams of provinces . " Then Wang the Second drew his breath in a little and he asked , " But do you think he is sure enough so that I can safely risk my own silver on him ? " Then the trusty man answered , " Your brother is a very clever man and many a man would have been content to settle into the robbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . But your brother is too wise for that , knowing that a robber must turn respectablebefore he can be a king , and so he has the power of state behind him . Yes , although it is only a small magistrate 's seat , still it is the state and he is a state 's general , and when he goes out to fight with other lords of war and when he finds a cause of quarrel with someone as he will when the spring comes , then he can go out as one with authorityand not as rebel . " Such caution as this pleased Wang the Second very much , and so he said with more than usual heartiness , the hour being near to noon , " Come out and eat and drink with us , if you will bear our common meal , " and he took the man with him and set him at their family table . Then when Wang the Second 's wife saw the trusty man she cried a greeting to him in her hearty way and she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trusty man rose to his feet then and answered that her son was very well and he did . well and the general was minded to raise him up , doubtless , for he kept him always about his person . But before he could say a word , the woman shouted that he was to sit and not stand in courtesy . So when he had sat down again he thought to tell them about how the lad had gone to the robbers ' lair and how tricky he was and how neatly he had done what he had to do . But he stopped him-P143self , because he knew that women are so strange and their tempers are uncertain , and mothers are the strangest of all , for they see fears and harms about their children where there are no such things . He contented himself with silence , therefore , when he had said enough to please her . In a few minutes she had forgotten all she asked , for she was busy about many things , and she bustled here and there fetching bowls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a babe at her breast as she worked . The child suckled tranquilly , while with her free arm she was zealous in dipping out food to the guest and to her husband and to the clamoring , hungry children who did not eat at the table , but stood at the door or on the street with their bowls and chopsticks , and when their bowls were empty they came running in for fresh rice and vegetables and meats . When the meal was over and they had finished their tea after they ate , Wang the Second took the trusty man to his elder brother 's gate , and there he bade the man wait until he could call his brother out and then they would go to a tea house to talk . But he told the man not to show himself lest the lady see him and they would need to go and hear her talk for a time . And so saying Wang the Second went inside and through a court or two to his elder brother 's own rooms , and there he found him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red coals , snoring after his noon meal . But when Wang the Eldest felt his brother 's light touch on his arm he started out of his sleep with a snort , and after being dazed for a while he understood what was wanted and he struggled up and drew on the fur robes he had laid aside , and he followed his brother softly so that he would not be heard . No one saw them go out except his pretty concubine who thrust her head out of a door to see who passed , and Wang the Eldest held up his hand as a sign of silence , and she let him go , for if she were timid and fearful of the lady , she was a kind , mild creature , too , and she could lie kindly and she would say she had not seen him , if she were asked . They went together to the tea house and there the trusty man told his story over again , and Wang the Eldest groaned in his heart that he had not a son to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second brother 's son did so well . But he kept it to himself for once , and he only spoke well to the man and he agreed to all his brother said in the matter of moneys to be sent back , and he waited until he reached his home again . Then suddenly it seemed as though his heart overflowed with jealousyand he went and sought out his eldest son . The young man lay in the curtained bed in his own room , and he lay there idle and flushed and reading a loose lascivious tale called The Three Fair Women , and he started when he saw his father come in and he hid the book under his robe . But his father did not even see it he was so full of what he had come to say and began in haste , " Son , do you still wish to go to be with your uncle and rise with him to a high place ? " But the young man had outgrown that moment in his life and now he yawned delicately , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's when he opened it thus and he looked at his father and smiled idly and he said , " Was I ever so foolish as to want to go for a soldier ? " " But you will not be a soldier , " urged his father anxiously . " You will be from the first much higher than soldier , and next your uncle . " Then he lowered his voice , coaxing his son , " Your uncle is a general already and he has established himself by the wisest guile I ever heard of , and the worst is over . " But the young man shook his head wilfully , and Wang the Eldest , half angered and half helpless , looked at his son lying there on his bed . Some truthful sight came to this man at this instant , and he saw his son for what he was , a young man dainty and fastidious and idle , without any single ambition for anything except his pleasure , and his only fear that he was not better dressed and less in fashion than other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eldest saw his son lying on the silken quilts of his bed , and the young man wore silk to his very skin , and he had satin shoes on his feet and his skin was like a beauty 's skin , oiled and perfumed , and his hair was perfumed and smoothed with some foreign oil also . For the young man studied to make his body beautiful in every way , and well nigh he worshipped it for its softness and beauty , and his reward was that there were many who praised him for it among those whom he played with at night in gaming houses and playhouses . Yes , he was a young lord in a rich man 's house , as anyone could see , and none would have dreamed that his grandfather was one Wang Lung , a farmer , and a man of the earth . For this one instant did Wang the Eldest see his eldest son , although he was a man muddled and confused with many small things , and he was frightened for his son and he cried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am afraid for you , my son ! I am afraid you will come to no good end ! " Then he cried out more sharply than he ever had to this son of his , " I say you shall go and hew out some sort of a way of life and not grow old here in idle slothful pleasure ! " And he wished in a sort of fright , which he did not understand in himself , that they had seized on the moment of the lad 's ambition . But it was too late ; the moment was gone . When the young man heard the unwonted sound of his father 's voicep145be cried out half afraid , half petulant , sitting up suddenly in his bed , " Where is my mother ? I will go and ask my mother if she will have me go or not , and I will see if she is so anxious to be rid of me ! " But Wang the Eldest , hearing this , fell back into himself again , and he said hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please since you are my eldest ! " And the cloud descended upon him again and the moment of clarity was gone . He sighed and thought to himself that it was true that young lords could not be as other common youths were , and he said to himself that it was true his brother 's wife was a very common woman , and doubtless his pocked son was little better than a servant to his uncle . So Wang the Eldest consoled himself vaguely and he shuffled as he went out from his son 's room . As for the young man , he lay back on his silk-covered pillow again , and he clasped his hands under his bead and smiled his indolent smile , and after a while he felt for the book he had hidden and took it out and began to read it ardently once more , for it was a naughty , zestful book that a friend of his had commendedto him . But Wang the Eldest could not forget his vague despondency and it . hung on him still so that for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he thought it was . It was a very sore thing to him that when he had seen the trusty man gone again , his pilgrim 's wallet filled with silver and his belt stiff with silver about his waist , and his bundle filled with it so that he could hardly heave the thing to his back , that he could not think of anything Wang the Tiger could do for him yet , and it seemed a sore thing to him and his life very weary because he had no son to whom he could look for glory and he had nothing but his land that he hated and yet did not dare to part with altogether . His lady even saw his despondency and in his extremity he told her some of his trouble , and she had taught him so well that in his secret heart he did believe her wiser than himself , although he would have denied it stoutly if anyone had asked him if he did . But this time she gave him no help , for when he tried to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with scorn and she said , " A general at a small county seat is no great lord of war , my poor old man , and you are silly to be so envious of him ! When he is lord of war in the province it will be time enough to tell off our younger son to him , and more likely it will be your smallest son who is only a suckling now at the other 's breast ! " So Wang the Eldest sat silent then and for a time he did not go out as zestfully as he had to his pleasure places , and not even talk with his many friends seemed the worth it had before . No , he sat alone and he was not one to sit thus either , for he was a man who liked to be where there were people running to and fro in a commotion of some sort or other , even though it were but household bustle and servants bickering with a vendor and children crying and quarreling and the usual uproar of daily living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now he sat alone because he was wretched and he did not know why he was except that for the first time it came to him that he was not so young as he was once and his age was creeping on him unawares , and it seemed to him he had not found the good in life he might have found and he was not so great as he should have been . Chiefest of all his vague miseries was one not vague , and it was the land he had from his father . It was a curse to him for it was his only livelihood and he must give it some oversight or he would have nothing to eat , he and his children and his wives and servants , and it seemed to him as though there were some vile magic in that land , and it was always seed time and he must go out to it or time to fertilize and he must see to it or it was harvest and he must stand in the hot sun and measure out grain or it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hateful round of the land , forcing him to labor when he was by nature a man of leisure and a lord . Yes , even though he had an agent , there was some shrewdness in this man , even against his will , that made his gorge rise to think the agent grew rich at his expense , so that although he hated it he dragged himself each season to the place where he could oversee what was done . He sat now in his own room and now under a tree in the court outside it if the winter sun were warm enough and he groaned to think how he must go out year after year or the robbers who rented his land from him would give him nothing . Yes , they were forever howling , " Ah , we have had floods this year , " and " Ah , we have such a drought as never was , " or else it was , " This is the year for locusts , " and they and his agent had a hundred tricks against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strife with them he blamed and he loathed the land . He longed for the day when Wang the Tiger would be great enough so that his elder brother need no longer go out in heat and cold ; he longed for the day when he could say , " I am brother to Wang the Tiger , " and it would suffice . Once it had seemed much that men had come to call him Wang the Landlord , for this was his name now , and it had seemed an honorable good name until this moment . The truth was this that Wang the Landlord found it very hard becauseall his life so long as his father Wang Lung had lived he had received money freely from him enough to pay for all he needed , and he never labored over its coming . But after the inheritance was divided he labored more than he ever had and yet with all this labor to whichP147he was unaccustomed he had not all the silver he needed , and his sons and wives never seemed to care how he labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they must have this furthe winter and that dainty light fur to line their robes in the spring and autumn and all kinds of silks each in its season , and it was a hardshipfit to break their hearts if they must wear a coat a little too long or a little wider in the cut than was this year 's fashion , for they feared more than anything the laughter of the young town dandies who were their companions . So with the eldest son , and now the fourth son was learning this also . Although he was but thirteen years old , he must have his little robes cut thus and so and a ring on his finger and his hair scented and oiled too , and a maid to serve him only and a man to take him out ; and because he was his mother 's darling and she feared for him at the hands of evil spirits , he wore a gold ring in one ear , too , to deceive the gods and make them think him a girl and worthless . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that there was less silver in the house than there had once been and if he said when she wanted a sum of him , " But I have not so much to give you and I can only give you fifty pieces now , " she would cry out , " 1 have promised it to the temple for a new roof over a certain god , and if I do not give it I shall lose my dignity . Indeed you have it , for I know you spend money like water on wining and gaming and on all those low women I know you have and I am the only one in this whole house who looks to the things of the soul and to gods . Some day I may have to pray your soul out of hell , and you will be sorry I had not the silver then ! " So Wang the Landlord had somehow to find the silver , although he hated it very much to see his good money going into the hands of the smooth and secret priests whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard certain very evil things . Yet he could never be sure , either , that they had not some knowledge of magic and he could never he sure , although he pretended disbelief in gods as things fit only for women , that there was not some power in them too , and this was anotherconfusion in him . The truth was that this lady of his was so deep now in her intimacy with gods and temples and all such things that she grew very holy and she spent many hours in going to this god and that , and it gave her the greatest pleasure to pass into a temple gate leaning as a great lady does upon her maids , and as she came in to see the priests of the templeand even the abbot came to her obsequious and bowing and full of flattery and full of talk that she was a favorite of the gods and a lay nun , and very near the Way . When they talked thus she simpered and smiled and cast her eyes down and deprecated , but before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them this and that and a sum of money more than she really wished to give . But the priests took care to give her full praise and they put her name up in many places as an example to all devout persons , and one temple even presented her with a wooden ensign painted vermilion red and there were gilt letters on it signifyinghow this lady was so devout and good a follower of the gods . This ensign was hung in a lesser hall of the temple , but where many might see it . After this she was the more proud and holy and devout in her looks , and she studied to sit calmly always and to fold her hands and often she went holding her rosary and muttering the syllables of her prayer while others gossiped or talked idly . Therefore being so holy she was very hard with her husband and she would have what silver she needed to keep up the name she had . When Wang the Landlord 's younger wife saw what the lady had she wanted her little share , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , prate of them to please the lady , but still she wanted her silver . And Wang the Landlord could not think what she did with it , because she did not dress herself in fine flowered silks or buy jewels and gold things for her dress and hair . Yet the money went from her quickly , too , and Wang the Landlord did not complain lest the girl go and weep before the lady , and the lady reproach him that since he had taken such an qne he ought to pay her something . For these two women liked each other in some strange cool way , and they stood togetheragainst their husband if they wanted something for themselves . One day Wang the Landlord did find out the truth , however , for he saw his younger wife slip out to a side gate and take something from her bosom and give it to one who stood there , and Wang the Landlord peered and he saw the man was her old father . Then was Wang the Landlord very bitter and he thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his family , too ! " And he went into his own room and sat and sighed and was very bitter for a while and he groaned to himself . But it was no use , and he could do nothing for if she chose to give what she had from her husband to her father and not to spend it on sweetmeats and clothing and such things as most women love , she had this right , except that a woman ought to cleave first to the house of her husband . But Wang the Landlord did not feel he could contend with her and he let it pass . And Wang the Landlord was the more torn in himself , for he could not control his own desires , even though he did now honestly try for the first time in his life when he was nearly fifty years old , to spend less for his love of women . But he had his weakness with him yet , and he could not bear to be thought a niggard among them when his fancy fixed itself . Besides these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl established as a transient wife by common agreement in anotherP149part of the city . But she was a pretty leech , and although he had finished with her soon , she held him by her threats of killing herself and of loving him above all the world , and she cried on his bosom and fixed her little sharp fingers into the deep flesh on his neck and she hung to him so that he did not know what to do with her . With her she had her old mother also , a vile hag , and she in her turn screeched out , " How can you cast off my daughter who has given you all ? How would she live now , seeing that she has not been in a playhouse all these years you have had her and her voice is gone and others have taken her place ? No , I will defend her and I will take her case to the magistrate if you cast her off ! " This frightened Wang the Landlord very much , for he feared the laughter of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribald talk that she would vent against him in court if she could , so that he fumbled hastily for what silver he had . When the two women saw he was afraid , they plotted and made every opportunity they could for storm and weeping , knowing that when they did , he would pay them in haste . And the strangest thing of all was that with so many troubles , this great fat weak man still could not keep himself free , but must still be overcome with his desires at a feast somewhere and pay a new little singing girl he saw , even though when he came home and was himself on the next day , he groaned at his own folly and cursed his own fulsome heart . But now , pondering all this during these weeks of his despondency he grew frightened at his own zestlessness , and he did not even care to eat so much as he had , and when he found his appetite for food waning he was frightened lest he die too soon , and he said to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he determined that he would sell a good large share of his land and live on the silver , and he thought to himself secretly that he would spend what was his and his sons must care for themselves if there was not enough left for their lifetime . And it seemed to him suddenly that it was a vain thing for a man to stint himself for those who live on after him . He rose wilfully then and he went to his second brother and he said , " I am not fitted for the cares of a landlord 's life , for I am a city man , a man of leisure . No , I can not with my increasing weight and years go out at seed time and harvest , and if I do one day I shall drop dead with the heat or the cold . I have not lived with common people , either , and they cheat me before I know it and out of all my land and my labor . Now this I ask of you . Act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me now and let me have the money as I need it , and what I do not need put out at interest for me , and let me be free of this accursed land . The other half I will keep to leave to my sons . But there is not one of them who will help me with it now , and when I say to my eldest son that he is to go for me sometimes to the land he is always pressed with a meeting with some friend or he has a headacheand we shall starve if we continue as we are now . Only the tenants grow rich from the land . " Then Wang the Second looked at this brother of his , and he despised him in his heart , but he said smoothly , " I am your brother , and I will not take any commission at all for selling it and I will sell it for you to anyone who bids highest for it . But you must say what your lowest price is for each lot . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his land and he said quickly , " You are my brother and sell it for what you think fair . Shall I not trust my own brother ? " He went away then in high good humor because he was rid of half of his burden and he could go his way for a time and wait for silver to come into his hands as he longed to do again . But he did not tell his lady what he had done , because she might cry out against him that he had given them over into the other 's hand , and she would say that if he wished to sell , he ought to sell it himself to some among the many rich men with whom he feasted and with whom he seemed in such deep friendship , and Wang the Landlord did not wish to do this , for in his heart , for all his bluster , he trusted his brother 's wit more than he did his own . And now having done this , his heart rose again and he could eat once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and he thought to himself there were others more troubledthan he , and he was ardent again . Now Wang the Second grew more content than ever for he had all in his own hands . He planned that he would buy the best of his brother'slands for himself . It was true that he paid a fair price for them , for he was not a dishonest man as men are reckoned , and indeed he told his elder brother that he bought a little of the best land to keep it in the family . But how much of the land he bought Wang the Landlorddid not know , for Wang the Second had him sign the deeds when he was somewhat drunken and he did not look to see what name was on it , but being full of the good humor of drunkenness hii brother seemed excellent to him and wholly to be trusted . He would not have been willing had he known to see so much of his land pass into Wang the Second 's keeping , perhaps , and so Wang the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to whom it was who wished to buy . And it was true that Wang the Second did sell much land thus . But Wang Lung had been very wise in his day and he bought far more good land than any other kind , and so when all the business was over Wang the Second ' had in his own personal possession and forP151the best and the choicest of all his father 's land , for he had sothe best of the younger brother 's inheritance also . And with land he planned he would supply much of the grain to his own and increase his stores of silver and gold , and he grew powerthetown and in that region , and men called him Wang the ant. unless he knew it no one would have dreamed this small meager was so rich , for Wang the Merchant still ate the plain spare bit I he always did and took no new wife into his house as most will when they are rich , for show if for nothing else , and he wore me sort of small patterned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn . In his house they added no new furniture , and incourts there was no flower nor any waste thing , and what had beenbefore now was dead , for his wife was thrifty and raised flocksof fowls and these ran in and out of the rooms to pick up bits of foodchildren dropped , and they ran about the courts and plucked every blade and green leaf , so that the courts were bare except for a old pines , and the earth grew hard and packed . Nor would Wang the Merchant let his sons be spendthrift nor idle . o. he planned for each one , and each had a few years of schooling learn to read and write and to count skilfully upon the abacus . Butwould not let them stay long enough to be held scholars in any for scholars will not labor at anything , and he planned apprene:hipsfor them and they were to come into his business . The pocked e he considered his younger brother 's , and the next one he planned make his steward on the land , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years old . In the earthen house Pear Blossom lived on with the two children and every day of her life was like the one before it , and she asked no more than that it should be so always . She grieved no more for the land , for if she did not see the elder she saw the younger son of her dead lord come out before harvest time to estimate the growth of grain and to see the seed weighed off and all such things . Yes , and she heard , too , how Wang the Merchant , for all he was a townsman , was sharper as landlord than his brother even , for he knew to a ten catty weight what a field still standing in green grain would give , and his narrow little eyes were always sharp to see if a tenant pressed his foot secretly against the side of a load to weigh it down or if he poured water into the rice or the wheat to make it swell . His years in the grain market had taught him everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they are enemies by nature . But if Pear Blossom asked whether any ever saw him angry when he found out a trick , the answer always came with unwilling admiration that he was never angry . No , he was only implacable and calm and more clever than any of them , and the nickname he had in that whole countryside was this , " He Who Wins in Every Bargain . " It was a scornful name and full of hatred , and all the country people hated Wang the Merchant very heartily . But he did not care and he was even pleased to know what they called him , and he knew because an angry farm wife shouted it at him once with curses when he saw her sink a great round stone into the heart of a basket of grain about to be weighed , and she had done it when she thought his back was turned . More than a time or two did a farm woman curse him , for a bittertonguedwoman is bolder than any man , and if a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his nature was , but a woman would curse and she would cry out after him , " How is it that in one generation you forget how your father and your mother toiled on the land even as we do and they starved too , as we must , when you grind our blood and bones as you do now ? " Wang the Landlord had grown afraid sometimes when the people grew bitter , for he knew the rich may well fear the poor , who seem so patient and humble and who can be so bold and ruthless when they turn to rend whom they hate . But Wang the Merchant feared nothing , and it was nothing to him even when one day Pear Blossom saw him pass and she called to him and came out and said , " If so be , sir , my lord 's son , that you can be a little less exact with the people , I should be glad . They labor very hard and they are poor and like children in ignorance , oftentimes . It goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes , about my lord 's sons . " But Wang the Merchant only smiled and went his way . It was nothing to him what any said or did , so long as he had his full profits . His was the power and he feared nothing , for he felt himself secure in his riches . Now the winter wore on very long and cold in those parts and in the time of bitter winds and in the fury of wind-driven snows Wang the Tiger could but stay on in the magistrate 's courts in the place that was now his and wait for the spring to come . He entrenched himself in his place and he steadily demanded from the magistrate this tax and that for his eight thousand soldiers . Yes , there was even a tax put on all land for his benefit and it was called the tax for the protection of the people by the state soldiery , but this soldiery was really Wang the Tiger 's own private army , and he taught themp153and trained them and made them ready to enlarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Every farmer in that whole regionpaid something on every field he had and he paid it out for Wang the Tiger ; and because the robbers were gone and the lair burned and they need not fear the Leopard any more , the common folk were full of praise for Wang the Tiger and they were ready to pay him well , but still they did not know how well this was . There were other taxes also that Wang the Tiger had the magistrate lay for him , some on shops and markets , and every traveller who came through that town , which was a pass between north and south , paid a tax and every merchant paid a tax on the goods he took back and forth for sale and barter , and so the money poured steadily and secretly into Wang the Tiger 's stores . He was sharp enough , too , to see that it did not touch too many hands in passing , knowing that no hand in this world will readily release as much silver as it grasps . He appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and although these spoke smoothly to all and he commanded them so to speak , yet he gave them the power over anyone they found taking more than his share , and he told each trusty man that he would punish them himself if they failed him . He was safer than most from treachery for everyone feared him for a ruthless man . Yet they knew him to be just , too , and they knew he did not kill any man carelessly or for mere pleasure . But as Wang the Tiger waited for the winter to be gone he chafed very much in spite of his success , for this life in the magistrate 's courtyardsdid not suit him . No , and there were none who could be his friends , for he would not bring himself to intimacy with any , knowing that as long as people feared him he could hold his place the more easily among them ; besides , he was one who did not by nature love to take part in feasting and friendship , and he lived alone except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he need something , and his trusty harelipped man who was his chief guard . The truth was that now the magistrate was so old and given to his opium pipe , everything ran slackly about him and his courts were filled with cliques and jealousies and crowded with underlings and underlings ' relatives who sought an easy way to live . This man turned against that , and there were deep angers and revenges and quarrels continually . But if these were brought to the old magistrate 's ears he turned himself to his opium or he thought of something else , for well he knew he could not settle everything , and he lived alone with his old wife in an inner court and he only came out when he must . But he tried to do his state duty still , and every audience day at dawn he rose and put on his official robes and he went into his audience hall and ascended the dais there and sat down in the chair from whence he heard his cases .   He did his poor best , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , and he supposed he meted out justice to such as came before him there . But he did not know that every suppliant who came before him had paid his way through from the very gateman at the gates , so that any man who had not silver enough for high and low could not hope even to reach that audience hall , and the very councillors who stood in the presence of the magistrate had each received his share . Nor did the old magistrate know he leaned so heavily on these councillors of his . No , for he was old and easily confused and often he did not catch the point of a case and he was ashamed to say he did not , or he dozed somewhat toward the end of the hour , and did not hear what was said , and he was afraid to ask again , lest men think him not able . So he turned naturallyto his councillors who never failed to flatter him and when they said , " Ah , this man is evil and that man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree hastily and say " It is what I thoughtit is what I thought , " and when they cried out , " Such an one ought to be well beaten because he is so lawless , " the old magistrate would quaver forth , " Yesyes , let him be beaten ! " Now in these idle days Wang the Tiger often went to the audience hall to see and to hear and to pass the time away , and when he went he sat to one side and his trusty men and his pocked nephew stood about him as a guard . Thus he heard and saw all this injustice . At first he said to himself that he would pay no heed to any of these things , for he was a lord of war and these civil affairs were no business of his , and he would spend his care on his soldiers , seeing that they did not share in the loose , idle life of the courts , and many a time when he saw that which made him angry in the audience hall he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to marches and to practicesof war , whatever the winds were that day , and so he relieved his heart of the pressure of its anger . But he was a man just at heart and when he saw the injustice go on time after time he could not bear it at last , and he grew surcharged with anger against some of the councillors who had the ear of the magistrate , and especially against the chief councillor . Yet he knew it was no use to say anything to the weak old man . But still , when he had sat sometimes and listened to cases and when he had seen injustice done a hundred times , he grew so pent in himself that he would rise and stride away and he muttered to himself many times , " If spring does not come quickly I shall kill someone against my will ! " As for the councillors , they did not love him , either , because he securedso much revenue and they mocked him for a coarsely bred fellow and one beneath them in polish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day in a sudden wayP155that he himself had not expected , and it began with a small matter enough , even as a mighty storm will begin sometimes with only a little wind and a handful of ragged cloud . It happened on a certain day before the new year , when men are out everywhere to collect debts and those who owe hide as best they may so that they can not be found until the first day of the new year when debts can not be collected from anyone , that the old magistrate bad his last audience day of the old year and he sat upon his dais . On that day Wang the Tiger had been very restless because he was so idle . He would not game because he did not want his soldiers to see him at it and feel the more free themselves to do it , and he could not read overmuchbecause novels and tales weaken a man , they are so full of dreams and the stuffs of love , and he was not scholar enough for the old philosophies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guard and sat awhile in the audience room to see who would come that day . But in his heart he was pent and impatient for the spring , and especially because the last ten days had been so cold and so filled with a downpour of constant rain that his men cried out against being taken out of their quarters . There he sat , and it seemed to him that his was the dreariest life , and there was not one soul to care if he lived or died , and so he sat , listless and glowering in his usual place . Presently he saw a certain rich man come in whom he knew , having seen him here before . This man was a usurer of the town , a smooth-faced , fat man , with very small , smooth , yellow hands that he flourished with a sort of evil grace as he spoke , and he continually pushed back his long silken sleeves from his hands before he waved them . Many times Wang the Tiger had watched his hands and seen how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finger tips were with their long nails , and he had watched the man 's hands when he did not hear what he said , even . But today the usurer came in with a poor farmer and the farmer was very frightened and ill at ease , and he threw himself before the magistratewith his face to the ground , and remained there speechless , begging for mercy . Then the usurer told his case and it was that he had loaned a sum of money to this farmer , and had accepted his land as security . This was two years ago , and now the money with its interest had mounted above the worth of the land . " Yet in spite of this , " the usurer cried , and he pushed back his silken sleeves and moved his smooth hands and made his voice rich and reproachful , and he was very unctuous , " in spite of this , 0 honored magistrate , he will not move from his land ! " And the man rolled his little eyes around in indignation at this wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He continued to kneel there with his face bent and leaning upon his two hands forked together . At last the old magistrate asked him , " Why did you borrow and why do you not pay ? " Then the farmer looked up a little and he fixed his eyes on the magistrate 's footstool , and he continued to kneel , and he said anxiously , " Sir , I am a very common man and poor , and I do not know how to speak to such as you , honored Sir . I am very common and I have never spoken to one higher than the head in our village , and I do not know how to speak here , and yet I have no one to speak for me , seeing that I am so poor . " Then the old magistrate said kindly enough , " You need not fearonly speak on . " Then the farmer after opening his lips a time or two soundlessly began to speak , but still he did not lift his eyes at all , and it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ragged clothes from which the old wadding stuck forth out of the holes like old sheep 's wool . His feet were bare and thrust only into shoes woven out of reeds and these had now fallen from his feet , so that his hard and horny toes rested stiffly upon the damp stone floor . But he did not seem to feel.this , and he began in a weak voice and he said , " Sir , I had a little land from my fathers . It is very poor land and it has never fed us full . But my parents died early and there were only I and my wife , and if we starved we did it and that was all . But she bore a child , a son , and then after years another , a girl . When they were little it was still not so hard . But they grew and we had to wed the son and his wife had a child . Sir , think of it , the land was not enough for my wife and me and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wed and I had her to feed somehow . Two years ago I had a chance to betroth her to an old man in a village near us , for his wife was dead and he needed one to mend his household . But I had to give her a wedding garment . Sir , I had nothing so I borrowed a little moneyonly ten pieces of silver , to most men nothing , but to me very much and more than I had . I borrowed it from this usurer . In less than a year the ten pieces had grown into twenty of its own accord , for I had no more than the ten to spend . Now in two years it is forty . Sir , how can dead silver grow like that ? There is only my land . He says go , but where shall I go ? Let him come and drive me off , I say . There is nothing else than this . " When the man had finished saying this he remained perfectly silent . Wang the Tiger stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not keep his eyes from the man 's feet . The farmer 's face was drawn and sallow and told of his life and of his never being full fed since he was born . But his feet told the whole tale . There was somethingeloquent in this man 's two bare feet , knotted and gnarled in theP157toes , and the soles like the dried hide of a water buffalo . Yes , looking at the man 's feet Wang the Tiger felt something welling up in him . Nevertheless , he waited to see what the old magistrate would say . Now this usurer was a man of the town and well known and he had feasted with the magistrate many times and he kept the good will of the court with him because he paid silver to high and low in every case he had and he had many . The magistrate hesitated , therefore , although k could be seen he was somewhat moved , too . At last he turned to his chief councillor , a man near his own age but strong and straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome still , although his scanty whiskers that grew in three parts from his cheeks and chin were white . The magistrate asked this man , " What do you say , my brother ? " This man smoothed his few white whiskers then and he said slowly as though he pondered justice , but the memory of silver was warm on his palm , " It can not be gainsaid that this farmer did borrow money and he has not returned it , and money borrowed must run into interest and this is according to the law . The usurer lives by his loaned moneys as a farmer does by his land . If the farmer rented his land out and received no rent he would complain and his complaint would be just . Yet this is only what the usurer has done . It is just , therefore , that he be paid his due . " The old magistrate listened to this carefully , nodding his head from time to time , and it could be seen he was moved by it , too . But now suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked in a kind of daze from one face to the other . Yet Wang the Tiger did not sec his face or how his eyes looked . He only saw the man 's two old bare feet curl upon each other in an agony , and suddenly he could not bear it . His immense anger rushed forth and he stood up . He clapped his hands together hard and he roared in a great voice , " I say the poor man shall have his land ! " When all the people gathered in the court heard this roar come out of Wan &; the Tiger every head turned toward him , and the trusty men Wang the Tiger had , leaped to him and stood with their guns pointed fiercely and seeing them everyone shrank back and kept silent . But Wang the Tiger felt his anger released now and he could not stay it if he would and he pointed his finger at the usurer and stabbed it through the air again and again as he spoke and he shouted in a great voice , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Again and again have I seen this fat , biting insect here with some tale like this and he has greased his way in with silver to high and low ! I am weary of him ! Away with him ! " And he turned to his guard and shouted , " After him with your guns ! " Now when the people heard this they thought Wang the Tiger had gone suddenly mad and everyone turned and ran for his life . Yes , and swiftest of all to run was the fat usurer and he reached the gate ahead of them all and he went through it with a squeak like a rat that barely escapes . He was so swift and he knew so well the winding alleys that although the trusty men pursued him he was gone and they could not find him , and when they had run so far they could only draw themselvesup and look at each other with blank faces and pant awhile . And after they had looked a little more they went back through the hubbub that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court again there was an uproar indeed , for Wang the Tiger seeing what he had begun , grew reckless and he called his soldiers and cried out , " Clear me these courts of everyoneall these cursed sucking worms and all their dirty women and children ! " And his soldiers fell with zest to doing what he said and the people ran out of the courts like rats from a burning house . Yes , in less than an hour there was not a soul there except Wang the Tiger and his own men , and in the magistrate 's own courts the old magistrate and his lady and their few personal servants . These Wang the Tiger had commandedwere not to be touched . When Wang the Tiger had done all this , and it had been done in such a burst of rage as he had seldom had in his life before , although he was given to such angers , too , he went into his own room and he sat down by the table and leaned on it and breathed heavily for a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . After a time he saw that he had set a pattern for himself this day that he must followout somehow . But the more he thought the more he did not regret it , for now he felt free in his heart of all his despondency and gloom , and he felt light and brave and free and when his harelipped man stole in to see what he needed and his pocked lad brought in a jug of wine for him , he cried out to them , laughing his silent laugh as he did , " Well , at least I have cleared out a serpent 's nest this day ! " When the people of that town heard of the rebellion in the court there were many who were pleased for they had known what corruptionwas there , and while some were afraid and waited to see what Wang the Tiger would do next , there were many who came clamoring about the court gates and they cried out that there should be a time of feasting set and that the prisoners ought to be freed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the one who had benefited most by the uproar , and it was the poor farmer , was not among that crowd . No , although he had been delivered this once he could not believe that any good fortune could be in store for him , and when he heard the usurer had escaped , he groanedP159and fled back to his land , and he went to his house and crept into his bed and if anyone came to ask his wife or children where he was they said he had gone away somewhere and they did not know where he was . When Wang the Tiger heard what the people demanded he remembered that there were in the gaol some dozen or so of men whom he bad seen thrown in for one unjust cause or another and they were hopelessof coming out , for most of them were poor and had not money enough to secure their freedom . And so he was willing and he told his trusty men to free the people in the gaol , and he called out to his men that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cooks of the magistrate 's court and he had them come into his presence and be said to them loudly , " Prepare the best dishes of your native parts , the hot peppery dishes and the fish dishes to go with wine , and everything with which we can make merry . " He ordered good wines , too , and strings of firecrackers and rockets and all such things as please the people . And everyone was glad . But just before the trusty men went to fulfil his command concerningthose in the gaol Wang the Tiger suddenly thought of something , and it was that woman who was in the gaol , too . He had wanted her out a score of times during this winter , but each time he had not known what to do with her either , so he had contented himself with commandingthat she be well fed and not chained as some were . Now when he thought of the prisoners free , he thought of her and he thought to himself , " But how can I free her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her not so free that she could go away , and he was astonished at himself when he found he cared whether she came or went . He was astonished . at his own heart , and being bewildered , he called his harelipped trusty man secretly into the room where he slept and he said , " But what of that woman we had from the lair ? " Then the trusty man answered gravely , " Yes , there is she , and I wish you would let me tell the Pig Butcher to put a knife to her throat in a way he has so that little blood flows . " But Wang the Tiger looked away and he said , slowly , " She is only a woman . " And he waited awhile and said , " At least I will see her again , and then I can know what I ought to do . " The trusty man looked very downcast at this , but he said nothing and went away , and as he went Wang the Tiger called after him that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall of justice where he would go to wait for her . He went into the hall of justice then and stepped up on the dais into the old magistrate 's seat out of some strange impulse of vanity he had , P160and he thought he would like to have the woman see him , there in the great carven seat raised as it was above the other seats , and there was no one to say him nay , for the magistrate did not come out of his own rooms yet , having sent word he was ill of a flux . There Wang the Tiger sat very stiff and haughty and he kept his face smooth and proud as a hero 's ought to be . At last she came in between two guards , and she wore a plain cotton coat and trousers of some dull blue common stuff . But this common garb was not what had changed her . She had eaten well , and the gauntness of her body was changed to a fulness that was still slender . Pretty she could never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was very bold and beautiful . She came in steadily and freely and she stood before Wang the Tiger , quiet and waiting . He looked at her in greatest astonishment , for he had not dreamed of a change like this , and he said to the guards , " Why is she so still now , seeing how mad she was before ? " And they shook their heads and moved their shoulders and said , " We do not know , except that when she went out from our captain last time she went broken and weak as though some evil spirit had passed from her , and she has been like this ever since . " " Why did you not tell me ? " said Wang the Tiger in a low voice . " I would have had her freed . " The guards were astonished at this and they said to excuse themselves , " Sir , how could we know that our general cared what came to her ? We waited for your commands . " Then words flew of their own accord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he all but cried them out , " But I do care ! " He did but barely stop them for how could he say such a thing out before all these guards and before this woman ? " Loose her from those bonds ! " he shouted suddenly . Without a word they loosed her and she stood free and they all waited to see what she would do , and Wang the Tiger waited also . She stood there as though she were still bound and she did not move . Then Wang the Tiger called out to her sharply , " You are freeyou may go where you will ! " But she answered , " Where shall I go , seeing I have no home any-where ? " And saying this , she lifted up her head and looked at Wang the Tiger with a sudden seeming simplicity . At that look the sealed fountain in Wang the Tiger was unstopped and such a passion rushed out into his blood that he began to tremble within his soldiers ' clothes . Now it was his eyes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room was filled with the air of this passion that had been stopped so long and men stirred uneasilyP161and stared at each other . Suddenly Wang the Tiger remembered they were there and he roared at them , Get you gone , every one of you , and stand outside the door ! " they went away then , crestfallen , for they saw well enough whatbefallen their general , even that which may befall any man , high low . They went out then , and waited upon the threshold . When there were none but these two left in the hall , Wang the Tiger ncd forward out of his carven seat and he said in a hard , hoarse voice , " Woman , you are free . Choose where you will go and I will send one take you there . " And she answered simply , with all the boldness gone out of her , ex-t that she could look at him in the eyes while she said it , I have chosen already . I am your bondswoman . " If Wang the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what was lawful and decent he might have taken thiswoman , since she had no father or brother or any man to stand for her , and he might have done as he liked with her . But that hour in hisyouth which had been like a blow upon his heart made him fastidious still and it made his pleasure more keen to think he could wait , with all his passion , until he could have her as a wife . Moreover , he wanted her as wife , for mingled with all his personal passion for her , which fell more deeply on him hour by hour , was the craving also to have a son by her , his son , his first-born son , and only a true wife can bear a man his true son . Yes , half of the exultation of his secret longing for her was this , to think what a son they would form between them , he with his power and great tall body and all he had to bestow , and she with her fox-like beauty and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dreamed of it , it seemed his son lived already . In great haste , then , he called his harelipped trusty man and he bade him thus , " Go to my brothers and tell them I want my share of the silver that was left to me when I should want to wed . I need it now for my marriage , for I have set my will upon this woman . Tell them to give me a thousand pieces of silver , for I have presents to give her and my men must have a very great feast on such a day and I must buy myself a new robe fit for the day . But if he gives you eight hundred , come back with it , and do not delay for the rest . And bid my brothers come and see the marriage , too , they and all they care to bring with them . " The trusty man listened to this in greatest consternation , and his lower jaw hung hideously and he stammered forth in an agony ,   " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for daya timenot wed " " Be silent , fool ! " Wang the Tiger roared at him then , starting from his seat at the man . " Did I ask your counsel ? I will order y beaten like a common criminal ! " The man hung his head then silent , but tears rose into his eyes a he went on his errand very heavily , for he felt the woman would brit his master nothing but evil and he muttered many times as he we along the road , " Yes , and I have seen these fox women ! Yes , and my general wi never believe any evil I tell him ! These fox women do always fasts themselves on the best menit is always so ! " Thus he went along the road , his feet stirring the dust that lay thick through the dry winter days , and men passing him stared at him curio ous because of his muttering and because of his tears that rolled down his cheeks sometimes without his knowing it , and when they saw he paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , they set him down as mad , and gave him the wider half of the road . But when this trusty man came with his message to Wang the Merchant , that one was for once startled out of his secret calm and he looked up from his table where he sat casting up accounts , for the trusty man , finding him not at his house , had come straight to his grain shop , and there he was at his desk in a corner behind the counters . He looked up and said in agitation , his pen arrested in his hand , " But how can I suddenly withdraw so much money from the places where I have it loaned out ? My brother ought to tell me when he is betrothed and so give me warning of a year or two . Such haste is scarcely decent in a wedding ! " Now Wang the Tiger knew his brother and how loath he was to part with money and so he had also told his trusty man before he went , " If my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him plainly I will have the money if I have to come and fetch it myself . I will carry this thing through in three days after you return , and you are not to be away more than five . There is need for haste , for I do not know how long it will be before I have an army march down on me from above , for I can not hope to remain unnoticed when the provincial ruler hears what I did in these courts . He will send men against me , even , and there can be no feasting and wedding on a battlefield ! " Now it was true enough that what Wang the Tiger had done by violencehe must expect to be heard in the courts above him and it was true that he might be punished . But there was a deeper truth than this , and it was that Wang the Tiger was so hungry for this woman he could not wait for her longer than he must , and he knew he was uselessas a warrior until he could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . Therefore he had urged his trusty and he grew fierce in his urging and he added , ell I know that merchant brother of mine will howl that he hashis money where he can not get it . You are not to heed him . Tell him I my sword still , and the very swift and fine sword that I took from Leopard when I killed him ! " the trusty man kept this threat as a last resort and he did not use at the first , and not until Wang the Merchant seemed about to on another score , and it was that it was a shame to the family to into it a woman who had no family and no home , and had been atrollop , perhaps , as such women are . But the trusty man , did not tell it was a woman out of a robbers ' lair . No , although he was sorelytempted to tell it and tempted to hold back the woman by any means , he knew Wang the Tiger well enough to know he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used his threat. en Wang the Merchant had to scour about and get what silver he d , and he was in great distress of mind that he was compelled to in money suddenly like this and lose its interest , and he went verygloomily to his elder brother and said , The sum of money due our younger brother for his marriage hefor now , and he is going to wed some trollop or other whom we e never heard of ! He is more like you than me , after all . " Wang the Landlord scratched his head at this and cast about for an wet , and then decided on peace , and he said , It is a strange thing , for I thought he would call upon us when het the need and when he was established , and ask us to betroth him properly , since our father is dead who should have done it for him . Yes , I had a maid or two in mind even . " And in his heart he thought that surely he would have chosen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well , and all the best maids , at least by hearsay , who were in the town . But Wang the Merchant had been driven very irritable with the exincyand he sneered and said , " Be sure you have a maid or two in mind ! But that is nothing to me . The thing is what can you give of this thousand he wants , for I have no such great amount of cash to take out of my girdle suddenly like this ! " Wang the Elder stared heavily at his brother , then , and he sat staring with his hand on his fat knees , and he said huskily , " You know all I have . I never have any ready silver . Sell a piece of my land again . " Then Wang the Merchant groaned a little , for it was not a good time to sell before the New Year , and he had counted on the harvests of wheat to which the land was all planted . But after he had gone back toP164his shop and had fingered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found it would pay him to sell more land rather than to draw his money out of the places of high interest where he had it , and so he sold a fair field , and when he let it be known , many came to buy of him . He sold the land for a thousand pieces and a little odd sum over , but he gave the trusty man only nine hundred pieces , and held back the rest , lest Wang the Tiger demand more . But the trusty man was a simple fellow , and he remembered that his master told him he was not to delay for a hundred pieces or so , and he went away with what he had . And Wang the Merchant hastened to put out at interest what had not been asked for , and he was a little comfortedthat he had saved this much , at any rate . There was but one untoward thing in this transaction he made , and it was that when he sold the land he sold a piece or two not far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the threshingfloor in front of the house . When she saw the knot of men gathered about the field , she shaded her eyes with her hand and looked through the sunshine and she knew what was being done . She hastened then to Wang the Merchant 's side and motioned him back a little from the others , and she opened her eyes with reproach and said to him , " Again do you sell the land ? " But Wang the Merchant would not be troubled with her when he had so much else to trouble him , and he said bluntly , " My younger brother is to be wed , and there is no other provision for the sum that is rightfully his for such a purpose except to sell a piece . " Then Pear Blossom shrank back in the strangest way and she said no more . No , she went slowly back to the house , and from that day on her life narrowed itself yet more , and what time she did not spend in caring for the two children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nuns who came to visit her , and she besought them now to come every day . Yes , even in the morning , when it is ill luck to see a nun , and many will spit upon a nun if she cross their path before noon , because it is so ill an omen , Pear Blossom welcomed them always . Eagerly she foreswore eating any more meat her life long , and it was not hard for her , either , because she had always shrunk so from taking any life at all . Yes , she was such an one that even on a hot summer 's night she would close the lattices so that the moths would not fly in and burn themselves in the candle flames , and this she counted as the savingof life . Her greatest prayer was that the fool might die before her so that she need never use the packet of white poison that Wang Lung had left to her to use if she must . She learned of these nuns and far into the night she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little rosary of ails of fragrant wood . This was all her life . Now after the trusty man had gone , Wang the Merchant and Wang landlord consulted together as to whether they ought or not to go their brother 's wedding . " They each longed to share such success as he had , but the trusty man had made much of the need for haste lest a tic be made by those above , and so the brothers were afraid , also , beliethey did not know how strong Wang the Tiger was and whether , he lost , he would be heavily punished and they perhaps entangled in punishment because they were his brothers . Wang the Landlord gcd especially to go and see what sort of a woman his younger ther had , for the trusty man told enough to whet his interest . But en his lady heard of the affair she said gravely , " 1t is a very strange and unusual thing to have such a brawl as wec heard . No , if he is punished by those above him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have often heard it told that if a manmits a crime of rebellion against the state , his family may be killed n to the very ninth-removed cousin . " It was true that in the past such punishments were made , when kingsand emperors strove to sweep the country clean of crimes , and Wang he Landlord had seen such things told in plays and he had heard of them in story tellers ' booths , where he loved to pass time away , so that i w , although he was too high for such low pastimes and dared not ) uin a common crowd in such a place , he still listened eagerly if a passngstory teller came into the tea house to tell his tale . Now , remembering , lie turned yellow with fright and he went to Wang the Merchant and said , " We had better have some sort of a signed paper saying our brother was an unfilial son so that we have cast him out of our house , so that if he fails in a battle or is punished we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons . " And he thought to himself at that moment that he was glad his son had not wanted to go , after all , and he took pleasure in pitying his brother and saying , " I.do feel for you with your own son in such a danger ! " - Now although Wang the Merchant merely smiled , yet when he had thought awhile it seemed to him a good , cautious thing to do . So he wrote a paper saying how and in what ways Wang the Third , nicknamedthe Tiger , had been unfilial and no longer belonged to the house , and he had his elder brother sign it first and then he signed it and he took it to the magistrate 's court and paid a sum of money to have it secretly stamped . Then he took the deed and put it safely away where none might find it unless he needed it . Thus the two brothers felt safe , and they looked at each other when they met in the tea house one morning , and Wang the Landlord said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , seeing we are safe ? " But before they could consider it , for they were not men who at their age could take a journey easily , there came a rumor over that whole region , told from mouth to mouth , and it was that the ruler of the province had heard with great wrath that some small country upstart , half robber , half runaway soldier from an old southern general , had seized the seat of government in one of the counties , and an army was to be sent against him to capture him . This ruler was responsible to those yet higher than he , and if he did not manage this affair he would be blamed . When this rumor came filtering through from wayside inn and tea house , and be sure there were those who ran with pleasure to tell it to the two brothers , then Wang the Landlord and Wang the Merchant gave up their plan speedily , and each stayed close in his house for a time , and each was glad he had not boasted too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was a comfort to them to think of the paper , signed and stamped at court . If anyone spoke of their third brother before them Wang the Landlord said loudly , " He has been wild and runaway all his days ! " And Wang the Merchant drew his meager lips together and said , " Let him do what he likes , for it does not concern us and he is scarcely our brother . " Wang the Tiger was in the midst of his wedding feast when this rumor reached him also , and in the midst of three days of mighty feastingthroughout the courts . He had ordered the killing of cows and pigs and fowls , and he ordered everything to be paid for as it was taken to be killed . Although he was so strong in this region now that he could have taken what he liked without price and none would have dared to withstand him , yet because he was a just man he paid for all . This justice moved the common people toward him very much so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to man , " There could be far worse than this lord of war who rules over us . He is strong enough to keep robbers away and he does not rob us himself , beyond the taxes , and I do not see that we could ask for more than this under heaven . " But still at this time they did not come out too openly for him yet , because they had heard the rumor also , and they waited to see if he could be victorious or not , for if he lost they would be blamed if they had showed loyalty to him . But if he gained then they could take courage to come out for him . Still they had let Wang the Tiger take what he needed for the feast , although it taxed the people much to feed so many at a time , and hep167would have the best for once , and he had better than the best even for himself and his bride and his trusty men and the women who cared for the bride . These women were some half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gaoler and of such harmless persons who do not care who is over them and they . came creeping back to their places the next day after the overthrow , ready to swear loyalty to anyone who fed them . And Wang , the Tiger would have these women properly about his bride , for he was very careful toward her and did not go near her for the days before he married her ; no , although he could not sleep at times in the night for thinking of her and wondering who she was and burning for her . But stronger than this was the feeling he had for her to make her the mother of his son , and it seemed to him it was his duty to his son to be careful in all he did . Different indeed was she from Pear Blossom , and because of that early image of a woman set into his memory he had always thought , if he thought , that he would like mild , pale women best . But now he did not care , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was nor what , so that he had her and had her sealed to him forever through their son . During those days no one came near him for anything , for his trusty men saw that he was wholly given over to his desire . But they consultedtogether secretly , for they had heard the rumor and they put their strength to hastening the wedding , so that it could be over and their leader slaked and ready to be himself and lead them on when the need came . More quickly , then , than Wang the Tiger even could hope , the feasts were prepared and the wife of the gaol keeper stood for the woman and the courts were thrown open to all such as cared to come and see and feast . But few men of the city came and fewer women , because they were afraid . Only-the homeless ones and such as live nowhere and have nothing to lose came in as any may come in to a marriage and ate heartily and stared their fill at the strange bride . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to a seat of honor on such a ( lay , as Wang the Tiger had commanded should be done , he sent out word that he grieved he could not come for he had a flux and could not rise from his bed . As for Wang the Tiger , throughout the day of his wedding he moved in a dream and he scarcely knew what he did except that the hours of the day moved so slowly that he did not know what to do with himself . It seemed to him that every breath he drew lasted an hour and that the sun would never crawl up the sky to noon , and when it had , that it would stay forever . He could not be merry as men are at their weddings , for he had never been merry , and now he sat as silent as ever , and there was not one to joke at his expense . He thirsted ex- ceedingly all that day , and he drank much wine , but he could eat nothing , for he was as full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the courts of feasting men and women and the crowds of poor and ragged and the dogs from the streets came in by scores to feast and to eat and to ' pick the bones that were left , and in his own room Wang the Tiger sat silent and half smiling as in a dream and so the day wore on at last to night . Then when the women had prepared the bride for the bed he went into her room and she was there . It was the first woman he had ever known . Yes , this was a curious , unheard-of thing , that a man could come to be more than thirty years old and be a soldier and a runaway from his father 's house since he was eighteen , and never had he gone near a woman , so sealed his heart had been . But that fountain was flowing free , now , and naught could ever seal it again , and seeing this woman sitting there on the bed , he drew his breath in sharply , and she hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he went to her and he found her silent but passionate and frank upon her marriage bed , and he loved her mightily from that hour , and since he had known no other , she seemed to him faultless . Once in the middle of the night he turned to her and he said in a husky whisper , " I do not even know who you are . " And she answered calmly , " What does it matter except that I am here ? But some time I will tell you . " And he let it pass , content for the time , for they were neither of them usual folk , and both their lives were not such as are commonly lived . But the trusty men did not let Wang the Tiger have more than the night , and the next morning at dawn they waited for him , and they saw him come out of his door , calm and refreshed from his marriage chamber . Then the harelipped man said , bowing , " Sir , and honored , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy , but we have heard rumors from the north and the provincial ruler has heard that you have seized the government and comes down against you . " And the Hawk said in his turn , " I heard it from a beggar who came from that way and he said he passed ten thousand men upon the way marching down upon us . " And the Pig Butcher added his tale , stammering through his thick lips in his haste to speak as he had been told , " II also heard itwhen I went out to the market to see how they stick their pigs in this city and a butcher told me . " But Wang the Tiger was all softened and at ease and for the first Now here was a strange thing . These two , a man and a woman , could sit and talk of something far from love and yet Wang the Tiger was as knit to her as he had been in the night . He was amazed that a woman could talk like this for he had never talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tall bodies , and one reason why he feared them was because he did not know what they knew nor what to say to them . He was so made that even with a woman paid for he could not rush to her as a common soldier does , and half his diffidence with women was because he feared the speech he must make with them . But here he sat and talked with this woman as easily as though she were a man and he listened to her when she said on , " You have fewer men than the provincial army has , and when a warriorfinds his army smaller than his enemy 's then he must use guile . " At this he made his silent laugh and said in his gruff way , " Well I know that , or I would not have had you for mine now . " She dropped her eyes quickly at this as though to veil something that might show itself in them and she bit the edge of her lower lip and she answered , " The simplest guile is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . The same simple guile will not do now . " Then Wang the Tiger answered with pride , " I will pit my men against thrice their number of state soldiers . I have trained them and taught them this whole winter and hardened them with boxing and running and fencing and with all feints of war and none of them is afraid to die . Moreover , it is known what state soldiers are , and they will always turn to the strongest side , and doubtless the soldiers of this province are not better paid than any others like them . " Then she said with some impatience , and she drew her sleeve out of , his fingers as she spoke , " Still you have no plan ! Hear meI have a plan made while we talked . There is the old magistrate you have guarded in his court . Use him as a hostage of a kind . " Now she spoke so earnestly and soberly that Wang the Tiger listened to her , yet was amazed that he did , for he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking himself sufficient for anything . But he listened and she said , " Take your soldiers out and take him also and force him and tell him what he is to say , that he shall say what you command . Let him go out to meet the provincial general with a trusty man on either side of him who will hear what he says , and if he does not say what you have told him , let them have their swords ready and plunge them into his bowels , and that shall be a sign for battle . But he has a gall no larger than a hen 's . He will say what he is told , and let him say that nothing has been done without his consent , that the rumor of a rebellion is onlyP171because his own old general rebelled and if it had not been for you who livered him the seals of state would have been stolen and his own gone . " Now this seemed excellent good guile to Wang the Tiger , and hecited with his eyes fastened on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him and he rose and laughed noiselessly tonk what she was and he went out to do what she had said , and sheme close behind him . He commanded a trusty man to go and fetchold magistrate out and bring him to the hall of audience . Then theman had a fancy and it was that they would go and sit in the audi- room , he and she together , and let the old magistrate come beforem , and Wang the Tiger was willing because they must frighten theman thoroughly . So they sat themselves down on the dais , Wang Tiger in a carven chair , and the woman beside him in another chair . Soon the old magistrate came tottering in between two soldiers , andcame out trembling and his robe thrown about him anyhow . Helooked half dazed about the hall , and he saw not one face he knew . No , even those servants of his who had returned looked away when heme in and found this excuse and that to go away on some other busiss . There were only the faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man had his gun and every man was loyal to Wang theiger . Then he looked up , his old lips trembling and blue , his mouth open , and he peered up and there sat Wang the Tiger with his two brows drawn down , fierce and murderous to see , and beside him a strange woman whom the old magistrate had never seen or heard of and he could not think where such an one as she had come from . He stood trembling and timid and ready to die because such an end to his life had come to him as this , who was a man of peace and had been a Confucian scholar in his day . Then Wang the Tiger shouted in his rough and bitter way , with little courtesy , " You are in my hand now and you must follow my commands if you would live on here ! We march against the army of the province tomorrow , and you are to go with us , and when we meet the army you are to go first with my two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell him that you have chosen me your lord of war and that I saved you from a rebellion in your own courts and I stay here by your choice . My two trusty men will be there to hear all you say ; if one word goes wrong it is your end and your last word . But if you speak well and as I tell you , you may return here and you may take your old place again upon this dais , and I will save your face for you and it need not be known whose is the power here in these courts , for I have no mind to be a petty magistrate , nor will I have another here in your place , so long as you do what I command . " pI72 What then could'the weak old man do but give his promise and he said , groaning , " I am caught on the end of your spear . Let it be as you say . I am an old man and I have no son , and what does my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went away shuffling and groaning as he went to his court where his old wife was , who never came out at all . It was true he had no sons , for the two children she had given him died before they could speak . Now whether the thing could have been done as Wang the Tiger planned or not none knows , but again his destiny helped him . It was now full spring and over the land the willows budded again and the peach trees burst into swift bloom , and while farmers stripped off their winter coats and worked bare backed in the fields again , rejoicing in the mild winds and the warm gentle sun upon their clogged flesh , the lords of war awoke also , and the restlessness of spring filled the countryside . And the lords of war awoke quarrelsome and full of lust of war against each other and old troubles were burnished and made new and old differences sharpened , and every man grew ambitious to achieve some new place for himself while the fresh spring lasted . Now the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of a weak , unready man , and there were many lords of war who cast longing eyes at that seat and thought how easy it would be to seize it . Many counted over such as stood in the way and some banded together and consulted as to how they could take the power of the nationand unseat this unstable and ignorant man whom-others had put there , and how they could place their own choice there to serve their own purpose . Among these lords of war Wang the Tiger was still one of the very least and he was scarcely known among the great ones except as when men of battle gossip among themselves at some meeting or feast , and one might say , " Did you hear of the captain who split himself off from his old general and has set himself up in such and such a province ? He is a good brave , it is said , and he is called the Tiger because of his angers and fierceness and his two black brows . " Thus the chief lord of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard of him and he had heard how Wang the Tiger had routed the Leopard and had approved the deed . Now this chief lord was one of the great lords of war of the nation and he was one of those who had it in his mind to unseat the weak ruler if he could , and if he could not put himself on the seat at least to put his man there , so that the revenues of the nation would come to his own hands . During this spring , therefore , when restlessness rose everywhere , P173range flowers of ambitions blossomed . There were proclamations pasted on city gates and on walls and all such places where people pass , and these proclamations were sent out by the lord of war of that proince . He said that since the ruler was so evil and the people greatly Tressed , he could not endure such crimes as these before heaven . Aloughhe was weak and witless , yet must he come forth to save the ople . Having so written , he prepared for war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either read or write , they ' d not know this their savior , but they groaned aloud because fresh xcs were put upon their lands and upon their harvests and upon their its and in the towns upon shops and goods . If they groaned aloud or complained , there were those minions of the lord of war who heard hem and cried out , " How ungrateful a people are you , who will not pay even for your own salvation ! And who else should pay for the soldiers who are to fight for you and make you safe ? " So the people paid what they must , however unwillingly , fearing if they did not either the wrath of the lord they had or of a new lord who might come in and conquer them and devour them afresh ; being rapacious with his victory . Having determined on this war , therefore , the lord of the province was eager to marshal to him every small captain and general , so when he heard of the rebellion Wang the Tiger had made , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bear too heavily down upon that little new general whose name is Wang the Tiger , because I hear he is a good angry fierce fellow and I want such as he is under my ensign . This whole nation will divide itself , , perhaps this spring , and if not this year then next or next , and the lords of the north will declare against the lords of the south . Let this man be treated gently then . " Now although it is said that lords of war should be subservient in a nation to the civil governors of the people , it is a thing known and proved that the power goes always to the armed man and the man with weapons , and how can a weaponless man , even though he has the right , oppose a man of war in the same region with him , who has soldiers to his command ? Thus it was that destiny helped Wang the Tiger in that spring . For when the armies of state came marching against him , Wang the Tiger led his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sedan and he ambushed many good strong men near in case of treachery . When they came to a meeting place the old magistrate came out of his sedan and stumbling through the dust of the country road , he went , dressed in his magistrate 's robes , and leaning upon the two trusty men . ThepI74 general who had been sent from the state came to meet him , and after the rites of courtesy had been observed , the old man said in his falteringway , " You have it wrongly , my lord . This Wang the Tiger is no robber but my own captain and my new young general who protects my court and he saved me from a rebellion in my own retinue . " Now although the general did not believe this , having heard the truth from his spies , and although no one believed it , still he had his orders that Wang the Tiger was not to be offended and that he was not to lose a man in a brawl so little as this when every gun was needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old magistrate said , therefore , he only rebuked him slightly saying , " You should have sent word of this before because we have been at an expense to bring men to punish what I thought was a rebel . There shall be a fine imposed on you to pay for the expense of an idle errand and it is ten thousand pieces of silver . " When Wang the Tiger heard that this was all he exulted very much and he led his men back in triumph again . And he imposed in his turn a tax beyond what was usual upon all the salt in that place and in less than twice thirty days he had the ten thousand pieces and some over , for that place had much salt and it was even sent out to other places and some said to other countries , too . When this was over Wang the Tiger was more strong than ever in his power and he had not lost a man , either . It seemed to him that for this honor was due to his woman and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know who or what she was . Passion was still his chief pastime with her , but he wondered sometimes what her story was . Yet if he asked her she always put him off , saying , " It is a long tale , and I will tell you some day in a winter when there can be no war . But now it is spring and time for battle and for enlarging yourself , and not for idle talk . " And she put him off restlessly , her eyes bright and hard . Then Wang the Tiger knew the woman was right , for over all the country the news came winged that there was to be such a war that spring among the lords of war as had not been in ten years of wars , and the people were dismayed , not knowing from what point the war would strike them , hearing of it coming here or coming there . Yet there was the land to till and they tilled it , and in the cities the merchantshad their shops and men must live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their lives , and if they groaned at a coming terror , they did their work while they waited to see what would happen to them . In his region all the eyes of the people were turned to Wang the Tiger , for his rule over them was now open and established and theyP175knew the taxes went through his hands . Although the old magistrate was still there for a show of state , he was an old image and everything was decided by Wang the Tiger . Yes , Wang the Tiger even sat at the magistrate 's right hand in the audience hall , and the old magistrate looked to him when the judgment moment came , and the money that used to be paid to the councillors now went into Wang the Tiger'snd and to his trusty men . But Wang the Tiger was still himself , forhe took from the rich , if a poor man came and he knew it , he wouldhim speak for himself freely . There were many poor who praised 'm . But all the people turned to Wang the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they knew if he joined in the great war theyust pay the soldiers he would need and buy his guns . As for Wang the Tiger , he had considered the matter well , alone and ith his woman and also with his trusty men , but he was still puzzled to what was best for him . The lord of war of the province had sent t commands to every little separate general and captain and small rd of war and said , " Follow under my ensign with your men , for now is the hour when Ive can all rise up a step or two in the tide of war . " But Wang the Tiger did not know whether to come at his call or not , because he could not see which side would win . If he cast in his name with the losing side he would set himself back and perhaps ruin himself , seeing he was so newly risen up . So he took thought for himself and he thought and he sent out his spies to see and to hear and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he said while they were out he would delay and declare himself for no one , and he would wait until the war was fought nearly to an end and the victory plain and then he would make haste to declare himself , and so on the last swelling wave he might ride with others to its crest ' and not lose a man or a gun , either . He sent out his spies , then , and waited . In the night he talked about it with his woman , for their love and his ambition were linked in the strangest way , and when he had slaked his thirst and lay at his ease he talked with her as he had never done to anyone in his life . He poured out to her every plan he had and he ended every dream with this saying , " Thus will I do , and when you give me a son , he will be the meaning for it all . " But she never answered this hope of his and when he pressed on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again she said , " Have you your plans ready and made for the last battle ? " and she said often , " Guile is the best warfare , and the best battle is the one at the end when victory is sure and swift . "   And Wang the Tiger never noticed any coldness in her at all , he was so hot himself . All through that spring he waited therefore , although waiting chafed him in usual times , and he could never have borne it now if he had not had this woman new to him and there at his hand . Summer came on and the wheat was cut and all through the valleys the sound of the flails beat all day into the still , hot sunshine . In the fields where the wheat had stood the sorghum cane grew tall and rank and put forth its tassels and while Wang the Tiger waited , wars sprang up everywhere , and this general and that in the south banded together for the moment like generals of the north , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generals of the south would not win , for it went against some gorge in him to link himself ever again with those little dark and stunted men . It went against him so much that he brooded sometimes , and said to himself sullenly that if the south won he would go and hide in his mountains for a while and wait for a new turn of war . But he did not wait in complete idleness . He trained his men with fresh zeal and he enlarged his army once more , and enrolled in it many ' good young fellows who came to him and over the new ones he set the old and other soldiers , and his army swelled to ten thousand men , and to pay for this he added somewhat to his taxes on wine and on salt and on travelling merchants . His only trouble at this time was that he had not enough guns , and he saw he must do one of two things ; either he must get guns by guile , or he must conquer some little near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was because guns were very hard to find , being foreign things and brought in from foreign parts , and Wang the Tiger had not thought of this when he had chosen his region an inland region , and he had no coastal port he controlled , and other ports were guarded so that he could not hope to smuggle guns through them . Moreover , he knew no foreign tongue , nor had he any near him who did , and so he had no way yet to deal with the foreign merchants , and so it seemed to him that after all he must have a little battle somewhere , for many of his men were without guns . One night he told this to his woman , and she took a sudden interest and put her mind to it , for often she could be listless and paid no heed to him at all . Now when she put her mind to it she said very soon , " But I thought you said you had a brother who is a merchant ! " " I do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering , " but he is a grain merchant and not a merchant for guns . " - " Yes , but you see nothing ! " she cried at him , in the impatient , high way she had . " If he is a merchant and deals with sea coasts , he can buy guns and smuggle them in his goods somehow . I do not know how , but there must be a way . " P177Now Wang the Tiger thought this over awhile and again it seemed to him this was the cleverest woman , and he made a plan on what she had said . The next day he called his pocked nephew to him , grown tall in this past year , and he kept the youth by him continually for small special things he needed to have done , and he said , " Go to your father and pretend you are home for a visit and nothing more but when you are alone with him tell him I need three thousand guns and I am hampered sorely because I have not them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are useless to me without each man his gun . Tell him he is a merchant and one who deals with the sea coast and he can think of a way for me . I send you , because the thing must be kept secret , and you are my own blood . " The youth was glad enough to go , and he promised secrecy eagerly , and he was proud with his mission . And again Wang the Tiger waited , but he still received men under his ensign , only he chose his men carefullyand tested each as to whether or not he feared to die . THE lad went winding his way homeward , then , over the countryside . He had taken off his soldier 's garb and had put on the clothing of a farmer 's son and with these coarse blue garments and his face brown and pocked he looked nothing but a country lad , and fit grandson for Wang Lung . He rode upon his old white ass , with a ragged coat folded under him for a saddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare feet to hasten it sometimes . No one who saw him riding thus and often half asleep under the hot sun of summer would have dreamed that he carried a message that was to bring three thousand guns into that peaceful country . But when he did not sleep he sang his song of soldiers and war , for he loved to sing , and when he did this a farmer would look up at him uneasily from his work in the fields and stare after the youth , and once a farmer shouted after him , " A curse on you to be singing a soldier 's dittydo you want to bring the black crows around us again ? " But the youth was gay and careless and he spat here and there in the dust of the road to show how careless he was , and to show he would go on singing if he wished to sing . The truth was he did not know any other songs than these , having been so long among reckless and fightingmen , and it can not be expected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their quiet fields . On the third day at noon he came to his home and as he slid off his ass at the place where the side street parted from the main street , there was his eldest cousin lounging along and he stared and stopped in a yawn he was making and said , in greeting , " Well , and are you a general yet ? " Then the pocked lad called back quietly and wittily , " No , but I have taken at least the first degree ! " This he said to mock his cousin a little because everyone knew how Wang the Landlord and his lady had always talked a great deal of how they would make a scholar of this son and how next season he was to go up for examination at such and such a seat of learning and so become a great man . But the season went and the year passed into another , and he never went . Now the pocked youth knew this cousin of his was on his way not to any school but to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed , and languid after the night he had had somewhere . But the son of Wang the Landlord was dainty and scornful and he surveyed his cousin and said , " At least being a first degree general has not put a silk coat on your back ! " And he walked on without waiting to hear any answer , swaying himself as he walked so that his own silk robes , the color of the green of a willow tree newly leaved , swayed also with his lordly steps . But the pocked youth grinned and stuck his tongue out toward his cousin 's back , and went to his own door . When he stepped into the court of his own home all was as it ever was . It was time for the noon meal , and the door was open into the house and he saw his father sitting down alone to the table to eat and the children ran anywhere and ate as they always did , and his mother stood at the door with her bowl to her lips and her chopsticks pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chattered to a neighborwoman , who had come in to borrow something , about a salt fish that a cat had stolen the night before , although it was hung high on a beam , too . When she saw the son she shouted at him , " Well , you are back in time to eat , and you could not have struck it better ! " and she went on with her chatter . The youth grinned at her but he said nothing except to call her name out , and he went inside and his father nodded to him , a little surprised , and the son called his name dutifully and then went and found himself a bowl and a pair of chopsticks and filled his bowl from the food on the table and then went to one side and sat down edgewise on his seat as sons should do if they sit in the presence of those above them . When they had eaten , the father poured a little tea into his rice bowl , but sparingly , for he was sparing in all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meager sips , and then he said to his son , " Do you bring any word ? " P179And the son said , " Yes , I do , but I can not tell you here . " This he said because his brothers and sisters crowded around him and stared at him silently , since he was strange to them , and they listened eagerly for any word he might say . By now the mother was back also to fill her bowl again , for she was a very hearty one to eat and ate a long time after her husband was finished and gone , and she stared too at her son and said , " You have grown a good ten inches , I swear ! And why have you a ragged coat like that on ? Does your uncle give you no better ? What do they feed you to make you grow like thatgood meat and wine , I swear ! " And the lad grinned again and said , " I have good clothes but I did not wear them this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang the Merchant was aghast and he cried with unwonted Interest , " Whatdoes my brother give his soldiers meat every day ? " The lad hastened to say , " No , but now only because he prepares them for a war and he wants them fierce and full of blood . But I , have meat because I do not live with the common soldiers and I may eat what my uncle and his woman leave in their bowlsI and the trusty men . " At this his mother said avidly , " Tell me about that woman of his ! It was a strange thing he did not ask us to the wedding . " " He did , " said Wang the Merchant hastily , seeing no end to this talk if it began . " Yes , he did ask us , but I said we would not go . It would have cost a pile of silver and you would have wanted new clothes and this and that for a show if you had gone . " To this the woman said with much spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you old miser , I never go anywhere and " But Wang the Merchant cleared his throat and said to his son , " Come with me for there is no peace here , " and he rose and brushed his children aside , but not ungently , and he went out and his son followed him . Wang the Merchant walked ahead of his son down the street to a small tea house where he did not often go , and he chose a table in a quiet corner . But the house was almost empty , for it was an hour when there were not many guests , for farmers had sold their loads and gone home , and city guests had not come in for the afternoon 's talk . There in peace then did Wang the Merchant 's son tell him his mission . Wang the Merchant listened very closely to it all and he said not a word until his son had said his say , and when it was over he did not let his face change . No , where Wang the Landlord would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a thing impossible to do , Wang the Merchant had by now grown so secretly rich that noth- ing was impossible to him and if he ever hesitated , it was to see if the thing would benefit him or not when done . He had his money in all sorts of places and men borrowed of him for everything they could . He had even his money in Buddhist temples , loaned to priests on securityof temple lands , for in these days the people were not devout as they had been , and only women and usually old women , too , were the ones to heed the gods , and many temples grew poor and left off their flourishing estate . And Wang the Merchant had his money in ships upon the rivers and upon the seas , and he had money in a railway , and he had a very good sum in a brothel in the city , although he was never a guest at his own brothel , and his elder brother never dreamed that when he went to play at that great new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was his own brother 's house . But it was a business that brought good return , and Wang the Merchant reckoned on the common nature of men . Thus his money flowed out in a hundred secret channels , and if he had recalled it suddenly , thousands would have suffered . Yet he ate no more than he ever did and no better , and he:did not game as any man will who has more than he can eat and wear , nor did he let his sons wear silk coats , and seeing him and how he lived , none would have dreamed how rich he was . Therefore he could think of three thousand foreign guns and not be astounded as Wang the Landlord would have been . Yes , looking at those two brothers , if one had met them together in the street , one would have said that Wang the Landlord was the very rich one , for he spent his money so easily and he was so monstrous fat and rolling in his silk and satin robes and his furs and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived with Pear Blossom and grew to quiet manhood there beside her , forgotten day after day . So Wang the Merchant pondered for a time in silence , and he said at last , " Did my brother say what security I am to have for so much money as this to buy these guns ? I ought to have good security , seeing that it is against the law to buy them . " And the youth said , " He said , Tell my brother he must take all the land I have left for security if he can not trust my word until I can collectrevenue to pay for them . I have my hand over all revenues in this region , but I can not give out a vast sum at once and not make my men suffer . ' " " I do not want more land , " said Wang the Merchant , reflecting , " and this has been a hard year here , near to famine , and land is cheap . All he has left will not be enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the youth said earnestly , and his little bright black eyes shone in his face he was so earnest , P181at her , it is true my uncle is a very great man . You should see how one fears him ! But he is a good man too , for he does not kill only kill . Even the ruler of the province fears him . He is not afraid of hingno , who but he would have dared to marry a woman whom ybody calls a fox ! And if you give him these guns it will mean e power to him than ever . " ow the words of his own son can not move a father too much , still there was some truth in this and the thing that decided Wang Merchant was that it would pay him well to have a brother who a powerful lord of war . Yes , if the time of a great war came on as was rumored in these years and if the war moved hereand can tell how a war will mov  --  his great possessions might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then perhaps by the less poor . For Wang the Merchant now had his wealth no more in s , and the lands he had were as nothing beside his houses and shops and money-lending business , and such wealth may be taken y so quickly in a time when men are free to despoil , that in a few s a rich man may be made poor if he has no secret power from somewhere to help him and protect him , in a sudden need such as maye at any time . So he thought to himself that these guns might be a protection for m , too , one day , and he thought a while longer of how he could pursethem and how smuggle them in . This he could do , for he now ned two small ships of his own to carry rice to an outer country near . It was against the law to send rice out in this way , and he had to it secretly , but he made a great profit on it and it paid him to give ibes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid , they overlooked is two little ships which he kept small on purpose , and vented theiranger and zeal for law upon foreign ships or again upon some othersthat did not bring them any good . And Wang the Merchant thought of his two ships coming back empty sometimes from that other country or else only half loaded with cotton stuffs and foreign knick-knacks , and he thought he could manageeasily enough to smuggle foreign guns among those wares , and if he were caught he would put money out here and there and he would give his two captains something to close their mouths and make silence worth while for all . Yes , he could do this . Then he said to his son , looking about first to see that none was near , no guest or officious servant , and he spoke through his teeth without moving his lips and very softly , " I can get the guns to the coast and even to a certain point where the railway runs nearest my brother , but how can I get them to him . over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of travel except by foot or beast 's back ? " P182Now Wang the Tiger had not said anything of this to the youth , he could only scratch his head foolishly and stare at his father ii he said , " I must go back and ask him that . " And Wang the Merchant said , " Tell him I will manage to put the guns into goods of another sort and marked with other names and  | them at a point , and then he must get them somehow from there . " So with this the lad went back to his uncle , and he went the very next day . But that night he slept in his own home and his moth cooked him a dish he loved of little steamed loaves of bread with garlic and pork inside , a very dainty dish . He ate himself full of these at what were left he thrust into his bosom to eat on the way . Then scan upon his ass he wound his way back again to Wang the Tiger . THERE happened during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arrogance would not have believed true if had been told . The fever of war spread over that whole regi when it was known that great lords above waged a war and split t country into two parts . In that fever little war-like spirits arose eve where , and men who were idle and without work or those who wou not work and lovers of any adventure and sons who did not love their parents and gamesters who lost in their gambling and every little dii. contented man seized on this time to come out and make a showing of some sort . In this very region where Wang the Tiger now ruled in the name of the old magistrate , these rebellious men joined themselves into bands and they gave themselves the name of The Yellow Turbans , because they wore strips of yellow about their heads , and they began to prey upon the country . At first they did it in small timid ways , exacting from some farmer food as they passed or they went into a village inn and ate and went on without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such fierce looks and raising their voices so high and quarrelsome that the innkeeper was afraid to make an ado and so swallowedhis loss as best he could . But these Yellow Turbans grew bolder as their numbers swelled , and they began to long for ' guns , for their only guns were the few that runaway soldiers among them had . They grew more bold , therefore , in their marauding among the common people , although they still did not come near any large towns or cities , but kept themselves to small villages and hamlets . At last some of the more courageous among the farmers came to Wang the Tiger and told him and they made reportP183how marauders grew bold because they were unchecked andwould come in the night to rob and if they did not find all theythey would kill a household of farming folk and think nothinge deed . But Wang the Tiger did not know whether to believe the or not , for when he sent spies out to ask other farmers , there were ones who were afraid to tell and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time did nothing , thinking lightly of it hell his whole mind was set on the right moment to declare himself the great war. ! tut the time of the great heat of summer came on and many armies marched through to the south and there were some of these soldiers o were lured away to the robber band and the robbers grew greatly numbers and daring . At this season of the year also the sorghum cane grew very high in those parts and it made a very perfect hiding c for robbers and they grew so bold and it came to such a pass that people did not dare to travel off the highway except in a large number et her. ow whether Wang the Tiger would have believed how bad it was not can not be said , for he was somewhat at the mercy of his men he must believe what his spies and his own trusty men thought they overpraised him and made . him think none would dare to stand before him . But one day there came in from the country to theat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hempen bag with m . They would not open this bag for anyone to see , and they said steadfastly to all questions asked them , " This bag is for the general . " And supposing they brought a gift to Wang the Tiger , the guardsthem through the gates and they went to the hall of audience andthere Wang the Tiger sat , for it was the hour when he often did so. en the two brothers came before him they made their obeisances , aid then without a further word they opened the hempen bag and tookFrom it two pairs of hands , one the hands of a very old woman , worn ittl hard with work and the dark skin cracked and dry , and the other the hands of an old man calloused in the palms with the holding of the kindle of a plow . These hands the two brothers held up by the stumps where the blood now was black and dried . Then the elder of the brother% , a very earnest , angry man of middle age , his face square and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our old parents and they lie dead ! Two dayso the robbers marauded in our hamlet and when my old father cried out that he had nothing they cut off his two hands , and when my old mother bravely cursed them they cut off hers also . We two brothers were in the fields but our wives escaped and came screaming to us and we ran back with our forks . But the robbers were gone , for there hadP184Sbeen no great band of them , only eight or ten , and our parents were old . Yet not one in the village dared to lift his hand to help them I they suffer at some later time . Sir , we let you have the revenues a we pay you a heavy tax over and above what we must pay the sta and we pay on land and on salt and on all we buy and sell and we it to be protected from robbers . What will you do ? " And they held up the worn , stiff old hands of their parents . Now Wang the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place wou have done , grow angry at such bold speech . No , he was astounded the tale , and he grew angry , not because the farmers had dared to to him , but that such a thing could be in his regions . He shouted out f his captains and they came in , one by one as they were found here a there , until there were some fifty of them in the hall . Then Wang the Tiger himself picked up the dead hands from wlie they lay helplessly upon the tiled floor and he showed them to all an he said , " These are the hands of good farming folk who were maraud and robbed in the daytime when their sons worked in the fields ! W goes first against these marauders ? " The captains stared and the sight roused them and they were rous to think that robbers dared to rob in lands belonging to them and the muttered together and said here and there , " Shall we let this go on in a land where we have the first right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own lands ? " and they cried out , " Let us go against them ! " Wang the Tiger turned then to the two brothers and he said , " Returnto your homes in peace and confidence . Tomorrow these will go out and I shall not rest until I find out who the head of these robbers is and deal with him as I dealt with the Leopard ! " Then the younger brother spoke , and he said , " Most Gracious , we think there is no head yet and they wander in little bands separate from one another except as their name links them , and they look for one strong man to hold them together . " " If this is so , " said Wang the Tiger , " it will be the easier to scatter them . " " But not to stamp them out , " said the older brother bluntly . Then the two farmer brothers waited on there as though they had more to say and did not know how to say it , and at last after being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , Wang the Tiger perceived they mistrusted him and he grew somewhat angry and said , " Do you doubt that I am strong enough who killed the Leopard , a mighty robber in his day and he lived on you more than twenty years ? " The two brothers looked at each other and the elder one swallowed his spittle and said slowly ,   " Most Gracious , it is not that . But we have something to say to you private . " Wang the Tiger turned to the captains who still stood about and heouted to them to be gone and prepare their men . When they weregone except the one or two whom Wang the Tiger always kept ) ut him , the elder brother fell on his face and he knocked his head three times upon the tiles and he said , " Do not , Most Gracious , be very angry . We are poor men and when ask a favor we can but ask it and we have no money to pay bribes insure it . " And Wang the Tiger said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ask for bribes if you ask a thing I can do . " The man answered humbly , " When we came here today our village rothers tried to hold us back because they said if we brought the soldiers it would be worse than the robbers for they demand so much and we are poor men who must work if we eat . The robbers come and go , but the soldiers live on in our houses and look at our maids and cat what we keep for the winter and we dare not oppose them because they have weapons . Most Gracious , if your soldiers are to come like this , then keep them , and we will suffer what we must . " Now Wang the Tiger was a good than and he was furious when he heard this and he rose and shouted for his captains to come again , and when they came back in twos and threes he roared at them and made his face very black and he drew his brows down at them and he said , " This region I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out and be back the third day and so they shall do ! Every man of mine shall be away no more than three days and if any quarters himself upon the people I will have him killed ! If they overcome the robbers and rout them I will reward them with silver and food and wine but I am no robber chief and I have no robber band ! " And he glared at the captains in so fierce a way that they promised him hastily . Thus Wang the Tiger did , and he sent the brothers away with his promise and they took the hands of their parents and put them reverentlyinto the hempen bag again , so that the old pair might be buried whole and with all their parts , and they returned to their village full of the praises of Wang the Tiger . But when Wang the Tiger had sent the brothers away and took time to think what he had promised , he was in some dismay to find where his kind heart had carried him , and he sat in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose his good men and his guns in a brawl with robbers . He knew , too , that there must be some in his army such as are in every army , who are idle and looking for a better place , and these might even be enticed away to the robbers and take their guns with them . So he sat there brooding and thinking he had been too hasty and too moved by the token the brothers brought . And as he sat there , a messenger came with a letter and it was from his brother , Wang the Merchant . Wang the Tiger tore the end and took the letter out and read it and there in devious , winding worth , his brother told him that the guns were come and would be left at a certain place on a certain day , and they were hidden in bags of grain brought for making flour in the great northern mills . Now Wang the Tiger was in as great a puzzle as he ever had been for he had to fetch the guns somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbers . He sat awhile and cursed the day to himself , and as he sat the woman he loved came in . She was unusuallygentle and languid as she walked , for it was the middle day of the great heat of summer , and she wore only a white silk coat and trousers , and she had unbuttoned the collar of her coat at the throat , so that her neck showed out , very soft and full and paler than her face . Now Wang the Tiger for all his cursing and trouble saw her and he was caught and held at the sight of her pretty throat and he held his trouble back for an instant and he longed to lay his fingers there upon her pale neck , and he waited until she came near . She did come near and leaned upon the table and she said to him , looking at the letter he still held , " Is there anything wrong with you that you look so black and angry ? " Then she waited and laughed a little , a small high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not I , for I would be afraid you might kill me with such black looks as you have now ! " Wang the Tiger held the letter out to her saying nothing , but his eyes fixed upon her bare throat and upon the smoothness of the turn it made into her bosom . He had come to such a pass with this woman that even in this short time he told her everything . She took the letter and read it , and he could take thought to be proud that she could read and he deemed her beautiful beyond anything as she bent over the letter , her thin , sharply marked lips moving a little as she read . Her hair war . smooth now and oiled and knotted at her neck into a little net of black silk thread , and in her ears were hung gold rings . She read the letter and then put it into its envelope again , and laid it on the edge of the table , and Wang the Tiger watched her quick light hands , thin and quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do not know how to get those bags of grain . I must get them by some guile or force . " " That is not hard , " said the woman smoothly . " Guile and force are easy . I have a plan already in my head , made as I read the letter . You need only to send a band of your men as though they were robbers , the robbers that men tell of now-a-days , and let them seem to rob the grainP187themselves , and who will know you have anything to do with it ? " Wang the Tiger laughed his noiseless laugh when she said this ac it seemed to him so wise a plan and he drew her to him , for he alone in the room and the guards went outside the door whenever slue , and he satisfied himself with his hard hands on her soft flesh , be said , there has never been a woman so wise as you ! When I killed the rd that day how I blessed myself in that deed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and called for the k and he said , e guns we need are at a place about thirty miles from here , where two railroads cross , and they are in bags of grain as though to behipped there to the northern mills . But take five hundred men arm yourselves and dress yourselves like some breed of robbers go there and seize those bags and seem to carry them away to a . But have carts and asses ready at a near place and bring the bags , grain and all . " ow the Hawk was a clever man and he trusted to his wits and to , whereas the Pig Butcher trusted to his two great fists that were large as earthen bowls , and a wily deed like this pleased him , and he bowed . Then Wang the Tiger said further , When all the guns are here , be sure I shall reward you and every soldier shall have a reward measured to what he has done . " Then when this was done Wang the Tiger went back into his room . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armchair of carved wood , Which had a woven reed seat for coolness , and he unfastened his girdlehis coat at the throat , for the day grew to a monstrous heat , andsat and rested himself and thought of her throat and the turn itde into her bosom and he marvelled that flesh could be so soft ashers , and how skin could be so smooth . Not once did he note that the letter his brother had written was gone , r the woman had taken it and thrust it deep into the bosom of her lobe , where not even his hands had reached it . Now when the Hawk had been gone for a half a day Wang the Tiger walked alone in the cool of the night before he went in to sleep , and he walked in the court near a side gate that was open to the street , a small street where few people passed , and those only by day . Andhe walked he heard a cricket cheep . At first he paid no heed to it , because he had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at last he heard it and it came to him that this was not the time of the year for a cricket and so out of idle curiosity he looked to see where It was hid . It came from the gate and as he looked out into the gatheringdusk he saw someone crouched and shapeless by the gate . He put his hand to his sword and stepped forward and there in the gatheringP188dusk he saw his nephew 's pocked face turned palely toward him and the lad whispered breathlessly , " No sound , my uncle ! Do not tell your lady I am here . But come into the street when you can and I will wait for you at the first forks . I have something to tell you and it must not wait . " The youth was off like a shadow then , but Wang the Tiger would not wait , since he was alone , and he went after the shadow , and came first to the spot . Then he saw his nephew come sliding along in the darkness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ails you that you come creeping along like a beaten dog ? " And the youth whispered , " HushI have been sent to a place far from hereif your lady saw me here and she is such a clever one I do not know who she has watching meshe said she would kill me if I told , and it is not the first time she has threatened me ! " When Wang the Tiger heard this he was too astonished to speak . He lifted the lad half off his feet and dragged him into the , darkness of an alley and he commanded him to speak . Then the lad put his mouth to Wang the Tiger 's ear and he said , " Your woman sent me with this letter to someone , but I do not know to whom , for I have not torn it open . She asked me if I could read and I said no , how could I , being country bred , and she gave me this letter , then , and told me to give it to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the north suburb tonight and she gave me a piece of silver for it . " He thrust his hand into his bosom and brought out a letter and Wang the Tiger seized it without a word . Without a word he strode through the alley to a small street where an old man opened a little solitary shop to sell hot water , and there , by the flickering light of the small bean oil lamp that was hung upon a nail on the wall , Wang the Tiger tore open the letter and read it . And as he read he saw plainly there was a plot . Shehis womanhad told someone of his guns ! Yes , he could see she had met someone and told him , and here in the letter she laid a last command . She wrote , " When you have the guns and are gathered , I will come . " Now when Wang the Tiger read this it was as though the earth he stood upon whirled out from under his feet , and as though the heavens came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartily and so well that he never dreamed she could betray him . He had forgot every warning his trusty harelipped man gave him , and he never saw the man 's downcast looks these days , and he loved the woman to such a point that he longed exceedingly for but one more thing , and it was that she would give him a son . Yes , he asked her again and again and with what ardor , every time , whether she had conceived or not . He had so loved her he did not dream she could withstand him in herP189heart . At this very hour he had been waiting , even , to go to his love ; siting for the night . Now he saw she had never loved him . She could plot like this at the very hour when he waited for the turn of war and his own great step forward . She could plot like this and lie all night in his bed and pretendsorrow when he asked concerning his son . He was suddenly so angry he could not draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacker than he had ever known it to come . His heart beat and roared in his ears , his eyes blurred , and his brows knitted themselves until they pained him . His nephew had followed him and stood in the shadow by the door . But Wang the Tiger flung him aside , without a word , and never seeing that in the strength of his anger he threw the lad down cruelly ii1 on the sharp stones of the road . He strode back to his courts on the wings of his anger and as he went he took his sword out of its sheath , the Leopard 's fine steel sword , and he wiped it upon his thigh as he walked . He went straight into the room where the woman lay in her bed , and she had not drawn the curtain because of the heat . There she lay , and the full moon of that night had risen over the wall of the court and its light fell upon her as she lay upon the bed . She lay naked for coolness and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open upon the edge of the bed . But Wang the Tiger did not wait . Although he saw how fair she was and fair as an image of alabaster in the moonlight , and underneath his rage he knew there was a pain in him worse than death , he did not stay . For the moment he remembered wilfully how she had tricked him and how she would have betrayed him , and in this strength he lifted up his sword and he drove it down smoothly and cleanly into her throat , upturned as her head hung over her pillow . He twisted it sharply once , and then he brought it out and wiped it on the silken coverlid . There came a single sound from her lips but the blood choked it so he did not know what she said and she did not move except that the instant his sword was in her throat , her arms and legs flew up and her eyes burst open . Then she died . But Wang the Tiger would not stop to think what he had done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , and his men came running , and he threw his commands at them harsh and sure in his anger . He had to go now without a moment 's delay to the succor . of the Hawk and see if he could not reach the guns before the robbers did . All his men left he took with him except two hundred whom he left under the captaincy of his harelipped man and he led the others out himself .   As he passed through the gate he saw the old man who watched there come out of his bed yawning and dazed at all the sudden commotion and Wang the Tiger shouted at him as he rode by on his horse , " There is something in my room where I sleep ! Go and carry it out and fling it into a canal or some pond ! See to it before I return ! " And Wang the Tiger rode on very high and proud and nursing his anger . But inside his breast it was as though his heart dripped blood secretly into his vitals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , his heart dripped steadily and secretly within . And he groaned restlessly of a sudden , although none heard it in the dull thudding of horses ' feet upon the dusty road . Neither did Wang the Tiger himself know that he groaned over and over again . All over that countryside did Wang the Tiger roam with his men that night and the next day , seeking the Hawk , and the sun beat down upon them for the day came windless . But Wang the Tiger would not let his men rest because he had that within himself which could not rest and toward the evening upon the highway that ran north and south he met the Hawk at the head of his band of walking soldiers . At first Wang the Tiger could not be sure if these were his own men for the Hawk had done what he had been told to do , and he had told his men to wear their ragged inner garments and tie a towel about their heads and Wang the Tiger had need to wait until they came near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tiger saw these were indeed his own men . He dismounted then from his red horse and sat down under a date tree that was there beside the road , for he was exceedingly spent from within , and he waited for the Hawk to come near . The more he waited the more afraid he grew that his anger might die down , and he forced himself to remember , with a furious pain , how he had been deceived . But the secret of his pain and anger was that although the woman was dead , yet he still loved her ; although he was glad he had killed her , yet he longed for her with passion . This angry pain made him very surly and when the Hawk was come Wang the Tiger growled at him , scarcely lifting his eyes , and his eyes nearly hidden under his brows , " Well , I will swear you have not the guns ! " But the Hawk had a voluble good tongue of his own in that peaked face of his and he had a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he answered with heat , and without any courteous words , " How did I know the robbers would have been told of the guns ? P191y had been told by some spy or other and they went before us. can I help it if they were told before you told me ? " And as he c he threw his gun upon the ground and folded his arms on his nn and he stared mutinously at his , general , to show he would notput clown . ' licit Wang the Tiger , seeing justice still , rose wearily from the where he sat and he stood under the date tree and leaned against rough trunk , and he unbuckled his belt and drew it more tightly ut him before he spoke . But at last he said wearily and with a great crness , " l suppose all my good guns are gone , then . I shall have to fight thers for them . Well , if we must fight we will ! " He shook himself patiently and spat and roused himself and went on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on them , and if half of you dead after the fray , why , then you are dead and I can not help it ! y guns I must have and if a gun costs me ten men or so , why , I will and ten men more for every gun and the gun is worth it ! " Then he mounted his horse again and held the beast hard when it danced to and fro with impatience that it was taken from the succu- ! cut grass that was there , and the Hawk stood there moodily watching and at last he said , " I know well enough where the robbers are . They are gathering togctherin the old lair and I can swear they have the guns with them . Who their leader is I do not know , but they have been busy for a few plays now , and have given the countryside peace while they gathered together , as though they were ready to choose a leader . " Now Wang the Tiger knew well who their leader was to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders to march against that ! air and he said , " We will go there and you are to fire at them . When the firing is over , I will parley and every man who brings a gun may join my ranks . For every gun you see and pick up and bring to me you shall have a piece of silver . " And so saying , he mounted his horse once more . Once more Wang the Tiger rode over the winding valley paths and over the low foothills until he came to the double-crested mountain , and his men came raggedly behind him . The farming folk looked up from their fields and wondered and the soldiers shouted , " We go against the robbers ! " To this sometimes farmers made answer back heartily ; " A good deed ! " But more there were who said nothing and they looked sourly at the soldiers as they tramped into their fields of grain and cabbages and melons , because they did not believe that any good could come of soldiers , they were so weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascend the foothills and at the bass of the double-crested mountain where the pass wound up between cliffs , he dismounted and led his horse and so did all his men who rode . But he paid no heed to them . He walked along as though he were alone , his body bent to the mountain , and he thought of the woman and how strangely he had come to love her and he loved her still so that he was weeping in himself and he could scarcely see the mosses of the steps . But he would not repent that he had killed her . No , in spite of his love he understood in some dim part of him , that such a woman who could deceive him so perfectly as she had when she accepted with smile and with frankness his passion , such a woman could only be true if she were dead , and he muttered to himself , " She was a fox , after all . " So he led his men steadfastly up that mountain and when he was near to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ahead to see what was in the lair , and he waited in the shade of a cluster of pine trees , for the sun beat down exceedingly hot . In less than an hour the Hawk came back and he said he had circled about the place and he gave report : " They are all unready for they are building up the lair again . " " Did you see anyone above another ? " said Wang the Tiger . " No , I did not , " answered the Hawk . " I crept so close I could even hear what they said . They are very ignorant and unlearned in robbery for the pass is not guarded , and there they are quarreling among themselves for the houses least ruined . " This was good news , and Wang the Tiger shouted to his men and at their head he ran swiftly up the pass and as he ran he gave great shouts and he commanded his men to rush into the lair and kill at least a robber apiece , and then stop so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger stood to one side and his men rushed in and shot off a round and everywhere the robbers dropped dead and writhing and crying bitterness as they lied or lay dying . It was true they were all unprepared and thinking only of their houses and of how they would establish themselves , and there must have been three or five thousand of them gathered in that lair , like ants in a mound , all piling earthen walls and carrying timbers and straw for roofs and planning for future greatness . When they were surprised like this every man dropped what he did and ran hither and thither and Wang the Tiger saw there was not one to tell them what to do and that they had no certain leader . For the first time some slight weak ray of solace came into Wang the Tiger 's heart , for well he knew who would have marshalled them , and it came to him that sooner or later he would have had to fight against the woman he loved and better to kill her as he did . P193When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose in him once we and he shouted to his men in his lordly way and commanded in to stand and he cried out to the robbers who were not shot , I am Wang the Tiger who rules this region , and I will not brook robbers ! I am not afraid to kill and not afraid to die . I will kill everyof you if you think to join others against me ! Yet I am a merciful n too , and I will make a way out for those of you who are honor-e men . I return to my encampment now in the county seat . Within next three days I will accept into my ranks any man of you who es with a gun , and if he brings two guns he shall have a free gift silver for the extra gun he has . " When he had shouted this out , Wang the Tiger called to his men rply and they all went clattering down the pass again . Only he de certain of this , that some of his men went down backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest there come ' a shot or two m some bolder robber . But the truth was those robbers were very norant men . They had fallen in with the plot of the woman who d been the Leopard 's , and they went eagerly to fetch the guns , yet w of them knew how to hold a gun , and those few only runaway Idiers , and they did not dare to fire upon Wang the Tiger lest it be thing but twisting a tiger 's whiskers and he come rushing back upon cm , and destroy them all . There was complete silence in that mountain and not a sound came ruin the lair , and as Wang the Tiger went on his way there was only the slight rise and fall of the winds in the pines and a bird calling in a tree . And he led his men down the pass . Back through the fields he led them and as he went the soldiers said everywhere in exultation to the farming folk , " Three days and the robbers will be gone , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankful , but most of them were guarded in their looks and words and waited to see what Wang the Tiger would want of them , for they had never heard of a lord of war who did anything for a countryside without asking much in return for all he did . Then Wang the Tiger went back to his own courts and he gave his soldiers each a fee of silver coins and he ordered wine of a good enough quality to be given to every man , enough to comfort him but not to make him drunken . And he had a few kinds of special meats for them . Then he waited for the three days to pass . One by one or in pairs or in fives and eights and tens the robbers began to come straggling into that city from everywhere , bringing guns with them . Seldom did any man bring two guns , for if he had laid his hand on more than one gun he brought with him a younger friend or a brother or some other one , for truly many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were glad to seek sure service under a leader somewhere . Wang the Tiger commanded that every sound man not too old be received into his army , and from such as he did not want he took the guns and paid them something . But to such men as he received he gave food and good clothing . When the three days were over he allowed three more days of mercy and after these three more , and men came in day after day until the courts and the soldiers ' camps were bursting and Wang the Tiger was forced to quarter his men into the houses of that town . Sometimesman who was the father of a family would come to complain that his house was crowded and his family squeezed into a room or two . But if he came and Wang the Tiger saw he was young or that he was bump . tious in his complaining , then Wang the Tiger threatened him and said , " Can you help it ? Bear it then ! Or would you rather have robbers in the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained were an old man or if he came courteouslyand spoke gently , then Wang the Tiger was courteous , too , and he gave him some silver or a gift of some sort , and said courteously , " It is only for a short time , for I shall march to the war soon . I shall not rest content always with so small a county seat for my capital . " And he said everywhere to all , and he said with some savage bitternessbecause he had no woman of his own any more and it galled him in some secret unknown way to think of any man with any woman , " If any soldier of mine looks on a woman forbidden , tell me , and he is dead ! " And he quartered the new soldiers in the houses nearest him , and he threatened them heartily if they did so much as look at a good woman . To every soldier also Wang the Tiger paid what he promised him . Yes , although he was now hard pressed for silver , since nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had only two thousand and odd out of the three thousand guns he had his brother buy for him , yet he paid every man and kept them all content . But he knew he could not always do this unless he could think of some new tax , for he was now drawing upon his own secret stores , and this was a dangerous thing for a lord of war to do , lest if he be suddenly put down , and must retreat somewhere for a time , he has nothing then to feed to his men . And Wang the Tiger set himself to think of some new tax . Now the spies that Wang the Tiger had sent out began to gather in again at this time , for the summer was coming to an end , and they all brought the same news , and it was that the southern generals wereP195repulsed once more and again the north was victorious . This Wang ther believed the more readily because during the last few weeks he not been hard pressed as he had been before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . So Wang the Tiger made haste , then , and he sent his nephew and trusty harelipped man and they took his letter to the capital of theince and he wrote a courteous letter regretting he had been so long ting down the robbers in that land , but now he was ready to join forces to the north against the south , and he sent gifts. ut his destiny helped him very cleverly again , for on that very dayn the pair reached the capital with this letter , truce was sworn andrebels went south to recover themselves , and the northern armiese given their days of looting for booty as a reward of their victory. when the general of that province received Wang the Tiger 's alleancehe sent back a courteous acceptance , but he said that this war as over and the autumn come . Yet doubtless there would be other wars and spring would come again , and Wang the Tiger was to hold himself ready for such a time . This was the answer the pair took back to Wang the Tiger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his name he knew would be among those of the victorious generals , and he had not lost a man and not a gun , and he had his great army whole . T HEN the golden winds of autumn blew clear out of the west and over the land once more , and the farmers reaped their harvests and the full moon swung once more to its height and the people rejoiced in the coming of the mid-autumn festival and they made ready to give thanks to the gods for these goods , that there had been no great famine and only a crop or two scarce , that the robbers had been put down once again , and that wars had not come near their region . And Wang the Tiger took account of himself where he was and how much he had achieved and he found he was better this year than last . Yes , he now had twenty thousand soldiers under him quartered in the town and in its suburbs and he had altogether nearly twelve thousandguns . Moreover , he was now known and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unready ruler whom the war had left still sitting in his place had sent out a proclamation of gratitude to all those generals who had helped him to remain when the generals of the south had tried to end his government , and Wang the Tiger 's name was among the others to whom he gave thanks and titles . It is true that the title given to Wang the Tiger was not high and it sounded longer and better than it was , but still it was a title , and for this honor he had not entered a battle or lost a gun . There remained to him this one great difficulty and it was that at the time for the feast , when it is a time of reckoning for all who lend or borrow , Wang the Merchant sent word that he must receive the money for the guns , for others pressed him for payment . Then Wang the Tiger grew quarrelsome and he parleyed with his brother and sent a man to say that this time he would not pay for the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother through this messenger , " You should have warned your agents not to turn the guns to the first who came for them . " To this Wang the Merchant answered with reason , " But how did I know that the ones who brought my own letter for proof and used your name for a sign were not your men ? " This Wang the Tiger could not answer , but he had the power of his armies to use for an argument and so he said back again in great anger , " I will pay half the loss and no more and if you do not agree to this I will pay nothing , and I do not need to do in these days what I do not wish to do . " Then Wang the Merchant , being a man prudent and full of philosophyif he could not mend a thing , agreed to it and he bore his half well enough because he could raise the certain rentals he had and he put the interest up somewhat in a place or two where he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt himself . But Wang the Tiger at first scarcely knew how to get the sum that he must pay , because he needed so much for his vast army that although a stream of silver ran into his hands every month and even every day yet it all ran out again , too . He called his trusty men into his own room and said to them in private , " Is there any revenue we could have which we do not have now ? " And his trusty men scratched their heads to warm up their brains and they looked at each other and here and there and they could not think of anything . The harelipped man said , " If we make the revenues too heavy on foods and goods the people must have every day they may turn against us . " This Wang the Tiger knew was true , for so the common people have done always if they are too pressed and must turn or else starve , and although Wang the Tiger was by now very well entrenched in that region , still he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people : So he must think of something new and at last he thought of a chief industry in that town and of a tax he could put upon it , and it was the tax of a copper coin or two on every wine jar made in that region . P197Now the wine jars of that region were famous , and they were made of a very fine pottery clay and glazed blue and when the wine was poured into them a seal of the same clay was put over the mouth and stamped with a sign , and that sign was known everywhere for a sign of good wine in a good jar . When Wang the Tiger thought of this he slapped his thigh and shouted out , " The pottery makers grow richer every year , and why should we not make them share a tax with the others ? " All the trusty men agreed to it as a very good thought , and so Wang the Tiger laid the tax that very day . He laid it courteously and he sent word for the heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he protected the sorghum lands where the cane grew for their wine , and if he did not there would be no wine for their jars , and he said he needed money to protect the lands , and his soldiers must be fed and armed and paid . But behind all this courtesy were the glittering weaponsof his thousands and although the pottery makers met together secretly and grew very angry and talked of a hundred ways and of rebelling and of many things , they knew in the end they could not refuse for Wang the Tiger could do what he liked and there were many worse than he , and this they knew . They were willing , then , since they must be , and Wang the Tiger sent his trusty men to estimate what the output of the jars was and every month there was a good full sum of silver given to Wang the Tiger , and in three months or so he paid Wang the Merchant . Then , since the pottery makers were used by this time to the tax , Wang the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not say the need for it was not so sharp as it had been . Indeed he did need all he could secure , for he had a long road yet before the end of his ambition was come , and he was restless with his ambition and he busied himself in many things . Then when he took thought and saw that he could not take much more from the people of his lands and keep them content , he cried to himself that he was too great for so small a place and in the next spring time he must enlarge himself far beyond the confines he now had , for this region was so small that if a great famine came , such as might come any year under the cruelty of heaven , he would be undone . He had been protected thus far by his good destiny , for there had been no vast famine yet since he came to this place , and only small ones in this place and that . Then the winter drew on when there can be no war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that so long as the rain and the winds did not beat too bitterly nor the snow fall too deeply , his men went out every day for training and exercise . He himself trained the best and cleverest , and these taught the others . Especially did Wang the Tiger take stock of his guns . Every month he had them counted before his eyes and tallied with his account , both in number and kind , of what he had , and he continually told his men that if there was at any time a gun not there by its tally , he would shoot a man or two or three to keep the proportion what it was . Not one dared to disobey him . More than ever they feared him , for they all knew by now that he had killed even the woman he loved . He could be so angry even as that , and they all dreaded his anger , and leaped if he so much as twisted his black brows together . Then winter came down out of the bitter north and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out nor force his men out and he faced at last what he knew was waiting for him and that against which he had been so busy . He was idle and he was alone . Now did he wish he were like other men who turn eagerly to gamblingor to the drinking of wine or to feasting or to the seeking out of some woman to divert them from any trouble they may have . But Wang the Tiger was not so . He had eaten plain food and liked it better than a feast , and the thought of any woman sickened him . Once and twice he tried to game , but he had not the temper for it . He was not quick at dice or at seizing a chance and when he lost he grew angry and felt for his sword and those who gamed with him were alarmed when they saw his brows begin to twist and his mouth grow more surly than it was and when they saw his big hand fly to his hilt , and they made haste to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , and he cried out , " It is a fool 's game , as I ever said it was ! " and he flung himself away furious because he was not diverted nor eased at all . Worse than the day was the night that must come and he hated it more than the day , for he slept alone and he must sleep alone . Now this loneliness by day and by night was not a good thing for such a man as Wang the Tiger for he had a heavy bitter heart that did not see mirth as some do , who have even more to bear than he , and the lonely sleep was not good either , for he had a strong and craving body . Still there was not a soul whom he could take for friend . It was true that the old magistrate lived still in a side court with his old wife who was now dying of a consumption , and he was in his way a good and learned old man . But he was so unused to men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fork his two old hands together and make haste to say whenever Wang the Tiger spoke to him , " Yes , Honoredyes , General ! " And Wang the Tiger was wearied of this after a while and scowled at the old scholar so fearsomely that he turned the color of clay and heP199scuttled out of the rooms as soon as he dared , his faded robes dragging On his thin old body . Yet Wang the Tiger held back his impatience , too , for he was a lustan and he knew the old magistrate did the best he could and oftensent him away quickly before his impatience grew too high lest he ! tight grow angry and do damage to the old man and his hand fly out before he meant it to do so . There were his trusty men also , three good and true warriors , and the Hawk was indeed a very good warrior and better than a thousand common soldiers in his cleverness of guile . Still he was but an ignorant man and he could only talk of the ways there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sparring with fists and of kicking with the right foot and the left in a circle before the enemy can recover himself , and such ways and feints of battle , and when he had told these over and over and told how he had done this and done so in some fight or other he had had somewhere , he had told all he knew and Wang the Tiger wearied of him even while he valued him . There was that Pig Butcher and he was very able with his great , nimble fists and his thick body that he could throw against a gate and crush it in , yet he was but heavy , stammering company on a winter 's night . And there was the trusty harelipped man , the truest best soul althoughno great warrior , either , and best when sent on some message , and his hissing and spitting when he . talked could be no pleasure . Nor would Wang the Tiger stoop to talk with his nephew who was a generationbeneath him , nor would he descend to feasting and carousing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leader does this and if he lets himself be common and play among his own men and lets them see him weak and drunken , on the day of battle they will not reverence him or hear his command , and indeed Wang the Tiger took great care never to appear- before his own men unless he wore his full accoutrementsof war and unless he had his sharp sword he had used in such a way that now he loved and hated it too . Yet it was so keen a blade that he could never find its mate in the world , and he used to take it out and look at it and muse sometimes when he was alone and think how if he brought it down upon a cloud even it would cut it in two . Her throat had been as soft as that and so the blade . had done that night . But even if Wang the Tiger had had friends in the day there must come the night at the end of every day and he must be alone then perforceand he lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very long and black . Through such long black nights must Wang the Tiger lie alone and sometimes he lit a taper candle and read his old books he had loved as a lad and which had first turned his mind to soldiering , the stories of the three kingdoms and of the robbers that bordered a great lake , and he read many doughty tales like these . But he could not read forever . The candle burned down to the end of its reed wick , and he grew cold and he must lie alone at last in the black and bitter night . Then , although every night he put off this hour , yet the hour came when he remembered the woman he loved and he mourned for her . But he did not in all his mourning wish her living again , for he knew and he steadfastly told himself that she could never have been one whom he could have trusted and the sweetness of his love had been that he had opened his whole heart to her . No , dead he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had prevented and pardoned her , still he would have been afraid of her always . The fear would have divided him , so that only half his heart would have gone on in his cause and he would never have risen to be great . So he told himself in the night . Yet he pondered painfully on this , that the Leopard , who had been but an ignorant fellow , risen but a little above his robber band , could have so won the love of the woman , who was no common woman , that even though he were dead , yet did she cleave to him and even against her living love she clave to the dead man still . For Wang the Tiger could not believe she had never loved him . No , he remembered over and over with hunger when he thought of it how frank she had been and passionate upon this very bed where he now lay . He would not believe that such passion had sprung up where no love was . And he grew wretched and weak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all his pride and place , than the Leopard he had killed , because his living hold upon the woman had been less than the memory of the dead man in her . He could not understand all this , but only he felt it must be so . And feeling himself less of a man than he thought , his life stretched ahead of him long and meaningless and he doubted himself that he could ever be great and if he did then for what use , seeing he had no son for whom to achieve greatness , and it would all die with him and what he had go to others . He did not love his brothers or his brothers ' sons enough to struggle in war and guile for them . And he groaned to himself in the dark and silent room and he groaned out , " When I killed her I killed two , and the other was the son I might have had ! " Then he remembered again and he always saw her now as she looked when she lay dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . When he saw her thus again and again , he could not bear it , and suddenly he could not lie any longer on this bed , no , although it had been washed and painted freshly and the blood stains were gone and the pillow was anew , and although no one had ever mentioned to him what had happened there nor had he ever knownP20Iwhere they took her body . He rose from the bed and he wrapped his quilts about him and sat miserable and shivering upon a chair , until the feeble dawn came and showed pale and chill through his lattices . So the winter nights wore on the same , night after night , and at last Wang the Tiger cried out to himself that this could not be , for these sad and lonely nights were making him less than a man and they were sucking- the ambition out of him . He grew afraid for himself because nothing seemed good to him any more and he was impatient with all who came near , and most of all did he grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the best I have , this grinning pocked ape , son of a tradesman this is nearest I have to my own son ! " At last when it seemed he must go mad a turn came in his own spirit and it came to him one night that the woman even though dead was ruining him as surely as she would have done if she had been alive and gone the way she planned . And suddenly he hardened himself and it seemed he spoke to her own ghost to defy her and he said in his own heart , " Can not any woman have sons , and do I not desire a son more than any mere woman ? I will have a son . I will take a woman or two or three until I have a son . I have been a fool that I do always cling so to one womanfirst to a woman I never even knew beyond a few scatteredwords such as a man may speak to a slave in . his fathers ' house and I went sore for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one I had to kill . Shall I never be rid of her too and shall I go sore for her another ten years and be too old to beget a son then ? No , I shall be as other men are and I will see if I can not make myself free as other men do and take a woman and leave her again when I please . " On that very day he called his trusty harelipped man to him and he called him into his own private room and . he said , " I have need of a woman , any woman of a decent kind , and go and tell my brothers that my wife is dead and tell them to find me somethirgsince I am busy with the wars that must come in the spring time and I do not care to deviate my thoughts from the wars . " The harelipped man went gladly on this errand then , for he had seen with jealous eyes at least a little of what his general suffered and had guessed the cause , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could but wait to see what time would bring and what his two brothers would do for him , and while he waited he forced himself to plan his wars and to think how he would enlarge himself . And he schemed how to weary himself into sleep at night .   BY winding ways , lest men mark his harelip and wonder at his frequent coming , the trusty man came to the town and thence to the great house where the Brothers Wang lived . He asked and found that Wang the Merchant was at this ' hour , which was nearly noon , in his counting house , and there the trusty man went at once to give his message . Wang the Merchant sat in his own part of the countinghouse , a small dark room which gave off the main market , and he was fingering an abacus and reckoning certain profits he had made on a ship 's load of wheat . He looked up and listened to the trusty man 's tale , and when he had heard he said , astounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursed , " Now I can get even silver more easily for him than I can get a woman . How should I know where to turn for a woman ? It is an . ill thing he has lost the one he had . " The trusty man , sitting cornerwise upon a lowly seat to show he felt his place , answered humbly saying , " All I ask , my master 's brother , is that you find a sort of woman who will not trouble our general and make him love her . He has a strange deep heart and he so fixes himself on one thing that it is a madness with him . So he loved this woman who died and he has not forgotten her yet , no , although months have passed he does not forget her and such constancy in a man is not good for his health . " " How did she die ? " asked Wang the Merchant curiously . But the trusty man was very faithful and discreet and he stopped himself as he was about to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranks of soldiers and not acquainted with war-like things , they grow squeamish and they can not bear killing and dying as soldiers must , whose trade it is to kill and be killed if they can not save themselves by guile . So he said simply , " She died of a sudden flow of blood , " and Wang the Merchant let it be at that . Then he sent the trusty man away , first bidding a clerk to take him to some small inn and feed him with rice and pork , and after they were gone Wang the Merchant sat and mused and he thought to himself , " Well , and here is a time when that older brother of mine will know more than I , for if he knows anything at all it is women , and what woman do I know except the one I have ? " Then Wang the Merchant rose to go out and find his brother , Wang the Landlord , and he took from a nail in the wall his grey silk robeP203that he wore when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spare it wear , and he went to his brother 's house and he asked the gateman to know if his master were at home that day . The gateman would have led him in , but Wang the Merchant would wait , and the gateman went in and asked a slave and the slave replied that he was at a certain gaming house . When Wang the Merchant heard this he went to that place , choosing his way as delicately as a cat over the cobbled street , because it had snowed in the night and the day was so cold that even yet t lie snow lay there , and there was only a little path in the middle made by vendors and those who must go out for a living or as his brother did , for pleasure . He came to the gaming house and he asked a clerk and heard that his brother was within at a certain door , and Wang the Merchant went to it and opened it and found Wang the Landlord there gaming with certain of his friends in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang the Landlord saw his brother 's head come in at the door he was secretly glad to be disturbed and called away , for he was not over-skilled at gaming , since he had learned the thing late in life . Wang Lung , his father , would not have let a son of his gamble in city gaming houses if he had known it . But Wang the Landlord 's son was quick and able enough because he had gamed all his life long , and even the second son had been able to gain a little pile of silver at any game he had a share in . So when Wang the Landlord saw his brother 's head come in at the partly opened door he rose readily and said in haste to his friends , " I must stop , for my brother needs me for something , " and he took up his fur coat he had laid aside in the heat of the room and went out to where Wang the Merchant waited . But he did not say he was glad he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost at gaming , since a clever man should win . He only said , " Have you something to say to me ? " Wang the Merchant answered in his scanty way , " Let us go where we can talk , if there is such a place in this house . " Then Wang the Landlord led the way to a place where there were tables for tea drinking , and they chose a lonely table set a little apart from the others , and there the two brothers seated themselves , and Wang the Merchant waited while Wang the Landlord ordered tea and then wine and then bethinking himself of the hour , he ordered some meats and dishes of food . At last the serving man was gone , and Wang the Merchant began forthright , " That younger brother of ours wants a wife , for his woman is dead and he has sent to us this time . I thought here is a thing you can managebetter than I. "   This Wang the Merchant said drawing down his lips in a secret smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed out loud and his fat cheeks shook and he said , " Well , and if I know anything at all it is such things , and you are right but it would not do to say it before my lady , though ! " And he laughed and looked sidewise out of his eyes as men will when they talk of these matters . But Wang the Merchant would not joke with him and he waited . Wang the Landlord sobered himself then and he said , further , " But this comes at a very good time , for I have been looking over the maids of this town for my son , and I know all the likely maids . I have a plan now to betroth the eldest one of my sons to a maid nineteenyears of age , a daughter of the younger brother of the magistratea very good , honorable maid , and my son 's mother has seen some of the samples of her embroidery and handiwork . She is not pretty but very honorable . The only trouble is my son has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of such new ways in the south . " But I tell him it is not known here to do such things , and besides he can choose others he likes . As for that poor hunchback , his mother wants a priest in the family , and it seems a pity to waste a good straight son in such a way " But Wang the Merchant was not interested in all these doings of his brother 's family , for it is known as a matter of course that every son must be wed sooner or later and his own sons also , but he did not waste his time on such things , deeming them women 's duty , and he had put it all into his wife 's hands , saying only that such maids as came into his house must be virtuous and stout and hard working . So he broke in now with impatience , " But are any of the maids you saw fit for our brother , and are their fathers willing to have them go into a house to wife one already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landlord would not hasten himself over such a dainty job as this and he let his memory linger upon the maids , this one and that , and on all he knew from what he had heard of them and he said , " There is a very good maid , not too young , whose father is a scholar and he has made her into something of a scholar , too , he having no son and needing to teach someone what he knew . She is what they call now-a-days a new woman , such as have learning and do not bind their feet , and because she is strange in this way , her marriage has been delayed , because men have not dared to take a woman like this for their sons , lest a trouble come out of it . But I hear there are many like her in the south , and it is only because this is a small old city , doubtless , thatp205men here do not know what to make of her . She goes on the street even and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stare about her , either . With all her learning she is not so hideous as might be feared , and if she is not very young yet she can not be more than twenty-five or six . Do you think my brother would fancy such a one who is not like a usual woman ? " To this Wang the Merchant answered with reserve , " But do you think she will make a good housewife and be useful to him ? He reads and writes himself as well as many a man does , and if he did not he could hire it done for him by some scholar . I do not see that he needs all this learning in a wife . " Then Wang the Landlord , who had been dipping food into his bowl busily , the serving man having come to and fro many times with dishes , paused and held his porcelain spoon in mid-air full of a soup and he cried , " He can hire a servant too , I swear , or a jade , and it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good wife . The chief thing is whether or not she fits a man 's fancy or not , especially if he is one like my brother who will not seek out other women . Sometimes I think it would be a pleasant thing to tickle a man if his wife could sit and read poetry to him or some tale of love as he lies on his bed to sleep . " But this was distasteful to Wang the Merchant and he picked delicatelyat a dish of pigeons stewed with chestnuts and thrust his chopstickscarefully between the bones to find the bit he relished and he said , " I would rather fit my fancy to a woman careful in the house and who had children and who could save money . " Then Wang the Landlord grew suddenly angry in the wilful way he had even since his childhood and his great full face turned a dark red and Wang the Merchant saw they would never agree on this , and it was not a thing to waste his day upon , for women are but women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final purpose of a man as well as another , so he said quickly , " Ah , well , and that brother of ours is not poor , and let us choose two wives for him then . Do you choose the one you think best , and we will wed him to her first , and then awhile later send him the one I choose , and if he likes one better than the other let him , but two are not many for such a man as he in his position . " Thus they compromised , and Wang the Landlord was pleased that the one he chose was to be the wife , although when he thought , it seemed no more than his due , for no man could lie with two wives on his wedding night , and , after all , he was the eldest son in this family and the head . So they agreed and then parted and Wang the Landlord went bustling to do his part and Wang the Merchant went back to his house to find his wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the gate standing in the snowy street , her hands wrapped in her apron to warm them , but ever and again she brought them out to probe the crops of fowls that a vendor had there to sell . The snow had made such fowls cheaper than usual since they could not find their own food and she wished to add a hen or two to her stock and as Wang the Merchant came near she did not look up but continued to peer at the fowls . But Wang the Merchantsaid to her as he passed , to go into the house , " Have done , woman , come here . " Then she made haste and chose two hens and after quarreling over their weight upon the scales to which the vendor hung them by their legs tied together , they agreed upon the price and she came into the house and thrust the hens under a chair and then sat down cornerwise on it to hear what her husband had to say to her and he said in his dry , scanty way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his has died suddenly . I know nothing of women , but you have had your eyes hanging out these two years looking for wives for our sons . Is there one we could send there ? " His wife answered readily , for she delighted in all such things as birth and death and marriage and her constant talk was of these , " There is a very good maid who lived next door to me in my own village , and she is so good I have often wished that she were young enough for our eldest . She is the pleasantest-tempered maid , and very saving , and she has no fault at all except that her teeth grew black even when she was a child from some worm that ate them away , it is said , and now they drop out sometimes . But she is ashamed of this and keeps her lips drawn down to hide them , so they are not easily seen , and because of this she talks very little and very low . Her father is not poor either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have her wed so well , I know , seeing that she is already a little beyond the age . " Then Wang the Merchant said dryly , " If she can not talk much that will be worth something . See to it , and after the wedding we will send her . " And he told his wife that two women were to be chosen , and she said loudly , " Well , I feel sorry for him if he has to have one of your brother 's choosing for what does he know except lewd women , and I vow if his lady has anything to do with it she will choose a nunnish creature , for I hear now she is so daft over priests and nuns she would have the whole house praying and mumming . It is well enough , I say , to go to the temple once in a way if there is someone sick of a fever or if a woman is childless or something , but I daresay the gods are like all of us , and we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and calling at us for this and that ! "  |p207And  she spat on the floor and rubbed the place with her foot , and forgetting the hens under her chair , she thrust her feet back and struck them and they set up a mighty squawking , so that Wang the Merchant rose and called out impatiently , " I never saw such a house ! Must we have hens everywhere ? " And when she reached under hastily to drag the fowls out and explainhow the price of them was less than usual now , he broke in to what she began to say and said , " Let belet beI must go back to my markets . Attend to the thing and this day two months or so we will call her . Only keep all the costs well in mind for the law does not require that we pay over again for my brother 's wedding . " Thus the thing was done and the two maids were betrothed and the deeds drawn up and Wang the Merchant entered the costs carefully into his counting books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding . Now the day was near the end of the old year , and Wang the Tiger when he had been told of it , made ready to go to his brother 's house to wed once more . He had no heart to do the thing and yet he had determinedhe would and so he gave over any thought or wavering and he made ready his three trusty men he appointed to watch in his stead , and he left his nephew to be messenger if any trouble should rise while he was gone . When he had done this he made a feint of asking permission of the old magistrate to leave for five days and six days for the journey to come and to go , and the old magistrate made haste to give his permission . And Wang the Tiger took precaution to tell the old magistrate that he left his army and his trusty men , lest there be some vague hope of rising against him somehow . Then clothing himself in his next best garments and taking his best with . him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south to his home , taking with him a small guard of fifty armed men , for he was a man of such courage that he did not , as many lords of war do , surround himself with hundreds of inner and outer guards . Through . the wintry country Wang the Tiger rode , stopping at villageinns by night , and riding on again over the frozen earthen roads . There was no sign yet of spring , and the land lay grey and harsh , and the houses made of the grey clay and thatched with the grey straw , seemed but part of the land . Even the people , bitten with the winds and dust of the northern winter were grey of the same hue , and Wang the Tiger felt no joy rise in his heart these three days , as he rode toward his father 's home . When he was come he went to his elder brother 's house , since there he was to be wed , and when he had given them brief greeting he said abruptly that before he wed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's grave . And this they all approved , and especially Wang the Landlord 's lady , for it was a decent , proper thing to do , seeingthat Wang the Tiger had been so long away , and he had not shared in the regular times that the family paid such respect to their dead . But Wang the Tiger , although he knew his duty and when he could he did it , now performed it partly because he was restless and dreary in himself , and he did not know why he was either . But he could not bear to sit in his brother 's house idle , and he could not bear his brother 's unctuous pleasure at the coming wedding , and he was oppressed in himself and he must needs think of some excuse to be out and away from them all , because this house did not seem his home . He sent a soldier then to buy the paper money and the incense and all such things as are useful to the dead and with these he went out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their guns on their shoulders . He took a little faint comfort to see how people stared at him on the street and although he held his face still and stared ahead seeming to see and to hear nothing , still he heard his soldiers shout out roughly , " Way for the general , way for our lord ! " And as he saw the common people shrink back against the walls and into the gateways he was a little comforted because he was so great to them , and he held himself erect in his state and pomp . Thus he came to the graves under the date tree which by now had grown knotted and gnarled , although when Wang Lung had first chosen that place to lay his dead , it was a smooth young tree . Now other date trees had sprung from it , and Wang the Tiger , having dismountedwhile he was yet a long way off to show his respect , came slowly to these trees and one of the soldiers stood and held the red horse , and Wang the Tiger walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave of his father . There he made obeisance three times , and the soldiers who carried the money and the incense came forward and arranged it , the most at Wang Lung 's grave and the next at the grave of Wang Lung 's father and the next at the grave of Wang Lung 's brother , and the least at 0-lan 's grave , whom Wang the Tiger could remember but dimly as his mother . Then Wang the Tiger went forward again in his slow and stately way and he lit the incense and the paper and he knelt and knocked his head the number of times he should before every grave and when this was finished he stood motionless and meditated , while the fire burned and the silver and the gold paper turned to ash and the incense smoulderedsharp and fragrant upon the wintry air of that day . There was no sunshine and no wind , a grey chill day such as may bring snow , P209and the warm slight smoke of the incense curled clearly in the chill air . The soldiers waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished with his father and at last Wang the Tiger turned away and walked to his horse and mounted it and went back along the path he had come . But while he meditated he had not thought at all of his father Wang Lung . He thought of himself and of how when he lay dead there would not be one to come and do him reverence as son to father , and when he thought of this it seemed well to him that he was to be wed and he bore a little better the dreariness he had in his soul for the hope of a son . Now the path on which Wang the Tiger rode skirted the threshold of the earthen house and passed by the edge of the threshing floor that was its door yard , and the noise of the soldiers roused the hunchback youth who lived there with Pear Blossom and he came hobbling out as quickly as he could and stood staring . He did not know Wang the Tiger at all , or even that this was his uncle , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For all he was now nearly sixteen years old and soon to be a man , he stood scarcely taller than a child of six or seven , and his back rose curved like a hood behind his head and Wang the Tiger was astonished at the sight of him and he asked , drawing his horse back , " Who are you who live here in my earthen house ? " Then the lad knew him , for he had heard he had an uncle who was a general and he often dreamed of him and wondered what he was like , and now he cried out , yearningly , " Are you my uncle ? " Then Wang the Tiger remembered , and he said slowly , still staring down at the lad 's upturned face , " Yes , I have heard somewhere that my brother had a brat like you . Strange , for we are all so straight and strong and so was my father , too , the straightest , strongest old man , even in his age . " Then the lad answered simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were long used , and he stared avidly at the soldiers as he said it , and at the high red horse , " But I was dropped . " Then he stretched out his hand toward Wang the Tiger 's gun and he peered up out of his strange aged face and his little , sad sunken eyes , and he said eagerly , " I have never held one of those foreign guns in my hand and I would like to hold it for a moment'stime . " When he stretched up his hands thus , a little dried , wrinkled hand like an old man 's , out of a sudden pity for this poor warped lad Wang the Tiger handed him down his own gun to feel and to look at . And as he waited for the lad to have his fill of it , one came to the door . ItP2I0 was Pear Blossom . Wang the Tiger knew her instantly , for she had not changed much except to grow thinner even than she had been , and her face , always pale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly into the pale skin . But her hair was as smooth and black as ever . Then Wang the Tiger bowed very stiffly and deeply but without descending from his horse , and Pear Blossom gave a little bow and would have turned quickly away except that Wang the Tiger called out , " Is the fool still living and well ? " And Pear Blossom answered in her soft small voice , " She is well . " And Wang the Tiger asked again , " Do you have your full due every month ? " And she answered again in the same voice , " I thank you , I have all my due , " and she held her head down as she spoke and looked at the beaten ground of the threshing floor and this time when she had answeredhim she went swiftly away and he was left staring at the empty doorway . Then he said suddenly to the lad , " Why does she wear a robe that is like a nun 's ? " for he had seen without knowing he did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nun 's are . The lad answered , scarcely thinking of what he said , so longing and fixed was his heart upon the gun as he fingered it and smoothed its wood , " When the fool is dead she will go into the nunnery near here and be a nun . She eats no meat at all now and she knows many prayers by heart and she is a lay nun already . But she will not leave the world and cut off her hair until the fool dies , because my grandfather left her the fool . " Wang the Tiger heard this and he was silent a moment in some vague pain and at last he said pityingly to the lad , " What will you do then , you poor hunched ape ? " And the lad made answer , " When she goes into the nunnery I am to be a priest in the temple because I am . But if I am a priest I can be fed and if I am ill and I am often ill with this thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , since we are kin . " This the boy said carelessly . Then his voice changed and grew half sobbing with some passion , and he looked up at Wang the Tiger and cried out , " Yes , I am to be a priestbut , oh , I wish that I were straight and then I would be a soldierif you would have me , Uncle ! " There was such fire in his sunken dark eyes that Wang the Tigerp211was moved by it , and he answered sorrowfully , for he was a merciful man at heart , " I would have you gladly , you poor thing , but shaped as you are , what can you be now but a priest ! " And the lad hung his head out of its strange socket and he said in a small , low voice , " I know it . " Without another word he handed the gun back to Wang the Tiger and he turned and limped away across the threshing floor . And Wang the Tiger went on his way to his marriage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was in no burninghaste this time , and day and night were alike to him . He went through it all silently and decorously as he did everything he had to do unless a rage came over him . But now ' love and rage seemed forever equally far from his dead heart , and the red-robed figure of the bride was like some dim , distant figure with which he had nothing at all to do . So also the guests , and so the figures of his brothers and their wives and children , and the monstrous fat figure of Lotus , leaning on Cuckoo . Yet he looked at her once , too , for she panted as she breathed she was so heavy with her flesh and Wang the Tiger could hear this thick gusty breathing as he stood to bow to his elder brothers and to those who sponsored the woman and to the guests and to all those to whom he must bow in ceremony . But when the wedding feast was brought he scarcely tasted this dish or that , and when Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merriment even at a man 's second wedding , and when a guest took up the laughter , it died away into feebleness and silence beforeWang the Tiger 's grave face . He said nothing at all at his own wedding feast except that when the wine was brought he took up the bowl quickly as though he were thirsty . But when he had tasted it he set the bowl down again and he said harshly , " If I had known the wine would be no better than this I would have brought a jar of the wine of my own region . " After the days of wedding were over , he mounted his red horse and went away and he did not cast one look behind at the bride and her serving maid who came behind him in a mule cart , with the curtains drawn . No , he rode on as seeming solitary as he had been when he came , his soldiers at his heels , and the cart lumbering behind them . Thus Wang the Tiger brought his bride to his own regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more the second woman came under her father 's care , and her he received also , since one or two were the same to him . P2I2Then the New Year drew on and its festivals and these passed , and it was the time when spring first begins to stir in the earth , although no sign of it could yet be seen in any leaf upon a tree . Yet there were signs , too , for the snow , if it came on a chill grey day , did not lie but melted in the sudden heat of a warm wind that blew fitfully out of the south , and the wheat plants in the fields , while they did not yet grow , took on a fresher green , and everywhere farmers stirred themselves out of their winter idleness and looked to their hoes and their rakes and fed their oxen a little better to prepare them for labor . By the roadsides the weeds began to send up shoots and children roamed everywhere with their knives and pointed bits of wood and tin if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . So also did the lords of war bestir themselves in their winter quarters and soldiers stretched their full-fed bodies and wearied of their gaming and brawling and idling about towns where they were entrenched and they stirred themselves to wonder what their fortunes could be in the new wars of the spring , and every soldier dreamed a little and hoped that one above him might be killed and give him place . So also did Wang the Tiger dream of what he would do . Yes , he had a scheme , and it was a good one , and now he could put himself to it for it seemed to him that his gnawing , nagging love was dead . Or , if not dead , then buried somewhere , and whenever he was troubled by its memory he went deliberately to one of those two wives of his , and if his flesh lagged , he drank wine deeply to rouse it . And being a very just man , he showed no favor to one wife above the other , although they were very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a plain and quiet way , and the other somewhat uncouth , but still a woman of virtue and of good heart . Her greatest fault was her blackened teeth , and that she had a very foul breath if one came near her . But even so Wang the Tiger was fortunate in that they did not quarrel , these two women . Yet doubtless his justice helped this , for he was scrupulous and he went to them each in turn , and the truth was they were the same to him and alike nothing . But he need no longer lie alone unless he wished . Still , he never grew familiar with either woman , and he always went in to them haughtily and for a set purpose and he made no speech with them and there was no frankness as there had been between him and the one dead and he never gave himself freely . Sometimes he pondered on this difference that a man may feel toward women , and when he did he told himself bitterly that the one dead had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed as free as a harlot , for all the time she hugged her design against him in her heart . When he thought of this Wang the Tiger sealed his heart again and calmed his flesh with his two wives . And he had this for aP213hope and for a fresh light to his ambition , and it was that from one of the twain surely he might have his son at last . In this hope Wang the Tiger encouraged his dreams of glory once more and he swore that in this very year in this very spring he would go forth to a great war somewhere and win for himself power and wide territories , and he saw the victory already his own . THEN as spring blossomed and the white cherry trees and the-pale pink peach blooms lay like light clouds over the green land , Wang the Tiger took counsel with his trusty men as to war and they waited for two things . The first was to see how the war would renew itself between the lords of north and south , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tenuous and it was but a truce of the winter when it is not convenient to do battle in wind and snow and mud . Aside from this , the lords of north and south so differedin their nature , the one being large in body and slow and fierce , and the other little tricky men , good in guile and ambush , that with such difference in temper and even in blood and language , it was not easy for them to agree upon long truce . The other thing for which Wang the Tiger waited and his trusty men with him was for the return of the many spies he sent out early in the year . And while they waited Wang the Tiger took counsel with his trusty men as to what tetritory they might attach to what they had and so enlarge the region . Now they took counsel together in the great room which Wang the Tiger used for his own and there they sat , each according to his rank , and the Hawk said , " North we can not go , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pig Butcher said loudly , for it was his way to speak whateverthe Hawk said , like a rude echo , for he did not like to be thought less wise than the Hawk , and yet he himself could not think easily of a new thing to say , " Yes , but even so , it is a very poor and meager land there , and the pigs are so accursed and so thin they are no use butchering . I have seen those pigs and I swear their backs are sharp as curved scythes , and a sow 's pigs can be counted before ever she gives them birth . It is not a country anyone wants to wage a war to gain . " But Wang the Tiger said slowly , " Yet south we can not go , for if we do we will strike my own and my father 's folk , and a man can not tax his own people freely and with an easy mind . " P2I4Now the harelipped man spoke little and never until the others had their say out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a region where my native land once was , but it is nothing to me now , and it is to the southeast of this , between here and the sea , a very rich country , and one end of it lies against the sea . There is a whole county spread out edgewise along a river there that flows to the sea , too , and it is a good country , full of fields and it has a low ridge of hills , and the river is full of fish . The county seat is the only large town , but there are many villages and market towns and the people are thrifty and do well . " Wang the Tiger heard this and he said , " Yes , but such a good place is not likely to be without its lord of war . Who is it ? " Then the trusty man named the name of one who had once been a robber chief and the very year before this one had thrown in his lot with the south . When he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go against this robber chief , and he remembered to this day how he hated the men of the south and how tasteless their soft rice and peppered meats had been and there was nothing for a man to set his good teeth down upon to chew it , and he remembered the hateful years of his youth and he cried out , " The very place and the very man , for it will enlarge me and it will count in the general wars , as well ! " As swiftly as this was the thing decided and Wang the Tiger shouted to a serving man to bring wine and they all drank and Wang the Tiger gave his commands that the soldiers were to be prepared for movement and they were to march to the new lands as soon as the first spies returned to tell of what the great war was to be this year . Then the trusty men rose to take their leave and to fulfill these commands , but the Hawk lingered after the others went away , and he leaned and whispered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarse and his breath hot upon Wang the Tiger 's cheek , and he said , " We must let the soldiers have the usual days of looting after the battle , for they mutter among themselves and they complain that you hold them in so tight and they do not have the privileges under your banner that other lords of war give . They will not fight if they can not loot . " Then Wang the Tiger gnawed the stiff black hair he had let grow these days about his lips and he said very unwillingly , for he knew the Hawk was right , " Well , then tell them they are to have the three days when the victoryis ours , but no more . " The Hawk went away well pleased , but Wang the Tiger sat sullen for a while , for the truth was he hated this looting of the people , andp2I5yet what else could he do , seeing that soldiers will not risk their lives to fight without this reward ? So , although he agreed to it , he was ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but see in his mind the picture of the suffering of those people , and he cursed himself for a man too soft for the trade he had chosen . And he forced himself to be hard and he told himself that after all it must be the rich who lose most , since the poor have nothing of worth to anyone , and the rich can bear it . But he was ashamed he , was so weak and not for anything would he have had a man of his know he shrank from seeing pain , lest he be despised . Then the spies returned , one after the other , and each in his turn reported to their general , and they said that although no war as yet was broken forth , yet the lords of north and of south were buying weapons from outer countries and war must come , for everywhere armies were being enlarged and strengthened . Now when Wang the Tiger heard this he decided that he would begin without delay upon his own privatewar , and on that very day he commanded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates , for there was so vast a number they could not gather together inside , and he rode there upon his high red horse with his bodyguard behind him , and to his right his pocked nephew sat , no longer upon an ass , but now upon a good horse , for Wang the Tiger had given him a position there . And Wang the Tiger held himself erect and exceedingly proud , and his men all stared at him in silence , for indeed he was such a warrior as is not often seen in the world for great good looks and heavy fierce brows and on his lips the hair he had let newly grow made him look older than his forty years . Thus before them he sat motionless and he let them stare at him awhile , and suddenly he lifted his voice out'in a shout and he called to all his men , " Soldiers and heroes ! Tomorrow six days and we will march to the southeast and we will take that region . It is a rich and fertile land borderingupon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will share with you . You are to divide under my two trusty men , and the Hawk will lead from the east and the Pig Butcher from the west . I myself with my picked five thousand men will wait to the north and when you have attackedfrom two sides and hold the city fast , which is the center to the region , I will rush in and close and crush the last resistance . There is a lord of war there , but he is only a robber , and well you have shown me how you can deal with robbers , my good fellows ! " Then he added , but very unwillingly although he had hardened himself for it , " If you are victorious you are to have freedom in that city for three days . But on the dawn of the fourth day your freedom ends . He who does not answer the call of the bugles I shall cause to be blown for a sign to you , him will I kill . I am not afraid to die and not afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ! "   Then the men shouted out and they stirred restlessly and as soon as Wang the Tiger had gone away they grew very eager and greedy and anxious to be off and every man looked to his weapons and cleaned and sharpened all and he counted the bullets he had . At that time many a man bartered with others for bullets , and those who were weak in their desire for wine or for a turn at a wench paid over their bullets as far as they dared for that for which they yearned . On the dawn of the sixth day Wang the Tiger led his mighty army out of the city . Yet great as it was he left a small half behind , and he went to the old magistrate who now lay on his bed and never rose from it he grew so weak , and Wang the Tiger told the old man that he left the army to protect him and his court . The magistrate thanked him in his feeble courteous way , but well he knew the army was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was its head , and it was a hard place , for the soldiers were discontented to be left behind , and Wang the Tiger was compelled to promise them a dole of extra silver if they did well and guarded faithfully and he promised them that the next war would be theirs . So they were content a little , or at least less discontent . Then at the head of his army Wang the Tiger went out , and he caused it to be told among the city people that he went to wage war again for them against an encroaching enemy from the south , and the people were afraid and eager to please him , and the guild of merchantsthere gave him a sum for a gift , and many from the city followed the army as they left the city that day and they stayed to see Wang the Tiger 's ensign set up and the sacrifice made to it of a killed pig and incense so that good fortune might attend the war . When this was over Wang the Tiger went on in good earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wage the war , but he had brought a goodly sum of silver , too , for he was too clever a generalto plunge at once into battle , and he would parley and wait and see how silver could be used , and at least if silver was useless at first in the end it might serve something and buy over some important man to open the gates of the city to them . It was now the middle of spring and the wheat was two feet high or so over miles of that countryside and ready to head , and Wang the Tiger cast his eyes far and wide over that green land as he rode . He had a pride in its beauty and fruitfulness for it was his own to rule and he loved it as a king may love his realm . Yet he was wise and with all his eye for its beauty he could keep his wits sharp for some new place to fix a tax to maintain this vast army he now had and for his private store he must increase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he had come far enough south so that he came to groves of pomegranate trees and sawP217em putting out from their gnarled grey branches the tiny flamecolorednew leaves that come late and after all other trees are leaved , be knew he was in the new lands . He looked everywhere then to see what these were , and everywhere he saw fruitful , nurtured fields , and well fed beasts and fat children and he rejoiced at it all . But as hepassed with his men the folk upon the lands looked up at them andowled to see them aid women who had been the moment beforetalking and laughing in their gossip together grew silent and pale and pared and many a mother put her hand over her child 's eyes . And if the soldiers burst into some song of war as they did often when they parched , then men in the fields cursed aloud to hear the quiet airtoken like this . The very dogs rushed furiously out of the villages to ip . the strangers , but when they saw so vast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their bellies . very now and again an ox broke loose from where it was tied and fled as fast as it could because of the noise of so many men passing , and sometimesif it were yoked it ran plow and all and the farmer plowman after It . Then the soldiers guffawed loudly , but Wang the Tiger if he saw it popped courteously until the man had his beast in hand again . In the towns and hamlets also the people were silent and stricken when the soldiers came pushing through the gates clamoring and laughing and hungry for tea and wine and bread and meat , and shop keepers scowled over their counters because they feared their wares gone and they not paid for them , so that some drew the wooden doors over their open shops as though the night were come . But Wang the Tiger had early given command that nothing should be seized withoutpayment and he had given his men money for such things as they needed to eat and to drink . Yet well he knew that the best general can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he had told his captains he would hold them responsible , yet he knew no small amount of evil must surely be done , and he could only shout , " If I hear of it I will kill you ! " and he trusted that the men would subdue themselves somewhat , and he did not try to hear everything . But Wang the Tiger planned this way to control his men to some degree . When they came to a town he made them stay in a suburb and he went with only a few hundred first and he sought the richest merchant in that place . When he had found him he commanded him to gather together the other merchants and he waited in the richest merchant 's shop . When they were all there before him very fearful and courteous , then Wang the Tiger was courteous , too , and he said , " Do not fear that I shall be extortionate and take more than I ought . It is true I have many thousands of men in the suburb , but give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will lead my men on and we will not stay here but the night . "   Then the merchants , all pale and fearful , would put forward the spokesman they had chosen and he would stammer forth a sum , but Wang the Tiger knew well it was the lowest they could name , and he would smile coolly but he drew down his brows while he smiled , and he said , " I see the fine shops you have , the oil shops and the grain markets and the silks and the cloths and I see your people how well they are fed and clothed and how good your streets are . Do you cry your town so small and poor as this ? You shame yourselves by such a sum ! " Thus courteously he would force their sum upward , and he never threatened them coarsely as some lords of war do and cry out that he would set his soldiers free in the town if he did not get so much and so much . No , Wang the Tiger used only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must live too and they ought not to be asked for more than in reason they ought to be able to give . And the end of it and the fruit of his courtesy was that he had that for which he asked and the merchants were glad to be rid of him so easily and rid of his horde . Thus Wang the Tiger marched his men to the southeast where the sea was and each time he stopped in a town he had a sum of money the merchants gave him and at dawn he went on and the people were glad . But in poor hamlets or small villages Wang the Tiger did not ask for anything unless it were a little food , and the least he could take . Seven days and seven nights did Wang the Tiger thus lead his men and at the end of those days he was even somewhat enriched by the sums of money he had had , and his men were all in great high heart and well fed and very hopeful . At the end of the seven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city he planned to take as the heart to this whole region and he rode to a low hill from where he could see it . There that city lay like a treasure encircled by its wall , and set into the rolling green fields , and Wang the Tiger 's heart leaped to see it so beautiful and under so fair a sky . There the river ran also , as he had heard it did , and the south gate of the city touched the river , so the city seemed like a jewel hung upon a silver chain . In greatest haste then did Wang the Tiger send his messengers to that city guarded with a thousand men , and he declared to the lord of war who held that city that he who was Wang the Tiger had come down out of the north and he came to save the people from a robber and if the robber would not withdraw peacefully and for a sum to be named then must Wang the Tiger march against the city with his tens of thousands upon thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place was a very doughty old robber and he was so black and hideous a man that the people had nick- him after the fearful black god who stands in the entrance of temples to be guardian there , so the lord of war was called the Gate God . When he heard the boldness of this message thatthe Tiger had sent he fell into a mighty rage and he bellowed his wrath awhile before he could give an answer , and when he d , he answered thus : ' o back and tell your master that he may fight if he wishes . Who him ? I have never heard of this little dog who calls himself ling the Tiger ! " The messengers returned then and repeated this faithfully to WangTiger and he was mightily angry in his turn and he was secretly rt that the lord of war said he had never heard the name of WangTiger , and he wondered within himself if he were less than he tight . But outwardly he ground his teeth together in his black beardd he called to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encamped themselves all about it . But the gates were locked ainst them so that they could not go in , and Wang the Tiger bade a men quarter themselves until dawn , and he had a row of tents t up around the city moat so that his men could watch to see what enemy did and bring him the news . Now at dawn Wang the Tiger rose very early and he roused his guard and all his men were called by the blowing of bugles and drums and when they were assembled Wang the Tiger gave his commands that they were to be ready for battle when he called , even though it might be that they waited for a month or two . Then with his guard he went to a hill that was to the east of the city and there was an old pagoda there and he climbed up into it and his men he left below to guard him and to terrify the few old priests that were in a temple there , and he saw that while the city was not large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , still the houses were well built and the roofs were of a dark tile and piled upon each other like scales upon a fish 's back . He went down then and back to his men and he led them across the moat , but as he did so , a shower of shots dropped from the high city wall , and Wang the Tiger withdrew again in haste . Wang the Tiger could do no more then but wait , and he took counsel with his captains and these counselled a siege , for a siege is surer than a battle , since people must eat . This seemed a good thing to Wang the Tiger also , because his men must of a certainty be killed if he attacked the city now , and the gates were so strong , and the great beams so joined together with plates of iron , that Wang the Tiger did not know how to prevail against them . Moreover , if they guarded the locked gates so that no food could go in day after day , after a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas if they fought now- the enemy would be strong and well fed ,   and it could not be said certainly where the victory would turn . Thais Wang the Tiger reasoned and it seemed to him the better thing to wait until he could do battle and be sure of victory . Therefore he ordered his soldiers to guard that whole city wall , but to stand back from it far enough so that shots could not reach them but would fall harmlessly into the moat . The soldiers did so encircle the walls and no one could come out or go in , and the soldiers fed c n the produce of the land about there and they ate the fowls and the vegetables and the fruits and the grains that the farmers had , anal since they paid something for all they took , the farmers did not join against them , and Wang the Tiger 's army fared very well . The summercame on in its season and the land was good and the season was prosperous , for it was in these parts a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west no rains had fallen behind the mountains and there would be famine in that place . When Wang the Tiger heard this , he said to himself that again his good destiny was over him and that there was plenty here for him . Thus a month passed and more and Wang the Tiger waited day after day in his tent and no one came out of that locked city . And he waited twenty more days and he grew very impatient and so did his men also , but the foe was doughty still , and if they went across the moat shots still popped out from the city wall . Wang the Tiger wonderedvery much and he said in his anger , " What can they have left to eat that anyone has yet the strength to hold his weapon ? " And the Hawk , who stood by , spat in admiration of so good and brave an enemy and wiping his mouth on his hand he said , " They must by now have eaten the dogs and the cats and the beasts of every kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thus the days passed and there came no sign out of the besieged city until the end of the second month of summer . Then as Wang the Tiger went out one morning as he did every day to see if there were any smallest change , he saw a white flag waved above the north gate where he was encamped . And in great haste and excitement he bade a man of his raise a white flag , too , and he exulted for he thought the end was come . Then the north gate opened a little , and only wide enough to let one man through and it was shut and they could hear the scraping of the iron bars . And Wang the Tiger watched breathless on the other side of the moat where his camp was , and he saw a young man walkingslowly toward him , carrying a white flag upon a bamboo pole . Then Wang the Tiger called to his men to stand in line , and he tookP221place and just behind and they waited for the man , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I come to talk of peace and we will pay you a sum and all we have ti will go away in peace . " en Wang the Tiger laughed his noiseless laugh and he said , ring , o you think I have come so far for money alone ? I can get money y own regions . No ! Your lord of war must surrender to me for I need this city and this region and it shall be part of my own . " when the young man leaned upon his pole and he looked at Wang Tiger with a look of death and he entreated , saying , ave mercy and take your men away ! " And he fell on his face re Wang the Tiger. but Wang the Tiger felt his anger begin to creep up in him as he ays did when he was opposed and he was roused and he shouted , I will never go away until the land is mine ! " hen the young man rose and he threw back his head proudly and said , ' hen stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear it ! " and with-t another word he turned back toward the gate . Then Wang the Tiger felt his old black anger come up in him and e said to himself that he was amazed that an importunate enemy should send so discourteous a messenger , who had not even performed any rites of courtesy , and to himself he thought that this was the most impudent young man he had ever seen , and the more he thought the more angry he grew and suddenly and before he knew it clearly himself he was furious and he called to a soldier , " Lift me your gun and shoot that fellow ! " The soldier obeyed instantly and he shot very well for the young man fell face down upon a narrow bridge that crossed the moat and his flag fell into the water and the pole floated idly upon the surface of the moat and the whiteness of the flag was sullied with the muddy stream . Then Wang the Tiger commanded his men to run forward Ind fetch the young man , and they did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not one did come , and Wang the Tiger marvelled a little and wondered what this might mean . But he wonderedstill more when the young man lay before him dead and fast turning the hue of death , for this young man was not starving at all . No , when Wang the Tiger ordered his clothes to be stripped from him co that he might see his flesh , there the young man lay , not fat but still filled out well so that it could be seen he had been fed with something . Then was Wang the Tiger somewhat dashed at the sight and he was discouraged for the moment and he cried ,   " If this fellow is as fat as he is , what have they to eat that they can last so well against me ? " And he cursed and said , " Well , and I can spend my life at this as well as they can ! " Because he was so angry from this day he commanded his soldiers to make themselves easy and to take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or goods from the people in the suburbs about that city or from farming folk here and there , he did not stop them as he once would have , and when a farmer came to complain or any came to swear against a soldier that he had come into a private house and done what he should not , Wang the Tiger said sullenly , " " You are an accursed lot , you people , and I believe you are sending food secretly into this city or else how can they be so long fed ? " But the farmers swore they were not and many times one would say piteously , " What do we care what lord is over us , and do you think we love this old robber who has kept us half starved with his taxes ? Sir , if you will only treat us with mercy and keep your men back from evil , we will even be glad to have you in his place . " But Wang the Tiger grew surly as the summer wore on , and he cursed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles of filth the many soldiers must make , and the mosquitoes that came out of the stagnant moat , and he thought with impatience of the city where his own courts were and where his two wives waited for him , and all his anger made him not so kind as he had been and his men grew very lawless and he let them be so . There came one night in the time of the great heat , a very hot bright moonlight night and Wang the Tiger walked outside his tent for coolness , for he could not sleep . He walked alone except for his bodyguard who strolled yawning and half asleep behind him as he walked to and fro . And Wang stared as he ever did at the walls of the city and they stood high and black in the moonlight and it seemed unconquerableto him . And as he stared he grew very angry again , and indeed his anger was never cooled in these days , and he swore to himselfvery bitterly that he would make every man and woman and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this war he was waging . At that moment he saw a moving spot upon the blackness of the wall , a spot more black and moving downward . He stared and stood still . At first he could not believe he saw it but the longer he stood and stared the more he could see that there was something small and dark moving like a crab among the vines and the dry small trees that clung to that old wall . At last he saw that it was a man . Yes , the man reached the bottom and he dropped and came out into the moonlight and Wang the Tiger saw that he waved a white cloth . Then Wang the Tiger commanded that one go to meet him bear/a white flag also , and he commanded that the man be brought to and he stood and waited there and he strained his sight to see this man was . When the man was come he threw himself at g the Tiger 's feet and beat his head on the ground to beg for . But Wang the Tiger shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! " wo soldiers came forward then and lifted the man and Wang the r stared and as he stared he grew so angry that he felt a thickness is throat , for this man was not yet starved . No , gaunt he was and thin and black , but he was not starved and Wang the Tiger bel-Are you come to surrender the city ? " And the man said , " No , the chief will not surrender yet for he stillfood , and we who are about him have some food given us every . The people starve , it is true , but we can let them , and we are il ( e to hold out yet awhile and we hope for help from the south for pc have let a man over the wall secretly to go for it . " At this Wang the Tiger felt very insecure and he said doubtfully , ! ding back his anger as best he could , " Why have you come if not to surrender ? " And the man said sullenly , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under whom I serve has used me very ill . Yes , he is only ase and hateful creature , wild and untutored , and I am a man of ( gentle blood . My father was even a scholar and I am used to courtesy . I le has put me to great shame before my own soldiers . Now a man may forgive much , but he can never forgive being put to shame and a is insult not only to me but to my ancestors for whom I stand in these times , and his ancestors were , if he knows them at all , such as would be held serfs by mine . " " But how could he put you to such shame as this ? " asked Wang the Tiger , and he was secretly much astonished at this turn . And the man answered with a sullen passion , " He belittled me for the way I held my gun and this is my greatest skill and I can fell what I aim for without a miss . " Then a light began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that laughter and belittling can breed the bitterest hatred in a man 's heart even against a friend , and a man will do anything for revenge if shame is put on him , especially if he be a high proud fellow such as this man was in his looks . And Wang the Tiger said plainly , " Tell me what your price is . " Then the man looked about him and here were the soldiers of Wang the Tiger 's bodyguard , listening and their mouths ajar , and he bent and whispered , " Let me go into your tent with you where I can speak out . "   Then Wang the Tiger turned and strode into his tent and he manded the man to be brought there and he left no more sot with him than five or six or so to guard against possible treachery f this man . But there was no treachery in this one , only revenge , so Wang the Tiger found , for the man said , " I am so filled with hatred and rage that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you and I ask only one t that you will take me under your own banners and the few men follow me whom I do not hate , and protect us , lest if the robber is killed , I shall be sought for and killed , for he is a bitter enemy . " But Wang the Tiger would not have such generous help free unrewarded with no more than this , and so he said , looking hard the man as he stood before him between the two soldiers who him , " You are a very proper man not to bear insult and no good fcl will . I am glad to have so good and brave a man with me . Go ha then , and tell your fellows and all the soldiers that I will take the under my own banners , all who surrender themselves and their gn and not one of them shall be killed . As for you , you shall be a capta in my army , and I will give you two hundred pieces of silver and fi pieces to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then the man 's twisted face lightened and he cried warmly , " Y are such a general as I have been searching for all my life long , and I will surely open the gate to you at the moment when the sun is at its zenith on this very day now dawning ! " With this the man turned abruptly and went back and Wang the Tiger rose and went out of his tent and watched the man as he climbed nimbly and skilfully over the wall , catching hold of the roots and t ht gnarled trees as a monkey might , and so he climbed and disappeared over the wall . By now the sun rose like a copper rim over the edge of the fields and Wang the Tiger commanded his men to be roused but quietly and without any noise lest some enemy see a commotion and suspect a new plan . But many of the men knew already that one had come out of the city and they had risen in the night and made ready withoutlighting a single torch . And indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was like a pale sun and the men could see such things even as how their triggers were set and where a string should pass through the eyelet of a shoe . By full sunrise every man was in his place and Wang the Tiger gave orders that to each meat should be given to eat and a full deep drink of wine to make his heart warm and brave , and thus fed and comforted the soldiers waited for the drum to beat that would send them forward . P225is as the sun rose high and full and beat down with a breathless upon the plain where the city lay , Wang the Tiger shouted from he stood and his men gathered as they had been told to do in lines and when they heard their general shout every man also , and the noise ran like an echo among them . And as they every man lifted his weapon in his hands , each man a gun knife , and they all ran forward . Some crossed the moat by the but many ran across the shallow moat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city wall and clusaboutthe north gate . But the captains would not let Wang the stand too near the front , for they did not know at this last mowhetherthe man would be true or not or whether there would be treachery . Yet Wang the Tiger trusted the man because he knew revenge is the surest sort of hatred. us they waited , and not a sound came out of that city , and there Do sound of guns upon the city wall . Then as the sun swung upintoits place in the zenith , Wang the Tiger stood stiff and watching , and he saw that great iron gate swing a little and one stooped peered and there was a little crack of light along its top . He shouted once , and they rushed forward and Wang the Tiger with and they pressed against the gate and burst it wide and they red into the streets of that city like water freed from a dam , and siege was ended . Then Wang the Tiger did not stand a moment , but he commanded be led instantly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toted and roared at his men that they were not free yet and not unhehad found the old chief . Then swiftly because of the haste of it greed his men hurried him to that palace , asking as they wentlaying ruthless hold on any terrified man they saw . But when Wang the Tiger entered the courts of that palace with a great flourish drums and bugles it was empty , for the robber chief had fled . How had known of the betrayal could not be said , but as Wang the Tiger 's men had poured into the north gate the old robber and his loyal followers escaped out of the south gate and were fleeing across the countryside . Wang the Tiger hearing this from soldiers who had nit gone with him rushed upon the south wall of the city and looked wit and far in the distance he could see but a flying cloud of dust . He was in two minds for a while whether or not to pursue it , but it came ti him that he had what he wanted and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did a robber and his few men mean ? So he went down then and back into the deserted palace , and there the many soldiers of the enemy who were left came to do obeisance and to beg his protection . He was pleased to see their number , for theyP226came to him as he sat in the chief hall , and they came in tens and in twenties , the thinnest , most haggard men he had ever seen except in famine years . But they had their weapons and when they knelt before him and held out their hands to show their submission , Wang the Tiger accepted them and ordered that every man be fed as much as he was able to eat and that he be given five pieces of silver . But when the man who had betrayed the robber chief came in at the head of his company Wang the Tiger gave him the two hundred pieces of silver he had promised him and he gave it with his own hands and he commanded that captain 's garb be brought and given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember what the man had done for him , and he rewarded him and took him into his own ranks . When this was all finished then Wang the Tiger knew that the time had come when he must redeem his promise to his men , for he had held them as long as he could and they would not be longer held . And Wang the Tiger gave the command for their freedom , wishing he need not while he did . It was a strange thing that now that he had what he wanted his anger against the people was gone , and he shrank from making them suffer . Yet he must keep his word , too , to his men , and when he had given them their freedom for three days he shut himself into the palace and closed the gates and he was alone except for his bodyguard . Yet even these hundred men or so were very restless and demanded their turn , and at last Wang the Tiger had to tell them off and call others back in their place , and when these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their faces dark and flushed so that they could not subdue their wild looks , Wang the Tiger turned his eyes away and he would not think of what was going on in that city . When his nephew , whom he kept always by him , grew curious to go out and see what was to be seen , Wang the Tiger burst out on him , glad of one on whom he could with reason fix his anger , and he roared , " Shall my own blood go ravening out like these coarse and common men ? " And he would not let the young man move out of his sight , and kept him busy about his person fetching this or that to eat or to drink or some change he must have in his garments , and when weak cries came through even into the fast closed courts , Wang the Tiger was more imperious and more angry than ever with his nephew , so that the youth was kept all in a sweat with his uncle 's temper , and he did not dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanger the Tiger could not be cruel unless he was angry , and ' indeed this was a weakness in a lord of war that he could only kill in anger , whose means to glory is death , and he knew it was his weakness that he could not kill coldly or carelessly or for ap227cause . And he thought it weakness that he could not keep his anger against the people and he told himself he ought still to hate themause they had been so dull and stubborn and had not thought of ay to open the gates to him . Yet when his soldiers came sheepishlyask for their food , he cried at them in a confusion of fury and pain , " What , must I feed you even when you loot ? " To this they made answer , " There is not a handful of grain in this whole city and we can not eat gold and silver and silks . These we find but no food , for the farmers are still afraid to come in with their pro-duce . " And Wang the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said was true and he could not but order them fed , although when he did , he shouted in his surliest tones . But once he heard a hearty rude fellow cry coarsely , " Yes , and the wenches are all so thin they are liked plucked fowls and there is no pleasure in them at all ! " Then suddenly Wang the Tiger could not bear his life and he went away into a room by himself and he sat and groaned for a while before he could harden himself again . But he did harden himself once more . He thought of the fair lands and he thought how he had enlargedhis power and how he had in this war more than doubled the country over which he ruled , and he told himself that it was his trade and his means of greatness and last and best he thought of the two women he had and how from one of them surely his son would be born , and he cried to his own heart , " Can not I for that one bear that others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hardened himself for the three days and he held himself to his promised word . But on the dawn of the fourth day he rose up early from his restless bed and he ordered signals given and horns blown everywhere and it was a sign to all his soldiers that their looting was over and they must come back to his commands . And because he rose up that morning more than usually fierce and black in his , looks and his black brows darted up and down over his eyes , none dared to disobey him . No , none except one . As Wang the Tiger strode out of the gate that had been fast locked these three days he heard a feeble crying in an alley near by , and being made oversensitive to these cries now , he turned his long steps there to see what it was . In that alley he saw a soldier of his on his way back to the ranks , but he had seen an old woman pass and on her finger was a thin , gold ring , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old woman was only some working wife , and she could not have any great good thing . But the soldier had beenP228overcome with a sudden desire for the last bit of gold and he wrenched at the old woman 's hand and she cried out at him , wailing , " It has been on my finger nigh upon thirty years and how can I loose it now ? " And the soldier was in such haste , for the bugle was blowing , that there before his own eyes Wang the Tiger saw the man whip out his knife and cut off the old woman 's finger clean , and her poor scanty blood had still strength enough to spurt out in a feeble stream . Then Wang the Tiger gave a great roaring curse , for the soldier had not seen him he was in such haste , and Wang the Tiger sprang at tire soldier and he drew out his keen blade as he sprang and drove it straight through the man 's body . Yes , although it was his own man Wang the Tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to sec this wretched , starved creature dealt with as she had been before his very eyes . The soldier fell without a sigh and his own blood gushed out in a hearty , red stream . As for the old woman she was terrified at such fierceness , even if it was to succor her , and she wrapped her smarting stump in her old apron and ran and hid herself somewhere and Wang the Tiger did not see her again . He wiped his sword on the soldier 's coat , then , and he turned away lest he repent what he had done , and it was useless to repent , since the man was dead . He stayed only to command one of his guards to take the dead man 's gun . Then Wang the Tiger went through that city and he was astonished beyond any measure to see the few wretched people there were and how they came crawling out into their doorways and sat listless on the benches upon their thresholds , too weak to lift their heads even to look at Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine of autumn , and his guards glittering and clattering behind him . No , they sat there as though they were dead , so dull and still they were , and some strange shame and astonishment was in Wang the Tiger 's heart so that he did not stay to talk with any man . He held his head very high and he pretended he did not see the people and only the shops . There were many goods in these shops such as he had not seen before , since this city was on the river to the south , and the river ran to the sea , and such goods could be brought in . Yes , Wang the Tiger saw many curious foreign things he had not seen before , but they were carelessly placed now and covered with dust as though no one had come to buy for a long time . But two things he did not see in this city . He saw no food anywhere for sale , and the market place was empty and silent and there were no vendors or hucksters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , and he saw no little children . At first he did not notice how quiet the streets were and then he noticed and wondered for the reason ofp229quietness and then it came to him that he missed the noisy voices laughter of the children with which every house is filled in usual s , and he missed their darting and running upon the streets . Anddcnly he could not bear to look at the thin dark dull faces of the and women who were left . He had done no more than any lord war may do , and it could not be counted to him for a crime , sincee was no other way in which he could rise. but Wang the Tiger was truly too merciful a man for his trade and turned and went back to his courts because he could not bear to this city now his , and he was cast down and ill humored and he c at his soldiers and he roared at them to be out of his way , for could not endure at all the sound of their loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he looked with ragen the gold rings they had on their fingers and the foreign watches had hung on them and many such things they had taken . Yes , even saw gold rings on the fingers of his two trusty men , upon the wk 's hard hand a ring of gold , and a jade ring upon the thumb the Pig Butcher , that was so large and coarse a thumb the ring k half way upon the joint and would go no further . But still he c it so . Seeing all this Wang the Tiger felt very far and separateall these men and muttered to himself that they were low and t-like fellows and he was lonely to the depths of his being and he t and sat alone in his room in mighty ill humor and bellowed for smallest cause if anyone came near him. ut when he had sat thus a day or two and his soldiers , seeing how ry he was , were frightened and calmed themselves somewhat , Wang the Tiger hardened himself once more and he told himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of life and even had destined him as he was , and he must finish what he had begun . So he rose and washed himself , for he had sat these three days washed and unshaven , he was so angry , and he clothed himself slily , and he sent a messenger to the magistrate of the city that he just come and submit himself . Then Wang the Tiger went into thesliest hall of this palace and sat down there and waited for the manto come . In an hour or two the magistrate came with what haste he could aster and he came in leaning on two men , a very ghastly , pale figure a man he looked . But he bowed to Wang the Tiger and waited andWang the Tiger saw this man was well born and a scholar by his title looks . He rose therefore and bowed in return and he motioned t the magistrate was to be seated . Then Wang the Tiger was seatedand he could but sit and stare at this other , for the magistrate 's e and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it as the hue of a liver that has been dried for a day or two , and he was so thin one would have said his skin was glued to his bones . Then Wang the Tiger cried out suddenly in the midst of his won . derment , " Whatdid you starve too ? " And the man answered simply , " Yes , since my people did also , and it is not the first time . " " But the man they sent out to make truce the first time was fed well enough , " said Wang the Tiger . " Yes , but they fed him specially from the first , " answered the magistrate , " so that if you would not make truce you would see they had stores left to eat and could hold out longer . " Then Wang the Tiger could not but approve such good guile as this and he cried out in wonder and admiration of it , and he said , " But the captain who came out was well fed , too ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the last the best they could . But the people starved and many hundreds of them are dead . All the weak and the very old and the young are dead . " And Wang the Tiger heaved a sigh and said , " It is true I saw no babes anywhere . " And he stared awhile at the magistrate and then he forced himself to say what he must and he said , " Submit yourself to me now , for I have won the right to take that other lord of war 's place over you and over this whole region over which he ruled . I am the ruler now and I add this to my dominion I have already to the north . The revenues shall come into my hand now , and I will demand of you a certain sum fixed and beyond that a proportion of revenues every month . " This Wang the Tiger said with some few courteous words afterwards , for he was not devoid of such courtesy . The magistrate answered in his weak and hollow voice , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white for his drawn mouth , " We are in your power . Only give us a month or two to recover ourselves . " Then he waited awhile and he said again with great bitterness , " What is it to us who rules over us if we can only have peace and if we can only pursue our business and have a livelihood and nurtureour children ? I swear I and my people are willing to pay you in all reason if you will only be strong enough to keep off other lords of war and let us live secure in our generation . " This was all Wang the Tiger cared to know , and now his merciful heart smote him to hear the man 's feeble , breathy voice and he cried out to his soldiers , " Bring in food and wine and feed him and the men with him ! " And when he had seen this done , he called his trusty men to him and he commanded again , " Go out now into the countryside and take soldiersand compel the farmers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people may buy and eat and recover themselves again after this very bitter war . " So did Wang the Tiger show his justice to all the people and the magistrate thanked him , and he was moved with his gratitude . Then Wang the Tiger saw how courteous and gently born and reared this magistrate was for even half starved as he was and his eyes glittered at the food that was set on a table before him , he restrained himself and he dallied and delayed , his trembling hands clasped tightly to- together , until all the polite and courteous things were said that should c said from guest to host and until Wang the Tiger could seat himself in the host 's place . Then the poor man fell upon the food , and still he tried to hold himself back and in very pity Wang the Tiger at last made excuse that he had some affair to which he must go . He went away then and let the man eat alone , for his underlings ate separately , and afterwards Wang the Tiger heard his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing , so clean the starving men had licked them . Then Wang the Tiger took the sweetest pleasure in seeing the marketsof that city fill again and in seeing the food begin to lie in vendors ' baskets along the sides of the streets and on the counters , and he thought he could see day by day that men and women grew fatter and the dark livid hue left their faces and they won back their clear and golden color of health . All through the winter Wang the Tiger lived in that city , arranging for his revenues and shaping affairs anew , and he rejoiced when children began to be born and women suckled babes again , and the sight stirred some deep in his own heart that he did not understand , except that a longing fell- on him to return to his own courts and for the first time he wondered concerning his own two women . And he planned to return to his own house at the end of that year . Now when Wang the Tiger had finished his siege of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to him and told him that there was a great war waging between north and south and again they came and said the north had won that war once more . Then Wang the Tiger made haste and he sent a band of men bearing gifts of silver and of silks and he wrote a letter to the general of the province . This letter Wang the Tiger wrote himself , for he was a little vain of his learning , since few lords of war are learned , and he set on it his own great red seal that he had now he was grown great . In the letter he told how he had fought against a southern general and had defeated him and had taken this region that ran by this river for the north . Then the general sent back a very good answer , full of praise for Wang the Tiger 's success , and he gave him a very fine new title , and all he asked was that a certain sum be sent him every year for the pro- vincial army . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong enough yet to refuse , promised the sum , and thus he established himself in the state . As the end of the year drew near and Wang the Tiger took stock of his position , he found he had more than doubled his territories , and except for the mountainous parts which were bare , the lands were good and fertile producing both wheat and rice in measure , and besidesthis , salt and oils of peanuts and sesame and beans . Now , moreover , he had his own way to the sea and he could bring in much he needed and he could be free of Wang the Merchant his brother , when he wanted guns . For Wang the Tiger longed very much to have great foreign guns , and the longing came to him especially because among the things the old robber chief had left were two very strange , huge guns such as Wang the Tiger had never seen before . They were of a very good iron without bubbles or holes of any sort in it , and so smooth that some clever ironsmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , so heavy that more than twenty men must put forth their utmost strength to lift them up at all . And Wang the Tiger was very curious about these guns and he longed to see how to fire them , but no one knew how to do it , nor could they find any bullets for them . But at last two round iron balls were found hid in an old storehouse , and it came to Wang the Tiger that these were for the great guns , and he was in great delight and he had one of the guns taken out into an open spot in front of an old temple which had a waste place behind it . At first no one would come forward to try the gun , but Wang the Tiger offered a very good rewardof silver , and at last the captain who had betrayed the city came forward , wanting the reward and hoping to gain favor , and he had seen the guns fired once , and he set all in readiness and very cleverly he fastened a torch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gun from a distance . When they saw the smoke begin they all ran a long way off and waited , and the gun blew off its great charge and the earth shook and the very heavens roared and smoke and fire streamed out , so that even Wang the Tiger was staggered and his heart stopped for an instant 's fear . But when it was over they all looked and there the old temple lay in a heap of dusty ruins . Then Wang the Tiger laughed his noiseless laugh , and he was struck with delight at so good a toy as this and so fine a weapon of war , and he cried out , " If I had had a gun like this there would have been no siege for I would have blown the city gates in ! " And he thought a moment and he asked the captain , " But why did not your old chief turn them upon us ? " To this the captain said , " We did not think of it . These two gunsP233captured from anothner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yy were brought here but never fired , and we did not know these le were here and we did not think of these guns as weapons at all , long they have stood here in the entrance court . " ) lint Wang the Tiger treasured these great guns very much and he nned he would buy more balls for them and he had them brought 1 set where he could often see them . When he had taken stock of all he had done , Wang the Tiger was l pleased with himself and he prepared to return to his home . Hea good large army in that city led by his own old men , and the west men and the new captain he took back with him . After someBering , he left in highest command in this city two whom he Id trust . He left the Hawk and he left his nephew , who was grown w into a goodly young man , not tall but broad and strong and not to look at except for his pocked face which would be marred like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed to Wang the Tiger good pair to leave , for the young man was too young to take comndalone , and the Hawk could not be wholly trusted . So Wang theer set them together and he told the young man secretly , " If you believe he thinks of any treachery , send a messenger to me wings by night and by day . " The youth promised , his eyes merry with his joy to be lifted up so h and left alone , and Wang the Tiger could go and be at ease , for man can trust those of his own blood . Then having done all well 1d made all secure , Wang the Tiger returned victorious to his own me . As for the people of that city they set themselves steadfastly again to ild up once more what had been destroyed . Once more they filled their shops and set to work their looms to make silk and cotton cloths , d they bought and sold and they never talked except of such reveal , for what was passed , had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE TIGER made haste on his homeward journey , although he said it was to see if his army were peaceful as he had left it . And he truly thought this was the chief reason , for he did not understand himself that he made haste for a deeper cause than this and it was to see if he had any son born to him or not . He had been away from his house close upon ten months out of a year , and although he had twice received letters from his learned wife in that time they were such very proper letters and full of s respect , that the sheet was full of these words , and little else except that all was well enough . But the moment he stepped into his own courts triumphantly , saw at a glance that Heaven was over him still and his good destiny still held , for there in the sunny court , where the south sun slu warm and there was no wind , sat his two wives , and each held babe , and each babe was dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doddering little heads were crownless scarlet caps . The unlearned , wife had sewed a row of small gold Buddhas upon her child 's c but the learned wife , because she was so learned , did not believe these tokens of good fortune , and she had embroidered flowers ul her child 's cap . Except for this , there seemed no difference in the p of children , and Wang the Tiger blinked at them amazed , for he h not thought of two . He stammered out , " Whatwhat " Then the learned wife rose , for she was quick and graceful in spe and she spoke prettily always , very smoothly and throwing in a- learn phrase or a line from some old poem or classic , and she made a show of her shining white teeth as she spoke , and she said , smiling , " These are the babes we have borne for you while you were away , and they are strong and sound from head to foot , " and she held up her own for Wang the Tiger to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back that she had borne a son , for the learned wife 's was a daughter , and she rose too and made haste to say , although she spoke seldom because of her blackened teeth and the gaps where she had none , and now she held her lips close and she said , " Mine is the son , my lord , and the other is a girl . " But Wang the Tiger said nothing at all . Indeed he could not speak for he had not known all it would be to have something of his own making belong to him like this . He stood and stared for a while speechless at these two minute creatures who seemed not to see him at all . No , they looked placidly at him as though he had always been there like a tree or a bit of the wall . They winked and blinked at the sunlight and the boy sneezed overloudly for his size so that Wang the Tiger was yet more astonished at such a gust coming out of so small a fragment . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , and yawned very widely , and her father stared at her while she did . He had never held a child in his arms , and he did not touch these two . Nor did he know what to say to these two women at such a time , seeing that his speech had always been of warlike things . He could only smile somewhat fixedly , therefore , even while the men who were with him exclaimed in joy and admiration at thep235their general had , and when he heard these exclamations he muttered out of his deep pleasure , ell , and I suppose women will breed ! " and he went hastily intoapartments , being too full of joy for his own comfort . There he washed and ate and he changed his stiff garments of wara silk robe of a deep dark blue , and when it was all finished itevening . Then he sat down by the brazier of coals , for the night me on quiet and chill with frost and there Wang the Tiger sat ne and reflected on all that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at every point , and so ored there was nothing to which he could not attain . Now that hed a son his ambition took on meaning and what he did , he dida purpose . As he thought his heart swelled in him , and he forgot cry sorrow and loneliness he ever had , and he shouted suddenly intoe stillness of the room , " I will make a true warrior out of that son of mine ! " and he rose and slapped his hand against his thigh in his pleasure . He strode about the room then for a while , smiling without knowing he did , and he thought what a comfortable thing it was to have a son of his own , and he thought how now he need depend no more on his brothers ' sons , for there was his own son to continue his life after him and to increase his domains of war . Then another thought came to him and it was that he also had a daughter . He spent a little time then wondering what he would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fingered the hairs of his beard , and thought of his daughter with reticence because she was a girl and at last he said to himself in some doubt , " I suppose I can wed her to some good warrior when the time comes , and it is all that I can do for her . " From this day on Wang the Tiger saw a new purpose in those two women of his , for from them he saw springing yet more sons , true and loyal sons who would never betray him as might another who had not his own blood in him . No longer did he use those two women to free his own heart and flesh . His heart was freed at the first sight of his son , and of his flesh he hoped for his sons , trusty soldiers to stand beside him and support him when he grew old and weak . So he went regularly to his two wives , and not more to one than the other , for all their secret gentle striving for his favor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way , for he sought from them equally but the one thing , and he did not hope for more from the one than from the other . It troubled him no more that he did not love a woman , now that he had his son . Thus the winter passed in content . The New Year festival **25;1217;TOOLONG surface . A party ! Was n't it wonderful to be going to a grown-up party at last ? Only she wished her mother had let her have a new dress . She was sure Bena would be dressed very fine . But her mother said Bena was so short and pudgy that nobody ever saw what she wore . Well , no matter , she was going to see the Birdsongs waltz together . Perhaps , when she grew up , she might waltz as beautifully as Mrs. Birdsong ! Oh , how she wished she might stay up all night ! Were n't parties too lovely ? She was wearing her prettiest blue sash and blue hair-ribbons ; she was going to a real party for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret that nobodysuspected . Immediately , the bright fish dived far below , and the current of life rippled and broke into waves and scattered a sparkling spray through her thoughts . " I 'm alive , alive , alive , and I 'm Jenny Blair Archbald 1 " And beside her , the General was thinking , while this current of life paled and darkened and flowed on more quietly , " I hope Etta wo n't insist on staying too late . Why should she , poor girl , when she 'll probably sit against the wall the whole evening ? But parties are n't so gay as they used to be , and women , with the exception of Eva Birdsong , are not what they were in my youth . Or perhaps it is because my arteries are not all that they used to be . God knows how I shall be able to keep awake until midnight , especially if Bob Peyton insists on my drinking a glass of port . Keeping awake after ten o'clock is the hardest thing . Even when I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscionable hour before daybreak . Getting old ! That is the worst of life , getting old . Especially when you grow old without having had what you wanted . But it requires courage to take what you want in this world , and most people lack courage . " Yet courage alone , he saw presently , was not sufficient . For courage , as well as cowardice , may trust in false valueseven in evasive idealism . Great-aunt Sabina had had the rashness of infidelitythough he had always suspected that she had defied her Creator only in the days of her youth , and had returned to Divine mercy when age fastened upon her . Then poor Rodney had had the courage of despair at the end ; and Margaret ( the old pang still throbbed at the thought of her ) had summoned up whatever spirit was required for her desperate adventure . These were ghosts . These were unquiet ghostsbut Isabella . Would Isabella have the courage not only to will but to act ? They thought he had perceived nothing , that his old eyes were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he was sharper than they imagined . Almost from the first he had seen the way things were tending , and he had felt , in spite of his disapproval , an obscure satisfaction . " I 'd like to see her pay back Thomas in his own coin . I 'd like to see her pay back that cad . But it would n't do . It would n't do , though , God knows , the Archbalds have lived down many worse disgraces than overalls in the family . " He chuckled under his breath . " After witchcraft , adultery , and murder ( for Uncle Percivalhad killed his man in a duel ) , it seems an anti-P102climax to make a fuss about overalls . " No , it would n't do in a woman , not even to pay back Thomas , who was beginning again , Cora said , to cast sheep 's eyes at Isabellain church . A man with red blood in his veins would commit any folly for a girl as handsome as Josephbut it would n't do in a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told himself , " not that I should n't help her to put a bold face on the matter . " This was wild dreaming , he knew , the kind of dreamingone would never acknowledge when it was over ; yet even while he admitted that it was wild , he continued to indulge in his dreams . After all , class consciousness , like his arteries , was not all that it used to be . Like every other superstition , he supposed , it was doomed to decay . Perhaps new blood , new passions , and new social taboos were the only salvation of a dying order . Make Joseph a master builder , he mused idly , put him in the right clothes , andbut , no , it would n't do in a woman . It would n't do for a girl like Isabella to marry out of her class . Especially , it would n't do for her to run away as poor Margaret had done . The husks of his mind closed on the thought that it would not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his being some dark impulse was appeased by the imagined flight of his daughter . Some dark impulse , perpetually thwarted and denied , was appeasedYes , he was good for one more fight , though he must never let Isabella suspect that he sympathized with her folly . The family would disapprove , but he could rely on the clan loyalty . All the old families that wereP103not rotten within would close round him , just as they would close round him if he had forged a cheque or murdered his uncle . Cora , of course , would fall in with them . Without admitting the difference in station , she would contrive ingeniously to explain it away . Plain people would become quiet people . His chuckle was slightly sardonic as her cheerful tones rang in his thoughts . " Yes , the Crockers have always been quiet people . Baptists are so devout . Not that Joseph has ever had much religion " Which was a step at least in theright direction of the Episcopal Church Drowsinessslipped into his mind ; and beneath the thin veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily , he felt the current of life flow on into the cloudless area of youth and delight . " Oh , how lovely it is ! " Jenny Blair was exclaiming . " Look at the lawn hung with lanterns ! Look at the open door filled with coloured lights ! Oh , how I wish life could be all parties ! " Then welling up , sinking , spilling , going suddenly flat , the current of life sighed faintly through the loosened texture of Etta 's mind . " I wonder if the curl is out of my hair . How I hope somebody will ask me to dance ! I wish I 'd put a little more red on my cheeks . Under those coloured lanterns nobody would know . If Margaret is in the dressing-room , I will make her speak to me . She has never been near me since I bit her arm that eveninguntil she cried . But it was only in play . I did n't know it would hurt her like that . Anyhow , I wish I were dead.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to parties with an old man and a little girl ? Oh , they have Chinese lanterns down in the garden ! Does n't it look just like fairyland ? Would n't it be too wonderful if somebody I 'd never met were to fall in love with me to-night for the sake of my sweet expression ? Men have done that before . It has happened to Isabella , only she has n't a sweet expression now , and last spring it happened to Daisy Bellowsbut --  Oh , I know nothing will ever happen to me , and I wish I were dead ! "  | " I KNOW something ! I know something ! " Bena cried , whirling round on her plump legs in a frock of pink organdie . She had a fair , expressionless face , with skin like an egg-shell , and was called a pretty little girl by persons who had never looked at her closely . Her thin , silken hair was tied on the top of her head with a bow of pink ribbon , and her short arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know something you do n't ! " she repeated hilariously , breaking into the Highland Fling , not because she must , but from pure rapture . Though Bena was a valuable friend , as Mrs. Archbald often reminded her daughter , Jenny Blair had never been able really to like her . " I do n't care who her father is , or her mother either , " she decided now , " I know Bena is not all that she ought to be . " They were alone in the big nursery at Curlew , and across the hall , in the best spare bedroom ( which was presided over by two very light-coloured maids in fluted caps and aprons ) , ladies of the romantic age were straightening their trains , settling their lace berthas , and giving a few final touches to light or dark masses of hair worn very high on the head . All the figures reflected inp106the cheval-glasses were queenly and elegant , with proud bosoms , straight fronts , and prominent hips , though the foundations beneath might be , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamma says we must n't go down until she tells us , " Bena whispered , as she peeped through the doors . Then twirling again on her square toes of pink kid , she chanted spitefully , " I know something that you do n't ! " " I do n't care if you do . " Jenny Blair was looking gravely at her face in the mirror and wondering if she would always , even when she grew up , remind herself of Alice in Wonderland ? But Alice was in a book , anyway , so it would have been just as easy to make her with hair that curled naturally . " Bena , " she asked , turning abruptly , " do you know what a wood-nymph is ? Do you s'pose anybody ever really saw one ? " " Of course nobody did . There are n't any such things . " " There are . " " There are n't . You 're saying the word wrong . " " No , I 'm not . I know there 're wood-nymphs because I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't care . There are n't any such things . She was just poking fun . " " It was n't a she . " " Well , he was just poking fun . Men do poke fun , do n't they ? I bet you anything it was that old Aubrey Weare . " " It was n't . " " I bet you it was . I despise him , and so does Aunt Camilla . " Then rising on the tips of her toes , she ex/claimed derisively , " I know something that you do n't ! I know something that you do n't ! " Jenny Blair tossed her plaits . " Well , it 's just about babies , and I do n't care what you know about babies . " " I know where they come from . Bessie Harrison found out when her little brother came . It hurts dreadfully . " " It does n't . " " It does . " " She just made that up . And it does n't matter to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like puppies better . " " You have to if you get married . " " Then I 'll never be married . Some ladies are n't . " " They 're old maids . Nobody wants to be an old maid . " " What are you fussing about , children ? " inquired a voice of faded sprightliness , and Bena 's mother , in blue and lavender gauze , appeared on the threshold . " Mamma , wo n't she have to be an old maid unless she is married ? " Bena asked in the impertinent tone Mrs. Archbald frequently urged her daughter never to imitate . " How silly , Bena . What in the world have you to do with old maids ? " " But she will , Mamma , wo n't she ? " What was it about Mrs. Peyton , Jenny Blair asked herself , gazing at the ashen hair and the long , thin face , with its pale skin the texture of a withered rose , that made her remember a Confederate flag in the rain ? She was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederate flag . No lady could be . Yet Jenny Blair never looked atp108her that she did n't think of a flag going by in the rain to the inspiring music of bands . Was it because she had , as Mrs. Archbald said flatteringly , " such an air " ? In her youth she had been admired less for her features than for her little ways and artless vivacity ; and when her freshness began to fade , her little ways seemed only to multiply and her artless vivacity to increase . Animation , so challenging in youth to the masculine appetite , had degeneratedat middle age into a nervous habit which kept the muscles of her face constantly twitching . " I 've no time to answer foolish questions , Bena . If you are good and quiet , you may tiptoe downstairs to the porch and look in at the dancing . But , remember , you are to come straight upstairs to bed when Mammy sends for you. , , " May we see the ladies fix themselves ? Somebody tore the lace on a train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was Mrs. Birdsong . She slipped as she was coming upstairs . Yes , you may peep in there if you promisenot to touch anything or get in the way . " She floated down the stairs , while the two children , feeling shy and awkward , stole across the hall and into the guest room . " Oh , I 'm so glad there is n't anybody left but Mrs. Birdsong ! " Jenny Blair exclaimed , with a rush of emotion , while she watched Matty , kneeling on the floor , mend a bit of torn lace on the edge of the primrose-colouredtrain . Standing beneath the gilt chandelier , Mrs. Birdsong glanced round with a laugh , " Oh , children , I 'm so happy ! '  |p109Tell  me if I look as happy as any one in the world . " Dumb with worship , the children gazed up at her . Never , oh , never , thought Jenny Blair , trembling with admiration , could there have been , even in fairyland , any one so lovely to look at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist on her forehead and escaped in curls from the soft , loose knot she wore , regardless of changing fashion , on the ivory nape of her neck . The long aquamarine earrings sparkled like a pale reflection of her radiant eyes . From beneath the full bertha of rosepointlace , the high puffed sleeves lent a royal breadth and dignity to her too slender shoulders , and over the starched ruffles that completed every fashionable curve , the primrose-coloured satin rose and fell and flowed and rippled in the shining depths of the cheval-glass . " Do I look happy ? " she repeated . " George says I am at my best to-night . " And her eyes , even more than her words , asked over and over again , " How can I help beinghappy ? How can I help being beautiful ? How can I help being in love with life ? " Yet , while her eyes asked the question , something deeper and darker than her eyes , something fugitive , defiant , and passionately mocking , glimmered in the faint smile on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny Blair checkedherself because she wanted to burst into tears . " When I grow up , I 'm going to wear earrings , " Bena was saying . " Mother had my ears bored when I was a baby , but you do n't have to have holes in your ears any longer . "  |p110Mrs  . Birdsong laughed , while the edge of irony trembled again in her voice . " By that time they may be all the fashion . Thank you , Matty , you mended that very nicely . " Picking up her fan and a bouquet of orchids from the bed , she kissed her hand to the children and passed out into the hall and down the circular staircase to the crowded drawing-rooms , where the chandeliers were wreathed in roses and smilax and white crash was spread over the floors . At the foot of the stairs , Mr. Birdsong had waited , and slipping her hand and the feather fan through his arm , she melted with him into the kaleidoscopicmaze of the waltz . " Mamma says we must n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look in from the porch . The porch is decorated just like the parlours , only there is n't any crash on the floor . " Slipping out through the back door , they ran to one of the long windows on the porch , and looked , beneath swinging Chinese lanterns , into the drawing-rooms . All the dancers had stopped , and stood in rows , watching Mr. and Mrs. Birdsong glide and dip , and glide and dip again to the intoxicating measure of The Blue Danube . Whirling , reversing , gliding , dipping , swinging , flowing , dissolving into the music , they waltzed from the end of the back parlour , past the open doors of the hall , where musicians were hidden in palms , to the front windows , which were festooned in roses and smilax . Clasping Bena 's plump arm , Jenny Blair prayed with passionate intensity , " Oh , God , let my hair grow darker ,  |p111and  make me as beautiful as Mrs. Birdsong . Do n't let me , God , look like poor Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Aunt Etta was sitting against the wall , between Grandfather , who nodded as if he could n't keep his eyes open , and Miss Abby Carter , who pursed her lips into an affected smile , so that she seemed to be saying over and over , " I am having a lovely time , I am having a lovely time . Oh , I must tell everybody what a lovely time I am having . " " I believe I could dance like that if I tried , " Bena said , for that was one of her little ways . " You could n't . Nobody ever waltzed as beautifully as Mrs. Birdsong . Grandfather says so . " " Your grandfather does n't know everything . " This was Bena 's usual retort when she was pushed into a corner . " He knows more than anybody else . He has been to balls with the Prince of Wales and kings and queens . " " That does n't make him know anything . Kings and queens do n't matter any longer . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . But , even if they do , your grandfathercould n't have a party like this . You have n't got a country place and a garden andand both a landau and a victoria and two pair of carriage horses . " Jenny Blair wrinkled her forehead . Had n't she always insisted to her mother that Bena Peyton had no manners ? " Well , I do n't care , " she retorted mysteriously . " We 've got a curiosity , and you have n't . We 've got the funniest bad smell that just comes and goes of itself . "  | " That 's just a smell . Nobody wants a bad smell . " " But it 's a funny smell . It 's a curiosity . " " I do n't care if it is . I do n't want it . And a smell ca n't be a curiosity . You made up that , just as you did wood-nymph . " " Yes , it can . " " No , it ca n't . " Again the music had broken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the white crash . Mrs. Birdsong , with that summer radiance in her face , was standing beside old Colonel Hooper , who had been the best dancer in Queenborough for two generations . Aunt Isabella was walking slowly and haughtily across the floor , followed , Jenny Blair observed , by the pleadingsheep 's eyes of Thomas Lunsford . But Aunt Isabella , with her hand on the arm of a strange young man , took not the faintest notice of Thomas , not even when he strolled casually to her side and asked for a dance . Was it possible that she had got over caring ? Was it possible that Joseph had cured her ? And was n't it strange that the more completely she ignored him , the more actively Thomas pursued ? Well , that was one of the deep mysteriesof conduct . Men always wanted most the thing you least wanted to give them . Oh , if only somebody , no matter how old and ugly , would ask poor Aunt Etta to dance ! Perhaps this one will , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knock-kneed , he seemed to be bearing down , as if driven , in Aunt Etta 's direction . It ca n't be true . Yes , itp113is . He is really seeking her out . To be a man ! Oh , the power , the glory , of being awaited in fear , of being hopefullyawaited , in spite of the most unattractive appearance ! But poor Aunt Etta will dance at last . She will be seen on the floor . She will be saved from the fate of a wallflower , if only by the intervention of Providence and an undesirable partner . Then Jenny Blair 's heart fluttered and sank , like a wounded bird , far below her thin little chest to the place where a flannel band protectedthe depths of her being . For he had not stopped . He had passed Aunt Etta by and was boldly pursuing the prettiest and youngest girl on the floor . He was actuallytaking her from the arms of a blond and adorable youth . It was unfair of God to let Delia Barron have six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Aunt Etta was left sitting , with her sweet expression growing more false every minute , between Grandfather and Miss Abby Carter . Delia Barron was the prettiest girl in the room , after Mrs. Birdsong , who was n't , of course , a girl but a married woman , even though she had never had children , and had never , so Mrs. Archbald had confided to Aunt Etta in Jenny Blair 's hearing , wanted a child . " That , " Mrs. Archbald had added in a lower tone , " is part of the trouble . " What did she mean by trouble ? Jenny Blair asked now , gazing in speechless ecstasy from Aunt Etta to Mrs. Birdsong . How could any one who was all light and bloom and softness have trouble ? Trouble was a drab word . When Jenny Blair shut her eyes and re- peated it slowly , she saw a dull object , shaped like a bundle , which puffed out presently into an old woman , in a gingham apron , knitting a sock . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , imagine Mrs. Birdsong . She could n't even think of her mother , who had had trials , or of Aunt Isabella , who had had blows , or of Aunt Etta , who had had , and indeed was still having , disappointments . A thin veil dropped between her eyes and the dancers . She saw the brilliant colours woven and interwoven into a tremulous pattern , and she thought , " I am so sleepy that I am here and not here . " The bright confusion was flowing within and without , and it was like a stream that reflects but does not hold the images of the sunset . Slippingher hand up her bare arm , she pinched herself sharply . " I must not drop off . I must not shut my eyes . . . . " Hours afterwards , it seemed , a hand touched her shoulder , and there was Matty 's fluted organdie cap bending over her . " I 'd rather put myself to bed , would n't you , Jenny Blair ? " asked Bena , rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " she added . " You slept so long you did n't see Mrs. Birdsong run out of the room while the music was playing . " " Did she run far ? " " There , I told you so . You did sleep a long time . Yes , she dropped her partner 's arm , and ran straight away while everybody was dancing . But Mr. Birdsong went first . He went out with Miss Delia Barron on his arm.  |p115I  saw them go down into the garden . They came out on the porch , and I heard him say , Have you seen the lanternsdown by the lily-pond ? ' " " I do n't care , " Jenny Blair retorted , and she did n't . Even the music and the brilliant colours had ceased to excite her . Her eyelids kept coming down , no matter how hard she tried to keep them up , exactly like the eyes of a wax-doll when the spring that makes them open and shut has been broken . And this broken spring seemed to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't care , " she repeated . " People may run out of dances and go down to lily-ponds as much as they please . I do n't believethey are real . One thing I know , I 've sat up as long as I want to . " In the nursery the night-lamp was burning low under a dark shade , while the strains of a polka floated merrily from downstairs . " Mamma says I must let you sleep on the outside of the bed because you are company , " Bena explained . " Turn round , and I 'll unbutton your dress . Mammy had to go to bed with a headache , and nobody wants Matty about . " Untying the wide blue streamers at her back , Jenny Blair began rolling them smoothly , as her mother had taught her to do . Even if it took a long , long time , every child , when she has n't a nurse , must see that her sash and hair-ribbons are rolled smoothly , unless she is satisfied to appear a frump at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she insisted urgently , while she went overp116the blue streamers , could not make rumpled ribbons look as fresh as they did when they were new . " All the pressingin the world , " she droned sleepily , when a figure darkened the lighted doorway , and Mrs. Birdsong 's voice cried in desperate pain , " Where is Mary Peyton ? Oh , children , can you find Mary Peyton ? " An instant afterwards , she crossed the floor and flung herself down on a couch by the bed , while throbs of anguish shuddered through her in a convulsion . Her hair had slipped from its knot and hung in waving masses on each side of her face , which looked wan and stricken , as if it were the ghost of the happy face Jenny Blair had watched , so short a time before , in the assembling figure of the lancers . Even her primrose-coloured draperies were crushed , and clung about her shape in a desolate pattern of grief . As she lay there , shaken by those long , quivering sobs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she reached up quickly and tore the fragile rose-point bertha away from her bosom . Frightened , yet full of pity and curiosity , the children were shrinking together when the open door shut quickly , and Mrs. Peyton swept in with a dose of medicine in her hand . " Drink this , Eva . It is only ammonia . Nothing in the world has happened , " she continued in a soothing tone . " Your imagination is running away with you . " Turning hastily , she added , " You 'd better undress in my room , children , and be sure to see that the door into the hall is shut tight . " " Oh , I do n't mind the children . " Mrs. Birdsong satp117up and pushed the measuring glass from her lips . " I do n't mind anything . " Sobs shook her afresh , and she flung back the waves of her hair with a passionate gesture . " But I can not bear it . I can never , never , never live through it again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling . No woman does . " Mrs. Peyton 's thin lips wrinkled and tightened , as if they were pulled by a string , and she added in an intense whisper , " You gain nothing in the world by not saving your pride . " " But I saw them , Mary . I saw them with my own eyes " Hush , Eva . It is much wiser to pretend that you did n't . Even if you know , it is safer not to suspect any-thing . " " I 'm flesh and blood . I 've sacrificed everything . " " It 's for your own sake , dear . Do n't think I 'm lacking in sympathy . Here , swallow this down quickly , and let me pin up your hair . Your lovely lace is all torn . " " It makes no difference . Nothing makes any difference . Oh , oh , oh , why did I come ? " " But you looked so happy when you were waltzing together . I never saw you more brilliant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can any one find him ? I must go home . I feel as ifas if " Then I 'll send for him . " Mrs. Peyton glanced round with her anxious look , " Children , do you think you can find Mr. Birdsong ? No , do n't put on your sashes again . Just run downstairs and tell him his wife has been takenp118ill , and must go home . You need n't wait for the Murrays , Eva , " she added , " I 'll send you home in my victoria . Bena , as you go down , tell Johnson to order the vic-toria . " " Oh , I can find Mr. Birdsong , " Bena said proudly . " Jenny Blair was fast asleep , but I saw him go down into the garden . I saw him go down to the lily-pond with Miss Delia Barron . " With a choking cry , Mrs. Birdsong started up from the couch . Then flinging herself down again , she sobbed out hysterically , " Oh , run and find him , Jenny Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill . That I am ill , and must go home . " " Run on , children , " Mrs. Peyton commanded , and while they sped toward the staircase , her voice followed them . " The trouble is , Eva , that you expect too much of life . Every woman must learn that sooner or later " Tingling with excitement and the piquant suspicion that her unbuttoned dress was showing her underbody in the back , Jenny Blair raced ahead of Bena to the staircase , where she saved time by sliding down as much of the banisters as she dared . From below , as she descended bravely but cautiously , she heard music and laughter and the gay popping of corks . " It 's supper-time , " Bena whispered yearningly , as they flitted by , " and they 're all wondering what has become of Mamma . " After making signs to Johnson , the butler , she seized Jenny Blair 's hand and tripped down the porch steps to one of the winding walks that led into the gar/den . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer night was saturated with cool ' sweetness . " It is n't real , " Jenny Blair thought , pausinga moment to drink in the beauty . " It is n't a bit more real than make-believe . " No , it was n't real . It would n't last till to-morrow ; but , oh , it was lovely , it was satisfying , as long as you looked at it . Suddenly she said aloud , " The shadows are alive , and you can hear time moving among them . Bena , if you 'll only stay still , you can hear time stealing by . " But Bena called back spitefully , " No , you ca n't . It 's just the breeze from the river , and our breeze has n't a bad smell . Besides , you did n't make up that about time . I heard Mrs. Birdsong tell you to listen and hear time going by in her garden . " It was true Mrs. Birdsong had told her that . When she stopped and thought about things , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the loveliest fancies into her mind . Because of this , she ought to love her best of allbut she could not . Their secret had woven a magic tie between her and Mr. Birdsong , and this magic tie was stronger than affection , was stronger than gratitude . A thrill was in it , a deep hidden glow , which made everything start out of a drifting haze , just as the trees , and the dark wings of pigeons , and the whitewashed wall , and Penitentiary Bottom started out , alive and quivering , while they sat , hand-in-hand , on the pile of lumber and watched the last flare of the sunset . " They are down there . I see them , " Bena whispered , as she skipped on the grass walk.  |p120Yes  , Jenny Blair could see them now , a dark and a white shape blended together by the swinging light from the Chinese lanterns . When the children flitted nearer , the dark and the white shape appeared to break up and melt apart , as the shadows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze . There was a sigh , a laugh , a gay protest , and a voice asked a trifle sharply , " What are you doing up so late , children ? " That was Mr. Birdsong . Only Mr. Birdsong could speak in an impatient tone with an edge of roughness that was charming . " They sent us to find you , " Jenny Blair answered gravely . " Mrs. Birdsong has had a spell , and she says she must go home . " " A spell ? Eva ? " His tone was all roughened now , the roughness of anxiety , not of annoyance . As he passed under the Chinese lanterns , Jenny Blair saw that his face was flushed and slightly moist , with the puffiness beneath the eyes she had observed regretfully that afternoon in Canal Street . There was the same look of having run too far and too fast , though apparently he had been sitting in one spot , fanned by the river breeze , for nearly an hour . His voice , too , when he spoke again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had worried her in Memoria 's parlour . " Well , run ahead . I 'm coming . I 'm coming as quick as I can . " While he started back to the porch , Delia Barron slipped from the shadows and clung to his side ; but shep121might have been an apparition for all the notice he took of her . Through the illuminated garden , threading his way in and out of the box-maze , he rushed on , without a glance at the loveliness or a thought of the fragrance . Only when they reached the porch and he was about to enter the house , he appeared to remember the girl at hi " side . " Good-night , Delia , " he said , and there was a resentful , almost an angry note , in his voice , " Forgive me for letting you go in alone . " Then following the children up the stairs , he exclaimed in nervous desperation , " Run on , run on , show me where they have taken her ! " When Bena pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the couch on which his wife was lying with her hair still loose on her shoulders and a tragic yet triumphant look in her face . Curious but embarrassed , the children shrank back to the bed , and caught up the half-folded sashes from the coverlet . After all , as they tried to make plain by their behaviour , the nursery belonged to them by rights , and even if they were in the way , they could scarcely be dismissed as intruders . To their astonishment , however , no one , not even Bena 's mother , who let so little escape her , appeared , for the first few minutes at least , to be aware of their presence . ' For Mrs. Peyton was absorbed in ministering to her friend , in supporting her , in smoothing away the tragic yet triumphant expression . " It was a sudden faintness , " she said . " I am always uneasy about her heart when she has these attacks . "  | " A sudden faintness , " Mr. Birdsong repeated , as he swept down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seized his wife in his arms . " Eva , why did n't you tell me ? If I 'd known you were not well , I should never have let you come . " " Will you take me home ? George , I must go home as soon as I can . Mary is sending us in . " " That 's nice of her . Has the carriage come round ? " Mr. Birdsong glanced over his shoulder . " Jenny Blair , will you look out of the window ? " Yes , the victoria was there . Jenny Blair hurried to the window , glanced down on the drive before the door , and came back again . Then , watching the look in Mrs. Birdsong'sface , the child was seized by the feeling of moral nakedness that came to her whenever the veil slipped away from life and even grown-up people stopped pretending . Like a tingling flush , this sensation swept over her , and she knew that she was scorched with shame , not for herself , but for Mrs. Birdsong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her elders begin to crumble on the surface and let glimpses through of feelings that ought never to be exposed , not even in the direst extremity . " If you 'll let me put her to bed . It has all been too much for her , " Mrs. Peyton urged mildly . " Thank you , Cousin Mary , but she 'd better go home . Come , Eva , I 'll take you . " There was something so alive , so helpless , so suffering , in his voice that Jenny Blair trembled with fear lest his wife should resist him . But ,  |p123no  , she did not resist him . She gave herself to his arms as if she were yielding up more than her body . " Yes , take me home , " she said . " Take me home . " That was all , but the words were ringed round with a flame , with the burning sweetness , the pure radiance , which flickered for a heartbeat , and then shone steadily in her eyes , in her smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I carry you ? Are you able to walk ? " How he loved her , Jenny Blair thought , with a twinge of jealousy , though she adored Mrs. Birdsong . " Oh , I 'm able to walk . I 'll be all right again as soon as we are at home . " Rising from the couch , Mrs. Birdsong tucked up her hair in a careless knot , and reached out her arms for the filmy wrap Bena had brought from the guest room . " Is n't my hair a sight ? " she asked almost gaily . " Had n't I better throw a scarf over my head ? " " No , your curls are lovely . " Mrs. Peyton touched the bright head here and there . " Be careful with her , George . She is still feeling faint . " " Oh , I 'll be careful ! " Slipping his arm about his wife , he led her out of the room and down the wide circular staircase . Though she clung to his arm , rhythm flowed again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glance back , her loveliness pierced Jenny Blair 's heart . " Go straight to bed , children , " Mrs. Peyton commanded , " and remember , if any one asks you about Mrs. Birdsong , that she had a sudden faintness and was obliged to leave early . " " A sudden faintness , " the children repeated , while they ran to the window , where , a few minutes afterwards , they were rewarded by the sight of the victoria turning out of the drive , with the moonlight and the deeper yellow of the Chinese lanterns blending over the lustrous folds of primrose-coloured satin . " I do n't believe it was a sudden faintness , " Bena muttered , with one of the darts of wisdom that lent her pert childish features the look of malicious age . " It was , it was , " Jenny Blair returned defiantly . " It was a sudden faintness . Your mother said so . " " She just said that for us . " " No , she did n't . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I ought to know more about it than you do . " That was Bena 's way , no matter where you were or what you were pretending . Slipping out of her clothes and into her nightgown , Jenny Blair rushed back to the window for a last glimpse of the glowing lawn , the pale sky , and the thin mist that fluttered like a dropped scarf over the river . " It was a sudden faintness , " she repeated firmly ; for even at her tender age she had not failed to perceive that you may believe almost anything if you say it over often enough . Then , without cause , without warning , while she stood there in her cambric nightgown , with the river breeze blowing in a sharp spray over her skin , she was visited by one of those swift flashes of ecstasy . Wordless , vast , encompassing , this extraordinary joy broke over her like an invisible shower . Without and within , she felt thep125rain of delight sprinkling her body and soul , trickling over her bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths of her heart . " The world is so lovely , " she cried , dancing round and round on her bare feet . " I 'm alive , alive , alive , and I 'm Jenny Blair Archbald ! "  | " YES , it is true , " said old General Archbald , for he had passed his eighty-third birthday , and had found that phrases , like events , often repeat themselves , " you ca n't mend things by thinking . " Though thought may have created life in the beginning , though the whole visible world may hang suspended in an invisible web of mind , one could not by taking heed mend the smallest break , not the tiniest loosened thread in the pattern . All the thinking in the world , he mused , with a sense of unreality as vague as smoke , could not help Eva Birdsong . For months he had suspected that something was wrong . Not more than ten days ago , he had seen her stop suddenly in the midst of a sentence , while a shiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her lips , and she looked at him with the eyes of a woman in torture . Then she had seemed , by sheer strength of will , to drive the spasm away , to keep the returning pain at a distance . " What is it , Eva ? " he had asked , and she had answered with a laugh of protest , " Oh , nothing . " That was all , " Oh , nothing . " Yet he had not been satisfied ; he had felt uneasy and agitated ; he had known in his heart that something was wrong withp130her . And now he had just heard that they had taken her to the hospital . " They have given her morphine , " Mrs. Archbald was saying , " and George telephoned me that she will be operated on in the morning . If you 'll go up late this afternoon , she thinks she will be able to talk to you . There is something she has on her mind . " Arrested by the pain in his eyes , she added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to you than any one in the world . " With his hands clasped on the ebony crook of his walking-stick , he stood on the front porch and blinked up at his daughter-in-law , while William ( an old dog now , but carrying his years well ) waited for him to go out into the April sunshine in Jefferson Park . " Is there danger ? " he asked , without answering her question . For it was true that Eva was more than a daughter , and nothing is so hard to speak aloud as the truth . " There is , of course , always danger . For a year she has been really ill ; but you know how long it took us to make her submit even to an examination . " " Yes , I know . " The brooding eyes beneath the sardoniceyebrows did not waver . " It does seem exaggerated to carry modesty to the point of endangering one 's life . But with Eva , I think , it was less her own shrinking than the feeling that George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but she told me once he had a horror of what he called maimed women . "  | " Any man worth his salt would think first of her health . " " That is exactly what George said to me an hour ago . But women , especially romantic women like Eva , " she added sagaciously , " make the mistake of measuring a man 's love by his theories . She told me about it the day she was seized with that dreadful pain and I telephoned for Doctor Bridges . " She broke off abruptly , with the feeling probably , the General reminded himself , that she was giving away some solemn league and covenant of woman . If only she would tell him more ! While the thought crossed his mind , he flinched and raised his eyes to the clement sky . If only she would tell him nothing ! After all , there was wisdom in an era that smothered truth in words . For truth , in spite of the stern probings of science , is an ugly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize , " he said , " how little what a man thinks has to do with what he feels . " " Had I ever doubted that , the way George has risen to this crisis would have convinced me . He seems to feel the pain more than Eva does . For three nights he has sat up with her , and he refused to go to bed even after he fell asleep in his chair . The night nurse made him lie down on a couch last night ; but he looks dreadfully haggard this morning , and his nerves are on edge . No man , " she concluded emphatically , " could have shown a greater devotion . " " I can well believe that . "  | " Then why ? Why ? " " Those other things , my dear , have nothing to do with his marriage . " Mrs. Archbald looked puzzled . " But that is just what I mean . There have been so many things in his life that have had nothing to do with his marriage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassing logic of the feminine mind . " Well , George has the kindest heart in the world . But even the kindest heart in the world sometimes fails to get the better of nature . All that side of his life has no more to do with his devotion to Eva than ifthan if it were malaria from the bite of a mosquito . That 's what women , especially women like Eva , are never able to understand . " " No wonder . It seems so illogical . " " Men are n't logical creatures , my dear . Nor , for that matter , is life logical . " Then he asked , " Have you seen Isabella to-day ? " " Yes , she stopped as she was taking little Erminia to the dentist . There 's something wrong with her teeth . It 's such a pity , for she is a beautiful child . " " All three of them are beautiful children . Nature seems to be on the side of Isabella . Well , so am I , if only because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to be rid of a skeleton is to drag it into the light and clothe it in flesh and blood . " Mrs. Archbald looked puzzled . " I do n't understand , Father . "   " I did n't mean you to , my dear , but Isabela would . She is like every other Archbald , only more so , and though she is happily unaware of it , the more so has been her salvation . " Seven years before , three days after the renewal of her engagement to Thomas Lunsford , Isabella had taken the morning train to Washington , and had returned the next afternoon as the wife of Joseph Crocker . " Life is too short , " she had explained , with the clash of coarseness that embarrassed her sister and her sister-in-law , " not to have the right man for your first husband at least . As for what people saywell , if talk could kill , I should have been dead long ago . " Etta had been prostrated ; but Mrs. Archbald had been too busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prejudice . When so few standards remained unimpaired , the distinction between plain people and quiet people was almost obliteratedby the first important step from the Baptist Communionto the Episcopal Church . And everything , of course , was made easier because Joseph had so little religion . . . . " You look tired , Father , " Mrs. Archbald remarked , when she had studied him for a moment . " Had n't you better lie down ? " " No , I like to feel the sun on me , and so does William . We 'll sit in the park awhile and then walk up to the hospital . " " Jenny Blair will go with you . She can wait downstairs while you are in Eva 's room . The child is so distressed . She has always adored Eva . "  | " Every one adores her . " " Well , try not to worry . Something tells me that she will come through . Doctor Bridges feels very hopeful . " " He would naturallybut maimed for life " his voice trembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If only she comes through it well . " Then after a moment 's thought , she added cheerfully , " It is n't as if she were a younger woman and still hoped to have children . She is forty-two , and has been married almost twenty years . One would never suspect that to look at her . " After she finished , he lingered a moment , hoping and fearing that she might , if only by accident , become more explicit . Was she shielding Eva 's modesty from him , an old man , who would have loved her had she been stripped bare not only of modesty but of every cardinal virtue ? Or was such evasion merely an incurable habit of mind ? Would George tell him the truth ? Or was it conceivable that George did not know ? " Will Jenny Blair come in time ? " he asked , pricked by sudden fear . " I should not like to be late . " " Why , you 've at least two hours , Father , and if Jenny Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you myself . " " But I do n't need anybody . I am able to go alone . " No man needed protection less ; but because he had lived a solitary male among women , he could never escape it , and because these women depended upon him , he had remained at their mercy . It was impossible to wound the feelings of women who owed him the bread they ate andp135the roof over their heads , and so long as he did not hurt their feelings , they would be stronger than he was . Always , from his earliest childhood , he mused , with a curious resentment against life , he had been the victim of pity . Of his own pity , not another 's . Of that doubleedgednerve of sympathy , like the aching nerve in a tooth , which throbbed alive at the sight of injustice or cruelty . One woman after another had enslaved his sympathymore than his passion , and never had she seemed to be the woman his passion demanded . Well , it is over , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again this secret hostility swept through his nerves , surprising him by its vehemence . Was it possible that he was beginning to break in mind before the infirmities of the flesh had attacked a single physical organ ? Only yesterday , Bridges had told him that a man of sixty might be proud of his arteries . Only yesterday ! And to-day he was annoyed by this queer tingling in his limbs , by this hollow drumming which advanced along his nerves and then receded into the distance . " Let us sit down a bit , William , " he murmured , walking very erect , with a proper pride in his straight back and thighs and his well-set-up figure for a man of his years . " I suppose this bad news about Eva has disturbed me . I 'd rather lose my right arm than have anything happen to her . " Dropping down on a green bench in the park , beneath a disfigured tulip tree , which was putting out into bud , he tried to imagine her ill , suffering , and waiting calmly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she chose ,  |p136as  always capriciously , her own hour and mood to return to him . Never had he seen her cast aside her armour of gaiety . Never , among all the women he had known , had she asked him for sympathy . Never once had she tried to take care of him . For all her loveliness , she was , he found himself thinking aloud to William , curled up on the grass by the bench , a strong soul in affliction . A strong soul , still undefeated by life , she came to him now . She came to him out of the pale green distance , out of the flying clouds , out of the April bloom of the sky . Even to-day , he mused proudly , there was n't a girl in Queenboroughwho was worthy to step into her shoes . Not one of them . Not Jenny Blair , a vivid little thing , but lacking in queenliness . Resting there , with his tired old hands clasped on the crook of his stick , he told himself that Eva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent vitality , would have put to shame all the professional beauties of Paris or London . Why , he had seen Mrs. Langtry , and had considered her deficient in presence . " Eva would have had all London at her feet , " he meditated , without jealousy , since his devotion , at eightythree , was of the mind alone . Or was this deception ? Did one go down into the grave with the senses still alive in the sterile flesh ? Well , no matter . The thread had snapped , and the question had floated out of his thoughts . Airy and fragile as mist , he watched it blown away into the April world , into that windy vastness which contained the end of all loving and all living.  |p137At  least she had had , he pondered , sitting beside a triangular flower-bed , beneath the pale buds on the tulip tree , what she believed that she wanted . True , her life might have been easier if they had n't been poor . Yet being poor , which kept her from parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also from brooding , from that fatal introspection which is the curse of women and poets . She had not had time to fall out of love . She had not had time to discover that George was unworthy . Or was it conceivable , as Cora suspected , that Eva knew the truth , and was merely preserving appearances ? No , he could not believe this , he mused , poking the end of his stick into a tuft of young dandelions . Yet , while he rejected Cora 's suspicion , he admitted that life would be more agreeable if women could realize that man is not a monogamous animal , and that even a man in love does not necessarily wish to love all the time . Certainly , there would be less unhappiness abroad in the world if good women could either accept or reject the moral nature of man . Over and over , he had seen the faithful lover lose to the rake in an affair of the heart . Over and over , he had seen a miracle of love that failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienceto build on , that even loose-living men are not all of one quality . It was not a simple question of merit . The diversity went deeper , far down through the nature of man into nature itself . George had lived according to life ; his very faults were the too lavish defects of generosity . He was generous with himself always , and with his money whenever he was affluent . Not without a pang , the General remembered that long ago , when he was caught on the verge of financial ruin , George alone among his sympathetic friends had offered him help . The year before George had inherited his father 's modest estate , and he would have sacrificed this fortune to save a friend from disaster . Later on , to be sure , he had speculated unwisely and lost his inheritancebut it was not of this that the General was thinking while he poked at the dandelions . He saw George , with his thick wind-blown hair , his smiling eyes , his look of virile hardness , of inexhaustible energy . Well-favoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or men either for that matter , ever judge by anything else ? But it was more than George 's fine features , ruddy skin , and friendly grey eyes that made one reluctant to blame him . Yes , there was something more , some full-bodied virtue , some compensatinghumanity . " But I am human too , " thought old General Archbald , " and what good has it done me ? " . . As a child , at Stillwater , they had called him a milksop , because he saw visions in the night and wanted to be a poet . The sight of blood sickened him ; yet his grandfatherassured him , with truth , that hunting had given greater pleasure to a greater number of human beings than all the poetry since Homer . Pity , said the men who had none , is a woman 's virtue ; but he had known better than this . A poet 's virtue , it may be . He was not sure.  |p139So  much virtue passed into a poet when he was dead ; when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a library . Little girls , however , were not pitiful . Little girls were as savage as boys , only weaker . They had never failed to torment him . They had laughed when he was made sick ; they had mocked at his visions ; they had stolen his poems and used them for curl-papers . Strange , the images that were dragged up like bits of shell , in a net of the memory ! All his life curl-papers had remained , for him , the untidy symbol of an aversion . No , little girls were not gentle . And even his tenderheartedmother , who nursed her servants in illness , and had never used the word " slave " except in the historical senseeven his mother was incapable of the pity that becomes a torment to the nerves . She accepted meekly , as an act of God 's inscrutable wisdom , all the ancient wrongs and savage punishments of civilization . .. . Again General Archbald sighed and prodded the dandelions . Again the thread snapped and a flock of unrelatedimages darted into his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas ? " his robustgrandfather inquired sternly . " Was he born lack-ing ? " " Not lacking , Father , " his mother protested , " but different . Some very nice people , " she added , with an encouraging glance at her peculiar child , " are born different . He may even turn out to be a poet . " " Do you think , " his father asked in a troubled tone ,  | " that we had better try changing his tutor ? Is it possible that Mr. Davis has infected him with newfangled ideas ? " His mother shook her head in perplexity , for it distressedher that one of her sons should be deficient in manliness . " But the other boys are all manly . Even if Mr. Davis has talked of abolition , after giving us his word that he would treat thethe institution with respect , I have never heard that New Englanders disliked bloodshed . I thought , indeed , it was exactly the opposite . Do n't you remember I opposed your engaging Mr. Davis because I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Perhaps , " she confessed bravely , " he may Inherit his eccentric notions from me . Though I try to be broad-minded , I ca n't help having a sentiment against cock-fights . " " Pooh ! Pooh ! " his grandfather blustered , for he belonged to the Georgian school of a gentleman . " Would you deprive the lower classes of their favourite sport ? As for this young nincompoop , I 'll take him deer-huntingto-morrow . If he is too much of a mollycoddle to kill his buck , we 'll try to scare up a fawn for him . " A famous hunter in his prime , the old gentleman still pursued with hounds any animal that was able to flee . Fortunately , game was plentiful and game laws unknown in the fields and forests of Stillwater . For nothing escapedhis knife or his gun , not the mole in the earth , not the lark in the air . He could no more look at a wild creature without lusting to kill than he could look atp141a pretty girl without lusting to kiss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy the war ; for the killing nerve , as his grandson had once said of him , was the only nerve in his body . Yet he had fallen in love with a woman becauseof her fragile appearance ; and when she had gone into a decline after the birth of her fifth child , and had lost her reason for a number of years , he had remained still devoted to her . Against the advice of his family and his physician , he had refused to send her away , and had kept her , behind barred windows , in the west wing of the house . To be sure , when she died , he had married again within seven months ; but only his first wife , though he had buried two others , had given him children , and through her the strain of melancholy had passed into the Archbald blood . . . . From his father , with filial patience , " For my part , I try not to kill a doe or a fawn . " " Fiddlesticks , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord provide negroes for our servants and animals for our sport ? Have n't you been told this from the pulpit ? I hope , sir , I sha n't live to see the day when every sort of sport is no longer welcome at Stillwater . " Even the field hands in the quarters , General Archbald remembered , had their " coon or possum dawgs , " and went rabbit chasing on holidays when there were no cock-fights . High or low , good or bad , manners at Stillwater were a perpetual celebration of being alive . No other way of living had ever seemed to him so deeply rooted in the spirit of place , in an established feeling for life . Not forp142happiness alone , not for life at its best only , but for the whole fresh or salty range of experience . There was , too , a quality , apart from physical zest , that he had found nowhere else in the world , a mellow flavour he had never forgotten . Naturally , as a child , he did not hunt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a brilliant November morning , he watched a buck at bay pulled down by the hounds in a rocky stream . He could not remember how it had happened . By accident , probably , when he was out with his tutor . At first , watching the death , he had felt nothing , Then , in a spasm , the retch of physical nausea . For the eyes of the hunted had looked into his at the end ; and that look was to return to him again and again , as a childish fear of the dark returns to the grown man when his nerves are unstrung . In how many faces of men , women , children , and animals , all over the world , had he seen that look of the hunted reflected ? A look of bewilderment , of doubt , of agony , of wondering despair ; but most of all a look that is seeking some God who might , but does not , show mercy . All over the world ! North , South , East , West . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and a savage joy inflaming his face , his grandfather strode over to smear stains on a milksop . " If you do n't like the taste of blood better than milk , you 'll have to be blooded . Hold still , sir , I say , and be blooded . " Then , as the blood touched him , the boy retched with sickness , and vomited over the anointinghand and the outstretched arm . " Damn you , sir ! "  |p143the  old gentleman bellowed , while he wiped away the mess with his silk handkerchief . " Go back to the nursery where you belong ! " Still retching , furious and humiliated because he had been born a milksop , the boy rode home with his tutor . " I do n't love people ! " he sobbed passionately . " I do n't love people ! " Was it fair to blame him because he had been born different ? Was anybody to blame for the way God had let him be born ? How close that day seemed to him now , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , the clearer it appeared in his vision . Things near at hand he could barely remember . Even yesterday was smothered in fog . But when he looked far back in the past , at the end of seventy years or more , the fog lifted , and persons and objects started out in the sunken glow on the horizon . Instead of diminishing with time , events in the deep past grew larger , and the faces of persons long dead became more vivid and lifelike than life itself . " It is old age , " he thought wearily . " It is a sign of old age to lack proper control . " Or was the cause deeper still ? he mused , while the shadow of a bird flitted over the grass and was gone . Was this second self of his mind , as variable as wind , as nebulous as mist , merely the forgotten consciousness of the poet who might have been ? Sitting here in the spring sunshine , was he living again , was he thinking again , with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , he realized , were the words of that second self , of the self he had always been in dreams and never beenp144in reality . Again the bird flitted by . He did not know . He could not tell . No matter how hard he tried , it was impossible to keep his thoughts from rambling back into the past . It was impossible to trace a connection between the past and present . Was he growing , in his old age , like poor Rodney , who had surrendered to shadows ? Better let the past disappear , and hold firmly to the bare structureof living . For an instant his look wandered from the trees in the park to the few carriages and many motor cars in Washington Street . Yes , the world was changing rapidly , and he wondered what was waiting ahead . He could remember when Queenborough had the charm of a village ; but now , wherever he looked , he found ugliness . Beauty , like every other variation from type , was treated more or less as a pathological symptom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did ugliness conform , he pondered fancifully , to some automatic a stheticspring in the dynamo ? But even if the scientific method destroyed beauty , there would be no more great wars , only little wars that no one remembered , said John Welch . What , indeed , would be left to fight about when people thought alike everywhere , and exact knowledge had spread in a vast cemetery for ideals all over the world ? So John Welch , being very advanced in opinion , would argue for hours ; but when argument was ended , old General Archbald could not see that human nature was different from what it had been in his youth . To be sure ,  |p145idealism  , like patriotism , appeared to diminish with every material peace between conflicts ; but he was near enough to the Spanish War , and indeed to the Civil War , to realize that the last battle has never been fought and the last empty word has never been spoken . Not that it mattered . All he knew now was that he was too old to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about cruelty , which he had seen all over the world , in every system invented by man ; which he had seen in a velvet mask , in rags , and naked except for its own skin . Yes , he was too old to suffer over the evils that could not be cured . Only , whenever he listened to John Welch assailing the present order , he was reminded of his own revolt against slavery in the eighteen fifties . The reformers of that age had believedthat all the world needed was to have negro slavery abolished . Yet negro slavery was gone , and where it had been , John said , another system had ushered in the old evils with a clean , or at least a freshly wiped face . What the world needed now , cried the modern reformers , like John Welch , was the new realism of science . For one confirmed habit had not changed with the ages . Mankind was still calling human nature a system and trying vainly to put something else in its place . But a world made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stark and colourless spectacle to old David Archbald . A thin-lipped world of facts without faith , of bones without flesh . Better the red waistcoats and the soulful vapouring of early Romanticism . Better even the excessivesensibility of mid-Victorian aesthetics . Since he be- longed to the past , if he belonged anywhere , his mental processes , it seemed , were obliged to be disorderly . When he said , " I am more than myself , " when he said , " Life is more than living , " when he blundered about " the nature of reality , " he was still , or so John Welch declared , harpingon a discredited idealism . " Transcendental ! " John would snap when he meant " Nonsense ! " Glancing from the street to the sky , while the thread broke again , General Archbald reflected that it was easy to be an idealist in this pleasant spring of the year 1914 , and to look with hope , if not with confidence , to the future . It was true that the familiar signs of uneasiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in China and Mexico , where one naturally expected trouble to be , but among a part at least of the population of Europe . Power everywhere was growing more arrogant , and unrest more unrestful . Socialism was springing up and taking root in soil that appeared sterile . In Great Britain , Ulster and the suffragettes were disturbinga peace that turned in its broken sleep and dreamed of civil war . Nearer home , pirates had deserted the seas and embarked afresh as captains of industry . But in the realm of ideas , where hope reigned , the prospect was brighter . There the crust of civilization , so thin and brittle over the world outside , was beginning to thicken . Religion and science , those hoary antagonists , were reconciled and clasped in a fraternal embrace . Together , in spite of nationalism , in spite even of nature , they would build , or invent , the New Jerusalem for man/kind . In that favoured province , smooth , smiling , welltravelled , there would be neither sin nor disease , and without wars all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the old sunning themselves on green benches , would be allowed to ramble in mind . Well , perhaps . . . . No harm could come , he supposed , of a sanguine outlook . Onlyonly , did not that outlook approach a little too close to a formula ? Were material ends all the world needed to build on ? Was passion , even in the old , a simple problem of lowering your blood pressure and abandoning salt ? Could a man discard his thinking self as lightly as he discarded the doctrine of an ultimate truth ? When John said , " A green bench is only a green bench , " was he wiser than old David Archbald , who replied , " A green bench is not the green bench I touch " ? True , men no longer wrangled in public halls over the nature of reality . But he could not see that exact knowledge and precision of language had improved the quality of mankind . Well , the wonder in every age , he supposed , was not that most men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only a few in every age , and these few were the clowns in the parade . . . . Suddenly , while he meditated , it seemed to him that the shape of the external world , this world of brick and asphalt , of men and women and machines moving , broke apart and dissolved from blown dust into thought . Until this moment he had remembered with the skin of his mind , not with the arteries ; but now , when the concrete world disappeared , he plunged downward through a dim vista of time , where scattered scenes from the past flickeredand died and flickered again . At eighty-three , the past was always like this . Never the whole of it . Fragments , and then more fragments . No single part , not even an episode , complete as it had happened . In each hour , when he had lived it , life had seemed important to him ; but now he saw that it was composed of things that were all little things in themselves , of mere fractions of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the moment in which they had quivered and vanished . How could any one , he asked , resting there alone at the end , find a meaning , a pattern ? Yet , though his mind rambled now , he had walked in beaten tracks in his maturity . His soul , it is true , had been a rebel ; but he had given lip-homage , like other men all over the world , to creeds that were husks . Like other men all over the world , he had sacrificed to gods as fragile as the bloom of light on the tulip tree . And what was time itself but the bloom , the sheath enfolding experience ? Within time , and within time alone , there was life the gleam , the quiver , the heart-beat , the immeasurablejoy and anguish of being . . . . The trail plunged straight and deep into the Novemberforest . There was the tang of woodsmoke far off in a clearing . Frost was spun over the ground . The trees were brilliant with the yellow of hickory , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why was he here ? How had he come ? Was he awakep149or asleep ? Ah , he knew the place now . A forest trail at Stillwater . But they had left Stillwater fifty years ago . Well , no matter . No matter that he was a boy and an old man together , or that the boy wanted to be a poet . It was all the same life . A solitary fragment , but the same fragment of time . Time was stranger than memory . Stranger than his roaming again through this old forest , with his snack and a thin volume of Byron tucked away in his pocket . Here was the place he had stopped to eat his snack , while his pointer puppies , Pat and Tom , started game in the underbrush . Then , as he stood with his head up and his eyes on the westering sun through the trees , he knew that he was watched . He knew that there were eyes somewhere among the leaves , and that these eyes , the eyes of the hunted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the dying buck , but now it was everywhere . In the trees , in the sky , in the leaf-strewn pool , in the underbrush , in the very rocks by the trail . All these things reflectedand magnified to his quivering nerves the look of the hunted . Because of the fear in his nerves , he cried out , expecting no answer . But before his call ended , there was a stir in the woods ; the leaves scattered ; and through the thick branches , he met the eyes of a runawayslave . Ragged , starved , shuddering , a slave crouched on the forest mould , and stared at the bread and meat in the boy 's hand . When the food was given to him , he gulped it down and sat watching . Haggard with terror and pain , a dirty rag wrapping his swollen jaw ,  | his clothes as tattered as the shirt of a scarecrow , he had been driven by hunger and cold up from the swamps . His breath came with a wheezing sound , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( A sour smell and a filthy rag after nearly seventy years ! ) For weeksfor months , even , he may have lain hidden ; but the deep swamps were far away , and he was the first fugitive slave to come within the boundaries of Stillwater . Beyond speech , beyond prayer , nothing remained in his eyes but bewilderment . " Nobody will hurt you , " the boy said , emptying his pockets of the cornbread he had brought for the puppies . " Nobody will hurt you , " he repeated , as if the creature were deaf or inarticulate . While he gave the promise , a wave of courage , of daring , of high adventure , rushed over him . For the second time in his young life he was defying the established order , he was in conflict with the moral notions of men . Is it true , he asked himself now , that man 's pity and man 's morality are for ever in conflict ? Is it true that pity is by nature an outlaw ? Well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not for an instant . Again that day he had returned to the hidden place in the forest . He had brought clothes taken from the old garments in his father 's and his grandfather 's closets , food that he had found put away in the pantry , and a little wine that had been left over in the glasses at lunch . From his own bed he had stolen a blanket , and from his grandfather 's " body servant " he had borrowed , as if in jest , the " ticket " that permitted Abram Jonas to visitp151his wife in another county . " When it is over , they will have to know , " the boy thought , as he trudged back into the forest with the help he had come to fetch . " When it is over . " And then what had happened ? His memory faded , died down to ashes , and shot up more brightly . Two mornings later , he had set out in an old buggy , with a decently clothed servant on the seat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had put a knapsack of food and the money he was saving to buy a colt into the hands of the runaway . " Your name is Abram Jonas . This is a paper that says so . You belong to Gideon Archbald , and you are going to visit your wife in Spottsylvania . Do you remember that ? What is your name ? Say it once more . " " Abram Jonas , marster . " " You 'd better repeat it as you go along . I am Abram Jonas . Here is the paper that says so . " " I'se Abram Jonas , marster . Dis heah is de paper . " The fugitive looked up at him , first with the fear of the hunted , then with a dawning intelligence . " Thanky , marster , " and turning , he had limped away from the turnpike into a forest trail . What had become of him ? Had he escaped ? Was he caught ? Did he drop down like an animal and die of the shuddering misery of life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But no word had come . Only silence . Only silence , and the feeling that he had taken his stand against the forces men about him called civilization . He had defied not only the moral notions of his age and his place , but the law and the Constitution and the highest court in the land . The truth came out at last when the real Abram Jonas asked for the return of his " ticket " ; and , as a measure of discipline , David 's father sent his youngest son abroad to be educated . He was sixteen then ; and years afterwards , when he left Oxford , he had lived in Paris and London . Ironically , he had begun to think of himself as a stranger in his world and his age . Yet when the war came , he was drawn back to his own . He was drawn back to fight for old loyalties . After the war he had endured poverty and self-denial and , worst of all , darned clothes for a number of years . Then , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erminia and proposed to her the next morning . Well , the past was woven of contradictions . For eighty-three years he had lived two lives , and between these two different lives , which corresponded only in time , he could trace no connection . What he had wanted , he had never had ; what he had wished to do , he had never done . . . . A fog clouded his mind , and he heard a voice like his own remark testily , " Rambling is a sign of age , but I ca n't keep hold of the present . " He could n't keep hold of yesterday , of last month , of last year , of the faces he knew best , of the features even of his wife , which had grown vague since her death . Now , at the end , all faces of women , even the faces of women he had slept with , looked alike to him . All faces of women , except , perhaps he was n't surethe face of Eva Birdsong . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while this suppressedp153irritation clotted his thoughts . " I 'm too old to remember that anything , especially any woman , made . a difference in life . " Then , softly , while he was thinking this , the fog in his mind dispersed , and the crowd of women 's faces melted to air , and reassembled in a solitary face he had not forgotten . Fifty yearsnearer sixty years nowsince he had lost her . What was the use , he pondered resentfully , in dragging back that old memory , that old passion ? Why could n't the dead stay dead when one had put them away ? Half a century of dust ! Yet she came to him , unspoiled by time , out of the drifting haze of the present . Was it because he had loved her alone ? Or did she shine there , lost , solitary , unforgotten , merely because she was farther away than the others ? Not that it mattered . The cause was unimportant beside the vast significance of that remembrance . But why , after all , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with her that April in England , he could not point to a single perfection and say , " I love her because she is beautiful , or brilliant , or gifted . " There was nothing unusual about her , his friends had remarked wonderingly . Dozens of women he knew in London were handsomer , or wittier , or more conspicuouslygood . Small , shy , pale , she was utterly lacking in the presence so much admired by English society in the eighteen fifties . When he first met her , she was married to the wrong man , and was the mother of two delicate children . Hadp154he fallen in love with a veiled emptiness , a shadow withoutsubstance ? Yet her blue eyes , as soft as hyacinths , had promised joy that was infinite . Or had he loved her because he had seen in her face the old fear and bewildermentof the hunted ? Had her memory endured because it was rooted not in desire but in pity ? Happier loves , lighter women , he had forgotten . No matter what people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to bed with a woman to fix her face in one 's mind . For this woman alone he had loved and lost without wholly possessing . Yet she was there when he turned back , clear , soft , vivid , with some secret in her look that thrilled , beckoned , and for ever eluded him . Her eyes were still eloquent with light ; the promised joy was still infinite ; the merest glimmer of a smile had outlasted the monumentsof experience . Yet like everything else in his life , important or unimportant , his passion seemed , when it occurred , to come at the wrong moment . He had intended to leave London ; his ticket to Paris was in his pocket ; his bags were packed . Then a tooth had begun to achea tooth he had lost only last yearand he had decided to stay over a day or two and consult an English dentist who had once treated him for an abscess . Not an act of God , he told himself ( unless a twinge of pain were an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destiny . Had the pain come a day later , just one sunrise and one sunset afterwards , he might have escaped . But falling as it did inp155that infinitesimal pin point of time , his fate had been imprisoned in a single luminous drop of experience . Looking back , he had often wondered why there had been no suspicion of danger , no visible or invisible warningthat he was approaching the crossroads . Even the voice of his old friend was not ruffled when she met him on his way to the dentist and asked him to dinner . Some one had dropped out at the last moment . Tony Bracken ( he had not forgotten that it was Tony Bracken ) had been summoned to the deathbed of his great-uncle , and since Tony was the heir , he was obliged , naturally , to go when he was summoned . So , in spite of an occasional twinge , young David had braced himself with whiskey , applied laudanum to his tooth , and set out on an adventurebeside which all the other occasions of his life were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if she had not stood alone in that particular spot , between a lamp and a window , he might never have noticed her . " I wonder who she is , " he thought , observing her loneliness ; and then , as she raised her lowered lashes and he met her gaze , " She looks frightened . " Was he called or driven when he went straight to her through the crowded room ? Was it pity or the compulsion of sex that awakened while he watched her hesitate , bite her lip with a nervous tremor , and try in vain to think of something to say ? " What can have frightened her ? " he thought , as his hand closed over hers . Her eyes held him , and he asked , " Are you alone ? " She shook her head . " No , my husband is with me . " Her hus- band ! Well , most women had husbands , especially most women one met at dinner in London . It was too late after that first look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think even of children . In the end her marriage had won , as dead sounds inevitably win over living voices ; but while he stood there and looked into her upturned face , that sulky , well-set-up sportsman and his two vague childrenhad no part in the moment . Nothing mattered to him but the swift , tumultuous , utterly blissful sense of recognition of now , here , this is my hour . Not the indefiniteperhaps , to-morrow , some day in the future . The world , so colourless an instant before , had become alive to the touch . People and objects , sights , sounds , scents even , were vibrating with light . And now , after sixty years , he could see that moment as clearly and coldly as if it were embedded in crystal . What is memory , a voice asked on the surface of thought , that it should outlast emotion ? For he remembered , but he could feel nothing . Nothing of the old rapture , the wildness , the illusion of love 's immortality . He still mused with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose death had brought him release ; but the burning ecstasy of desire had left only emptiness . Only emptiness , and the gradual chill of decay . Why had it happened ? What was the meaning of it all ? he demanded , caught within the twisting vision of age . Why had passion strong enough to ruin his life for/saken him while he lived ? Why had it left only two diminished shapes , performing conventional gestures in a medium that was not timethat was not eternity ? Did they still exist , those diminished shapes , in a timeless reality ? Were they blown off from time into some transparentsubstance superior to duration ? Did he survive there and here also ? Which was the real David Archbald , the lover in memory , or the old man warming his inelastic arteries in the April sunshine ? Or were they both merely spirals of cosmic dust , used and discarded in some experimental design ? . . . For an hour , a single hour , of her love he would have given his life when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the universe . Yet if she returned to him now , he knew that it would mean only an effortonly the embarrassment that comes to persons who have loved and separated when they were young , and then meet again , unexpectedly , after they have grown old apart . Strangely enough , if any woman were to return from the dead , he preferred that she should be Erminia . Were the dead like that to the old ? Were the intenser desires obliterated by the duller sensations ? Joy , longing , disappointment , personalities that impinged upon one another , and then , separating , left only a faint outline of dust . Life was not worth the trouble , he thought . Life was not worth the pang of being , if only that faint outlineremained . For the passion of his youth had ended as swiftly as it had begun , and at first he had not even suspected that the vehement craving was love . Helpless ,  | bewildered , he had struggled blindly in the grasp of a power he could not resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her presence brought the world into beauty , that his whole being was a palpitating ache for her when she was absent . Inarticulate , passive , without the compelling ardour of sex , she had exercised that ruthlesstyranny over desire . Or was it true , as he had sometimesimagined , that he himself was a rare , or perhaps a solitary , variation from sex ? Were his deeper instincts awakened only by pity ? As the generations went on , would there be others and still others of his breed born into an aging world ? Was he more civilized than the average race of males , or simply more white-livered , as his virile grandfather believed ? Well , he was too old , he repeated stubbornly , and life was too long over , to bother about what could n't be helped . All he asked now was to sit in the April sunshine and wait for death with William beside him . But was it really long over ? What if it were true that some fragment of his lost ecstasy still survived there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time ? What if it were true that such bliss , such agony , such unavailing passion , could never end ? All that spring and a part of the summer they had met secretly and joyously ; and their secret joy had overflowed into the visible world . The landscape in which they moved borrowed the intense , quivering brightness of a place seen beneath the first or the last sunbeams . Spring was as fair as it looks to a man about to be hanged . Never again were thep159fields so starry with flowers , the green so luminous on the trees , the blue of the April sky so unearthly . Years afterwards ( sometimes as a young man in a strange bed , or again in the long fidelity to a wife he had never desired ) a flitting dream of that English spring would flood his heart with an extraordinary delight . For a moment , no longer , since he invariably awoke while the joy flickered and died . Always , except in dreams , the past had escaped him . The anguish alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh to his bones or the nerves to his brain . And even in sleep , his bliss , when it returned , was only the tremor of light before a dawn that never approached . Would it have been different if she had lived ? For she had not lived , and he could never know what his life might have been without that ugly twist in the centre . They had planned to go away together , he devoured by love and longing , she fearful , passive , yielding mutely to that implacable power . In July , they would go to Venice and begin life over in Italy . The tickets were bought ; her few boxes were at the station ; the compartment was reserved ; and then the merest accident had detained them . In the middle of that last night , while she was destroyingher letters , one of the children had awakened with a sore throat . The nurse had come for her ; she had sat till dawn beside the crib in the nursery ; and when morning came she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of life , of the unknown , had triumphed over them both.  |p160For  an eternity , it seemed to him , he walked the station platform . The guard shut the doors fast ; the train drew out slowly . Still he watched with an intolerableache of desolation while the engine was sliding over the straight track to the gradual curve in the distance . Then , turning away , he wandered , distraught with misery , out into the street . Why ? why ? why ? he demanded of a heaven that seemed as unstable as water . Overhead , low , flying clouds scudded like foam driven by wind . In the country , he walked for hours through rain vague as suspense , soft , fine , slow as mist falling . Afterwards , she wrote that the struggle was over ; she could not give up her childrenand in the early autumn he heard from a stranger that she had drowned herself in a lake . Lost , vanished , destroyed by the fear for which he had loved her in the beginning ! When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , to the secret places where they had met and loved in the spring . In his memory , these places shone out suddenly , one after another , as scattered lights come out in a landscape at dusk . The woods , the fields , the stream where cowslips bloomed , the grey bench with its blurred marking , the flowers , the bright grass . Now it was spring , but in this flickering scene , he walked there in autumn . Everything returned to him ; the falling leaves , the trail of autumn scents in the air , everything but the vital warmth in his agony . Yet he knew , while this light flashed out and moved on again , through the encompassing darkness , that the form , if not the essence ,  |p161of  his passion had lain hidden somewhere beneath the surface of life . In his anguish , he had flung himself beyond time , beyondspace , beyond the boundaries of ultimate pain . A panic stillness was in the air ; the whole external world , the blue sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the grass sprinkled with bloom , all this was as hollow as a bubble blown from a pipe . Nothing remained alive , nothing but his despair in a universe that was dead to the touch . Again and again , he had cried her name in this panic stillness . He had cried her name ; but she was gone ; she could never return . Not though he waited for ever in the place she had left , could she return to him . In the end , she had escaped the terror of life . She had escaped his love and his pity . She had escaped into hollowness . But while the light shone in that vacant place , every twig on the trees , every blade of grass stood out illuminated . Then this also had passed . Anguish , he discovered , was scarcely less brief than joy . The light went out and moved on again . Days , weeks , months , years passed , and a thick deposit of time hardened into a crust of despair over his wound . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in forming the thought had already begun to forget and to recover . Yet , though he enjoyed life again , he never lost entirely the feeling that he was crippled in spirit , that there was a twisted root , an ugly scar , at the source of his being . The poet had died in him , and with the poet had died the old living torment of pity . When hep162sailed home to fight with his people , he found that the hunted buck , the driven slave , the killing of men in battle , left him more annoyed than distressed . Nothing , not even death , not even dying , seemed important ; yet it was amazing to discover how much pleasure could come after one had ceased to expect happiness . Little things began to matter supremely . A smile , a kiss , a drink , a chance encounterin love or war . Appetite , he told himself , with gay cynicism , had taken the place of desire ; and it was well that it should be so . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one were careful not to probe deeply , not to touch life on the nerve . If only one were careful , too , not to shatter the hardened crust of despair . Even so , there were moments , there were hours when he was visited by the old sensation of something missing , as if he were part of a circle that was bent and distorted , end broken in pieces . Life , as well as himself , seemed to be crippled , to have lost irrevocably a part of the whole . Still , in the solitude of the night , he would awake from his dream of a bliss that hovered near but never approached , and think , with a start of surprise , " If I awoke and found her beside me , would all the broken pieces come together again ? Should I find that life was simple and right and natural and whole once more ? " Then the dream , the surprise , the pang of expectancy , would fade and mingle and dissolve into emptiness . Like a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would distract his mind with those blessed little things of life that bear thinking about . Well , he was used to it now ,  |p163he  would repeat again and again ; he was used to the ache , the blankness , even to the stab of delight which pierced him in sleep . He had accepted the sense of somethingmissing as a man accepts bodily disfigurement . After the first years of his loss , he was prepared , he felt , for all the malicious pranks grief can play on the memory . He was prepared even for those mocking resemblancesthat beckoned him in the street , for those arrowy glimpses of her in the faces of strange women , for that sudden wonder , poignant as a flame , " What if the past were a delusion ! What if she were within reach of my arms ! " No , it had been many years , thirty , almost forty years , since life had so mocked him . He had fought through the war . Strange , how insignificant , how futile , any war appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he took an active part in one , understand the fascination war exercised over the human mind . Then , when it was over , he had let life have its way with him . Though the poet in him was lost , he became in later years a prosperous attorney , and a member in good standing , so long as one did not inquire too closely , of the Episcopal Church . . . Sitting there in the pale sunshine , so carefully brushed and dressed by his man Robert , he told himself that , in spite of the ugly twist in the centre , he had had a fair life . Nothing that he wanted , but everything that was good for him . Few men at eighty-three were able to look back upon so firm and rich a past , upon so smooth and variegated a surface . A surface ! Yes , that , he realized now , was the Haw in the structure . Except for that one defeated passion in his youth , he had lived entirely upon the shifting surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful lawyer , a faithful husband , an indulgent father ; he had been , indeed , everything but himself . Always he had fallen into the right pattern ; but the centre of the pattern was missing . Once again , the old heartbreaking question returned . Why and what is human personality ? An immortal essence ? A light that is never blown out ? Or a breath , a murmur , the rhythm of molecular changes , scarcely more than the roving whisper of wind in the tree-tops ? A multitude of women people the earth : fair women , dark women ; tall women , short women ; kind women , cruel women ; warm women , cold women ; tender women , sullen womena multitude of women , and only one among them all had been able to appease the deep unrest in his nature . Only one unit of being , one cluster of living cells , one vital ray from the sun 's warmth , only one ripple in the endless cycle of time or eternity , could restore the splintered roots of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilment , completeness , perfection . A single personality out of the immense profusion , the infinite numbers ! A reality that eluded analysis ! And yet he had been happy as men use the word happiness . Rarely , since his youth , had he remembered that something was missing , that he had lost irrevocably a part from the whole ,  |p165lost  that sense of fulfilment not only in himself but in what men call Divine goodness . Irrevocablybut suppose , after all , the loss were not irrevocable ! Suddenly , without warning , a wave of joy rose from the unconscious depths . Suppose that somewhere beyond , in some central radiance of being , he should find again that ecstasy he had lost without ever possessing . For one heart-beat , while the wave broke and the dazzling spray flooded his thoughts , he told himself that he was immortal , that here on this green bench in the sun , he had found the confirmation of love , faith , truth , right , Divine goodness . Then , as swiftly as it had broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the surprise , the startled wonder , faded into the apathetic weariness of the end . He was only an old man warming his withered flesh in the April sunshine . " My life is nearly over , " he thought , " but who knows what life is in the end ? " A cloud passed overhead ; the changeable blue of the sky darkened and paled ; a sudden wind rocked the buds on the tulip tree ; and in the street , where life hurried by , a pillar of dust wavered into the air , held together an instant , and then sank down and whirled in broken eddies over the pavement.  |p169JENNY  BLAIR was coming to him through sunlight netted with shadows . With an effort , General Archbald detached himself from the past , from the twisted fibres of buried hopes and fears and disappointments . For an instant , as he reached the surface of living , it seemed to him that he was suffocated by the thicker air of the actuality . Then , collecting his thoughts , he rose unsteadily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wandering mind , " he said aloud to William , who rose also and stood at attention . " The important thing is to hold the thread , to keep the connection . " After that dim vista , the light of the present dazzled his eyes , and he blinked as he watched his granddaughtercome to him along the gravelled walk between plots of grass sprinkled with buttercups . He saw her first as a small bright shape in living blue . Then , while she came nearer , he asked himself where was the fascination of youth , and why age had surrenderedso completely to its arrogant power . Jenny Blair was lovely , as most budding things are lovely to old eyes ; but she would never have been called a beauty , he told himself , by King Edward VII . Nor , indeed , by Princep170Albert , who also admired queenliness . She lacked height ; she lacked repose ; she was entirely wanting in presence . Yet she walked well ( happily the sheath skirt , so crampingto Isabella 's voluptuous style , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in her way , fresh , sparkling , dewy with innocence . Women were wearing wide collars of white lawn , and her small ivory throat arched delicately from the sheer fabric . There was a wreath of cornflowers on her hat , and under the dipping brim of black straw her hair shone with the pale lustre of honey . A shallow face , vague and heart-shaped in contour , but with flashes of pure loveliness . Beneath the golden curve of her eyebrows , her yellow-hazel eyes , set wide apart , held the startled and expectant gaze of a child . More than any trait in her character or disposition , he recognized this look , curious , watchful , amazed , as an inheritancefrom his own youth . Nothing else in her features or expression belonged to his past . Even her colouring , with its honey-softness and transparent rose , had come from her mother 's family ( all the Wellfleets except Cora had that pale golden hair ) , and bore no kinship to the rich dusk of the Archbalds . But this startled wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying , " Let me out ! Let me out ! " never failed to appeal to his tenderness . That captive impulse , he assuredhimself , was not inherited from her mother . " Have you waited long , Grandfather ? I am so sorry . " Through the web of sun and shadow , she flitted in her long blue dress over the tender grass in the park . Herp171face was flushed with the bloom of spring ; her eyes were shining with sunlight ; her moist red lips , which had a sullen droop when she frowned , were parted in a smile of contrition . He drew out his watch . " No , it is early yet . You came just at the right moment . I must have been dozing . " Looking down on her , he felt suddenly bowed , he felt flattened out beneath the pressure of age . Before she came he had been tranquil , detached , confirmed in disappointment ; but now he was aware , with an aching regret , of his withered flesh , of his brittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin and bluish hollows under his eyes , of the furrows between his jutting eyebrows , and the congested veins in his nose . " I am too old , " he thought , " but an hour ago , on that green bench , I was young . I was beyond time , and I was young . Is this impression more real than that one ? Is the fact more livingthan the idea ? " Then holding tight to his stout ebony walking-stick , he threw up his head with the bridlingmovement of an old race horse . The chief thing was to govern one 's faculties , to keep control of one 's thoughts . At eighty-three , it did no good to have a buried poet pop up from the depths and caper gallantly on the frozen surface of pretense . After all , nothing mattered very much , not even the rambling mind of the old . In another decade he would know more , or perhaps less , of the nature of reality . " Had n't you better take my arm , Grandfather ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm still able to walk alone . " " Of course you are . But the pavement is so rough . Anybody may stumble on this pavement , " Jenny Blair added in the tactful tone of her mother . " Well , it 's true my legs are n't what they used to be . If you could give me a new pair of legs , I 'd be as sound as I ever was . " Yes , she was a dear little thing . Even her wildness , which he deplored , was the natural craving of youth for delight . In a few years she would probably fold her wings and settle down as her mother had done before her . Next winter , when she was eighteen , she would be presented to established society in Queenborough ; and Mrs. Archbald had already decided that , after a receptionin the afternoon to mature ladies of consequence , a fancy ball , which provided unlimited opportunities for dressing up , would be more amusing than the conventionalcoming-out party . But , with that ancient perversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jenny Blair rejected both Queenborough society and the fancy ball . Instead of conforming to habit , she declared vaguely but passionately that she wished to go away to New York , , or even to Paris , and be something different . A great many girls , she insisted , were being something different even in Queenborough , and she had determined to share in their efforts . She was not quite sure what she wished to be ; but she was inclined to think that she might be/come an actress . Bena Peyton , who was trying to write for magazines , would go with her , and they could perfectlywell take a little apartment and live comfortably , with one coloured maid , on the money their mothers saved from presentations to Queenborough society . Naturally , Mrs. Archbald , who had hoped for a second blooming from her daughter 's formal introduction to parents and aunts and cousins of boys and girls she had played with all her life , was annoyed and displeased ; but her father-in-law showed an astonishing sympathy with the revolt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society ; but he had been always , he was fond of saying , " a believer in not doing the things one did not wish to do . " Walking now by Jenny Blair 's side , he remembered the time when he , too , had longed to go away and be different . But much experience , and especially long waiting , had taught him that there is no place in the world where one can be different from one 's self . Places , like persons , he observed to William , who had paused to examine the smells about the roots of a tree , vary chiefly in the matter of climate . Warm or cool , an altitude or a plain ; but no spot on earth contains the natural resources of happiness . Take Washington Street , for example . In Washington Street , where elegance had once flourished and fallen , only the disfigured elms still struggled to preserve the delusion of grandeur . But it was useless to regret . It was useless to sigh for the plumed hearse of one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by a taint in the wind were sufficiently near to rally on occasions of sorrow or threatened disgrace . Tides of soberly dressed persons still ebbed and flowed wherever white flowers and purple ribbon muffled a door-bell ; and less than a decade ago the entire connection of Goddards , supported by the friends of the family , had contrived to outflank suspicion in the famous murder of Breverton Goddard . Everybody , even his relatives , believed that the nephew ( General Archbald could n't think of his name now ) had shot Breverton in a quarrel over the uncle 's wife , who was thirty years or more too young for her husband . Gossip had buzzed on as loud as a deafened ear ; but the Goddards , who were connected with all the best people in Queenborough , had united in the heroic pretense that plain murder was pure accident . By force of superior importance , they had ignored facts , defended family honour , shielded a murderer for the sake of saving a name , turned public execration into sympathy , and politely but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade ago ; yet could any family connection , the old man asked himself , win so complete a conquestto-day ? Or , indeed , any conquest at all ? People , even the best people , were more selfish now , and fought only when their material interests were menaced . Though the present was softer than the past , he could n't see that it was an improvementexcept in the way one could turn on a bath or a light , or warm one 's self through and through instead of merely toasting one'sp175front or back by a fire . Certainly , it seemed to him , the young were more insolent and the old more exacting . Wildness there had been always , and would be always , he supposed , only the vague wildness of Jenny Blair lacked , he felt , both dignity and direction . To be sure , as Jenny Blair was too apt to retort , we were living in the twentieth century , and ideas were modern . Modern , yes , but there had been modern ideas in every age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grandfather , " Jenny Blair said in a low voice , " I met Mr. Birdsong , and he looked so dreadfully tired . He has n't had any sleep for three nights . Is that because Mrs. Birdsong is in danger ? " The General sighed . " Yes , she is in danger , my child , but we must hope for the best . " " Do n't you believe she will get well ? " " I hope so , my dear . " " Was n't she the most beautiful woman in Virginia , Grandfather ? " " She is , my child , the most beautiful woman in Virginia or anywhere else . " Jenny Blair sighed . " It must be lovely to be so beauti-ful . " " You , my dear , are pretty enough . " " Is anybody , I wonder , ever pretty enough ? " " For me , you are . I should n't sigh if I were you . Great beauty is not always a blessing . Sometimes it seems only to invite tragic circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated softly , raising her wistful glance to the sky . While he slackened his pace and leaned a bit more heavily on his walking-stick , he asked himself if she would hold her own after the freshness of youth had passed , as well as her mother , who had much character but little temperament , had been able to do . Her complexionwas lovely now , with its faint rose and honeypallor ; but that flowerlike skin of the Wellfleets was disposed , he knew , to wither early . Would her soft flaxen hair fade and darken to a dingy fawn-colour ? Who knows , he thought , flinching from a thread of pain in his hip . Who knows anything ? The present was hers ; the past and the future belong only to life . " Now , she is the freshest thing in the world , " he thought , " and there are men who find freshness more intoxicating than beauty . " " She was very much in love , was n't she , Grandfather ? " Jenny Blair asked after a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She is very much in love , Jenny Blair . " Why , he wondered , did the child persist in using the wrong tense ? For no one , not even Jenny Blair , with her childish perversity and her moist geranium mouth , seemed to him so indestructible in charm as Eva Birdsong . Youthful , too , not in appearance alone , though she was , in his eyes , as clear and brilliant as she had ever been , but in mind , in heart , in some effervescent fountain of life . Yet Jenny Blair , he suspected , and the suspicion pricked like ap177thorn , was already assuming the faintly arrogant manner , the air of secret wisdom , with which inexperiencesurveys the mistakes of experience . Glancing down on the wreath of cornflowers and the sheer crown of Jenny Blair 's hat , he told himself , in exasperation , that he really knew nothing about her . Nothing . Only that she was young and pretty ( people had not thought highly of mere prettiness a generation ago ) and sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Queenborough that had forgotten the famous beauties of the nineteenth century . But these qualities or defects were on the surface , and he knew as little of her inner life as a man could know of a granddaughter who had grown up in his house . True , he loved her devotedly , more devotedlythan he loved Isabella or Etta , though not so deeply as he had loved his only son , Jenny Blair 's father . Yet his preference for her may have sprung only from the sentimental appeal which made him , and all other civilized men , tender to the small , the young , the helpless , the immature . Was this fondness akin to his aging solicitude for babies too young to walk and birds just out of the nest ? No , there was , he felt , a stronger bond than mere sentimentality . For he realized that the difference which separated him from his daughters was an actual diversity . Ages were scarcely involved in it , nor were alterations in manners . In many ways , indeed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etta and Isabella appeared to him to be little deeper than air-plants by nature ; they lived so entirely in feeling that they were devoid of conviction , and their inconsequential beliefs were as variable as moods . " They always want ; they never think , " he reflected . Though Jenny Blair wanted , too , she wanted , he mused sadly , not with her emotions alone , but with what passed for her mind also . She craved more than satisfied desire , for she craved the freedom to seek . If he searched far enough into his past , he might find some blighted intimation of his granddaughter 's perversity . Something within himself , some impulse of wildness , had always longed , he realized , to be free , to be selfish , to live its own life untrammelled by consideration for others . But even this much , he told himself , was conjecture . He knew as little of Jenny Blair 's hidden self as he knew of the intimate nature of the universe . His gaze roved from the girl at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asphalt was replacing the fine old red of the brick pavement . Neutral , he thought indignantly . That was the way modern life compared to the variegated hues of the past , as neutral as asphalt . Here and there a dignified Georgian house retreated , like an aristocrat of architecture , from inferior associates . It was pathetic , he told himself , to see WashingtonStreet sink down to the level of boarding-houses and shops , as the relict of a Confederate general might fall into honourable but neglected adversity . A black and white cat strolled across the pavement in front of William , looked round in angry astonishment , and sprang ,  |p179s|pitting  , to the top of a fencethe sort of cat that mouses along the steep decline of gentility . A woman in a motor coat and one of the small motor hats all old men dislike , came out of a gate and bowed to him as she crossed the pavement to her touring car . A poor exchange , he thought , for the graceful victoria in which every beauty of the eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purr of approaching motor cars , he heard the lifted notes of Jenny Blair 's voice , as clear as a flute and as deficient in suavity . Even the sounds of the present , and certainly the smells , were less romantic than they used to be . " What did you say , my dear ? I wonder how we live in the midst of this noise and dust . It 's positively stifling . Now that summer is coming , we 'll probably have that stale odour back again . " " You can smell it sometimes in winter , Grandfather , if the windows are open . Aunt Etta says it makes her hay fever worse . " " No doubt , no doubt , poor child . But what were you saying ? " The buzz and purr had subsided , but Jenny Blair 's voice was still high and fluting . Talking against noise . So much of modern life was merely talking against noise . " I was only wondering about Mrs. Birdsong . If she was so beautiful , with that lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life in a small place like Queenborough ? "  | " She fell in love , my dear . You will understand when you 're older . " " But why did she fall in love ? I do n't see why she fell in love , do you ? " " I 'm not a fair judge . No man I 've ever met seemed to me worth losing one 's heart to , much less one 's head also . " The girl 's high tones dropped to a quiver of intensity , " I do n't like fair men . I could never fall in love with any man who has n't dark eyes . " " There are plenty of dark men in Queenborough . There are all sorts of heads here , too , including red ones . Have you ever looked at young Welch , by the way ? He 's a fine boy and will make a good doctor . " " I do n't care . I would n't look at him . I have always , " the girl added crisply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm afraid you 're a fastidious young woman . But red heads are everywhere , and so are Johns . I 've met them in the desert calling themselves Mohammed . " " I do n't care , " the girl repeated , pressing his hand . " I do n't care about men . All I want to do is to live my own life . " She had spoken coyly , but she had spoken . While he listened to this familiar declaration of principles , General Archbald reminded himself that it was futile to expect originality in the ideas of youth . From his earliest years in the obscure thirties , he had heard the immature utter this exact wish in these exact words . Only one other motive appeared as inevitable as the desire of youth top181live its own life , and this was the determined effort of age to nip that desire in the bud . Yet , since he was unpolemicalby nature , he remarked gently , " It is not easy to lead one 's own life , my child . Many have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a habit of making impediments . " " If they 're only circumstances , I do n't mind so much . But I do wish people would n't try to interfere with me . " " What people ? Surely you must know that your mother and I wish only the best for you . " " I know that , Grandfather . I love you and Mamma better than anything in the world ; but I must live my own life . " " Do n't forget that your mother has given up her life to you . She has had only you since your father died . " " Yes , I know she has been splendid . Only now she has forgotten how she felt when she was my age , before she had Father and me to fill her mind . " " If she has forgotten , I have n't , my dear . She wished , like every other inexperienced creature , male or female , man , animal , bird , or fish , to live her own life in her own way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a hand in the situation , and settled matters by making you and your father her life . " Jenny Blair listened respectfully until he had finished . Then she repeated all that she had said before he began , and continued with energy , " There is no use in Mamma 's making me come out next winter in Queenborough . Ip182want to go to New York and study to be an actress . That is the only thing in the world I want to do . You know yourself that you would n't like to give up your career and he a wallflower at dances . Especially if you did n't like boys and were not a girl who made the right sort of appeal . " " Nonsense ! " the General exclaimed . " Stuff and nonsense ! You 'll make the right sort of appeal quick enough if you start going . But you can not imagine , my dear little girl , " he added , with a sense that he was reciting the part of a creed in which he had ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to-day . " Well , that was the way parents had always talked , no matter what they believed ; and though he had long ago discovered that temptation may wriggle like moths into the tightest family cupboards , he reminded himself that , in training the young idea , moral precept is less inflammable than historic example . " But do n't they get into the home too , Grandfather ? " Jenny Blair asked in a tone of wistful sincerity which robbed the question of pertness . " I suppose they do , my child . However , your mother will never consent to your going away and living alone . " " But so many girls are doing it now . It is n't as it used to be when Mamma was young . Things are different now . Nobody objected to Sally Burden 's going to New York to study . " That was true on the surface . Conventions were less exacting , no doubt , than they used to be . But Sally Bur/den , he reflected , was plain , and there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . Plain daughters had been a problem even in the ages of chivalry , and a very little talent had often covereda multitude of physical defects . His granddaughter , however , was not plain . Though her unfinished appearancemight not satisfy an Edwardian taste , she measured up , he felt , to the less elevated standards of our democracy . Many modern faces , he reminded himself the next instant , had this unfinished look , especially the faces of very young women , before years or experience refined the ' edges and deepened the plastic impressions . Modelled too hastily , he thought , so hastily that neither joy nor sorrow has had time to sink through the flesh into the spirit . " Well , there 's time enough to think it over , " he heard himself saying . " Here is the hospital , and I suppose I 'd better go up alone . Will you keep William out in the yard ? No doubt you 'll be able to find a bench somewhere . " They had reached a long drab building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flanked by a sickly row of evergreens . Down the steps a young nurse was hurrying on eager though aching feet in white canvas shoes . " There 's a yard for patients to walk in . I 'll wait for you there , " the girl answered , slipping her fingers through William 's collar as they entered the hospital . " If it 's about her will , " she added , " I 'm afraid I 'll have to wait a very long time . People are always so slow about wills . "  | " No , this has nothing to do with her will . But if you get tired waiting , you 'd better go home without me . " " Oh , I 'll wait , darling Grandfather . Only I hope those poor evergreens have n't anything catching . " Glancing down on her , a moment later , as he was borne upward , he thought wistfully , " How much in a man 's feeling for women depends on whether they are coming toward him or going away ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in his direction . When he is old , he realizes that they are all moving away . That is why , I suppose , they appear , like everything else in life , to diminish with time . "  |p185THROUGH  the window he saw a mist of green and the dying flare of the sun . The white iron bed had been rolled into the middle of the room , and Mrs. Birdsong raised herself on the pillows , as he entered , and held out her hands . Fragile hands they were , a little too thin , a little too worn . Strange how much sooner hands aged than faces , especially delicate hands that have been roughened by work . She was wearing , over her white nightgown , a wrapper of lace and blue silk the colour of her eyes when she smiled . Her hair had slipped from the ribbon that held it back from her shoulders , and a single loose curl hung over a bosom which was still queenly even when unconfined . As pure as alabaster , he thought , gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . There was no woman to compare with her in the formless immaturity of the rising generation . " I have been waiting for you , " she said eagerly . " Oh , I am so glad you have come . " For an instant , while he watched her , it seemed to him that the lost radiance of youth shone in her face . Never had she been more lovely , more flamelike , than she lookedp186since suffering had burned its way through her flesh . Then , with her clinging hand in his grasp , he found himself wondering if this animation were really so natural as it appeared . I lad they given her drugs ? Or was it fever that glowed beneath her transparent skin ? But his eyes were old eyes , not to be trusted . They still looked at life through the iridescent film of a more romantic age . The young laughed at him now , as the young always laugh at their elders . As he himself had laughed at the light morality and the ponderous etiquette of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , day or night , if I had known you wanted me . " His voice quivered , and somethingwithin his breast fluttered and sank down like a tired bird . He could see now , as the glow left her face , all the faint lines traced by sorrow or anxiety about her eyes , and the deeper impression between her finely arched nose ( the nose of a goddess , they had . said in the ' nineties ) and the rich curve of her mouth . Yes , she was yielding , howevergallantly , to the slow deposit of time . " I know you would , " she answered , smiling again . Suddenly it was borne in upon him that she smiled so brightly because it was easier to smile than to weep . While his heart seemed to pause , he told himself that it was wrong to think youth died until age was dead also . A moment before he had thought that love , with its tormentof pity and despair , was over . He had thought of it as a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except in moments of rhapsody , as utterly ended in time.  |p187But  he felt now , without knowing why , that this was a mistake . Nothing was over . Nothing was ended . No , it is not true that love dies , he mused , borne upward on the winged curve of Victorian faithof that morning belief in the rightness of life , the essential goodness of God . " No , it is n't true , " he repeated . " After all , I am a Victorianat heart , and even when the Victorians doubted the existence of God , they still believed in I Es goodness . " The trembling had passed now . A little rest was all that he needed . Old arteries were as inelastic as old habits . But the sinking back on belief , on some confident affirmation of life , rippled in flashes of energy through his mind . If only the smile would not twist in pain on her lips . When her smile faded , the lines between nose and chin tightened austerely , and her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly pinched and straight . He remembered that some persons ( his daughter-in-law was one of these ) insisted that Eva Birdsongwas close . But how could she have lived at all , he demanded , if she had spent herself lavishly ? It was true that she was more saving , more sparing , than Cora . Yet he , for one , could not blame her . If ever a woman had an excuse for saving , for nagging If ever a womanhad an excuse " It will soon be over now , " he said cheerfully . " What 's his namethe doctor " His voice wavered angrily , while he felt himself floundering in the desolation of age . " I know his name as well as I know my own . But I ca n't think of it now when I want it . I 'm getting too old , Eva.  | I 'm getting too old , and I 'm not reconciled to forgetting . Not to forgetting names I know as well as my own . " " Bridges , " she said softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've known him all his life . I went to school with his father , and yet his name went out of my mind like that when I wanted it . " For an instant , no longer , it seemed to him that every other misfortune was dwarfed , was blotted out , by the tragedy of the old . By growing infirm , by fumbling for things , by forgetting names that you know as well as your own . " In a few months , he says , you 'll feel better than ever . " " Yes , he says so , but it is n't that . I 'm not worrying about that . " " Then what is it , my dear ? What is it ? " She turned toward the sunset , and he saw that she was still beautiful . The thin cheeks , the pinched nostrils , the silver lustre on her bronze hair made no difference . Nothingon the surface could alter the serene integrity of her loveliness . While the glow from the sky transfigured her , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pure outline of legend . " Even when she is dead , " he thought , " her skeleton will have beauty . " Aloud he repeated tenderly , " What is it , my dear ? " " I 'm not afraid of dying , " she said slowly , and her words were as empty as the April breeze that stirred the lace on her bosom . " Thank God , there is n't any danger of that , " he maintainedstoutly . The chair felt very small , and he shifted his weight.  | " But nobody knows what may happen . I want you to stay with George until it is over . I want you to come in the morning and stay with George . " " I 'll be here . You know I 'd be here even if you had n't asked me . " Her arm , with the blue sleeve falling away , lay on the coverlet , and he reached out his trembling hand and stroked it softly from elbow to wrist . How delicate her skin looked beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , he thought in disgust ; his skin beside hers was as harsh and rough as the bark of a tree . " I promise to stay with him . I 'll be here with him the whole time . But it wo n't be long . They tell me it will all be over within an hour . " " They do n't know . They do n't know anything . " " Well , you 'll have that boy , John Welch , with you . He will help Bridges , and he worships you , Eva . " " Yes , he 's a good boy , and George " She broke offand began again , " George has been wonderful . " " I never doubted that . You 've been the apple of his eye since you were as young as Jenny Blair . " " He has n't had any sleep since I was taken ill . Every night he has sat up with me . It has been terrible for him . I sometimes think it has been harder for him than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . He has been wonderful . " " He would be , my child . I used to tell him that he must have been born in a crisis . Do you remember the time I was caught in that panic , and George was the first man to stand by me ? If I 'd let him , he would have turned over every penny he had . " Drawing out his white silk handkerchief , on which Mrs. Archbald had embroidered his monogram , he blew his nose and furtively wiped the moisture from his eye . Strange that age should be so much more sentimental than youth ! " That is the kind of thing , " he added , " that stays by a man till the end . " Her face brightened . " I remember . That was before we lost our money . " " Well , as long as I have a penny left , my dear , it is yours . You wo n't deny me that privilege ? " She smiled at his courtliness . " You are always generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You ca n't have all the virtues . That would n't be fair . " Her smile changed to a laugh . " Have you ever expectedus to be fair ? Have you ever expected life to be fair ? " " I am not sure . " He was trying desperately to preserve the gaiety , though he knew it was only the false gaiety that thrives in hospitals . " Anyhow , women are life , are n't they , for most of us ? " " I think , " she answered , and the thought , he could see , spun in her mind like a slowly revolving wheel to which she was bound , " that I have really made George 's life . " " You could n't have helped it . He loves you too much . " " Yes , he loves me . He has always loved me . " Her voice was so quiet and detached that she seemed to be listening for an echo . " If I had n't believed that he loved me , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have borne being poor . " " I could n't have borneeverything . " " It has been hard for you , I know . You were not made to pinch and scrape . " " If I had n't known that he loved me , " she repeated , as if he had not spoken , " I could n't have borne everything . " " But you never doubted . You had no reason to doubt . " " So you feel that ? You understand ? Nobody else does . " " You ought n't to say that . All your friends under-stand . " " As long as there is love , " she continued , thinking aloud , and excited ( the suspicion crossed his mind ) by the drugs they had given her , " a woman can forgive anything . A man can be amused in strange ways , I understand that , though some women can not . But if it were realif it were not just amusementif it were real She broke off with a shiver , and threw him a frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured in a voice that ran like a thread of pain through his nerves , " So often , too , it is kindness . It is nothing more than trying to help people . You and I know that George has the kindest heart in the world . " " He would strip himself of his coat for a friendor even for a stranger who was colder than he was . I have often said that he is generous to extravagance . " After all , that was true , that was just , and he delighted to praise George when he could . " To extravagance ! You are right . Over and over again designing persons have taken advantage of him , and he has been too proud to explain to anybody but me . Do you remember the night he was taken so ill in thatthat dreadful place , and they sent for us because they thought he was dying ? " " Do n't think of that . It is n't worth thinking of . " For he remembered the night only too well . Hastily summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring George home or to be near him at the end . Afterwards there had been a great deal of gossip . They had found George unconscious ( ptomaine poisoning , Bridges had said ) . Well , even in memory , it was an ugly picture . A kaleidoscopic blur assailed himpaper roses , plush furniture , pink shades , and straw-coloured hair . The woman had managed to dress George before she summoned a doctor , and Bridges had picked up a pair of socks and stuffed them into his pocket . It was the last place on earth George would ever wish to see Eva ; but after she heard he was in danger , there was nothing anybody could do with her . Self-willed , beneath all her softness . Why , he had seen her become unmanageable when her primitive emotions rushed to the surface . That night , she had been frantic at first , going suddenly quiet , as still as marble , as soon as they ceased to oppose her . But it was an occasion of horror for them all , indecent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known only to religion and lust , the shadow of death or the substance of scandal worked , temporarily at least , a miracle of reform . For several years after that George had appearedp193to reform , or at least to refrain . Then , when his health was restored , nature again had its way with him . His exuberant vitality overflowed afresh into the old channels . Yes , Eva was right . It was George 's impulse to spend himself , somehow , anyhow , just as it might be another'simpulse to spare himself and to save . But John Welch , who had the straight outlook of science , showed little patience with George . " No man has a right to make a muddle of life , " he had said , and then bitterly , " God ! how I hate a muddle ! " And Eva ? What had she really thought under her long patience ? Though her bearing may not have been natural , it was , the old man admitted , heroic . The code of perfect behaviour supported her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by word or gesture , never by so much as a look , had she betrayed herself . All that had happenedten years before , and this was the first allusion , so far as the General knew , she had ever made to the old scandal . Now , while he watched her , a thin , faint rose drifted into her cheeks , as if they were stained by the sunset . She had raised herself on her arm , and the blue silk fell away from the curve of her elbow . Though she was looking beyond him to the broken clouds in the west , he could see that her eyes were dark with pain above that still smile on her lips . Then the last edge of the sun vanished in a red rim below the horizon , and at the same instant her smile wavered and died . " I have always wanted to tell you that he was not to blame that night , " she said very slowly . " He was there trying to help her . It was about a will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know this . I want you to believe this . " She stopped , choked a moment , and asked in a breathless whisper , " You do believe what I tell you ? " " Yes , I believe you . " " I felt that I wanted you to know , " she continued , after a long pause in which he heard the spasmodic rise and fall of her breath . " One can never tell what may happen . If I should die before George , I want you to know howhow splendid he has been . I want you to be his friend always . " " Of course I am his friend , and , most of all , I am your friend . Nothing can change that . " " No , nothing can change that . " She had fallen back on the pillows , and lay looking out at the shadowy branches of elms against the vivid light of the afterglow . " You are like George in some ways , " she added presently , " and in others so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same in all of us , my dear . " " It is n't just human nature . There 's something more . John Welch has human nature , too , but there 's nothing of you in him , and there 's nothing of George . " " Well , that does n't keep him from being a fine lad . As I 've told you before , I sometimes wish my little girl could take a fancy to him . It would not be a brilliant marriage , but he would make a good husband , if character counts . "  |p195Eva  sighed vaguely , listening to the soft April wind in the trees . " Yes , he 's a fine boy . I 'm very fond of John ; but he is n't the kind a young girl falls in love with . Somehow , he is tootoo honestand perhaps too unselfish . It takes more than character to awaken loveespecially first love . " Suddenly , without a sound , her tears brimmed over , and failing to find the handkerchief under her pillow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't cry . Do n't cry , " pleaded the old man . " There is nothing in the world for you to cry about , Eva . " " I know there is n't . Nothing in the world , " she responded , while her tears flowed all the faster . " It 's just nerves . Doctor Bridges and John tell me so . It is just nerves . " When he drew out his silk handkerchief and put it on the coverlet , she caught it up and hid her face for an instant . Turning away from her , he looked over the small neglected garden to the scattered spires of Queenborough . Everywhere it is the same , he thought . Everywhere people are loving , suffering , hating , hoping , going into hospitals , coming out of hospitals , laughing , weeping , tryingfruitlessly to make life what it is not . All the striving for an impossible happiness , for an ecstasy that endures . All the long waiting , the vain prayers , the hope that is agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? Who knows that the end ever comes ? But what we see and touch cannotbe the whole of it . There must be a plan , there must be a meaning , he insisted , still faithful to a creed he had forsaken . All life is n't lived in a hospital . For the young there is joy somewhere , and for the old there is the end of expectancy and a green bench in the sunshine . Presently , while he still gazed out of the window , he felt her hand close on his , and turning quickly , he saw that not only her lips but her eyes were smiling up at him . A moment before she had seemed to lose courage , and his heart had sunk down in despair ; but now , with the change in her look , he felt that he was able to face life again . " I ought to know all about first love , " she said brightly , " because I fell in love with George when I was eight years old . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could , " Well , I 'm glad they do n't all begin so soon , my dear . " Almost , but not quite , he had touched the inside curve of her elbow . Then , with his eyes on the winepurpleveins and swollen joints of his hand , he drew back and grasped the crook of his walking-stick . No , the hands of youth and age could not clasp without flinching . Yet Jenny Blair , God bless her , thought of forty-two as the downward turn . Well , no matter . If one had to be eightythree , it was better to be eighty-three alone with the past . " Oh , that was long before he thought of me . " She was laughing with her old archness , and he told himself that the music of chimes was in the sound of her voice . " It beganwhen he plunged into that burning shanty down near Penitentiary Bottom and brought out Memoria . George was only a small boy then , but I fell in love with him , and I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendousappeal to me , even when I was a child . Some/how , I saw him after that always rushing into flame and smoke and rushing out again with a bundle in his arms . You remember Memoria , who does our washing ? Of course the firemen could have saved her as well ; but George would n't wait for the fire engine . That was exactly like him , was n't it ? He can never bear to wait when an impulse seizes him . " " Yes , yes , I know , but you ought n't to have been there . You were too small . " " That 's what Mother said ; but Mammy was Memoria 's grandmother . We were playing out in the street , and when Mammy heard the fire-bells , she ran down as fast as she could , and all the children followed her . I would n't have missed it for anything in the world . It was the first time I ever saw Memoria . She could n't have been more than three years old , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , but are n't you talking too much ? " He flinched and shifted his heavy body , which had once been hard as nails , he told himself , but was now soft and flabby . " Are you in pain ? " she asked , laying her hand on his arm . " A twinge in my joint . All my age seems to have got down at last to my legs . I was telling Jenny Blair on the way up here that I 'd be as sound as I ever was if I had a new pair of legs . " She was silent so long that he began to wonder if she had forgotten him or had fallen asleep from fatigue . Nothing , he decided , while he waited , but the false excitement of drugs could have broken down her reserve so completely . When , at last , she spoke again , it was in the low wandering tone in which one muses aloud . " No , I would n't have missed it for anything . Mammy lost her head when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Memoria was her grandchild . All the children on the block ran down as fast as they could . The alarm was ringingover the city , and presently the fire engine came dashingdown the hill , with all the splendid white horses . There was a crowd of negroes praying and shouting in front of the house , and Memoria 's mother was shrieking that she had forgotten her baby . She had saved her spring hat , her best set of plates , her sewing-machine , and even a bushel of black-eyed peas ; but she had forgotten that Memoria was asleep in a trundle bed . Afterwards , she said she thought Memoria was with the other children out in the yard ; but I believe she had simply forgotten her in the excitement . " " You were too little , " he said . " You ought not to have been there . " " Oh , but nothing so exciting as that ever happened to me again . Only , like Memoria 's mother , the things I recallmost vividly are trifles . My mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . I remember I was wearing a sprigged cambric , white and pink , and ribbed white socks , with a pair of shiny black slippers , tied . with a bow of grosgrain ribbon over the instep . These are thep199things I remember best , and the way George ran down from a vacant lot , with a ball in his hand . He had been playing baseball , and there was a long jagged tear in his breeches where he had climbed over a fence . I have never forgotten the look of that tear and the bows on my new slippers . Is there any meaning in memory , I wonder . " " Who knows ? The things I recollect best happened forty years and more ago . But you must n't let yourself talk too long . If you get excited , you wo n't sleep . " " He came running down with the other boys , " she resumed , as if there had been no interruption , " and Memoria 's mother shrieked at him , I'se done lef ' my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my baby ! ' George shook her hand off his arm and called out over the prayingand shouting , Well , I 'll get her , Cindy . Just hold my ball for me . ' Would you believe it ? " Eva asked suddenly , with a laugh of pure happiness . " Cindy stood there rockingthe baseball as if it were a baby the whole time George was bringing out Memoria . She stood there swinging the ball back and forth in her arms , and screaming at the top of her voice , Oh , Lawd , I'se a sinner ! Oh , Lawd , I'se a sinner , but I ain ' gwine sin no mo ' ! ' Then George came out of the smoke and threw a flannel bundle ( he had rolled up Memoria in a blanket ) into Cindy 's arms . Give me my ball , ' he said , just like that . Give me my ball . ' He ran back to the vacant lot at the very instant the fire engines came rushing down the steep street . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to me again . But I fell in lovep200with George then , and I never got over it . I think the thing I really loved him for was his courage . Courage has a lasting quality , " she added , and for the first time her voice trembled with feeling . " Sometimes I think it is the only virtue that has a lasting quality . " " Perhaps you 're right , " he answered , and wondered if it were true . " Anyhow , it is well to love people for the sake of virtues that stay by one . " " That is what I mean . That is what I am trying to tell you . " She spoke eagerly , grasping his tired old hand as it lay on the coverlet . " I do n't know how to put it into words , but this something that stays by you makes last love more important than first love to . a woman . And it is even stronger when it is all one love , first and last , like mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you and your lover , and it changes as everything must that exists merely between two human beings . But last love has courage in it also ; it has courage and finality , and facing the end and all the emptiness that is life . Finality is the only thing , is n't it , that really survives ? Everything else , even love , passes . " Her face was pale in the thickening dusk , and her eyes shone like blue fires as she looked up at him . What was she trying to tell him ? How much did she suspect ? How much did she know ? How much had she always known ? " Do n't ask me , my child . I can not answer . " He sighed under his breath , realizing that he looked on a last gallant endeavour to defend an illusion . Yes , he was right when he said that hers had been , and no doubt was still , a greatp201passion . And was he right , too , when he thought that women had passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were not poets ) had only passions ? " That is what I had in my mind to tell you , " she repeated , though she had told him nothing . " If anything should happen to me , I want you to feel that George has beenhas been splendid . You do feel that now , do n't you ? " " Yes , my dear , I feel that now . " " I made an excuse to John about my will , though , after all , I have only a few trinkets to leave . Most of my jewels I sold without telling George , and I even sold every piece of Mother 's silver that we were n't obliged to use on the table . After the coffee service went , I used to take the goblets and forks and spoons down , one at a time , to old Mr. Mapleson . He never gave me away . Even Oeorge has never . suspected , because I saved those six Georgian goblets Grandfather always used for mint juleps . And I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am telling you now . Perhaps it is all the morphine I 've taken , but something seems to have broken down in me . All the walls have been swept away , and I ca n't divide my mind into compartments . But I want Jenny Blair to have my aquamarine necklace and earrings . They are n't valuable ; but she has always liked them , and the setting is good . " Though her eyes were dry and shining , he felt the tears brim over his withered eyelids and roll unchecked down the furrowed skin of his cheek . Yes , there are cracks even in stone , he thought . " You told me your silver was in the bank , " he said , and wondered , in spite of his pity , if her confession were as natural , as impulsive , as he had believed . " I could n't bear you to know . That was false pride , I suppose , but it has always been stronger in me than anything else . " " Well , you ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as to be needed . " The desire to talk of himself , to pour out his interminable disappointments , shuddered through his nerves in a spasm of longing . He had much to tell , and it seemed to him that from any point of view what he had to tell would be interesting . He had suffered deeply ; he had had wide experience ; he had lived through dramatic epochs in the world 's history ; he had observed ; he had reflected ; he had gathered , little by little , the long wisdom of eighty-three years . If only once he might open his closed soul and let the past gush out in a torrent of memory ! But she was n't thinking of him . Nobody was thinking of him except as a prop in weakness , a pillar to lean against . No matter how he had suffered , no matter how much talking might help him , there was n't anybody who cared to sit down and listen . " I do n't know what we should have done without you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice was listless , the blue flames had died down in her eyes , and her clinging hand felt cold and limp in his grasp.  | " You 've talked too much , " he answered . " I 'd better be going . " The door opened , and a nurse bearing a tray came in briskly . She was tall , thin , active , and moved as if she were strung on wires beneath her starched uniform . " It is time for your nourishment now , " she said , with the artificial cheerfulness of a hospital or a nursery . " I hope you feel that you are going to have a good night . " With an expert touch , she beat the pillows , arranged them at Mrs. Birdsong 's back , and placed the tray on a little bed-table over her knees . " If you sip the milk very slowly , it will do you more good . " Eva glanced from the nurse to the old man , who had risen and was waiting to leave . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Was the nurse really so'sanguine as she looked ? GeneralArchbald wondered , trembling a little from the twinge of pain that shot through his right leg at the knee . Or was her cheerfulnys also strung on wires underneath ? As she bent over to stretch the coverlet under the bed-table , he saw that her reddish-black hair was grey at the roots . Trying to keep up an appearance , he supposed , moved by some stern compulsion to pretend that life was something she knew it was not . " She 's going to be all right , Miss Summers , is n't she ? " he asked . " Oh , perfectly all right ! " The nurse 's accents were more than cheerful , they were almost jubilant , as if she were singing in chorus . " It is n't really so bad , you know.  |p204The  whole thing will be over soon , and in a few months she will feel as well as she ever felt in her life . I have a friend Doctor Bridges operated on for this same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl afterwards . It is n't serious . Not really . Nothing is so serious as people think , " added the nurse , who knew , because she had a mother dying of cancer and a father serving a life sentencein prison . " You hear that , my dear ? " the General said , but he was unable to sustain the pitch of Miss Summers ' sprightliness . " Yes , I hear , " Eva replied indifferently . The light had ebbed from her face , and she looked wan and tired and almost old . " I hear , but there are times when I am worn out with hoping . I 've hoped too much in my life . " " There , now , you 're letting yourself droop again , " Miss Summers remonstrated . " You must try to fix your thoughts on pleasant things . Nothing is so bad for you as depression . " " I 'd better go , " the General repeated . " I 've let her talk too much . Old men are like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep well , my dear , and remember I 'll be here the first thing in the morning . " She looked up over the glass of milk . " Nine o'clock is the hour , is n't it , Miss Summers ? " " Yes , nine o'clock . I always like my patients to be first . Then it 's over before you begin to expect it . " She had a gold eyetooth which flashed when she smiled  | " And you 'll stay with George ? You wo n't leave him ? " Eva was clinging to the hand he held out . He stooped to kiss her cheek . " Not for a minute . John Welch will see you through . Where is John ? " " He was here just before you came . Nobody knows how good he has been . " As he was turning away , she caught his sleeve and asked in a tone that was faintly hysterical , " You wo n't forget ? " " I sha n't forget . Take the rest of your milk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked hurriedly to the door , and without looking back , shut it after him when he went out into the long and narrow hall . Through the window at the end he could see the paling afterglow , and from this afterglow a thick shadow approached him . Then the electric light flashed on , and he saw that the shadow was John Welch . " I could n't see you against the light , John . " Grasping his arm , he drew him farther away from Eva 's door into the sun-room , where a few friends of patients were waiting . As he entered , they glanced at him curiously over old magazines , every eye rolling automatically in his direction , and he noticed that all the faces wore the same look of vacant expectancy . Turning hastily from the room , he walked to the farther end of the hall . " I am anxious , John , " he said in a shaken voice . " I ca n't help feeling anxious . But I suppose the nurse is right when she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Oh , of course she would . " His face was drawn and sallow , as if he had not slept , and there was a frown beneath his still flaming crest . While he looked at him General Archbald remembered that John had once called the romantic mind " disorderly . " But that was his favourite criticism . All emotion , even a love of beauty , seemed disorderly to him , and his ideal world had all the clean bareness of a laboratory or a tiled bathroom . A fine character , no doubt . Yes , certainly a fine character if it is possible to make character according to formula . " I do n't know how simple , " John continued , lowering his voice until his words were almost inaudible . " She has a fifty-fifty chance , I should say . Her heart is n't quite so strong as it ought to be , but her kidneys are sound . " The General stared back mutely , while he moistened his lips which felt suddenly blistered . It was distressing , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken of as plainly as if they were blocks of wood . Young people were more direct than they used to be , and he knew that John , after the habit of all realists in every age , disliked sentimentality . Well , perhaps he was right . There was no doubt that he loved Mrs. Birdsong devotedly , though he was able to stand by and watch a surgeon cut into her body . He was clean , competent , and as hard as nails even in his affection . " I 'm not sure , " the old man thought , " that it is n't the better way . Wherever there is softness , life is certain to leave its scar . " Glancingover his shoulder at the vases of flowers which had been placed outside the doors for the night , he asked in a muffled tone , " Everything , then , is in her favour ? "  |p207John  nodded . He had pleasant , sharply cut features , with lips that were too thin and tight beneath the reddish shade of a moustache . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change colour , and his face was not , the General thought , unattractive . If only he would smile frequently , any girl might be forgiven for falling in love with him . But he smiled very seldom , only when he meant it , and he was not smiling now . " Everything , " he replied , " except that worry . There 's something on her mind . You know how secretive she is . " The other 's assent was scarcely more than a sigh . " I think you 'll find her easier . She talked to me very frankly . " " I am glad of that . For weeks , for years , I suppose , she has been worrying . She has gone round and round in her mind , like a squirrel in a cage , but not a word has escaped . All the conditions of her life are unnatural . I honestly believe , " he burst out harshly , " teat she has never drawn a natural breath since she was married . If she dies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be the long pretenseof her life that has killed her . " The old man glanced nervously down the deserted hall . " I understand that better than you can . We were brought up that way . It was part of the code . " John 's thin lips curled , and the General expected a laugh . But none came . Instead , the young man merely muttered under his breath , " And no doubt the code takes care of George too ? " " Not entirely ; but George has his points , you know . "  | " I admit that . God knows , I 'm no moralist , but I dislikea muddle . I dislike aa disorderly world . " " It 's easy to blame George , " the old man rejoined sadly . " All of us are ready to do that , but we must remember that the wrong side of his life has had nothing whatever to do withwith his marriage . " John glared at him . " The devil it has n't ! " he exclaimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm no moralist . I 'll look in on Cousin Eva again before she goes to sleep . " There was an abrupt , angry note in his voice ; but , then , as the General reflected , John was always a little abrupt . That was why he could never really talk to him . It would be easier to talk of himself to George , who was unstable and sympathetic , than to John , who was hard and sincere . Again he was convulsed by the longing to speak of himself , to let the past gush out in a torrent of memory . But what could he tell ? What was left of his joy , his anguish , and his despair ? No , there was nothing he could put into words . Nothing had ever happened to him . Nothingbut life ; and life had happened to all persons everywhereunder the sun . He felt dazed and tremulous , and it seemed to him that his will to live was spinning down , Iike a top that revolves more and more slowly before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to himself , in a futile effort to restorehis equilibrium , " I suppose fortitude will be the last thing to go . "  |p209As  JENNY BLAIR went out into the yard , spring rushed to meet her , and she thought , with wistful vagueness , " I wish I knew what I wanted ! " The breeze on her cheek and the scent of pale spring flowers made her restless . Though the ground near the house was bare , an uneven border of jonquils trailed beside the new asphalt walk , and the cool afternoon shadows spread like pleated silk under the magnolia trees by the gate . Between the walk and the gate , the unmown grass was sprinkled with small white heads of clover , and all the clover blossoms and the fringed grasses seemed to be running before the wind . Suddenly , the whole world , even the magnolias and the shadows , joined in the race . The April afternoon was running somewherebut where ? A flushed light was blown into her mind . " Spring is so lovely . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were melting ! " A little ahead of her , William looked back , sniffed the air , and bounded over the jonquils in pursuit of an unattainable scent . Slackening her steps , the girl remembered , with a stab of reproach , that Mrs. Birdsong was very ill and might die . " It is too dreadful , " she added in a whisper . " It would be too dreadful to die in the spring . " But the thought was as empty as her voice . No matter how hard she tried , she could not make herself feel that illness and death really touched her . She could not believe that anything in the world mattered , except to be alive and to know what she wanted from life . She adored Mrs. Birdsong . She adored her so passionately that it was impossible to associate her with illness or death . " God would n't let it happen to her , " she said , putting the fear out of her mind . " God would n't let her suffer like that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promise of joy that glittered in the vaguenessahead . At one moment she longed to go away from Queenboroughto go anywhere . But immediately afterwards , she would think of her grandfather , too old and feeble to do more than sit in the sun and think about nothing . What could he have to think about since he had given up law ? And her mother would miss her , too , she reminded herself . Her poor mother had had , as everybodysaid , a sad life , though her sad life had failed , apparently , to make her unhappy . " If only I knew what I wanted , " Jenny Blair sighed . again ; for it had occurred to her that what she really wanted most was something beyond her reachsomethingas far away as the moon . " Perhaps , if they were to say I could go , I should n't wish ever to leave them . " At the end of the yard , she came upon a roofless summer-housesmothered in ivy , and when the smoke of ap211cigar drifted to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew all the time he was waiting . " Without surprise , she felt that she had been coming all her life down this walk to the summer-house where she expected to find him . " Thank God , it 's you , Jenny Blair ! " George Birdsong exclaimed , as he caught sight of her . " I was afraid to turn when I heard you coming . Since I stole out for a smoke , I 've had to ward off the advances of two nurses and four patients . " He looked harassed and miserable , and there was an anxious question in his usually smiling eyes . Even his skin , which she had thought so fresh and clear , was darkened by smudges of pain and fatigue . Everything about him , from his light chestnut hair , so thick and upspringing that it seemed blown back on his head , to the short curve of his upper lip under the faint moustache , looked dejectedand listless . Even his hard , strong body appeared to have given way and softened within from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , not in her heart alone , but deeper , far ieeper . She longed to put her head down on the railing of the summer-house and burst into tears . About what ? She did not know . Only she could have wept because something too brilliant to be true was blurred and tarnished by suffering . Yet she could n't tell why she suffered like this . It was all as vague as the rest of her discontent . " Do you mind me ? " she asked . " I am so sorry . I am waiting for Grandfather . "  | " No , I 'm glad you came . " He was still standing beside the bench from which he had risen . " It will do me good to talk to you . I am smoking because I have to . I 've lost my nerve , and I have to hold on to something , if it 's no bigger than a cigar . " " Yes , I know . I feel that way too . " She sat down stiffly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his place . The smell of his cigar made everything more alive , and she remembered that Grandfather had said a man could always smoke himself into submission to fate . That was when Doctor Bridges had taken away his pipe because of a cough . She could n't say it aloud to anybody older than John Welch , but she wished women in Queenboroughwould begin smoking in public and not just up the chimney , as Aunt Etta had always done . " I have n't had a wink of sleep for two nights and scarcely any for a week , " Mr. Birdsong said , and his tone sounded hurt and astonished , as if he were protesting against an injustice . " How can I sleep when Eva is going through hell ? I was afraid to drop off lest she should wake up and want me . And now my nerves are all shot to pieces . Do n't get the idea I 've been drinking . I have n't . I have n't touched a drop , and I 'm not going to touch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corner of the rustic bench , Jenny Blair stared at him with eyes that she felt were expressionless . Though she was aching with sympathy , she could think of nothing to say that seemed right in her mind . Never before had she seen him stripped of his charm ,  |p213his  gaiety , his effervescent good-humour . Yet , in some strange way she could n't explain , she found that she liked him better when he appeared merely human and suffering . " You 're sure you do n't mind my talking ? " he asked abruptly . " It makes it easier for me if I can talk to somebody . I have to get away from things . I 'm not like a woman . " " Women want to get away too . " " No , you 're wrong about that . " She could see that he was not interested in the point . " You do n't know anything about women . Not yet . Women like to sit down with trouble as if it were knitting . But men are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or the other . Is your grandfather in the hospital ? " " Yes , she wanted to see him alone . That 's why I 'm keeping William . Where 's William ? " She glanced round the garden , and at the sound of his name , William came , with his tongue lolling out , and stretched himself on a bed of grasses and clover . " I hope , " she added in a tone softened to affliction , " that it is n't really serious . " He had finished one cigar and was immediately beginninganother . " You do n't know what you are talking about , " he replied , and she noticed that the fingers with which he struck a match were shaking . " Everything like that is serious . And it 's Eva ! " He almost cried the words in his agony . " It 's Eva ! I know I ought n't to talk to you like this . Do n't listen to me . You 're only a child . " " I 'm seventeen and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you understand . You always understood things . " She looked at him gravely , still speaking in the firm and soothing tone she had learned from her mother . " I do n't think you bear trouble as well as she does . " " As Eva ? Of course I do n't . If I could go away or take a drink , I should n't keep on smoking one cigar after an-other . " " Then why do n't you go away or take a drink ? " He answered with a gesture of irritation . " I told her I 'd stay by her and not touch a drop , and I 'm going to keep my word . I 'm going to keep my word to her once . If I were to go home , even for a minute , the temptation might be too strong for me . The best thing I can do is to sit here until your grandfather goes and they send for me . " I wish I could help . " " You 're helping just by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people , they would think I was out of my head . But you do n't . " " No , I do n't , " she responded proudly . In spite of her effort to sound firm and soothing , she was unable to banish a note of triumph . She tried to feel sad and hopelessbecause Mrs. Birdsong , whom she had always adored , was ill and unhappy and a surgeon would be obliged to disfigure her lovely body ; but the regret slipped like quicksilver out of her mind , and the place it had occupiedwas overflowing the next instant with a sensation of surprise and delight . Life was adorable . How she wishedp215everybody in the world could be happy ! " Poor Mrs. Birdsong , " she repeated vacantly to herself . " Poor Mrs. Birdsong ; " and immediately afterwards , she began to wonder if she really wanted to go away . It might be more fun to stay in Queenborough and go to balls and cotillions , and have all the lovely dresses her mother would order from New York and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as old iron , she could see the tall , pale grasses and the white heads of clover racing faster and faster in the April wind , which was scented with Mr. Birdsong 's cigar . And it seemed a part of the spring frolic that the smoke of his cigar should be strangely excitingand mysterious as it drifted about her . Beyond the magnolias , the drab walls of the hospital blotted out the horizon . On the porch , she could see an old lady in a crape veil walking slowly up and down with a man who moved as if his legs did not belong to him . Above , at one of the uncurtained windows , a nurse was reading aloud , and directly over her head , at a higher window , a young woman in a purple kimono was looking out at the sunset . Suddenly , from the dark boughs of a magnolia , a bird sang the same note over twice and was silent . At the bird 's call , it seemed to Jenny Blair that the flying grasses and clover and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raced on again in an ecstasy . But she ought to be sad ; she ought not to share in all the quivering and flying of April . Mrs. Birdsong was ill . Mrs. Birdsong would be given ether in the morning ; she would be put on a table ; she would lie uncon/scious while they cut into her body . " I 'd do anything in the world for her , " thought Jenny Blair , " I know it is terrible . " Yet knowing it was terrible could not keep her from feeling this ecstasy . " I 'd do anything in the world for her , " she repeated aloud . " So would I. I 'd do more than anything . If there were anything to be done , do you think I 'd sit here chewing this cigar likelike an idiot ? " She wondered what reply he expected . Or , since he was talking to relieve his mind , perhaps he did not wish her to speak . " I might be anybody , " she thought . " I might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to listen . It 's strange that men have nerves too . I never knew it before . But I do n't care . He is more attractive , even if he is n't dark , than any boy I know . Yes , I do like older men best . " " There was never a woman to compare with her , " George was saying almost roughly , as if he were contradictingsomebody or something . " I 've seen plenty of women , but I 've never known one that could compare with her . " " That 's what Grandfather says . He thinks she would have been as famous as Mrs. Langtry if she had lived out in the world . " " Well , but for me , she might have been famous . " He smoked in short puffs , with a frown that was half whimsical , half savage , as if he enjoyed hurting himself . " I 'm not worth her little finger . I do n't need anybody to tell me I 'm not worth her little finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is that I have no endurance . I can summonup as much courage as any man ; but I ca n't stand things . " She nodded . " I know . I believe I 'm like that myself . " A laugh broke from him , and his face cleared . " What can you know about it at your age ? You are scarcely more than a child . But , " his features darkened again , " I do n't need anybody to tell me I 'm not worthy of her . " " You will never make her believe that . " His features twitched with that odd expression of helplessinjury . " I do n't know . Nobody will ever find out what she believes . I 'd give my right arm to spare her this ; but the truth is I 'm not good enough . I 've never been good enough to lace her shoes . You will always remember this , wo n't you ? No matter what anybody says , remember I told you I was n't worthy to lace her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her small , flushed face , with its shallow profile , was as sweet and empty as a wild rose ; but she was thinking without softness , " I wonder if he is misunderstood too ? Perhaps she has never really understoodhim . " " It must be wonderful to be as beautiful as she was . " Not until the words had crossed her lips did she realize that she had spoken in the past tense . Well , maybe he had n't noticed it . He seemed to be occupied with his own thoughts . " Grandfather says that nature has lost the art of making queenly women . " " Yes , they seem smaller now , whether they are or not . You 're a mere wisp . " For the first time he looked atp218her searchingly , and a blush stained her face while his glance , so sad and indifferent a moment before , swept from the scalloped waves of soft , pale hair under the brim of her hat to her slender ankles arching trimly from the silver buckles on her suede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you look soft ; but you 're not . All that softness of youth is only a glaze . Touch it , and you 'll find that it is as hard asas glass underneath . " " I 'm not , " she replied angrily . " I 'm not hard . " But when his voice roughened to harshness , a quiver of pleasure shot through her nerves . Why , she wondered , should she like the roughness of his tone better than gentleness ? " But I 'm not , " she repeated , hoping that he would contradict her imperatively and make the sudden change , the quiver of pleasure , begin all over again . " You are . I can tell by looking at you . All that dewiness is just a film . You are like every other girl in the world . No matter what happens so long as it does n't happen to you . " Suffering had faded from his expression , and his features were charged with vitality . Even the dark smudges of pain had vanished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ivy and tossed them into his face . How surprising life was , how thrilling ! Yes , she was positive now that she liked older men best . She liked them when they were not shy and awkward like boys , but imperative and tender and rough altogether . " I 'm not hard , " she tossed at him with the leaves of ivy . " You do n't know . You do n't know everything . "  | " I know you . " " You do n't . " " I do . " The old gay challenge to life shone in his eyes , as if he had found a brief escape from the anxiety that consumed him . " I do n't see how you know so much . I never told you . " What did his look mean ? Did it mean everything ? Did it mean nothing ? " There are things you know without being told . I know something else about you . I know John Welch likes you too much . " She shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never , never , " she insisted audaciously , " fall in love with a fair man . " He threw back his head with a laugh , and the amusementsounded so natural that she glanced nervously at the hospital . Had he forgotten , she wondered , where they were ? No , of course not , he could scarcely have forgotten his trouble so soon . " I 'll bet you anything you likeI ' 11 wager a box of marshmallows that you fall in love first of all with a fair man . " " I do n't like marshmallows , " she rejoined , with dignity . " Well , chocolates , then . I wager a box of chocolates againstagainst- " Against what ? " " I 'm trying to think . Whatever you please , because I 'm sure to win . Suppose we say a kiss . That wo n't cost you anything . I should n't like to make you sacrifice a pair of silk stockings . " Though she laughed disdainfully , she felt a tremor of expectation , of imaginary adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I 'm so happy ! I have never been so happy before ! " " That 's the easiest thing for little girls , is n't it ? " he asked in the teasing tone with which her elders used to annoy her when she was a child . " But I do n't like kissing , " she replied severely . " It is silly . " Through the ivy , she still watched the light on the blown grasses and clover , and it seemed to her that this light was both without and within , that it was as livingas music . " You do n't , eh ? Well , you used to when you were small . " His voice sounded rough again , almost as if he were angry , and he was staring hard straight away from her at the walls of the hospital . " I used to like marshmallows too . " Provoked because he would not look at her , she rose to her feet and flicked at his hand with the fringe of her small beaded bag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person you 're talking to . " " You do n't like it , eh ? " he repeated in that queer brusque tone , while he slipped his arm about her and drew her to his side . For an instant he was so close that she felt his hardness and strength , as if he had turned to a figure of bone and muscle . Even his lips were hard and rough as they pressed into hers , and not only her resistancebut her very flesh seemed to dissolve . After ap221single shuddering beat , her heart quivered into a stillness that was more terrifying than violence . " Everything has stopped , " she thought desperately . " I ca n't see . I ca n't even see . " Then , as she reached out and caught hold of the bench for support , she heard an inner voice saying triumphantly over the dark waves in her mind , " I never knew kissing was like this . I never knew anything was like this . " Drawing away , he said carelessly , in a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in . You 're a nice little girl ; but you must remember you 're only a little girl . This is n't the first time I 've kissed you . " Yes , it was true , he had kissed her before , but never like this . Oh , never , never like this . If only she might stay here , within the safe shelter of the ivy , and sink down on the bench until the vehemence had subsided . She felt suddenly limp , boneless ; her will had oozed out of her . " We 'd better go back . Your grandfather may be waiting , " he added hurriedly , and she saw that he was impatient to return to the hospital . Perhaps it was only the fading light that made him appear different . Could he have forgotten so soon ? How soon did men forget after they kissed you ? He seemed so eager now that she could barely keep up with him . As they started back , she saw his cigar still smoking on the ground where he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of irrelevance , " Oh , is n't everything wonderful ! Is n't it lovely to be alive ! " The glow in her senses still lingered , as if it were a part of the flushed evening air ; but with every step away from the summerhouse , this quivering harmony , without and within her mind , melted into the twilight . " I 'm sorry to hurry you , " he said when they reached the porch . Where , she wondered , had this happened before ? " But they expect me to go up as soon as your grandfathercomes down . I 'm afraid he 's waiting . " " No , there he is now . William has found him , " she repliedin a tone she tried in vain to make as casual as his . Indignantly , she thought , " I hate him . Never , never could I really like a fair man , and one who is old too . " Yet , while these words were still in her mind , she felt a throbbingsoreness far beneath the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just out of the shell , and she felt that this somethinganger , jealousy , desire , disappointmentwould outlast any effort of will , any fiercely uttered resolve . " After all , it was n't my fault , " she told herself passionately . " I did n't mean anything . I did n't mean anything in the world . " " Yes , there he is , " George said quickly , and his voice , she realized , was suave with relief . " Have you just come down , General ? We were watching for you . " Stroking William 's head , General Archbald blinked in a dazed way , as if he had heard only half of the question . Never , his eyes said , as he held out his hand , had he known before what it felt to be old , to be finished , with life still unappeased in his heart . " I stayed longer than I expected to , " he repliedP223wearily , " but I did not know . She seemed to like having me . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been looking forward to your visit . There were things she wished to talk over with you . " " Yes , I thought talking might do her good . John Welch came as I was leaving . " " I said I 'd meet him . How are you going home ? Is your car there ? " Youth had dropped from George as quickly as it had revived in the summer-house . Lines of fatigue and that strange look of injured resentment hardened his features . " No , Isabella said she would stop for me . She is probablywaiting . " " Let me go out and look for her . If she is n't there , I 'll ' drive you home before I go up to Eva . It wo n't take but a minute . " The General shook his head a trifle impatiently . It was kind of George to be solicitous ; but solicitude in younger men was one of the favours he preferred to reserve for the last . " Do n't worry , George , " he said , knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Though William and I are not so spry as we once were , we are not yet decrepit . " " Of course you 're not , " George agreed ; and for the first time since they had entered the hospital , he glanced at Jenny Blair with a smile . " Well , then , since there 's nothing I can do for you , I 'll go up to Eva . This is a nice little girl , General , " he added , patting her shoulder . " It 's hard to realize she 's grown up , is n't it ? " Without waiting for an answer , he turned away , while Jenny Blair stared through the front door at the row of empty cars by the pavement . " I hope I did n't keep you too long , my child . " " No , I did n't mind . There was a lovely sunset . " " I know . Mrs. Birdsong 's room faced that way . It is hard to watch her suffer . The hardest thing in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is she suffering now , Grandfather ? " Jenny Blair asked in a despondent tone . Mrs. Birdsong , who had been as vague as light in the summer-house , had suddenly become as vital as pain within the walls of the hospital . " They have quieted her nerves , and she is so gallantso gallant . . . . But I must n't depress you , my dear . If your mother and I had our way , we would keep all knowledgeof suffering out of your life . There is time enough to be sad . Time enough , Heaven knows , when one is old . " Jenny Blair sighed . " I am not sure , Grandfather , that I wish to go away . I mean to go away and study for the stage . " " Bless your heart , my darling , I knew you 'd feel that way . I knew you did n't really wish to leave us . " As he enfolded her with his protecting arm , which trembled a little , his voice quivered with the unavailing tenderness he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabella and the two older children in the big open car which Joseph Crocker was driving . Handsome , robust , warm-hearted , Isabella was happily married to a man who combined the evangelical virtues with the untroubled face of a pagan . After a restless youth , she had settled into marriage as comfortably , Mrs. Archbald had once remarked , as a blanc-mange rabbitsettles in a bowl of jelly . Though a trifle heavy in figure , she was nimble in mind and vivacious in conversation , a little too wide for the sheath skirt which was just going out , and not quite broad enough for the modern ideas which were just coming in . " Sit by me , Father , " she said , making way for him . " I wo n't let the children bother you , and there 's plenty of room for William between us . Be quiet , Erminia , I ca n't hear what your grandfather is saying . " Joseph , at the wheel , was silent , expert , and amiable . Fortunately ( and this was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost as limited as his religion . While she nestled as far down as she could beside the children , Jenny Blair felt rather than heard the monotonousripple of words punctuated with laughter . In the west , as she looked back , there was a shadowy green afterglow , like the thin branches of trees . The wind blew the scent of buds in her face ; and it seemed to her that the twilight was whispering in her ears and playing slowly over her flesh . Gradually , while the car sped down the street , the soreness in her heart melted away , and she recoveredthe sensation of surprise and delight she had lost in the hospital . The farther she passed from experience , the more real her happiness was in her thoughts . " It is all my own , " she said over and over , with the feeling that she was swept onward by some dark current of life . " I have something precious to think of that belongs only to me . " It was strange ; it was new ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , in some secret way , she felt that she had always expected it , that all the years she had lived began and ended with that kiss in the summer-house . Not with her mind . She had never really known with her mind that a lover could kiss like that ; but her heart had been prepared , though her mind had never suspected . " It is all my own , and it wo n't hurt anybody , " she thought . " This is enough . I do n't ask anything else . Nobody need ever know . Even he need never know that I think of him . If only I may see him for a single minute every day , I shall be perfectly happy . " And it seemed to her , lying back in the car , with the April wind in her face and shivers of delight playing over her body , that a hopelesspassion was far more romantic than the happy endp227of all the fiction she was permitted to read . With a wave of exultation , she remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervening roofs to the Birdsongs ' house . She might stand at her window , with nobody suspecting why she was there , and watch him cross the pavement and open the front gate , or even , if she went to the back window and leaned very far out , she might catch a glimpse of him in the garden where Old Mortality used to live in the lily-pond . Suddenly , as if by a miracle , the world was glistening with joy . Was the car stopping already ? Why , they had started only a minute ago . In a dream , she followed her grandfatherand William out on the pavement ; in a dream , she called " Good-night ! " to Joseph and Aunt Isabella ; and in a dream , she clung fast to her grandfather 's arm while they went up the steps and into the house . From the library , she heard her mother 's anxious voice , " I hope Eva is not worse . You were so late , I was getting un-easy . " A wood fire had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather and English calf borrowed a fine glow from the flames . Under their feet , the immense floral designs in the Brussels carpet blossomed out like a garden ; and William flung himself down , with a happy sigh , on a field of roses and pheasants . For forty years , General Archbaldhad tried in vain to keep the library for his own use ; but there had always been the dread that a closed door might hurt somebody 's feelings . Now , Mrs. Archbald 's work-bag of flowered silk lay on his desk , with the con- tents of bright scraps and spools scattered over his blotting-pad . The evening paper , read but neatly folded again , was waiting under the lamp on a table beside his favourite chair . " No , she 's as well as I expected , " the old man answered . " But it was a shock to me to see her . It was a shock , Cora . " " Come and lie down on your sofa , Father . I 'll cover you up , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better let me bring you a sip of brandy , " she added , while he lay down obediently on the soft old sofa , and she drew the blanket of ruby wool over him . " I never saw you look as if you needed it more . " " Yes , I need something , " the General assented , watching her as she moved about in the cheerful glow , patting the cushions , arranging the chairs , putting out a lamp or two , and finally placing a fresh log on the andirons . " I am a very old man , Cora , but I only found it out this afternoon . " " Nonsense , Father . The idea of your talking like that . After all , you 're only eighty-three . Why , to look at you , any one would think that you were still in the prime of life . " Usually her flattery succeeded ; but to-night , after that trying excursion into the past and the still more trying visit to the hospital , he felt that he required a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a slight frown ( strange how everything seemed to exasperate him ! ) , " Is William there ? I did not see him come in . "   " Yes , he is here by the fire . He came in with you . " " He is old too , Cora . " " You may keep him a good while yet . Rufus lived to be sixteen . " With a last comforting pat , Mrs. Archbald murmured , " Shut your eyes tight , " in the soothing tone she used to Isabella 's baby , and tripped through the hall and out into the garden . Returning a moment later with a few fresh and very young sprigs of mint , she found Jenny Blair looking for her in the pantry . " Mamma , I want to ask you something . " " Well , you must wait , dear , until I make your grandfathera mint julep . The strain has been too much for him . He ought not to have stayed so long . Clayton , bring me the brandy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I only want to ask you if I may give away the kimono you gave me at Easter . I feel so sorry for Mrs. Birdsong . All the afternoon I 've been wondering what I could do for her . My light blue kimono with purple wistaria would be so becoming to her , and I 've never worn it . " " That 's very sweet of you , but do n't you need it yourself ? I gave it to you because your old one looks faded from so much cleaning . Wait now , while I pour out this brandy . Your grandfather likes just a thimbleful . " With tightly pursed lips and the utmost precision , Mrs. Archbaldmeasured the brandy into the silver goblet . Then relaxing slightly , she reached for the ice , and after filling the goblet to the brim , decorated the top with her sprigs of young mint . Immediately , a pattern of frost was woven at the touch of air on the silver .   " Then you wo n't mind , Mamma ? I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , you can always give me an-other . " Mrs. Archbald laughed happily . " Why , I sha n't mind in the least , darling . I think it is sweet of you , and the blue and purple will look lovely on Eva . Now , do n't stop me . Your grandfather is waiting . " The General was dozing when she entered ; but he started up at her touch , and held out his trembling hand for the goblet . " I hope it is just right , Father , " she said in her sprightliest tone . " You looked so tired that I made it a little stronger . It wo n't do you a bit of harm . I do n't care what anybody tells you . " " Yes , it is just right , my dear . I felt a sudden weakness in the hospital . If only my legs would n't give way . " Picking up her work , Mrs. Archbald sat down between the lamp and the sofa , and waited patiently for the invigoratingeffect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived genuine pleasure from the drinkingand smoking of others , especially if they were men ; and she was fond of saying that the whiff of mint always made her feel better . The nearest she had come , however , to the flavour of brandy , was when she played occasionallywith the crushed ice that was left in a goblet . " I was so touched by Jenny Blair , Father , " she said presently . " The child has been trying to think of something she could do for Eva ; and she asked me just now in the pantry if I 'd mind her parting with the blue and purple kimono I gave her Easter . She wishes to take it to Eva . "  | " I 'm glad of that . I was beginning to think she was less sympathetic than I liked her to be . " " Oh , it is n't that . She has a great deal of feeling . Only in some ways she takes after me , and the deeper her feeling , the less able she is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the old man repeated , and indeed he was . Even in his weakness , he had been visited by a vague apprehension while he waited those few minutes for Jenny Blair to come to him from the yard of the hospital . An impression , nothing more , he told himself now with relief , and in that queer faintness , that giving way of his legs , impressions were apt to be less accurate than usual . " I am glad , too , that she has given up her wild idea about going to New York and studying for the stage . " " Why , I did n't know that . " Mrs. Archbald glanced round in astonishment . " She told me only last night that she was more than ever determined to go . " " I suppose she has changed her mind . They are always changing their minds at her age . " His voice had grown stronger , Mrs. Archbald noticed with satisfaction , while she put down her work and reached out her hand for the goblet . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spoon and put a scrap of ice flavoured with sugar and brandy into her mouth . " I thought Isabella was , coming in with you , " she said presently , sucking the ice with enjoyment . " This is her cook 's afternoon off . "  | " She said something about the baby . I did n't pay much attention . " Mrs. Archbald edged her chair nearer the sofa . " Do n't you remember my telling you , Father , that I believed the Crockers were more quiet than plain ? I always thought there must be good blood somewhere . " " I remember , my dear . You thought there was good blood in Joseph 's nose . " " Well , I was right . There is . " Mrs. Archbald was sprightly , for she could see a joke , but firm also , for she was defying a precedent . " I 've had several genealogists look up Joseph 's family . Those experts charge a great deal , but it is wonderful what they are able to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out this time ? " " For one thing , " her tone was impressive , " the first Joseph Crocker came over in 1635 and settled in James City County . He must have been Joseph 's earliest Americanancestor . It is n't likely there should have been two Crockers of that name , and it is more than probable that Joseph 's family was a branch of the real Crockers . " " As real as any , I imagine , but what did the first Joseph do after he came ? " " We 've nothing yet but the name . That is most important , and it seems better to go slowly about everything else . Of course the family must have had many reverses , and I imagine they were always quiet people , and very devout . More like Puritans than Cavaliers . Not that itp233really matters . It does seem funny , " she added brightly , " that the less religion people have , the more they seem to desire it in their ancestors . It is so distinguished , I suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph . But even allowing for the gap where the county records were lost or burned in the war , the descent is all perfectly clear . Then an English genealogist wrote me that he had traced Joseph 's descent , through the distaff side , from one of the barons of Runnernede . It is all very interesting ; but I am not sure that the information is worth as much as he asks . We never bothered about our family tree , did we ? " " Only to lop off decayed branches . It might , however , be worth more if Joseph is able to convince Isabella that she married above her . " " Oh , I have n't told Isabella ! She would only make fun of it and ask me to spend the money on little Erminia 's teeth . But I 'm doing it all for Erminia . Isabella is so lacking in class feeling that Erminia is sure to have too much of it . When she grows up she may want to join the Daughters of the Barons of Runnemede ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " " Yes , I 've noticed it in other matters , particularly in the profession of law . " " It is strange , though , about families , " Mrs. Archbald observed , as she rose and swept up the spools and scraps from the desk . " I mean the way they go down and come up again . Every one thinks the Crockers ' family history has been most extraordinary . " Small , bright-eyed , very erect , she stood with her work-bag in her arms waiting to help him to his feet . " After all , we 're stronger than I thought , Cora . I feared that noblesse oblige had been exhausted by BrevertonGoddard . It is still true , however , that the only real test of importance is to fly in the face of it . " " I know you think it ridiculous , Father , but there islittle Erminia The old man smiled at her perplexity . He knew her mind as well as she knew it herself , perhaps better , and he had often wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for truth . There was n't a kinder person on earth ; but if she ever spoke the truth , it was by accident , or on one of those rare occasions when truth is more pleasant than fiction . Not that he distrusted her now . Her documents were in order , no doubt , and the deception in this particular instance resided , he suspected , in record or even in genealogy . No , it was the way her higher nature lent itself to deceit that amused his intelligencewhile it exasperated his conscience . Had it been her lower nature , he thought whimsically , one might become more easily reconciled . But because she was charitableand benign , her dissembling became , in some incredible fashion , the servant of goodness . How much innocent pleasure had she conferred , how much painful embarrassment had she relieved ! Even when she had stood between him and happiness , he had never doubted that she was ruining his old age from the noblest motives . P235Yet what is goodness , he asked himself , with a flash of penetration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If it exists at all , pure goodness must be superior to truth , superior even to chastity . It must be not a cardinal but an ultimate virtue . Rising very slowly , as if his joints were brittle , he balanced his weight without taking the hand Mrs. Archbaldstretched toward him . From the centre of the floral design , William looked up and thumped his tail three times on the carpet . He also had grown stiff in the joints , and he realized that , since the dinner hour was approaching , the separation would be only a brief one . " Shall I call Robert ? " Mrs. Archbald asked , and her tone was full of solicitude . " No , I can manage the stairs by myself . He is probably waiting for me . All I need to make me young again , my dear , as I 've told you so often before , is a new pair of legs . " He crossed the room , and holding firmly to the back of a Queen Anne chair , looked round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or did his slowness mean that he was too tired to walk upstairs by himself ? " Father , " her voice was cheerful but pleading , " wo n't you let me call Robert ? " " No , my dear , there is nothing the matter . Only , " his brow wrinkled in annoyance , " I remembered that I 'd forgotten to ask after Etta . " " She had a bad morning , poor thing , but the doctor gave her codeine , and that relieved the pain in her head . I told Clayton to take her dinner up a little early . She so often feels better after she eats something . Doctor Pembrokethinks her headaches come from sinus trouble , and he is treating her every day . " " I ' 11 stop to speak to her as I go by . " " Would n't you rather wait till after dinner ? You will feel stronger then . " " Well , I 'll see . I 'll see . " Yes , she was rightshe was usually righthe needed the unfailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braced , he would feel replenishedin courage . As he reached the head of the stairs , Jenny Blair , in a new dress of rose-coloured chiffon , ran out of her room . " Are n't you coming down , Grandfather ? I thought I was late . " " In a minute , my dear . Run ahead . " " I wish our house had a place downstairs where you could wash your hands and brush your hair . The Peytonshave one . " " Well , I do n't envy them . I like where I 've lived and the ways I 'm used to . I do n't mind the stairs , but I miss the feeling of my old velvet jacket . " And he thought , as he watched her flitting down the stairs , " The child grows prettier every day . That rose-coloured frock gives her the glow she needs . " Soft , starry-eyed , with a centre of inscrutable mystery , she slipped away from him , while he said to himself , " The poets are right . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Etta 's half-open door , he saw that she had pushed aside her dinner-tray , and was readingp237a book with a yellow cover by the light on the candlestand . " Do n't you find that reading makes your head worse , my child ? " he asked , pausing a moment . Etta , who had been lost to the world in the French language , thrust her book under the bedclothes and turned a dejected face on her father . Dangerous reading had been her only vice ever since the days when she had hidden under the bed to enjoy in secret a borrowed copy of Moths ; but even Ouida had begun to seem staleor was it immatur  --  in the twentieth century . While he gazed down on his invalid daughter , the old man wished , and reproached himself for the wish , that Etta had been born with a littlea very little would sufficeof Isabella 's attraction . If only sympathy were softened by the faintest shadow of luxury ! There was nothing , he told himself , that he would not do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort . In one way , at least , she was closer to him , she was dearer than Isabella , or even than Jenny Blair ; but it was a way that made him long to look somewhere else , that depressed him unbearably . Just as Isabella 's defiance appeased some secret revolt , some thwarted and twisted instinct for happiness , so Etta revived in the flesh another and a defeated side of his nature . She embodied all those harsh and thorny realities from which he had tried in vain to escape . He had closed the door on ineffectual pity , and she had opened it wide . He had hardened himself against desire that is impotent , and she wore the living shape of it whenever he looked at her . Now , as he bent over and stroked her head , he felt for a moment that she gazed up at him with the incredible eyes of his own disappointment . " Is n't it bad for you to read so steadily , my child ? " he asked again , because he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to do something , Father . I ca n't just lie here and think . " Her long sallow face , with its opaque expressionand imperfect teeth , was like a waxen mask which concealed every change of thought , every wandering gleam of intelligence . The jagged streaks from a mentholpencil had left a yellow stain on her forehead , and she had pushed back her pale brown hair until it hung in a straight veil to her shoulders . Some women , he reflected , appear to advantage in bed ; but poor Etta was not one of these fortunate creatures . In all her clothes , after the temporary repairs achieved by Mrs. Archbald , she was sufficiently attractive for a woman who put no strain upon the fragile emotions of men . But prostrate from a severe headache , and too ill to submit to the simplestimprovements , she was scarcely more appealing than some heartless caricature of feminine charms . Poor girl , poor girl , if only one were not so helpless against illness ! For she was the victim of life itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any system invented by man . No system could help her , not all the rights of suffrage piled on one another could improve a mortal lot that had been defeated before it came into the world.  |p239It  might be possibleit was always possible , of course , to blame heredity ; but Isabella , with the same inheritance , he reminded himself , was strong , handsome , magnetic , with a hearty relish for life . Had there been some secret flaw in his own nature , or in Erminia 's open and innocent soul ? We know so little of inheritance , he thought , we know so little of anything . Perhaps when we learn more . . . Perhaps , poor girl , he sighed , and turned away from the old spectre of impotent pity . . . Before Jenny Blair undressed that night , after she had put her lessons away , she took out the Japanese kimono and unfolded it on the bed . How exactly like a spring afternoon , she thought , with the blue sky shining through trailing clusters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue paper and tied the package with blue ribbon , she thought with a rush of pleasure , " It is the prettiest thing I have , but I wish it were more beautiful still . I 'd give her anything in the world I have if it could do her the least bit of good . If Mamma would let me , I 'd give her my pearl and diamond pin . " She longed to sacrifice herself for Mrs. Birdsong ; she pitied her from the depths of her heart . " I could n't bear to hurt her , " she thought , " but how can it hurt her for me to feel this way in secret ? Even he will never , never suspect that I care . " Vaguely , she repeated , " I do n't mean anything . I do n't ask anything for myself . If only I may see him from a distance , even if we never speak a word , I shall be perfectly happy . " This was all that she asked . And yet , though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was already tormented by the longing to be with him again to be with him again just for a moment ! But the torment was less of pain than of a joy too intense for the memory to hold . After she had opened the window , she tried to see beyond the intervening houses into the Birdsongs ' garden ; but there was nothing more than a pattern of darkness and moonlight under the moving branches of the old mulberry tree . Slipping out of her clothes at last , she tossed them in a heap on a chair and stretched her body , in its batiste nightgown , between the cool linen sheets , which were scented with lavender . Mamma had promised to let her wear nightgowns of pink crepe de chine when she had her coming-out party ; but cambric or batiste was considered more suitable for children and very young girls . " Now I have something to think of , " she whispered , as she clasped her hands on her bosom and gazed straight over the foot of the bed at the glimmer of moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let myself really remember . " Immediately , as if the phrase were some magic formula , she discovered that all she had to do was to let herself sink back into the luminous tide which ebbed and flowed through her mind . Not by thinkingbut by feeling , by lying very straight and still and feeling with all her heart and flesh , she was able to live over again the startled wonder and the burning rapturep241of love . " I never knew it was like this , " she said under her breath . " I never dreamed life was so wonderful . " And with the flowing tide of sensation , her pulses sang again in her ears , and the grasses and clover raced ahead of her into the future . Was +iappiness outside , at the end of the race ? Was happiness roaming beyond the room and the house and the garden , through the darkness of the world and the universe ? All night , in a pause between waking and sleeping , she fled in circles through a dark forest , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking of boughs and the crackling of dead leaves as he followed her . All night she ran on and on ; yet no matter how far and how fast she sped , always she came again to the place from which she had started . Round and round in circles , and never escaping.  |p242WHEN  General Archbald came out of the house the next morning , he found his daughter-in-law waiting for him in the car . " I could n't let you go by yourself , Father . It will be a great strain on you , and besides , " she added , with the anxious sweetness that never failed , he reflected , to stroke him against the grain , " I want to be there in case Eva should need me . George is so helpless . " " If you feel like that , my dear , you must not let me keep you from going . " " I sha n't be in your way . While George is talking with you alone , I 'll wait outside in the visitors ' room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he glanced up uncertainlyat the promise of rain in the sky . " There is no reason he should talk to me alone . I can imagine nothingthat has n't already been said . If we drive fast , we may get there ahead of the shower . " " Yes , I told Baxter . But one never knows about George . He has so little command over himself when he is really moved . I never saw any one give way so completely , though he tries hard to keep up when he is with Eva . " P243The General frowned . " That means , I suppose , that he will unburden himself to me . I do n't want it , " he said testily , " I wo n't have it . You 'd better stay with him , Cora . You have more patience with people than I have . " " But did n't you promise Eva ? That was one of the things she wanted to ask you . " Yes , he had promised . 1le had promised , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of George put him into an ill humour . Ever since last evening , ever since he had had those abrupt words with John Welch in the hospital , he had preferred not to see George . He liked him ; he did justice to his good intentions ; but he wanted to keep out of his way , at least until the morning was over . Of course it could n't be done . He had given his promise to Eva . George was probably waiting for him at this minute . " I suppose , " he said aloud , and Mrs. Archbald jumped at the grim sound of his voice , " fortitude will be the last thing to go . " " You are so wonderful , Father , " she replied , and he realized , with an inward chuckle , that her artificial resourceshad failed . An admirable woman , he mused , looking at her profilein the oblique light from the window , admirable and unscrupulous . Even the sanguine brightness of her smile , which seemed to him as transparent as glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persevering hypocrisy . A livingtriumph of self-discipline , of inward poise , of the confirmed habit of not wanting to be herself , she had found her reward in that quiet command over circum- stances . From her first amiable word , he had known that the excuse on her lips was merely another benign falsehood . Ever since he had complained of the tingling in his limbs , she had determined , he realized , not to let him go out alone . Sitting rigidly beside this small , compact , irresistible force , he felt the hot flush of temper spread in a stinging wave over his features . He was easily nettled nowadays , sometimes by trifles , sometimes by nothing at all ; and whenever his temper was ruffled , that hollow drumming began all over again in his ears , as if the universe buzzed with a question he could not hear clearly . All night ( and it had been a bad night ) he had dreaded the return to the hospital ; but as they went down the long hall upstairs , Eva 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural tones . A minute later , when they entered the room , he saw that she had been placed on a stretcher which the nurses had wheeled away from the bed . They had put on her one of the hospital nightgowns ; he could see the neck of it rising above the grey blanket , which covered her smoothly and was folded back almost under her chin . Her hair was combed away from her forehead , and the two thick braids , tied at the wavingends with blue ribbon , fell over her shoulders and bosom . So she had worn her hair as a child , he remembered , and so had the shining mist escaped from the parting . Her face was very pale ; even the full , soft lips had lost their clear red and were faintly pink as they had been when she was little . It seemed to him , too , thatp245her eyes were the eyes of a child , not of a woman , large , wistful , as changeable as the April sky , and encircled by violet shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any other man , he imagined , surprised her with the animation drained from her face , that he had thought of her spirit as effortless . Not until the last few months had he suspected that the sudden radiance of her smile was less natural than the upward flight of her eyebrows . But , as he looked at her now , a quiver ran through his heart , and he felt , with agitated senses , that he was seeing her stripped naked , that he was helplessly watching a violation . For they were looking at her through the ruin of her pride , and her pride , he understood , with a stab of insight , was closer to her than happiness , was closer to her even than love . " I 've had a good night , " she said cheerfully , " and I am just going up . You must stay with George and try to keep him from worrying . There is n't anything really to worry about . It will all come right . Whatever happens , " she added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For an instant , when he bent over her , she gazed up into his eyes , and he knew , even without the note of weariness in her voice , that she did not wish to come hack alive , that she did not wish to go on . What she feared most was not death , but life with its endless fatigue , its exactingpretense . As George turned to the door , she seemed to give way , to snap somewhere within , and the old man saw that John Welch , whose eyes never left her , leaned down quickly and put his hand on the grey blanket . Then George glanced round again , and an inner miracle happened . A long breath shuddered through her ; her slender body straightened itself on the stretcher , and her look , her voice , her gestures , were charged with a fresh infusion of energy . Radiance streamed from her anew . Iler face was glowing but not with colour ; her eyes were shining but not with warmth . " I am feeling so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded excited yet remote . " Ever since John gave me that last hypodermic , I 've felt as if nothing were the matter . George is suffering more than I am this minute . He ought to be out in the air with a cigar . " Yes , it was true . George was really suffering more than she was at the moment . His handsome florid face had changed utterly since the beginning of her illness . The rounded contour , so youthful a few weeks before , had sagged and hardened , and there were lines of anxiety between nose and mouth and beneath the still boyish grey eyes . " I sha n't smoke so much as a cigarette or touch a drop to drink till you 've come through it , Eva , " he said with obstinate misery . " I told you I would n't , and this time I 'm going to keep my word . " The scene was so painful to General Archbald that he glanced from the stretcher to the bare little room , which was stripped also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it tore away all pretenses . Nothing , he reflected , not even external objects could withstand tragedy . Even if she does n't die , he thought , we shallp247never be the same , for we have gone through the expectationof death . He stared at the sickly green of the walls , at the white iron bed , as hideous , he told himself , as a rack ; at the painted bureau , with drawers that stuck when the nurse tried to open them . The vases of flowers were still outside the door ; but there were violets in a cream-coloured bowl on the window-sill , and their fragranceseemed to him faded and sad . Then , while he still looked away , the stretcher was rolled out into the hall , and turning at last , he found that he was alone with George in the room . " Did Cora go up with her ? " George nodded . " Only to the door . Eva would n't let me go even that far . " " Well , she has John . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fine boy , " the General added , for the sake of hearing himself speak . " He will make a good doctor . " " Yes , he will make a good doctor . " " It was a fortunate day when you took him to live with you . Let me see , he is Eva 's cousin 's child , is n't he ? " " Betty Bolingbroke 's . His father was a rolling-stone , and the poor little chap was knocked about from pillar to post . He always bore a grudge , even as a child . I was sorry when Eva took him in , but I 'm glad now that she did . " " It was a good thing . Yes , it was a very good thing . " Walking back to the window , the old man looked out with dazed eyes on the yard . Rain was falling . The jon/quils were beaten down and spattered with earth . At the end of the asphalt walk , he could see drenched ivy on a summer-house . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no time to listen to him . " We need rain , " he said aloud . " This country needs rain . " He turned to George and their eyes met . Nobody ought to look like that . There was such a thing as proper pride , even in misery . Nobody ought to look stripped to the soul . " Try to brace up , " he said . Somewhere he had heard that phrase before , and it was the only one he could think of that sounded as unnatural as the moment , as unnatural as life . " There are some things I ca n't stand up against , " George replied , smoothing the hair back from his damp forehead . Walking slowly across the room , he dropped into a wicker rocking-chair by the window . " Why , " he asked despairingly the next instant , " should it have to be Eva ? " " Nobody knows . Nobody knows anything . " But silence , the old man felt , was what he wanted . Not complaints , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by torture from brittle emotions . Not words ; above all , not words . " I 've got to talk , " George said defiantly , as if he had read the other 's thoughts . " If I have to stay bottled up , I 'll go out of my mind . " Haggard , limp , lost to all sense of proper reserve , he was not , even in his naked misery , entirely without charm . Something large , simple , primitive , and unashamed , looked out of his pain-streaked facep249and his wide grey eyes , which were darkened by the shadow of injury and defeat . He was not only unhappy , the General realized , but indignant because he was compelled to submit ; and his indignation , even more than his unhappiness , made him appear simple and human . " Are you sure , " General Archbald inquired , " that you would n't be better in the visitors ' room ? " " God , no ! What do you imagine I 'd be doing out there ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not for me . I like people as long as things are easy ; but I take to cover when I begin to break . " " Well , after all , do n't you think you are taking it too hard ? Bridges thinks she has a fine chance " He says that , but he does n't mean it . He talked to me . It 's the worst they can do , the very worst . Even if she comes through , she 'll be an invalid . She 'll never come up again . I know Eva . " His voice flinched and quivered as if it were a living nerve . Yes , it was impossible to doubt that he loved her . Deception was nothing ; infidelitywas nothing ; only that authentic passion endured . " Many women have gone through this , my dear boy , and lived happily . John assured Cora most positively that there is no sign ofthat there is not the slightest sign of an incurable malady . " " Bridges says that , too , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely sure until afterwards . " He raised his head with a jerk and stared out into the rain . " Why , in God 's name , should it have to be Eva ? " A groan burst from him , and he exclaimed in a smothered voice , " I could bear it better if I had measured up ! " The General sighed . He wished Cora would come back . Cora knew the right tone to take , even with grief . " You have measured up , " he answered , after a pause . " You have made her happy . " " No , I have n't made her happy . " " Well , even if you have n't , she is n't aware of it . She has never known that you failed . " " You ca n't tell what she has known . That 's the worst of it now . I could never tell what she was thinking all those monthsall those years . " " She thinks the best of you . She believes in you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nobody knows . If only she had n't smiled all the time . I could bear it better if she would stop smiling . " " That is the habit of a lifetime . Nothing can change it . " It is n't natural . I am always thinking she will smile like that when she is dead . " " Morbid thoughts . You should try to govern your mind . " " I sometimes wish , " George said desperately , " thatshe did n't believe in me . If she saw me as I am , I mightbe able to measure up better . But she would idealize me . She expected too much . I always knew it was hopeless . " " It was n't hopeless . " The old man altered the tenseP251quickly . " It is n't hopeless . So long as she feels that you 've made her happy . " " I tell you she is n't happy , " George rejoined , almost angrily . " She has never been happy . It was all too big for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she feels , what she thinks , what she expectseverything . I am not worth her little finger . Nobody need tell me that . But , after all , you ca n't make a man bigger than he really is . I know I 'm not a big man , and when I come up against anything that is too much for me , beauty , goodness , unhappiness , I give way inside . I ca n't stand but so much of a thing , and then I break up , and that 's all there is of me . When that happens , I am obliged to get out of it . Anywhere . No matter which way . Sport , women , drink . No matter . " It was incredible ; it was distressing ; it was uncivilized . How much better to have smoked a cigar on the porch , or to have taken a brisk walk in the rain . " There is some brandy on the table , " General Archbald said , observing the bottle . " A stiff drink might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stubborn despair . He was determined , the old man realized , to bear his martyrdomto the end , to inflict as many stabs as his tormented mind could endure . " No , I said I would n't drink or smoke , and I wo n't . I 'd give anythingmy soul almostfor a cigarette , but I wo n't even look at one . " How utterly lacking in logic , General Archbald sighed , with annoyance , are human emotions . Night after was true that George had his good points ; but there were occasions when he seemed to wear too thin a veneer of civilization . " Sincere and selfish . His emotion will probablyblow over before Eva is well . " Walking slowly down the hall , beyond the sound of Mrs. Archbald 's comforting voice , the old man came to the sun-room at the back of the hospital . Here the same visitors , or others like them , lounged dejectedly in wicker chairs and turned over the pages of magazines , while they stared now and then through the blurred window-panes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed steadily at nothing , until it seemed to him that the anxious expectancy brimmed over from the faces around him and flowed into his own . A woman in a green hat ; a woman in a black hat ; a woman in a red hat ; a woman wearing no hat at all . In a far corner , a man , young , thin , and poorly clad , was bowed over a florist 's box on his knees , and in his face also there was this look of anxious expectancy . What were they thinking , those human beings , within touch but beyond reach , under that thin wash of reserve ? Each spinning its separate cocoon . Each an ephemeral cluster of cells . Each , perhaps , an eternal centre of consciousness . Each as brittle and fugitive as life itself . The young man in the corner glanced up suddenly , pushed the white pasteboard box to one side , and then pushed it back again where it had been . Turning his head , he looked with fixed , opaque eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a spring , every head in the room turned toward the window and lookedP255out into the rain . " It must be over , " General Archbald thought . " It must be over by now . " Taking out his watch , he glanced at the face of it , pondering , while all the eyes in the room turned slowly and followed his movements . Two hours since they had taken her away . Time to go back . Nothing like that could possibly take two whole hours . Rising from the sofa , he crossed the room slowly and carefully and went to the door . Before he had taken a step into the hall , a needle of burning pain stabbed into his joints , and he thought , with tightened lips , " Why is it always like this ? Why is pain so much sharper , so much more living than joy ? " As he steadied himself with his stick , Mrs. Archbald hurried out of Eva 's room , and slipped to his side . " It is over , Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and he says Doctor Bridges was wonderful . I am so thankful . " He tried to follow her words , to take in all she was telling him . But the pain in his joints was too intense . " Yes , I 'm thankful , I 'm thankful , " he repeated . " If it is over , may we go home now ? " " Yes , we 'd better go home . George is coming with us . I have persuaded him not to stay with her when she comes from under the ether . She asked me not to leave him . " " Then we 'd better go , we 'd better go . " For he had borne all he could bear . This pain was growing worse every minute . " Do we have to wait long ? " " Just a minute . He is to join us in the car as soon as she is brought down . He is n't satisfied to go until he has had a glimpse of her , but after she comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even Georgeespecially George . " To the old man 's astonishment , he found that Cora , who so seldom cried naturally , was crying now as if she enjoyed it . " I ca n't help it , " she said , taking a handkerchief out of her bag and wiping her eyes . " I ca n't help it , " her voice was a sob , " because I have a feeling that she would rather notwould rather not " Yes , he had felt that too . In his heart he was convinced that Eva did not wish to come back . " One has no choice , " he murmured , more to himself than to Cora . " Unfortunately , in such matters , one has no choice . " " I do n't know what they told her ; but she seemed to know that she might , even if she lived through it , be an invalid for a long timefor a very long time . " " Shall we go down now ? " " I told George to come out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she were thinking of something else , " can be very trying . " Then , still thinking of something else , she began to weep afresh , and he realized , with a dull recoil from emotion , that she was putting herself in Eva 's place , and responding with Eva 's temperament , not with her own . " Let 's go , let 's go , " he said urgently . " It will be easier outside in the air . " Clinging to her arm , he hurried her downstairs , into the hall , and through the door of the hospital . As they crossed the pavement , he noticed thatP257the rain had stopped and the heavy clouds in the west were scattered by a spear of sunlight . While they waited for George , the old man huddled down in one corner of the car and counted the red-hot twinges of pain in his joints . One , two , three ; then over again , one , two , three . Eva an invalid , he thought , without feeling the sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world lasted , there would never be another woman like her . Nature had ceased to make queenly women . There was the fiery dart coming back . One , two , three . Would George keep them waiting much longer ? One , two , three . Mrs. Archbald leaned over and patted his hand . " As soon as I am at home , I shall go down on my knees and thank God that she came through it so well . " P258GEORGE left the hospital as if he were running . The skin about his mouth was drawn and sallow , and there were swollen and inflamed puffs under his eyes . " She looks well , " he said . " I had a glimpse as they were taking her into the room , and she looked like a girl asleep . " Then jerking off his hat and running his hand through his hair , he added desperately , " I 've come to the end . Of course I 'm going back a little later , but I must have a smoke and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Archbald inquired . " The nurse told me you were at the hospital nearly all night . It is much better for Eva not to try to see her until she feels better . " " Yes , I know . " He caught eagerly at the suggestion . " She wo n't have anybody with her when she is sick . As if a thing like that made any difference to me . " " Well , it 's better to humour her . Will you come in and let me make you a julep ? " Though Mrs. Archbald disapproved of a julep in the early hours of the day , she realized , being a broad-minded woman , that there are exceptions to every rule of right living . " I am sureP259Father needs a thimbleful , but he never touches a drop until after sunset . " " Thank you , I 'd better go straight home . I 'm not fit company just now for anybody , and I know you both need a rest . I shall never forget how you stood by us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General saw that he was at last empty of words . In the recoil from overstrained emotion , all that mattered was a brief escape from too intense a reality . When the car reached his gate , he muttered , " I shall never cease to be grateful , " as automatically as if the words were spoken by a machine . A moment later he jumped out of the car , entered the gate without glancing back , and went rapidly up the path to the small grey porch , where the wistaria was just beginning to bloom . " It is a pity , " Mrs. Archbald sighed , as they drove on to the red brick house , set well within a black iron fence , at the other end of the block , " that strong emotions have so little staying power . " " If strong emotions had staying power , my dear , none of us could survive them . " Again Mrs. Archbald sighed and considered . " I sometimeswonder if two persons who love each other so deeply can ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly , the great lovers of history are not often the happy lovers . " As the car stopped , and Jenny Blair waved to them from the window , her mother remarked uneasily , " Well , after to-day , I shall never doubt his devotion . PerhapsP260they might have been happier if she had been less jealous by nature . " " Or he more faithful . . . . " Baxter had opened the door of the car , and while the old man stepped cautiously to the pavement , he tried to remember that Eva had her faults as a wife , that she was exacting in little ways , as close as the bark on a tree ( so Cora had said ) , and jealousof every look George turned on a woman . But it was in vain that he forced himself to dwell on her failings . A great love , he thought , is always exacting ; it was for George 's sake that she had learned to be penny wise ; and every chaste woman , according to the code of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recitedher imperfections by name , he found that they scattered like specks of dust before the memory of her face above the grey blanket on the stretcher , with her two childish plaits brought forward over her bosom . He stumbled slightly , and Baxter caught him under the arm and helped him into the house . Why did old men ( women were different ) dislike so much to be helped ? In other civilizations , where manners were more gracious , old age was regarded as an honourable condition . But in America , even in the South , the cult of the immature had prevailed over the order of merit . " Is there anything I can get for you , Father ? " Mrs. Archbald persisted . " Would you like a dose of aromatic ammonia ? " " No , my dear , nothing whatever . All I ask is to lie down for an hour . "  | " You must go into the library . I 'll shut the doors and keep every one out . Nobody shall disturb you till lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blair and Isabella asked together . " Wonderfully . She stood it wonderfully , " Mrs. Archbaldreplied . " Of course she is gravely ill , and she will be sick from the ether ; but John said they felt very hope-ful . " " Oh , Mamma , I am so glad , " Jenny Blair cried happily . " When do you think I may send her my kimono ? " " Not yet , darling . Not for a week at least . She is too ill to enjoy it . Now , your grandfather wants to rest . All this has been a great strain on him . He must be left perfectlyquiet in the library . " While she spoke she was gently pushing them away and leading her father-in-law to the deep repose of his sofa . After she had placed him comfortably and had tucked the softest pillows under his head , she stood looking down on him with anxious concern . " Is n't there something else I can do , Father ? " The old man struggled up . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into my old slippers . " For the pain had returned in his joints , and he felt that no torture could exceed the red-hot twinges of gout . " Jenny Blair will bring them , Father . You must n't get up . Jenny Blair , find your grandfather 's old slippers in his closet . If you do n't know them , ask Robert . " Kneeling on the floor , Mrs. Archbald unlaced the old man 's shoes and drew them off gently . " Is that better ?   Put your feet up . No , do n't worry . Not a soul is coming into the room . " He breathed a long sigh of relief . " It 's the right foot . I could stand the left , but the right foot is too much . " " I know . " She stood up with the shoes in her hand and gave them to Robert when he brought the well-worn slippers . " Would n't you be more comfortable if you loosened your collar ? " He shook his head stubbornly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was commendableto rebel in one 's mind , it was imperative , he felt , to keep on one 's collar . " No , my dear , no . As soon as I 've rested , I 'll go upstairs and brush up a bit . " When he had glanced at the staircase , the flight had seemed to him endless . " I could n't have made it , " he murmured to himself . " Not with this pain . I could n't have made it . " " Remember Etta and I are on the back porch , " Isabellawas saying while Mrs. Archbald closed the green shutters of the French window . " The sun has come out and the air feels like summer . If you need anything , call me . The children have gone to play in the park , and I am going to make Cora lie down until lunch . " But Mrs. Archbald could not rest in peace until she knew that her father-in-law had been properly restored to himself . After leaving him for a minute , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he ate and drank to oblige her , while she watched him with a solicitudethat failed now to annoy him . " You are a staff to lean on , Cora , " he said , humbly grateful .   " Are n't you feeling better ? " " Yes , my dear , I 'm feeling better . " " Are you sure you would n't like Jenny Blair to sit with you ? " " No , I can rest easier by myself . William is here , is n't he ? " " Yes , he is here . " Looking up at the mention of his name , William thumped his tail and moved nearer . " If you need anything , do n't get up to ring . Isabella is just outside the window . " After a last sympathetic pat , she took up the glass and plate from the table , and went out of the room with her springy step . Through the door into the dining-room and the open French window , he could catch a glimpse of the flickering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room , and the familiar objectsappeared suddenly to be swimming beneath the waves of the sea . Outside in the trees birds were calling , and now and then he heard the lowered voices of Etta and Isabella . This was the homely texture of life , he thought presently , woven and interwoven of personalitiesthat crossed without breaking , without bending , withoutlosing their individual threads of existence . A good pattern , no doubt ; but what of those who can not be blended into a design ? He had always been alone ; he had always been different ; yet he had not , except in periods of shock or strain , been unhappy . Unsatisfied , he had been , but not unhappy . Was this because unhap- piness is as rare as happiness ? Was the natural state of mind merely one of blunted sensation , of twilight vision ? For he had had what men call a fortunate life . Only in war had he been hungry and cold . Impoverished , he had been after the war , but not actually famished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he supposed , what all theologians and many philosophers would describe as a moral victory . In other ways , he had prospered . He had had a just measure of those benefits for which revolutions are made , and yet he had not been satisfied . " But my life has been better than most , " he murmured , thankful for the comfort of his slippers , as he sank into a doze . An hour later he awoke with a sense of elation , of extraordinary well-being . " I 've had a good nap , " he thought , with his gaze on the watery green light drifting in through the slats of the shutters . " I feel rested . " Part of his exhilaration may have been only freedom from pain , for the throbbing had died away in his joints ; but there was something more , he told himself , than simple bodily ease . His mind , too , was eased of its burden . " Eva is over the worst , " he mused ; and yet there was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the April wind had blown through his thoughts and scattered living seeds over the bare places . Now and then in the past , especially in his youth at Stillwater , he had known this sensation in sleep , the sudden breaking off of a dream so blissful that the ecstasy had brimmed over into his life . " It is a good world , " he thoughtP265drowsily , while consciousness sifted slowly in flakes of light through his mind . " I should n't wonder if my best years are ahead of me . " Released from wanting , escaped from the tyranny of chance , he might settle down into tranquillity at the end . For age alone , he perceived , strivingto grasp this certainty before it eluded him , is capable of that final peace without victory which turns a conflict of desires into an impersonal spectacle . " Yes , I should n't wonder , " he repeated , " if my best years are ahead . " After another doze , he found himself thinking , " How attractive Jenny Blair looks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl playing that she is grown up . " He saw the heart-shaped oval of her face mirrored in the greenish haze from the shuttersthe rose-leaf skin , the short blunt nose powdered with freckles , the yellow-hazel eyes rimmed so strikingly in black lashes . If one asked nothing more than young innocence ! Then the girl 's face melted into the swimming light . He turned his head on the pillows and thought , with patience born of rest , that he must keep in touch with George for the next few days . He would go over to see him this afternoon . Perhaps Cora had asked him to drop in for lunch or dinner . Some men preferred to he alone ; but George disliked solitude . Well , he would do what he had promised ; he would stand by George until Eva was out of the hospital . And not only because of his promise . For he was fond of George in his heart , though he perceived as plainly as the sternest moralist could have done that George was deficient in character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staying power . In place of character , he harboured a collection of generous instincts . A proof of weakness , no doubt ; yet nothing in General Archbald 's experience had astonished him more than the height that human nature sometimes attains without a solid foundation . A character like granite , he had observed , may prove as unprofitable to virtue as a succession of fine impulses . For it was true that characterbecame warped quite as frequently as impulses ran wild . Yes , it was possible , he found , to admire George 's quality while one disapproved of his conduct . A little later , after lunch perhaps , he would go over for a word with him . A little later , but not now while the birds sang in the trees and the scent of lilacs floated in from the garden . A vague shadow crossed the shutters of the French window , and the still air of the room was stirred by ripples as noiseless as the reflection of leaves in a pond . There was a breathless laugh , broken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird . Jenny Blair , that was her laugh . Had he ever laughed so musically , even when he was young , even before he knew what life is ? What life is at best , with its ceaseless toil , its frustrated desires , and its meagre rewards . When he called that afternoon , George had gone to the hospital , and only John Welch was at home . " I 'm on my way to see her now , " the young man said , turning from the hall into the library , which opened onp267a porch at the back of the house . " Of course she does n't need me . She has Bridges and Adams ; but I feel better if I am within call . " " Then do n't let me keep you . She has stood it well , has n't she ? " " Yes , she has stood it well , though she is too sick now from the ether to feel anything else . If you do n't mind missing George , I 'd like to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't mind missing George . That is the least of my regrets . But I can not keep on my legs . " He sat down in the Windsor chair by the desk , and stared with a fixed frown through the door of the porch . The back yard , which had once been a flower garden , was running wild with unmown grasses and weeds , and several old lilac bushes were in bloom by the steps . It was a pity the garden had been allowed to go to seed ; but the Birdsongswere in straitened circumstances as usual , and they had not been able to afford a gardener since the death of Uncle Abednego . Few old gardens were left in Queenboroughnowadays ; yet he remembered the time when every well-to-do house in Washington Street was enclosed in borders of roses or evergreens . The house , too , looked shabby , he observed , withdrawinghis gaze . Only persons who never read would call the room in which they were sitting a library . True , a few broken sets of books filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of china , mostly of the Willow pattern , were arranged behind the glass doors at the top . Newspapers or light magazines littered the fine Sheraton table in the centre of the room and George 's big mahogany desk by the back window . There were curtains of wine-coloured damask , faded by age and use into a silvery purple , and a grey-green Axminster carpet with rubbed places . In one corner , between the desk and the door , a small cupboard was open , and he could see George 's leather coat and golf-clubs , and , on a rack above , the guns and bags that were used in the shooting season . George was a famous shot . Every year he spent a part of November shooting ducks at a place on James River , and nothing else in life was important enough to interfere with this annual engagement . Since his game-bag was as open as his mind or heart , Mrs. Archbald often remarked that her butcher 's bill was pared down to the bone every autumn . " Is your sciatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he lighted a cigarette . " I had hoped you were rid of that for the summer . " " Worry brings it back , I believe ; but my gout is worse at this minute . I had to come over in my old slippers , " he added ruefully , as he glanced down at his right foot . " I see nothing ahead of me but a diet of bread and water . " Then he asked abruptly , wondering if it could be the absence of Mrs. Birdsong that extinguished the brightness in the room and made even the flowered chintz look wilted , " I suppose you ca n't be sure yet ? " " Not perfectly sure , but the trouble was more serious than they thought it would be . " P269The General winced , " Poor girl , poor girl , she struggledtoo hard not to give up . " For a moment , while he tried to distract his mind , he sat brooding in silence , with his eyes on the blue and white Willow plates on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did women put china in such unsuitable places ? No man would arrange a row of plates on end in a bookcase . Bare shelves would appear better to a masculine eye . " Well , I had my hands fulla : least Cora had her hands full with George , " he burst out at last ; for he was very tired ; his foot pained him ; and the best years of his life , to which he had looked ahead so happily a little while before , were still far out of sight . " I do n't doubt it . " John 's tone was curt . " I sometimes think the whole trouble is too much George . George is not a restful person to live with . Nor , for that matter , is romantic love restful . " " She adores him , and she has always been his ideal , ever since she was a slip of a girl . " " That is a part , the larger part probably , of the trouble . Think what it must have cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years ! You may talk about keeping up socially , but it does n't touch the effort of keeping up emotionally . She must have known , too , in her heart , at least , that George was n't worth it . " " You ca n't deny , after to-day , that he gives her the best that is in him . We ought not to ask more than that of any man . " " Perhaps not . But when the best in a man pulls one way and everything else pulls another way , the only end is catastrophe . " He shook his head impatiently , while the light on his flaming crest and his sharply pointed features gave him the look of a crusader . His face held manliness and sincerity and rugged authority . To be sure , there were persons who distrusted his advanced , or as they insisted radical , opinions . Not only had he become a Socialistin an age when Socialism was still considered dangerous , but he held equally unsound views of suffrage , religion , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in conservative Queenborough were not meant to be flattering . However , names are only words in the end ; and the old man , who had been called by many different names , though never by the right one , in his own youth , could no longer be frightened by labels . Even names with stings in their tails were only stinging words . " My generation felt about social injustice , " he thought . " John 's generation talks about social injustice ; and perhaps , who knows , the next generation , or the generation after the next , may begin to act about social injustice . " Not that it mattered to him now , for that throbbing had begun again in the joint of his toe . " Tell George I came over , " he said , rising heavily to his feet . " I suppose you will find him at the hospital . " " I do n't know . She does n't like to have him about when she is sick . Did you notice how unnatural she became the minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made an effort to seem bright and cheerful . "  | " The strain told every time . I watched her pulse , and finally I asked him to stay out of her room as much as he could . " " Well , it 's hard on him too . After all , he does n't want her to make an effort . HIe 'd much rather she 'd be natural . I believe he is perfectly sincere when he says it does n't make the slightest difference to him how she looks . " " It 's too late now to hammer that into her mind . He fell in love with her , as you say , because she was an ideal , and she has determined to remain his ideal until the end . " " Well , I hope George will keep his nerve , and , I may add , his capacity to feel anything . There is , I suspect , a limit to feeling for every human being . Some are able to stand more than others ; but whenever the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of escape . Well , give her my love , and tell her I 'm ready to come whenever she wants me . " Walking with an effort that exasperated him , he left the house , descended the steps , and made his way slowly past the intervening front yards to the end of the block . At the door jenny Blair met him , and he told himself , startled , that he had never seen her so lovely . " She looks as if she were in love , " he thought shrewdly . " I wonder if she can have a secret fancy for John . You ca n't tell the way a woman feels by anything that she says . " " George was not there , " he said , " but I was talking with John . " He looked at her closely as he spoke , andp272it seemed to him , though his old eyes may have been mistaken , that her gaze faltered . " Oh , were you ? " " She is still suffering a great deal from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they could ex-pect . " " I am so glad . I know she will get well . She has so much to live for . " " Well , I hope she will always have that . Are you going out , my dear ? " " I promised Mrs. Birdsong I 'd go over every day to see her canary . You remember Ariel ? She keeps him upstairsin her bedroom , and she worries about leaving him when she is away . Servants are so careless . Is John there by himself ? " " He is going up to the hospital ; but he said there was no hurry . " " After all , I think I 'd just as well wait till to-morrow . I saw Berry give Ariel his bath and clean his cage this morning . " " Would you rather not see John alone , my dear ? If you feel that way , " he offered gallantly , " I 'll crawl back with you , in spite of my toe . " " Oh , no . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ? But I can see Ariel just as well in the morning . " What did she mean ? he wondered , as he followed her into the hall . Of what was she thinking ? No matter . P273Whatever she thought now , she would probably think something entirely different to-morrow . That night he slept brokenly and was wide awake with the dawn . As the sun rose , he lay motionless in bed and watched the elm branches mounting upward like the inner curve of a wave . Hours must pass before Robert would bring his early coffee , and he knew that he should not be able to drop back to sleep . Rising presently , he slipped into his dressing-gown and went over to the front windowwhich looked down on the street . Though he still occupied the large corner room he had shared with his wife , there were days in summer when he wished for at least a single window that opened on the flower garden . True , there was a plot sown in grass , but too deeply shaded by trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose early , as he had fallen into the habit of doing , he preferred to sit in his wife 's old chair with deep wings in the front corner . Erminia had been dead so long now that he had ceased to associate her with any particular chair . Though he thought of her frequently , and missed her presence more than he had ever enjoyed her company , her figure and even her features had faded graduallyinto a haze of tender regret . Overhead , there was a pale aquamarine tinge in the sky , and long pulsations of light quivered up from the sunrise . On the earth , mist was dissolving ; birds were cheeping ; the rumour of life was awaking , now far off , now nearer , now in the house next door , now in Washington Street . As the light throbbed into his mind ,   he seemed to become , or to have been from the beginning , a part of the dawn , of the earth , of the universe . Girdled about by the security of age , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . For the first time in his life , he might make the most of the spring ; he might enjoy the summer splendour with a mind undividedby longing . His daughters , his daughter-in-law , Jenny Blair , his grandchildren , Williamall these were dearer because they were no longer necessary . And dearer than all , though she , too , had ceased to be necessary , was Eva Birdsong . . . . It was at this moment , while that quiet happiness was filling his thoughts , that his look dropped to the street , and he saw George Birdsong passing along the pavementon the way to his gate . For a single heart-beat , no more , the old man was shocked into wonder . Then , as quickly , astonishment faded . Florid , refreshed , invigoratedby his escape , George glanced with a slightly furtive air at the houses he passed . A few hours later , after a cold shower and a hearty breakfast , he would return with replenished sympathy , no doubt , to Eva 's bedside . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trees , General Archbald sat plunged in meditation from which happiness had strangely departed . The world of good intentions had not altered ; yet , in some inexplicable way , it was different . Virtueor was it merely philosophy ? seemed to have gone out of it . " I wish Robert would come , " he thought . " I 'll feel better again as soon as I 've had my coffee . "  |p275The  sun rose in the heavenly blue ; the birds called in the trees ; and the vague discord of life , swelling suddenlylouder , drifted in from the streets . With inexpressiblerelief , he found that the ripple had passed on , but the deepened sense of security , that tideless calm of being old , had not wavered . At eighty-three , he could still look ahead to the spring and the summer , and beyond the spring and the summer to the happiest years of his life , when nothing , not even life itself , would be necessary.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
