Mayor William Edward Kane of Woburn , Mass. ( pop . 19,700 ) once bought a lion 's cage wherein to parade drunks through the streets . He also peeked through tavern windows , struck from welfare rolls the name of reliefers whom he saw in their cups . <P> Last week abstemious Mayor Kane embellished his repute for quixotic administration . Noting that the moon was full over Woburn , he ordered the local electric plant to switch off the street lights and leave them off on future moonlit nights . When astonished constituents protested , the Mayor explained that : 1 ) he saved the city $70 a night ; 2 ) combined moon and street light was so bright as to blind automobilists . Mindful that the moon is treacherous , he planned to hire two WPAsters as moon watchers . Their job : to call the Boston Edison Co. and order the juice turned on when moonlight fails .
