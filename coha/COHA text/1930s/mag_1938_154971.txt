An interpretation of the Book of Esther , appearing in Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels ' Berlin Der Angriff last week , was of greater interest to diplomats than to Bible students . <P> The Der Angriff version of Esther was labeled The Tale of a King and His Jewish Girl Friend . It told how King Ahasuerus of Persia was lured into marriage by the Jewess Esther , how she persuaded him to banish the Jew-baiting Vizier Haman , and thus saved the Persian Jews from massacre . Adding details not found in the original , Der Angriff related that the King was later murdered and his kingdom , " infected and poisoned by Jews , " finally went to pieces . <P> Just so none of Der Angriff 's readers would miss the contemporary point of this parody-parable , the face of Mme Magda Lupescu , the part-Jewish mistress of Rumania 's King Carol , was used to illustrate the article . And to ram it home , next day the Frankfurter Zeitung 's comment on Carol 's shooting of Rumanian Nazis was concluded with the observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , Rumania will see a revolution , perhaps very soon . " <P> Elsewhere the controlled Nazi press began a campaign which suggested that Rumania had now been definitely nominated as next on Germany 's list of bloodless conquests. * The Essener National-Zeitung announced that the Rumanian Nazi-shooting had been ordered by a Jewish and Masonic camarilla which included friends and relatives of Mme Lupescu . When 2,000 more Nazi-backed Iron Guardsmen were arrested in Rumania , Adolf Hitler and Carol Hohenzollern- who shook hands at Berchtesgaden a few weeks ago- had definitely parted ways . <P> Those Iron Guards who fled from Rumania to Germany found a welcome not unlike that given to the Sudeten " refugees " in September . That Germany would threaten to invade Rumania was improbable , since the two have no common frontier . That Germany might foment a Nazi revolt in Rumania , under the slogan FIGHT AGAINST WORLD JEWRY , had become increasingly probable . <P> <P> * On the grounds that Austria could no longer control its internal disorders , Nazis marched into Austria March 12 , 1938.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
