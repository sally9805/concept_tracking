AFTER THE BRITISH BLUE BOOK CAME THE German White Book , and now we have the French Yellow Book . It can be said with historical accuracy that not one of the Blue , White , Yellow , Red , Orange , and other books published by the various governments during the last war survived the critical examination of scholars . All turned out to have been falsified in one way or another , and the present crop must also be read with care . The most interesting item in the cabled summaries of the Yellow Book is the story of how Hacha was bullied and virtually doped into signing away Czechoslovakia 's freedom . Another illuminating revelation is the statement that as early as December , 1938 , the Allied governments were warned that a Nazi-Soviet rapprochement was a real possibility. , Was it negligence , ' distaste for a Soviet alliance , or Moscow 's terms that were responsible for the failure to heed this warning and arrive at an accord with the U. S. S. R. ? Probably all three . The warning came again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to Hitler how Germany could possibly make an agreement with the fatherland of communism . " You yourself ought to know , " was the cold but realistic answer , " that the most Catholic King did not hesitate in bygone times to make an alliance with the Turks . " TIMING , ANY GOOD BOLSHEVIK WILL TELL you , is the essence of strategy . It is in the light of this dictum that Stalin 's sixtieth birthday must be judged . The fact is that the Soviet press was in a bad way , what with the Red Army staging a Blitzkrieg ohne Blitz , world opinion getting extremely nasty over the " liberation " of the Finns , and Russians in street cars beginning to murmur doubts about the popularity of " the Popular Government of the Finnish Democratic Republic . " Pravda , to cover up the Retreat to Moscow , has been reduced to some Bunyanesque tales of Soviet gunnery , which according to G. E. R. Gedye is a powerful solution of marksmanship and ' ourteenth Street soapbox . When a Russian artillery commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosaic about ' it . " to battle ! " he cries . " At the provocateurs of war ! In the name of the Fatherland ! Fire ! " Or Finland and Panama TN THIS business of safeguarding our neutrality , our ' endeavors to provide general rules are continually meeting shipwreck on the sharp rocks of particular events . The new Neutrality Act , passed after long and anguished debate , was designed to resolve our conflicting emotions in regard to the war between Nazi Germany and the Allies ; that is to say , it was an effort to help the latter as much as possible while simultaneously minimizing the danger of getting into the war ourselves . But hardly was the act in operation when the attack of Russia on Finland produced a new set of circumstances which had not been envisaged at the time the Neutrality Act was before Congress . If on the outbreak of the Russo-Finnish war , both belligerents had been made subject to its provisions , the effect would have been far more harmful to Finland than to Russia . This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily engaged for the victim of Soviet aggression . Hence there was hardly a murmur of protest when the Administration , taking advantage of the technical fact that no war had been declared , just as it has done in the case of the Japanese invasion of China , issued no proclamation under the Neutrality Act but bent all its energies toward rendering physical assistance to Finland . An Import-Export Bank credit has been arranged ; a direct loan making possible the purchase of munitions is being discussed ; the navy has waived its priority on delivery of new bombers . At the same time steps have been taken to place a " moral " embargo on shipments to Russia of armaments , molybdenum , and aviation gasoline . We are far from criticizing these steps , but it is well to realize that they lead in a direction quite contrary to the Neutrality Act . At present the Allies are not at war with Russia , but they are sending Finland what aid they can , and if the war spreads to Scandinavia they may well decide on open intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one . We should then have to drop financial aid to the Finns , insisting on cash and carry , or find ourselves in a very illogical tangle . The westward swing of naval warfare has torn down another of the flimsy fences with which we sought to quarantine ourselves from Europe 's quarrels . The Declaration of Panama , adopted by all the American republics , was intended to establish a neutral safety zone , 300 miles wide , round the entire hemisphere . Belligerent nations were politely requested not to undertake any hostile action against each other in the area so , defined . Britain and France replied that they would observe the declaration provided that Germany observed it or that the United States guaranteed to enforce respect for it . As Germany made no similar statement and we were in no position to give such a guaranty , the declaration became , in effect , a purely pious resolution . Just how pious has been lately illustrated by the fight between the Graf Spec and the British cruisers , and the chasing into a Florida port of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raiders . Now the knotty question of whether we can prevent more such incidents by putting teeth into the Declaration of Panama is being discussed . A first step has been taken by the dispatch of a protest to the German and Allied governments signed by the President of Panama on behalf of the twenty-one republics . The statement served notice that the American nations would consult further in order to strengthen the protection of the " security zone " and indicated that a plan to bar American ports to belligerent vessels which had committed warlike acts within the 300-mile limit was under consideration . But already two South American states have made known their opposition to sanctions of such a nature . And even our own naval authorities may demur at rewriting international law in this way , for it would set a precedent which might prove awkward were this country ever to fight a war at sea . Assuming that these difficulties are overcome , there is still no assurance that the belligerents will respect the Declaration of Panama . Britain has its own bases within the prohibited zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives its enemies an unfair advantage ; thus we shall again be accused of using neutrality as a mask for unneutrality . The truth is that the only way to keep war beyond the 300-mile limit is by the use of naval power . It is doubtful whether the combined American fleets are adequate for such an enormous task ; but if they did attempt it , what would happen when an American patrol discovered a British warship fighting a German warship in the prohibited area ? Would it sail between them and fire impartial broadsides at both ? Under these circumstances we expect the Declaration of Panama to grow teeth slowly , if at all . Meanwhile most of us will pray hopefully for the destruction of the remaining commerce raiders , preferably at a safe distance . This would automatically solve the problem , enabling us to have our neutrality cake and eat it too . Broun 's Requiem T T IS true that we hated to see a former freethinker I buried from a cathedral . Of all the places where Heywood Broun moved , in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he would have felt more out of place than in St. Patrick 's on Fifth Avenue . If we feel impelled to say a few words about his funeral service , it is not to reflect upon the religion he adopted . We do not grudge hun the spiritual solace he found in the church ; but we feel as if it were the duty of some old friend to rise and defend him against the eulogy pronounced at his bier by his spiritual instructor , Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen . Monsignor Sheen is regarded in the church as a scholar and a philosopher . He and Heywood had fought on opposite sides of the verbal barricades on the Spanish issue , but he seems to have come to respect and admire his adversary . The occasion could have been made memorable . That Heywood Broun , the man about town , the radical , should have come finally to the cathedral , recalled a time when the church was truly catholic . But Monsignor Sheen chose to deliver a kind of parish priest 's homily , and used Broun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proselytizing oration . Monsignor Sheen was kind . The kindness was condescending . The very parable he chose for his sermon , that of the worker in the vineyard who received his penny though he did not come until the eleventh hour , seemed to patronize . Only those whose view of religion is scrawny in spirit could fail to see that Broun had served God long before and without benefit of baptism . The love of humanity and devotion to justice which were expressed in his fight for Sacco and Vanzetti were of the kind that has inspired many of the founders and too few of the followers of our great religions . But one felt that in Monsignor Sheen 's spiritual bookkeeping Broun 's life contained no tangible assets until he decided to become a Catholic . The quality of the man did not entirely escape the priest . He was good enough to say that he had never met anyone who gave him " such an understanding of how our blessed Lord must have loved mankind . " And he added that he meant this not merely of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broun , as he first came to him , " in the raw state . " Broun discussed intimate things with Monsignor Sheen  --  his fear of death , his innermost feelings about the church , and what appears to have been a rather abject promise never to write again in favor of birth control . It seemed ill bred for the priest to air them from the pulpit , proudly detailing the story of a gratifying conversion . The best we can say of Monsignor Sheen is that he meant well . But in the midst of the beauties of the high requiem mass , the accretions of centuries of tradition , his words and their rather blundering revelations of intimacies , were painful to hear . E T the old year slide into history . Do not waste tears on it , not even tears of repentance . It is too late for soft consolations . Look back over its days only to find their meaning for the days that are coming . Through understanding we may find strength to meet the new year with hardy pessimism and forswear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of events and our own good sense tell us is likely . Tragedy has overwhelmed the world , and it is in great measure due to a general refusal to brave the facts . The wars that hold millions of men in trenches and hasten the bankruptcy of nations are a tribute to self-deception . No dictator could have brought this horror to pass if men , in high and low places , in all countries , had not permitted fatal steps to be taken toward a showdown they believed could somehoW be dodged . Easy optimism , as well as fear and the drive for power , is responsible for the anarchy that has at last crystallized in war . I can not get out of my mind of paragraph in a book by one of the most experienced Of European observers . M. W. Fodor wrote these words in 1937 at the end of his shrewd study of the intricate conflicts * that led up to the present disaster . Informed persons outside Central Europe , he said , " watch uneasily the news coming from these parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read of some really big disaster in Austria , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , or the Ballcans . But . . . the statesmen of Central Europe keep their blood cool . Dr. von Schuschnigg , despite all his difficulties , refuses to be perturbed . Dr. Benes , the great President of a small republic , has been an optimist for the last four years . The Polish Foreign Minister , Colonel Joseph Beck , declared the other day that people talk about a crisis in Central Europe ; but if a crisis takes the form of permanence , then it is no longer a crisis ; it is a permanent condition of life . . . . " Where are these men now ? Where are their countries two years after those words were written ? Where did they find the fatal optimism that led so surely to political extinction ? The earlier pages of Fodor 's book give no satisfactory clue . But I believe it to be a fact that men in 0 " Plot and Counterplot in Central Europe .
