 | Who Belongs in Prison ? Condensed from Harper 's Magazine Joseph Fulling Fishman and Vee Terrys Perlman Authors of " Crucibles of Crime " and " Sex in Prisons " THE INABILITY Of Americans to perceive the difference between vice and crime is responsible far putting into jails each year thousands of men and women who do not belong there . Not only does this do them no good , but the community gets little protection from their incarceration ; for the victims of certain vices do not offend against other persons or against property . There are thousands of chronic alcoholics sent to jails every year with sentences ranging from five to 6o days . During this time , they live at the expense of the community . Then they are sent out to repeat the process over again . For the most part these prisoners are filthy , indifferent and generally shiftless . Many have physical or emotional defects which make them inebriates in order to escape from the pressure of life . Save in a few instances , it is no more possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet our judges and police officials still seem to feel , after years of repeated failures , that repeated jail sentences will act in some mysterious way as a deterrent . Most of these chronic alchoholics are harmless so far as inflicting damage on the community is concerned . There is no more reason for sending them to prison than there is for sending a person who happens to be sick from any other cause . When a policeman finds a man - or woman-intoxicated it should be his duty to take him home , or to the hospital for treatment . When he is sober he should be discharged . If he gets drunk again it is unfortunate , but it is exactly what he does on leaving jail . There are thousands of vagrants who do no particular harm but who are repeatedly jailed for a few days or weeks . At the end of their terms they are released , promptly go back to their old life , are arrested again , and so on any number of times . Many of them are too old to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to fight for jobs , they lack the ability to stick to anything . Sending them to jail time and time again is not going to remedy mental or emotional defects nor is it going to make old , incapacitated men young . It is only those who are so unstable that they are a menace to themselves or the public who  | should be sent to a custodial institution - not a jail - not to punish them , but merely through ordinary decency . There should be attached to all courts which hear misdemeanor cases competent psychiatrists , physicians and social workers ; and no disposition should be made of any prisoner until these have studied him and his background . Vagrancy is a social , not a criminal problem . For years prostitutes have been thrown into jails . Yet the Women 's Prison Association of New York City , which has dealt with prostitutes for almost go years , in its annual report , 1932 , states : Punishment does not change the woman 's point of view . The prison term is only an interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have been without that punishment . For the woman , prostitution is a problem of opportunity , employment and adjustment to society ; for the community , it is largely a problem of health . Of prostitutes who reach prison , 60 to 85Jo have gonorrhea or syphilis , or both ; and one woman can infect hundreds of men . But any attempt to tackle venereal disease through the arrest of a small percentage of the entire number or prostitutes is hopeless . It leaves the sources of their infection untouched , as well as a tremen- dous number of cases in the community . A program for really eliminating this infection is now possible because the sanitube , invented by a naval physician , has proven efficacious in the prevention of syphilis and gonorrhea ; yet not one man out of a hundred who exposes himself to venereal disease has ever heard of it . There should be an incessant campaign on the part of governmental and civic groups to impress upon men the necessity of protection with these specifics if they have exposed themselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinics to receive free treatment . But it is no more the function of the police to jail a prostitute than it is their function to jail other people who might have infectious diseases . Invariably the woman 's partner in this so-called " crime " is not prosecuted . Women are openly solicited by men , who , if they are diseased , will spread it with just as little regard for others as does the prostitute . Many thousands of men are in prison because they do not have the power to support their families . There is the man who , although a conscientious provider , is unable to obtain work . One would think that no judge would send a working man to prison because of the unemployment situation , yet many of them do . This does not cure the fami-  | ly 's nor the prisoner 's misfortunes , and in jail he is exposed to intimate contact with real criminals . In many cases he puts the knowledge thus gained to use on coming out of prison . Then there is the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incapable of holding a job . Out of so non-support cases taken at random in one jail recently , it was found that 20 could scarcely be expected to become steady workers . One was plainly psychopathic ; one totally blind ; seven of very low mentality ; five were seriously ill . Interference by relatives , selfishness on the part of the wife , or the strain and irritation due to poverty are other causes for nonsupport jail sentences . In every case where a man can not support his family there is a social problem only , and one that is made worse by imprisonment . Once committed , the man usually becomes embittered against his wife , and reconciliation is difficuit . Another group which forms a considerable percentage of prison population are the homosexuals , arrested because they are male prostitutes who cohabit with their own sex . Dr. Harry M. Shulman , who has given considerable time to the history of homosexuals , states that " the possibility of cure for this group is questionable ; that they will be effectively deterred by imprisonment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that in the majority of cases homosexuality is as natural for those afflicted as heterosexuality is for others . Homosexuals who obtain gratification from adults harm no one and do not belong in any institution . Those who contribute to the delinquency of a minor are a potential menace , and if they can not be cured of antisocial tendencies they should be removed from society . They belong in an institution , but not in jail . While the best managed prisons make an effort to keep homosexuals segregated , many do not . Where no such effort is made homosexuals have a fertile field for corrupting others , because their victims have no means of normal sex gratification . In prisons where two men are confined in a cell , whenever a boyish prisoner comes to the institution the warden receives letters from inmates claiming to be a relative of the new arrival and asking to be celled with him . Homosexuals are a threat to the discipline of a prison . Prisoners of the more depraved type carry on flirtations with them , fight over their favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other weapons just as though a woman were concerned . Hundreds of people are sent to  | jail every year for using narcotics . No addict is cured by any method used in prison but in practically every case they return to narcotics shortly after leaving . Even those addicts who have themselves committed to prison to " take the cure " are neither cured nor desire to be . Their aim in almost every case is to reduce the amount of drug they need daily in order to get the same reaction while cutting down the expense . While in prison the addict 's companions , susceptible to anything which will lighten their spirits , may learn to alleviate the monotony of their lives with narcotics . Hence , our incarceration of narcotic users is worse than useless . A large percentage of the inmates of our jails are booked for very trivial offenses , such as fighting , spitting on the sidewalk , putting a slug into a vending machine , gambling , etc . Can anyone seriously contend that these petty lawbreakers are cured or others deterred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain community which jailed z9 , ooo prisoners in one year , over 50-/0 of these had served from two to 65 terms for minor misdemeanors . Aside from its futility , jailing these people imposes an extraor- dinary burden of expense on the community for their continued maintenance . As a more effective and economic way of dealing with this army of petty offenders , punishment should be one of the following according to the judgment of the magistrate . Reprimand from the bench . By fine . If the defendant has not sufficient money , he should be permitted to pay in instalments , even as little as So cents or a dollar if necessary . By sentencing the defendant to spend his nights from about 7.30 p.m. to b a.m. for at least 30 nights , in jail . This will save his job if he has one , take away his free time which every man prizes , and save the community the cost of his food . Instead of gathering in hordes of people subject to personal vices or guilty of petty offenses , the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real felons - racketeers , kidnapers , thieves , swindlers . The failure of existing methods in combating real crime in this country certainly indicates it is high time for us to do away with the rush of trivia which overwhelms our police , prosecuting departments , courts and prisons .
