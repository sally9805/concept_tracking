Directed by Tyrone Guthrie , Laurence Olivier ( The Green Bay Tree ) took the name part opposite Vivien Leigh 's Ophelia . Cadets of the Danish Military Academy acted as soldiers and courtiers . A gale the previous day had left a high sea running and the muffled thunder of waves played a direful counterpoint to the dialog . <P> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Elsinore .
