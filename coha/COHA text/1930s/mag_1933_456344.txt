rifle his father 's desk , or to commit some other unheard-of depredation . Well , the more he objected , the more I urged . No other vessel called at Marutea ; it was the Turia or nothing , and I was determined to go . At last I gained Otto 's reluctant consent . I agreed to take full responsibility , and to explain to his father , if it should be necessary , how I had forced myself aboard the schooner with all my goods and chattels . Otto was of the opinion that we should not be permitted to land . I told him that I was willing to take a chance on that and , if permission were not given , would pay whatever his father asked for passage in the Turia to another island I had in reserve , ? one hundred and fifty miles from Marutea . II At the outset of the voyage I put Herr Midler out of mind ; I would worry about him when the time came . Meanwhile , we had to reach his island in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have pumped half the Pacific through her before we reached Marutea . We had calms and head winds day after day , and once we were hove to in a gale that I thought would founder us . My two cameramen , George Crossland and Karl Zimmerman , thought it a great lark . Fine lads , both of them . As for myself , it seemed to me that we had been born on that vessel ; that we had traveled beyond the limits of the known world . Not a sail , not a smudge of smoke on the horizon ? nothing but empty sea and the tired old schooner , her belly half full of salt water , trudging along in the centre of it , under an empty sky . We got there at last , and from the moment of sighting land all the anxieties and discomforts of the voyage were forgotten . I shall not attempt to give you an idea of the beauty of the place . Words ca n't do it , pictures ca n't do it . Music could , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would understand why I think so . Through my binoculars I saw Herr Miller from afar ; he was standing on the beach near the landing place with a telescope on a tripod before him . He leveled it at us from time to time as we approached , searching the schooner carefully , from stem to stern . Several times the glass was directed at me , long and steadily . I confess that I felt uncomfortable under that long-range scrutiny . An influence decidedly hostile seemed to be making itself felt . A large crowd of natives stood or sat in a circle around him . They made a glorious picture against the background of dazzling white beach , coconut palms , and blue sky . I saw no buildings except a sort of warehouse at one side , near the beach . Even that was beautiful with the shadows of palm fronds moving over its whitewashed walls . One would have said it had been built for that purpose . The schooner was brought into the wind a quarter of a mile offshore and the whaleboat lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not go ashore with us , and he warned me to be careful what I should say to his father . Have you any suggestions as to how to begin ? ' I asked . No ; only let him speak first , Mr. . Forrest . I 'm afraid there 's no hope of his letting you stay . I should n't have brought you ; I really should n't have ! ' Nonsense , Otto ! ' I said , jokingly . He wo n't shoot me , will he ? ' Otto was silent for a moment , as though seriously considering this possibility . No , he would n't do that , but he might strike you with his walking stick . It is an ironwood stick , and he might hurt you badly . It would n't be the first time he has used it . He would be very sorry afterward , but then it would be too late . ' Crossland and Zimmerman came ashore with me . With four native boys at the oars and one at the steering sweep , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the heavy onshore swell made it uglier still . We got across without mishap , but my heart was in my mouth for a few seconds . The boat grounded in the shallows twenty yards or so from the beach , and the sailors started to carry the three of us , pickaback , to dry ground . Herr Muller strode forward and shouted something to them in the native tongue . They dropped us so abruptly that I lost my balance and sat down in two feet of water . Crossland and Zimmerman were as surprised as I was , but they had not fallen and they whooped with joy at my plight . They were the only ones who laughed . The crowd of natives looked on in silence , gazing from Herr Muller to me and back again . He stood with his hands clasped over his cane , which looked more like a war club than a walking stick . He was a magnificent figure of a man , with thick white hair and a snow-white beard reaching nearly to his waist . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never one like this . It was inconceivable to me that he could belong to that fraternity . Race and character were written all over him ; he looked like some old German baron who had strayed out of the feudal system . Vitality radiated from him ? from his beard , from the tips of his strong brown fingers , most of all from his blazing blue eyes . You felt it as you feel the heat of tropical sunlight , and it seemed to come from as inexhaustible a reservoir . He folded his hands across his chest , one hand still grasping the stick , and waited for us to approach . We all have our pride , and I could imagine what a ridiculous figure I presented as I waded , dripping , to the beach . Inwardly , I was boiling with rage , but I took care to conceal it . Remembering Otto 's advice , I waited for his father to speak . He looked from one to another His voice was deep and powerful , and he spoke with only a slight accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , but the fact was that I stood there , tongue-tied , like a small boy caught stealing cookies in his mother 's pantry . Why have you come here ? ' he repeated . The knuckles of his huge fists were white , and I more than half expected him to swing his club without giving me a further chance to reply . He took a quick stride forward , and I needed all my presence of mind to keep from ducking . He did n't offer to strike me , however . With his stick he drew a line in the sand . ' You will go no farther than that from where you stand , ' he said . Then he raised his arms horizontally and glanced back over his shoulder . Two husky young men sprang forward , ducked under his arms , picked him up , and staggered out with him to the whaleboat . A moment later they were across the reef and on their way out to the schooner . III Never in my life before had I been so taken at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people , I felt that I must do something to reassert my manhood , so I walked across Herr Miiller 's boundary line and sat down in the shade at the upper slope of the beach . Crossland and Zimmerman came too . A murmur ran through the crowd at this defiant action , but whether of surprise or approval or apprehension it was impossible to say . Soon the hum of talk became general , but I noticed that the natives kept their voices under , as though they were afraid that Herr Muller might hear them even at that distance . I glanced over the gathering , sick at heart at the thought that we should not , in all probability , be permitted to stay on Marutea . Nature has developed no finer race than the Polynesian . Here was the company for my picture , from the children to the great-grandparents . They had intelligent mobile faces , their teeth were flawless , as white as coconut milk , and their bodies were a delight to the eye . There was not a deformed or sickly-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , and in the imagination I was already at work , the film , Marutea , ' taking shape . The buzz of conversation died away ; the whaleboat was returning . Herr Muller was now at the steering sweep . He had removed his shoes and his white coat , rolled up his trousers to the knee , and was standing with his bare feet braced on the gunwales . In the intervals between the thunder of the surf we could hear him urging the oarsmen on , but , instead of coming to the usual boat passage , he steered to a point where the surf piled up in an awe-inspiring manner . Good Lord ! ' Crossland said . ' Surely he wo n't try crossing there ! ' It looked like a mad attempt , but there was no doubt of Herr Milner 's purpose . Immense coral boulders were scattered there , the wreckage , evidently , of some old hurricane , and the surf piling in among them spouted high in fountains of spray and solid water . All the natives were now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an easy , careless posture , his head turned over his shoulder as he watched the following seas . I wanted to cheer at the noble picture he made . At last , far out , he saw the wave he was waiting for , lifting its back slowly and majestically as it swept in . He shouted his order and the men made their oars crack . Involuntarily I closed my eyes for an instant . When I opened them again the whaleboat was gliding down an appalling slope of surf between two boulders that dwarfed the little craft , and the great volume of water hurled over the reef carried them across the shallows and grounded their boat high up on the sand . Herr Miller sprang out and came toward us in great strides , his arms outstretched , his face beaming . He seized both my hands and shook them warmly . Mr. Forrest ! ' he exclaimed . You are welcome to my island ! Forgive me , my friend ! What a beast I am ! I lose my temper like that ? for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have with you a countryman of mine , nicht wahr ? It is this young man ! ' And he turned to Zimmerman and grasped him by the shoulders . Not since ten years have I met a German ! ' He spoke rapidly and eagerly to Zimmerman , and a moment later turned again to me , laughing delightedly . Do you know what this young man say to me , Mr. Forrest ? He thinks I am a wonderful boat steerer . Never has he seen anyone cross the reef like I do it . No , and you will never see another , my young friend ! Ask these men , born on the island , who live in the sea half the time . Not one of them has the courage , or the strength , or the quick eye , like mine . I am seventy years old , Mr. Forrest , and I am the best man on this island , old or young ! ' Of a sudden his eyes filled with tears . And I treat you like dogs ! But why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I too am an artist , Mr. Forrest . Yes , in this lonely place you find a brother artist . ' ' It is kind of you to call me that , Herr Miller , ' I replied ; but the truth is , I am only a maker of motion pictures . ' Well , that too may be art , ' he replied . ' Never have I seen a motion picture , but I keep in touch with the world . I have my books from Germany , my reviews and illustrated journals . I know a little of what is being done in this new form of art . It is not great , perhaps , like music , but I give it my sympathy , my respect . ' To say that I was relieved is to say little . He was simply charming . I could hardly believe this the same man who had stood , grasping his club , half an hour before . ' Otto has told me , ' he went on . ' You are employed by a German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island life ? ' ' I should like to very much , Herr Muller . Will you let us stay ? ' ' Stay ? Of course you shall stay ! ' he replied , warmly . ' You shall have everything you want . You have only to ask me. ' tv With the natives following , we crossed the island to the lagoon beach where the village lay . The houses were scattered along the curve of the beach for a distance of half a mile on either side of Herr Miiller 's trading station , and before them stretched the great lagoon , as placid as a mountain lake , shimmering in the morning sunlight . The native dwellings were of palm-frond thatch , and stood on clean coral sand that looked as though it were swept every morning ; and so it was , as I found later . Every leaf , every twig , every fallen palm frond , was gathered up daily and burned by Herr Milller 's orders . For all his many years of exile he had not lost his German passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of coral cement , with wide verandahs both upstairs and down . It stood at a distance of fifty yards from the beach , and the intervening space was like the military parade grounds one sees in German provincial towns ? except that it was beautifully shaded with coconut palms , and fine old puke , trees that must have been growing there from heathen times . The store and warerooms occupied most of the lower floor . Upstairs were his living quarters , cool , spacious , high-ceilinged rooms furnished with richly carved and massive beds , wardrobes , tables , chairs , and sofas . On the walls were mirrors in heavy gilded frames , and paintings of German landscapes in the romantic style of fifty years ago . There was even a grand piano . You can imagine our astonishment at finding one on a coral island seven hundred miles from the nearest steamship route . I heard the piano played a few evenings later . It was a strange and memorable experience . We had had dinner with Herr Miller , served in his spacious dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests . Shortly after the meal he excused Crossland and Zimmerman , but it was plain that he wished me to remain . We smoked in silence for a few minutes ; then he said , ' Tell me , Mr. Forrest ; you have recently come from Germany ? ' ' Not six months ago , ' I replied . ' You have been in Hanover , perhaps ? ' And , without waiting for a reply : ' That was my home , and I have not seen it for fifty years ! ' His eyes filled with tears and he leaned his head on his hands , gazing at the table in front of him . Not knowing what to say , I said nothing . I was surprised at this sudden change in mood ; not five minutes earlier his lighthearted laughter had made the walls ring . Presently he raised his head , with such a look of desolation in his eyes that I was deeply touched . ' Forgive me . I cry this way ? like a child . But it is not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his pocket and blew a blast on his nose that must have been heard all over the village , but somehow there was nothing comical in the action . ' I have told you that I am an artist , ' he went on . ' You have wondered about that , perhaps ? You have said to yourself : " An artist ? Was fur ein artist in such a place ? " . . . I keep it locked up ? so long ? so long ? here ! ' He struck his chest a heavy blow . ' Sometimes , Mr. Forrest , I think I go mad ! I am more than forty years in this savage place , and now my life is over . When I think what it might have been .. . And I have been ruined by my own father ! ' He straightened up in his chair and his eyes blazed with anger . ' A beast of a man ! But no . . . what am I saying ? He is dead . Yes , I have forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Listen , my friend . You shall judge . ' V And then he told me his story . I wish that I could tell it as he did ? with his voice , his words , his passionate intensity . He gave me the history of his life . Briefly , these were the facts of it . He was the fourth of eight sons . His father was a wealthy and influential manufacturer of surgical instruments . He had definite plans for all his boys . Four were to go into the army , two into the diplomatic service , and two into his own business . When the fourth son gave promise of having remarkable musical ability , his father encouraged him to develop it . He was supplied with the best teachers that could be found , in both voice and piano , but it was no part of his father 's plan that any of his children should follow a musical career . Music was well enough as an accomplishment , as an amusement for leisure hours , but this son was destined for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Muller had his father 's iron will and passionate nature . Music was the breath of life to him , and he determined to carve out a career for himself . In his eighteenth year came the trial of strength . His father commanded him to return home from Munich , where he was studying , prepared to enter an officers ' training school . Muller refused . His father cut off his funds and the son was compelled to work for his living . No matter . He worked ten hours a day and continued his musical studies at night . In his twenty-first year he was given a place in the Hanover opera company . He joined it secretly , living in lodgings hidden away from his family , and studied and rehearsed his parts without his father knowing that he was in the city . Then came the opening night of the opera season . It was the great event of his life . He had a triumph , he said , and was called repeatedly before the curtain with the principals . His father was present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to direct his own life . The father thought otherwise . Being a man of great influence , he compelled the directors of the company to discharge his son . ' Then , Mr. Forrest , I am like a crazy man . You can not know what this chance to sing means to me . In my dreams I have seen how splendid my future will be . Everyone is astonished at my voice ; and my teachers have all said that I shall be one of the great singers of Germany , perhaps the greatest of my time . When I am told , " You can no longer sing in this company ; your father will not permit it , " I am like a man who has lost everything . If only I could be patient , and work , and say nothing ! Hanover is not the only city in Germany . But no , in my grief , my great madness , I forget everything . Think of it ! I destroy my life to shame my father ! Yes , that is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing no more ! Never ! Never ! I will be like a dog , a homeless dog ! I will throw dirt on the name of Muller ! " ' For three years , so he told me , he held fast to this resolution . He wandered far and wide over the earth , and all the time his one desire was to degrade himself and disgrace the name of Muller . At last he came to Marutea , still planning some revenge that would break his father 's heart . Then came the inspiration . He married an island woman , daughter of the chief of Marutea , but still a native , and when he had two children by her he sent all the way to Tahiti for a photographer to come to the island . He dressed himself , his wife , and their two children like the lowest of savages . They were photographed in this fashion before a palm-thatched hovel . He then sent home his marriage certificate and one of these photographs , inscribed , ' To my father , from Otto Muller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wake up .. . like that ! ' and he snapped his fingers . ' I am a man who has been mad , who has had an evil dream . Now it is gone ; I am a Muller again , and my good German blood speaks to me . I have taken a terrible revenge ; but it is too late now ? the harm is done . I killed my father ? that I was told by one of my brothers . His pride was broken forever . The anger I have kept so long leave me , and I again wish to makesomething of my life . I have a wife . I have children I love ; they are of the best Polynesian blood ; I have no need to be ashamed . I see that I must build up my life here , on this island . When I come out of my bad dream I begin to plan , to create . This island shall be a kingdom for me , and all of these people shall be my children . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take charge of their affairs . ' Then returned his great love and longing for music . He had sworn never to play or sing again , but with the first money he earned as a trader he sent for a piano . Gradually he sent for other things , so that he might live like a self-respecting German . VI That , in the barest outline , is the story he told me . When he had finished he rose , and I thought I was to be dismissed ; but no ? this was to be one of his musical evenings . One night in every week , he said , his people came to hear him play and sing . ' One must have music , nicht water ? You will see , my friend , how my people love this music . It is necessary . No longer can they live without it . ' Sure enough , when we walked out to the upstairs verandah , the whole village was gathering in the open space before his house . A chair was placed for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-legged on the ground , at a distance of twenty or thirty yards from the house . The piano was rolled out on the upstairs verandah and so placed that , while playing , Herr Muller would sit sidewise to his audience . Over it was suspended a gasoline vapor lamp , provided with a shade that threw the clear white light directly upon him . It was the nearest thing to a spotlight , I imagine , that he was able to devise . Presently a bell was struck ? three sonorous clangs . The late corners seated themselves hurriedly and the hum of conversation died away . There must have been well over two hundred people in the audience . We waited in deep silence for some little time ; then Herr Muller appeared , in full evening dress , as he might have appeared on the concert stage in Hanover . A fine figure he made as he came forward to the verandah railing and stood , resting his hands upon it , looking down at us . At the moment of his appearance the audience started a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to right and left ; then he seated himself at the piano . Picture , if you can , that strange scene . It was a perfect tropic night , windless and clear . From the far side of the island came the faint thunder of the surf , giving a voice to mid-ocean solitude , and behind us lay the lagoon with the stems of the palms outlined in silhouette against it . Herr Miller 's audience was all but invisible in the deep shade of the puka trees , but here and there a gleam of moonlight outlined a bare brown leg , the contour of a cheek , or the curve of a naked shoulder . The intense light of the vapor lamp fell full upon him , deepening the gloom outside . I wish that I might have known his thoughts at that moment . One thing seemed quite certain : he was no longer at Marutea . He was in Germany ? in Munich , perhaps , or Berlin , before a vast audience of his fellow countrymen . He was at the summit of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being . He sat for a moment with his head bowed , his fingers resting lightly on the keys . Then he sang Wagner 's Evening Star . ' ' Oh , du mein holder Abendgern . I can hear the words at this moment , sung , and powerfully sung , in his deep and splendid voice . I admit that I was stirred . I had not known what to expect of this performance . In outlining his story , I have said little of his superb self-confidence , his unshakable belief that his father had wrecked the career of one of the most promising singers in the whole of Germany . As I listened , I could easily believe that this might have been true . His voice had great range and flexibility , as well as power ; it was one that a much younger singer might well have been proud of . At the close of the song , prolonged and hearty applause broke out . He rose and bowed in his courtly manner to right and left . I could see tears trickling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was something inexpressibly pathetic , to me , in this makeshift of an audience , of a setting , that circumstances had forced him to accept and be content with ; and yet it seemed to serve his purpose . Make-believe , if indulged in long enough by a man passionately eager to delude himself , may become almost as good as reality . So it was here , I think . What Herr Muller needed was an audience , the heartening sound of two hundred pairs of hands clapping vigorously at the close of each of his numbers . The rest he could himself provide . He had only to close his eyes to believe , for the moment at least , that all of his dreams had come true . Naturally the thought came to me : How spontaneous is this applause ? Remembering that these concerts had been taking place over a period of many years , I could imagine that his audience might have become bored with them . Furthermore , Polynesian music differs vastly from ours , and it was hard to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagner , or Schubert , or Chopin . I watched with interest the faces of those near me , and , whatever the song or the 2 0 THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY instrumental number , they remained as placid and seemingly unmoved as the coconut palms . I observed that the applause was always started by the same old man . As long as he clapped , the others clapped ; when he stopped , they stopped . Herr Muller saw nothing of this , of course , and he may have known nothing of it . These weekly concerts were given by his royal command , but in my opinion he truly believed that the natives attended for the pleasure they derived from them and not because of the fear which his dominating character inspired . VII I shall pass quickly over the events of the following month . It was a busy , anxious , and happy time for me . Herr Muller had given us the use of one of his coral-cement copra houses for a studio . It stood on the lagoon beach , half a mile from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my film driers , and the rest of our gear . Herr Milner was kindness itself in helping us to get comfortably settled . At first he was like a child in his eagerness to see us at work ; but as the days passed I became conscious of a change in his attitude . He tried hard not to show it , but I could see that he resented the new interest we had brought into the lives of his people . It deprived him , not of any of his authority , to be sure , but of the position he had held for so long in the very centre of the Marutea stage . I did everything possible to keep him there . Never did we miss attendance at his weekly concerts , and I saw to it that there should be no distractions for which we were responsible on those particular evenings . Nevertheless , I was not easy in mind , and worked as never before to complete the filming of the picture in the briefest possible time . With a host of such violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared , of course , was that he might command us to leave the island before the work was finished . Days passed , and everything went smoothly . We had splendid luck . The weather ? everything ? was in our favor . As for the company , they surpassed my most hopeful expectations . Half a dozen rehearsals sufficed to show the natives what we wanted : simply a pictorial story of their lives as they lived it from day to day , ? fishing , pearl diving , housebuilding , dancing , ? all their individual and communal activities strung on the thread of a story concerning one family . They were wholly unselfconscious before the camera ; not once in a dozen times was a retake necessary . I saw little of our host during working hours , but I passed more than one pleasant evening in his company . One day he sent me word that he was going on one of his periodical visits to another smaller village on an island fifteen miles distant across the lagoon . He was to be absent for ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while he was away , I all but forgot his existence . His son Otto acted as my interpreter and general factotum . Otto and I had struck up a warm friendship during the long voyage to Marutea , and it had grown since that time . It was interesting to see how he expanded and throve during his father 's absence , and the effect was equally noticeable upon the rest of the people . They were like children who had been granted an unexpected holiday . Nearly everyone in the village belonged to my company , and by this time their interest in the picture was enormous . Meanwhile , Crossland and Zimmerman had been working late every evening developing film . I was looking forward to projecting the pictures . I wanted to show the company the results of our work , and I knew that I could better explain what remained to be done by letting them see themselves in the shots already taken . At last we were ready , and I informed the village that if they would come to the studio that evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this while . We rigged up our screen out of doors , against one of the walls of the copra house . The whole village came . Otto and perhaps half a dozen others had seen motion pictures at Tahiti when they had gone there with Herr Muller 's schooner . The others had little conception of what would be forthcoming . At first their astonishment was so great that they sat in complete silence ; then they went half crazy with delight . They laughed , they yelled , they rushed up to the screen to convince themselves that those moving figures were merely pictures and not their own flesh and blood . I had to stop the show until we could quiet them down a little . Otto explained that they must remain seated and not throw their shadows on the , : Teen . We were in the midst of the performance when I heard , or thought I heard , the ringing of the bell at Herr Miiller 's house . I had a decidedly uneasy momentv I remembered that this was the usual evening for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return and knew that he was not expected back for several days . Zimmerman was at the camera . I strolled a little way down the beach and listened again for the bell . Not hearing it , I decided that I must have been mistaken . Certainly none of the audience had heard it , which was not strange , considering the noise they were making . When the performance was over they begged to see it again . I was glad to comply , and while repeating it I explained to them , through Otto , the work yet to be done , and how the various scenes would fit into place when all had been taken . We were getting on famously . Otto was in the midst of one of his explanations when he stopped short as though he had been smitten dumb . Following his awe-struck glance , I saw his father standing at the rear of the crowd . He was in evening dress , his concert costume , and stood drawn up to his full height , his arms folded across his mighty chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not a word was said . Otto began to move backward as though some mysterious force were pushing him away . He melted into the darkness . Every member of the audience followed him . They neither walked nor ran ? they simply vanished , without a sound . Within thirty seconds the place was deserted except for Zimmerman at the camera , Herr Milner , and myself . I was prepared for anything . I was prepared to see him step forward and smash our precious camera to bits . Had he offered to do so , I doubt whether Zimmerman or I would have lifted a finger to prevent him . I have spoken of his immense vitality . It was more than that ; what , precisely , I can not explain , but the influence , whatever it was , seemed to rob us , for the moment , of everything but the capacity to feel it . He came forward two or three paces , breathing heavily , as though he had run all the way from his house . He raised his ironwood stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though about to speak ; but instead of doing so he turned and strode off into the darkness . VIII I passed a sleepless night . My first impulse had been to follow him , but upon second thought it seemed best to allow time for his anger to cool before making any attempt to explain . I was certain that no one had been informed of his return . Had it been known , Otto would have told me . We were to have started work at daylight the next morning . No one came ? not a soul . I waited for an hour , and then went along to the village . A few children were playing about in the dooryards ; otherwise the village street was deserted , but I saw faces peeping concernedly out at me as I went along . I found Otto and a younger brother , Walter , at the store . They greeted me in subdued , anxious voices . They had not dared speak to their father . He had forbidden the people to leave their houses without his permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tread on the staircase . The two sons , with frightened apologetic glances at me , disappeared into a back room . I was ready to bring into play all the tact and diplomacy learned in twenty years of motion-picture directing . Fortunately they were not needed . All that I had to do was to point out that he himself was responsible for the failure of his people to attend his concert . He had returned home several days before he was expected , and late in the evening , after everyone had left the village to come to our picture show . I assured him that no one had heard the ringing of the bell . Strangely enough , this simple explanation had not even occurred to him . Mr. Forrest ! What a fool I am ! ' he said . ' Yes , it is so ! I am like my father . I lose my temper and then I remember nothing , not even why I have lost it ! You will not be angry with me ? You are working so hard to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great cities this lonely island and the life of my people , so strange , so romantic , and I . . . ' He shook his head , ruefully . ' You will forgive me ? Tell me , what can I do to show you how deeply I am sorry ? ' Forgive him ? Indeed I did , what little there was to forgive . When truly himself , he had the most charming manners ? a gracious , old-world courtesy rarely met with anywhere . The difficult thing for me to realize , in all my dealings with him , was that I had to do with a man who , in many respects , had never grown up . Intellectually he was splendidly mature , and yet he had the capacity for intense suffering of a sensitive , imaginative child . With him a slight , however small , and whether fancied or real , grew in a moment to enormous proportions , completely overshadowing the light of his day . I almost envied him that virginity of spirit . Had it not been for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Nothing would do then but we must have one of our long talks . I excused myself as delicately as possible . ' I was rather hoping to go on with a scene we started filming yesterday , Herr Muller , if the people could come . . . ? ' He slapped his forehead . Donnerwetterl I forget ! Of course ! You wish to work , and I have told them . . . Ach , du Heber Gott , what a man I am ! Otto ! Walter ! Come ! Come quickly ! ' They appeared from the back room , and their father galvanized them into action at once . Walter ran up to ring the bell which hung at the end of the upper verandah . The natives came thronging from their houses on to the village recreation ground in front of the store . I wish that you might have heard him address them . He was now in his happiest mood ; he laughed with them , joked with them , and the effect was immediate . If they feared him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . // Now , Mr. Forrest , what will you have them do ? Ach , how can you forgive me who make you waste so much of this beautiful morning ? Along with Otto ! No , wait ! You shall stay you , Otto ! 9 ? at home . It is I who shall go with Mr. Forrest to-day . I shall work hard , hard ! You will see . Come , my children , all of you ! ' What a day it was ! We accomplished more than in any four days previously . We filmed two scenes in particular that removed any doubts I may have had as to the ultimate success of the picture . I am prouder of that afternoon 's work than of all my years of directing , either before or since , and the credit belongs to Herr Muller . He could have made a success of a dozen different careers , motion-picture directing among them . He knew by instinct what I wanted done ; and with his knowledge of island life , and his deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priceless to me . IX If only I could have let well enough alone ! Well enough ? It was vastly better than well enough . I had a feeling of deep obligation toward him , and in my desire to show it I blundered . My intentions were of the best , but I do n't excuse myself . The consequences of that blunder were tragic . You see , there was something more than pathetic , to me , in the immense need he had for his people 's admiration and respect , not as a man and a leader , ? that he could and did take for granted , ? but as a musician , a singer of genius . He had brooded so long over his ruined career ; his spiritual pain at the thought of it was , I am convinced , all but unbearable at times . It was softened somewhat by his belief that his gifts had not been entirely wasted ; that even here , among children of na ture whom most people would regard as little above savages , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day how vital it was to his happiness that he should believe the Maruteans deeply loved his music . I wanted him to keep that illusion , if it was an illusion . It seemed to me that if I could help him keep it I should be doing as great a service as it is possible for one man to perform for another . Well , I encouraged him to believe that our picture was nothing to his people in comparison with his music . He could not help seeing their interest , but I made light of it , and convinced him that it was merely the interest in novelty and would quickly pass . He was wistfully eager to believe me . You feel that , Mr. Forrest ? ' he said earnestly . His eyes lighted up with pleasure and he laid a hand affectionately on my shoulder . ' One sees that you are truly an artist ! We know , you and I , that music stands first , nicht wahr ? Yes , it is so , in all lands , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among these Polynesians , there is this great passion for music . ' We were walking back through the groves , from the studio to his house . He halted and faced me . ' You know , we can prove that , ' he said . How ? ' I asked . ' I tell you what we do , ' he went on , eagerly . ' Some evening soon you will again show the pictures ? . . . Good ! Well , I will say to my people : " Mr. Forrest will show the new scenes he has been making with you . Do you wish to see them ? " And they will say , " Yes . " " Very well , my children , " I will say ; " those who wish to go may do so . I shall have my concert on this evening , but no matter ; I wish you to do as you like . You shall see the pictures if that pleases you better , and I shall sing and play for myself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I tried not to show my alarm . Herr Muller , ' I said , we should have not one spectator at our picture show . ' Gavin ! ' he said , laughing delightedly . ' I believe that , too , so much they love the music . ' Then why prove what we both already know ? ' To make a little more sure . We have this wonderful chance ; never again , perhaps , will it happen , anywhere . There are ignorant men , Mr. Forrest , who think these island people are savages who care only to eat and sleep . We know how wrong is their idea ; and you can say , after you leave my island , when you hear their foolish talk , " But let me tell you what I know . " ' There was no dissuading him . I tried in every possible way , only to increase his enthusiasm for the plan . He pressed me to set an evening for the double attraction . I delayed day after day , made excuse after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be turned from his purpose , and at last I was compelled to comply . I had a possible resource in Otto . Although we had never spoken of the native attitude toward his father 's music , I knew how he felt about it in his heart : that it was both fear and love that compelled attendance at the weekly concerts . I told him that he must warn the people , secretly , not to come to the studio on that evening , promising them another showing of pictures the following night . Otto shook his head . ' My father would be sure to hear of it , Mr. Forrest , and he would be very angry . He would think you did not believe in : the love of our people for his music , and wished to save him from being disappointed . He is a proud man ; he would never forgive you for that . No , there is nothing we can do . It must be as he wishes . ' X I made my preparations with a heavy heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at his word , or that a sense of loyalty to him would prevent their attendance . That hope soon faded . They came in twos and threes , in family groups , the girls and young men , the middle-aged . Only the Mailer children and a few of the old people were missing ; otherwise all the natives were seated on the ground before the screen , eagerly waiting for us to begin . If they were at all worried as to what Herr Miller would think , it was not apparent in their manner . For the moment , at least , they seemed to have quite forgotten him . At another time I should have enjoyed the animation of that scene , but my heart was with Herr Muller . I recalled his words : On that evening , Mr. Forrest , I shall have a great emotion , a very great emotion . I shall sing as never before . ' I dared not think of the great empty square before his house . But the harm was done , now . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the camera ; I had sent Zimmerman to attend the concert . I remained at the studio only long enough to inspect one bit of film I had been particularly anxious to see ; then I set out for the village as fast as I could walk . We had the same wildly appreciative audience . I could hear their shouts of delight long after I had left the studio . Herr Muller was singing when I arrived ; the song was ' Heilige Nacht . ' It was only then that I remembered we were in Christmas week ; there were no seasonable reminders at Marutea . I forgot the tropics as I listened to that timeless old song . I had never before LORD OF heard it sung by a man ; I did n't suppose that it could be . Now I know that only a man ? if he be German , with the voice of a Muller ? can sing it as it should be sung . It was lovely , unspeakably so . It seemed to me that I was hearing it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place , and all my anxieties . When it was finished I came back with an effort to the little world of Marutea lost in the wastes of the Pacific . The great square before Herr Muller 's house was all but empty . The Muller children were present , and a dozen or fifteen of the old people . All applauded heartily , and I clapped till the palms of my hands burned , but the effect , in volume , was nothing compared to what was customary at these concerts . Herr Muller rose and bowed , but he seemed scarcely aware of our presence at the moment . He was deeply stirred ; the spell he had cast upon one , at least , of his audience was upon him as well . I sought out Zimmerman immediately . In a rapidly whispered conference he told me that Herr Muller had given no indication that he was aware of the smallness of his audience . As a matter of fact , they had spread themselves over a wide area in an effort to make their numbers appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , undoubtedly . The moon was again in its second quarter and the light fell in pools and splashes among the trees . It would have been easy for Herr Muller to be deceived as to the numbers of his audience , the more so because his eyes were accustomed to the brilliant light from his vapor lamp . I tried to persuade myself that he was deceived . Believing that the situation might yet be saved , I asked Zimmerman to hurry back to the studio and stop our performance , telling the people to come at once to the concert . MARUTEA However , thinking of the distance , I was apprehensive . Twenty minutes at least would pass before any of them could appear . Meanwhile , Herr Muller proceeded with the concert . He sang next one of Heine 's lyrics set to music by himself . It was as fragrant of a northern spring as an apple tree in blossom . I tell you , the man was a genius ! I could easily imagine him in Carnegie Hall in New York , the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them deeply moved , as the human heart will always be moved by simple and beautiful things . Again I applauded like a dozen men , and so did the others . The applause was genuine , too ; at least mine was . A tenderness welled up in my heart , a deep longing to please the fine old fellow ; to make good to him , somehow , all his years of loneliness , of homesickness , of unrealized dreams . This time he did not rise from his stool ; he seemed to be in a deep reverie . Then he played the Moonlight Sonata . Ghosts of old memories , of places , people , evoked by associations the music had for me , came thronging back . It was strange indeed to think that there could be no such memories for the others of that tiny gathering . I thought : Never shall I forget this ! Never ! From this night on , the Moonlight Sonata will mean Marutea to me . ' And so it does ; so it always will . If ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to conjure up again all its loneliness and beauty . Of a sudden the music was broken off , in the middle of a bar . I looked up quickly . Herr Muller had risen from his stool . He came to the verandah railing and stood looking down at us . Then , in a low dead voice , he said , Go home . I shall play no more ' ; and , without waiting to see his command obeyed , he disappeared through a doorway . XI The little gathering dispersed ; they seemed to float away rather than to walk . There were a dozenller children , married and unmarried , from the ages of forty-odd to eighteen . Two of the younger ones lived with their father ; the others had homes of their own near by . They stood for a moment , conversing in whispers , looking toward the house . The intense white light from the vapor lamp seemed to spill like water over the piano keys to the floor , and the instrument cast a block of impenetrable shadow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the desire or the capacity for thought . I rose and made my way slowly to the beach , walking on for a hundred yards or so ; there I sat down facing the lagoon , with my back to a tree . A few moments later I saw someone approaching . It was Otto . He sat down beside me . Presently he said , ' He is in his bedroom , Mr. Forrest , walking up and down . I am afraid when he is like this . ' What do you think we should do , Otto ? ' Nothing . We must wait and see . ' From far down the beach we heard a murmur of voices . The people were returning from our picture show . Otto hurried along to meet them , to tell them to go very quietly to their houses . They separated in silence among the groves ; those who lived on the farther side of the village kept to the beach as they passed Herr Miiller 's house . Within five minutes the last of them had gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wandered away from the house and back to it half a dozen times during the next two hours . The vapor lamp still burned . We were like moths attracted to it again and again . It must have been well after mid- night that we came for the last time , standing in the deep shade , waiting , listening , hearing nothing . We were about to move away for another quarter of an hour of aimless wandering when the curtains at one of the doorways parted and Herr Muller came out . His movements were like those of a sleepwalker . He sat down on the piano stool with his back to the instru. ment , his elbows on his knees , his chin resting in his hands . He remained motionless for a long time . Suddenly he turned to the piano , squaring his shoulders proudly . I could not see his face , only his magnificent head with its mass of thick snow-white hair , clearly outlined in the brilliant light of the lamp . He let his hands fall lightly on the keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . The music of the mingled notes had in it a quality of unutterable loneliness ; it was as though some desolate spirit of mid-ocean had uttered a cry of profound despair . That was all ? a single chord . Silence flowed in again ; I could hear the faint hiss of the vapor lamp . We waited , and I was hoping that he would play , finding an outlet in music for whatever emotion gripped him . Instead of that he sprang from the stool with an inarticulate cry that froze my blood . He disappeared within doors and returned with an axe in his hand . How am Ito describe what happened next ? Have you ever seen and heard a piano being murdered ? I am not speaking of piano music done to death by a novice . No ? of the instrument itself , beaten , chopped , hacked , splintered , mangled , with an axe wielded by a man with the strength of a giant and the demoniac passion of . . . of nothing human . I doubt whether such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With all his enormous strength he swung the axe again , and again , and again , and again ? first on the keyboard , then on the beautiful body of the piano whose wood had been so permeated , so mellowed with music through the years . It was as though one were watching a god , who had created order and beauty and harmony , seized of a sudden by the horrible need to destroy all that he had won from chaos and night , himself with it . I leave you to imagine , if you can , the tortured cries that came from the instrument at each blow . How long its agony lasted I do not know ? possibly two or three minutes , though the time seemed endless to me . Then Herr Muller hurled the axe away from him . It flew far out , whirling round and round , and fell not a dozen paces from where Otto and I were standing . When I looked again toward the verandah , Herr Muller had crouched behind what was left of the instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two legs , and it was hurled rather than pushed across the verandah . The railings splintered like matchwood at the impact , and the instrument fell with a rending crash to the ground , fifteen feet below . Otto and I had stood , deprived of the power of thought or movement by the horror of what we saw . Now he cried out , Oh , Mr. Forrest ! Tomorrow ! To-morrow ! ' I knew what he meant . But there was to be no to-morrow for his father . He was mercifully spared the anguish he would have known at the realization of what he had done . He swayed for a second or two at the very edge of the verandah , outlined in silhouette against the light of the vapor lamp . Suddenly he raised his hands to his head , staggered back two or three paces , and fell . Regaining our power of action , Otto and I ran to the outdoor stairway at the end of the verandah , but we were not the first to reach him . He was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lap of a lovely old lady who I knew at once must be Mrs. Muller , although I had never seen her before . She paid no attention to us ; she was not aware of our presence . She was seated cross-legged on the floor , running her slim brown fingers through his hair . His face looked as peaceful as that of a child asleep . Auhl Aug ! Otto id gl Atli ! Au ? l ' I shall never be able to forget that little wailing cry , so tender , so infinitely melancholy , repeated over and over again . ' Alas ! Alas ! ' Words other than those were useless . There was nothing more to be said . He must have burst a blood vessel in his brain . However that may be , he was dead . I remained in the house only long enough to be certain of this . The place was now filling with people ; I was neither wanted nor needed there . I made my way down the stairs and through the throng gathered outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended his story at this point . No one spoke for a moment or two ; then someone asked , in a tentative , apologetic voice : ' You finished the picture ? ' Yes , ' he replied , rising . ' I was obliged to do that . '
