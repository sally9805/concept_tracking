Orpheus , son of Apollo , played his lyre so well that birds and beasts were stilled and oak trees moved from their places to listen . Even Cerberus , the three-headed guardian of Hades , was lulled to sleep when the musician tried to bring Eurydice back from the dead . Jealous Thracian maidens killed Orpheus who was buried in Libethra where the nightingales are supposed to sing more sweetly than in any other part of Greece . He is remembered as the God of Music . <P> Ten years ago Sculptor Carl Milles , recalling this familiar legend , won a competition with a sketch of a fountain to be placed in front of Stockholm 's Concert Hall . Last week Carl Milles had finished the last of the plaster models of his Orpheus group . He and they were on their way to Stockholm where the models will be cast in dark green bronze . The fountain will be completed in 1936 . <P> In 1929 Architect Eliel Saarinen invited Sculptor Milles to teach and work at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in pleasant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created his huge Orpheus fountain which many of his admirers consider the greatest of his great work. * Milles modeled an Orpheus descending from Heaven , his lyre resting on his left shoulder , his right hand plucking its invisible strings . Directly beneath Orpheus a stylized Cerberus is about to doze off into careless sleep . Around the rim of the fountain nude figures are arrested in various postures by the strains of Orpheus ' music . A very young girl in her rapture drops a flower . More mature is a girl who lifts her hands in surprise , turns her head to hear whence the music comes . A third girl turns haughtily as if to resist the spell . Most mature is the woman who was arranging her hair when Orpheus began to play . She suggests a worldly , sated figure to whom spiritual beauty has suddenly been revealed . A youth lifts his hand as if he were trying to catch the music . A man , holding a bird , motions it to be quiet while he listens . <P> " I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The only one is Beethoven . " The deaf composer , his body lean and naked , his face seamed with anguish , raises imploring hands . <P> In the Orpheus fountain , water will spurt up as high as the knees of Orpheus . Dripping lines of water from the teeth of Cerberus will harmonize perpendicularly with the legs of the figure . Human torsos representing shades in Hades have been carved into parts of the angular unsymmetrical base . When the fountain works they , like the dead , will seem to float in the mists of another world .
