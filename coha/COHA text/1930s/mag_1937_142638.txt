When Australia 's Vivian McGrath appeared on the international tennis scene four years ago , experts could not have been more astonished had he been a kangaroo . For all backhand shots McGrath held his racket with both hands . For a first-class tennist to do such a thing was so unthinkable that tennis experts , instead of trying to explain it , simply regarded McGrath as an antipodean freak . Last week this point of view was confirmed when in Mexico City an Australian team played Mexico in the first round of the Davis Cup tournament . On the team was another Australian who held his racket with both hands . <P> As a freak tennis player , Australia 's John Bromwich ( pronounced Brumage ) makes McGrath 's methods look banal . He is ambidextrous . He serves with his right hand , switches to his left for shots on that side , plays shots on his right side with both hands ( see cut ) . Like 21-year-old McGrath , Bromwich is not only a freak but a prodigy . He was just 16 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating Adrian Quist and Don Turnbull , seasoned Australian internationalists . In Mexico City last week Bromwich 's Davis Cup debut was a severe thrashing for Mexico 's Esteban Reyes , 6-2 , 6-2 , 7-5 . Four other victories , in which his teammates ( McGrath , Quist , Crawford ) lost only one set , put Australia in the second round , five matches to none . <P> With England 's Fred Perry retired from amateur tennis , the outcome of this year 's Davis Cup Tournament , of which the interzone final starts at Wimbledon July 17 , followed by the challenge round July 24 , is considered a toss-up between England , Australia , Germany and the U. S. Australia is a slight favorite . Last week , in five other Davis Cup matches scattered all over the world , the tournament got off to a flying start . Results : <P> In San Francisco , After a winter of bickering as to who would be the ablest partner for red-haired Donald Budge , U. S. No. 1 , the U. S. Davis Cup Committee finally picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Budge 's doubles partner . Against Jiro Yamagishi , Japanese singles champion , Parker surprised everyone by winning the only match about which there was much doubt , 6-3 , 2-6 , 8-6 , 6-1 . His teammates handily won the other four , qualified to meet Australia in the American Zone final at Forest Hills , May 29-31 . <P> In Brighton , England , New Zealand nosed out China , three matches to two . <P> In Budapest , Belgium beat Hungary 3-to-2 . <P> In Amsterdam , South Africa beat The Netherlands 5-to-0 . <P> In Montreux , Switzerland beat Ireland 3-to-2.
