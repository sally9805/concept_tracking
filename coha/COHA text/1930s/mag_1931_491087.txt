HEAVYWEIGHT champion of the world ought to he popular . It is supposed to go with the title . I was champion fur seven years . For the first three or four years I was unpopular , maybe the most unpopular heavyweight champion in the history of the ring , I um sorry to say . Jim Corbett was an unpopular champion for a time because he had whipped a great popular idol , John L. Sullivan , and Sullivan 's worshipers could n't forgive him . Moreover , Corbett was a skilled boxer , Sullivan a slugger , and the public 's taste runs to slugging . They like power better than skill . But . Jess Willard , from whom . I won the championship , was no Sullivan in the ring or out . He was a better man than he usually is given credit for being , but he was not colorful , did not like the business and showed it plainly . There was no question about my right to the title , and the old-timers said that my ring style was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Jeffries , at least . I liked the game and all that went with it , and showed it . I was an American with a good Irish name and , by all the rules , that ought to have been in my favor . The public had n't eared much about Willard one way or the other , but inc ' they disliked . I 'm sorry to have to dig up an old sore , but not long after I won the title a group saw a chance of getting me out of their way . They spread the story that I was a particularly mean kind of draft dodger , and stirred up such a newspaper storm that 1 was indicted and tried . They had nothing special against me personally , but if I had been convicted , they had candidates of their own to shove forward fur the title .

The fire was out , but the air still was thick with smoke . Here I was a world champion , and a villain instead of a hero . I was not even getting the money supposed to go with the title , for fights were hard to find . When I finally met Carpentier at Jersey City in 1921 I 'm afraid there is no doubt but I hat two out of three Americans hoped that the Frenchman would whip me . In fact , 1 have heard it said that a general desire to see me knocked cold was what drew that record gate . paid big money for that fight , more money than I supposed there was , and I liked that part of it .

Au unknown country boy might work up to heavyweight champion in three years , but it ought to take longer than that to learn how to be a great villain to scare children with . I hope you do n't think I am crying about it , for it is ancient history now , and never was so important except to me , but I was young and green and couldn't. understand it . Sometimes I got so disgusted that I wished I was right back where I started from . Puzzling it out , I argued that I liked people and that people scorned to like me when they knew me .

If this was so , then I ought to get out and mix more with people . Sometime about 1920 I made up my mind that I had to sell myself , as they say , to the American people , and I have been working at it ever since , never harder than now . The trouble was that the only thing I knew was the ring . Mind you , I left school when I was thirteen . I do n't think it is an accident that anyone ever gets to be a champion in any line . No one ever concentrated on his job more than I did on learning mine . From the time I was fifteen or so , I ate light , slept fight , breathed it , dreamed it , and when I had the chance I worked at it . Everything I know about boxing 1 learned by practice , experiment and studying other lighters . And while I liked to light , liked it better than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody ever knew how ambitious I was . I did n't always act like it , but I wanted to get somewhere about as much as a boy can want . 1 knew I did n't have the education to do anything in most lines , and the only natural ability I could see that I had was for lighting . A boy does n't work these things out on paper , but I had it in the back of my head . So while I took up the trade because it was easiest and must interesting , it also was because there was a gambling chance to reach the top in it . Even with a good education , a man who concentrates on one thing soon becomes single-tracked . It was worse with me , because I knew nothing else to begin with , and the time was past when a champion only had to hold his liquor to hold his friends . Learrzing , a New Set of Ropes TACK KEAITNS took care of every detail outside e , . ) my actual job . As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my share . When they switched the subject , I was struck dumb and self-conscious . The first public appearance I ever made outside the ring was in December , 1018 , at a Sunday night concert at a Brooklyn burlesque house . As semi as I was =tidied to meet Willard , offers for // these appearances began to come in . We wore paid one hundred dollars for this one . Kearns and I rode on a street cur to within three blocks of the theater , then got off and walked so they would n't see us arrive on a five-cent fare . Coming up the street , we saw my name in lights in front of the theater . Kearns slapped me on the back and said ; " Take a look at . that ! Did n't I tell you I 'd make you a champion ? " Backstage , a girl suggested that I would need make-up and rubbed rouge on my face , and the manager said I ought . to say a few words . Leonard Sacks wrote a short speech on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bottom of a shoe box and held it up from the wings so I could see it . Kearns stepped out , introduced me as the next heavyweight champion of the world , and I was pushed on . ' rho audience applauded for what seemed like five minutes , and may have been thirty seconds . Anyway , it seared what was left of my wits out of me , and about that time an electrician turned the spotlight on me . I just stood there . A man in the front row laughed , then another laugh down front . In a momenta snicker was running through the house and then everybody was laughing . The people in the wino were hissing at me to start talking . Kearns was point ing at my cuff and Sacks was waving the bottom of the shoe box , but I was paralyzed and the cold sweat started . The audience began wadding up programs and throwing them at me and finally someone yelled : " Get the hook ! " They dropped the curtain on me , still frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they bad to lead me off the stage . The way out of backstage led through a saloon . As we passed through , a man at the bar slammed down his glass and said : " If that guy elver will make a champion , I can make a watch . " I was so mad that I wanted to go back and show him how to make a watch , but Kearns and Sacks pulled me along . Roiling Stone Gathers Polish T DID N'T start out by buying a set of curl . respondence-school or etiquette books , or taking up French in ten lessons . A champion has money , leisure , he travels and he meets all sorts of people . These are bound to rub off the worst of the rough edges . What I did do was to start keeping my eyes and ears open , rending more than the sport page , and concentrating on everybody I met . When I met people in a crowd , I tried to fix their names and fares in my mind with the place I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw them again , and I found that the memory is like a muscle . If there was a chance to talk with a man in private , I listened to him , not politely but interestedly , asked him about his own business , tried to draw him out a little . Anyone can learn a lot about many I hinga by just being interested and asking questions . A champion or any public character is like a pulltician . The public is his boss and it pays to be pleasant to your boss . If you happen to like the boss , too , it is easier to be pleasant than not to he , and as I have said , I always have liked people and wanted everybody to like me. ( letting over being shy and clumsy with them was just a mat ter of practice . The more you meet , the easier it is . If they liked me they might come to see me light . Anyway , they would tell everyone that they had met the champion and that he was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of propaganda I needed . People do not necessarily like a champion because they crowd around him . Judging by the attention I attracted , I always was popular , tut auyone who gets his picture in the papers often enough is a freak . They run to see you as they would to see an elephant winner . Some folks are always for the under dog . and more get bored after a while with a winner , feel that he probably is taking himself too seriously and that it is time someone knocked the conceit out of him . Then when it is done , as likely as not , they do an about-face and say that the fallen champ was a great one and that it will be a long time before we see his like again . That is all part of the game . But you ca n't convince me ( hut I did n't have something to do with the change in the public 's attitude .

The Strenuous Job of Retirement N E T X to tieing elaimpion , the best job in our trade is that of ex-ehampion . What 's more , it was the only job I hail , and 1 decided to make the most of it . The defeated champ used in open a saloon , but that is n't lasing dune any rips uywity , Corbett showed that the job had bigger I.ilitiess than drinking at your own bar . I have lean a great admirer of Jim Corbett ever situp I first heard of him , and probably have had him in my mind as a pattern . or an automobile smash-up . Any lighter or baseball player knows how fickle the fans are . They Omer one minute and boo the next . Bet shake I heir hands and van them by name , and they usually adopt you for life .

By Itrsti. whim I lost the championship to Tunney , 1 think I laid pretty sell lived down the reputation that was given me in 1920 . Not that all the world was my friend . There were plenty in the stadium at Philadelphia and listening on the radio who wanted Tannest to win . Your opponent has his friends too . A boxing bout is pretty personal , and the promoters and newspapers work up as much feeling as they can . It would be a poor championship tight that did n't stir up the fans to take sides . It is generally said that 1 am much more popular in defeat than I was in victory . Part of that is because I lost , It is n't true that the world always loves a I was not broke . I had seen too many broken-down boxers . They used to give me bud dreams , and . I told myself that if I ever made real money I would put cones away .

( ha . day I heard that the richest man in Utah , wort Ii millions , had lost everything ; that he would n't have had a dime if be had not had a trust fund .

I could have retired and lived fairly well on these funds , but 1 was only thirty-one when I lost the championship , thirty-I wit when 1 fought the last time . I never had much training at loafing and would n't make a success of it . Jess Willard went into iCentletu  --  d en Para 103 ) real estate in Hollywood , but he always had the makings of a business man and I never had . Anyone who knows me will tell you that I am nervous and restless and must be doing something . I had gotten used to spending more nyney than the trust funds brought in , and I would have missed the crowds and the excitement . I guess it is the excitement most of all . Someone asked me recently how I liked to spend my spare time . I like to play cards  --  pinochle , hearts , rummy , bridge  --  play a little golf , though I am a duffer ; I like shows and all kinds of sports , boxing best . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is n't enough spare time to worry about it . I fly a good deal these days to keep up with my refereeing dates . You ca n't talk much to anyone in a plane and they ca n't talk to you . You can read , look out the window or sleep . and I usually am so short on sleep that I do that . On day rides on trains it is sort of expected of you to leave your stateroom door open so anyone who feels like it can drop in and shake hands . The little golf I play is n't all the exercise I take , of course , but the rest . comes under the head of business . It is part of the job to stay in shape physically . Muscles turn to fat when they are not kept busy , and I have a frame that is inclined to fat anyway . It wouldn't. be any trouble to grow a stomach . An Average Day So I watch what I eat , take setting-up exercises morning and night or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , I work out in a gymnasium , shadow boning , sparring , wrestling , bag punching or on the apparatus . I even continue to do some road work and w hile I 'm about Len pounds heavier than my ring weight , this could be worked off quickly . I do this , in the first place , because I feel better , sleep better and think better . The system is so used to iL that it demands it . If I let my weight take its natural course , I would feel as seedy as I looked . As long us I trade on having been a champion , the public naturally expects me to look like one . It would boa. poor advertisement for boxing , too , and anything that is had for boxing is bad for me . An average day on the road goes something like this : Off the train and met by a reception committee made up of the local promoter , boxing commissioner , sport writers , radio announcers and business men interested in sport , many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more fans and curiosity seekers at the station and this crowd will attract others . Some will want to shako hands . I sign my name several hundred times a day , on curds , in albums , on baseballs , photographs . anything that will hold ink . Boys are the great autograph hounds , but men and women catch the idea from them . I do n't mind . I like it . One request for an autograph usually starts a long line and often I have to be rescued by the committee in order not to fall behind the schedule . At the hotel we take a suite of three rooms whether we are staying all night or not . One is a reception room where we hold open house , and the telephone seldom stops ringing . I must . visit the newspaper offices early . The sporting editors ask questions and the news photographers pose me . At noon there will be an invitation to speak at a Rotary , Kiwanis , Shriners , Lions or other lunch club . We arrive late , nibble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . They ca n't iliseover how bad you are in twenty words . I 've had plenty of practice at it by this time , but I 'm still a rotten speaker , and I like that part of the job least . We may call at City Hall to pay our respects to the mayor . Usually there is an orphanage , children 's hospital , old folks ' home or even a prison to visit . If a charity drive of any kind is under way , I make an appearance at headquarters or at a rally , say a few words mid am photographed . 1 r the town has a radio station , they work me into a vacant spot on the program for another few words . I do better when the announcer or a sport writer asks me questions in front of the mike . Always we are meeting old acquaintances and making new , shaking hands and stopping a minute to talk . A police escort usually is with us , for even in Now York a. crowd gathers when any celelirity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I do a brisk workout at a gym , with a rubdown . In the evening there will be either a public or a home dinner given by an official or old acquaintances , sometimes both , so we have to carry dinner clothes . Often the host or some other asks ins to visit the bedside of a sick relative or friend or to drop in on the children for a minute , and these always are commands . The local promoter is watching us anxiously to see that we are not late at the boxing or wrestling card I have come to referee . Ile is expecting to draw two or three times the normal house for an ordinary program on the strength of the ex-champion 's following , and he pays me considerably more than he does any of his boxers . Ordinardy we get a percentage . We slip in quietly after the first preliminary has started so as not to distract attention from the bout . Boxing is not flourishing as it . was , priori-pally because it lacks a heavyweight champion . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred rein the country and no one was in sight to take his place . To keep the fans on their toes , the sport needs a champion in the top class , and we hope to have one again soon . Refereeing Meanwhile I like to think that I am helping the game its well as myself in refereeing . My appearance is exlasaed to do two things . First , to renew the interest of old fans who have been staying away , and to attract new ones . Once they are interested , they will come haek of their own accord I he promoter does his part . Second , young boxers have a way of lining themselves out a lieu an ex-champion is in the ring with them . This is their chance to shine , and the audience gets the benefit . Refereeing is hard work . I am advertised le work only the main bout , but I ( 10 an extra one if the promoter wishes . A ten-round contest lasts forty minutes . The referee is on his feet all that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the ring , following the boxers , dodging them and prying them out of clinches . If they are heavyweights , the lust alone lakes a lot out of you . I always need a dry shirt afterward . But the mental strain bothers me more . Any referee or umpire is in tough spot to begin with . The crowd will be politer to me than to 1110 regular referee , but they will lie more critical . They may boo and hoot at what they think is a bad decision by the regular man , but forget it soon . When they do n't agree with me they may stay quiet , but they go away saying that as a referee Dempsey is a good movie actor . They may be right , at that . Any bout has to be mighty one-sided not to be seen differently by different eyes . In the first place , each boy has his own rooters . Rooters make tine ) Coneinu.d on Page 105 ) fCantieued from Page 103 ) fight fans , but poor judges sometimes . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from out-of-town , the crowd will be unevenly divided in its favor . Even if both boys are unknown to everybody , the spectators quickly choose up sides . Boxing is that kind of sport . The referee is in there scoring the boxers on points in each round . adding up the total at the end and holding up the hand of the high scorer , but the crowd may be led astray by this or that . If their sentiment is roused it will outweigh their reason every time . For example , I refereed a bout at Hartford the other night between two middleweights , O'Brien and Monolian . Although O'Brien was a local boy and Monolian from Boston , the crowd was fairly impartial to begin with . In the fourth round O'Brien knocked Monolian down . He got up , but was out on his feet . and O'Brien should have finished him easily . Monolien had no idea what he was doing , but his instinct kept him rolling along the ropes and guarding until the bell rang . He revived between the rounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This gallant recovery stirred the sympathies of the crowd , while O'Brien 's fumbling of his big opportunity disgusted them . When I held up O'Brien 's hand , there was silence , which I took to be disagreement , but he had won two to one on points . He had been the aggressor all along , had landed the only real blows and was unmarked himself . I gave Monoliau credit , of course , for his recovery , but that , as they say in bridge , only counted above the line . A fine retreat still is a retreat . The last bout over , we push our way , with the help of the police , through a tangle , mostly of boys , to the promoter 's office to settle up . Then another flying wedge to the automobiles and to the station to take a train to the next engagement , the reception committee seeing us off . When we get in the car , the rear-end flagman , the Pullman conductor or a passenger is ready to talk fight as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeper , the day is over . That is not so true in a hotel . Most of the fight business is done over the telephone , long-distance calls are cheapest late at night and business calls may start the phone ringing at any hour . Long ago I got so used to being wakened at night that 1 sleep by rounds . Sometimes I have to read or play a game of cards before I can fall asleep again . I ought to have seven or eight hours ' sleep , but go sometimes for weeks with only three or four a night . Cousin of RU the Dempseys At first , a boxer is surprised to find that everyone who wants to meet him isn't. necessarily a friend . Men sometimes start telling me they do n't like use while still shaking my hand . I wonder if politicians have that experience . They are n't looking for trouble ; they are just frank and earnest . The best method with them is to ask them to tell you all about it . When it 's off their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to explain . At least , we can agree to lot bygones be bygones and to be friends from hero on . The Dempseys are easy . I claim rc .. , lationship with every Dempsey and claim it first , asking about the family , where their father and mother and grandparents were born . lit Detroit a while back a white-whiskered old fellow from the Cumberland Mountains sent word backstage that he was a cousin of mine and wanted to see me . " Howdy , Cousin Jack , " he piped when he saw me . Probably he was some relation . My folks came from the West Virginia mountains . But to see what he would say , I asked him who told him we were cousins . He looked eighty if he was a. day . " Puppy told me , " he said . It looks like a Dempsey could expect to live to a ripe old age . Some of the Dempseys think I crawled in under the tent , and I have to show a birth certificate . When 1 first was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill me as an Italian , a Jew , a Pole or whatever suited the neighborhood best . The story was printed that I was a Levantine Jew , my real name Julius Shinsky ; and that yarn still bobs up . If a former champion is willing to he forgotten I suppose he can live us cheaply as anyone else , but if he wants to stay in the spotlight , the public demands that he play the good fellow . When traveling , our tipping hill averages about fifty dollars a day . It would n't be good business to make it less . We give away ten thousand dollars ' worth of photographs a year . Gluing Money and Earning If we gave LI Wit V us inueh money as we are asked for , we would be writing begging letters ourselves in three months . The calls for money from charities of every kind and from individuals are so steady that we have to budget 10 per cent of the gross income to that end . We ca n't very well refuse a request from un honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporting world , though we may not give as much as they ask fur . The best asking , however , is done by strangers . A letter to Jack Dempsey needs no address and there is no way of dodging begging letters , though you do n't have to answer them . Most of them are phony . Lt is n't so easy to handle strangers who come to you in person for money . Yesterday , a well-dressed young fellow got to me and wanted money to go to California . Well , who does n't want to go to California ? He could n't give any good reason why he should n't take his chances with the rest of us . I gave him five dollars and told him to snap out of it . The idea that I ca n't afford not to give money to anybody who asks for it leads a caller now and then to get hard-boiled . I know what to do for that . Boxing began as a sport and has changed to a business . When 1 started out it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is first a business . As boxing has changed , so have boxers . Everything changes , and this one has been mostly for the better . Fifty years sign in January a heavyweight named Donaldson challenged John L. Sullivan for a return meeting , Sullivan having beaten him the previous fall . A few Bostonians passed the hat and raised fifty-three dollars . When Donaldson objected that this was n't enough . Sullivan added twenty-five dollars of his own , then took Donaldson and the seventy-eight dollars in ten rounds . Fifteen years ago when I began , the old-timers were shaking their heads and contrasting those winner-take-all days and seventy-eight-dollar purses with the **36;0;TOOLONG plus picture rights , hung up by Tex Rickard for JelTri . es and Johnson and the seventy-one thousand live hundred dollars he put up for Willard and Moran in Tunney and I were to divide a purse more than thirteen times larger than the bigger of these , thanks to Rickard 's showmanship . I 'm not yet old enough to start talking about the good old days , but I notice that boxers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprenticeship . For example , there were no no-decision contests then , and ten rounds was just a warm-up . The purses were split , so much to the winner , so much to the loser , usually sixty-forty , and there were side bets by the principals , now prohibited by law . Nowadays , the eon traets read so much win , lose , draw or no decision . There is n't the same inducement to win , and both boxers may be fighting again a few night-la ter . The other night I refereed a ten-round bout at Newark . The loser had trained just three days . Be won the first two rounds by a wide margin , then blew up . He simply was n't in condition . We used to take the job more seriously . We had to . Painless Pugilist There is n't a mark on my hands today .

A blow might numb me , knock me dizzy , or even out , but I had no feeling of pain . A fog set tied down over me and when it lifted I coultio'l remember just what had happened . If you doubt this , ask another experienced professional boxer . Most of them will agree with me , I think . A boxer usually will do what his manager tells him to do , so the man-agers are more to blame . It takes four years to make it first-class lighter out of good material and he must be nursed along carefully . Two or three defeats in a row will break any boy 's spirit , and ruin him . When I was in the East in 1017 under Juhn Heisler 's manage-ment , I broke with Heisler because he ( Continued on Page 109 ) ( Conitnued resin Page 105 ) insisted on matching me out of my class against such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who were too strong . too heavy and too experienced for me and stayed away from them until I could grow up to their size . More managers used to be willing to build a boy up slowly for the long haul , gambling on a championship if they were patient . Now too many will sacrifice any youngster for a quirk profit , matching him out of his class , figuring that there are plenty more where he came from . There are thousands of youngsters in this country who could be shaped into professionals who could earn ten thousand dollars and up a year for a few years . I see hundreds of them myself . All they need is determination , clean living and a good manager . There is n't so much difference physically between normal , healthy boys . A long neck ca n't be protected . A long body with short legs disqualifies because the gear ratio is wrong . But in general . any average boy has the makings . They say championship boxing is an art , not a trade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound boy can be trained to be a fair-to-good performer , but to make a champion the boy must have unusual natural gifts- . I seem to remember that Gene Tunney was a champion , and Tunney was what is called a " build-up . " I doubt that he had much but determination to begin with . Bobby Jones probably is the most perfect machine any sport ever has known , yet he started golf with natural handicaps that would have stopped ninety-nine out of a hundred . When a Boxer Does His Thinking Boys come to me every day for advice . The advice they get is that if they like to box and are ambitious enough to work their hardest , they may never be champions , but they ought to make their mark . You can do well anything you like to do . Muscles are entirely a matter of training . Coiirdination of mind and muscles is the great trick . The younger they learn this , the easier . Children , as soon as they can walk well , can easily be taught timing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their right and left equally , to block and to imitate the style of any boxer . what you 've got to buy to make them possible from the point of view of servants and a smooth-running house . These rooms have been built in cold , sunless basements in practically every London house , and are so cheerless that the want ads nowadays in the Times , to entice cooks and butlers , hold out the plum " no basement " wherever possible . You will find , in the first place , that there is no laundry in any of these basements , or any place except the bathtub to wash out anything . Your fine linen and bath mats go together to the steam laundry along with your best underwear and the maids ' aprons . You will search in vain in the classified ads for domestic servants for anything under the L 's except those baffling anomalies , " lady cook , " or " lady nurse " ; for laundresses do not function as such except in large country houses where laundries have been deliberately planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a request for a Before a boxer begins to fight in earnest , this coordination ought to be instinctive . A good boxer does n't really think in the ring , If he has to stop and think , it is too late . He does his thinking before he gets in the ring . Once the gong has struck , he must do the right thing automatically . If a blow dazes him , his instincts carry on . When I was fighting I never saw the crowds , did n't realize most of the time that the referee was in the ring with us . All I really saw were my opponent 's eyes . Offensive ring strategy is largely a matter of maneuvering , the other fellow into a position from which you can deliver a stunning or knockout punch . You do this automatically , too . Like a chess expert , you should know all the moves by heart in advance and always see several plays ahead . Even as a beginner I made it my business to study other boxers ' styles . particularly those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done well ahead of time , for once is match is made , neither party will box in the presence of the other . I planned ways of taking advantage of their weaknesses , and tried these plans out on my spurring partners and the sand bag . Size in a heavyweight means nothing itself . When is boxer weighs Olt() hundred and seventy-five pounds he can hit hard enough , if he is any good , to knock out a man weighing three hundred pounds . But ever since the game broke out in a rash of White Hopes when Jack Johnson was champion , there has been an idea that an eighteen collar and size-twelve shoes are what managers dream about . A big fellow twenty-two years old came to me recently . His friends had told him that he was is natural . I asked questions and told him to shadow box a moment . He already was muscle-bound , did n't know the A B C 's of boxing , was not even interested .
