Last week organized labor in the U. S. suddenly massed in a concerted attack on a major Administration enactment . Conservative A. F. of L. , liberal C. I. O. , radical Workers Alliance all rose up in arms against the 13O-hour provision of the new Relief act . They explained it was a strike against Congress , a belated lobby against a new law , but the fact remained that the 130-hour rule was written into the act at the express request of President Roosevelt 's new WPAdministrator , Colonel Francis Clark ( " Pink " ) Harrington . And Franklin Roosevelt was on record , since as early as 1935 , as opposing the " prevailing wage " provision demanded ( and heretofore obtained ) by union labor . In signing the new Relief Act , Franklin Roosevelt noted other " hardships " worked by it ( TIME , July 10 ) , but he passed the 130-hour proviso without comment . Evidently he and his Janizariat had not realized what a cannon-cracker it would be . <P> WPA needed something to restore its respectability after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 130-hour provision , to make high-priced reliefers do more work for their money ( though still not work anywhere near the legal maximum of 44 hours a week for privately employed workers ) , earned the approval of private employers . It promised to promote efficiency in WPA . That it now produced a fierce racket from all three big political wings of Labor was intensely embarrassing . It put Franklin Roosevelt , already bedeviled by an Isolationist bloc in the Senate , on a new and unexpected hotspot . <P> &gt; By four votes ( 43-to-39 ) in the Senate , Franklin Roosevelt won his bitter fight with Congress over control of the country 's ' money . But the end of that fight only cleared the field for a mightier one : over control of the country 's conduct in case of war overseas . As 34 diehard-isolationists massed in Senator Johnson 's lair under the Capitol rotunda to sign a manifesto , lines formed for the longest tussle of all between the 32nd President and the 76th Congress . <P> &gt; The death and obsequies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war between President and Congress . It also opened up a new political vista . Mentioned to fill the Navy vacancy , or the No. 2 job there after moving up Acting Secretary Charles Edison , was Missouri 's Governor Lloyd Crow Stark , newly famed for smacking down villainous Boss Tom Pendergast of Kansas City ( TIME , April 17 , et seq . ) . Mr. Stark , an Annapolis graduate , is now high on the White House 's list of 1940 prospects . Calling him for duty at Washington would be one way of building him up nationally . Last week , with a band and a trainload of Missourians , Governor Stark set off on a Western tour which will make him better known .
