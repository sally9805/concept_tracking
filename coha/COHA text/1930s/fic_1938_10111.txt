War was not fought between General Grant and GeneralLee , but between Private Fred Cornplow of Massachusettsand Private Ed Cornplow of Alabama ; and a few years later it was they who created bribery and railroads and gave all their loot to science . From Fred Cornplow 's family , between B.C. 1937 and A.D. 1937 , there came , despite an occasional aristocraticByron or an infrequent proletarian John Bunyan , nearly all the medical researchers , the discoverers of better varieties of wheat , the poets , the builders , the singers , the captains of great ships . Sometimes his name has been pronounced Babbitt ; sometimes it has been called Ben Franklin ; and once , if Eugene O'Neill may be trusted , he went by the style of Marco Polo and brought hack from civilized China to barbaric Europe the sound of camel bells , and the silken tents , scented with sandalwood , which have overshadowed the continentever since . Ile is the eternal bourgeois , the bourjoyce , the burgher , the Middle Class , whom the Bolsheviks hate and imitate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the population worth considering in France and Germany and these United States . He is Fred Cornplow ; and when he changes his mind , that crisis is weightier than Waterloo or Thermopylae . No , Fred decided , he could n't either retire or take a year 's vacation . Howard , confound him , was right ; just now , he had to stay by the ship . But he certainly would n't drudge on for another ten or fifteen years . He would retire in five years from now , exactly ; he hadp101made up his mind , and doggone , let anybody try to change it ! And meantime he would gorgeously " get in shape . " He felt absurd in doing it , but Fred was in training for adventure . He stopped smoking before breakfast ; he occasionally walked to the office ; and once or twice a week , with intense distress and a feeling of being silly , he wabbled dumbbells in the Elks ' gymnasium or joined in the calisthenics of a squad of bankers and brokers and superintendents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kickers resembled a mixed group of turkeys and hippopotami enacting an Andalusian flower song . But he persisted . He had worked out for himself a principle : " You 'll never make any change in your life that you have n't already begun . " A fortnight after the beginning of Fred 's madness , Howard appeared in the office and croaked , " Of course all those jokes you pulled at your birthday party about retiring  --  I know you 're too responsible to do anything like that . " " Well , you know , son  --  fellow sometimes feels like kicking the dashboard . " " Sure . I did n't take you seriously . " " No ? Well -- Gosh it 's hot for May . " Indeed , Fred was wiping his forehead . " Sure is . Yessir , actually hot ! " " Guess I 'll drop in at Swazey &; Lindbeck 's , this noon , and pick me out a summer suit . "  | " No , no . " Howard was pretty firm . " They 'll sting you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? " " I know it . And I do n't want you to stop carrying a silk muffler yet . Pretty fickle weather . " " Yuh , I suppose Though I bet your mother is sweating to death , this morning , laying out her sweet peas . " " And that 's another thing . I 've told Mother and I 've told her , but I just ca n't get her to listen to me . It 's all foolishness , her trying to grow sweet peas . Why do n't she put in some good sturdy rosebushes that do n't need so much attention ? But think she 'd pay any attention to me ? Oh no ! " When Howard was gone , to drive back to Truxon College at a conservative sixty miles an hour , Fred mused , " So if the young man should make good , and not always lean on me , fifteen years from now he 'd be tying up Hazel and me by the fireplace and telling us when to breathe . Nothing doing ! He travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing , of course , he has Hazel with him , you understand . "  | NO DOUBT Sara and Eugene Silga did n't deserve any particular credit for it . Their office was one stingy room on the third floor of the Stiggis Building , between a photographer of riotous babies and the agency for a platinum mine . They had nothing but two kitchen tables , four kitchen chairs , a wire basket filled with bills , a pile of rival radical magazines which damned one another for lukewarmness in revolution , one window  --  dirty , and a telephone  --  in arrears , but no doubt they enjoyed it more than a plush and walnut office with respectful attendants . You can feel more heroic in shirt sleeves than in ermine . In this primitive office of the Sachem Falls Cell of the Workers ' International Cohesion , and of Protest &; Progress , Sara was luxuriously misreading proof on the forthcoming first number , while Gene sputtered on the telephone : " Why , certainly , comrade , we 'll provide the speakers . ... Good ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gorillas seven times . . . . Sure , all the decorations ;  |p104I  've got a four-by-seven-foot poster of Lenin . . . . No . Fifty per cent of the gate . . . . No , wo n't touch it for less . . . . All right , you talk to ' em and give me a ring . " Gene glanced at her with those eyes , daring and amused , that seemed to understand her every foolishnessand desire . She did n't care , resolved Sara ; she would marry Gene even if they had to live in a one-room flat and she do the cooking . Oh yes ; that was what she had been trying to remember : she must learn to cook . She chucked the proofs and swam shyly toward him . She panted as he smiled at her with his especial smile of friendliness , but what he said was : " Sara l " " Yes , Gene ! " " I , uh You know these Channing Praggs  --  the glass manufacturer ? Think you could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she calls it , for me ? I 'll spiel on birth control in Russia and pass the hat . Is n't it funny , darling ! " He patted her hand , which was clenching the edge of his table-desk . " Nobody comes through with funds for the revolution like the wives of millionaires , even after we 've openly announced we intend to overthrow the Democratic State and institute a real , honest-to-God dictatorship of the rednecks like me . How come ? You 're a capitalist , darling . Why do you guys in the ruling class let us get away with it ? " " I do n't think Mr Frederick W. Cornplow is as keen on our getting away with it as I 'd like to see . We 'll have to work on him a lot yet , dear . "  |p105Their  laughter was a gust that blew away all such featherbrains as Fred . She was certain that Gene was going to show a little more affection now than just the patting of hands which had been his only gesture , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frieda Kitz clumped into the office . Frieda earned her living in a wallpaper warehouse ; she was treasurer of the Coheeze ; she never laughed except for a triumphant snort at the thought of a firing squad 's converting the Praggs and Cornplows ; and though she had a tranquil broad-browed loveliness , she wore her hair tight and never dressed in anything but stiff corduroy suits and flat low shoes . Sara looked at Frieda with hatred  --  she at Sara with contempt  --  while Gene greeted Frieda all too quietly , too understandingly , " Good morning , comrade . " Sara felt that she had been sent back to the kitchen . She had been snubbed by amateur snobs like Mrs ChanningPragg ; not till now had she been snubbed by an expertlike Comrade Kitz . She crept to her desk and the suddenly hateful proofs . Gene and the Comrade did not seem to think that she was important enough to hide their secrets from her as they talked softly at his desk of orders from the great lords of communism in New York . Sara was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had blunderedinto one of her mother 's tiny coffee parties and heard those shocking bores , the Grown-up Ladies , confiding , " Oh , they say he drinks , " and " In October , she told me . " She was sickened by the easy intimacy with whichp106Gene and Frieda shook hands at parting , needing to say nothing beyond a soft , revealing , " So long , comrade . " But she made no comment on Frieda , as Gene again pulled toward him the telephone on which , all day long , he placidly forwarded his plans to smash the American government . She buckled to work . She had not learned until now that most banal , most ancient , most weighty truth , that there is refuge in work . Sara was magnificently playing the role of new broom . She was assistant secretary of the Coheeze , and managing editor ( the other editors were Eugene Silga ) as well as two-finger stenographer and advertising solicitorof Protest &; Progress . She wrote the minor editorials , with happy thought of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt herself a combination of Queen Marie , Emma Goldman , Lady Astor , Virginia Woolf and Charlotte Corday . It was a good job , this profession of being not merely allowed but encouraged to clout every head that rose above the mob , and of actually being paid for doing it  --  provided she went out and raised funds for the payment . Into the office exploded their collaborators , Howard Cornplow and Guy Staybridge , with the uncollaborative , the hopelessly bourgeois Annabel tagging after them . " Gene ! Gene ! I 've got a poem for you ! Wrote it in biology class ! " crowed Guy . " This ' 11 stir up the fakers in Washington . Listen : " Here is a dime , ' the President said , If you 'll vote for me twice and bow your head.  |p107Red  roses rioting North and South  --  Think of them , buddy , and shut your mouth . Go buy you a suit of clothes , ' he said , But careful , buddy , the coat ai n't red ! ' " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that ease Sara loved him . He dropped the poem into the pasteboardbox which , Sara knew , held the manuscripts he had accepted and would never publish . He gushed , " Hope you 've been able to raise a little dough , Guy . Kind of a crisis with the T. &; P. ' If our friends will help us to get through this month " Yeh , I got fifteen dollars from Dr Gomber , the professorof drama  --  he sympathizes with communism  --  he 's got plenty money  --  his father owns in on the Piping Rock Explosives Corporation . " Guy handed over a wrinkled ten-dollar bill and a five . These did not go into any pasteboard box , but into Gene 's vest pocket , and Gene turned on Howard with an affectionate , " How about you , old man ? " Howard was looking vaguely at the window . " You ought to have more air in here , Gene . If I had time I could fix it so you 'd have more air in here , Gene . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you manage to raise any funds ? " " Oh , I was going to , but I 've been awful busy . " " Sure , but the world revolution has to be pretty busy , too , Howard . " " Well now , I 'll tell you how I feel about that , Gene . I ca n't say I 'm entirely sold on communism . " Howard looked as handsome as Pike 's Peak at sunset and asp108dumb . " With my scientific training , Gene , you got to show me the data  --  show me the data ; the thing is --  " The data , " chirped Annabel , sitting on a pile of " Proletarian Art . " Howard faced her crossly . " Well , what about it ? Do n't you think you got ta have the data , Bell ? " " Sure . Data is the goods . " " You 're so frivolous all the time ! You got no idea the risks I take , in a conservative dump like Truxon , coming right out for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " I 'm with you , beautiful , just the same as your mother will be with your father , no matter how much she may kick beforehand , if he ever decides to go and do something sweet and crazy . " Sara and I loward swapped glances of surprise . It had not occurred to them that anybody , certainly not a flippant young woman , certainly not a superior Staybridge , could speak of their matter-of-fact parents with enthusiastic affection . " Howard ! " Sara demanded . " Tell me something more about rockets for aerial power . Just exactly how do they work , mechanically ? " " Rockets ? " " Good heavens , do n't you remember that the otherday you were making a fortune out of them ? Comethrough now ; do n't hold out all this priceless information on your comrade and sister , stupid . How do therockets work ? I 've got to write something about ' em . " Annabel was helpful : " The aviator wears an operap109hat with the rockets in ' em , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . " " Can it ! " said Howard . " Do n't be an idiot , " said Sara . " Darling ! " said Gene . " Check , " said Annabel . " Now rockets , " said Howard , " these rockets  --  well , if you want a technical explanation , they 're affixed to the , I think it 's the rear of the fuselage , I think it 's the fuselage , and  --  well , they go off , and the sum of the reaction is equal to the reaction , I mean to the action , and there you are , Sara , ca n't you see ? If you 'd only studied physics , instead of all this literature and stuff ! " " My beautiful , " yearned Annabel . Winnie Weston Blear 's Tea Room was to Sachem Falls a combination of all the Greenwich Village restaurantsthat begin with Ye and all the Broadway restaurantsin which legitimate theatrical producers have a farewell drink before catching the train for Hollywood . Mrs Blear 's establishment had caviare once or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the head waitress , and English muffins were practically obligatory . Here exhibited themselves the featured players of the Spreadeagle Little Theater , all the violin teachers in town , and the local literary celebrity  --  the dramatic critic on the Evening Tidings , who had written a book on his travels in New Zealand . Guy took all of the " P. &; P. " conspirators , except Gene , who had a rendezvous with the telephone , over to Mrs Blear 's and went cosmopolitan on them . Hisp110father , the bleak Mr Putnam Staybridge , had once sufferedGuy 's presence for two weeks in London and one in Paris , and Guy explained now , to the untraveled Howard and Sara and Annabel , how sophisticated were cream cheese with bar le due , avocado soaked with curacao , and Stilton with port  --  while the nearest they came to these elegances was cinnamon toast with chilly tea . Annabel paid attention to her brother not with her ears but with her memory . hor years she had listened to her father and Guy being airy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fondly on a Howard who confessed that he knew no more about Stilton ( which he seemed to regard as some variety of sponge cake ) than a rabbit . Howard warmed handsomely to her stilly gaze , and suddenly , to the disgust of those hard-boiled communist warriors , Sara and Guy , he demanded of Annabel : " Arc you crazy about me ? " " Absolutely . " " How crazy ? " " Catatonics , catelepsies and cataclysms . " Sara barked , " I 'm going to the office . " " And me , " said Guy . " When do you publish my poem ? "  | WHILE FRED , With Hazel on the arm of his chair , was reading the first copy of Protest &; Progress , Sara pretended to be lost in the Daily Worker , and over it she watched them with what she hoped was cynical amusement . On the " P. &; P. " cover , in a technique familiar to Fred from the high-school papers his children had once brought home , was a caricature labeled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grossly fat man drinkingchampagne from a magnum . That was fairly easy for Hazel to understand , but she balked at two other caricatures , " Workers Unite ! " and " The Newest Deal . " In the first , " Labor " was revealed as an agonized dwarf lashed by a diabolic monster named " Capital , " but in the second , Labor was a young and singing giant who laughed at a wizened Capital held in the palm of his brawny hand : a hand worthy of a structural steel worker or even of Litvinoff . Hazel worried , " Look , Fred , I do n't get that . If Labor is such a shrimp one place and gets all beat upp112by Capital , how come he can squeeze Capital so , two pages further on ? " " Hush , Hazel . That shows how fast the Coheeze is working . Do n't be bourjoyce . " Sara sniffed . The bourjoyces studied , then , the " P. &; P. 's " news from Russia . With only nineteen years since the revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , playgroundsand a twelve-story hotel . " Hm . Pretty good . Still , that 's the same period as from 1865 to 1884 , when America built up the entire West , after having had the stuffin 's knocked out of her in the Civil War , " said Fred . To his delight , that did draw Sara . " Entirely different , " she proclaimed . " How ? " said Fred . " Any numberof ways , " said Sara . Ile was not so well pleased when he read Eugene Silga 's interview with the executive vice-president of the Colonial Motor Car Company , which presented the executive as a languider , pouchier and more mulish versionof George III , ignorant alike of motor engineering and of the living conditions of the workers . This demon Fred had met in Detroit ; he knew that he was the son of a blacksmith , an engineer who was equally interested in rear-end motors , in mountain climbing and in hospitals . " We are not amused , " felt Fred . " Huh . Oh , Hazel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kamerkinks about Sunday  --  c'm on , jus ' second , " he blurted . As Hazel opened her mouth , he pinched her arm in caution , and she followed him intop113the hall . He led her not to the telephone but to the coat closet . " Eh ? " she wondered . " Hush . Take a swig of this . Maybe it ' 11 get us through the intelligence test without our kicking Sara . " He had taken from the inside pocket of an aged raincoata bottle of gin ; he gargled at it and handed it over . " Oh , so that 's where you keep it ! No . I ca n't drink the beastly stuff .... Straight ? I never heard  --  I never heard of My , that has got a kick . . . . I do feel better 1 " They read through the editorials , two of which be-gan : So-called modern ingenuity is producing a wealth of mechanicalgadgets which , if they were conceived of as serving the Proletariatand as vehicles for sound Propaganda , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily transportedand opening out into four- or five-room houses , television , and the probable future of propulsion of airships by rockets , so that one could go from New York State to Moscow in six or eight hours , should institute a new civilization , but to the dull , greedy , cruel and unimaginative mind of the American " business man " they are nothing but future sources of profit wherewith he can the better contribute to the funds of the Fascist armies threatening Russia . And : A sardonically amusing revelation of the mind of the American " business man " is found in the fact that as soon as he can pile up the swag , he betrays his real lack of interest in his calling by hoping to retire . Naturally ! He has none of the deep inner satis/faction felt by Soviet experts in building permanently and for the people . " Now who do you suppose could have written those two gems ? " said Fred . " Sara 1 " Coolly : " Yes ? " " I 've been looking at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got a new title for it ; same alliteration : Prig and Prattle . ' " " Arc you being humorous , Father ? " " Not very . When you get a real communist fanatic that 's as het up as a prohibition reformer or a censorshipmaniac , and let him also use machine guns and firing squads the way he wants to , maybe it sounds humorous , but I do n't suppose it is. "  |p115HER  MOTHER had gone to bed ; her father , Sara guessed , with just a little uneasiness , had shown unusual powers of keeping his mouth shut and , without any lecture on the subject , had made it clear that he would not contribute to the Coheeze . But that was only part of her troubles , and she said to him coaxingly : " Sometimes you think I do n't appreciate how hard you work , Father , but I do . I 've been learning about real work . Not only at the Coheeze I do n't suppose you care to talk much about that . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I 'm going to enter the club tennis tournament this summer ? " " That sounds better . " " And I 'm afraid I 'll have to contribute to the courts fund , and my allowance is so shamefully over-drawn --  " Ten dollars be enough ? . . . No ? . . . Fifteen ? . . . No ? Well , twenty-five , and that 's my limit ! " " Oh , I suppose we can get away with that " gone and got myself mixed up with the amateur summer theater that the Spreadeagle Little Theater is sponsoring , and they 've elected me chairman of the Box Office , Seats , and Ushering Committee  --  of course it is quite an honor , with Mrs Channing Pragg and Putnam Staybridge ( and how he ever came to have a tacky daughter like Annabel I do n't know ; wait ; do n't shoot ; if Howardand you say she 's pretty , I suppose she must be )  --  and with them on the hoard of directors , it 's quite a social honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raise a fifty- or seventy-five-dollar subscription , somehow or other " And Fred fired , after keeping his powder so dry so long : " 1 know I 'm just a clodhopper , that 's all , nothing but a clodhopper , just a clown , that 's all , nothing but a dumb bunny , but I 'll be everlastingly doggoned if I can understand how you can hook up your doggoned Young Men 's Anarchist Association with guzzling tea with Sister Pragg and kissing the doggone snobs in the tennis association " " Yes ? Perhaps I might just happen to convert them to socialism . " " And perhaps you might just happen to not do anythingof the kind .

" At the end of that scene , as he described it to Hazel in their bathroom , " She went and got hurt , and then she walked out on me . Oh , I do n't want to be mean , but I do n't like to see her  --  yes , or see me  --  falling for people that just use her for what they can get out of her , " he worried , while Hazel , smoothing his cheek , was worried along with him . He was the more dependent upon the security of home because he was too busy and doing too well . The Triumph and Houndtooth were prospering ; the Duplex Trailer was a sensation ; and he had to bounce all over his district , leasing out Duplex rights to subagents , and thus getting rid , wherever he could , of responsibility . That he also got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell his family . He said nothing about retiring ; he did not think about it very clearly ; but he kept up his absurdly grave " training " ; and he was giving Paul Popple more experience in accounting and sales . " ' Fanything ever happened to me , ought to be somebody else could kind of take charge  --  just temporarily , " he said to Paul . In one bright idea he had a regrettable failure . Among the less desirable features of the Triumphp118shop , along with rats , high insurance rates and a smell of sewer gas , was the continued presence of his nearcousins , Cal and Mac Tillery . Fred had , briefly , been too much of a coward to fire them and to risk receiving the hurt letter which their sire , Cousin Enos , would inevitablywrite . He had tried them at cleaning cars , until too many owners complained of wet upholstery and of running boards abloom with soaked cigarette butts ; he had tried them at selling gasoline , until he noticed that with each gallon they donated five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll say it 's hot . Oh boy , is it hot today  --  say , it was hot when I woke up this morning  --  oh boy , was it hot ! " Painting did not seem suited to the particular talents of Cal and Mac ; they broke spray guns and made the car bodies contrasts of gummy spots with patches entirely bare . At last Fred had put them to packing and toting boxes in the supply department , which they did fairly well , except when they dropped the boxes , lost them or used them as targetsfor tobacco juice . In whatever job they might be , they told all colleaguesand all customers , " We 're Fred Cornplow 's own cousins . I ie 's learned how to get away with it , but say , is that guy a hick ! Oh boy ! " Fred begged of them , tenderly , " Boys , now summer 's coming , do n't you suppose your dad will need you on his farm ? " " His what ? " " His farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh . That . Oh , Dad never got there . He run into a cousin of Ma 's , on the way , that 's got a wild animal farm , and he and Ma and the kids are staying there to help train the tigers . " " Well , well , Cal ! That 's fine , Mac ! That must be mighty interesting ! Do n't you want to join him ? I hear tigers make fine pets . I 'd be glad to pay your railroad fares . " " Naw . Dad wrote me a postcard ; he said Cousin Albertwas an awful tightwad and gives ' em rotten grub . He got so sore he prett ' near left Cousin Albert flat . No , we like it all right here , Fred . ' We 'll stick by you . " By Sara , Fred sent word to Gene Silga that if he could use one or two fine young men , just the sort of real proletarians to whom Gene wished to hand the control of the American government , Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coheeze . Eugene sent back jeering word : " The Soviets and their fellow travelers do n't want shiftless bums any more than the capitalists do ; in fact , not being sentimentallike the soppy American capitalists , the Bolsheviksgive slackers a choice between working and losing citizenship . " It was at that moment that Fred almost joined the communists . And he felt thus for a second time when Howard dragged in his playful friend , Ben Bogey , whose slogan was " Homes that are nice at lowest price . "  |p122ing  to Sara ; he patted it back on again with a gesture like a vaudeville hoofer 's ; he sat on the edge of Sara 's table and went into action : " The home I 'm thinking of just now is n't for you folks personally . You can kid me , but I 'm sure you 've got cozy little hideaways of your own .

" Not for fifteen minutes did Gene make a real effort to get rid of Ben Bogey , for like all people who work in offices , including magazine offices , publishers ' offices and the clangorous offices of latter-day authors , with their lecture and radio and cinema departments , Gene was pleased by anything like an excuse to stop telephoning .

" I 'm not a communist , you understand , Mr Bogey ; I was just in there because I 've got a sister works there . Say , I 've got a swell idea for a new kind of suburb . " " Yeah ? " cautiously .

" Annabel was small and forlorn , at the end of a mahoganycouch , pride of the Staybridge Mansion . She peeped at the telephone out in the hall . By now , she thought , the instrument must be so well trained that she would have but to pick up the receiver to be connected with Truxon College . Why , she thought , did she ever call him up ? Howard never said anything on the telephone but " Ullo , ullo , ullo " in what he considered an English accent . But he was so cheerful and knowable , in contrast to her culturedParent , whose level voice was always a veil , soaked in ice water , between them . Forlorn and very small . Actually , Annabel was as tall as her father , who sat in elegant flowing lines at the other end of the drawing room . But so erect was his pride and self-satisfaction that , beside her , he seemed like an obelisk . He did not pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything she did , and she became jerky . She looked away from the telephone . She rose and paced toward the fireplace , airily swinging her hands , trying to think of any reason why she should go to the fireplace . She moved the brass Buddha on the mantelpiece two inches to the right ; she felt her father 's condemnatoryglance scorching her back , and hastily she moved Buddha back again . With a fine fingertip , she smoothed the cool glossy cover of a garden magazine  --  and peeped at the telephone.  |p127Her  fingers wandered through the poems of Yeats ; the old edition , with the cross and the mystic rose and falling leaves upon the cover , which her father had brought home from London thirty years ago and which , after her mother 's death , he had been wont to read to her until suddenly she had awakened to the charm of the lines , at which he immediately became impatient of them , said they were sentimental , for milk-sick girls , and threw the book on the floor . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half sneering at her now as she read again : " . . . the land of faery Where nobody gets old and godly and grave , Where nobody gets old and crafty and wise , Where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue ; And she is still there , busied with a dance , Deep in the dewy shadow of a wood , Or where stars walk upon a mountain-top . " Again she looked toward the telephone , and he spoke suavely , like a man superior to all emotion : " It would be obvious , would n't it , Ann , that you are expecting a telephone call from this bloated young bruiser , Cornplow , this study in the mind of primitive man , whom you have been seeing lately ? " " He is n't bloated . But I am expecting him to phone " " The word is telephone . ' " "  --  or to drop in . " " Drop into what ? The speech of youth today is veryp128picturesque . It lacks only one thing that speech normally should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop , stop , stop , stop ! Dear God , I get so sick of your making spider webs of words that choke me ! Howard is simple ! That 's one reason I like him ! He 's like daylight and fresh air , and this place is like a dungeon ! " " I trust you like his family , also  --  they are certainly on the simple , fresh-airish side . " " I do ! Especially his father . There 's such nice wiggly lines beside his eyes , where he laughs . And you dare to patronize him ! Oh , I do hate you ! " " Are you quite sure , my dear Ann ? I suspect that , at least , my superciliousness will keep you from making - a fool of yourself " And then , astonishingly , Howard was ringing the doorbell . After her father 's wry , dark , feline teasing , the young man seemed to Annabel like a jolly St Bernard . She clasped his solid chunk of a hand and towed him into the drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moods . IIe had already dropped the venom and honey , the purr of a cat with a mouse , and he barked like a terrier : " Good evening , Howard . I daresay you would agree that the weather is warm . " " Uh " I see that we are in accord about the weather . " " Uh " But there is , perhaps , a weightier topic . I don'tp129know whether you have the intelligence to perceive it , but it looks to me as though you either had grossly improperintentions , as they call ' em , toward my daughter , or else you are young idiot enough to think that you could marry her . Which , eh ? Which ? " " W-why , I 'll tell you , Mr Staybridge " Do n't stammer ! " " Well , golly , springing things like that so suddenly  --  hard for fellow to answer , right off the bat " Light fingers on his arm , Annabel had guided Howardto a stiff Colonial settee , and she perched beside him , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Course , maybe I suppose I ought to finish college before I think about getting married , sir , but I certainlyam crazy about Bell , and the minute I get out , I hope to land a good job and be able to support her . " " It is your notion , then , that all Miss Annabel needs is to be provided with food and lodging ? She seems to me to be quite adequately cared for already . Has it occurred to you that it would also be necessary , for you to learn her language ; the language I 've reared her to speak ? " " Her language ? " " Quite ! If you see this as in a glass , darkly , Miss Annabel might be willing to explain . " Mr Staybridge did not , as usual , embarrass them by snatching up his toys and going home ; he embarrassed them more by sitting in easy indifference , reading Baron Corvo . If in the chill of that dry ice Annabel and Howardwere too congealed for speech , their touching handsp130were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to a stiff white bench beside a stiff red plot of roses . June , moon , tune  --  roses red and joybells soon ; it should all have been a comedy of boy meets girl ; but actually the young people were shaken with fear of Putnam Staybridge 's contempt , fear of a world where the commonplaces of jobs and rent and food had become as difficult as winning an empire ; and most of all , fear of their own overwhelming and illogical love , releasednow by Putnam 's jibes . Annabel dropped her protective street-corner flipness , all the " O.K.s " and " Swells " she had adopted equally from shopgirls and from the elegant Junior Leaguers . Howard was frightened out of his heavy humor . With his arm desperate about her shoulder , he could feel her tremble , her arm and shoulder tremble , as though every muscle were a shaken cord , and he was trembling himself as he struggled : " G-golly , I g-guess we got to do something about it . I ca n't stand being away from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and throwing books around , and even drinking gin , and I 'm beginning to think gin is awfully bad for your digestion , and the bums , they come busting into my room any hour , day or night , in those dirty ole sweaters and gray pants , and I want to throw ' em out  --  honest , Bell , I guess maybe I 'm kind of crazy , but I can see you there standing in the dormitory hall , in a white dress , like a white flower the wind has blown there , and But gosh , I wonder if I 'm very intelligent ?

We 'll be married before this week is up I " " But do n't they expel students that marry , at Truxon ? " " Um-huh . " " But do n't you think you have to finish college ? " " We ca n't go on pretending to be a couple of monks . " " No . Perhaps not . " " I 'll get a job right away . Dad bellyaches about it , but I can depend on him to find " " No ! Howard ! We must n't depend on anybody ! And besides !

" " You know : my father  --  sometimes he 's pretty bright , or else he knows what books to steal from  --  he was saying that there is n't any government ; there 's nothing but a lot of people that are the government only they do n't know it . " " Maybe , but a fellow 's own parents I never asked to be born . " " I doubt if anybody invited you to , either ! No . If Father Fred gets sick of nursing us , I wo n't blame him .

But before we start , there 's a few things we 'll have to have , and I 'm busted , just this minute , so Brother Cornplow will have to come through . We 'll need a new radio  --  I have n't anything but my little portable  --  and the one in the car , of course  --  but that 's a cinch ; I 'd be perfectly satisfied with a radio that did n't cost over fifty bucks .

"  | " My child , my child ! Good-by , Mr Yeats ! Good-by , dove-gray edge of the sea and stormy sunset on doomed ships ! " Annabel put on again her mask of country-club vulgarity . " What a job I went and picked out for myself ! " She kissed him on the lips . " Call me ten tomorrow morning , when That One is off to his den , " and she fled into the gloomy house , while he wailed , " But wait  --  wait  --  just minute Aw , Bell , please I 'll be doggoned ! "  | TThREEP.M . . A June day . Office of the Triumph Motor Agency , also the Duplex Trailer , the Nation 's Movable Home . Mr Putnam Staybridge calling on Mr Frederick William Cornplow . " How d ' you do , Mr Staybridge ! What can I do for you today ? Can I have one of the salesmen show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you mind if I sit down ? " " Why , no . " " Cornplow , I have ventured on a course , somewhat rare in these complex days  --  I 'm quite old-fashioned , you see  --  of coming to you and speaking directly . Are you are aware that your son and my daughter , mere children both of them , and perhaps neither of them very wise , apparently think they are in love ? " Fred was as angry at the smooth and supercilious tone as he had ever been in his life . Sitting behind his desk , he pressed his fingertips together till his knuckles felt as though they were breaking , but never in his life had he sounded more civil :  | " I 've noticed something of the kind , Mr  --  uh  --  yes , I have noticed it , Staybridge . " " You realize that it would be entirely unsuitable for Miss Annabel to marry your son . " " Possibly . " Mr Staybridge waited for wrath , but had to carry on the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " " Not unless he 's been holding out on me ! " " Nor prospects ? " " He tells me he may play on the college team , next fall . " " I 'm being serious , Cornplow . " Fred grunted . " And I think that in other respects they are n't exactly mated , " said Putnam . " Such as ? " " Oh , need we go into details , my dear fellow ? " Fred tramped the floor for almost a quarter of a minute before he was able to answer with suavity : " Want me to tell you what you 're trying to say , Staybridge ? No . I do n't suppose you do . But I 'll be doggoned if I 'm not going to . The idea is that you come from an aristocratic family , and me and the boy from a bunch of plain farmers and blacksmiths . That 's the bunk . If it were true , which it does n't happen tobe --  " Are n't you rather assuming --  "  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because there 's about six hard-up school teachers or government clerks among the Staybridge gang to one rich one  | " If you please ! " "  --  but what of it ? We 're dealing with today . You 're the kind of snob , Putnam , that thinks a manufacturer is socially ' way ahead of a wholesaler , and a wholesaler has got it all over a retailer , God knows why , and --  And it happens that you are n't even a strictly kosher manufacturer  --  you own in pretty heavily , as a sleepingpartner , on the Conqueror Company , which is engaged in peddling cars , same as I am . Oh , Putnam , how could you , my boy ! " Fred had seated himself again , very red ; the pearlpalePutnam had risen , even redder , and was shrieking , " There happens also to be a question of breeding and manners ! " Quite gallantly Putnam took the risk of turning his back to Fred the Terrier and walking out . Fred was brooding , " And now , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and make those doggoned young idiots go and get married even if they doggoned do n't want to ! . . . Huh ? No , I 'm busy . Have Paul Popplc talk to him . " Later : " But the little rat was right about one thing . Annabel certainly has got better manners than my brat , and I suspect she can read and write . " Much later : " What can a parent , that is n't more ' n average bright himself , do for his children ? Maybe leave them alone ? I f I only knew ! . . . Maybe the poor , conceited little flute player loves his daughter , in his fool fashion . Wants to keep her . . . . He 's lost her . Do we always lose the people we love ; only keep thep137people that we do n't plague with loving ?

I 'd like an armistice ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there 's peace . "  |p138THE  FIRST FIREFLIES of the summer beckoned in thegarden beside the Staybridge Mansion . There was a smell of rain-wet rhododendrons , and beside the white gate a girl in a white cloak was waiting . With muted engine , the car crept through the little street of maples and apple trees , stopped with the enginethrobbing , and the horn , thrice sounded , was only a whimpering murmur . Annabel rustled through the gate . The right-hand front door was held open for her , and she crept into the car in silence ; in silence they slipped away . Annabel could see that Howard was driving . In the back seat were Sara , Eugene Silga and her brother , Guy . " Got the license in my pocket , " muttered Howard . She patted his arm nervously . " You 're of age , anyway , are n't you , Bell ? " said Sara , leaning forward , hands on the back of the front seat . " Just . " " Then your father could n't do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man might do . . . Howard , did you see your father ? " " Yes . But I did n't say anything about the marriage . Neither did he . He just looked sort of funny . " " ' Marriage ! ' It sounds so solemn and scary , " said Sara . " To me it sounds like whiskers and horsehair sofas and whalebone corsets , " sniffed Gene . Annabel seemed to be talking in sleep : " Yes . I do n't believe we 're going to do it . We 're putting on an amateurplay , and afterwards , pretty soon now , Putnam S. will come back to my dressing room and say , Ann , if you had more discipline , if you did n't let the emotion govern you , you would n't be a bad actress . ' Maybe he 's right . " " Him ? Never ! " from Howard . " Was n't he right when he thought me up ? " " Yes , he did have a pretty good idea that time ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights from movie theaters . Howard drove scarily , as swiftly as he could , bounding ahead as the lights turned from red to green , till his shaken passengers nodded like Asian gods . Their escape from the stillnessbeside Putnam Staybridge 's garden enlivened them , and they became hysterical : " Do n't forget to stop at the cathedral and pick up the bish and the canon 71 " And the trench mortar " I 've arranged for a hillbilly choir and six Jugoslav maestri playing twelve pianos --  " But how can they --  " With their feet , of course , idiot " " We ca n't get the bishop . He 's playing poker down at Honest Tom 's , and I heard he picked up his skirts and chased the cop on the beat seven blocks with a bung starter " " Annabel can have a choice of a rabbi , a Mormon missionary , and a Kentucky cardinal " " That 's a bird , my good fool . " " So is he ! " " Well , all you true-blue Aryan Tories and goyim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double pinochle " " Howard , frheaven 's sake , you 're doing fifty-five ! " " Fifty-seven , " said Howard . Guy Staybridge had been looking through the back window . " Howard ! Ann ! I think there 's somebody following us . He 's been making every turn we make , and there 's darn little traffic on this Patchin route , so I can pick him out . " " The road is free , white and twenty-one , " said Howard , contentedly  --  accelerating . " The horn sounds to me like my father 's Conqueror  --  I know that horn , " said Guy . " All right . We 'll ditch him . Not that I 'm scared of him or nobody , " growled Howard and , after thinking it over thoroughly , " never ! " But he sped up , turned off on a side street so sharply that they were almost thrown from their seats , missed a station wagon , circled a block and came back on the  | " Have we lost him ? " Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's hard to figure out  --  these headlights . " " Do you mind slowing up ? " begged Annabel . " I 'd hate to have Arrived at her wedding minus seven ribs ' on my tombstone . " " Personally , I 'm scared to death , " said Gene . Guy , still taking sight through the rear window and feeling important in the role of detective on guard , said with fake calm , " I do n't think that was his horn just now . These Conquerors got a whale of a lot of power  --  more ' n your Triumph , I believe . " Annabel hooted hysterically . " What 's the matter with you ? " Howard was stolid and disapproving . " Oh , darling ! Do n't you see ? A curse on both your supply houses ! Howardeo Montague Triumph and Annabel Capulet Conqueror ! " " I do n't get that . Explain it to me afterwards , when I 'm not so busy , " said Howard . Annabel , with a small sound like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , leaned forward , chin in hand . The parsonage in Patchin , which was half suburb to Sachem and half country village , was a white box , more porch than house . Sara had imagined aloud : " The preacher will be a sweet old soul with spectacles , and his wife will be a dumpling , and they 'll both be colossal bores . They 'll kiss everybody that does n't skip fast , and tell you twop142idiots to try to stand for each other , which is plainly unreasonable . " But the minister and his wife , who came worrying out onto the porch as soon as the car hooted , were a timid , awkward pair , nearly as young as Howard and Annabel , though they possessed a pair of twins , whom they introduced as Abner and Bernice and sent protestingup to bed . They seemed more frightened about the marriage than did the brazen principals , and the pastor 's lady begged them all to have " just a bite to eat  --  just a little something  --  maybe some nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderly , but after lookingSara , Guy and Eugene over with anxiety , dismissed them as one of those accidents that just will happen . The scanty living room could not have been changed much since 189o . It still displayed a parlor organ and a brocade table-cover with ball fringes . On hanging shelves were the little pastor 's books , each volume painstakingly covered with oilcloth . " This is n't a wedding ! Did n't I say it was just a play ! " Annabel whispered to Howard , as they lined up . " Bell , you must stop and realize that this is a very solemn moment in the lives of both of us , " he began , and she cut it short with " You 're telling me ? " as the little pastor quavered , " If you please now ! " Hearing an entirely illegitimate sound above them , Annabel looked up and discovered that the pastor 's twins were peering down at the enchanted mystery through the hot-air register in the ceiling , vigorouslyp143pushing each other and commenting , " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid anyways five dollars for that hat . What do they want to get married for ? Hey , quit shoving me ! " She wanted to laugh , but she grew sober as she understood that the pastor was cutting her ' off from all the white , shy , maiden life she had known , with the timid solemnity of his question , " Do you take this man to be your lawful husband ? " After the ceremony , the little pastor said only , " Dearly beloved , I am not wise , and I do n't know much about the rich city you come from , and all I can do is hope and pray you two will be as happy as my wife and I have been in our little house , and help each other the way she helps me every day . " Annabel wanted to cry , then . She looked at Howard . His mouth was open , his eyes beseeching , and on his nose a tear was absurd and beautiful . But the time when she suddenly did cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to find , standing by the door , unexpected , unexplained , Fred and Hazel Cornplow , holding out to her their plain plump hands.  |p144THE  INITIAL SALARY received by Howard Cornplow , a new apprentice at the Triumph Motor Agency , was twenty-five dollars a week , which was eighteen a week as a worker and seven a week as a son . He started in as a salesman , and he liked it . He pictured himself in a **27;5364;TOOLONG , spurting all over the district , crowing over his former fellow prisoners at Truxon College next fall , and with lush commissions investing in the stock market and becoming a millionaire . He bought a suit of imported Harris tweed and , for no reason that he could ever explain , a pair of binoculars , which he kept in his demonstrator . Meanwhile , on one day at least , he borrowed lunch money from his shaggy second cousin , Cal Tillery . But he did not sell any cars , not any cars at all , and Fred noticed this more than he did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the office , at close of the day 's work . Swinging his foot good-naturedly , Howard chuckled ,  | " Ca n't take very long , Dad . Bell and I are going out and shoot some golf . " " Son , I do n't want you to think I 'm grouchy . But it 's time now " Oh , golly , Dad , Bell is always saying it 's time now ' to do some confounded thing or other ! " " Dry up till I finish ! I said it 's time for you to settle down to work .

I 'll buy you a dry martini . " While Howard and Annabel had been on their honeymoon of a week ( which Fred had felt was all heought , for their own sakes , to give them ) , he had found for them a three-room flat with appreciable light and air . Three months ' rent he paid , and Hazel and he , somewhat timidly , provided electric stove and refrigerator , beds and a few chairs , and painted dining furniture .

He came in for coffee or lunch once or twice a week ; he found that , as she often asserted , Putnam Staybridge had taught her perfection in making soups and desserts , canapes and salads . But she had never learned to cook roast beef or bread pudding or porridge , she was not precise in bedmaking , and she belonged to the school of sweepers who leave rolls of dust under the bureau . She did perceive the sloppiness of her housekeeping , and day after day he saw her trying to remember where she had put the ice pick , trying to clean the ash trays and the glasses which their friends had left on every chair and table at last night 's party. lie sighed , " Du n no how come , but I feel more at home eating sinkers and lukewarm coffee off a soapbox with Annabel than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There were , to him , only five types of wine : champagnewine , sherry wine , red wine , California wine and cowslip wine , of which , as he understood it , only the first was to be drunk for pleasure and not to flatter one 's host . ) The third issue of Protest &; Progress contained two articles which irritated Fred beyond tolerance . He read them on an evening when Sara was away and , despite the sweet vision of sleep , he stayed up , girt for battle . The first article stated that rarely had there been so persuasive a proof that all Americans were fools as had been seen during the recent visit of General Kynok , of the Soviet air corps . Aside from beingp149entertained by the American airmen , invited to lunch by the President , urged to lecture in several cities , and shown all our landing fields and aeroplane factories , he had been ignored . This curtain lecture was accompanied by a few sound generalizations : ( 1 ) It is glorious for a Russian to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) Any American who is ready to defend his country and has become a soldier is either a bloodthirsty fiend or has been misled by the paid hypnotizers of Capitalism . ( 3 ) The Russian air fleet is stronger than those of any other three countries combined . ( 4 ) America , if she had any sort of nice feeling , would be devoting herself to helping defenseless and aeroplaneless Russia . ( 5 ) General Kynok was at once a Wellingtonian commanderand a true-blue , tail-wagging Proletarian comrade . That essay was merely an appetizer for the article in which Gene Silga urged that the Pragg Glassworks , the largest industry in Sachem Falls , be organized forthwithas a closed shop , and since it had been successful in resisting organization , that this be done by violence . He advised the workers to buy rifles , to form classes in marksmanship , to study Georges Sorel . Fred was raving , when Sara appeared , after midnight . " Wait a minute , " she said crisply . " You 're just an amateur scold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him an early edition of the Sachem Falls Recorder , the morning paper , open at the third page.  | The right-hand column was filled with a story headed : " Mayor and Council Denounce Local Red , " which announced that one Eugene Silga was a notorious Bolshevik , that his paper was inciting to riot , and that the Board of Aldermen , with the mayor in attendance , would take up , tomorrow , means of ridding the city of Silga and his followers . " You better get out of town ! " agonized Fred . " No . I ca n't run away . " " Yes . That 's so . You ought n't to . But I certainly think you ought to stay away from Gene and your office a few days . " " I suppose you 're ashamed of me ! Perhaps it 's Mother and you that will want to run away ! " Mildly , rather surprised : " No  --  no . I do n't have to tell you I do n't like what P. &; P. ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with unemployability the only test of employability . But of course I want to help you any way I can " " There is one thing you can do : help straighten up the office accounts . With this beastly attack , I expect all our beastly creditors will be surging into the office tomorrow , clamoring to be paid . " " They might be . Some businessmen do like to be paid ! I 'll step around in the morning . " " If you 'd care to , " she said indifferently , as she started upstairs . Fred 's splendid rage had gone damp . Once more he had discovered that even when you have a sinner exactly where you want him , he still may have something to say ; that it is , perhaps , a mistake to rehearse a playp151without inquiring whether your opposite is going to have some lines also . He did not long brood on his failure . He knew that his daughter , beneath her icing , . must be disheartened . He paddled to the upper hall and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumping about her room . He longed to go in and have what he called a " real talk with her . " Suddenly , feeling lonely , he saw that not for years had Sara and he talked with easy simplicity . This Coheeze disaster might be a bridge between them . Did children , afraid to ask their parents for favors , know how often those parents were afraid of seeming ridiculous or bossy , and how they hovered , hesitating , outside bedroom doors ? He knocked . There was no hearty " Come in . " Sara evidently burrowedaround for a dressing gown before she opened the door , with an annoyed " Yes ? " " Nothing , nothing , daughter . Just  --  well , I wanted you to know I 'd help , any way I can . " " Oh , thanks , " she said bleakly . Fred had never been in the Coheeze office , and when he climbed to it , at ten the next morning , he felt uncomfortably that he had returned to his early days of canvassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and muddy heelprints , they smelled of yellow soap , and they displayed the signs of an electrichealer and of a philanthropist who sold loaded dice " for scientific purposes only . "  |p152In  his one glance about the Coheeze office , Fred rather liked it , reminded of the crazy tents , littered with fishing tackle and old shoes , in which he had camped as a boy . Gene and Sara were sitting on their tables , muttering anxiously . " Well , Gene , this is kind of hard luck . " " Eh ? Oh , how d' you do , Mr Cornplow . Hard luck is right . I get all the blame , but how could I guess ? " " You might ' ve known " I was following instructions absolutely . Now , I suppose , I wo n't get a cent more money . " " You could hardly expect the Channing Praggs to come through when you 've jumped on the source of all their cash " " Praggs ? Praggs ? Oh ! Them ! We are n't talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witheringly , " Of course not ! " while the young Fred felt like a calf in the scornful company of these , his elders . Gene condescended : " I do n't mind the press roasting me , either . That 's my job , stirring them up . My trouble is with the C.P. " " Oh yes . The C.Y. ? " " Good heavens , Father ! " from Sara . " The Communistparty , of course . " " Oh , I see . " Gene sighed , " I 've just had a long wire from them this morning . . . . I 'm a good radical , but I never did understand why it is that the harder up a left-wing organization is , the more it sends out hundred-word night letters that could just as well go under a three-cent stamp . . . . Happen to notice that in the last T. &; P. '  |p153I  gave quite a boost to the Russian general , Kynok ? " " Urn-huh . " " The real model for all American soldiers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , the Party wires me that Comrade Kynok was secretly arrested in Moscow day before yesterday , as a spy for Japan , and tried last night , and of course he will be shot this morning . Kynok ! That stood with Stalin 's arm about his shoulders while 175,000 children marched past them , saluting , a month ago ! How could I know ? Now , I suppose I 'm a Jap spy and a Trotskyite , too ! " " But big leader like that , Gene , prob'ly they 'll find him innocent . " Gene turned on his smile , friendly , a little cynical . " Nope . They do n't waste time in Moscow . They do n't spend the State 's money inquiring whether somebody'sinnocent unless they can prove he 's guilty . It 's a new system of justice ! Good Lord , I sound like a counter-revolutionary ! Sorry . Well , I 've got to get to work writing a piece telling how I finally got onto Kynok , the dirty , treacherous rat ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ratroot  --  rut'less , that 's my tune  --  my rune  --  oh hell ! " Gene 's typewriter began firing , shooting out flames , the platen turning red hot , the gunner 's face grim . Sara suggested , almost civilly , " You wanted to look over our accounts , Father ? " He indicated that such had been his presumptuous longing.  |p154She  led him to a third kitchen table , which the Coheeze office had extravagantly added to its equipment ; she pointed to a mess of letters , bills and tencentnotebooks , and said casually : " There 's our books . " After half an hour of rustling through papers like a discouraged sparrow scratching up gravel , Fred decided that he was not going to be able to " straighten up their accounts . " For there were no accounts . Except for transactions during their first week , they had noted down nothing whatever . Uncashed donation checks were mixed with unpaid bills . On torn slips of paper were such helpful notes as " Recd cash from J.K. , ten . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars from the Southside Marxian and Literary Club and a bill for sixty-five from a stationery firm , and the envelope was from neither party but from the MaplehurstLabor College . Fred was opening his mouth in wrath at such sacrilegeagainst bookkeeping when the tramp of a dozen heavy feet came from the rickety stairs below them.  | AT THE TRAMPING on the stairs , the three sprang up , Gene with quivering hand at his lips . " You scared ? " demanded Sara . " You bet I am ! Sounds like the cops . I 've been beaten by cops before ! " " They 've got no reason to arrest us . " " They do n't arrest you for reason  --  just for fun ! " Fred took command  --  not these many years had he dared to command Sara . " You two get out of this ! Hustle up on the roof and hide . I know lots of the cops . " They hesitated , and his voice became military . " Hear me ? Get out ! Beat it ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he had proper business here . He sat squarely at the table , pencil in hand , notebook and bills before him , but he was trembling , and afterward he found that the only entry he had made in the notebook was : " Scared myself . " He was gravely drawing ballet girls on a blotter when ,  |p156like  pigs bursting out of an opened pen , into the room sprang a police sergeant and five patrolmen , all with clubs in their fists , a couple with hands on pistol holsters . " What the ! " grunted the sergeant . " Well I 'll be ! " intelligently commented the others . " Hello , Sergeant . Afraid you 're too late . Your birds have flown the coop , " Fred caroled . He remained seated ; he knew that to be the safest position against a thug not too drunk . " Who are you ? Oh . It 's Mr Cornplow . What you doing here ? Where 's this anarchist guy ? " " Skipped town , I 'm afraid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owes me for a light truck , damn him ! " " What makes you think he 's gone ? " " My daughter saw him off at the train . " " Oh , that 's so ! She was mixed up in this . " " She just worked here  --  she talked it over with my friend , the mayor , before she took the job . She has no responsibility . " " Well , I do n't want her , anyway . Get busy , boys ! " It was appalling to the placid Fred , the gloating frenzy with which the boys " got busy . " From somewhereout in the hall axes were brought , and they gleefullywent to work . There is no greater bliss than to be destructive as hell while being moral as heaven . The guardians of the law smashed tables , threw a typewriter through a closed window , with hysterical laughter . Reporters and news photographers were somehow suddenlythere , very cheerful , and it was the glare of a flashlight bulb that startled Fred into action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have faced a chronic dead beat . " Stop this business or I 'll have the whole bunch of you kicked off the force ! I represent the creditors , and you have no court order " Do n't need none . " " I 'll sue you , personally , for every cent of damage ! Look , Sergeant  --  chase all these roughnecks out of here , and I 'll explain . " " Outside , youse , " said the sergeant , wiping his hand on the seat of his trousers , that it might be clean to receive the dirty money . Fred 's argument was brief : it consisted entirely in a twenty-dollar bill and the reminder that , already , the sergeant had been photographed enough to ensure publicity . " I would like to get hold of that there atheist Silga , though . Hate to have the cops in the next town find we let him go without marking him , " mourned the faithful sergeant , as he departed , after giving his inspiringlesson in How to Make Communists . Fred sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room , he , who had hated all Reds , was positively loving in his address : " Son , better get going quick-get out of town . They want to beat you . I finagled the cops out , but they might come back . " Sara said sniffily , " I suppose you bribed them ! I suppose you were humble to them ! " " I certainly was  --  I bribed and humbled and I lied , you little prig , you Soviet Salvation Army lassie ,  |p158you  Grrrr ! Gene , got any compromising papershere ? Get ' em out quick . " " Only the C.P. telegram this morning . I burn ' em . " That telegram Gene was taking from a telephone book and tucking into his pocket . " Want to hide out at my house , Gene ? Seeing Sara was in this with " I do not ! I 'm leaving town . " " You probably are n't very flush . Can you use this ten bucks ? " Gene took the bill disdainfully  --  oh , he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed for the door . " Gene ! " wailed Sara . " Well ? " " Ca n't we help you with your baggage ? " " Baggage ? You 're very funny , Comrade Cornplow ! " Gene snarled . " My baggage consists of two suitcasefuls  --  one of them books  --  which is what I have to show for my twenty-seven years  --  six of ' em spent in either being beaten by cops , or enduring middle-class females playingat being free souls , like you ! " " Gene ! " It slashed Fred 's heart to see with what agonized fondness his daughter was looking at the young man . " But you remind me , Sara , " remarked Gene , and for a second his reckless smile came back . He dialed on the telephone , and murmured , " Miss Kitz , please . . . . Oh , Frieda , this is Gene . . . . Yes , they 've been here  --  wrecked everything . I 'm hitchhiking out of town and glad of it . I 'll meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . O.K. ? . . . Fine . Au f Wieder-sehen ! " He turned debonairly on the Cornplows with , " You see , you need n't worry about my future now , Mr Cornplow ! You would n't be a bad sort , if you just had the sense to realize that your good-natured , democratic sort of middle-roadishness is plumb finished  --  or will finish , in front of a stone wall . " " I suppose you want me to play safe and join the Communist party ! " Fred believed that he had been chillingly sarcastic , but Gene answered serenely , " No , I 'm afraid we would n't want you ! " and Gene was gone . Fred turned pitifully to Sara , who was standing mute , hands at her breast . " Honey , it 's what you get if you mix up with folks that are crazy for power . Were you awfully fond of Gene ? " The tornado struck him squarely : " Gene ? You call that little guttersnipe Gene ' ? I hate him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology to me . ' Fond ' ? Oh , ca n't you even begin to understand me ? . . . I 'm going to the tennis club . I 've been neglecting my game . I 'm going out for it seriously now . But before I play , I 'm going to have a Tom Collins and see if I ca n't wash the taste of all this vulgarity out of my mouth . " She looked indignantly down on the parent who had wished upon her these unpleasantnesses , the Coheeze and Protest &; Progress and the police . She said , from the doorway , " It 's all very distasteful to me . Bribery ! Insisting that I 'm such a fool as to like that little rat , Silga . Very  --  distastefulindeed ! " Fred was left alone with a mess of unpaid bills . " I wo n't pay one cent of ' cm ! " he stormed  --  with twenty-five-per-cent honesty . An hour later , in front of a miraculously straightened table , he added , " I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grateful son and daughter , but now I know what old man Solomon meant when he said , Comfort me with apples for I am sick of love ! ' "  | AS AN APPRENTICE MECHANIC at the TriumphAgency , Howard was popular . For a couple of days he sulked at grease and overalls , the time clock and an aching back , but he discovered that the workmen were as individual as the pedigreed young gentlemen he had known in college , and more vigorous in humor . Their stories of jobs and girls and drunks , of the navy , the Pacific Coast , Detroit , seemed to him better than the giggling of young collegians , and it became important to him to be one of the boys . He learned that nobody will find it out  --  at least not till the rear end burns out , months later  --  if you save your energy by squirting only a quarter enough grease into the differential . He learned to get something very like a nap , after lunch and a couple of Bourbons , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the springs with a hammer now and then . And the chief mechanic was indulgent when the Son of the Boss got a group about him and taught them " Three Cheers for Old TruxON. "  |p162Howard  perceived that he had been wrong in regardinghis second cousin , Cal Tillery , as a lout and a bore . Cal might never achieve life 's prime purpose and learn to sell automobiles to bankers ; Cal 's hair might resemble a raveled gunnysack ; but in the wholesome fastnessesof the Adirondacks , Cal had developed a rustic slyness that to Howard seemed sharper than the booktaughtperceptions of Guy Staybridge . He played poker with the tenacity of one who had learned it in the haymow ; waitresses might laugh at him , but they did walk out with him ; and for all city slickers and their rules , Cal had contempt . No scolding from his father could embarrass Howard so much as Cousin Cal 's drawling , " You going to go society on us , are you , Big Boy , and put on the Tuxedo and play bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cal started by borrowing money from Howard ; it ended with Howard 's borrowing from Cal and nervouslyvolunteering to his father that Cal was a jewel and they must never lose him . Fred listened with no comment beyond that of his wrinkling eyebrows . Fred was calling upon Ben Bogey , " Homes that are nice at lowest price . " " Cutting out the bunk , Mr Bogey , how much chance do you think you 'd stand of making a living if you and my son started a firm together ? " " A living ? Why , Mr Cornplow , as sure as I 'm sittinghere , we 'd make twenty per cent on the invest-ment "  | " Whoa-up ! I asked could you two make a living ? In my experience , that totals a lot more than the twenty per cent that you boys seem to figure out on some kind of arithmetic different from what I studied . What real prospects you got ? " Mr Bogey showed letters . Three firms were willing to let him handle their apartment-house rents ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture into a human pasture . Fred mused , " Well , now , you take Howard , and what 's he got for you ? " " Oh , everything , Mr Cornplow ! Simply everything ! I cer'nly understand why you 're so proud of that boy . Good looks , nice voice , athletic training  --  gracious , how the ladies that are looking for suburban homes would fall for that fellow ! And fine education and nice dependablemanners  --  why , everything ! You do n't have to tell me ! " " As matter fact , I was going to tell you a few interesting facts about him . His education is phony . He can misspell in three languages . He has n't just learned the history of the U.S.  --  no indeed  --  he 's forgotten the dates and names in the history of the whole world . But aside from all this modern education stuff , he 's unpunctual , he chatters like a monkey all day long , when he 's supposed to be reconditioning cars , he wastes material , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he borrows money . Think you could do anything with him ? " " Sure . He 's the kind that needs freedom . "  | " How much would I have to put up for him , if he went in partnership with you ? " " I figured it would be five thousand dollars . " " Ca n't do it possibly . I 'll tell you . I 'll put up two thousand now . Three months from now , if you two are making a real , honest-to-God beginning , I may put in another two . " " It 's a go ! " So was Howard kicked upstairs ; so was the Triumph Agency saved from becoming a glee club ; and in the innocent belief that his own overwhelming charm had done it all , 1 toward began his career as a builder of cities , a king of contracts , a viceroy of choice rentals . Annabel was hanging the curtains in the bright new three-room office of the bright new firm of Bogey &; Cornplow , Realtors . Ben had chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best suburbs , and for their office chosen the ground floor of a cheerfullookingbuilding filled with doctors and dentists . Alreadyhe was out hustling for prospects , while Howard conducted the office , a task which , so far , had consisted in watching Annabel fill flower vases and the girl stenographer type " The quick brown fox jumped with zest over the gay lady . " He lighted a thin cigar with an air he had never shown in lighter college days , and to Annabel he pontificated : " This is something like it ! Course at the Triumph , the trouble was , I was kept back by being the owner 's son . Everybody took advantage of it and tried to borrowmoney "  | " Howard ! Please ! Howard ! " He threw down the cigar ; he became serious . " I know what you 're going to say , dear , every word ; and most of it 's true . I was loafing . And I did kinda borrow a little . But what was there ahead , stuck in that dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world by the tail ! I 'm going to work twenty hours a day , every day , by golly  --  uh  --  just soon as there 's any customers to work on ! " The Cornplow family had always taken its vacations together , in August or September , at some lakeside hotel . This year , with Howard 's marriage , with Sara 's revolution , with Coheeze creditors still to be pacified , with the Duplex booming , their vacation plans had been unmade . Fred sat with Hazel on the screened porch at the side of their house on a late July evening , very hot , conducive to bad tempers and rebellion . It seemed to him that he had been fighting a battle in the fog , with shadows that proved to be armed enemies and enemies that were mist ; and that he could depend only on the fixed cool light that was Hazel . " Say , uh , Hazel , do n't you think we better start thinking about what we 're going to do for vacation ? Looks like with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tennis club explaining she never was a communist , just you and I 'll go off together . First time in all these years , and will I enjoy it ! Let 's drive up to the Gaspe . Or how about putting the car on a lake steamer and going out to Duluth ? We 'll have some adventures ,  |p166too   --  no Sara along to highhat the populace ! Just us two old bums ! " " It would be nice , Fred , but The children have been talking with me . I know Howard expects to take Annabel and come with us . " " Now ? Just started in business ? Just married ? " " He says it would be cheaper " I see . He do n't so much want a trip with us as on us ! " " And Sara has an idea . She expects to play in a tennis tournament in the South , in October  --  down at Wormtail I lot Springs --  " That doggone dump ? Where the politicians boil out enough alcohol so they can enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes by herself , lemme tell you ! " " She feels that after the mistake she made about this fellow Silga 's character , she 's got to be extra respectable , and she has an idea that if we took a cottage at Wormtail together " Of all the " " I know , Fred , I know , but I also know how Sara is , and if she makes up her mind and starts nagging , we 'll give in to her to save trouble . The only way you could handle it would be to run away from her . " " Well , and what 's the matter with running away ? Hm ! Think I 'll take a little walk . " Hazel stared after him . Fred was excited , and she was afraid of spontaneous combustion.  |p167AT  TEN NEXT MORNING , a dusty and discouraged morning of July , Fred telephoned from the office : " Oh , Hazel ? Sara there ? " " No , she 's at the club . Anything I can do ? " " Just something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going downtown shopping , in about an hour , Fred . " " Say , wait for me at the house , will you ? Got anythingimportant on for today ? " " No , just coffee at Louise Kamerkink 's this after-noon . " " Fine . Wait for me . " He looked embarrassed , she was puzzled and a little anxious , when he came into the house at this unexampled hour of the day . " Lookit , Hazel . Grand day , and I 'm kind of tired . What say we jump in the car and skip off for two-three days ? " " Today ? " " Why not ? " d " Heavens , you have to make preparations ! " " Do n't need any . Gas and oil and a toothbrush and a comb and a nightshirt  --  what more do you need ? If you have to get a lipstick along the way , prob'ly there are some stores outside Sachem Falls ! I brought some cash from the office . " " If you 'd just told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anything you ca n't bust ? " " I do n't think that would be awfully nice of me . " " What ' d you do if you stepped off the curb and got killed by an auto ? Would n't be able to keep your dates then , would you ? " " Why , what a perfectly awful suggestion ! " " Well , it does happen sometimes , do n't it ? Hop to it and call ' cm off . " " You 're just as arbitrary as Sara . " " Sure . I inherited it from her . Can do ? " " Oh , I suppose --  " Get at it , then , and pack a bag  --  just toilet things and some underwear . " " But where  --  what " Thought maybe we 'd run over to Saratoga Springs and see the new buildings there . But the point is n't where we 're going ; it 's the fun of us two running off together . " " I think I might like it . " She was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag  --  the chief necessity in it , the latest P. G. Wodehouse novel . He telephoned to his secretary , at the office , that it was such a hot day  --  going take little run to Saratoga  --   |p169would  she call up Mr Howard and Miss Sara and  --  tell ' em be back endaweekmiddlanext . When Howard telephoned , as Howard was certain to , Fred was densely misunderstanding about the overwhelmingneed of Bogey &; Cornplow for his advice on importunate problems . He merely chuckled a little , inanelybabbled , " Yuh , thought I 'd check out for couple days  --  Saratoga , " hung up on Howard  --  though , to any salesman , hanging up is a crime ranking with malfeasanceand conversion  --  and did not answer the telephonewhen it rang again . That would be Sara . He knew that Sara would hurry right back to the house , but he also knew that Sara could never hurry right back anywhere without stopping to nag somebody about something , and indeed she did not arrive until five minutes after Fred had set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FenimoreCooper Boulevard , with Hazel warm and bewilderedbeside him . Though he felt that in his flight into Egypt there were several important principles illustrated , he was thinking less about his boldness in running away from the parental tyranny of his children than about the fact that in the taut gray suit and the small tricorne hat which Hazel had assumed for motoring she looked ten years younger than when , soft and flowing , hinting of the harem , she appeared in an afternoon frock , phony jewelry and household cares . He observed that she was beginning to permit herself the questionable privilege of enjoying life . Could she ever be cured of her servitude to Things , her love of Possessions and ofp170establishing her secure respectability by showing them off ? Could she ever be free of blue china and of lacy mats ? She said cheerfully , " It ' 11 be interesting to see Saratoga Springs . " " Yes , I guess maybe it would be , someday . " " How do you mean ? What are you being so mysteriousabout ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey ! I 'm the most mysterious guy in this whole length and breadth of Sachem Falls ' I 'm Frenzied Fred , the Masked Menace . I 'm right out of Edgar Wallace . I 'm J. G. Reeder , with a dagger in my fountain pen . " " Idiot ! What are you " " I 'm the man with three faces  --  all of ' em prob'ly a mistake . " " Darling , I thought I heard you sneak downstairs last night and have a little nip . " " It 's worse than liquor , woman . It 's the wine of life . It 's " " Please stop trying to be cute , Fred , and tell me what you 're up to . " " Oh , we 're merely taking the Golden Road to Samarkand ! " " Well , it may look so to you , but it looks to me like Route 29 ; and it may be gold , but right along here , there seem to he patches of cement . " " Do n't notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night and pinched this stretch of gold . You 'll see it again in couple blocks . " " Fred , dearest , I do n't mind , but are you cuckoo ? "  | " Completely ! See that man there ? " " What man where ? " " Sitting up on the hood of the car  --  the little fellow with the pointed hat and the green whiskers ? " " Oh  --  yes  --  well  --  I ca n't say I see him very clearly . " " You will , if you stick around with me long enough . That clears it all up , do n't it ? " Not a word more would he say till he had turned at right angles off Fenimore Cooper Boulevard , which led straight to Saratoga . Now , the car was headed southeast . " Where are we going ? " wondered Hazel . But she said it without alarm , for whatever she might think of Fred 's capacity as a romantic lover , he was to her the Beethoven of motoring . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car seems headed in the wrong direction . " " It does ? Doggone ! We 'll just have to go along with it , I guess . Too fast for us to jump . " " Frederick , will you please stop all this coyness " " I know . But I feel so cheerful and free  --  and unusual  --  andtherefore silly ! " " Well , quit it a moment , wo n't you ? I 'm sorry , but this is not the road to Saratoga I " " Whoever said it was ? " " Are n't we going to Saratoga ? " " Whatever made you think we were ? " " I heard you telephoning to Howard " " Has it ever been your opinion that our darling son is a safe man to trust the truth with ? " " Then where are we going ? "  | " I think  --  unless we change my mind  --  we 're going to an inn at Stonefield , Mass. , east of Lenox . But does it matter where we land up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can quit being responsible parents for a few days and see if we 're still human beings also ? How about it ? " " I  --  I do n't think it 's such a bad idea . I do like going with you . " " Remember one evening I was kind of talking about retiring ? I have n't forgotten it . Maybe I 'm not so satisfied with what Fred Cornplow has done with life . I want to try and see  --  just experiment and try and see if there are n't some new things I 'm not too old to learn , just for the fun of learning ' em . And then --  About Sara and Howard . One reason for this running off is , I figure that if I can be plumb away from ' em for a while , where they ca n't find us and interfere , I 'll get over my irritation and quit being so mean to ' em . " " I did n't think you were so mean . " " Well , if you did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly set out to be mean . Maybe what I 'll get out of this trip will be ability to be a whole lot meaner .

" They sat for half an hour on a hilltop of rough uplandpasture , loud with insects ; they sat on the running board , contentedly saying nothing at all , and his cigarettetasted good . They had lunch at a farmhouse , under the maples ,  |p173and  he crowed , " you simply ca n't get real fried chicken and home-made ice cream like this in the city ! " She did not explain that the chicken had undoubtedly come from a can , the ice cream from a renowned creamery in Troy . They had , in midafternoon , an old-fashioned milk shake in a village drugstore and , while Hazel cooed at them to make them feel neighborly , Fred and the druggisttold each other that they had elegant motors , handsomeand co-operative children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that life was a good idea . Gray-haired , gray-browed , in gray alpaca jacket , his gray hands thin and long , the druggist leaned his elbows on the counter and meditated , " Nice thing about my business is , grand people like you come in and pass the time of day . " Fred went out to the car in a one-man parade . He liked to be grand people , reflected Hazel . " Set that man down in Warsaw or Tokyo , " she thought proudly , " and inside an hour he 'd know the names of all the children of the nearest cigar-store man and all the taxi drivers and the policeman on the block . . . . In that , he 's like Howard . Maybe someday I 'll get my two men together ! " It was not over a hundred and fifty miles from Sachem to Stonefield , and for Fred , normally , that was one third of a day 's driving , but they so happily dawdled , enchanted by deep meadows and thick trees , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and filling up with gas at the Daisy Dell Cabins and Cafe , All Home Comforts , Flats Fixed.  |p174The  Daisy Dell establishment seemed to have been constructed by the carpentry class of a kindergarten . The only reason , Hazel surmised , why no resolute burglar had picked up a couple of the cabins and carriedthem away was that they would have been of use for nothing but kindling . With distress she heard Fred cackling , " Say , I got an idea ! What 's say we spend the night at this dump ? " " But we could be in Stonefield in time for dinner , easy , and I think these cabins look awfully sloppy . " " Sure . Prob'ly are . But be kinda fun  --  be a change , camping out .

"  |p175THE  DAISY DELL CABINS were thin and tall , with a listto leeward ; they were of clapboards , once painted white , but the raw pine had soaked up the paint . The yard before them was lined with gravel and cinders and inhabitedby a shamefaced dog given to constant scratching . Something more had been done with the " cafe , " the camp 's central building , a four-room shanty with a public room fresh painted a bright yellow and containing chairs and tables in booths , and a counter for five-cent bars of decayed candy , cigarettes , pies , and " souvenirs " in a way of china ash trays lettered " Greetings from Butiful Daisy Dell . " Pa and Ma Stickle were the proprietors . Pa had a mustache apparently made of raw cotton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt should have been tucked in oftener , and Ma had smut on her nose . Yet they were friendly as old milk-route horses , and seemed instantly to recognize Fred as one of their own disreputable race of vagabonds.  | When Fred had registered  --  he wrote it down " FrederickWilliams , N. Y. , " so that he might not be traced  --  Pa Stickle whispered , " Say , neighbor , of course we have n't got a license here , but a fellow I do n't know his name left some applejack and I thought maybe you might be thirsty after driving --  " Fred drank , then choked , gurgled , looked around as though wondering who had hit him , and immediately became hilarious . Hazel had a finger of applejack in gingerale , hiccupped , murmured , " Gracious sakes alive ! " and began to giggle . When she heard Fred laughing at her , she stared at him with mild bovine disapproval and suddenly became as hilarious as he . They did not dine till seven , two hours later , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Pa Stickle all about themselves and listened while Pa narrated that he had been a ship 's cook , a vaudevilledancer , an arctic explorer and ( since Fred and Hazel seemed to have swallowed all this , as safely as they had the applejack ) a trader in the Solomon Isles . " That 's a grand old boy , and I 'll bet anyway five per cent of his stories are true , " glowed Fred , as Pa departed to bring their hamburg steak with fried onions . Hazel was more or less serious . " But d' you think we ought to start off our journey by associating with such low people ? " " Low ? Low ? Thank God they 're low ! After Sara , Pa tastes good to me  --  like a mutton chop after a diet of cheese souffle . I love to be low . Like getting back top177earth . Provided it ai n't Cousin Enos Tillery 's earth . Do n't want any earth in my ears ! " " Well But I 'm sure the hamburgs wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazel left unconsumed only one snippet of fried butcher 's paper which had got in among the onions . From the Daisy Dell , only a couple of farmhouses were to be seen , far off , but by eight o'clock the place was filled with rustic versions of Sara and Howard . The cafe did smell , rather , of frying pans , gasoline , cabbage and Stickles , but it was lively with yellow paint and pink paper doilies and soft-drink posters showing bathing girls , and it crackled now with jokes fresh from the radio . Fred admired one young lady in a silk frock decorated with red poppies , in silk stockings and silver slippers , who sat on a high stool delicately sippinga lemonade into which her escort , a young man with a plaid pullover and an irremovable camel's-hair cap , kept pouring gin . " Expensive-looking pair , " Fred hinted to Pa Stickle . " The young lady in silk . " " Her ? Oh yes . Smart girl . She 's daughter of Ole Man Bocks , up the road here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning down folks ' barns , seems like he just ca n't keep from it , somehow , and she 's got a fine job , working for Doc Onderdonck 's folks down in the village  --  eight dollars a week , yessir and the washing sent out . You bet . But that ai n't no silk  --  it 's rayoneleven-fiftyfor the dress and ' tai n't paid for , neither ! " " Oh dear , I 'm afraid this place is too fast for con- servative people like us , " yawned Hazel . " I 'm going to bed right away . " " I 'm going to hit the hay pretty sudden myself , " agreed Fred . But at eleven , when Hazel had slipped off to their cottage , Fred was playing poker in the kitchen with Pa Stickle , a brush salesman , the local auctioneer , who was also the local assemblyman , and a hired man , and was losing steadily to all of them and enjoying it . AfterwardMa Stickle invited them to share what she called " couple sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brown bread , clam chowder , honey , cold fish and applejack . All of it Fred devoured ; he imitated Pa Stickle in lying preposterously about his travels ; and he went across the cinder courtyard to bed in his cabin , weaving and inclined to music . Fred did not look very closely at their cabin at Daisy Dell until he awoke , in the sway-backed bed , on a mattress filled with iron ore and paving stones , at eight in the morning . Ile had a head , and he knew that Dr Kamerkink would have been profane about his liver and blood pressure , but he lay and chuckled at his idiocy of the night before . With slight whimpers as the sutures of his skull cracked open and closed again , he sat on the bed , surveying the caravansary in Samarkand for which they had given up their pink-and-cream bedroom . It was the largest cabin at the Dell ; a double one , containing no furniture except the two wiggly iron beds , two straight chairs , a piano lamp minus its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer . The wall was covered with plaster the color of withered lettuce , with mapshapedholes where the plaster had fallen , but gloriously , startlingly , on it were hung , by count , nine pictorialcalendars , presenting kittens in baskets , cherries in baskets , little girls tormenting little dogs , and a church beside a moonlit lake . Fred turned to look at Hazel , and she was lying drowsily awake , smiling at him . " Is n't it lovely  --  the room , " she said , blessedly makingno comment whatever upon his hour of returning last night . " But what I was thinking was : I never enjoyed a drive in my life as much as yesterday . When we were a young married couple , there were always the children along , bawling and asking questions . Rememberhow Sara used to say Why ? " Ma-ma , why is that man plowing the field ? ' So he can plant his seed  --  now hush , dear . ' Why ? ' So he can grow crops . ' Why ? ' So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can support his family . ' Why ? ' " " Sensible question , the last one . " " And ever since , seems like we 've always had to get somewhere on time , and then get right back for an important engagement . ' " " I did n't know how you 'd feel this morning , when you woke up and had another look at this dump . " " I do n't mind it , because I do n't have to worry about whether Hilda will get around to vacuum-cleaning it today . Honestly , did I ever worry about things like that ? Seems so long ago . " " Do n't it ! " What a little wizard he was , Fred ex- silted . Already he had Hazel half cured of her slavery to possessions . Then she was firmly remarking : " Fun here  --  for a change  --  for one night . But of course I did n't sleep much . This mattress is like a relief map of the Adirondacks . But it might be nice to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But of course we 'd want it nice  --  you know  --  a swimmingpool and a greenhouse , oh , just a little one . But nice . And I do think , mornings when you do n't feel so good , it 's economy in the long run to have the girl bring you a nice breakfast in bed . " " Well , " said the diminished Fredk Wm.  |p181HE  HILLS were not so proud as their own Adirondacks , but softer , more feminine , thought Fred , as they came to Stonefield , a dormered and white-spired hamlet in the Berkshires . The tavern , where Fred again craftily registered as Frederick Williams , N. Y. , was no Daisy Dell , but a competent gray-shingled inn , and the annex cottages were isolated on the slope of a hillside dark with pines , light with maples , gleaming with a cleared meadow . In front , the Cornplows ' cottage looked from a halfscreenedwide porch , through the columns of a pine grove , to a meadow , and to a pond which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shield of rose and black just after sunset . At the back , from a minute brick terrace edged with gloxinia , it looked up to the hills , which led the exploring eye from a mountainridge to ever higher ridges beyond . There were but three rooms : living room , double bedroom , and kitchen with dining alcove . The cottagers could prepare their own meals or dine at the tavern.  |p182The  rooms were ceiled with soft-stained pine ; the only pictures were a few sharply colored prints ; the fireplace was of the simplest  --  brick with a pine mantel ; and everything possible had been built in : bookshelves , bureau , dressing table , couch . The dishes , Hazel found , gently squealing with domestic fervor , were of the best five-and-ten-cent native pottery , made by handmade machinery ; there were , incredibly , enough ash trays , and these devised to hold ashes and butts and not to display reproductions of the higher-class barnyard fauna ; the screen doors closed tightly without a bang ; and there was a shower as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Fred , with an idiotic look of bliss . He paraded around and around the cottage , as proud as once he had been , years ago , when he had first become an owner of property . That had been one lot , with a four-room yellow house , but every foot was miraculously different from all other earth . Why , its one maple tree had roots and branches and a real bird'snest , and the sun clung to its trunk , as it never did elsewhereon the block ! He discovered that the name of their cottage was William Tyler Longwhale . Anyway , said Hazel , that was better than naming the cottages Romeo and Portia and Desdemona . They never did find out who the historicalWilliam Tyler Longwhale may have been , but Fred insisted on giving their hermitage its full fruity name . They sat on their porch at dusk . There had been strawberry shortcake for dinner , down at the tavern ; they were full of shortcake and humanitarianism . Thep183meadow below them was hysterical with unusually late fireflies ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D ' you realize , " marveled Hazel , " that this is the first time we 've had a house that 's entirely our own ? " " I had some such an idee , " said Frederick William . Not even to a subagent who might order fifty cars had Fred ever paid such court as he now was paying to Hazel . He had brought his clubs , and Hazel expected him to spend hours a day golfing , during which time she planned to do a little happy , unnecessary cleaning . But he was irritated at having to do anything , even follow the rules of golf . " Coupla days , what say we just stroll ; not go anywhere in particular , " he proposed to Hazel , and she pondered , " Why , yes , I suppose we could ! " Panting a little , very sweaty , observing that Fred 's " wind " had not been improved by cigarettes , carrying extra sweaters and wishing they had n't , delighted at the convenience of stopping to see a view without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two benevolent caterpillars gone vertical , up peaks from which they peered at the placid valley of the Housatonic , into orchards where early apples were afire in the long sweet grass , through pine groves which rememberedold German fairy stories . On the multicoloredstone flagging of the terrace at the King 's Arms , the grand hotel of the region , where Austrian counts , their Chicago countesses , and even proud Amherst and Williams students skied all winter , they lazily drankp184to each other , not to a nervous gang of Sachem citizens determined to be gay and like it . But Fred 's favorite goal was the country store in Stonefield Center , with its back door opening on forty acres of pasture and sugar maples . Amid the overalls , slabs of dried codfish , patent medicines , and countryauctionposters , Hazel and he sat on boxes and listened to the storekeeper 's libelous stories about Judge Basser , down the road , of whose housekeeper , who had been with him for twenty-seven years now , people were beginning to suspect the worst . When they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing tobacco , dusty and quiet and serene , Hazel sighed , " I like going there . Oh dear , I do n't suppose there ' 11 be any old-fashioned stores left in ten years  --  just glass and air-conditioning and telephone . " " I thought you were the one that liked all these modern improvements  --  electric kitchens , " he jeered . " Well , that 's different , " she answered in her adequate , wifely way . Their house in Sachem , he perceived , no longer belonged to them except by the artificial convention of deeds and lawbooks . It belonged to Sara , to Howard , to Annabel , to their friends , to the telephone company and the gas-furnace man and the meter reader , to their maid , and to their maid 's sister , sister-in-law , and sister-in-law 's sister 's son and his large red toy automobile . But William Tyler Longwhale was theirs alone . Ip185Hazel had so zealously taken to housekeeping that she wanted to prepare not only breakfast but lunch and dinner . He caught her just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt of domestic discipline . " That 's why we ran away , to avoid fussing . " " Well , I just thought I 'd fix up a bite for lunch  --  just some cold meat  --  no real cooking . " " I see . Just cold meat . And a little soup , maybe ? " " Oh yes , I thought I might make a little hot soup " " And a couple hot vegetables ? " " No , only one . Honestly . Just some nice peas . " " And hot potatoes , of course . " " Oh , of course , potatoes ! " " How about dessert ? " " Oh , a tiny bit of prune whip  --  so light  --  nothing to make " You know , Hazel , you read where women are so much more dependable about bringing up kids and caringfor property than men . Fact is , women overelaborateeverything and make life twice as complicated as any normal man ever would , and then they kick becausethe men do n't jump in and kill themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . You can bet no male ever invented dancing schools for children , or lace collars , or sweet little bows to parents , or eating with forks , or saying please ' and thank you . ' No man ever invented perfume or round flower beds or service plates or doilies or velvet upholsteryor dress suits and boiled shirts  --  and if somep186tailor invented ' em , well , he did n't do it ; his wife did ! " " In other words , women have been trying to make life a little pleasant and civilized , while men prefer to live in mud dugouts and never wash , " said Hazel , firmly , as she started to make the prune whip.  |p187MEN  AT THE DANGEROUS AGE , between forty-five and sixty , occasionally do land in court and have to writhe over their letters beginning " Sweetest little earwig , " but most of them have not only forgotten how to make love but forgotten that there ever has been so extraordinary a mania as that in which competent young males believe that some run-of-the-mill female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any deceptionor anything up the sleeve , a young woman with toothaches , freckles , the hives , and admitted ignorance of Bach and biochemistry , is a new Helen of Troy . Fred was of the more fortunate fraction . He exalted Hazel not as a being of fire , ice and chronic hysteria , but as a companion true as bread and salt . He had heard that a man sees the aging of his contemporariesbut never sees it in himself . But while he was conscious of his own swelling middle , his violent lack of interest in anything happening after one A.M. , and the torture of trying to interest elfin young females skipping about at dances , yet in Hazel he could see no change . Oh yes . She did have gray hair . What of it ? Went beautifully with her blue-eyed pinkness . And maybe the least bit more plump ? Improved her . Did n't he seem to remember that , thirty years ago , she had been too skinny ? He sang to her " Ev'ry morn I bring thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morn was fresh eggs . He walked all the way to the King 's Arms for chocolate pralines and the New York tabloids , and what could more add to a vagabond vacation than pictures of hammer slayers and punctured gunmen ? Every night he kissed her ; every morning he patted her hand . Ile admitted that these attentions might fall short of rapture , but he guessed that if he had done anything more , she would have been justifiably suspicious about his recent private conduct . He knew that in exile she was happy . Shesmiled at him naturally , and she hummed over the morning ham and eggs . I le was not conscienceless enough to be quite happy in deserting his family . When he walked alone at twilight , or in the tavern lounge he heard the radio play old songs , he remembered the curly-headed , tiny Howard , with a kitten , and the minute Sarah  --  not Sara , then  --  who had demanded the string cradles that no one but Daddy could make . The worst thing about real babies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies and kittens . In such an hour of gray nostalgia he could not have endured exile without the presence of Hazel . He dashed back to her for protection , and he fretted , while she sat before the rustic dressing table , her handsome armsp189upraised to her hair , " Say , hon , maybe we ought to write the folks now  --  see how the Duplex and the new-marriedcouple are getting on . " " Do n't you do any such a thing , Fred . Let ' em learn how to get along by themselves for a while . " " Well , if you think so --  " he said . And next morning , when Hazel was brisk over the stove , and he came in with an armful of wood , feeling like Paul Bunyan , the god of the lumber choppers , he crowed , " Are you happy ? " Once , placidly knitting on the shadow-dancing porch of William Tyler Longwhale , Hazel explained , . " Of course you spoiled both our children . You always were a man to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over you , and then you fly right to the other extremeand want to run off to Abyssinia to get away from ' em . " " Maybe . But is n't it the craziest doggone thing in this crazy world today , where half the nations are willing to go to war for the right to be slaves , that children have become the bossy parents , now , and the parents scared kids ! Say , how did an easygoing couple like me and you ever have such a pair of Japanese waltzing mice for children ? " " Spoiled ' em , I tell you . You and me . " Hazel was more placid than ever . " Maybe . " " Let 's go up to the King 's Arms and have , a cock-tail . " " Fine . Happy ? " " So happy ! "  | On the seventh morning of their refuge in Stonefield , Fred awoke at six-thirty , too gay and clear-headed to lie abed . He marched out to the porch , down to the drift of pine needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth was chilly , yet he did not seem to be chilled . " Reg'lar grizzly , that 's what I am ! " he gloated . The ticklish needles felt good to his feet , and the scent of pines and earth and grass and dew was a curtain shutting him away from the odors of gasoline and wet cement . From inside he could hear the sleepy-headed Hazel grousing , " What an hour to be getting up " Ile bellowed that she was to stay in bed . In the kitchen he plugged in the coffee percolator and returned to the porch to loll on a swing couch , violently at peace . He heard I Iazel padding about the kitchen ; she could not yet believe that a man could master so difficult a domestic task as measuring coffee and water into a percolator . She came out with two cups on a very fine tray which they had bought at the country store for ten cents ; she perched beside him and kissed his cheek . " What say we take William Tyler Longwhale for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks or so , I could go hack to Sachem for maybe one day . " " Yes . Let 's ! Oh , good heavens ! Oh , no ! " A Triumph Special sedan had slid out of the pine grove and up the grassy road to their porch , and out of it were dribbling Sara and Howard . With suspicious sweetness , Sara commented , " Oh , Father ! Bare feet ? How cute ! "  |p191Fred  glanced down . They looked worse than cute ; they looked absurd , those objects called feet which till now he had taken for granted ; those flat blobs of flesh , pallid from city living , fringed with imitation fingers . But he flung at Howard , bravely enough , " How d' you ever find us here ? " " Oh , it took Ben Bogey all of half an hour on the long-distance telephone  --  he just described you and the car  --  a cinch , with those red fenders . We 've known where you were for three-four days now , but we thought we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a getaway . But now You promised Ben to let us have some more capital , and we need it pretty bad . And we got a chance for the contract on a new development , Capitola Lodge , but the owners want to talk to you . " " And the cook has quit  --  and I swear I do n't know why  --  I gave her so much attention , " said Sara . " And Annabel is awfully worried about you two getting rheumatism here . " " And I had to go to the Rochester tournament without any chaperon  --  oh , that was so thoughtless of you ! " " And Cal Tillery had a run-in with Paul Popple , and he thinks , and so do I , you ought to take a look at the way Popple tries to run things . " " And Louise Kamerkink says you promised to go to dinner there last Thursday . " " And Popple 's got some papers for you to . sign  --  he 's simply going nuts . " " And everybody 's talking  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annabel says that her father says that he knows this dump , and why did n't you go to the King 's Arms ? " " And the way I 've had to lie to people , and I hate to lie except when it 's necessary , and the Coheeze bills are still coming in , and not one word from Gene Silga . The double-crosser ! 1 Honestly , I hate to say it , but do n't you think it was a little thoughtless of you ? " " And of course , after all , Sara and Bell and I are only kids , and we 've done our best to carry on , but -- I 'd never think of trying to tell you your duty , but " " Well , I would ! I lonestly , my dears , I wish I could get the picture . What is it ? Brave bold pioneers , right out of the movies , returned to the simple days of our forefathers , when men were men and never bathed , and the brats were n't demanding , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to , and plowed beforebreakfast , and walked six miles to the li ' 1 ' red schoolhouse and liked it ? " " Grrrrr 1 " said Fred . Sara was laughing in quite a well-bred , filial manner as she went on : " Darlings , I do wish I could see you as tanned and resolute frontiersmen , but I just do n't ; I see you as pretty pale and overweight , and  --  do forgive me  --  in terrible shape for lack of exercise . You 'd have done much better , in my humble opinion , if you 'd stayed home and seen Dr Kamerkink and dieted and played golf . And , honestly , I do n't think a pre-Civil-War nightshirt is such a romantic garment ! And your dear li'l ' hideaway  --  ratherdamp , is n't it ? And did they have to go and give it a name like William Tyler Longwhale ' ? "  |p193Oh  yes , even with her dark Dianic power , that was the most that Sara could do to them : take away all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known , and the placid days , the sight of distant valleys and their sharing of renewed love seem the vain calf sickness of a premature senility . That was all she could do , but such as it was , she accomplished it with the skill she had learned in her diversified trainingas outlaw communist and polite tennis star . So Fred and Hazel went back into captivity . A week after their return to Sachem , Fred applied for their passports . When , or whether , they would ever be used , he did not know.  | THE AUTUMN , no very great season in the selling of motorcars , had become lively with the sale of trailers in which those citizens of Sachem Falls who had retired from the economic struggle , because they had too much money or too little , planned to go to Florida or Californiafor winter . The Duplex had been booming all summer , but in September , Fred 's treacherous rivals , the Conqueror Motor Company , dealt the Duplex a nasty blow with its announcement of the Allover Caravan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bus , with the motor contained in the body . It burst on Sachem with full-page newspaper advertisements which assertedconvincingly that the Allover was easier to drive , easier to park , and much easier to handle in passing other cars . As a minor virtue , in this war of transportationwith its almost theological disputation , the Allover'sfurnishings could readily be removed , turning it into a truck . A sound commercial warrior like Fred would havep195hated any opposition at all which took money away from him , but in this particular attack , he persuaded himself , there was something malign , for Putnam Staybridge , putative father to Annabel , was known to be part owner of the Conqueror company . And , Fred complained , had n't he gone and made a fool of himself and thought the Cornplows and the Staybridges were getting onto better terms ? For the good Putnam had invited Howard and Annabel for a week at his Adirondackcabin , and Sara for a week end .... Everybody except the persons concerned seemed to feel that Fred and Hazel had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day after the Allover advertisements appeared , Staybridge invited Fred to call upon him , at the general offices of the Liberty Bell Clock Company . " Hell with him ; let him come here and call on me ; I wo n't go a step , " growled Fred , as he reached for his hat . Staybridge 's office , with its large mahogany table for the directors and the small polished desk for the president , looked like a Colonial dining room . You could almost smell boiled codfish . Staybridge was cautiously cordial in his " How do . " " Hear you all had a fine time at the cottage , Brother Staybridge . " " Oh yes . Very agreeable . Your son  --  uh , Howard , uh  --  is an excellent swimmer . Really ! So sorry we did n't have room to invite Mrs Cornplow and yourself . " " Oh , we had our vacation . . . I suppose you might say . And what can I do for you ? " Staybridge looked as though he thought Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude ; in the damp cold air that Staybridge perpetually exuded , he always felt rude . But the gentlemanly assassin of Duplexes was saying graciously : " No doubt you will have noted the advertisements of the Allover Caravans  --  the Conqueror company . " " Good ads ! Fine ! " " Kind of you to say so . It just happens that I have some small interest in the Conqueror company . " " Ur . " " And I have thought of suggesting to them that they come to some agreement with you , possibly even joint advertising . Since your Duplex is a trailer , and the Allovernot , they need not exactly be in competition , and I was thinking that if we  --  or rather , I should say , they  --  combined , you might in a way dominate the field together  --  freezeout the others , I believe it is called . " " Yes . It 's called that . It 's also called stifling competition , and ganging up on the other racketeers . " " Oh ? What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by the Triumph company , you might conceivably try to arrange with the makers to disposeof it to us . Particularly since I understand from your son  --  uh , from Howard  --  that you are giving some thought to retiring in four or five years . " Staybridge 's persistent objection to remembering Howard 's name would have been enough to irritate Fred handsomely ; it wanted only the pinch-nosed patronagewith which Staybridge was going on : " Of course I do n't know what you plan to do , if you retire . I should n't have thought you were cursed withp197hobbies , as I am . But no doubt you 'll find something with which to busy yourself , more or less . But the point is , if you feel like retiring , just possibly you might not care to face the rather sharp opposition that , I 'm afraid , the Conqueror company , with its large resources , is planning to give you . I 'm sure you 'd be wise to take it easy . " This to Fred Cornplow , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sara . He exploded up from his chair , but he managed to be fairly calm as he croaked : " Me ? Retire ? Where d ' you suppose Howard ( that 's my son ) ever got such a foolish idea ? Not me ! I like a scrap too well . But thanks for the tip . Morning ! " Opposite the large Conqueror agency , Fred hired a vacant lot , and within three days he had installed there a Duplex Trailer display in open air . He had one side ripped off a Duplex , so that its hidden domesticities were revealed . He engaged the two men and two young women of a stranded night-club troupe , with a couple of children , and this theatric family was displayed livingthe life of Riley in the trailer . They prepared and smackingly devoured large meals ; on the roof they drank tea and afterward danced to a radio ; they modestly retired , in the several chambers provided when the roof was hoisted ; and all one night they remained abed in the Duplex , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behold human beings engaged in so very odd a practice as sleeping . Duplex sales doubled , and Fred 's spy in the Con/queror agency reported that salesmen who attempted to demonstrate Allover Caravans were answered with jeers . A week after the opening of Fred 's circus , Staybridgetelephoned him again , but Fred found himself too busy to call . The next day Annabel came in , and Annabel was near to giggling . " My father asked me to tell you he thinks your Duplexcabaret is vulgar . " " Do you think so ? " " Yes . " " So what ? " " Oh , I like vulgarity . All the interesting things in life are so vulgar , Father Cornplow : birth and death and battles . I lave I done my job ? " " Ell ? " " IIave I complained properly about the vulgarity ? Darling ! " Next night a curious thing happened . A man named Tom McKuffee , a truck farmer who lived nine miles southeast of Sachem , and who had bought an Allover Caravan that afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In front of the Duplex show lot he tried to park his Allover , but the brakes failed , the Allover dashed into the lot and was wrecked against a pile of rocks which no one seemed previously to have noticed there . McKuffee , though he could not stop the caravan , had time to jump . Now he was no hit-and-run driver , even if the object of his solicitude was merely a pile of rocks . He walked to the police station , admitted the accident , and explained that the brakes had failed ; explained it sop199eloquently that a green reporter noted the fact in his story . The detail got past the copyreaders , and in the paper next morning there was an almost libelous statementabout the brakes of an Allover . It was only an item , but the scene of one caravan wrecked , while hard by , in another , night-club ladies were dancing and sipping ginger ale from highball glasses , was too much for the art editor of the evening paper . By this time , the struggle between Duplex and Allover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need of a legend to explain what were the makes of the caravans in the newspaper photograph . All the day after , persons who looked as though they might have trailer money in their pockets stood and admired the cabaret , snickered at the wreck . McKuffeehappened , by a coincidence , to be there , and he seemed glad to explain how the accident had occurred , and to point out how flimsy were the smashed and exposedfurnishings of the Allover . By another coincidence , Fred Cornplow knew McKuffee , who had once been the Triumph foreman . " You are rubbing it in . Old Putnam will never speak to any of us again , " Sara reproached her father , yet in her he detected admiration . In another day there were double-page advertisementsof the Allover in the papers , but people in limousines , in shops , on street corners laughed at them . The Allover wreck remained on the lot for a week . Then came the chief of police to Fred and offered to cart it away . " No , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing  --  what 's his name ?  --  McGurrey ?  --  till he raises the money to get it fixed . " " There was something funny about this accident , " said the chief darkly and returned to his pinochle game , after a telephone call . For a week , not one Allover Caravan was sold . This fact Fred conveyed to Hazel , who protested : " Why , you absolute pirate ! I thought you 'd reformed ! " " Look here ! I tried to reform . I tried to go off on a pilgrimage and become a better and tenderer man , and my two brats objected . Can I help it ? " Mr Putnam Staybridge telephoned to Mr Frederick Cornplow : " 1Jh , I thought you might just possibly be interested to know that the Conqueror agency , or so I am informed , intend to reduce their advertising for Allover Caravans to , uh , to approximately the same space used for Duplexes . " " Thanks , " said Fred . He removed the show trailer , and McKuffec 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kindness could not stir up a proper sale of Allovers . Hazel sighed , " Well , now you 've had another big success , I suppose you 've got your teeth in it so firm that you and I 'll never be running off together again . " " You mean it ? You 'd like to ? " " I think so . "  | THE SCENE WAS , for Fred , too fragile and artificial for comfort , yet he admired its gaiety : the club tennis courts , the white cement , the green balls flying , and the young people in white , young men with blue and crimson scarves above white shirts , girls with white shorts and honey-colored legs , all against hills flamboyantwith late September . He particularly liked the tall umpire 's chair , now empty . To be perched up there , above the conflict yet close to it and dominating it , would be kingly , he explained to Walter Lindbeck . " Awful . I knew a fellow got a tennis ball in his eye just when Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued Walter . Mr Walter Lindbeck , junior partner by inheritance of the large department store of Swazey &; Lindbeck , was fifteen or sixteen years younger than Fred , but he had by chance , on a fishing trip , become one of Fred 's intimates . Though he had gone to a large university and spent a year abroad in fruitfully doing nothing , Walter had , in Sachem , the high moral rank of : " steadyp202but progressive ; a fine , conservative , forward-lookingyoung fella , and got no bad habits even if he is a it bachelor . " He belonged to a chess club , but he also rode horseback ; he went annually to New York City for the grand opera , but it was said that at the S. &; L. Employees ' Association he played pool with the elevator men and packers . Altogether , a high type of the youngishcaptain of commerce , though Sara sniffed that with a man like Mr Lindbcck , whose thin face , and a black mustache small and neat as a cigarette , looked poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested only in sales leaders and invoices . Fred and Lindbeck had done eighteen holes of golf , and after a quick one , they relaxed by watching Sara play tennis . Fred was proud of her feverish speed  --  even prouder than of his new waist-pleated slacks . She was opposing a dull-faced dumpy girl of eighteen who played with the efficiency of a chopping knife . The girl lacked all of Sara 's dramatic gestures and elegant backhands ; her serves just missed the net and dropped dead before Sara could reach them , though she galloped in like the Light Brigade . In grieved wrath , Sara threw down her racket and screamed , " Ca n't you put some fun into the game , Daugherty ? We 're not digging ditches 1 " " Tst ! Tst 1 Tst 1 " Fred clucked . " Sara ought n't to lose her temper that way . " Walter Lindbeck sounded partisan . " I do n't blame her a bit . I 've played that Daugherty girl . She 's like lard ; just plays to win , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Tell me , Fred , whyp203the dickens did she ever get mixed up with this communistsheet ? Does n't believe all that stuff , does she ? " " I do n't think so . But we 've got to admit , way things are now , the young folks and the working men are demandingmore say , and you ca n't blame ' em entirely . " " That 's so . " Both men exhibited almost frightened admiration of their liberalism . " Tell you , Walter , trouble with Sara is , she has n't got enough to do , and she 's got too much brains and energy to just stick around . She 'd like to follow the tennis tournaments to Bermuda and Florida this winter , but I ca n't afford it . Say , I 've got an inspiration ! She 's got a great eye for colors and all that junk . Why do n't you give her a job in your interior-decorating department ? If there 's any way you could fix it in your accounting , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred bucks , provided she never knew it . She 's so doggone proud she would n't take a job like that if she found out I 'd rigged it . " " Oh , that would n't be necessary . Matter of fact , we do need a little new blood in the decorating department . Old Mrs Vix is about the period of Edward the Seventh , and I always did think Sara had a lot of dash and go . I 'd be glad to try her , if she was interested . " " She would n't touch it , if she thought I 'd butted in . You know how touchy all these blasted young people are today . If you 're interested , too  --  and I ca n't tell you how much I appreciate it  --  let 's get her to sell herself to you . " When Sara had finished her act , Fred beckoned , andp204she strode up cavalierly to sit between the two ancients . ( Lindbeck was thirteen years her senior . ) " Did n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sara . " " Oh , she 's the dumbest cluck in the club ! It 's like playing with a steam roller . " Lindbeck bubbled , " I agree . " Fred chattered , " I seem to be the only cheerful guy here today , in all this lovely fall weather , with the maples turning . Walter 's been kicking because he ca n't find the right person to put some pep in his foolish **25;5393;TOOLONG department  --  somebody that knows the local swells with money to spend and that has got an artistic eye for design . Do n't suppose you 'd pay real money for the job , Walter ? " " Not at first . Twenty a week for a start , with a small commission . But there would n't be any limit on the future , and the right man , or possibly it might be a woman , might work up to ten thousand a year or more . I 'm not looking for an ex-charwoman , or on the other hand for some tired lily that think he 's arty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knowledge of the history of art and with a lot of energy and sense Fred was amused , then a trifle guilty , to see the way in which Sara turned on Lindbeck her full flashlight : " Funny you should speak of that , Mr Lindbeck l I 've always been so interested in both painting and furniture and , in a modest way of course , I think I know quite a little about them . I have some ideas about decorating It seems to me that people are stupid in justusing chromium and red leather and mirrors andp205rounded corners , so that every room that calls itself moderne ' looks like a cafe . I think you could take Biedermeyer models and Duncan Phyfe motifs and modernize them so that they 'd be original , and do so many unconventional things with concealed light-ing " Yes , yes , that 's so . Would you like to drop into my office tomorrow and talk with Mr Swazey and myself ? " As they drove back home , Sara babbled to her parent , " I talked Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking about a job . I just talked about decoration in general , as though I had n't the slightest notion of going to work , and he , the poor little man , thought it was all his own precious idea , getting me to accept a position . I think I might like it . Decorating , in this dull town  --  why , I can do it on my head , and please the stupid plutocrats like the Praggs almost to death ! Father , my darling , you 're always fussing about me , but you would n't have thought of a career like this for me in a thousand years , now would you ! " " That 's so , " said Fred . For two weeks he rarely saw her , so absorbed was she in her new job of plotting against every innocent rocker and club chair left in town ; for two weeks he had peace ; but on a day just after the two weeks ' truce , he came home from the office to find Sara , triumphant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lookingmysteriously into the living room . " What 's all the excitement ? "  | " I tell you , he wo n't like it ! " said Hazel . " He will as soon as he gets used to it . If my own family ca n't appreciate creative ideas , how can you expectanybody else to ? " said Sara . " Where 's the fire ? " said Fred . " Look at it , and do n't blame me . . . . It is pretty lovely though .... I think I 'd come to like it a lot , " said Hazel , waving her hand in the direction of the living room and standing aside . The room had been magicked . Gone were all the pieces of furniture that to Fred meant home and security ; gone was his sacred , rather shabby , rather faded red armchair , in which , alone , the evening paper tasted right ; gone the couch on which , ritually , Hazel and he had listened to the radio side by side ; gone the MaxfieldParrish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile of magazines on a table with dragons ' feet clasping glass balls ; gone the stuffed head of the deer he had ( illegally ) shot in Quebec ; gone was everything that made home stuffy , ugly and lovable . Sara had redecorated the room in plum color and dull gold , rich as mince pie and somber as the thoughts of a defeated congressman . The furniture was dethronedLouis Quinze . And on the walls , replacing a nest of cheerful photographs showing Hazel with a watering pot , Fred in wading boots , complete with shotgun , Howard with a toy wagon , and Sara reciting James Whitcomb Riley , was one lone painting of the Towers of Rouen , which towers , taken jointly , resembled a fish fork.  | " Is n't it distinguished ! Has n't it real dignity ! " bubbledSara . " I did n't  --  I do n't " endeavored Fred . " It 's just on trial , of course . " " Well , it 's certainly swell , but I do n't think it quite suits your mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the treacherous Hazel , all the fanatical love of possessions in her eyes . " Look , Father ; if one 's own people do n't back you up , how can you expect me to make a career with other people ? " He was warning himself , " She 's got some reason . You were asking for it , Freddie . " He temporized , " If I did decide I liked the room , when I got used to it , how much would all this set me back ? " " I can do it for nineteen hundred dollars , Father . " " Ouch ! " said Fred , but feebly , as he turned for comfort to Hazel , saw her acquisitive glow and knew that he was sold . " We-11 , I could n't possibly pay it all in a lump . " So , for Fredk Wm , his home was turned into a house ; and a house was easier to leave than was a home.  | COLD HAM , **26;5420;TOOLONG salad , scallopedpotatoes , tea , beer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornplow family supper again , with Cornplow family food , at Howard 's flat . Before supper , Howard and he had what Fred would have called  --  would have called ? He did call it that !  --  a heart-to-heart talk , taking refuge in the bedroom from the bustling domesticity of Hazel and Annabel and the stateliness with which Sara sat and read the New Yorker . Not in the four and a half months since the firm of Bogey &; Cornplow had been founded had they been out of the red . It was only slightly irritating to Fred to go on contributing , but it was disturbing to have Howard expect advice on every contract , expect him to lure to the Bogey &; Cornplow office every prosperous person Fred met in agency or club or church . Howard was gushing , " Dad , I think you 'll agree with me  | " Rarely ! " "  --  that if I 'm going to rent and build swell houses , I 've got to prove my standing and show my good taste --  " Your what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not in this dump . " " What d ' you mean dump ' ? Wish you could 've seen the four-room shack that your mother and I had when we were first married . Only stoves , and no bathroom , just outdoor service . I tell you , in those days a real man was glad to shovel coal and lug the doggone ashes , instead of just moving a lever with one finger . We had oilcloth on the table . And , " Fred added , without great originality , " guess we were just about as happy as the young folks today , that expect to start in where their folks left off ! " " Um  --  yes . But I want you to look at this as an investment . I know where I can get a dandy , up-to-date modern house , six and a half rooms , for a hundred and ten a month , and then I can take prospects home for dinner . I want you to understand , Dad , I 've turned over an entirely new leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as you or Paul Popple ever were . I do n't even take a single drink  --  oh , maybe just a cocktail beforedinner " Or maybe two ? " " Well , of course , if there 's a dividend left in the shaker , there 's no sense wasting it " Son , if you expect me to put up the hundred and ten a month for your rent , I 'm simply not going to dop210it , do you hear me , wo n't do it , simply wo n't do it , do you understand , and that 's flat ! " Privately , he hoped it was flat . All through supper Howard seemed to have the hives . He kept winking at Annabel , clucking at her , and once he reached out and tenderly slapped her hand . There seemed to be nothing in the conversation to stir up such fervor . It consisted in Sara 's detailed account of wishing a bedroom in powder blue and crocus yellow upon Mrs Kamerkink , Howard 's speculation as to whether he could " interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Annabel 's dutiful plea to Hazel for the name of her hairdresser . Yet I Toward was certainly exhilarated , and after the ice cream he pounded the table and gave tongue : " I 've got a very important announcement to make . ... Now , Bell , do n't blush ! " " I do n't intend to I " said Annabel , blushing . " Mother and Dad , along about next March , you are going to have your first lovely little grandchild  --  and you , your first nephew , sister ! " " Oh , Howard  --  flnnabel ! " said Hazel . " Heh ? Oh . You mean you 're going to have a baby ? Fine , " said Fred . " Yessir ! " Howard roared . " And if it 's a son , and I 've got a good strong hunch it will be , I 'm going to name him " " Heh ! I 'm in on this , too , are n't I ? ' Wo n't I be related to the infant ? " protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Howard . IIe was indulgent about it , too . " He 's going to be called Little Nero , no matter what 's entered in the registry . I 've always wanted to name a child Little Nero . ' It may take the curse off him . " " Well now , Bell , you just forget that silly idea , and keep your little head clear for action . But Dad and Mother , there 's another point to this announcement that I do n't want you to forget . Because now , Dad  --  hard luck , old man , but that 's the way life goes !  --  you 'll have to help me make a great place in the world for the little cuss ! Your grandson ! " Annabel was snappish : " I do n't see why Father Cornplow should do any such a fool thing ! He 's not responsiblefor our having Little Nero " I simply do not like that nickname , even joking . " "  --  and how about your doing a little **25;5448;TOOLONG ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is in the worst possible taste . And at such a moment 1 " Howard was stern but refined . " If you could n't find jobs But , you great , big , darling , beautiful , dumb Greek god , you and all your vintage have the chronic gimmes . " " That will do , Bell , and if it were n't for your con-dition " Just the gimmes , that 's all ; just the plain oldfashionedgimmes ! " " Annabel ! " " And that 's why I 'm going to call him Little Nero , so he wo n't grow up to have the gimmes too , and expect you to stick at work  --  I mean , go to work  --  for him at seventy ! " " I 've never heard you talk such beastly nonsense before ! What can Father and Mother Cornplow be thinking of you ! " Howard turned grandly upon his parents . " At least , you 're glad the baby is coming , are n't you , Mammy ? " " Oh , simply delighted , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Just the gimmes , " chirped that lady , so beatifically that Fred wondered if she had sneaked in a couple of drinks before supper . Ile decided that she had had no such luck . No . The sound of Howard 's mellifluous optimism , day by ( lay , would in itself produce spontaneous intoxication accompanied by tremor and slight delirium . " And you , Dad , you 're glad , too , are n't you ? " insistedl Inward . " Why , of course ! Tickled to death . Lit -- I mean , our first little grandchild ! Gracious ! " " Swell ! " said Sara mechanically . " But you look here , I Inward . Do n't you go and get the idea you 're the only one Father has to look out for . With the good luck I 've been having , I would n't wonder if I did n't start a decorating shop of my own , and of course it would have to be financed . Of course . But congratulationsand all that sort of thing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't you ? " hinted Hazel , back home . " What baby ? " " Howard 's baby . " THE PRODIGAL PARENTS 213 " ' Tai n't Howard 's baby . He 's just an accident . " " Well then , our coming grandchild . " " Oh , I guess so . May be kind of hard on Little Nero himself " I do n't think it 's nice "  --  but it will amuse Annabel , and it will be swell for Howard . Think of what a chance he 'll have now to go swelling around being guide , philosopher and friend to the defenseless kid ! There is one thing . You know how often the pendulum swings back to the grandparents . Maybe Little Nero will have some of our independence , and not be a fathead like his father . " " Why , Fred ! Who ever heard or imagined grandparentsnot being just pleased to death at the coming of their first grandchild ! " " Well , I am pleased . Do n't get me wrong . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've read about grandchildren that did n't spend any too much time longing to support their grandparents , have n't you ? " " I suppose so . " " Why should n't it more or less work both ways ? You know Howard darned well meant it when he hinted he expected us to drop any personal plans we might have and stick around and nurse the royal heir . " " Ye-es . " " And you know , do n't you , that if we do stick around , he 'll probably make u J do anything he wants us to  --  there not being any more powerful influence on God 's green earth than the smile that wins , when it 's got a bottom layer of good , sticky self-approval . He 'll be too strong for us , and too dumb . So we better not stick around . Ai n't there something to what I say ? Ai n't there ? " " Urn  --  anyway , it really is a little too much , expecting you to support four generations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You helped your father pay off his mortgage when you were a traveling man , did n't you ? And you helped your sister start her dressmaking business " How that would grind Putnam Staybridge 1 Aristocraticto wear swell dresses , but low-class to make ' cm . " " And you certainly have always supported your own self since you were a brat  --  and I 'll bet you were a brat , too ! No , I do n't bet any such thing . I bet you were a cute baby . " " I do n't know about when I was a baby , but ' long ' bout six-seven , I was such a fat , sweet-looking kid , with long curls , that I had to lick the everlastin ' daylights out of about one neighboring kid per day , to keep my standing . Golly  --  I hope Sara do n't come in on us , but that certainly does feel better . " They were on the new settee in the living room , the radio turned on so low that it emitted only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but amid all this refinement , Fred had sighingly removed his shoes . " Well , you and your sister make a second generation you 've supported . And you certainly saw Howard and Sara through everything . And now , apparently , Howardexpects you to be responsible for this fourth generation  --  LittleNero . It 's a little too much . " " Maybe that 's so , " and Fred looked upon her withp215such lovelight in his eyes as not even eighteen holes in seventy-five could have set there . " I would n't mind supportingLittle Nero . I just hate to think about his being brought up to correct all my breaks . " " Well , if Little Nero is really our sort , he 'd rather have a high-stepping , jolly , independent old grandfatherthan a reservoir ! " That night , remembering Howard 's old contention that he was fast in the handcuffs of routine , Fred so far flaunted the ritual of fetishism as to throw his shirt on the floor instead of , as was his compulsion , hanging it smoothly over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazel picked it up . She supposed that it was a shirt that had been flung down , and not the strait-jacket of timidity . P216ALI . HIIS LIFE UNTIL NOW , night had been to FrederickWilliam Cornplow only a blank of sleep . Even as a traveling salesman , thirty years ago , waiting at vile junction depots till after midnight or snoozing on bumpy branch trains , though he might have had but six hours ' sleep , it had been profound . Now he took worries to bed with him ; they cuddled up beside him when he retired , then laughed and bit him . As long as he tried to lie still , he went tediously over and over his frets : Howard 's extravagance ; the probability that he would not support Little Nero and the certainty that he would grieve young Annabel . Sara 's new job , in which she would spare him and his pocketbook no more than she would spare herself . Hazel 's alternation between miserly pride in adornmentand a desire to see what the world was like . Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wonder whether , if he left them to themselves , Paul and Howard would be forced to become dependable , or simply break . P217Always , his own timidity and his meager learning . Worst of all , the neighborhood opinion which kept him a steady and commonplace little citizen : the opinion of Dr Kamerkink , Ed Appletree , the lawyer , even of Walter Lindbeck , that he would be a fool to do anythingsave settle inoffensively into old age . He saw that most of us do what most of the people about us mostly expect us to do , become brave or criminal or both , and he knew definite fear of the compulsion upon him to remain safe and dreary , a compulsion which could be escaped only by running awayRunning where ? For what ? But when he sprang up from bed , scoffing at the need of sleep , then night became an adventure ; sometimes wry , sometimes dismaying , always an excitement . He sat trying not to disturb Hazel , or he crept down to make coffee for himself and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stonefield and the cottage William Tyler Longwhale . That elopement had proved that he could get along , be amused , without the crutch of daily industriousness which his friends so recommended . Hazel was conscious of his rebellion and sometimes cocked a drowsy eye at him as he crept out of the room , but she guessed that he wanted to be left alone . Sara was conscious of it  --  she was a night prowler herself  --  but for a time he avoided her probing . In this unearthly second life he did n't always brood . Sometimes he read , soaked himself in the oddest magazinearticles and in books stolen from Sara 's shelves : articles about Javanese coffee culture , dialects in Burma , the roof of Ely Cathedral , Cycling in Tanganyikawith Notes on Hotels in Dar es Salaam . He laid the magazine down to dream out one-dimensioned pictureswoven of colored cloud : Pike 's Peak in the sun , bell towers of Bruges , himself playing the piano in an English cottage , himself chatty at the counter of the general store in Stonefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most embarrassing of all were the nights when he did not lie awake , when the worries treacherously let him go to sleep , then woke him jeeringly at three o'clock or four or five . It was cold downstairs then , even when it was n't cold . This November morning , at four-thirty , he knew that he was caught and would not sleep again until an hour at which a responsible man would be brightly awakening . He bundled himself up grotesquely : sweater as well as dressing gown , with an old golf stocking about his neck . The house was so still that it was noisy with creeping burglars . He looked out of a window and shivered . The street was bitterly empty ; the pavements , and a fire plug that should have been a lively red but was now gray , seemed lonely . He sat in the kitchen , at the metal-topped table , an illicit cup of coffee and a folder showing the Australian airlines before him . He startled at distant shuffling feet , the creak of the swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beamed with comfort as Sara'sP219face , sharpened with weariness , came peering at him . She smiled , and she sounded genial : " Why , you disreputable old tramp ! Could n't you sleep ? Neither could I. " Sara tucked the ridiculous golf stocking in about his neck , she clucked at him and kissed his ear . She seemed more truly his little girl than since she had been a lanky child . She sat opposite him , chin in hand , and said softly , " This insomnia is the worst idea I ever met . I 've got some little pills for it . Do n't you want some ? " " No indeed . " " But you 've got to sleep ! " " Why ? What 's the difference , as long as you get rest ? The need for sleep is kind of a superstition . I enjoy breaking up my old routine . And besides , I do n't want to get this little pill habit . " " Mine are n't habit-forming , not a bit . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all to make you sleep , is habit-forming . Do n't get to depend on it , sweetie . " The whole hour , the empty hour that was neither night nor day , seemed to him strange as Sara 's abnormalkindness . He was too listless for self-defense , and thus was he betrayed into honesty . Sara hinted , a little more sharply : " Curious , you , of all people , ca n't sleep . Worried , Father ? " " No , not exactly . " " I noticed you were reading a lot of travel stuff Do you still want to retire and go places ? " " Maybe . Sort of . "   " But you would n't really go to Europe , would you , or some other place far off from us ? " " Well , thunder , if you 're going to make a break , might 's well make a good one . No particular novelty for me , going out to the club for golf ! " " It 'd be fierce for me if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . " " Why ?

Ilc 's the kind that reads books about How to Sell , and gets so busy rushing out and selling that he never takes time to find out what he 's going to sell . " " But why do you worry so ? You 're smart enough . You 're making a go of this decoration thing . " " But if T start my own shop , I 'd never get away with it without your help . " " Then why start it ? You got a good boss in Walter Lindheck . " " Yes , he 's kind of a nice little man .

But practically , I guess I'veP221got too much Cornplow and Jenkins in me , doggone it . ... Heavens ! I 'm talking just like you ! " " What 's the matter with talking like me ? I always do ! " " Not always , darling . Sometimes you forget yourself and become quite literate . " " Well , I did more or less go to college , and recent years , I 've been brought up on luncheon-club oratory : Fellow members , real and enduring prosperity lies in the abandonment of the antiquated ethic of every guy for himself .

If instead of riding off in all directions at once , like Leacock 's hero , you would relax and go to some place where the doctors are accustomed to advise people and help them to get into shape " Fred was angry now : " Get in shape ' ! Get well ' ! Good Lord , girl !

Honestly , the help a man like Dr Janissarycould give you in re-education , by constructive personalconferences " I do n't know the gent . Maybe he might re-educate me into being some kind of a tabby cat I would n't want to be . Yes , there 's something I am getting well from , all right : from crawling along through life and being doped by routine . But Howard and you never thought that was a disease . You thought it was pretty convenientfor you ! " " Oh , Father , to talk like that  --  if Dr Janissary heard you !  --  to make us out monsters " You 're not , of course . But neither am I. We 're just normal people , up to the oldest trick in the world : naggingyour relatives for nagging you . I did n't want to be rude , girl . But get right over this idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself from a Parent into a Human Being . Good night  --  uh  --  good morning ! " So Fred clumped up to bed , with the intention of lying awake to lick his parental wounds , and went to sleep blissfully and at once . Bclowstairs , Sara was still in the kitchen , vowing , " Ilis idea of leaving us in the lurch  --  it 's insane  --  it 's beastly  --  and now I 've got to do something about it ! " P225HERE IS NO WAY in which a normally stubborn husbandcan more fruitfully surprise and annoy his loved ones than by being a " good patient , " which means a man who brightly agrees with the family doctor even when the doctor is n't sure that he agrees with himself . Another technical phrase that goes along with " good patient " is " worried about his health , " and it happened to Fredk Wm now that his wife decided to be worried about his health . " Do n't you think you ought to go to Dr Kamerkink and have a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saraless evening . He had watched her nervously approaching this bold position by way of chatter about a respected neighbor who , at eighty-one , probably from gross overuse of coffee , alcohol , tobacco and attendance on baseball games , had astounded the community by popping off . So Fred was ready for the attack and able to be genial : " Why ? "   " Oh , no special reason . I just think everybody past the advance of medicine , and proved that he had keptfifty ought to look after his health . " up , by grunting : " But not before fifty ? " " You 'll have to take a basal-metabolism test , and I " Wellofcoursebutimean want a blood count . " " My state of health been bothering anybody lately ? " " All right .

" " What 's the matter with old Fred ? " " So you 'll have to spend a night in a hospital . " " You know you do n't sleep right . " " O.K. " " If I can get along without sleep  --  and all through Dr Kamerkink was overwhelmed . Was Fred contheages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flask , or drugs , or a revolver ? Never in thesewaste of time there is  --  then I must be in swell shape ! " years of acquaintanceship had Fred given him any " I wish you would have Lafe Kamerkink look you reason to suppose that he could be so abnormal as toover . Please do . " act like a sane and normal patient . Doubtfully , wonder- " All right . I will . " ing when he would find the trick in it , Dr KamerkinkP227telephoned to engage Fred 's room in the hospital and " When ? " lighted a cigarette , prefatory to telling Fred about cut- " Next Saturday . " ting down the cigarettes . " I 'll be hanged ! " she said , unprophetically but withthe most gratifying astonishment . Fred liked his hospital room . He had declined Hazel'scompany and all offers of flowers and depressinglyAfter the usual assaults and embarrassments which cheerful bedside books . It was refreshing to have , withdoctorscall an examination , Dr Kamerkink illustrated out the penalty of pain , this simple room that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsely seemed to get itself cleaned with none of the horrors of hiring maids , seeing that they were transportedto the movies and otherwise entertained , and listening to the whine of their vacuum cleaners . The betterrooms in heaven must be automatic cells like this , he thought . They did let him undress himself and get into his fine small high bed without tender helping hands . The one thing he had feared , in contemplating this adventure , had been that with mocking jeers some pretty young nurse would snatch his protective clothes away and show him up as just a skinned rabbit . But he certainly had no intention , he assured himself , of missing any of his opportunity to be waited on . Hazel was fond enough of him , but Hazel would n't think at all well of bringing him cooling fruit juices all evening , and extra pillows , of smoothing the bedclothes if he was such a fool as to keep on violently turning over , or of listening to his oldest jokes , as did the floor nurse who  --  usually  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a splendid idea to have a call bell on the end of a cord , hanging beside his head . He wanted to introduce it at home , though he had the sanity to admit that he did n't know what would happen if he pressed it with any idea that it would influence Hedgar the Hun . He had heard ( though he was to discover that the tale was false , and told only to make the narrator seem heroic ) that in taking a basal-metabolism test he would find it difficult to breathe , and he had every intention ofp229enjoying himself by lying awake9and worrying about it . But in the pleasure of not having to wonder whether Howard would call up , late , or wonder at what time Sara would be coming home , he forgot about being insomniac , fell sweetly asleep at ten and awoke in daylightto find a keen young woman in white wheeling into his room what resembled a trench mortar polished up for the use of the crown prince . The floor nurse was chirping at Fred with the sugared cheerfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the technician . " Fred had time only to note that he ought to look into this fact that all hospital technicians were beautiful beforethe lady pinched his nose with a glorified clothespinand fitted over his amazed and protesting mouth a rubber apparatus through which , she told him coolly , he was to breathe . That breathing , it seemed , caused a polished plunger to rise up and down in the trench mortar . Instantly scared , but resolved to be gallant , he enjoyed fighting against choking , his body tense , his breath laboring . But he discovered that he was merely making things hard for himself . He quit being gallant and energetic , and therewith the breathing was as natural as though he stood on a hilltop , free of rubber gadgets and hospital beds . " Good man ! That 's fine , " said the technician . He was to treasure that commendation along with the highest distinctions he had known in life ; with the letter from the president of the Duplex company saying that his agency had the best credit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had a fairly accurate swing ; with the sigh of a very young Hazel that he had been so nice to her father ; with his election as vice-president of the Boosters ' Club ; and with the remark of his professor of rhetoric , back in Truxon , that his essay on The Character of Portia had n't been bad at all . He was still in the glow of this honor , and the rubber mask had been removed , when the technician , taking his hand tenderly , turned savage and jabbed into his finger a needle stuck in a cork . " Ouch ! " he wailed in protest . It was true that it had n't hurt , but he felt that the principle was very bad . Then he was asleep , before he could do anything about it ; and he awoke to a tray of ham and eggs , and to Dr Kamerkink by the bed , saying suspiciously , " Why , there does n't seem to be one darn thing the matter with you ! " " But did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Sara when , at home , Fred crowed over his superiority . P231IN ALL INNOCENCE AND GLEE , Fred was playing pokerat the residence of his friend and lawyer , Edward McTavishAppletree , and the conversation was hearty with humor : " By me . " " I 'll whoop you two . " Knock , knock . " What ' re you trying to do with that hooch , Ed  --  save it for your grandchildren ? " But he was also present , though not physically , in his own house , where Hazel , Sara , Howard , Annabel and Dr Kamerkink were sitting as comfortably as possible , which was n't very comfortably , on Louis Quinze . Sara was holding forth : " You may think I 'm absolutely silly , maybe a little melodramatic , in asking you to meet , but we 've really got to be serious and practical . I do n't mean Father is the least bit insane , of course , but I do feel he 's got some pretty queer ideas that might make him do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret . " " Oh , come down to cases . What 's so queer ? " fretted Hazel .   " These ideas about going off and being some kind of a John Ruskin , wandering around Europe studying art . Father 's one of the dearest , most dependable men living  --  or at least he has been  --  but even you , Mother , have got to admit that he can never be anything except a completely unimaginative small-city merchant ; and with all affection , we ought to keep him from making himself ridiculous . " They spoke together : " Only one of the whole lot of us that has imagination ! " from Annabel . " I think there 's a lot to what Sara says , " from Howard . " He 's never even pretended he wanted to go Ruskiningaround Europe , " from Hazel . " His euphoria does kind of puzzle me , " from Dr Kamcrkink . " I ns what ? Is that one of these things you take this to your druggist now and he 'll fill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Annabel . " Euphoria . State of gaiety and well-being . I do n't , " said the doctor resentfully , " see what the dickens Fred has got to be cheerful about ! " Sara took over the debate again : " I do n't want to be an alarmist . I suppose Father is perfectly all right , really . But you all know of cases where a man who has been a reliable husband and father has suddenly gone haywire , and at just about Father 's age , and started gambling or drinking or chasing women , and left his family ( " With all their gimmes , " murmured Annabel. )  | "  --  unprovided for : Of course Father has built up a good business , but you know what can happen to any business , these days , if the responsible head starts neglectingit . So far as I know , the only real safeguard any of his family has is Father 's fifty-thousand-dollar life insurance . Now I 'm the last person in the world to be grasping or dependent . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carve out their own destinies ; but at the same time , I have to make- a start . It 's not my fault if I have to have lots more training before I can achieve a great position and get my own shop . I 'm simply not going to let Father let me down ! Consideringthat we are , after all , the only people that Father depends on , if we stick together , he 'll just have to give up any ideas of ditching us . . . . And of course Howard'scareer also , I suppose , and your child coming , Annabel . " ( " Howard , is this true ? Why did n't you tell me ? " ) ( " Oh , shut up , Bell . " ) ( " Do you belong to the new race of men , beauti-ful ? " ) " Now I 'm sure Dr Kamerkink will back me up in saying that the comparatively new science of psychiatry has developed to a point where they can cure a twisted mind just as they cure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most wonderful psychiatrist in New York : Dr George Janissary . His patients look up to him with absolute reverence  --  and , mind you , they 're not a bunch of hysterical spinsters , but a lot of them are brokers and engineers and college professors and doctors , too . Why , ever so many of them come back to him every year . " Annabel snorted : " If a doctor cured my twisted foot but I had to go back every year , I 'd think he was a bum untwister . " " For heaven 's sake , Annabel , will you please permit me , at least , to be serious ? " ( " Butting in again . . . . Gimmes . " Annabel 's mutter was like the muted bark of a small dog that has been told to dry up . ) " I ventured to talk this all over with Dr Janissarywhen I was in New York on my last buying trip , and he says it would be a cinch  --  very common psychosis , mild delusions of grandeur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting well . " Through it all , though she had not glibly interrupted like Annabel , Hazel had looked shocked . She stammerednow , " B-but did this doctor make a diagnosis just from what you told him ? " " After all , a daughter , and living right in the same house with her father , ought to understand him , if she 's reasonably intelligent . " ( " If ! " from Annabel . ) Hazel struggled on , " I 'm perfectly certain you 're wrong . I 've never known your father clearer-headed . " " But you 'll admit , Mother , it would n't hurt Father to see Dr Janissary ? Were n't you glad when he had his general physical examination ? " " Ye-es . . . though he did crow so , afterwards 1 " " And what do you think , Doctor ? " Dr Kamerkink said benignly , " Well , I do n't sup/pose it would hurt Fred any , though I certainly do n't see any need , " but he barely got it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sara ! Listen to me for a moment  --  even if I am only your mother ! Strikes me this all comes down to how honest a man your Janissary person is . I 'm not so behind-the-times that I do n't know that psychiatry , or however you pronounce it , does do wonders ; helps ever so many people get straight what it is that 's worrying them . But to a lot of folks , and I confess I 'm one of ' em , it still seems a little like magic , and if they depended on a psychiatrist that was moneygrabbing , and if they thought he was an all-powerful medicine man , would n't it be dangerous ? Seems to me I have heard about American women going to Europeand getting into the clutches of fancy psycholo-gists ( " With whiskers ! " ) "  --  that got them all confused and milked ' em . " " Foreigners ? Yes , possibly . Foreigners are often crooked . But Dr Janissary is a real American . And he speaks five languages and plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing part sounds fine , " said Dr Kamerkink .   RED WAS FLATTERED to a point of grinning when Sara invited him to accompany her to New York City on a buying trip for Swaney &; Lindbeck . He accepted with zeal and with the notion that he would show the little girl a thing or two : the best restaurant in New York , and how a real salesman could order . He swallowedher statement that she wanted the aid of his common sense in buying furniture for game rooms  --  those assemblages of pool tables , card tables , private bars , and grills for cooking chops which were decidedly the thing in Sachem domestic architecture . But on the train she so buttered his good taste that , remembering the Louis Quinze into whose chill lap he had been enticed , he became suspicious . In the city he was so lulled by the toe-tapping music of " Kiss Me Quick , " so youthfully enchanted by an Italian cafe and by memories of the Paris boulevards which he had never seen , that he trusted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed gaily , next morning , when she invited , " Come along with me , will you ? I want you to meet such a nice man . "  |p237Their  taxicab stopped at an uptown apartment house . A chaste bronze sign in the lobby announced that the Janissary Sanitarium occupied Floors 7  --  10 Incl . &; Roof . Still was he gullible . . . . Some pleasant man living upstairs whom Sara had known in New York days , or met in this decoration game ? . . . Would he be married ? Oh , surely . . . . Would he have a handsomeflat ? . . . Would he offer Fred a drink , and would Fred take it , so early in the day ? . . . Prob-ably ! They entered a room which did n't in the least suggest a friendly flat , nor yet a drink . At first , indeed , it suggested nothing whatever to Fred except quantities of money . It seemed to be a combination of a baronial hall in the North Riding , an operating room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of a high oak Tudor fireplace were oak thrones , but at one end of the room , modestly , was a young woman in a white uniform at a desk of white-enameled metal , with a glass top , uncomfortably hinting of surgical knives . And the lulling voice with which she sang " Your names if you please ! " wafted the sweet fumes of ether . They waited ten minutes . " What the deuce are you up to ? " protested the aroused Fredk Wm . " I wanted you to meet Dr George Janissary , the psychiatrist  --  thegrandest man  --  you 'll love him . " " I doubt it . Somehow this shack he 's got here do n't seem to rouse any stirrings of love . Psychiatrist ? Mind doc ? " " You appreciate them , do n't you ? "  | " Of course . For those that need ' em . I do n't . I also do n't need a chiropodist or an aviator . " They argued in the most spirited manner , those ten minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in on his psychiatrist now and then , and find out what phobias , schizophrenic reactions , paranoid behaviors , or obsessive-compulsive neuroses he might have developed this past week . Fred said that , in his experience , if your carburetor is working right , do n't let any mechanic monkey with it . He could not have been expected to know that , in a psychologist 's or a psychiatrist 's office , the only person who is ever permitted to say " in my experience " is the healer . They were admitted then to the friendly presence of George Carlyon Janissary , B.A. , M.A. , M.D. , L.H.D. ; and Fred , who had come to expect a point-headed wizard in a black gown sprinkled with crimson stars , was relieved . Dr Janissary was a jolly , tweedish , sporting , lanky gentleman , with a long red mustache and sunbrownedhands . He smelled of heather , good pipe tobaccoand the best soap ; he shook hands merrily and spoke in baritone : " I do n't really know why you 're here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of an idea that I might be able to advise you on how to get the most fun out of your retiring  --  great idea , retiring ; majority of us keep our noses to the grindstone too long . Just as you might advise me about buying an automobile . " This was fine.  |p239Fred  beamed . Sara beamed . Dr Janissary beamed more than twice as much as both of them put together . But he somewhat less suggested golf courses and the fishing camp on the Ouareau River as he reached for a handful of filing cards and demanded : " What was the date of your birth ? " " What was the calling of your father  --  his fatherhis mother 's father  --  their financial condition ? " " What do you believe to be your ambition in life ? " " Do you usually consider yourself passionate orfrigid by nature ? " " Have you any hobby  --  any interest outside of makingmoney and caring for your family ? " Till this point , Fred had been too hypnotized to do anything but answer meekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Say , what 's the idea of all this , anyway ? Sara , have you signed up for my giving a lecture on my life and adventures ? And who pays who for it ? " Dr Janissary did not think this was in the least funny  --  for that matter , Fred did n't think it was so very funny himself . The doctor was grave and warning : " Mr Cornplow , from what Sara has told me and from what I have already observed , it is clear that you have lost grip  --  oh , just the least bit ; nothing that ca n't readily be corrected by psychobiologic reeducation . Lost grip on your personal affairs . Do n't be frightened . " " I 'm not ! " " That 's splendid . It happens to the most competent men of affairs , sometimes , from exhaustion and worry . I 'm quite sure that your hallucination about being an explorer is temporary . Quite a satisfactory prognosis , I should think . Your only real danger is the practical one that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be led into extravagances that would dissipate your entire small fortune . But of course , my dear fellow , you 're not even sure that you want us to do our modest best for you , as yet . Do let me show you our place here  --  our plant ' you would no doubt call it . Fred had swung between amusement and exasperationtill now , but he found nothing amusing at all in the four floors and roof which made up the sanitarium . The bedrooms , though small , were bright enough with red-and-yellow upholstery , and there were no bars on the windows , but the corridors smelled of drugs , and he saw a male attendant , a shaved gorilla , standing in a niche , watchfully looking up and down a corridor  --  up and down , with surly slowness . His forearms , revealed by the cut-off sleeves of his white jacket , were strong and horribly well scrubbed . Half a floor was given over to the workshop activitieswhich Dr Janissary called Occupational Therapy , Dr Kamerkink called Hobbies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for basket making , model-boat making , carpentry and knitting , and there , most busily knitting , was , to Fred 's embarrassment , an aged gentleman with a white beard .   " Knitting ? " said Fred . " Yes , it 's so soothing . Very recreational . Last year we had an ex-United States senator here , seventy years old , and he knitted a sweater for his wife . " " What she do with it ? Give it to her gigolo or to the Salvation Army ? " said Fred . In the light of Sara 's look of affliction , Janissary 's look of pain , he warned himself he was nothing but an upstate hick and must n't annoy these sophisticates with his rustic American jeers . He wanted to , but did n't , ask whether men patients got well because they knitted , or got sick in the first place because they were the kind that would knit . He fell into low humor once more when Dr Janissary had showed them the roof of the building , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was n't so much , thought Fred . Besides the graveled roofing , parallel bars and a few deck chairs , forlorn under Decembersky , it exhibited no entertaining features save a view of the Hudson and a brewery across it , and a high woven-wire fence . Before Fred could check his unfortunatehumor , he had demanded , " What 's fence for ? Keep the nuts from jumping off ? " Dr Janissary did not answer , but so queerly did he glance at Sara that Fred felt boorish . He looked about the roof , trying to think of something agreeable to say . A few feet behind him , the same male attendant was standing , rigid , his arms folded . ( Now the truth is that the attendant was not followingFred . He had sneaked up to the roof for an illegal cigarette . But it is a principle known to soldiers that it is as bad to be frightened to death as it is to be killed . ) As they descended from the roof , Sara said , and her tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that 's a lovely fresh-air nook ? " " A nook ! " was all that Fred could get out . He really spoke up when they were back in Dr Janissary 's office : " Well , Doctor , I 'm glad to have seen your shop . I 'm sure you could do a lot for people who are disturbedand puzzled . But I hope you do n't think any of this is for me ! Nosir I Well , Sara , let 's skip back to the hotel . " But Dr Janissary would not let him go . Presumably there was no law by which he could force Fred to sit there , sweating , yet Fred felt as though a couple of deputies stood behind his chair , ready to spring , while the doctor said amiably : " I 'm afraid you 're not entirely original or unusual , Mr Cornplow , in thinking that while we could do something for the other fellow , you 're too clear-headed and self-analytical for us to do anything for you . What we strive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand themselves . People have so many blind spots in their mental steering vision . " Bluntly , " You got any blind spots , too , Doc ? " He felt slightly astonished that Janissary neither hit him nor called for handcuffs , but merely hesitated , " Oh yes  --  yes , of course . " " So we can call it quits , eh , Doc ? " ( Within , " WhyP243ca n't you be refined with these highbrows , Fred , and not try to jolly ' em the way you would Cal Tillery ? " ) " Because I certainly hope neither you nor Sara have any idea I 'd ever let myself be cooped up here and have somebody try to ' do some constructive psychiatric work ' with me , as I believe you call it . " Dr Janissary did not , thereafter , sound so tolerant as one would have expected in a teacher of toleration : " About your condition , my dear Mr Cornplow , " ( " I 'll be everlastingly doggoned if I 'll let any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) " there can be no question whatever . You are suffering from disassociation and a toxic condition probably due to drug escapism . And , to scotch one of the commonest lay errors , no one can do anything permanent by the use of his own so-called will power . ' You need the help of trained experts . " " You mean nobody at all can get in shape by his own will power ? " " Oh , there are apparent exceptions . " " And maybe I 'm an exception ! And maybe there 's more ' n you think . Because sensible people do n't worry too much about worrying . And maybe a lot of ' em steer clear of you . So , Sara , let 's beat it . " " Mr Cornplow , let me say , at this amiable parting , that in a way I agree with you in your own diagnosis . " " Eh ? What 's wrong with it , then ? " " I would n't consider taking your case unless I had complete authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you suffer from the very common complaint of thinking you know as much as the doctor !  --  unless you agreed to stay under control for , at the least , six months . " " Six Sara ! We 're going . " He had no farewell for the doctor . In the receptionroom , the white-clad secretary said tenderly , " It will be one hundred dollars for the consultation , please , and if you do n't mind , with new cases the doctor would prefer cash . " Fred choked a little before chuckling ( and it was his only chuckle of the clay ) , " This young lady will pay . She brought the Case here . He ca n't . He has a Condition ! " At the lower door of the apartment house , he said , " Get this straight , Sara . I do n't blame Janissary . I blame you and whatever you 've been telling him . You take a taxi . I 'm going to walk . And I sha n't see you in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Sha n't see you again . No ! " P245ON THE NOON TRAIN to Sachem there was a celebratedlecturer who beguiled the tedium by analyzing the people he saw along the way . He devoted only one glance to Fred Cornplow , sitting in dumpy stiffness in his Pullman chair . There he was , merely a round little man with a round little head and half-round little mustacheand round little hands , his fingers tapping with slow regularity on the side of a folded magazine , his glance straight ahead and uncommunicative . Obviously a petty business man , too unimaginative , too regimented , too incapable of strange sorrows and of fierce achievement , to be worthy the contemplation of a celebrated lecturer who , only eight hours from now , would be explaining to an audience with nice clean shirts and nice earnest smiles that life would be ever so much more amusing if you trained your eyes . Fred had heard , as something that might happen to people whom you never met , that there had been cases in which entirely sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog . Row upon row of heavy volumes filled the shelves , and the great mahogany desk stood in the center . It was a flat-topped desk , and at each corner a fierce dog 's head had been carved . The lifelike expression of their bared fangs was hardly reassuring to Henriette as she seated herself near by . Neither were the bundles of papers the old man had been studying . An open letter also lay under his hands , and it took only a hurried glance for her to recognize the writing . She did not let her eyes linger there , but spreading her dimity skirt carefully about her she waited for him to speak . " I am not going to mince words with you , mademoiselle , " he began in his rather thick , provincial voice . " I 've been greatly disturbed by what has come to me in the post . " He cleared his throat and fumbled among the papers before him . As he did so Henriette saw the familiar lines of red drawn about certain paragraphs , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her mother , " she remarked to fill in the pause . She was determined to remain casual as long as possible . " She tells me that Madame la Duchesse is recovering from her indisposition in the country . " " She is at the chateau , yes ; but , far from being recovered , she is apparently in a state of collapse . You will see why when you read what she has sent . " He took up the sheaf of newspapers and laid them in her lap . " It has been a great shock to me , a very great shock indeed . " She took the papers up resolutely and  --  began to read . It was very quiet in the room , so quiet that a bee buzzing on the windowsill and the distant thud of surf below the headlands made the very stillness hum . She did not skip a word , though they were ugly words and there were many more of them than in their forerunner . Not one , but several papers carried versions of the latest Praslin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the guise of governess , had played in carrying the Duc off to Corsica , into the very stronghold of the abandoned Duchesse , was commentedp201upon fully . Few who read Parisian newspapers could have missed the various maliciously worded items , and this time there were no clever insinuations , but bold statements . What , one paper asked , was the country coming to when a Peer of France could so affront the code of family ethics ? Henriette laid the sheaf down at last and faced the old Marechaldirectly . She had turned pale , but that and the beating of the little pulse in her throat were the only signs of emotion . Her voice was low and steady as she spoke . " If you are shocked by this , how do you think I feel ? " " I do n't know , mademoiselle . I am waiting to hear . " She moistened dry lips and spread out her hands in a futile gesture . " Monsieur le Marechal , " she said , " there 's no use in explanationsand denials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week and in Paris also  --  if you believe that there is more than friendship between the Duc and myself , then nothing I might say could convince you otherwise . " He was unprepared for the simplicity of her answer . Used as he was to the tears and protests and frenzies of his hysterical ( laughter , he could have dealt better with wild pleas and expostulationsthan with the calm self-control of this woman who sat waiting for his verdict . " Mademoiselle , " he told her , " in all fairness I must admit that I do not believe these vulgar charges against you . All my life I 've been a man of action , and so for me actions speak louder than words . But words like these are very serious , as you yourself must realize . " " I do . It only takes a drop of poison to turn what is sound to something rotten and corrupt . You need n't point out to me that after this my reputation is gone . " " You should have thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duc to accompany you and so put yourselves and my poor daughter in such a position . Your indiscretionhas laid you open to these attacks , unjust though they mayp202be . And I understand there was a similar one , too , some months ago . " There was , and I was ready to leave at that time ; but then Bert he became so ill I stayed . After all I love your grandchildrenalmost as much as if they were my own , and I 've given them my best always . " " And afterwards ? " " Afterwards they still needed me , and the Duchesse was graciousto me once more . Oh , monsieur , please believe that I tried to go . Many times I have told the Duc that it was best , but he would never hear of it . " " My son-in-law is not always wise in his judgment , mademoiselle . He 's impetuous and easily swayed , far too easily swayed . " " When do you wish me to go ? Today , tomorrow ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . His stocky , vigorous body seemed charged with energy , despite his white hair and beard and the veined hands that betrayed his age . " We must not be too hasty . No , we must find the best way to quiet these insults . " " I 'm grateful for your consideration , monsieur . " His dark , filmed eyes turned upon her with a flash of the Corsicantemper she had learned to know so well . For a moment the resemblance between himself and the Duchesse was startling . " Keep your gratitude , mademoiselle . It 's my daughter I 'm considering , not you or the Duc . Her welfare is all that matters to me . God knows , it 's not in my power to give her much happiness ; but I mean to spare her all the humiliation I can . She 's had enough to bear . " Henriette pressed her lips firmly together and ventured no furthercomment . The old man continued his pacing , and it seemed the better part of an hour before he spoke again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , and that is to seem indifferent to gossip . They expect you to leave the Praslin household now , and the fact that you remain and apparently on excellent terms will help to contradict all this . "  | " Yes , monsieur . " She had not given him credit for so much astuteness . He really had more insight than she had suspected . " We must go on exactly as usual except , of course , that my son-in-law and my daughter must make it a point to be seen togethermore frequently in public . You will remain , and we will all return to France day after tomorrow . " " And you will explain to the Duchesse that I stayed at your request ? I want her to know that this decision is entirely yours . " " I will make her understand . Fanny has always been reasonablewith me . Yes , that will be the best course for us all to take . " He seemed relieved now that the decision had been made . Seating himself once more at the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for action . " I shall write them both at once , " he told her , " and dispatch the letters by special messenger to the next packet . They 'll reach France before us . The Duc must be made to remember his position , and that he can not humiliate his wife further . She has been pushed too far , mademoiselle , and as her father I shall find means to bring him to his senses . " His voice grew harsh , and he dipped his pen fiercely in the ink to express his feelings . Watching the hardening of his usually kind old face , Henriette knew that this retired officer still believed in force ; that he could still wage campaigns other than those of the battlefields he had known . Gunpowder , she thought , was not the only ammunition at his command . Mentally she could almost see Marechal Sebastiani tightening the cords of his money bags if his son-in-law refused to comply with his plans . " Well , " she reflected as she made her way from the musty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I am only more deeply caught . Mon Dieu , to see the end , to know what to do ! " Thinking that Berthe and Raynald were in the summer house at the end of the rose garden , she went out to find them . But she paused on her way , arrested by the sound of singing . In the kitchen garden the other side of a high hedge she heard the twanging of a guitar and a girl 's voice lifted in one of the plain/tive gypsy airs that never failed to stir a responsive chord in her . This was one she had not heard before , and the words came clear and distinct through the thick green that hid the singer : " I hung my heart on a blackthorn tree , For I was young and gay ; I feared that love would follow meAnd my poor heart betray . But who can guess what the end will be ? Love played me a bitter jestI dance , though my tears fall salt as the sea , I sing , with a thorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spot as if some invisible warning finger had tapped her on the shoulder . She was tremblinglong before the song ended . Chill shivers flickered along her spine though the sunshine beat down upon her bare head . Peering through a gap in the hedge she saw the two musicians , a young stable boy with his guitar and one of the girls from the laundry , bending over some linen spread out to bleach . To her own surprise Henriette found herself addressing the peasant girl who knelt there . " You were singing just now . No , I 'm not scolding . You have a very sweet voice . Can you tell me the name of that song ? " The pair turned from fright to foolish giggles of confusion . Still kneeling , the girl pushed back the red and yellow kerchief that covered her hair and answered shyly . " It 's a very old song , that one  --  too old to have a name . " " Is n't it rather a sad song ? " Henriette persisted by way of accountingfor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances . Evidentlyher remark amused them by its obviousness . " Well , yes . " The girl shrugged her shoulders eloquently . " But why not , mademoiselle ? It 's always sad when love makes people afraid . "  |p205She  hurried on along the path , but she could hear those two whispering and giggling behind her . " When love makes people afraid  --  it 's always sad . " Why had it taken a Corsican peasant girl to tell her what she had fought off admitting to herself ? 205p206IT WAS NEw YEAR 'S once more ; 1846 , and the papers predicting higher taxes , wider skirts , and further foreign alliances . Across the Channel , Great Britain under Sir Robert Peel 's ministry rocked with agitation over a repeal of the Corn Laws , and already the specter of famine stalked over Ireland . Shut away in a Londonparlor , an invalid poetess named Elizabeth Barrett thrilled to the visits of a certain Robert Browning , with whom she would flee to Italy before the year ended . In prison at Ham , Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late glories of his uncle and to speculate on the future while he waited to regain his freedom . He must be ready to step forward when his supporters should decide that the moment had come to strike at the House of Orleans . In his palace the tired , aging King of France conferred with his ministers and House of Peers . He missed a certain hearty ring in the cheers that greeted his public appearances , but the band played louder to cover the thinness of lifted voices . They called him Louis-Philippe now , and only a few remembered his old nickname of Citizen King . But he no longer bothered about that . It took all his energy to go through the motions expected of him . At least France was at peace , and her relations with England and the young Victoria and her German consort were extremely friendly . As for the rest , he left them to Guizot , his Minister of Foreign Affairs . In her room at the chateau of Choiseul-Praslin , Henriette Deluzy , who only occasionally remembered that the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Desportes , welcomed the New Year in alone . She had scarcely been in Paris since the return from Corsica . The old Marechal had kept his word , and a reconciliation of sorts had taken place . The Duc and Duchesse at/tended soirees and receptions together and were seen frequently driving and at the theater and opera . All the household , from grooms and kitchen maids up to the Duc 's valet , Charpentier , and the inscrutable Madame Leclerc knew this was a mere formality ; but at least it gave no further opportunity for items in the gossip sheets . The Marechal Sebastiani settled himself at Number 55 , Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor &; and two of his brothers with their large families resided near by . It seemed to Henriette that they had deliberatelyclosed in round the Duc , that he must literally feel engulfedwith Sebastiani relatives . She guessed that his every movement was being watched , and that his father-in-law had laid down his ultimatum . Certainly he seemed worried and preoccupiedwhenever she saw him . But he never mentioned such matters on the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dared not trust himself to speak of his despair . He had been trapped and humiliated ; and there seemed to be no way out but to submit , at least to the extent of keeping up the appearances of a happy marriage . Henriette could feel a greater tension in him . She did not believe that this outward domestic accord was more than a temporarystate . It was only an interlude , like the brief pause that followsthe breaking of one wave and the rising of the next . She , too , was caught in this unnatural quiet between storms . It was a strange and lonely time , but she almost welcomed it because of the illusion of peace it gave her . So , she thought , people must live through a siege , glad of sun and green leaves and such happy manifestations of the seasons , while their ears were ever on the alert for the rattle of shells that sent them scurrying for shelter . In a way the Duc 's absence was a relief , even though the days seemed savorless without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his every word and glance . She need not strain to catch the personalmeaning behind every inflection , or constantly try to give him sympathy without crossing that boundary which separated governess from married employer.  |p208Isabella  had been married in October . The ceremony haul taken place in the family chapel at the chateau in order that the DowagerDuchesse of Praslin might be present . The Abbe Gallard had journeyed from Paris to perform the rites . It had been a time of great rejoicing and felicity , and the members of both Praslin and Sehastiani houses forgot their grievances to lavish affection and good wishes upon the young bride and bridegroom . The chateau overflowed with relatives of all ages ; and Henriette found herself not only in charge of the young people but superintending the activities of the household , seeing that new servants were added to the staff , and that all the details connected with so important an event went smoothly . Her genius for directing others had never been given so large a scope , and she rose to the occasion magnificently . Even the Duchesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching . " It is nothing , " she had insisted the day after the wedding when he overwhelmed her with praise . " I love orderliness , monsieur . It hurts me to see disorder in a desk or drawer , and it is even more painful and unnecessary in the affairs of life . " " Yes , " he had told her , " you have a passion for order . You 've even brought it to the chaos of.my own life as well as the routine of my household . It 's a pity you ca n't take over the whole country . " He smiled and gave her one of his direct admiring glances . " I can almost see you going about it with your quiet air of pleased determination , sorting out the affairs of state , tidying all Paris as if it were an overturned work-basket ! " " You make fun of me , " she had protested . " I 'm really a very poor housekeeper . I may tell others what should be done , but if it were necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread  --  Well , we should all go hungry . " But she treasured his praise . And so it was New Year 's again , and she sat alone in her room trying to read from a beautifully bound book on the scenic wondersof America which the Duchesse had sent her as peace offer/ing at Christmas . She turned the pages idly , trying not to think of Paris at this hour with the bells and the lights and the boulevardsthronged with revelers , the churches warm with lights and incense where the devout raised prayers for the coming year . Louise , Celeste , and Marie had been privileged to sit up till midnight , and she had gone with them to wish their grandmother Happy New Year . The old Duchesse , grown increasingly frail in the last two years , they had found propped among her pillows , her fingers moving along her rosary beads while she waited for midnight to strike . When the last note of the clock had sounded she put aside her beads , kissed her granddaughters on either cheek , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the years ! " the old lady had sighed in response to Henriette'sgood wishes for her health . " For me they are not what they used to be . At my age one is forever walking backward , stumblingover souvenirs of the past , left by those who have already gone . Never pray for a multitude of years , mademoiselle , for it is not meant that we should be ghosts to haunt ourselves . " " You 're not a ghost , Grand'mere . " Louise had broken in with one of her impulsive embraces . " Is she , mademoiselle ? It 's going to be a wonderful year , and Papa says I shall be betrothed before another . " " Yes , you 'll be flying from the nest soon , my pet . " Her grandmother had laid her shriveled fingers to the fresh young cheek . " May you be happy , whether or not I live to hear you make your vows . The years come and the years go ; so enjoy them while you 're young and heart-free . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not help agreeing with Louise 's impatience at such familiar plaints . " Mademoiselle , " the girl had asked when they paused to say good night , " why do old people always talk as if you could be happy simply because you 're young ? " " I do n't know , " she had answered , " unless it 's because we for/get grief more easily than joy . Perhaps that 's the kindest trick memory can play on us when we 're old . But are n't you happy tonight , my dear ? " " Oh , 1 suppose so , only I miss Isabella ; and I keep wondering how she feels now she 's a married woman . All the time I wonder how it will be for me . I want things to happen soon ; and yet I 'm a little afraid , too . " Henriette had been reassuring , and they had parted affectionately . But alone by her sitting-room fire she could no longer fight oil dejection and restlessness . The frosty stillness of the country lying behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servants the companionship and good cheer they must be enjoyingin the chateau 's domestic quarters . She was not given to self-pity  --  she despised the trait in other people ; yet for once it threatened to overwhelm her . Tonight she rebelled at being alone . " Why should I be cursed with this loneliness ? " she thought . " Must I always be caught between two generations without a chance to know my own ? If I can not have love , at least I could take comfort in the companionship of those who think as I think , who feel as I feel . " The tears she so seldom gave way to , rose behind her eyes . She made no effort to check them , but let the salty rush have its way . " Yes , " she told herself , " it will always be this way . Always like tonight , you will stand between the old and the young , listening to sighs for the past and hopes for the future . You belong to the present , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over and what is waiting to begin  --  the old Duchesse whisperingto dead friends , and Louise with her untried schoolgirl heart ? " After her tears dried , she rose and went to her desk . She could not sleep , and since she longed to be in Paris she would distract her mind by writing to the few friends she had there who might even now be speaking her name  --  the kind Remeys , cantankerous Madame Le Maire , and another whose interest had lately come to mean much to her . She had met the Reverend Frederic Monodp211through the Protestant Church in Paris , which she attended whenever possible . Several times this brilliant writer on theologicalsubjects , this man whose eloquence and faith were as moving as the sure logic of his mind , had preached from that pulpit to a congregation that had been swayed by his power . After listening to one of these sermons Henriette had been prompted to write to the preacher . One of his points , she had felt , might be enlarged further and given a double interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply . But the Reverend Frederic Monod had been impressed by her intelligent grasp of his sermon . His response had been cordial , and a meeting was arrangedon one of her free afternoons . From this first encounter each had found the other a stimulating personality . She found in him a most unusual type of clergyman for France or any other country . Here was a man of fine physical presence with the intelligenceof a scholar and the religious zeal of a prophet . Well born and prosperous , with tolerance for others yet with the highest of personal standards , he was that rare combination  --  a minister of the Gospel and a man of the world . He lived simply but with dignity in a large old house where he received Henriette in his study on more than one occasion . Each day except Saturday and Sunday he opened his doors between four and six o'clock to any who might care to come , and for those hours he gave his whole mind and heart to the religious and personalproblems of his visitors . Henriette told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menage . They talked usually of matters he had mentioned in his sermons , or they discussedthe unrest and discontent among the people of France , the mistakes of the King and his ministers in their policies . Always his comments were wise and worth hearing , and he had a way of drawing her out to express her own views . " Ah , Mademoiselle Deluzy , " he would caution , " you 're much too headlong and idealistic . You must not jump to conclusions so fast , not even if you have read your John Stuart Mill so thoroughlyand though you can quote Miss Barrett 's Cry of thep212Children ' in such perfect English . Of course the world would be better if all the people in it could be well fed and well educated . But remember , there 's no way been found yet to pry holes in men 's brains and pour the learning in . It 's discouraging how many seem to carry a complete immunity to education in their systems . " " ' Mat may be , " she would retort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a chance at it . That 's the only way we can ever tell those who , you say , are immune from those who might learn and benefit . " So they would amicably exchange opinions , sometimes arguingtheir points , sometimes in complete accord until other visitorsarrived or coffee was brought in an old family urn that spoke to Henriette eloquently of her host 's background and financialindependence . Always she left that house refreshed in mind and spirit . She had met his wife only once , and she knew as little of his life and habits as he knew of hers . It was a friendship of the mind that in no way involved the senses , for which , in her inner perplexity and stress , she gave fervent thanks . So tonight , after she had written notes to the Remeys and Madame Le Maire , she also wrote to the Reverend Frederic Monod to wish him well in the coming year . It was a courteous , charming note ; and she felt in a more benevolent mood towards the whole world when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pen slip over the smooth , expensive note paper provided by the chateau . Impulsively she reached for another sheet and addressed the greeting to her grandfather . She could afford to be charitable to the harsh old man . After all , he was her only relative , and she would make the gesture of forgetting past differences . It gave her no small satisfaction to slip a hundred-franc note into the letter . " After all , " she thought , " he can not say that I am ungrateful , no matter what other names he may find for me . " Still she sat at the desk , her eyes fixed on the remaining sheet of note paper . Blank and white it lay under her fingers . There were the pens and ink  --  so near , yet she might not write the onep213letter it would have eased her heart to put on paper . A simple Happy New Year addressed to him and signed with her initials might fall under other eyes that would twist the words to mean something ugly and evil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . All went smoothly and well in those early months of 1846 . The weeks slipped by , serene and uneventful , save for the brief , unpredictableappearances of the Duc . He spent long hours with his mother and also much time supervising work in the park . The building of a luxurious conservatory to replace an old greenhouse had been started , and he was full of elaborate plans for raising rare varieties of plants . " Why must you have all these hothouse flowers , monsieur ? " she asked him once when he was taking her through the halffinishedglass addition , explaining all that would be blooming there by another winter . " Soon there will be snowdrops and primroses in the woods , and then summer will be coming . Of course these artificially raised flowers will be rare and beautiful , but somehow I think we were not meant to upset the course of the seasons . " " But that 's what pleases me , " he told her . " I like to do just that , to feel I have power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One must have something to do . " Though he smiled and shrugged , she felt the boredom behind his words . So she said no more about the greenhouse . It would probably cost , she reflected , more than enough to support the Remeys for a year , and in less than that time he would be tired of it . He left her presently to consult some workmen buildingone of the great brick furnaces . She watched him as he stood there , head and shoulders above them , dwarfing their bodies by the magnificent proportions of his own . His head was turned sideways , and she was struck anew by the beauty of his features . In full face he was a handsome man ; but the indolent fullness of lips and cheeks and the lines about his eyes made him look his forty-one years . But in profile the proud , clear modeling was ac/centuated . He reminded her of some sculptured head un an old coin . " Oh , " she thought , " what a pity he was not born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he 's too rugged for that -- -but in the north somewhere . Yes , he 's like the figurehead of some old Viking ship . He belongs to a time when it was enough for a man to be strong and beautiful . Now that 's less valued than the cunning of a man 's mind to outwit the schemes of other minds . " She had never been deceived that the Due 's mind was remarkablein any way . His gifts lay not in that direction , but in his body 's vigor . He had been endowed above others with vitality and good looks . And all this was going to waste before her eyes . There was no outlet for this power that possessed him , and some day it would break loose with the very weight of its unused force , and his own strength would be his undoing . She felt this instinctively , as she waited in the half-completed conservatory . It seemed to her only another symbol of the futile extravagance by which he tried to appease his own unrest . Why must she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping by them both with every breath they drew , and he played with piles of brick as he must have played with blocks long ago on a nursery floor . There must be something she could do , somethingshe could say . But what ? She belonged to a world where people made their own way , living precariously by their wits or the work of their hands . That was not his world . He could never understand what she meant when she talked of such things . He had not been born to understand ; and , in a way , that was what she loved in him . " Come ! " He was beside her again . " You must see where I mean to put up the new pavilion by the lily pond next summer . " " Ah , but , monsieur , " she began . Then she broke off before she had started to protest . She could not say simply to him : " Monsieur , a pavilion by the lily pond is not going to make you happy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single grain . Face your misery , and findp215some means to overcome it . Work at something till you ache and the sweat runs into your eyes . Make haste before it 's too late and this unused power strikes back at you . " " No , I 've been away from the schoolroom too long , " she said aloud . " I must go now ; besides , I 'm cold standing here in this February wind . " " You do n't look cold , Mademoiselle Deluzy , " he persisted , his eyes disarming her by their scrutiny . " Your lips are n't blue , and your cheeks are positively rosy . " But she did not give in . " I tell you I 'm cold , " she repeated stubbornly . She hurried back to the chateau with that queer mixture of glowing inner warmth and conflict of emotions which was more and more the aftermath of her meetings with him . Only now she no longer asked : " Where will it all end ? " She acknowledged that she was caught fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the beginning she had believed she could keep free of its threads . Later she had tried to break away . But now she had given up both these courses . She had no wish to escape . In mid-February the older girls returned to Paris , and she had good reports of their progress in studies from Albert Rcmey and of their social doings from Louise , who wrote of theaters and opera and numerous outings with her mother and her Sebastiani cousins . Henriette had more time than she knew how to use , with Berthe and Raynald her only charges . She busied herself with her painting ; spent much time reading aloud to the old I ) uchesse ; she read volume after volume to herself in the long evenings ; and wrote letters to her scattered friends . Many of those she wrote that winter went to Isabella in Turin and to her other ex-pupil in England , Nina Hislop , who had also been married . These two young women , who differed so greatly in temperament and upbringing , both turned to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their households were hardly as absorbing to her as to the writers of these lengthy and naive letters . She often smiled overp216their characteristic outpourings : the English girl 's , so shy and conventional , so true to the pattern of domesticity being set by the young Queen ; Isabella 's less restrained and far more lively descriptions of social activity and domestic bliss . But both were happy ; their physical contentment and the secret intoxication of being wives and heads of prosperous households pervaded every letter and seemed almost to leap out between the neatly penned words . " Dearest Mademoiselle , " one posted from Sussex might begin , " your felicitations upon the happy event to which we look forward in midsummer filled me with joy . I pray that I may be equal to the responsibilities in store for me , though I must confessthat often I feel very young and not in the least like one so soon to become a mother . But my dear husband is very devoted and considerate of me at this time . He quite spoils me with surprisesfrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might show you his latest one  --  a rosewood drawing-room set , done in crimsondamask . How strange to think that not so long ago I was still a timid schoolgirl , and you were correcting my French exercises . . . " Or it might be : " Chere Mademoiselle : Your letter was most dear to me . I was homesick at sight of your writing on the familiarchateau paper , but only for a moment , for though I think often of the old schoolroom I would not wish to return to it . The days fly , and each so full of things to see and do , and my dear husband lavishes every attention he can think of upon me . We dine out often and entertain frequently ourselves now that we are settled in our own villa which I can scarcely wait to have you see . And I am so happy , chere Mademoiselle . It seems impossible that I could ever have entertained those doubts and fears about which you once tried to reassure me ... " She was proud of these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , when the letters came , brimming over with happy confidence , she could not repress a pang . These girls were married women now  --  secure and beloved and already meetingp217experiences she had never known , that perhaps she would never know . Each would fulfill the destiny that Nature had intended . Soon one would be a mother , and before long the other would be writing as rapturous an announcement . And here she sat , still a spinster and a governess . A dozen such years lay behind her , and no doubt a dozen more lay ahead . In a few months she would be thirty-four years old . She flattered herself that she appeared considerablyyounger than her age . Still one could not overlook facts . She had not had the means or the opportunity to marry well . She had only had her youth to offer for a dowry . And now she no longer had that . It had been spent , without stint , on the youth of girls like Nina and Isabella . She did not begrudge it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters . There was never the faintest hint of bitterness in her answers because she loved youth for itself . She had always given herself to it  --  first from necessity and then because it had become a habit . It was natural for her to reach out to others . She gave freely all that she had to offer , and by the same token she drew from others and was nourished even by experiences she might not share . Like a tree set in meager soil , she drove her roots in every direction , seeking the elements her spirit craved . The talked-of visit to Isabella in Turin came about , however , far sooner than she had expected.  |p218IT  WAS EARLY SUMMER , and the Duc and Duchesse de Praslin hadtaken a villa by the sea for the month of June . Dr. Simon had recommended a watering place for Madame 's health after the winter in Paris ; and since she had not felt equal to the long journeyto Corsica , Dieppe had been chosen . Henriette and the two younger children had joined the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reunion had been a happy one . The weather was fine , with sunlight glittering on each wave that broke in rhythmicwhiteness on the beach below their windows . At first the Duchesse was almost cordial in her meeting with Henriette , though she still refused to eat at the same table with her . This had been the first cause of trouble . The villa was far from large , and serving two separate sets of meals simultaneously could not be managed as easily as in Paris or at the chateau . The Duc had made the mistake of trying to argue with her , and of pointing out her unreasonableness in such petty matters . At last , when he refused to humor her and even went so far as to take all his meals with the children and Henriette , the old grievancesand outbursts began . Through the flimsy walls that separated the young people 's apartment from those of their parents Henriette heard the familiar reverberations of that heavy , accusingvoice directed not so much against the Duc as against herself . No matter what actually happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would somehow end by her being to blame . Though she had long ago learned immunity to similar tirades , she could not entirely close her eyes and ears . Once she even begged the Duc to make some sort of compromise . " Please , monsieur , " she had pleaded , " let me eat alone if that will help the situation . Quarters here are small , and we must make adjustments . "  | " The Duchesse refuses to make any , and I see no reason why the whole household should be upset to satisfy this whim of hers . " " Then , monsieur , I beg you to dine with her . I hesitate to interfere in such personal matters ; still , if you could humor her these few weeks for the children 's sakes , it would be easier for us all . " But he shook his head , and the old obdurate expression settled about his lips . He shrugged expressively . " If it 's not this , it will be something else , " he insisted . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between them . The strain , she guessed , was far greater than before the old Marechal had given his ultimatum months ago . The very fact that the Duchesse had her husband 's company in public , that to the eyes of the world they were reunited , only made his indifference to her in private more unbearable . And she would never let go for an instant , though what she clung to so doggedly must be more merciless in its power to hurt than nettles stinging bare flesh . " Poor fool , " Henriette thought often during those difficult days by the sea , " she 's only goading him and herself to desperation . How can she and her father be so blind as to believe that their money can win back his affections ? Why ca n't they see that it only makes him more bitter because it mocks his manhood . Ciel , I wish this month at Dieppe were safely over . " Outwardly she took no notice of black moods and rebuffs . But under her apparent serenity she writhed at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infecting the entire householdwith her own misery . The children felt the tension and reacted according to their dispositions . In a week the long anticipatedholiday had taken on the confused unreality of a nightmare . " Sometimes , " Henriette thought , " the weak learn kindness in self-defense ; but it 's not so with this woman . She must torture others with her own misfortune . It 's terrible when the weak are also cruel for then we are defenseless against them . "  |p220It  was a combination that shocked her . It was as if , when these two elements joined forces , they produced an almost inhuman quality from which she reacted violently . There were times when site had all she could do to keep silence as one or another of their little group suffered . At other times she turned chill with her own contempt for such exhibitions of petulance and uncontrolled temper . The only excuse for them , she told herself , must be temporarymadness , and there were occasions when Henriette actuallydoubted the Duchesse 's sanity . At such times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maneuvered to keep them away from the villa as much as possible . Louise and the three middle sisters had acquired considerableskill at avoiding their mother 's demands . So the two younger ones were most often pounced upon . Almost invariably disaster followed . Berthe was not easily hurt . She had a thick skin and seldom let others prick below the surface . But this shell of indifference which protected her had a particularly irritating effect upon the Duchesse . Raynald , on the other hand , took his mother 's moods and reproaches to heart . Although he had becomesturdier physically , he could still be nervously upset by any emotional strain , and his mother 's shifting moods reacted upon his whole system . Particularly he resented any slights , real or imagined , to his beloved Mademoiselle Deluzy . He would fly like a furious small dog to her defense , and this the Duchesse naturally took as a deliberate campaign on Henriette 's part to turn her youngest child against her . That fortnight in Dieppe grew daily more unendurable . Betweenher efforts to appease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unwelcome affection , Henriette 's usually steady nerves felt frayed ; and her patience had never been more tried . She had few chances to talk with the Duc , for she was more than ever certain that the servants had been ordered to watch them both . Several of the old ones had left the Praslin service , and the newcomers were all on the best of terms with Madame Leclerc ; so Henriette knew they would be only toop221eager to bear tales to her discredit . She went her way with care and a stubborn determination to put through the stay without disaster . For disaster was in the air . She could read the warning signals altogether too well by now , yet she was unprepared for the storm when it finally broke upon them . It had been a glorious , bright blue day , and she had spent most of it on the sand with Berthe and Raynald while the older girls went on some expedition with their father . The water had been warm , and the two children had splashed and bathed delightedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striped umbrella beside their bathing machine . They had started back by midafternoon , walking along the promenade where the small shops faced the ocean . Their progress was slow because of numerousshells and starfish which Raynald insisted upon bringing from the beach . When they were not pausing to retrieve these treasures from underfoot , Berthe would be held by some particularlyenticing window display . Halfway to the villa , they met the Duc and the others , and that meant purchases of toys and sweetmeats . They reached home at last full of chatter and in gay spirits after the hours of salt air and sun . The villa seemed deserted , and the drawing-room beckoned cool and pleasant in its soft gray and rose with the glass doors open to the terrace and the blue water beyond . They all drifted in , and presently one of the girls went to a square piano and began trying the keys . " Oh , here 's some music , " Louise exclaimed , looking up from a cabinet she had been investigating . Evidently the former tenants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces were all gay and popular , with waltzes and polkas predominating . Polkas had been the rage for the past two seasons , and the girls needed no urging to dance . The drawing-room furniture rocked to the lively tunes and the quick steps of Marie , Celeste , Amelie , and Berthe while Louise 's fingers sped over the black and ivory keys . Henriette leaned against the sofa cushions and gave herself up to the infectiousness of dance music and the spontaneity of the girls ' delighted re/spouse to it . Their young , slim bodies in full ruffled sl , : irts noeed with such lightness and spirit . Their cheeks grew flushed , their eyes were starry , and their curls kept time with the quick steps . Up and down the room they went , weaving in and out of furniture , now dancing into patches of brightness by the open doors , now moving into dimmer corners . With the sea so blue and the music so gay and the young limbs so slim and sure , Henriette felt entranced . The headache she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her miraculously . She felt light-hearted and festive , as if the polka had taken possession of her , too , though only her toes hidden under her wide skirts gave her away by discreet tapping . She looked across at the Duc , who stood by the terrace doors . He was watching his daughters with intent appreciation ; and his look disarmed her as it always did when she caught him unawares , studying his children . All that was simple and genuine and kind in the man was uppermost then . She stared at him fascinated , while the artist in her tried to fix that image clearly in her mind . She wished that she had the power to paint him as she saw him in that moment of affectionate relaxation . He looked over in her direction and smiled as their eyes met . " Mademoiselle , " Louise pleaded , " could n't you play one polka for us ? I have n't had a chance to leave the piano . Please do . " Henriette obligingly took her place , and presently she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room as her partner . She had never seen the Duc in this role before , though she had always known that he must be a superb dancer . As she saw him begin the lively steps with that easy , effortless grace , she enviedLouise , and for the next few minutes she scarcely lifted her eyes from the sheets of music before her . Then , growing more familiar with the notes , she allowed herself to look up and catch glimpses of the reflected scene in a long mirror that faced the piano. - It was in one of these glimpses that she became obsessed by a peculiar sensation  --  not of arrested motion in space , but rather asp223if all motion were gathered in that room , embodied in the whirlingdancers and her own speeding fingers . She bent to the keys in sudden frenzy . She was possessed with the idea of keeping alive this gayety , this lovely rhythm which would die when she stopped playing as surely as it had been born when the music began . In her ten fingers lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not end , this must not be over . Quick feet , stepping so surely . and freely in unison ; warm swaying bodies and glowing cheeks  --  it was as if she saw them all cold and still forever . But the revelation only spurred her on . She played faster and more furiously , gaining what rest she could on some longer note as it flew past her like the flight of a bird seen from a train window . And always , under the music her hands made , a warning beat in her ears , faint and fine as the imprisoned whisper of sea in a shell : " Some day you will remember all this ; some day when time has caught up with these swift feet and all of you in this room are scattered to the four winds . " Over and over she played the tune , her own tireless energy willingthe dancers to go on without pause . It was only when a suddenshadow darkened the mirror and Raynald plucked anxiously at her arm , that her hands fell limply into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she turned and saw the Duchcssc standing alone in the doorway . For a moment no one moved , the dancers stood still where they had left off . Then she saw the heavy figure bear down upon them , trailing yards of violet silk as she came . " So , Theo , " the tense throaty voice was beginning , " so I find you at last after hours of waiting ! What excuse have you to give me this time ? " " Excuse ? " he announced with determined casualness , keeping his arm about Louise . " Why , Fanny , surely I need no excuse to be here at home , dancing with my own daughters ? " Before she spoke again the Duchesse 's glance swept the room and rested suspiciously upon Henriette , who still sat before the mute piano . " You need not try to mend matters by making light of them . "  |p224The  dark eyes flashed , and Henriette caught the peculiar reddishluster that she had come to dread in them . It was like an ominous light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'hc girls shifted uneasily and drew together ; Raynald pressed closer . " Is n't it enough for you to humiliate me at home , without doing it publicly as well ? Do you think I enjoyed being made a fool of before them all at the Villa Quelques Fleurs ? " " At the Villa Quelques Fleurs ? What are you talking about , Fanny ? " " Where we were invited this afternoon by Signor and Signora Mantino , and where I 've been waiting for you to join me for the last hour and a half . Do you think I enjoyed their questions about your absence and the sly looks they exchanged when I had to leave alone ? And all the time I made excuses that no one believed , you were here , enjoying yourself  --  without a thought of me except to laugh and say : While the cat 's away , the mice will play . ' Oh , I know what goes on behind my back ! " " Please , Fanny , be still for a moment . " He dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I knew nothing about this invitation , this appointment that I failed to keep . " " And you care nothing , that 's plain . But if you 'd taken the trouble to read what I wrote you this morning you 'd have known . I left it myself at your door since I 'm not permitted to speak to you any longer except when you feel in the mood to grant me a few minutes of your time . " He must have left the Duchesse 's letter unread . Henriette guessed that from the way he reddened at mention of it . But he managed to keep his voice cool and deliberate . " I 'm sorry if I caused you inconvenience , " he explained . " But I left my room early to take the older girls on a little outing . We 've only just returned , and I dare say the letter is lying now unopened on my secretary . " " And I dare say there are many others unopened there and inp225your waste basket ; or perhaps you and Mademoiselle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys keeping my letters for curlpapers . It 's the sort of irony that would please her . " Henriette did not hear his response . The Duchesse 's attack had been so unexpected that composure left her . The drawing room and the figures in it turned hazy before her eyes . She felt a dull pounding in her ears , but whether it came from the surf on the beach below the terrace or from the blood that mounted in a hot wave to her neck and cheeks and forehead she could never tell . She wanted to rise and lead the children from that room . The Duchesse seemed to fill it with her own distorted imagination . But Henriette could not move . She had no power to make herself leave the piano . The little black notes of music moved fantastically before her eyes , and she could scarcely focus her attention on the flow of words that came across the room . She knew that they concerned her . Out of the vehement torrent of this other woman 's rage she caught her own name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , Theo , no ! You ca n't stop me . I 've kept silence too long . Let the children know how you torture their mother ; how you and this woman have turned them against me . Some day they 'll understand , when their own hearts are breaking from neglect and cruelty ; only then it will be too late  --  " " Fanny , in God 's name , I beg you  --  " " You may well call on Him , for He knows my sorrows and my tears and my prayers . Yes , God knows what I 've suffered ever since you brought Mademoiselle Deluzy here . As if I had n't been shamed enough before she came . And now I 'm ridiculed or pitied wherever I go . I see it in people 's eyes whether they humiliate me by words or not . And she sits at the head of my table while I eat alone like an outcast in my own house . You and my children hang on her every word . It 's Mademoiselle this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the serpent in the Gardenof Eden ! "  |p226Her  voice broke , and a second of horrified silence followed beforeRaynald lifted up his head and answered with a shrillness that brought I lenriette back to her senses . " No , " the little boy cried , and she felt his whole frame tremblingbeside her . " No , Mademoiselle is n't a serpent . She 's good and kind , and I love her . I love her , and I hate you ! " " Hush ! " Henriette laid her hand to his lips and tried to quiet the wild sobs that overtook him . " Be quiet , Raynald . Please , cheri , please . " " But  --  but she called you wicked names . Sh-she has no right  --  " " There , you see , even Raynald , my baby , takes her part . She 's bewitched you all , and I might as well be dead and out of your way forever . " " Fanny , please , you must listen to reason . " The Duc laid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to excite her . Her resentment had been gathering for days , and now nothing could stop the savage force of it , not even her children drawing away from her in a frightened , wide-eyed group . He kept his hand on her arm . Henriette guessed the intensity of his feeling from the way his fingers sank into the plumpness under the violet silk . What a grip he had ! His strength must be phenomenal when he was roused . Such a change had come over his face that she recoiled before the transformation . Only a few minutes ago he had been a different humanbeing . Now all that was amiable and pleasant and kind had given way to hardness and cruelty and a positive hatred . The features themselves actually seemed to have altered before her eyes ; to have assumed the crude exaggeration of a painted mask . " Mon Die , , , " she thought , " if she should try him beyond the limits of his endurance ! I must do something . I must n't sit here and let this go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice now heavy and accusing , now rising with uncontrolled shrillness . Henriette no longer heard the words she was saying . With an effort shep227forced herself to rise from the piano bench . Keeping firm hold of Raynald 's hand , she moved forward . " Madame , monsieur . " The clear firm tones of her voice silenced the Duchesse 's hysterical outpouring for a moment . She regarded Henriette out of eyes that had the glassy stare of a half-crazed animal . " With your permission I will take the children to their rooms . Raynald shrank against her , his face hidden . The five girls pressed closer . Their stiff full skirts made a faint rustling in the sudden quiet . " You need n't trouble , mademoiselle . " The Duchesse 's voice fell like a whiplash upon them all . " Do n't think of inconveniencing yourself on my account ! No , go back to the piano . Go on with your music . Dance , all of you . Do n't give your mother a thought . Let me go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off before he could restrain her , and made for the terrace . They saw her disappear down the steps that led to the sea . So abrupt had been her bolt from the room that for a full moment not one of them uttered a sound or moved . Yet they had all caught the desperate note in her voice . There was not a doubt what she meant to do . " Papa ! Papa ! " Louise found her voice first . " Do n't let her ! " She would have followed her father as he started through the long doors , but he pushed her away . Then he ran hatless towards the water . Mechanically Henriette heard herself quieting the sobbing Raynaldand reassuring the sisters . But all the time she helped them , put away the scattered sheets of music and set the disordered room to rights her ears were strained for any unnatural sounds from the beach or promenade . Any moment she expected to hear warning shouts from below ; and as time passed she waited for the tread of men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dripping violet silk between them . But half an hour passed , and the house remained quiet ; the waves twinkled blue in the sun and broke in steady rhythm on the hard-packed sand.  |p228The  tears dried on the children 's faces though they still appeared strained and furtive and they spoke in scared whispers . Raynald clung to her as had been his habit years before . He gulped forlornlyand could hardly be persuaded to spread his sea treasures to dry in a tray on the window sill . It was another half-hour before the sound of steps and voices from the next apartment told her that tragedy had been averted . With relief she recognized Madame 's voice speaking to her maid . She did not see the Duc again till they gathered for early dinner . He reappeared just as the soup was being served , immaculatelydressed for the evening . Only a faint tension about his eyes and at the corners of his mouth gave any hint of his recent experience . That was plain from his manner and the brief , curt assuranceto his daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not wish to discuss what had taken place in the drawingroom . To a timid question from Louise he replied guardedly that Mamma had been badly affected by driving in the strong sunshine . She had taken something to quiet her nerves before retiring . But the strain of the afternoon had been too great for Raynald . Halfway through the meal , he grew pale , slipped from his chair , and left the table with a hurried excuse . Following him to his room Henriette found the boy struggling against an attack of nausea . She made him as comfortable as possible and sat by his bed till he fell asleep at last , exhausted , and she could return to the others . The Duc was playing chess with Celeste , but he called Louise to take his place . Henriette found herself following him to a balconywhich opened from the room . It did not adjoin the next apartment , so they were sure of privacy there . " Monsieur , " she spoke to him through the darkness , " I must know if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " he said . " Not this time , though I thought it was the end . Perhaps it might have been better so  --  God forgive me for what I say . "  | " Tell me what happened ? What did she try to do ? You were gone so long I almost went mad listening . " " There was no sign of her on the beach . I ran along it , as close to the water 's edge as I could get . People pointed to me . They must have thought I 'd lost my mind . Then I decided she must have made for the amusement pier  --  perhaps she 'd even plunged from it already . I kept looking everywhere for that violet dress and I was afraid to ask people if they 'd seen her . But as I started back along the Promenade , in one of those little shops , I caught sight of her . There she was , bending over a tray full of knickknacks , talking to the shopkeeper and picking out what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How did she seem then ? " " Calmer than I am now . I stood beside her while she made the purchases . Then I called a carriage and made her get in . We drove back , and I left her at the door of her own room . " " Did she have anything more to say ? " " Nothing much . It was exactly as if that scene you witnessed had never been . I was too unnerved myself to bring it up . My one idea was to see her safely indoors . " " What do you make of it , monsieur ? " " I do n't know what to make of it except that we must n't run the risk of another . She 's never given way like this before the children . They are not to be subjected to it again . " " They 've heard enough today , monsieur . Whether they know what she meant or why she turned on me , they guessed she meant to kill herself . They realize that she hates me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I to do ? I ca n't stay on here , that 's plain . " " You will take Louise and the two youngest and go to Turin at once . There 's a train you can catch to Paris tomorrow noon . Isabella has been begging for a visit , and the change will do Raynaldgood . Yes , that 's the best plan . " He was so close to her there in the darkness on the narrow iron balcony that she could hear him draw a deep breath of relief at the decision he had made . Even without seeing him she wasp230acutely aware of his bewilderment and confusion , of his need of her . They whispered together like two frightened children who had just escaped from danger , but who clung to one another becausethey knew that even greater danger might be lying just ahead . " And after Turin  --  what then ? " She wanted so much to take his hand that she had to keep both her own pressed to the cold iron railing at her back . " God knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes . Act as if this had never been . Put the children off if they questionyou , and in a fortnight she 'll no doubt be urging your return . " " But I must think of myself , monsieur . You heard her this afternoon . She  --  she was n't quite human . That 's what terrifies me . I think she 's deranged , particularly so where I am concerned . You know I 've tried to go before , and now  --  " He reached out and laid his hand on her shoulder . The pressure of his strong fingers came hotly through the thin material of her dress . " And now you will go in and pack your things and get a long night 's rest . The train leaves at noon tomorrow precisely . " " But it 's no use to bury one 's head in the sand like a silly ostrichwhen facts must be faced . " " I shall see you to the train . Arrangements will be made for you to spend the night in Paris at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please listen to me , monsieur . I 've only brought you trouble , though I 've tried to do my best for you , for the children . " " And I 'd consider it a great favor , Mademoiselle Deluzy , if you would see that Berthe and Louise write their mother from Turin . Perhaps you also would write her a letter with your own impression of Isabella . Such a letter would please the Duchesse , but of course I shall leave that to you . You have excellent judgment in all things  --  "  | " In all but one , monsieur "  --  she moved away from him towards the room where the girls clustered together in the lamplight  --  " orI should never let you persuade me against my better judgment  --  " " Then you 'll do what I ask ? Good ! I 'll order the carriage for eleven tomorrow . " She wavered there on the doorsill , then impulsively turned back to him and the darkness . She felt the warm strength of his great frame behind her , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ask too much . " She drew away resolutely . " Do I have to tell you that what happened this afternoon is sure to happen again ? " " There 's nothing you could tell me that I do not know already . But if I should tell you what my days and nights have become you 'd understand what it means to have you here in my household . One snatches a moment now and then to forget . To be happy  --  that 's why I 'm asking this of you , for the children , most of all for myself . " " Monsieur "  --  she dared not let him guess how the urgency of his appeal affected her  --  " I 'd help you if I could , but there 's little enough I can do . I 've only brought discord and scandal to your household , at least to the eyes of the world . " " Who cares for the world ? I did n't suppose , Mademoiselle Deluzy , that with your courage , your independence , you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Perhaps I 've been too independent because my own consciencewas clear . But I 'm beginning to realize that when we break through the shell of convention we can never crawl back into it again . That protection is gone . I 've gained many things by staying here with your children , monsieur , but I 've lost much also . " " And you 'd do it again because you 're brave and generous , would n't you ? "  |p232She  was moved by the simple directness of his question . His almost childish trust in her devotion and integrity were more eloquent than any other appeal he might have made . " I will go to Turin tomorrow , " she told him at last . Bending over her boxes and portmanteau later that evening , she asked herself again and again why she had not held out against him . Where was her spirit that she had not written the Duchesse a letter of resignation before she put out her lamp for the night ? What had become of her pride ? At what moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let that precious commodityslip out of her keeping ?  |p233THE  REUNION WITH ISABELLA was so delightful that they lingeredin Turin for the rest of the summer . After those days in Dieppe this carefree interlude in new surroundings reacted upon the young people like wine . It was like old times , they all agreed , to be together again . Isabella 's young husband made a most agreeable host , and when it became necessary for him to go to Sardinia on business , he was grateful to leave his wife in such congenial company . She and Louise were inseparable . When the older sisters had plans of their own Henriette took Berthe and Raynald on long drives and excursions . She found distraction in this . It eased her of problems she could never quite shake from her mind . So they visited the Cathedral , the palaces , and explored the outlying regionsfor relics of early Roman civilization . " See , " she would point out , " this is part of the old wall . The Romans built it before Christ was born , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1846 . It 's strange to think that what men 's hands built a thousand years ago can still endure . " In making the past vivid to the children she was often able to forget the present , more particularly the future . But there were other times when she would grow absent-minded in the middle of something she was saying till Berthe or Raynald prompted her politely . This happened once as they were examining some stonework in a chapel . " Ugh ! " Berthe had pointed to a design of leaves and crude but unmistakably carved mice . " Why do they have such horrid things as mice in a church ? " The priest who was showing them about had smiled indulgently . " It 's part of an ancient legend from the East , " he explained.  | " No one knows how old it is or how it found its way into a Christian church . But the story concerns a traveler lost in a far country , who is perishing from thirst . At last he sees a plant growing above a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cup filled with delicious nectar . The traveler manages by clinging to the stalk to reach the cup , but just as he prepares to quench his thirst he sees below him two mice , one white and one black , nibbling the stem which is his only support . Slowly they are eating it , fiber by fiber . When they meet , the traveler knows that he will be swept away to destruction , but still he puts his lips to the flower 's cup and drinks . " " And what then , mon Pere ? " Raynald 's eyes were wide and dark . " Well , my son , there 's no more to the story . We call it an allegory , and I can only explain it to you in symbols . That traveler stands for all men who have ever lived on earth . The mice are day and night  --  one white , one black ; and they slowly nibble time away from under us . Yet , even in the face of certain death , men still reach for the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The children were not impressed . Already they had found some new distraction . But Henriette lingered by the primitive piece of stonecutting , and when they left she thanked the priest for his trouble and dropped more coins than usual in the alms box . She could not put the legend out of her mind . It seemed to have survived the ages solely for her . " Yes , " she told herself . " I know that leaf above the precipice . I know because I 'm clinging to it now , and the mice are eating my days and nights away . But how many of us , I wonder , cling to leaves that hold no nectar ? " She no longer twisted and turned possibilities this way and that . She went from one day to the next , and the old dread lifted like a fog bank from her immediate horizon . She would go back to Paris with an open mind and decide then upon the wisest course . She would talk to Frederic Monod , tell him some/thing of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better time to seek another position if need be . Here in Turin the problems of the Praslin household no longer closed in about her . She did not feel completely surrounded by domestic intrigue and conflicting emotions from which she could never escape . Almost she convinced herself that everything might come out right in the end if she could be patient enough . This hope was encouraged in late August by the arrival of a letter from Melun , addressed to Henrietta in the Duchesse 's own hand . It was in reply to a rather guarded and perfunctory report she had sent the Duchesse about her daughters . Praslin , August 25 , 1846I will not delay a moment further , my dear Mademoiselle , in thanking you for your kind letter which gave me great pleasure . You apologized for its length , but far from finding it tedious , I could have wished it to have been twice as long . It was brought me with Berthe 's from the village post office this evening . Truly I can not deny that it was time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart had been much disturbed by the long silence . But all 's well that ends well . You can guess how overjoyed I am at all you tell me of Isabella and her happiness . But I am rather surprised that you should find her so unchanged by the new life and experiences . Her letters to me show a great difference , so much more painstaking and expansive . I am indeed counting on your kindness in continuing to send me information about my absent ones . My little girls here are constantlyat my side . On fine days we spend hours in the Park , and often we gather and read aloud from the works of Moliere . There has been an epidemic of fever in the neighborhood , so we live completelyisolated ; but , far from being prisoners , my dear daughters and I are enjoying our solitude . I was glad to hear that both Louise and Berthe speak of me often with Isabella , even though you may only have mentioned this to please me . But in any case the words brought happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this poor letter , written from the full/ness of my ! wall . ( ) nee more I thank you a thousand times for your note ; and I beg you to write me further details , as I could never hear enough of them . FANNY SEBASTIANI PRASLIN . This letter Henriette read and reread , trying to fathom the mood and meaning behind its unusual affability . What could she do but take it in the spirit of good will in which it had evidentlybeen written ? She knew the Duchesse was not clever or subtle enough by nature to assume a role she did not feel . Whateverher faults , she was at least sincere and simple to the point of primitiveness . Henriette could only hope that the outburst at Dieppe had cleared the air . Perhaps it took violent measures to purge so violent a nature of accumulated grievances . If she regrettedher behavior and wished to be reconciled , Henriette would certainly meet her halfway ; and if the unfortunate attack had passed from her mind completely , then at least their next meeting would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the extraordinary letter away in her writing case , was all she could make of it for the present . Looking back to those last months of 1846 and the early winter of 1847 , she was always at a loss to explain why they should have been so harmonious and uneventful . She returned , refreshed and girded for battle , only to find peace and reconciliation both at Melun and later on in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore . The scene at Dieppe and the other stormy sessions she had had with the Duchesse began to take on the unreality of bad dreams . A sort of tacit understanding , a mutual truce , seemed to have been established between them . They were not trustful of each other , but now they could meet without sparks flying . Even the servants , though they continued to range their loyalty on the side of their mistress , were less hostile to the governess . Henriette asked no more than that she should be left to her duties without interference , and the Duc on his part seemed thankful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take his meals with the children and Henriette , but a slight compromise in this matter appeared to have eased the situation . The old Marechal had taken up residence in his quarters , and the Duchesse took her meals with him . Each day one of the four older girls joined them at dejeuner or dinner . Furthermore the Duchesse 's health had improved sufficiently for her to attend more theaters and concerts than usual ; and Henriette , to her great surprise , was often included in the party . In these invitationsshe suspected the hand of the Marechal , who doubtless felt it would be advisable for the governess to be seen in public with his daughter . Henriette did her best not to abuse the privilege . It was strange to find herself in favor again . Often it was difficult to adjust herself to this new state of affairs after the long estrangement . She tried to put suspicion from her , though she still unconsciously braced herself for slights before they came her way . " Take heed of a wind that comes in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that constantly recurred to her that winter . Just before Christmas , Louise 's betrothal was announced , and the household united in celebration . She was to marry a man somewhat her senior , and the marriage would not take place for another year . Between this and holiday festivities it was New Year 's again before Henriette realized that another year had gone . Albert Remey came daily to the Rue du Faubourg-SaintHonoreto continue his teaching . Henriette took comfort in this and in her visits to these old friends . She went to see Madame Le Maire , too , though her free afternoons were rare . The ReverendFrederic Monod , she heard preach occasionally , but the chance to talk with him as she had planned did not materialize . Either there were other visitors to his study , or time was pressing ; so she postponed asking his advice . Sometimes she discussed her difficulties with Albert and Marie , but their own ideally happy marriage and their complete loyalty to her made it impossible for their judgment to be altogether unbiased . In their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differ/ence in religion must be to blame for the Duchesse 's prejudices . Like Henriette , they belonged to the Protestant faith , and like herself , they knew that this could present serious difficulties . Albert had forfeited several teaching appointments because of his religious beliefs and , as he frequently pointed out , it was only the Duc de Praslin 's tolerance in such matters that had given them their present opportunities . Madame Le Maire , however , gave her opinion gratis and frequently . " The sooner you get clear of these Praslins , the better , " the old woman insisted . " That 's no household for a girl like you to be in . " " But I 'm not exactly a girl any more . " " Well , you 're far more dangerous than if you were one . Remember you 're just enough younger than his wife and older than his daughters to attract a man like the Duc . And you can be altogether too attractive when you care to be . " " Oh , come now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm warning you , as I did before you ever took up your duties there ; before your name got into print . " " Oh , so you read the scandal sheets , Madame Le Maire ! " " Certainly . I read what all Paris reads , and I can make as much of it as the next one . Apparently you ca n't , or you 'd have sense enough not to sail so near to the wind . " " I 'm not afraid of this wind you speak of . " Madame 's croakingsonly made Henriette feel more confident in her own ability . " I 'm used to steering through rough waters and narrow courses , and I like managing my own boat . " " That 's all very well , but wait till your boat capsizes , as it 's bound to some day . Then you 'll be glad enough to come back to the Rue du Harlay . " Henriette always shrugged and changed the subject at this point . No use arguing with one who always expected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what harsh blows life could have dealt this obstinate old woman to make her so skeptical.  |p239She  hoped , if she herself lived to be as old , she would not fall into the same mold of bitterness . Still , in her heart , she knew that Madame 's cold eyes were more shrewd than either Albert 's or Marie 's ; that she was as wise in her untutored way as the Reverend Frederic Monod . The weeks slipped by . Spring blew into Paris once more with its aromatic invitation to the country . But the Praslin family did not accept as usual , for the Duc was to take his place in the House of Peers in April . All that winter he had been much absorbed in matters of politics and had spent more time than formerlyat the palace . He had always been a favorite with the King who , feeling the growing dissatisfaction in the country , leaned more heavily for support on the younger peers . Henriette felt relieved at this new interest in affairs outside his personal life , even though she disapproved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded now in his remarks to her upon affairs in the country , and she on her part was careful not to expressher own opinions so freely . He spent less time in the schoolroomof late , and it seemed to her that he deliberately avoided opportunities that would throw them together . She missed the stimulation of their earlier and more frequent meetings , but she knew it was better for all concerned that they should meet less often . Yet always she felt the crosscurrents of restlessness and dissatisfaction in him . She knew he craved her approval and reassurancewhether he asked them of her or not . One particular day she was always to remember out of that spring because he shared it with her ; because some fortunate wind of chance seemed to have given it to them without plan or forethought . She had promised to drive to Versailles with Berthe and Raynald on the first fine Saturday in April ; and when the morning came and they were being stowed into the carriage , the Duc had unexpectedly appeared to join the expedition . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they left the city behind . After they reached Versailles the four went on foot in search of a place to eat lunch in the open . The palace itself didp240not appeal to Berthe and Raynald . The fountains were not playingthat day , and the children 's hearts were set elsewhere . They wanted to find the remains of Marie Antoinette 's hameau with its thatched cottages and barns and dovecots in half-ruin . They must explore the mysterious rock grotto , once dedicated to the god of love , and they must eat their luncheon by the fish pond and the little stream that had been brought there for a Queen 's pleasure , and that still gurgled among artificially piled rocks that were green now with more than half a century of moss . " Here , here it is ! " the two children called as they came on the pathetically romantic little group of buildings . " Look , Papa , that must have been the mill over there . Mademoiselle , see how the brook tumbles over the little waterfall ! " Their delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not help thinking that Marie Antoinette herself would have been pleased by this tribute paid so many years afterward to her favorite toy . The three left her with the lunch basket while they explored the little stream and hunted for the hidden Grotto of Love . She spread a carriage rug on the steps of a tiny peasant cottage and , seating herself upon it , let the melancholycharm of the place work its will . How still it was , and yet alive with the pulses of spring ! The air came fresh and redolent with earthy dampness . The warm noon sun touched her with the same magnetic rays that summonedgreen grass blades from brown loam ; that urged buds to uncurl on bare branches . Nothing disturbed the peace of that small clearing . Not even a caretaker passed on his rounds . Henrietterelaxed against the moldering wall , noticing as she did so faint remnants of the paint that had been cunningly laid on to give the impression of worn bricks and plaster chipped away . It struck her as ironical that this subterfuge should remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builder to simulate age . It made her think of some child who draws lines on a smooth brow , believing that wrinkles will not leave their marks there soon enough . And yet she could understand how one might believe that noth/ing could ever shatter the peace and sunny quiet of this place . She felt glad the mob had not wrecked it in their madness all those years ago . It seemed , in those few moments , almost like a personalrefuge for her and for the birds , nesting and flying all about . She reached into the basket for a bit of bread and watched them find it , even as some remote feathered ancestors might have eaten cake crumbs from a Queen 's table . Later , over their luncheon , the four talked of that unfortunate Queen . She seemed curiously real to them all that day , almost as if she were their absent hostess . " It must have been fun to fish in the pond , " Raynald observed . " I wish I had a line now to try . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Berthe added . " I believe she did , " the Duc told her . " At least that 's what they say . But she only played at catching them . If one came to her hook , she always made some one throw it back . She had such a tender heart , you see . " " Then why did they have to kill her , Papa ? " For answer the Duc only shrugged his broad shoulders . " Why did they , mademoiselle ? " Raynald persisted . " Well , the people were poor and hungry . They thought she and the King spent too much money . It cost a great deal to build just this little hamlet , and then there were the palaces and the fountains and the gardens . After all it was the people 's money , and they did n't like being half starved and poor  --  " " But that 's ridiculous  --  every one ca n't be rich . Some people have to be poor , do n't they ? " Berthe dismissed the whole subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , that 's another question for Mademoiselle to answer . " The Duc gave Henriette a sly smile . " But at least I can see , " he added ,  --  you have n't been making them into little Republicans to fit your own views .  --  " I doubt if Berthe could be made anything but a Royalist , " she told him with amusement . " She was born to the purple , mon/sieur . She and Marie Antoinette would have had much in com-mon . " " They do n't cut off kings ' and queens ' heads any more , do they , Papa ? " Raynald inquired a trifle anxiously . " Not lately , " his father answered . " That 's as much as any one can say . " Berthe and Raynald went off presently to pick wild flowers . The Duc stretched out his long legs and lighted a cigar while Henriette gathered up the luncheon things . For some time neither spoke . There seemed no need for words in the sunny contentmentof the moment . At last he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes following the children as they moved about under the clumps of old trees . " It 's strange , " he said , " that we should be here . I wonder what Marie Antoinette would think of the guests at her hameau today ? " " She would think well of you and your children , monsieur , but not so much of me , I 'm afraid . " " Why do you say that ? " " Because she would be suspicious of me and the world I belong to , even though she came to understand many things and many sorts of people before she died , poor soul . " " You 're inconsistent . You despise what she stood for , yet you say poor soul . ' " " I say poor soul , ' and I mean it . She paid dearly for what she learned too late . " " So do we all . " The old bitterness tinged his voice . " We all pay for experience , and then it 's too late to make use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike in one respect . She was ambitious , Mademoiselle Deluzy , and so arc you . " " I used to think I had ambition , monsieur , but now I 'm not so sure . It may have been only discontent . They 're easily confused . " " And you 're not discontented any more ? " " Not often . It 's only  --  " She broke off uncertainly and then went on : " Sometimes it 's not easy caring for what does n't belong to you . "  | " But once you 've cared for a thing it becomes yours . " " Perhaps , but I used the wrong word . I was really speaking of people . " She looked up and met his eyes . The directness of the look in them made her turn her own away . " It 's not the same , this tending plants whose seeds you have n't sown . Well , that 's what it is to be a governess , monsieur . " She bent to gather up a crumb from the robe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I never mean to sound complaining  --  not today of all days , when I 'm so happy here in this place . " He smiled and shrugged again . " I believe you 're more sentimental about this place than I for all your fine talk of progress and changing times . Do you know , Mademoiselle Deluzy , I was thinking just now that life , like history , has its quiet moments between revolts . " He seldom spoke so gravely , and she was moved by his words . She felt as if he were trying to tell her that he had accepted his own misery ; that he no longer hoped for anything better for himself , except perhaps such brief moments as this , free from reproachesand demands . Resignation always affected her , whether she met it in man or child or beast . She could never bear to see defeat in eyes , or the droop of shoulders bent to any yoke . It was better , she knew , that he should not struggle against his fate . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hope , " he went on after they had both been silent and preoccupied for a while , " that because we 've shared Marie Antoinette'shappiness here , we need not also share her grief . " " Oh , but , monsieur , I do n't believe we can ever really share that . Perhaps it 's the reason why we 're able to forget pain and sorrow , because w , e must always bear them alone . " He turned and regarded her intently . " You 're right , " he said . " Only happiness can be shared with another , and so we remember it , as I shall remember this hour here . " " If only it could last ! " She sighed . " It lasts as long as it 's remembered . " He rose abruptly and went in search of the straying children.  |p244She  watched him move away across the sunny spaces , and his words stayed with her because they were so unlike his usual manner of speaking . It was the last time she was ever to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dread of spying eyes and ears . The long drive back was uneventful , but the children chatteredand waved and remarked on a hundred passing sights . They were late in reaching home ; the lamplighters of Paris were makingtheir rounds ; and the windows of 55 Rue du Faubourg-Saint Honore were already alight . As the carriage clattered into the courtyard , Henriette noticed a figure emerging from the doors . She recognized the tall , black-robed form of the Abbe Gallard . She saw that he watched their arrival , though he did not come forward to greet the Duc and the children . " Bon jour , mon pere , " Raynald called out as he spied him while Berthe curtsied . " Hardly bon jour , my children , " the Abbe responded to their greeting . " The day is already over . I waited till late hoping to see you and hear your prayers . " " Well , there 's tomorrow , is n't there ? " Berthe muttered impatiently . Henriette hoped the Abbe had not heard her . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long day 's outing without impudence being added . The Duc greeted their religious adviser rather hastily , she thought , as she turned to go indoors . Something made her look back , and through the iron grill work she saw that the Abbe had not left the courtyard . Retracing his steps , he followed them into the entrance hall . But he did not continue up the staircase . Instead she saw him turn in the direction of the old Marechal Sebastiani 's private apartments . His soft-shod feet made no sound on the marble floors , and his spare body in its dark garments moved with a sepulchral , unhurried tread , like a black cat going stealthily upon some secret errand of its own . An errand , she felt , that in some way concerned herself.  |p245IT  TAKES ONLY A SMALL SPARK to set the explosive free , and thedynamite of human emotion is no exception to the rule . When the charge is ready , the least friction may light the fuse . For six years the feud between Henriette and the Duchesse had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it was ready to be touched off . The trouble began over a trifling domestic matter , though Henriettehad suspected , ever since her return from the expedition to Versailles , that the old Marechal and the Abbe had joined forces against her . Lisette , one of the two maids in special attendance on the young ladies , happened to be the cause . Lisette had long been a trial to Henriette . She was devoted to the children , particularly to Berthe , but she had an annoying manner of selfimportance , and it pleased her to disregard the governess ' orders whenever possible . Because she had come from Corsica and was the daughter of an old nurse in the Sebastiani household , a bond existed between her and the Duchesse . Lisette knew herself to be a favorite with her mistress , and the knowledge gave her an assurance which could become insolence with the slightest excuse . Henriette had had more than one tilt with her ; but always the maid 's violations of orders had been minor offenses , irritatingto the nerves and disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with Madame . But when Berthe came down with a slight case of jaundice and Lisette paid no attention to the diet ordered by Dr. Simon , Henriette was forced to take action . Berthe had almost recovered when a mysterious relapse occurred . The doctor was baffled till the invalid confessed that she had persuaded the maid to bring her forbidden delicacies from the pantry . Dr. Simon blamed Henriettefor this , and she in turn called Lisette to account.  | " Ah , well , I 'm not going to see the poor young lady starve , " the maid had stolidly maintained . " I do n't care what you and the doctor say , she shall have what she wants to eat so long as I 'm here to fetch it to her . " " In that case you may not be here to disobey orders , " Henriettetold her , taking no notice of the defiant look the maid flung at her as she left the room . She seldom troubled the Duc with domestic problems , and she hesitated to do so just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities . But knowing that Lisette would take further advantage , and that Berthe 's recovery would be hindered , she explained the difficulty to him that night . " She must leave at once , " he decided . " It 's outrageous . Why , she 'll be dosing the child with laudanum next . You should have dismissed her this morning . " " But , monsieur , it 's not my place to do that . You know the Duchesse is very fond of Lisette , and I 'd prefer you discussed it with her first . " He agreed to that reluctantly , and though the maid departed next day , bag and baggage , the effects of her dismissal were farreaching . The Duc and Duchesse quarreled violently as a result . The Duchesse took to her bed for a week while the Duc retaliated by keeping to his own apartments and dining out every night . He did not refer to the subject again , but Henriette guessed that the issue had turned upon herself and her influence in the household , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her Corsican traditions of revenge . Just as the Duchesse emerged and Berthe recovered and peace had been somewhat restored , a new crisis arose . Lisette , it appeared , had gone directly to the newspaper which had printed the first article about the Duc 's affairs , and given her version of the story . She spared no detail that would reflect against MademoiselleDeluzy . Such unsavory items as she omitted , the editors of the scandal sheet were only too ready to supply ; and once more the rift in the Praslin home and the Duc 's infatuationp247for an unscrupulous and scheming governess became common gossip on the Right and Left banks , at court as well as in shops and cafes . News happened to be dull at the moment the story appeared , and for several days each new edition elaborated on the open scandal of such affairs among the highest nobility . There were hints that the Duchesse had lost her reason through humiliationand harsh treatment , that grief had driven her to enter a convent , that she had been denied the privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first conquest of the brazen and beautiful Mademoiselle D. , even that the King himself had threatened to interfere if the Duc persisted in this folly . It so happened that Henriette learned of this latest attack long after the paper that carried it had been read and discussed in the servants ' quarters . The blow fell upon Raynald 's birthday , when she had been particularly busy . Lessons were hurried through beforedejeuner so that the afternoon might be free for celebration . Monsieur Remey had been invited to go with them to a matinee of short plays for children in the Passage Choiseul . The big harouchehad been crowded with full skirts and high spirits as they set off . The June day was sunny , and the trees everywhere in full leaf , but with no hint as yet of summer dust and heat to mar the fresh green . Flowers were blooming everywhere  --  in the parks , on flower stalls , in baskets , window boxes , and on ladies ' bonnets . " How lucky you are to be born in the month of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new linen jacket and trousers and red-topped boots . " Even without presents it would be good fortune . " But Raynald thought presents were very necessary . In fact , on the drive home he decided to share his birthday with Mademoiidleand buy her a gift with his own money . His pockets were burning with francs and ten-franc notes , supplied that morningy his father , his grandfather , and two indulgent Sebastiani rcat-uncles . Nothing would do but that they stop at a small shop ust off the Rue de Rivoli , where they had often watched a jewlercutting cameos.  |p248Raynalds  heart was set on buying a cameo for Mademoiselle , though she tried to dissuade him from such extravagance . Albert Raney was invited to help in the selection while Henriette and the sisters waited in the carriage . The final decision became so child tilt that Henriette had to be called into the shop . " He 's found two small ones the shopkeeper will let him have for half-price , " Albert explained in a whisper . " I doubt if you 'll care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his way . It would never do to curb his generous impulse . " It was dim in the shop after the sunny street , and the cameos were very small and finely cut . The elderly jeweler had been explaining their best points to his small customer . " Now , mademoiselle , it 's for you to choose , " Raynald urged her with a magnificent gesture . It was plain that the boy had taken a fancy to one that showed a monk holding a death 's head against a brownish background . Raynald had reached the age at which human skeletons were fascinating , and there was no denying that the cameo cutter had been very skillful in his portrayal . No wonder , Henriette thought , that the shopkeeper will let him buy it for half-price . It 's hardly a cheerful subject . " You 'll never see one like it anywhere , " the jeweler was saying . Henriette agreed that she doubtless never would , and looking into Raynald 's eyes so eager and shining with pleased generosity , she had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice ! " she murmured to Albert as the cameo was being wrapped in cotton and fitted into a tiny box . " He 's the most unpredictable child . I hope it has n't taken all his money ! " Albert Remey did not answer . She saw that he was bent over a newspaper that lay open on the counter . Something in his expressionstartled her . His mouth had fallen open , and he looked suddenly pale in the dimness of the shop . Her eyes followed his to the article that held his attention , and in a flash she saw the word Praslin and her own name . The printed letters grew larger and larger before her . She felt for the edge of the counter andp249gripped it hard . From a long way off she heard the polite tones of the shopkeeper bidding them good day . " And if Monsieur would care for the paper , I shall be only too delighted to let him take it . I 've finished reading . " " No , no , thank you , monsieur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the distress in his tone and the touch of his hand on her arm . He was urging her out of the shop , but before they reached the door , the dizziness left her . Quickly she turned back to the counter . " If you please , I would like to have that paper if you are quite through with it . " Her hand closed over the sheet . She could see the word Praslin under her fingers . With calm precaution she folded it so that the column was hidden . She could not run the risk of the girls ' sharp eyes seeing that name . Mechanically she heard herself answering questions as they drove the short distance to the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore . Albert sat very quiet in the opposite seat . She avoided meeting his eyes . When they reached the house he made excuse to go back to the schoolroom for some books . As the children started up the stairs he kept at Henriette 's side and spoke in a low voice . " It 's dastardly , this attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible ? " Henriette clutched the paper more tightly , and as she climbed the stairs beside him she gave a grim smile . Lisette 's hatred and vindictive threats at parting had just come to her mind . " I think I know who is behind this latest piece of slander , " she told him . " But that 's no help now . Did you read it all , Albert ? " " Practically , though I was so shocked , coming on it there in the shop , the words hardly made sense to me . But I 'm afraid it 's worse than the others . " " Yes , " she said , " I 'm afraid so . And even if it were not so serious , Monsieur le Duc has so lately been made a member of the House of Peers that it will reflect greater discredit to him . As forp250me -- well She gave a shrug that suggested more than any words she could summon . " I know ; but , 1lenriette , they see you here every day as 1 du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports that you : uul the Duc  --  " He broke off in embarrassment . " Why do you hesitate to say the word ? " she asked bitterly . " All Paris is saying it . " " I know it 's a lie , and I 'm going with you now to tell the Due and Duchesse so . " " No , Albert , no ! You must n't be dragged into this . Nothing you might say could help me , and you would only be hurting yourself . " " I 'll not keep silence while these insults to your good name are bandied about everywhere . I must do something to prove my trust and friendship . " " You 'll have plenty of chances for that , " she told him . Therc was an unnatural grimness in her voice , though her hand shook as she reached out impulsively and laid it on his . " Please go quickly , Albert , and when you return tomorrow act as if you knew nothing . " He stood by the schoolroom door , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes behind his spectacles . " But , mon Dieu , how can I act such a part when you 're in such trouble ? I hardly know what to do . " " Do what I say , please , and remember you 're a scholar , absorbed in your books . You never read newspapers , and you never saw this particular scandal sheet . " Almost without feeling she washed and slipped into fresh clothes . The dress she put on was of pale green challis , strewn with small bright brown flowers the color of her hair . It had been deliveredfrom the dressmaker 's only day before yesterday , yet alreadythat seemed ages ago . " Bien , " she thought as she smoothed her hair before the mirror and fastened on the enameled brooch with the dragon 's headp251which had been the Duchesse 's peace offering to her that first spring in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore . " I look my best tonight , and for what ? But I begin to understand why the condemnedtake such pains with their toilettes when they make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The young people were so gay and talkative they did not apparently notice her preoccupation . She had feared the Duc might take his place , and she felt grateful that it remained empty . It would have been too difficult to sit opposite him , knowing what she knew , what he must surely know also by this time . " We 'll ask Papa to have your cameo set in gold , " Raynald was telling her . " I did n't have money enough for that . And there must be writing on the back . Mamma has that on her brooches and inside her rings . What do you want to have there , mademoi-selle ? " " Why , I do n't know , cheri . I have n't thought . " " They always engrave names and dates , " Berthe explained . " Then we 'll have it say , Raynald , June 18 , 1847 , ' the boy decided , " so you 'll always remember today . " " Even without that , I could n't forget the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamplight . At nine o'clock the summons she had been expecting came : The Marechal Sebastiani 's compliments , and would Mademoiselle I ) eluzy please present herself immediately at his apartments ? Following the servant along the corridors and clown the stairs , she prepared as best she could for the ordeal . They must consider the situation very grave indeed , she decided ; otherwise she would have been called to account by the Duchesse , not by her father . Also the Marechal would have been likely to postpone the interviewtill morning if he had not felt that matters were imperative . Well , at least she preferred father to daughter . A door opened . She found herself entering the Sebastiani drawingroom , where two old men awaited her . There in one chair was the Marechal 's short , soldierly figure and in the other shep252recognized the lean and black-clad Abbe Gallard . The Du ( and Duchcsse were conspicuously absent . A chair was indicated , and she seated herself between them . But as she spread her skirts in decorous folds she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the impression her appearance made . It seemed to her in the tenseness of the slight pause which followed , that these two men , who represented as it were the prosperityof earth and the hosts of heaven , were gathering forces to pass judgment upon her . The Marechal appeared more than ever like the hard , crude Corsican whose shrewdness and energy dominatedthe elegance of his surroundings . But she had less dread of this plain man of action than of the Abbe , who sat motionless , wrapped in his robes and his self-imposed aloofness . His face was turned slightly , and something about his profile struck her as familiar . He reminded her of some one else as he sat silhouetted against the yellow-shaded lamp . It came over her suddenly that he might have posed for the monk 's head on her cameo . There was a pale austerity to the features ; the flesh seemed to have hardened to the same shell-like consistency . She felt that her distaste for the design had been almost prophetic . He only needed the death 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become , studying the resemblance , that she had to force her mind from the Abbe 's profile to the Marechal'swords . " You know , mademoiselle , why we have sent for you ? You have seen the papers ? " " I 've read enough , yes . They 're malicious lies as they were before . " " Lies they may be , " he answered , and a long look of meaning passed between him and the Abbe ; " but this time they have gone too far . We can no longer sit back and accept such insults . " " You say we , ' monsieur , and I am glad of that . I hope it means that you are considering my position in all this . " " Your position has become intolerable to us all . " The dark , deep-set eyes flashed threateningly . " The Abbe agrees with mep253that there is but one course to take . You must leave this house at rice . " There was complete silence in the room  --  the stillness that comes after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , though her body and brain went numb . " One moment ! " she heard her voice speaking at last . " Let me remind you , monsieur , that before matters reached such a serious pass I tried to leave this household of my own free will . But alwaysI was persuaded to stay . Two years ago in Corsica you yourself insisted upon my remaining . You said that would be the surest way to quiet such rumors . " " Evidently I was wrong . These rumors , as you call them , have grown to alarming proportions . " " But you know as well as I do , monsieur  --  and Monsieur ( ' Abbe here also knows  --  that to send me away at this time will put me in a false light . " " Mademoiselle , there are others who come first in our thoughts . " It was the Abbe who spoke this time . He leaned slightly forward in his chair ; and his long , colorless hands lay thin and transparent on his dark robe . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious , and devoted mother  --  a woman who has suffered cruelly because of your presence in her home . " " I 've suffered , too . " Henriette braced herself against the chair . She knew there was no use in making this last stand , but she was determined to go down with her back to the wall . " For six years I 've never known what it was to be trusted or treated with respect and consideration except by Monsieur lc Duc and the children . My devotion to them has been turned into something ugly and false . I 've been spied upon at every turn , and my words and actions doubted and maligned till I was tried almost past the point of endurance . " " Yes , mademoiselle , " the Abbe answered with a faintly sardonicinflection . " I have often marveled at your endurance . It will undoubtedly prove valuable to you in your next situation . But I happen to be more concerned with the Duchesse and her welfarep254than with your difficulties . I can not stand by any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ostracized by those she loves , who are bound to her by holy ties . " " Holy ties are one thing , and I honor them , but they do n't take the place of love that springs from sympathy and confidence . We ca n't command the love of others ; we must earn it , monsieur , as we earn the right to be loved . I 'm sorry for the Duchesse . I 've honestly tried to make allowances for her ill health and temperament . I 'm not passing judgment upon her now . If she is a reclusein her home , as you say , it 's because she has made herself so . Her own moods have created the prison walls that keep her dear ones from her . " " Mademoiselle , we are not here to discuss personalities . You have many gifts , but evidently humility does not seem to be one of them . " " Humility does n't help much when one has one 's living to make . " Henriette refused to be brushed aside as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow . " Be that as it may , " the Abbe continued frigidly , " the Marechal and I are agreed that you can not remain here . " " Yes , yes , we must be practical , " the other hurried on . " It 's not only my daughter 's distress and the humiliation of this latest attack , but the Duc is now in public life ; and such things reflect on the Court and on the King himself . A repetition of such scandal might have very serious effects , and we must think of the future . " " I must think of the future , too . Whether it affects the Court of France or not , it happens to matter to me . " " Certainly , mademoiselle . " Her irony was lost on the Marechal , but not , she hoped , on the Abbe . " That 's what I say  --  we must be practical , and of course I will see that you do not suffer finan-cially . " " But what about my prospects , monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make it almost impossible for me to secure another teaching post in France . "  | " Exactly . That 's why it will be better for you to go to England , where I understand you have influential friends . Surely they will he able to find you more congenial employment than if you remained in Paris . We have decided that will be the best plan , and I am prepared to help you financially if you agree . " " So I 'm to be shipped out of the country , like other undesirables . No , thank you , monsieur . You have a right to ask me to leave your house , but not to leave France . " " Wait , " the Marechal interposed , his face flushing purple at her words . " You must hear me out . In view of your services to my grandchildren I intend to provide you with a comfortable settlement . " " Please do n't misunderstand me , " Henriette broke in . " I was not the one to bring up this matter of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mademoiselle . By leaving now I understand you will forfeit a pension the Duc promised if you would stay till the older girls married . " " I did not stay because of that . All I ask now is a fair chance to continue my work without prejudice . " " That 's why you will do well to go to England , and with an assured annuity from me you should be able to manage comfortablyfor yourself . Shall we say twelve hundred francs a year ? " " I 'm not talking about francs or about England , monsieur . I shall stay in France  --  in Paris , probably ; and I ask for no bribes . I only want the assurance that what has happened while I worked in this house will not injure what means most to a governess  --  her good character . " " You should have thought of your character before tonight , " the Abbe interposed . " I 'm afraid we can not give that back to you unspoiled . It seems to me the Marechal is being more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for charity of the Marechal or any one here . But I do ask the privilege of earning my living where and how I choose . If I could have been allowed to stay the summer out , or until this unfortunate matter died down , it would have beenp256easier ; however , that 's not for me to say . But a letter from l hr Duchesse recommending me is very important . I think I deservethat after these six years of service . " " You make it difficult . " The Marechal 's thick fingers drummed on the arm of his chair . " Very difficult . I still advise your going to England . You will not consider that ? " " No , monsieur , I prefer France . I 've never believed in running away from trouble . " " Well , then , there 's nothing more to be said . " " And you will speak to the Duchesse about the letter . Tell her I will be out of the house tomorrow , but I will leave word where it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together as if they were two peasants haggling in some market place . Yet she knew she was fighting for her rights , that her whole future was at stake . " I will speak to my daughter , " he agreed hesitantly , " but I ca n't answer for her . She 's been tried too far . " " The Duchesse is noted for her goodness of heart , " Henriette pointed out as she rose . " I 'm sure she wo n't begrudge me a few words of honorable discharge . She might even be generous enough to let it appear that I left for reasons of my own . " " You go too far , mademoiselle , " the Abbe once more answeredfor his friend . " It 's not your place to dictate terms with those who have suffered so long from your arrogance and conceit . It seems to me that you protest your innocence too vigor-ously . " The Abbe 's cool denunciation stung her as all the furies of the Duchesse had never been able to do . She flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't do that , monsieur . I could n't speak too vigorously against these lies . " " You talk glibly of lies , but let me remind you that there are others than those uttered by word of mouth or set on paper . For these unspoken ones we are also held to account as you will bep257for the suffering you have caused another  --  a good woman whose prayers you have turned into a mockery . " The Abbe sighed deeply and raised his eyes  --  almost , Henriette thought , as if he were enlisting allies from above to his side . She knew she was helpless before the power of this man , yet she was determined to have the last word . " Monsieur , " she said , " you may not know that I , too , am accountableto a father confessor . It happens to be my own conscience , and a clear conscience may also give absolution . " She did not remember bidding the two good night or leaving the Sebastiani apartments . She had no idea if the interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew only that for her this was the end of an era , and it seemed strange to find the older girls still busy under the lamplight with their books and embroidery and games about them . " Oh , there you are , mademoiselle ! " Louise sprang up as she entered . " Papa was here a few moments ago , but he could n't stay . He wrote a note and told me not to forget to give it to you . What 's the matter , mademoiselle ? You look pale , and your hands are so cold . " " Well , I might as well tell you , my dears . " She sank down in the midst of the little group . " I 've had bad news tonight . " " Oh , mademoiselle , I 'm sorry ! You 're not ill ? " " No . " She tried to smile a reassurance she did not feel as she hastily sought for some logical explanation . " I 'm as well as usual ; but my grandfather is ill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she argued to herself , remembering the Abbe 's recent words on the subject of lies , " it 's the truth in one way . He is ill , and it 's not my place to go into facts . By tomorrow it wo n't be my place to tell them anything . " " But you 'll come back soon ? " She faltered under the searching gaze of those clear young eyes . " I ca n't say when  --  it may be a long time . " " Why , mademoiselle ! It 's queer I never knew you had a grandfather . You never spoke of him to us before . "  | " Why should I , my dear ? It did n't concern you . " " Oh , but , mademoiselle , everything that concerns you concerns us . " Their sympathy and affection unnerved her more than the shock of the newspaper , more than the interview that had just ended . She had difficulty in restraining their generous offers of help in packing . They wanted to go to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They showered her with embarrassingquestions about her grandfather , his illness , and the probablelength of her stay . She answered them as best she could . But all the time the slim , girlish bodies in full pink and blue and sprigged muslin pressed about her , all the time the quick , young voices buzzed in her ears , she was telling herself that this was the end . They would never be together like this again , gathered round the lamp-lit table where they had refought campaigns of long dead armies and waged more personal wars against columns of figures and the vagaries of irregular verbs . " Going  --  gone ; going  --  gone , " the familiar brown clock ticked like an auctioneer'shammer to Henriette . She went through the ordeal of good night , set the schoolroom to rights , and reached her own quarters at last . It was only then , with the door locked against possible interruption , that she dared to read the letter Louise had delivered . Except for two or three brief notes giving her impersonal directions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was without address , and she saw that the penciled words had been hastily scribbled on a sheet of ruled paper from one of the girls ' copy books : I feel much , and there is nothing to say ; nothing that I can do . My hands are tied , and I am powerless to help you , my dear friend , as your support has so often helped me . Misfortune has marked me for her own , and whatever move I make I seem to bring disaster upon others , especially upon you , whom I most wish to spare . It is as you so truly said  --  we can only share happiness , not grief ; and yet I know that I am responsible for the ordeal you must meet alone . But re/member , I , too , am alone . Small comfort indeed , but perhaps you can make something of it . You are braver than I. I do not fear for you as I do for myself . Keep the older girls informed of your whereabouts , and be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive this poor note . There was no signature , and her own name had not been written . Even on this last night of her stay there , she guessed that he had not dared so great a risk . The words showed signs of haste and agitation . Some were black and heavy , some light ; and the pencil point had broken in one place under the pressure of those strong fingers . She hesitated by the little secretary , wondering if she should write a discreet answer to his letter . But she decided against that . Even the most politely formal note might be misinterpreted ; and , besides , he evidently wished to forestall that impulse , so expressly did he ask her to tell the children where she meant to go . Poor soul , he was afraid of further consequences . She smiled wanly at that . He had deserted her . But she could not reproach him . He could ' lo nothing by taking a stand . He was not brave , as he himself Ltd admitted . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was afraid of the dark . She had given him her hand , and they had taken comfort in each other 's nearness . That was all that had ever been between them . And now that , too , was gone . The time had come for her to go away . After a little she moved to the window and opened it . Below her the garden lay dark and warm with June fragrance , and from the distance the familiar sounds of Paris came to her  --  the dwindledhoofbeats and the clatter of carriages on the Champs Elysees , the pulse of the city she was determined not to leave . She turned back to the room , fetched her night clothes from the closet , and with a quick impulsive gesture blew out the lamp . She undressed in the dark because she did not wish to look about those rooms where she had experienced such varying emotions for six years . She would not sentimentalize about each object thatp260had been part of her life there  --  the little gilt clock under the glass dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh-cut flowers , and the mirror that had reflected her face in moments of delight and perplexity and fear . No , she would not brood upon what was over for good and all . " It 's misery enough , " she thought as she pressed her face against the cool pillow , " to have once been happy here . "  | BACK TO THE RUE DU HARLAY ; to the sloping eaves and crampedquarters of the Needle 's Eye . It seemed narrower and shabbier after the luxurious apartment in the Faubourg-Saint-Honore , where Henriette had grown used to down pillows and fine linen and upholstered furniture . She had not realized how insidiously such comforts could become necessities . She had steeled herself to meet the loneliness and depression and sense of defeat which she knew would inevitably follow her departure ; but she had not guessed the physical repugnance she would experience in the noise and heat and squalor of that dilapidated establishmentin the Marais . The fact that she was lucky to have even this refuge did not lessen her gloom , though Madame Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , " the old woman had greeted her a month before , " here you are bag and baggage , just as I 've been expecting you to turn up on my doorstep some day . You held out longer than I thought you would , but it was bound to end like this . I told you so . " " You did , Madame Le Maire . " Henriette had smiled wearily . " I 'll always give you credit for that . " " And now you 're asking for another kind of credit , I suppose . " " Not yet . I 've been able to put by a little money . I can pay my way , but of course summer is a bad time to find another place . It may be a long wait , and meantime  --  " " And meantime you must live , and there are n't so many pensionsin Paris that will care to open their doors to the notorious Mademoiselle D. now she 's left the HStel Praslin ! No , you need n't go into explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of Albert Remey . " Henriette had given her unspoken gratitude to Albert when she heard that he had already been there to intercede for her.  |p263He  and Marie had begged her to come to them , but she had refused . She would not bring her misfortune into their household , though she had been touched by their offer and their loyal support . As briefly as possible she had told Madame Le Maire of her difficulties . It had been strange to hear herself humbly asking for the privilege of room and board and a chance to teach or chaperonany of the boarders . But she had laid her case calmly before the old woman without asking for sympathy . She would pay her way , and she would work at anything for the present . She asked nothing more than that . " Well , Mademoiselle Desportes "  --  Madame had pronounced her old name with peculiar emphasis  --  " any one else in my place would refuse you . It 's not only the scandal which always leaks out sooner or later , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they always will . " " Can I help that ? " Henriette had asked . " I did n't say you could , and in a way it 's what I 've always liked about you . When I was young they used to say people only threw stones at the tree that was loaded with fruit . " This grudgingly admitted compliment had been Madame 's only assurance that Henriette might remain even in the dubious security of that least desirable room . She had made no promises about keeping her , and as the weeks passed and the letter of recommendation from the Duchesse did not materialize the old woman became more insistent . Although there had been no writtenagreement about this , Henriette had been assured verbally before leaving that it would be given her . She had written the Duchesse reminding her of this and giving the Rue du Harlay address , and she had also mentioned it to the Duc at each of their two meetings . These had been brief and difficult , and the presence of the tearfulchildren , who clung to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Melun , had not made conversation easy . Berthe and Raynald would not be reconciled to her absence , and these reunions only left her more exhausted and despairing . Shep263wrote several letters to Louise ; letters which echoed her misery , and which she hoped might be shown to the Duc . Not that she counted on his help , but it eased her a little to put her loneliness on paper ; to ask for news and reassurance of their affection duringthose intervals between the unsatisfactory visits . Once she found her emotions carrying her too far , and she left a sentence unfinished that she had begun in a transport of unhappiness . Still she must think of her pupils before herself . Louise was to be married in early autumn , and she must not be burdened with an exgoverness ' plight . On a stifling night in late July , Henriette lay sleepless on her hard bed . Up there under the roof that narrow box of a room gathered heat by day and stayed like an oven till morning . If any breeze stirred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gabled window of the Needle 's Eye or helped to clear the air of stale smells of past cooking and the faint stench of sewer gas . Henriette pressed a damp handkerchief to her nostrils and tried not to listen as the hours and half-hours struck through the closepressingdarkness . Her eyelids felt hot and swollen , her lips were salty from hours of crying . But she had no more tears to shed , though her breath still came convulsively . She tried to keep it quiet , for two of the maids slept next door , and they had complainedthat her restlessness and weeping kept them awake . MadameLe Maire was already displeased with her . The old landlady 's patience was wearing thinner each day that passed without the arrival of the Duchesse 's letter , and that very night at dinner Henriettehad further annoyed her by having to leave the table because she had been overcome by a wave of faintness . The afternoon had not helped her fortitude . It was her second reunion with her former pupils and their father , and each meetinghad upset her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Raynald to the dentist because her presence and encouragement had always helped them through such ordeals . It had been like old times , and she had forgotten her own troubles for those few hours . After the visit to the dentist they had gone to the Luxem/bourg Gardens . The Duc had joined them , and they had cater frappes and listened to a band concert under the trees . But it 11:1 ( 1 been an unsatisfactory meeting . He had seemed grim and strained , and spoke little . She guessed that he dared not trust himself to reopen the painful subject of her departure . The King was away from Paris , and the House of Peers did not claim his attention . This was a pity , she had thought , since it gave him too much time to brood on the hopeless tangle of his own domestic affairs . He had been solicitous for her , commenting upon her paleness and lassitude . He had urged her to take a brief holiday from the city , or at least to let Dr. Simon prescribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of this . It was the heat , she had explained ; once the weather grew cooler , she would be able to sleep again  --  better yet if she could only find some work to absorb her . It was then that she had reminded him of the promised letter from the Duchesse . There had been no sign of it , and Madame Le Maire was becoming more pressing in her demands . There were several young ladies in the pension who wished instruction in English and painting . She had started a small class , but she could not continue without good references from her last position , since the young ladies had been entrusted to Madame 's care . She had waited a month now , and she had even written reminding the Duchesse ; but no word had come . He had flushed darkly , his brows drawn into deep lines . It was outrageous that the Duchesse had not kept to the agreement . He would take the matter up with her at once . " I would not be so insistent , monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a right to ask that much of her . It 's so little for her to do , and it means my whole future to me . " " You shall have your letter , " he had promised as they walked together from the Gardens . " Make sure that I shall see to that if it 's my last act on earth . " The children had begged her to drive with them to the depot of the Corbeil railway , and she had consented against her will.  | There had been the inevitable tears when the parting took place at the train gates . She had not been able to keep back her own tears as Berthe and Raynald clung to her . " Try to be happy if you can , " the Duc had said in parting . " It only makes it harder for me to know you are miserable , too . " " I 'll try , " she had promised . " Night after night as I lie awake I say to myself : Why should you expect to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And yet , somehow , I go right on believing that it is my right . " He had pressed her hand , and then she had turned away from the little group going down the long platform . The tears in her eyes made everything indistinct . On her way out she had collided with a man hurrying towards the train . " Pardon , " she had murmured . Looking up , she had seen that he was the Due 's valet , Auguste Charpentier . He had recognized her , she knew , and she wished that he had not seen her crying . Well , the afternoon was over . The precious minutes had only been wasted with useless tears and regrets . She would nut waste any more . A near-by clock was striking three . She must try to catch a little sleep . She would have need of that to face another day . But the bed was so hard , the room so hot . She turned and twisted endlessly . This was the hour before daylight , when she was trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own vitality ebbed away in the darkness . The little clock that the children had chosen for her one Christmas ticked tirelessly on a shelf she could not see . Time mocked her so , night after night . She was afraid to think of the past or of the future . Both were painful to her now . There was only the present , and what was that that she should cling to it ? After a while she slipped from bed to crouch by the window as she had done through other wakeful hours . But no freshness rewardedher as she leaned at the casement , peering into the hollow pit of the street below where the opposite houses stood dark and lifeless and only a lamp glimmered feebly at the corner . Some/times a stealthy gray rat sped across that circle of light ; sometimes a slow , stooped human figure passed and was gone . Even at this distance such shapes filled her with shudders of pity and disgust . The rats of Paris going upon their secret missions were less repellent than these other night scavengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their shame begun , and where , she wondered , would it end ? Where would she herself end , for the matter of that ? Everything came back to that . Every sight and every sound stabbed her with the sharpness of personal futility . She leaned her arms on the window ledge and buried her face upon them to shut out the vision of interminably stretching years . What could they bring but a shifting from post to post ? Board and rooms in exchange for the best years of her life ; her capacity for love spent on other people 's children , and if they loved her in return , only bitterness and hard feelings for reward . She would grow withered and querulous like other aging mesdemoiselles , and in time give herself up to fancywork and tedious reminiscences . She would share with her kind such crumbs of gentility as they could muster . Dullness would be her heritage . All her strug. gles against it had only brought the specter nearer . She could feel it at her heels . There in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Henriette Deluzy . Henriette Desportes , spinster . " She repeated the words with ruthless emphasis on the last one . Thirty-five years old , and alone . So she might live to be an old woman . Spinsters often did . They had so little to spend themselvesupon . " Mon Dieu , never let it be so for me ! " She writhed at the thought , and sweat broke out on her brow and under the folds of her nightgown , though she continued to pant for breath in the closeness of the room . He had said she had courage . Perhaps she had , but not enough to face that . When life held nothing , nothing that one wanted , where was the harm in letting it go ? Not to worry , not to schemep267and scrimp , not to compromise with one 's self while the eagerness of youth died a slow death in unwanted flesh  --  that was all that mattered now . God would not be too hard on her . He had created a world of beauty and had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could not have meant it to turn out this way for her . If He really did know the secrets of all hearts there would be no need to explain things to Him . The bottle of laudanum was in the top drawer of the chest . She knew just where she had hidden it in her handkerchief case . It was a small , squat bottle , but nearly full . Dr. Simon had entrusted it to her care during one of Berthe 's illnesses , and he had explainedhow fatal an overdose might be . Her mind had stored away his words , and now they and the bottle were ready to answerher need . The drawer stuck obstinately under her hands . It seemed to be thwarting her in an almost human manner as she struggled to open it without disturbing those in the next room . She heard the rustle of a mattress as one of the sleepers stirred . Her hands found the bottle , and she stood there holding it close while she made sure that the steady breathing continued from the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those few inches of plaster would divide the living from the dead . Noiselessly she moved to the washstand under the eaves and felt for the tumbler and pitcher of water .. . Some one groaned . She was aware of the long , shuddering sound of distress before she realized that she herself had made it . She strained to raise her eyelids , but a blinding light and a blur of faces that looked larger than full moons turned her dizzy again . A wave of nausea overcame the blackness , and sharp odors and still sharper pangs made her conscious once more . " There now ! " she heard Madame Le Maire 's familiar voice faintly through a haze of pain . " She 's through the worst of it . We need not send Pierre for a doctor . Get downstairs as fast as you can . " Another spasm shook Henriette , and when it passed and she was able to fix her attention on nearer objects she saw that shep268was still in the Needle 's Eye , blinking painfully at the strange brightness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light mingling with that of a lamp on the stand beside her bed . " Madame , " she whispered , " how did you know ? Why did you have to come ? " " Why ? " The answer came short with annoyance as the old woman rubbed her vigorously with wet towels or pressed smellingsalts to her nostrils . " Have n't you given me enough trouble without adding suicide ? You might have thought of what a police report would mean to my business . But Jeannette has sharp ears , praise Heaven ! She heard you fall and the glass shatter , and we lost no time . Here , lift your arms , and let me get you into a clean nightdress . " In spite of the brusque words and manner Henriette knew that Madame was being very kind as she made her clean and comfortableand later forced her to drink black coffee with a dash of brandy . She lay limp and exhausted , scarcely aware of those who came and went , though she knew that Madame and the maids and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bed , urgingher to eat the food they brought and fanning her to keep away the flies . Sometimes she slept , and woke drenched with sweat , beating off the black wings of ugly dreams . Towards eveningher head cleared , and the air freshened as a summer shower cooled the streets . She lay back weakly and turned to Madame Le Maire with a faint , apologetic smile . " Forgive me , madame , for making you so much trouble , " she faltered . " I know now that I have been very weak and foolish . " " It 's something to admit one 's folly . ' Well , you 're alive whether you want to be or not . " " It 's no use trying to explain , but I was desperate . " " So I gather . I mistrusted it from the way you looked at dinner last night . You were seeing them most of yesterday . I suppose that accounts for it . " " Perhaps , madame . But nothing happened . They are not to  |p269blame  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there was no use in my going on . " " So you tried laudanum . Well , you 're not the first . But it 's not so easy as all that , Henriette Desportes . Life does n't mean to be cheated of you . " Tears of weakness gathered in Henriette 's eyes . She found it difficult to speak , but after a time she mastered her sobs and went on . " It was wrong , I know , but there are times when  --  when tomorrow , even one more hour , seems too much . I could n't sleep . You know how it is after you 've counted every stroke of the clock and your troubles grow like a mountain and you can see nothing else . " " Most certainly I know . " Madame wagged her head so vigorouslythat her fringe of black hair shifted slightly over one eye . " Who does n't ? " Again they were silent for a time , and only the sounds of venderscalling their wares from the wet street below sounded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see , " Henriette ventured at last . " If there had been some one to turn to , some one for me to lean on . " " Listen to me . " The sharp old eyes blinked fiercely out of their nests of wrinkles . " You 'll never find that , so stop wasting your time looking for shoulders to lean on . " " But  --  but other people have that comfort . Why should n't I ? " " Because your shoulders were made for them to lean on . You were born a prop and not a vine . You ca n't go against your pattern as you tried to last night . Believe me , mademoiselle , I know what I 'm saying . An oak may not turn into a strawberry plant for the wishing . "  |p270IT  WAS MID-AUGUST , and in the Rue du Harlay Madame LeMaire 's dinner had been over nearly an hour . At least the tables had been cleared ; the halls and parlors and draperies were still reminiscent of cabbage and onion , fried fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles of sewing about her , paused at intervalsto wipe the moisture from the needle she forced through the coarse cotton sheets she was hemming . She pressed her handkerchief to her nose , and the sharp fragrance of cologne revived her enough to go on for another brief period of work . She sat in Madame 's small parlor , separated by folding doors from the drawingroom where a group of students were trying to while away another dull summer evening . Most of the students were females , and a more nondescript and unattractive lot Henriette thought she had never seen . The three male residents of the pension had gone out immediately upon finishing dinner , and a dispiriting lull had settled down upon the rest . They read or wrote letters , embroideredor gossiped while several more musically inclined took turns at the square piano . But this music failed to enliven the scene . No players were gifted or even very accurate , and the piano needed tuning . Henriette tried to shut the sound from her consciousness ; but it was impossible not to wince when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to budge . Usually she sat with the students , chaperoning or assisting them at their various occupations . But tonight she had been spared that . It was a luxury to be allowed to sew by herself while she waited for the announcement of special visitors . Flies buzzed incessantly about the oil lamp . It was very hot in the small parlor , but she was growing used to that , now the summer had dragged two-thirds through . She had become accustomed to many things that in June had seemed unendurable.  | " Well ? " Madame Le Maire surveyed her from the doorway . " No sign of your visitors yet ? You 're sure you made no mis-take ? " " No , madame . " Henriette looked up from the long hem under her hands . " Louise wrote plainly the 17th of August : " " I 've told Pierre to not keep them waiting . They 're to be shown up here immediately . I must speak to the girls next door , but I 'll be back directly . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they arrive . " The brisk old figure rustled away , and presently her orders were being issued in the next room . Henriette 's ears were strained for the rattle of a carriage stopping outside , for the peal of a bell and the sound of familiar voices on the stairs . She had faced much in the last three weeks since she had seen them . The episodeof the laudanum bottle had left its mark upon her spirit , though it had not injured her physically , thanks to the maid 's and Madame 's prompt action . But the starch had gone out of Henriette , temporarily at least . She was even ready to compromisenow if need be . There would be no other way if Madame failed tonight in her demand of the letter . All day she had waited , restless and yet in a state of suspended activity , knowing that her fate would be decided before another day passed . Almost , it seemed to her as she pushed the needle in and out with precise , even stitches , that her future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down her ultimatum , not unkindly , but with a firmness that Henriette knew would never be shaken . The letter must be guaranteed . She would speak to the Duc herself since Henriette 's efforts had not been successful . There had been nothing to do but agree to this arrangement , much as she disliked the old woman 's meddling . " Forget those fine stitches you learned in the convent , " Madame was saying presently . " These sheets will never be worth the pains you 're putting on them . What 's the time ? Nearly nine . Well , I must say they might have paid you the compliment of coming before this . "  |p272A  quarter of an hour later they heard the sounds of arrival . Before the sewing could be laid aside the children had run up the stairs with eager cries for " Mademoiselle Deluzy . " Berthe and Raynald were first with flowers in their hands ; Louise and Marie came next ; last of all came the Duc , bearing a basket of fruit and one of the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling to keep herself in hand when so much depended upon her tonight . She took as long as possible with the young people 's greetings before she turned to their father . When the introductions to Madame Le Maire were over , they fitted themselves into the parlor as best they could , the chairs occupied by the adults , the children squeezed close together on a horsehair sofa . The room seemed suddenly too small to hold all this influx of life and good looks and expensive clothes . It was like a pot on a hot stove ready to boil over in another moment . Henriettefelt her head begin to swim as she tried to answer the eager , bubbling questions of the young Praslins ; to listen to the conversation of Madame and the Duc on her other side , and to keep her eyes from turning in his direction . " Oh , these roses and heliotrope ! " She buried her face in the fragrant bouquets . " Berthe , you remembered how I love mignonette , and this is the first bit I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the fruit , mademoiselle ; we wanted you to have the first peaches , and the grapes grew in the new conservatory . The strawberries are all gone , and the blackberries were too green to pick . But this melon will ripen if you keep it in the sun . It was the biggest on any of the vines . " Over their quick mingled voices she strained to catch what the other two were saying . Had they reached the point yet ? Was Madame leading tactfully to the matter of the letter ? " You are pale , mademoiselle , " Louise was saying , " and your eyes look  --  " " Oh , you 've just forgotten how I look , " Henriette broke in hastily . They must not ask if she had been crying.  | " I 've done a study of flowers , mademoiselle : yellow and white lilies and purple iris in a green jar . The flowers were easy , but the jar was hard to do  --  to make both sides look the same . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you make a great many more sketches at the seashore  --  shells and seaweed and ships . The other day I was looking at the ones I did in my old sketchbook at Olmeto , and they made me quite homesick . " Chit chat , chit chat . Flowers and shells and such , when her heart felt as if it were tied fast in a double knot , when her throat was aching and her lips felt dry , holding back all the words of love and homesickness and longing that she must never say . " Oh , yes , thank you , mademoiselle , the others are all well . At least all except Mamma . She 's been poorly since we went to the chateau . Dr. Simon and Dr. Louis came from Paris to see her . It was their idea to go to Dieppe . But we have a much larger villa than the old one . You remember that other where  --  " " Yes , yes , I remember , " Henriette once more interposed hastily . " And you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after . The others went straight to the Faubourg-Saint-Honore , except Mamma and the boys . They were going to the booksellers on the Rue du Coq first . Mamma wants to take some new novels with her . " " I see . And you have good news from Isabella ? She wrote me a sweet letter a fortnight ago . Louise , you look blooming . Has your wedding day been finally settled upon ? " From behind the folding doors the murmurs of the boarders sounded with occasional shrill giggles . The piano began again . They could scarcely talk above it . Madame rose , excused herself , and went in to put a stop to that . " This is a funny little parlor you have , mademoiselle , and where do you sleep ? " " Hush , Raynald , do n't ask such questions . " " Oh , never mind , monsieur . It 's no secret . This parlor belongs to Madame . She only invites me to share it if I have company , and when I sleep , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p274my  room is high up among the chimneypots . The melon will ripen nicely there , almost as soon as if it were in your green-house . " Shc broke off quickly , seeing the surprised pity in the chiIdren'seyes and realizing she had admitted too much . She had meant the Duc to hear , and he had . She saw him shift uneasily in his chair . " Mademoiselle Deluzy "  --  he spoke hurriedly and glanced towards the hall to make sure their hostess had not returned  --  " I am greatly worried about you . Your health has suffered . I should have guessed that even if Madame had not told me you have been ill . " He looked at her intently , and she knew he must be referringto the laudanum . " You must see Dr. Simon at once , and you must accept my offer to send you on a little holiday . Please let me help you . " There was a note of appeal in his voice , yet once more she could not continue to look into his eyes . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into heavy , listless lines , but his eyes showed his own inner tension . " Well , monsieur , " she sighed and made a little futile gesture with her hands , " there 's only one thing that can help me . I supposeMadame Le Maire has already told you . " He had only time to nod before the old woman was in their midst again . Once more Henriette turned to the group on the sofa , and there were further inquiries and answers . " How is your sick grandfather , mademoiselle ? Will he soon be better so you can come back ? " " I ca n't say , cherie . You must n't count on my coming back . " " Oh , but we do ! We do n't want any other governess . Monsieur Remey can teach us till you come back  --  all except painting . He 's not very good at that . " Berthe 's sudden laughter filled the room with clear , untroubled gayety . Ten o'clock . A distant clock struck , and the Duc rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the room ! Thep275bric-a-brac and furniture seemed nothing but a clutter of flimsy feminine trash by contrast , sticks and straw and bits of china that lie could demolish by a single sweep of his hands . " Good night , madame , and I thank you for the honor you have done me . Come , Louise , Marie , Berthe , Raynald . It 's late , and we must make our adieus . " " Good night , Monsieur le Duc , " Madame Le Maire peered up at him , looking in her rusty black rather like an aged and scrawny crow . " It was most considerate of you to come tonight , and I hope I 've made my situation clear . " " Perfectly clear , madame , though as I said , in case of a slight delay  --  " " There 's been two months ' delay already . It 's not that I 'm being insistent . You understand how it is when I 'm responsible to others and with the circumstances what they are . " " I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will do my best . Good night . " Henriette followed the five to the head of the stairs . She kissed the soft faces turned up to hers and then stood with her hands on the stair rail , searching his face under the flickering hall light . " Do n't take what she says too much to heart , monsieur , " she told him . " I know better than any one else the position you are being placed in because of me , because of this letter . " " I 've tried already . " His voice was low beside her . " I 've done everything in my power , but I play a sorry part in all this . " " Madame la Duchesse has found a way to punish me . She can force me to leave here , and she 'll probably end by getting her way . " " She has put you out of the house . Is n't that enough ? " " Apparently not , monsieur . But , please , be careful what you say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the room they had just left , but he caught her hand . " I will make one more effort , " he promised . " Perhaps if I go to her now  --  tonight , she will listen to reason . "  | " Do n't count on it , monsieur . " She could not keep her voice . altogether steady as she went on : " Do n't go too far for my sake . " " Papa  --  Papa , " the children were calling from below . " Are n't you coming ? It 's very dark down here , and we ca n't find the door knob . " " In a moment , " he answered . Then he turned to her once more . " Come to the Faubourg-Saint-Honore tomorrow about two o'clock . I can make no promises , but perhaps by then  --  Well , we shall see . Good night till tomorrow . " His boots clattered down the stairs . " Good night , mademoiselle , " the young voices called u ' p to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till tomorrow then , at two . " Madame Le Maire looked up as she returned to the parlor . " Well ? " she asked with that rising inflection whose meaningHenriette knew . " I 'm to go to the Faubourg-Saint-Honore at two o'clock tomorrow . That 's all I know . But I 'm not counting too much on that . " She reached for the half-finished sewing and took up the needle and thread . " I-le 's a very fine figure of a man , " the old woman remarked after they had stitched in silence for some time . " I do n't wonder the Duchesse wanted to catch him early . He must have been very handsome when he was young . " " He 's not so old . " Henriette tried to speak casually as she threaded her needle . " Forty-two . That 's young to be a grandfather , but he will be soon . " " Grandfather or not , he 'd better watch where he 's heading . " Madame bit off the thread emphatically before she went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you credit . I do n't envy the Mademoiselle who comes next after the fuss they made over you . " Henriette refused to be drawn into further conversation about the visit . When the sewing was done , she divided her fruit and flowers with Madame and climbed the stairs to her room . She felt spent from the evening and yet strangely calm and settled in herp277mind as she put the drooping flowers into water and set the basket of fruit with the melon on her window sill . The early sun would ripen it in a day or two , and she would share the delicacy with Albert and Marie . They had been begging her to make them a little visit , and she guessed that the time was not far off when she would be glad to accept their invitation . The Duc would never be able to secure that letter . It had been foolish to cling to the hope of it so long . The Duchesse was taking the revenge she had waited for all these years . It was consistent with her Corsican heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been clever enough to plan so subtly cruel a way . Out of the hopeless tangle of their lives this power had been put into the Duchesse 's plump , ineffectual hands . Merely by a few pen strokes she could give Henriette back her independenceand good name . By refusing them she could make her into an exile , and her future a downhill road . Well , there must be some way out . There came a time when one could no longer struggle against difficulties not of one 's own making . She had plunged hopefully into a maelstrom of human emotions . It was not strange that she had been caught between the fierce crosscurrentsof these two lives till she was blind and dizzy , battered by her efforts to keep her own head above water . For six years she had been part of this dark and dangerous whirlpool , but now she was on land again ; she would turn her back on all that . The ground still felt uncertain under her feet , but it would grow firmer in time if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must n't try to hop against the hill at first , " she told herself . " One step after another , and there 's less chance of slipping . And I will not look back . " She hung her dress up with more care than she had taken since her return to the Ru du Harlay , smoothing its crisp silk folds with the stripes of blue against the gray background . It was such a pretty dress , yet already it seemed years ago that she had chosen it  --  not barely four months before . Standing presently in her nightgown before the blurred square of looking-glass she mar/veled that she should still be able to recognize herself . Outwardly she had not changed . Her face showed paler and thinner ; but the faint shadows about her eyes were not unbecoming , and her loosened hair still shone in the candlelight . She blew out her candle and lay down in the darkness . The air outside had freshened slightly ; the Needle 's Eye was less oppressive . A great weariness and relaxation overtook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were closed . There must he some way out of her difficulties . Tomorrow she would face them with new eyes . She would write to the Hislop family in England and ask their help . The Reverend Frederic Monod would return in another week , and she would explain everything to him . Perhapshe could find her work even in France . And meantime she would sleep as she had not slept in many weeks . Already her breath came more easily , and the gentle bliss of unawareness crept upon her . She scarcely stirred , so deep and dreamless was her sleep . Dawn slipped into Paris , into the Rue du Harlay . Milkmen with their carts rattled over the cobblestones , and early venders began their morning rounds . The sun rose red above the clustered chimneypots , touching them to brightness , finding the basket of fruit on the window ledge with the melon waiting to be ripened . But still Henriette slept though , many flights below her , old Pierre hobbled out to answer the insistent jingling of the house bell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quick hurrying footsteps and heavier ones . Some one knocked sharply at her door . The door knob was frantically shaken . " Henriette ! Henriette , wake up ! Please hurry . It 's I , Albert Remey . " " Get up , mademoiselle , and let us in before we rouse the house . " Still only half awake , she stumbled to the door and unbolted it . Wide-eyed , she stood there in her long white nightgown , her hair flowing on her shoulders , her feet bare . Madame Le Maire had thrown a heavy shawl over her own nightrobe , and for oncep279her scanty graying knot of hair was unrelieved by the luxuriant black false front . That , more than all other signs of agitation , alarmed Henriette . Madame must be at the last extremity to have forgotten that . " Shut the door , Albert , " the old woman commanded , " and come in . This is no time for worrying about the proprieties . " " But what is it ? What are you doing here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's bad news , Henriette . I came as soon as I heard it . Here ! " He pulled her to the tumbled bed and forced her to sit down , while he bent over her , his face chalky and twitching . " Sit down . You must prepare yourself for a shock . There 's been a murder in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore  --  at Number 55- " " Murder . Do you understand ? " Madame 's head jerked like a frightened bird . " The Duchesse de Praslin was found brutally murdered not two hours ago . " " The Duchesse . " Henriette stared from one to the other , and though her lips repeated their words her eyes remained wide and incredulous . " But that ca n't be . I 'm to see her at two o'clock to-day . " " She 's dead , I tell you . " The old woman 's fingers were like claws on Henriette 's arm . " Do n't sit there as if you were still asleep . All Paris will know it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Hush , madame ! Give her a moment to come to her senses . Let me tell her what I can . " Albert took her cold hands and rubbed them between his own , which were only a shade less chill . He was speaking to her while Madame continued to babble and jerk hysterically . " I 'd been working all night on that paper for the Academie , " he was saying . " I could n't sleep , so when it grew light I went out to walk . I often do early in the morning to calm my nerves . That was about five , I think . I was going along the Rue du FaubourgSaint-Honore , and it seemed to me there was an unusual stir for that hour . People ran past me , and when I came in sight of Num/ber 55 I saw a crowd collected . I thought the family were away at Melun  --  " " They were till last night , " Henriette whispered . " I could n't get near the entrance . The police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here next , " Madame was whimpering . " They 'll he pounding on my doors , saying , Open in the name of the law , ' and all because I took you in . " Albert planted himself between Madame and Henriette and tried to go on . " I asked a workman what had happened , and he told me the Duchesse had been murdered . Hacked to pieces , he said . Mon Dieu , I did n't believe him till I saw they were drawing the blinds of her apartments . They were beginning to call the news in the streets as I came away . I got here as fast as I could . I did n't even stop to tell Marie . I could only think of breaking the news to you before you heard it being shouted under your windows . " Henriette could not answer him . Numbness was creeping over her as she sat in her nightgown on the edge of the bed , staring blankly before her . Madame Le Maire 's words of fright and distressfell on her unheeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all , " she kept insisting . " This is the thanks I get for sheltering you . Oh , that this should happen to me ! " " But , madame "  --  Albert tried to calm her  --  " nothing has happened to you . Henriette has nothing to do with this frightful crime . She was here sleeping quietly till we waked her . I only came to prepare her for the shock . There 's no reason she should he dragged in . " " But she will be . You 'll see . She ca n't be kept out . I know how it will be , and she must n't stay in my house another hour . " " Please , madame ! You must n't give way like this . We must find out more of this . I 'll go for a paper  --  " " And she 'll go with you . Take her away before they come . " " But I must be here if I 'm sent for . " Henriette gatheredp281strength to speak at last in a toneless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need me now , more than ever before . " " You 'll not be here for the police to find . " The dry , difficult sobs of old age were shaking Madame Le Maire 's body under the shawl . Albert looked at her and hesitated ; then he touched Henriette 's shoulder . " You 'd better come with me , " he said . " It will be easier for you over there with Marie . If they send for you , though I ca n't see why they should , we 'll leave word where you 've gone . I 'll wait downstairs till you 're ready . " Somehow he got Madame Le Maire out of the room . She waited till their footsteps sounded faintly on the floor below . Then she got to her feet and began to dress . Mechanically she reached for the clothes she had left folded on a chair . Without feeling , her fingers found brush and comb and sponge ; felt for buttons and loops and lacings . Only when she fastened the bodice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it come over her that she had last put it on in expectation of the Duc 's visit . The household was already astir as she descended the stairs , her cold hands clinging to the railing , grateful for the solid familiarityof the wood . Albert and Pierre were waiting by the door . The old man had forgotten his coat . He stood there anxious and unshaved in his coarse blue blouse . " Do n't let any harm come to her , " she heard him caution AlbertRemey . " She 's not been like her old self all summer . " Then , as he let them out , he touched her arm , and his old eyes searched her face . " Maybe it will all turn out a mistake , " he whispered encouragingly . " These papers are nothing but lies . That 's why I never read them . Mind the steps there . I spilled a jug of milk just now . But no matter , it will give Madame something else to scold about . " It was half past six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet and deserted . But just around the corner they could hear the cries of the news venders . Even in the distance there wasp282a queer exultant , almost animal note in those lifted voices , something more than mere shrillness . " Blood is in their voices , " she thought , and for a moment she turned faint and had to lean heavily on Albert . " I 'll get a carriage , " he said . She shook her head . He must not spend so much money , and she realized that she had forgotten to bring her own purse . They walked on without speaking , but they kept close together . She took comfort from the sense of his kind , bodily nearness . Every one they passed held a paper or was in the act of buying one . Workmen were reading the black-lettered sheets so avidly that she and her escort often had to turn aside to escape collision . They alone were empty-handed . But the words of the news vendersfollowed like hounds at their heels : " Murder in the Rue du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catastrophe fatale . . . Praslin . Murder . " A man thrust one of the news sheets rudely into her face beforeAlbert could push him away . But those bold black letters could not be thrust aside . " Only a few more blocks , " Albert encouraged her . " Do n't listen to them , Henriette , and forget what Madame said . She lost her senses for the moment , that was all . " " Oh , but , Albert , she 's right ! I am somehow part of this -- this  --  " She could not bring herself to say the dreadful word that was echoing all about them . " Do n't ask me how I know , but I do . "  |p283ON  THE THE DE LA CITE the Palais de Justice was a somber pile of stone against an August sunset . Shreds of cloud , softly brilliant as flamingo feathers , drifted across the sky and were reflected in the river flowing between buildings . But the walls of the Conciergerie caught no hint of that brightness . It stood gray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the swift procession of years and the men and women it had sheltered in the name of the law . There Marie Antoinette had spent her last night on earth . Danton , Madame Roland , Robespierre  --  these and countless others had passed through the gate on the Quai de l'Horloge and into the Salle des Gardes . And now on the 18th of August in the year 1847 another pair of feet had been led across the worn stones of the courtyard ; another pair of eyes stared through one of the barred windows . Henriette had made no protest when the police had come for her at eight o'clock that morning . She had been calmer than the Itemeys then . She had even tried to reassure them as she had left between two guards . " Do n't cry , Marie , " she had begged . " It 's only a formality . I am wanted for questioning , they say . Please , Albert , do n't try to reasonwith them . You only make it more difficult for us both . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she had known better than to believe the words she had spoken . Now it was evening , and still she sat alone in the small bare room where they had brought her , the latest comer to the Conciergerie she had so often passed . She had not guessed what it would mean to be there . The sight of a cage is only frightening to the bird that has once been caught . But the sound of a key turning in the door that had just closed upon her had brought a sharp and sudden sense of reality . It was as if a trap had beenp284sprung  --  a trap that caught but did not kill . In that moment she had known overwhelming panic , such as she had not experienced since early childhood . A wild impulse to beat on that door , to scream in futile protest , had overtaken her . She had needed all her powers of control to make no protest as the footsteps retreated along the corridor . Twice during the day they had brought her food , and a matron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . They asked her if she would care to buy a bottle of wine to drink with dejeuner . But she had declined the privilege . She could not bring herself to explain that she had brought no money ; she could not venture a question as to why she was confined there . All she knew she had gleaned from one of those early news sheets . It had been under her feet that morning as she reached Albert 's door . She had picked it up and carried it with her later . They had not taken it from her , and now in the failing light she pored over the meager account . For perhaps the hundredth time she forced her aching eyes to read the words , forced her mind to believe the reality behind those ink-smudged symbols . This concerned some one she had known , whose home she had shared for the last six years . The phrases were so familiar now she knew them by heart . Still she could not realize them in relation to the Duchesse , to the plump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy and spasms of affection she had known so intimately . The noble Duchesse de Praslin is no more . . . . She breathed her last this morning some time between half past four and five in the family residence in the Rue du Fauhourg-Saint-Honore , Number 55 ... Little is known as yet of the brutal attack on the person of this wealthy and benevolent member of the nobility , wife of Charles Laure Hugo Theobold , Duc de Choiseul-Praslin , mother of nine children , only daughter of the Marechal Sebastiani .... At the early hour mentioned , people on the street and within the residence were shocked to hear violent screams of agony and the repeated ringing of a bell from the Duchesse 's bedroom . According to report three serv/ants  --  her maid , Madame Leclerc ; Madame Merville , the porter 's wife ; and Auguste Charpentier , the Due 's valet de chambre  --  rushed to the scene . Strange to read those names in cold black type when she could summon up the persons behind the letters so clearly ; when she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . These three tried the doors but found them locked . When they finally effected an entrance all was in the utmost confusion and the unfortunate woman already expiring in pools of her own blood . The Duchesse had evidently put up a fierce struggle against the blows of her assassin , who is believed to have escaped through the garden and into the Champs Elysees . According to the Due de Praslin , who .. . Here the paper had been torn at the very place she most longed to read . In vain she tried to piece out the explanation which must have followed . But she could not go beyond the impossible fact that she had not yet been able to make herself believe . Murder did not happen to those we have known intimately in the past , to those we are expecting to meet today or tomorrow . Sensational horror or crime can not touch us . Other people 's lives , perhaps , may be crossed by such violence , but not our own . We arc somehowsecure against that . Twilight settled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical windows and deepened in the narrow rooms . But for once darkness was not kind . More vividly than ever she saw the pale , full face of the Duchesse with every shifting , unpredictable mood reflected upon it . She saw , too , those luxurious rooms which had been turned into a shambles . She could not rid her mind of pictures those printed words had conjuredup before her eyes . She saw the disordered bed and rich hangings spattered with red stains ; chairs and tables overturned ; books and bric-a-brac scattered on the carpet with its gay garlands where sinister poolsp286were drying in dark patches . On the secretary between the windowswhere the Duchesse had so often given vent to her grievances , her quill hurrying faster than the bird that had once borne it , unfinished letters might still be lying in confusion . There might even now be one beginning : " To Whom it may concern : I hereby recommend Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy for those excellent qualities of mind and character which she has maintainedduring her years of service as governess in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been penned in those last six hours of the Duchesse 's life . But Henriette knew that she would never receive it now . It would never be presented to Madame Le Maire or another possible employer . Some one was unlocking the door . A lamp was being screwed into an iron socket . Once more the woman in charge was speakingher name . She set a bundle down on the cot and went through the contents carefully . Henriette recognized her own Paisley shawl and other articles of , her clothing . " Your friends brought them a little while ago , " she was told . " They wanted to see you , but you 're allowed no visitors yet . " Marie Remey must have been to the Rue du Harlay and have collected these few belongings . No one else would have thought of such personal needs , and Henriette blessed her for that . This simple gesture was all that one woman could offer to another . Yet it comforted Henriette a little to handle the familiar lengths of shawl , to set her brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most grateful to Marie for the handkerchiefs . They smelled faintly of vervain from the gardens at Melun . A dried leaf of it still lay between the folded squares . Strange to smell that fragrance in this place , even stranger to be able to smell at all , to recognize a scent when one felt this numbing paralysis of the senses . The Conciergerie cot was less hard than hers had been last night in the Needle 's Eye ; the room was less stifling . Yet she lay , staring wide-eyed into the darkness , listening to the quietp287all about her , a quiet so intense that as the hours passed she longed for anything to break the unnatural stillness . It was a relief to hear the hours strike or a footstep echo in courtyard or corridor . Here , in the very heart of Paris , it was as if life were suspended . Whether they slept or lay , wakeful as she , those within these walls were no longer part of the city and its activity . Their lives , their loves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely out of their keeping . The idea obsessed her as she waited for morning and the first thin graying at the window . She forced herself to take the bread and coffee that was brought her . From the guard who came to take away the tray she begged for permission to read a morning paper , but he could not grant that favor . He was a pleasant , talkative fellow , easily persuaded to tell her what he could of the murder . The papers were full of it , he said . No one talked of anything else . Every cafe and shop and street corner buzzed with each new detail of horror that leaked out . That first rumor about an assassin having broken into the Duchesse 's bedroom was all nonsense . It appeared now that the Duc de Praslin himself was undersuspicion , though it seemed unthinkable that such a thing could be  --  a husband guilty of an inhuman attack upon his own wife . The poor woman had bled to death from over a score of wounds and had been brutally beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely whisper the protest that interruptedhis recital . " Thar 's not possible . Monsieur le Duc could never  --  You do n't know what you 're saying . " But he merely shrugged expressively . He was only repeating what all Paris was saying . At first even the police had refused to believe it . But they had had to believe what was all too plain beforetheir eyes . When they had followed the advice of the Duc 's own valet and searched his rooms they had found plenty of evidence against him . Oh , yes , it looked very bad indeed for Monsieur le Duc . He was under guard and they were taking nochances of his escape . No matter if he was a Peer of France , answerableonly to the King , people meant to see that he paid for murder like any other criminal . " And what  --  do they say of me ? " Henriette heard herself askingfaintly . He answered with another shrug , eyeing her curiously across the tray with its thick pottery cup and plate . Her name had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that she and Monsieur le Duc had been  --  well , what men and women often were to one another . There had been rumors before about the part she had played in that family . They said there had been no love lost between the Duchesse and the children 's governess ; they hinted much worse things than that . That was why the police had brought her to the Conciergerie for questioning . They meant to get to the bottom of what lay behind so ghastly a murder . She would be answering them herself soon . Then she would know more than he could tell her . No , he could not say how long she must stay in the Conciergerie . But she should be thankful she was here . It would not be safe for her to walk the streets of Paris just now.  |p289It  was not a public courtroom into which they led Henriette , but a smaller , private one where perhaps a dozen men had gathered . Their faces were so many blank disks to her as she took her place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shock of the guard 's words that morning had left her numb , with the same incredulous despair she had felt when Albert Remey had aroused her from sleep with the fatal news . She had lost the power to think , much less feel . It surprised her to find that she could still walk erectly and without trembling , that she could seat herself calmly on the chair that had been placed for her near the Judge 's desk . Monsieur Broussais , who was to conduct the interrogation , barely looked up as she entered . His hands were busy with numerouspapers , and he appeared engrossed in conversation withp289another man , le Procureur du Rol . They talked together in low tones , while the rest regarded her with undisguised curiosity and made whispered comments among themselves . Flies buzzed maddeningly ; one lighted in her hair and though she brushed it away again and again , it always returned . So absorbed was she in trying to rid herself of it that she hardly realized the hearing had begun until she was being addressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to some one else , to bear no relationship to her personally . So began the first examination of Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes , aged thirty-five years , spinster , governess , native of Paris , resident of the pensionconducted by Madame Le Maire at Number 9 , Rue du Harlay , in the district Marais . The first questions put to her were perfunctory : How long had she been in the employ of the Praslin family ? What salary had she received ? What had been the nature of her duties ? She repliedin a steady voice that surprised . But the next question came in a different tone . Monsieur Broussais leaned across the desk and fixed her with his enigmatical , deep-set eyes . " We have already learned that you were guilty of grave wrong in this household : that you did not show the deceased Duchesse proper regard , that you sought to alienate the affections of her husband and children . Is this true ? " The other occupants of the room also leaned forward in their places . Henriette felt the slight rustle of excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time had come to give more than a perfunctory answer . All eyes were upon her as they waited for words from her lips . She summoned them to her as one might call upon a well trained pack of hounds to perform their duty . " No , monsieur . " She spoke clearly and without hesitation . " That was never so . When I first entered the Praslin household , matters were already on a very bad footing . There had been governessesbefore me , but they left because they found it impossible to get on with Madame la Duchesse . Always there was trouble over the children and their education . "  | " And what was the nature of this trouble you mention ? " " The Duc wished to direct that himself , and it was understood from the first that I should be accountable only to Monsieur . I was to live and dine with the children in separate quarters . I told the Duc that this was a difficult position for me and great responsibility , and some adjustments were made . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there when I took up my duties , and naturally she resented my presence . From the first she prejudiced the Duchesse against me . Madame continued to interfere with the children 's affairs and the results were unfortunate . Monsieur was greatly displeased and expressed himself so to Madame . So we came to live more and more apart , the children and I , though I never consciously tried to win them away from their mother . The disagreements between the Duc and Duchesse continued , and it was beyond my power to change that . Perhaps it was wrong for me to have accepted so extraordinary a position , but I never tried to hurt Madame . If I did sometimes answer her with annoyance it was only because I had been myself unjustly hurt . " " And what , " the questioning voice was going on , " were the causes of this dissension you speak of between the Duc and the Duchesse ? " " On the Duchesse 's part it seemed to be a desire to dominate the children , and above all her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of resistance , though he was less violent by nature . " " Your presence in the intimate life of this family seems to have particularly inspired the Duchesse 's jealousy . Was there good cause ? " " I can not deny that at times Madame la Duchesse showed marked jealousy towards me , jealousy which had no grounds whatsoever . Then at other times the situation between us was less strained . When she was in good humor and treated me graciously I could forget her unjust accusations . There I was ,  |p291messieurs  , without money or friends . I had to try my best to keep the position though often it took all my patience . Then , too , Monsieur le Duc offered me a pension if I had the courage  --  those were his very words  --  to complete the education of his older daughters , and I had promised , difficult though that might be . " The matter of the pension had to he investigated : Had it been part of the original agreement when she took up her duties ? Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conversationconcerning it ? A long pause followed while Monsieur Broussaismade notes on the papers before him . Then he cleared his throat in preparation for his next sally . In the tense quiet of the room that had an ominous sound . " Is it not true , " he asked , " that the Duchesse , particularly of late , believed that intimate relations existed between yourself and her husband ? " So , the old scandal had cropped up again . Henrietta had known it must , and she was prepared to face it . " Never , monsieur , no , never that ! " She made the denial swiftly , then she spoke more slowly , weighing her words with care , realizingas she did the significance of the question . " The Duchesse knew that such relations could not have existed . She did not accuseme of them . She may have said so to others , but not to me . Certain libelous articles did appear in the newspapers . Two years ago , while I was staying with the children in Corsica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave at once because of it . But the Marechal Sebastiani , the Duchesse 's own father , persuadedme to stay . For some time the Duchesse did treat me harshly . But then she grew less cold , and all through this past winter she was gracious to me . I had even hoped we might come to a better understanding when two months or so ago I was overwhelmed to be told that my presence was no longer desired . " Monsieur Broussais 's expression remained impassive during this recital . When she stopped speaking he reached among the papers before him and selected one which he handed to her . It was writ/ten on a sheet of the Duchesse 's own note paper , and though it bore no date or salutation she recognized it as one written to her , beginning : If it is forbidden to go to rest without being reconciled to one 's neighbor , it seems to me that a New Year is a still more urgent rea. son for putting aside all disagreements and forgetting all complaints . So , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already been to Madame Le Maire 's and rifled the box where she kept her private possessions . " This letter , " she explained , " was written by the Duchesse to me a year ago . It came with a bracelet as a New Year 's gift . I remember it very well because it marked a change in her former coldness . She took me to the theater with the young ladies sometimes , and even discussed the subject of their future marriage . She asked me to use my influence with the Duc about his views on this matter , but I had to refuse that . I could not intrude in anything so personal . " When the letter had been returned to Monsieur Broussais 's portfolio , more questions followed . These concerned her dismissal , the date of her leaving the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore , and whether she had continued to see the Duc . There were others , as to how and where she had passed the night of August 17th , how she had first heard of yesterday 's tragedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's when the police agents came for her . It was the next question that brought her to her feet , her eyes wide and panic-stricken as they turned upon her questioner . " Have you learned of the grave charges against Monsieur le Duc ? Do you know that he is believed to have murdered his wife ? " " No , no , messieurs ! " She found herself searching the faces one by one in frantic appeal . " Tell me it 's only some unfounded rumor . I can not believe he could have done it . He could never bear to see the slightest suffering of one of his children . Please tell me these changes are not  --  what you say ! "  |p293But  no one reassured her ; the eyes continued to watch the effect of the news upon her . She knew from their silence that this was more than some wild rumor . It could not be true , and yet if it should be . . . Somehow she must make them understand the part she had unwittingly played in all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It came over her now in a lightning flash of conviction that she alone held the key to this horror . That letter of recommendation had been written in the Duchesse 's blood . Her knees were shaking ; her hands clasping and unclasping themselves . She heard herself pleading , babbling broken , incoherentphrases , as Madame Le Maire had done yesterday . " Please , messieurs , listen to me . He could never have done this dreadful thing . . . but if he should have had any part in it  --  Mon Dieu , then it is I who am the guilty one because I asked too much . . . . I , who so loved the children , adored them .... I was a coward not to accept my fate . I wrote them . You can see the letters for yourselves . I told them how unhappy I was , that I no longer cared to live . I was afraid to face the future . Oh , I was wrong , wrong ! I ought not to have let them know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even happy in that bare , small room . I ought to have told them to forget me and think only of their mother . But I was not brave enough for that . I was driven to despair , and I wanted to die . I had a bottle of laudanum , and I drank it . Unfortunately I was called hack to life , and life was bitter to me . After six years of such happiness among those children I loved and who loved me , the emptiness seemed unbearable . I can see it all now , and now it is too late . He must have gone to her demanding that fatal letter of recommendation the Duchesse had promised me . She must have refused him , and then . . . There , you see , I am guilty . Write it down there in your records  --  guilty . " Monsieur Broussais 's voice cut into her recital , cool and precise and edged with irony . " It seems hardly possible , mademoiselle , that such a display of emotion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be applied to children . Was it to these children only that you addressed the despairing letters you mentioned ? " " Yes , monsieur . " She raised her eyes directly to his . " All sentimentscan be lofty , as you say . Ca n't you understand that ? But I wo n't deny that when the Duc was so good to me , always so generousand thoughtful , there did not mingle with the love I felt for the children , a genuine affection for their father . " She caught her breath sharply , and went on , her voice rising in the stillness of the room . " But I never brought sin into that home  --  adultery then , since that is in your minds . I could never have held those children close if I had been guilty of that . They were like my own children , though perhaps I am wrong to use those words for this whole little band . Still , that is how it was . Ca n't you understand that it is possible to love honestly ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bombardment . Now that she had rallied from the first shock , her wits returned , and she was able to meet and turn aside his deft , sarcastic implications . She met the challengewith squared shoulders and a swift , sure fire of words that kept all eyes upon her ; that even brought a grudging hint of admiration into the voice of her examiner . She knew he waited like a cat to pounce on any remark that might be misinterpreted , to twist anything that could be turned as evidence against her . She knew how much depended on her answers . It was not enough to speak the truth and that alone . One must be clever as well as honest . Outside , the noon sun stood high over the roofs of Paris , over the metallic glitter of the Seine parting its watery coil above the Ile de la Cite , about the Palais de Justice and the Conciergerie . Inside the crowded room the air grew heavy , and a merciless glare filled the unshaded windows . Men 's faces gleamed with heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow and spectacles . Henriette 's handkerchief was a limp ball in her hands . She pushed the damp hair from her forehead and accepteda sip of water from a glass an attendant offered . Shep295must not let her mind wander for an instant . No matter how the flies buzzed or how her eyes and head ached from trying to catch the full meaning of the words addressed to her , she must keep on the alert . All her life she had loved words and kindled to them , but now she was in their power . They shot to and fro , like shuttles weaving the threads of some invisible pattern . If only one could know the pattern one wove in that hot room while minutes ticked away into hours ! Ruthlessly as a surgeon dissecting a patient , Monsieur Broussais'squestions probed to the very core of that life in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore , in Melun , and iii Corsica . The quick blade of his irony delicately laid bare the tissues wrapping cause and motive . He must trap her into some unguarded admission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as powerful as her questioners . She was speaking the truth . She had nothing to hide from him . At last Monsieur Broussais pushed aside his papers with an impatientgesture . It was plain that he tired of these constant allusions to the Praslin children and the controversies between them and their mother . Here was a crime of unspeakable brutality , the most significant socially and politically he had ever been given to investigate , and this poised , attractive woman sitting before him refused to allow herself to play into his hands . She dared to confoundhim with answers as crisp as his questions , answers in which he could not find the admissions of guilt he had expected to uncover without much difficulty . " Come , mademoiselle . " He spoke brusquely . " We must keep to the point . We are here to consider , not these suspicions betweenyourself and the deceased Duchesse , not the jealousy which brought about your immediate dismissal , or this letter of recommendation , the importance of which you have stressed . What concerns us now is a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any household  --  discord between man and wife . You were supported by the husband against the wife . Can you deny that this was so ? "  | " In certain matters , true . But how could I know how far it was carried , or how serious the trouble between them actually had become ? As to what is evidently in your mind , monsieur , I can only repeat that the Duc de Praslin never showed other feelings for me than friendship and esteem . Again I must protest , and I will not mince words  --  he was never my lover . " The sincerity of her denial was apparent . But Monsieur Broussaiswas not through . " Yet in the brief interval since you left that household , " he pressed her , " you have penned letters which you yourself admit you did wrong to write , and you allowed the Duc to pay you visits , three at least . Yesterday you were to have gone to that house to see the Duchesse about this letter , and yesterday she met a violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ca n't explain them , to myself or to you . I can only say what I have said before . I can only repeat that nothing wrong ever passed between myself and Monsieur le Due , and there was never any future wrong intended . " She hesitated for a moment , gathering words to answer a questionthat had not yet been put to her . " I tell you the children 's interests came first with me always . If the Duchesse had died a natural death , and if the Duc had then asked me to marry him , I should not have consented for their sakes to such a misalliance . And I had no idea of any other wrong . If Monsieur le Duc had loved me , there is no telling  --  I might have sacrificed my life and reputation for him . But as it was I never tried to come between him and his wife . I would not have harmed a hair of her head . I 'm telling you the truth , monsieur , and you must believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice that can convince you of that ? " Her ability at anticipating questions and turning her answers into direct appeal had scored her several points . The group of listeners could not help being swayed by her eloquence and lack of pretense . Monsieur Broussais was himself amazed . He had never been called upon to examine such a witness . But he couldp297not afford to be lost in admiration . The interview was not over . Once more he brought out a handful of papers for her to identify . " You have here before you , " he interposed , " certain letters . Were they written by you ? " " Yes , monsieur . I sent them to the older Praslin daughters a month or so ago . " " One of them contains an unfinished sentence , whose full meaning is not clear : You do not speak of your father . I hope that he is well and continues to keep his courage . It seems to me I should be less unhappy if I were sure to suffer  --  ' Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart sank . She had regretted that letter ever since it had been dispatched . She had written it impulsively to Louise on a day when it had seemed impossible to go on alone in the Rue du Harlay . Read aloud like this , apart from its context , the sentence certainly took on more significance than she had intendedat the time . " I must have meant to end the sentence with the word alone , ' " she told them , " or perhaps with the phrase for all of you . ' I cannotremember why I broke off . Perhaps I decided it would be better not to speak to the young girls of their father . " Monsieur Broussais nodded as he took charge of the letters once more . " You did right , " he commented dryly , " quite right , because it contained expressions of feeling which were not fit for young girls to share . " A quick protest rose to her lips , but the hearing was over . For the present at least Monsieur Broussais and his associates were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to copy down the notes he had made of those questions and her answers . " God alone knows , " she thought as she passed by that desk on her way from the room , " who will read these words that have gone out of my keeping . " Outside those doors , the spirit that had carried her through the ordeal left her completely . She felt limp and exhausted , as shakenp298and spent as if she were an old woman . The store of energy that she had called to her aid for the last hour was gone . She was grateful for the guard 's arm as she mounted once more to her room in the Conciergerie . She could not swallow the meal they brought her . She shook her head when they gave her permission to walk in the courtyard for half an hour . So they left her , and she sat on through the interminableafternoon , trying to recall each word that had been spoken at the hearing . Why had she not thought of such and such an answer ? Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private papers of hers , of the Duc and of the Duchesse , might not Monsieur Broussais and the police be poring over at that very moment ? They all believed the Duc was guilty , and that she was his accomplice in crime . Though she had not slept in the Faubourg-Saint-Honore that night , they all believed that she had had a part in this horror . " It 's not possible , " she repeated as she had repeated that morning . " It 's not possible . Monsieur le Duc could never have done such a terrible thing . " She said the words over and over , and yet all the while she was unconvinced . She wanted to believe in that first rumor of the mysterious assassin who had escaped into the garden , but she could not . She was remembering the strained expression of his face as she had seen it last in Madame Le Maire 's poorly lighted hall . She remembered how the stair rail had quivered under his grip . She thought of those large , powerful hands that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another or on Berthe 's yellow hair . And now they were stained with blood . The sudden recollection of a spring night came to her , the night when he and Louise had surprised her by their return from the country . He had poured out a glass of port , and some of the wine had spilled . She felt faint now , remembering the red drops on his white skin and how fastidiously he had wiped them away . Six years ago last May , that had been .. . " It 's not possible , " she kept repeating stubbornly.  |p299Yet  she knew too well the truth her lips denied . The daily venom of the Duchesse 's jealousy had corroded his self-control . It was as if an oak tree that had defied storms and woodsmen had fallen at last under the incessant hammerings of a woodpecker . A key clicked in the lock , and the door was opened . She roused at the sound of a familiar voice speaking her name , scarcely daringto believe in the reality of her visitor . Yet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as they had not shaken her through the long , dark hours of the night or duringthe hearing that morning . She was no longer alone , and that knowledge overwhelmed her . " But how did you come here ? " she asked when she grew calmer . " Albert and Marie Remey tried , but they were turned away ; and I thought I had no other friends in Paris . " He kept her hands in his and spoke reassuringly . " I am your friend , Mademoiselle Deluzy , Mademoiselle Desportes  --  itdoes not matter which name you go by , and I am also your spiritual adviser . They can not deny you the comfort of your church , no matter what the charges are against you . " " Oh , Monsieur Monod , I hardly know yet what the charges are . This terrible crime , and they say he has clone it , and only night before last he came , with the children  --  " She struggled against her tears at the memory . " Tell me what you will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall repeat your confidences . I know what they are saying of your part in this  --  " " You do n't believe that I am guilty ? " " No . " He shook his head . " But even if I were in doubt I should have come to you here . You would have needed me even more . I was in the country when I read the news . Those first reports made no mention of your name , but I knew you were a member of that household , and I guessed the shock would be too much for you . I did not know you had left . I did not know till I reached Paris this morning that they had taken you into custody . " She managed to tell him all she could of her dismissal , of thep300Duc 's last visit , and the letter which she insisted must have been the cause of the tragedy . " Yes , " he agreed , " it may be as you say . Goliath went down before a pebble from David 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the final blow . But you must not dwell on that . You have made mistakes ; so have we all , though some of us are less ready to admit them . " " Monsieur Monod "  --  she faced him through her tears as she poured out the story of those six difficult years , while light faded in the courtyard of the Conciergerie  --  " I ought to have told you all this before  --  before it was too late . I ought to have asked your advice . But I was so sure of myself . I believed I could manage my own life . Mud might spatter and spoil other skirts , but not mine . Somehow I believed no harm could come to me because I meant no harm to others . I was defiant and proud because I felt too sure of myself . " " You are not the first to make that mistake , " he answered gravely . " We all believe our lives are our own till we find we cannotseparate them from other lives . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , because I committed no actual wrong , that I was above reproach . But now  --  it 's terrible to think that she met this violent death , and that I , too , am being held to account for it . I could never like her . I could never respect her . Even now I ca n't bring myself to forget her faults and her stupidities , but I can never forget that she might be alive today , poor soul , if I had not insisted on what I believed was my right . Nothing I can do or say can ever change that . She is dead , and God knows what will become of him and of the children . " Monsieur Monod did not try to ease her with trite phrases of comfort . He did not offer to pray for her as other ministers of the Gospel might have done . " You are too honest to make excuses for yourself , " he said . " You are suffering far more than you deserve ; for , the greater one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for suffering . But remember that the greatest wisdom is to find out one 's folly.  |p301Kee|p  your courage , mademoiselle . You 'll need it , whether Monsieurle Duc is able to clear himself of these charges or not . " She begged for news of the Duc , but he could tell her little more than she already knew  --  that he had been taken into custodyby the police . Each newspaper edition published a more sensationalstory than the last . Monsieur Monod told her what he could , without attempting to keep other aspects of the case from her . The whole country was aroused , and feeling grew more and more intense . It involved the King and the whole structure of his court . " Out there , " he told her , " the people believe that the Duc is guilty , and they want to see him tried like any other criminal . But , being a nobleman , he is answerable only to his superiors in rank  --  the King and the House of Peers . If he should be freed of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discrimination ; and if he is convicted , that will bring great censure on the court circle . You know the discontent that is in the very air . " Yes , she knew , though she had not thought of that before . Her personal problems had absorbed her completely . But now she sensed what lay behind his words . The King was far from popular , the public ready to pounce on anything that savored of corruptionin court circles . This might be the chance the country had been waiting for , to assert its power . It was ironical , she thought , that she should figure in a case involving the House of Peers and the King himself  --  she , who had championed the cause of a new Republic , who had always been so outspoken in her denunciation of the House of Orleans . " I know the feeling is against me , too , " she said . " One of the guards told me so this morning . He said I was safer here in the Conciergerie than at large in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soften his answer . " There are wild rumors going about , " he admitted . " Unfortunatelyyour name is coupled with the Due 's . You know the publicis more easily swayed by persons than by principles . It 's simplerto fasten blame to a man or a woman than to a system ofp302government . Of course no one can guess how this feeling will be from hour to hour . I 've seen public opinion shift like a wind and put out the very fire it lighted . " " Or the fire can spread , monsieur , till there 's no longer any chance to put it out . " " Well , " he told her , " the King is hurrying back to Paris . It 's not a simple case of murder that he has to deal with . For that reason it is important that you have a good lawyer at once . You have a right to legal advice , and I shall see that you have the best we can find . " But she shook her head . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can answer their questions for myself . " " But you have no knowledge of the law , my child , and you must have help in giving your testimony . Some ignorant blunder on your part , some sudden impulse , might do you great harm . " " I 'll take the risk . I 'll tell them anything they want to know as I did today . " " You must n't be hasty in this . If it 's the matter of money that makes you hesitate , you 're not to give that a thought . I have means enough to help you , and I happen to have influential friends in the law . You shall have the best possible counsel . " " You 're more than kind to me , " she broke in . " I do n't know why you should be when I have no claim upon you . I ask no reason for your generosity , I am only very grateful . But a lawyer would confuse me . The truth is all I have to offer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " He smiled at her in spite of his disapproval . " Have it your way then , " he said . There was a knock at the door , and a voice warned them that Monsieur Monod had overstayed his allotted time . " I have n't prayed with you , my child , " he said as he rose , " but I think you are capable of making your own prayers . Mine you will have , and those of my household . "  | " It 's good to know that . And you 'll come again ? " She clung-to him anxiously . " As often as they will let me . Remember , you are not alone . You have friends . The Remeys are waiting for me now . Have you any messages for them ? " " Only my love and thanks . And perhaps if you were to talk with my grandfather  --  " She told him the address and hurried on . " He has never thought well of me . He opposed my taking this place . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my only relative , and at such a time he might be willing to come to my aid . " " I 'll see what I can do . I 'll go to him with your message at once . Is there anything else on your mind ? " " If you could bring me any word of the Praslin children it would relieve me , especially of the younger ones . And , yes , there is one more thing . Tell Albert and Marie to remind Madame Le Maire of the basket on my window sill . It would be a pity to have the fruit spoil , and the melon ought to be ripe by now . "  |p304DURING  THAT WEEK of August 18 to 24 , 1847 , all France rocked with horrified impatience at each day 's revelation in the Praslin murder case . Not only in Paris and Marseilles , but in Brussels , Amsterdam , and Berlin , in London and Manchester , men and women discussed it in shocked voices , avid for more details . They read the doctors ' reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score of wounds , almost any one of which had been deep enough to prove fatal . They pored over diagrams of Number 55 , Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore , following those gruesome ink marks which represented the bloody tracks the victim had left on furniture , floor , and walls during the savage struggle ; the red prints of her fingers groping desperately to find the bell cords . They devoured the testimony of the servants who had answered her summons ; that testimony which was united in its accounts of domestic discord and in its insistence that the lately dismissed governess had been the chief cause of quarrels between Monsieur and Madame . They read of the valet , Charpentier , and his shrewd advice to the police not to- earch for the murderer outside the house but to look into his master 's quarters . They marveled at the reiterated denials of the Due , confronted as he was by such irrefutable evidence as a blood-stained dressing gown and shirt ; the charred remains of burned letters and papers in his fireplace , and those unexplained scratches and bites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his flimsy story of an assassin in the face of such indubitable proof of his own guilt ? How could any man , let alone the head of one of the noblest families in France , do such a deed of violence and brutality , people asked one another on either side of the Channel . The opinion everywhere was unanimous in branding him as the most inhuman criminal of his day . From statesmen to shopkeepers andp305street venders , it was agreed that no further evidence was needed to condemn him , and no death sentence could be cruel enough for such a man . And this Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes , the exgovernesswhose name and accomplishments figured so prominentlyin every version of the crime  --  what of her ? She , too , was being torn.to shreds in a variety of languages . Always a woman in the case , they agreed , and what a woman she must be ! No man hacked a faithful wife , the mother of his nine children , to death unless some other woman had driven him to madness . She must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could that be possible for a governess in her middle thirties , and not beautiful either according to the papers ? But one could never explain such things . The Duc had visited her with several of the children only a few hours before the murder . She had admitted that much and more in a secret hearing . The police had taken charge of her and her belongings . It was well they had done so at once , for with feeling running so high against her there was no telling what a mob might do . As early as Friday August loth , the London Times was already commenting on the importance of the case in an editorial : The Paris papers of Wednesday , received by our ordinary express , contain no political news of any importance . " Even had it been otherwise , " says one of our correspondents , " public attention is so painfully absorbed by the murder of the Duchesse de Praslin that nothing short of an insurrection would attract notice . " On Saturday August 21st , Paris papers announced that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under close guard from his residence to the prison of the Luxembourg . There he was said to be suffering from a mysterious illness . His indispositionwas considered serious enough to warrant the attention of his personal physician , Dr. Louis , and to delay his examination by Chancellor Pasquier , President of the House of Peers . Alarm/ing rumors began to circulate later that day as to the prisoner 's condition , which was said to be growing serious . Meanwhile the Court of Peers gathered to present the arraignment . No one who reported on the events of that week could actually be sure what new turn the case might take from hour to hour . Informationreceived on good authority might be worthless by the time it had been set in type . The most conservative papers read like lurid gossip sheets , and even important figures in literary circlesleft their desks to crowd the benches at the first public hearings , setting down their impressions of those concerned in 1'aflaire Praslin . Victor Hugo , writing a day-to-day account in his " Choses Vues , " commented on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 22nd : At the present moment one can perceive , in Mademoiselle Deluzy 's window in Madame Le Maire 's house , Rue du Harlay , the melon , the bouquet and the basket of fruit which the Duc brought from the country the very evening before the murder . The Duc is seriously ill . People say he is poisoned . After an account of her position in the family and excerpts from her first questioning , he continued : Mademoiselle Deluzy is still in the Conciergerie . She walks about in the courtyard each day for two hours . Sometimes she wears a nankeendress , sometimes a striped silk gown . She knows that many eyes are fixed upon her at the windows . Those who watch her say she strikes attitudes . Another writer in Gazette des Tribunaux added a more detailedaccount of her during that period of daily exercise : The description of Mademoiselle Deluzy given in is not altogethercorrect . She is dressed simply , but is not wanting in distinctionor grace . Her figure has lost the suppleness of early youth , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligent ex/pression . Her complexion is pale and shows fatigue ; her hair , of rich brown , is arranged with taste . She wore yesterday a nankeen dress , a black scarf , and a straw bonnet with lilac ruching . She walked slowly , her arms crossed on her breast , and her head bent . " So the days passed for Henriette without transition , but with one shock after another in the avalanche of calamity that had overtaken her . Her second examination took place , this one beforeChancellor Pasquier . Of this proces verbal Victor Hugo made mention , quoting one of his colleagues as saying : You will see Mademoiselle Deluzy . She is a rare woman . Her lettersare masterpieces of wit and style . Her response to questioning is admirable . . . . If you had heard her you would have been astounded . No one has more grace , more tact , or more intelligence . If she wishes to write some day for us , we will give her , par Dieu , the Montyon Prize . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once wicked and charming . Henriette was better prepared for her second ordeal , though the sleeplessness from which she suffered and the strain of waiting had told upon her . She needed no mirror to confirm her feeling that youth had left her forever . The elasticity of hope was gone out of her step and out of her heart . But she met the questions with the same unflinching directness she had shown before . Her answers came without hesitation , each word as direct and well chosen as the Chancellor 's own . For hours the verbal tournament went on . " You did not try then , as you should have tried in every way possible , to bring these children closer to their mother ? " " I tried sometimes , at first , but it was useless ; and though the Duchesse did not approve of many of Monsieur Praslin 's ideas on their education , she seemed willing to leave that to him . She never gave me any orders about their welfare , except in matters that concerned their dress , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was seldom , she would talk to me ofp308matters above the heads of children . They grew restless and preferred to be alone with me , and this annoyed their mother . " " Did you not realize , " Chancellor Pasquier persisted , " that such isolation from her children must be painful to a mother  --  that it would cause difficulties between herself and the Duc de Praslin ? " " Quite the contrary , monsieur . I believe on my soul and honor that Madame de Praslin was far more preoccupied with her feelings for her husband than about her children , whom she sent away when their father was present in order to be alone with him . She was constantly trying to divert his attention from them to herself . I have seen her leave the room abruptly if Monsieur le Duc played with or fondled one of the children . She was alwaysshowing her jealousy and irritation at such marks of affection . The children realized this and , with the innocent malice of their age , only redoubled their demonstrations to their father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but it was not always in my power to prevent the bad effect of it . As time went on and my love for my pupils grew greater , I could not keep entirelyimpartial to all this daily friction . I could not give back to Madame de Praslin those she had willfully , or at least imprudently , allowed to slip away from her . " Her explanation left the Chancellor unconvinced . There was open rebuke in his next words and in the manner of their delivery . " From all you say , it is evident that you are trying to throw the entire blame upon Madame de Praslin . It is hardly your place to be the judge in such matters , and your words lead me to doubt that you did all it was your duty to do in meeting so deplorable a situation between this mother and her children . It appears from the testimony of others and from documents in our possession that you exercised almost absolute power over these young people . We are forced to believe that you have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances as you ought to have done . " Once more Henriette gathered all her forces to reply .  | " I would not for the world be lacking in respect for Madame de Praslin 's memory , " she began . " But you ask the truth of me , and I am bound to tell the whole truth to the best of my ability . I do not criticize Madame 's heart or her intentions , but her characteris another matter . Her temperament was difficult , very irritableand inflexible , which made her incapable of handling so many children of various ages , minds , and dispositions . She had not the faculty of winning the heart and confidence of youth . She would take undue offense over some small matter where indulgencewas needed and then pass over some important issue that called for firmness . These were the reasons why Monsieur le Due insisted upon her not meddling in the children 's education . Unfortunately the Due 's pleasure in his daughters ' company angeredthe Duchesse . We all suffered in consequence . " " And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame de Praslin 's hands passed into yours ; the affection of the children for their mother also became concentrated in you . Suppose you did not actually exert yourself to bring this about , you must have seen how matters were and known that it was your duty to prevent , rather than aggravate the situation . We must therefore hold you responsible to a large degree for the fatal results which have followed . " Chancellor Pasquier had shifted from question to direct accusation , but Henriette had her defense ready . " I never said , I will turn the affections of these children for their mother to myself . ' But I loved them and I devoted my whole self to them . Their pleasures were my pleasures ; their pain was my pain . Six years I watched over them by day and by night . They loved me with all the enthusiasm of their years , and I returnedtheir love . I was without family ties , without friends , and all my feelings were bound up in my duties , which were so congenialand pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : Could not any mother have won her children to her if she had wished to do so ? " This unfortunate ability for turning questions upon her ques/tioners made her a spirited witness . Like Monsieur Broussais , the Chancellor found her more than his match in repartee . But she never went too far in her efforts to justify herself . She clung tenaciouslyto her points and , though at times her crispness verged on arrogance , she maintained a respectful dignity of bearing and speech that was above reproach . Again she was questioned about her last meeting with the Duc , and again she gave a full recital of that evening visit to Madame Le Maire 's with its fatal emphasis on the letter of recommendation . Only once did she falter , when it came to repeating his last words to her : " I play a sorry part in all this . . . Good night till tomorrow . " " And Monsieur de Praslin said nothing that might have led you to think he was roused to go to such lengths with the Duch-esse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unusual vehemence . " By all that I hold sacred in life ! I do not know if I am allowed to mention here certain facts , known to me alone , which proved that the violence was not always on Monsieur le Due 's side . I often heard the Duchesse threaten to take her own life , and twice to my knowledge she attempted to do so . Once at Melun she tried to stab herself , and the Duc in disarming her wounded his hand . Again at Dieppe , after a quarrel , she rushed out of the house , threatening to throw herself into the sea . But with those unpredictableand changing characteristics of which I have told you , she was found later by Monsieur le Duc in a shop , apparently quite calm again and making some purchases . " She had hoped to arouse sympathy for the Duc , but it was evidentfrom the Chancellor 's comment that he considered this only another proof of the desperate extremity of the Duchesse . The hearing proceeded much as the first one had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and routine of the household . Where Monsieur Broussais had questioned her specifically as to improper relations with the Due , Chancellor Pasquier seemed more inclined to believe her protestations that no such liaison could have existed . He seemed determined to prove her guilty ofp311a far less obvious crime . His interest now centered upon her undueinfluence over the Praslin children and the direct results of this upon their parents . It was a clever move on his part to shift the emphasis in order to prove her guilty of a deliberate campaignto estrange the children from their mother . Her own admissionscould be used against her in this way . If she tried to justify her hold over her young pupils by explaining their mother'sjealousy and indifference , she would be accused of laying the blame upon a dead woman who could not be called upon to clear herself . If she did not account for her sympathy toward the childrenand their father , she would appear more than ever what the public believed her to be  --  a scheming serpent whose wiles were behind that tragedy of August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could only cling , as she had told the ReverendMonsieur Monod she would cling , to the truth . That was her only weapon of defense against these officials in their red robes who sorted and weighed her acts and words as deliberately as if they were actually balancing them on mental scales . " No , " she reiterated wearily as the session dragged on and on . " I did not try to take them from their mother . One can not steal affections , messieurs ; they are given freely or not at all . And you must believe me when I tell you I am not maligning the Duchesse . She was the same to others , often unjust and fault-finding , but she had kind impulses too . One moment she could cut to the quick , and in the next be generous and pleasant . Often in the space of an hour she would be like that , perhaps blaming me because she thought I exerted too great influence over her family and then presently coming to beg me to use it to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or make me some handsomepresent . One never knew what to expect . " But this seemed to be taken by her questioners as further proof of the Duchesse 's goodness . More questions followed . Henriette 's head throbbed with them . The room with all those watching faces swam in a haze before her , and the scratching of pens on paper went on without pause.  | " In every answer you make , you insinuate some wrong against Madame de Praslin , " the voice rebuked again . Tears of protest and weariness rose to her eyes . She wiped them away and forced herself to answer in a voice that shook from the long strain . " I wish sincerely that I need not say what I do . She is dead , messieurs . If I could bring her back to life by giving mine , even by suffering those horrible tortures , I would do so . But I can do nothing now . I knew every turn of her mind in these six years , her every change of mood . No one knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to generosity , from disdain to kindness . I have not said a word that was disrespectful or untrue . I do not defend myself . I have only tried to make things clear . " The second examination of Mademoiselle Henriette DeluzyDesporteswas over . They led her back to her room in the Conciergerie . By that evening of the 23rd of August the rumors concerning the Duc de Praslin 's condition had grown alarming , though Henriettewas ignorant of them . Across the river in the prison of the Luxembourg it was plain to the doctors that they could do nothing to combat the poison that was steadily gaining possession of their patient . The Duc de Praslin was dying . Only his superb strength had kept him alive with ' all that arsenic in his system . They ag Need among themselves that he must have taken enough to kill half a dozen men , judging by the tortures he suffered . A smaller dose would have proved fatal within a few hours , but the amount he had managed to consume some time during the day he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all but defeated his own end . For nature had reacted to the poison instead of being immediately overcome by it . He had borne his sufferings at first with stoical indifference , but as the agony increased his half-suppressed groans were terrible to hear . These and the convulsions that shook him at inter/vals were , however , the only signs he gave to those gathered about his bed . He had already been questioned , first by the police on the morning of the crime and later by Chancellor Pasquier . The latterhad urged him to make full confession , but he had persisted in his denials . From first to last he had clung to the same story , insisting that he had been awakened by shrieks and had hurried to his wife 's bedroom . In the horror and confusion that ensued he could give no clear account of himself and his actions . The bloodstainson his robe and shirt must have come there when he had taken the dying Duchesse in his arms ; the pistol found near her was his , he had caught it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not account for the blood and strands of hair upon it . Why had he tried to wash away the bloodstains ? To that question he answeredthat he had done so because he did not wish to frighten his children by such a sight . He made no effort to explain the burning papers in his fireplace . A match must have been thrown there . How could he remember what he had done at such a time , and under such stress ? He begged them to spare him further questions till tomorrow . He felt too weak to answer . But the Chancellor had persisted . It would not take much of Monsieur le Duc 's breath to reply briefly " Yes " or " No " to the charges . What about those marks on his hands ? The scratches , he explained , he had suffered in the country when he had helped to pack the trunks and boxes for their journey . And the bites ? They were not bites . The doctors said otherwise . Well , he could not answer for the doctors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are always speaking of your weakness , Monsieur de Praslin . No wonder you feel so when you think of your children and of this horrible crime you have committed . " " Crime ! " The Duc had roused himself a little . " I have committedno crime . As to the children , they are always in my thoughts . "  |p314He  had buried his head in his hands and remained silent for some time . " Were you urged to this act by evil counsel ? " His questioner hoped to draw him out in this way , but the prisoner could not be forced into any mention of Mademoiselle Deluzy . His stubborn denials of all part in the murder continued . " I have had no counsel . People do not counsel such things . " " You are being devoured by remorse . Would it not ease your conscience if you told the truth ? " Again the evasive plea : " My strength fails me today . " " Do you dare to affirm that you have not committed this crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was repeated . " Your silence gives the answer for you , " the Chancellor continued . " You are guilty . Is n't that so ? " " You have come here with a conviction of my guilt . Nothing I might say could change your opinion . " " You can do so if you will give me a reason to believe otherwise . Without further explanations we can only hold you re-sponsible . " " I tell you I am not able to go on . It is beyond my strength . " " Monsieur de Praslin , you are in a state of torture ; and as I said to you just now , a simple answer is all I ask of you . Are you or are you not responsible for this murder ? Answer yes or no . " " I can not reply to such a question . " Once more the Duc took refuge in silence which he steadily maintained to the last . The doctors marveled at his vitality . They did what they could to relieve his pangs , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to lapse into unconsciousness while there was still a chance to bring him to a confession of his guilt . On Tuesday afternoon August 24th , at five o'clock , the Duc de Praslin drew his last breath in the prison of the Luxembourg , just seven days after his arrest . His death and burial were at/tended with secrecy , and the news kept from the public as long as possible . Of this event Victor Hugo noted : It would appear that Monsieur de Praslin was a very well made man . At the post-mortem the doctors were much struck . One exclaimed , " What a beautiful corpse ! " He was a fine athlete , Dr. Louis tells me . . . . The tomb in which they laid him bears a leaden plate , on which is the number ro54 . A number after his death , as convicts have in life , is the only epitaph of the Duc de Choiseul-Praslin . But others were less restrained in their comment . Once pub lished , the news spread rapidly , and public opinion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , from gendarmes to King Louis-Philippe himself , suffered severe censure . The murder had been shocking enough without allowing the obvious culprit to escape from the consequences . Suicide was too easy a way out for such a criminal . The law should have exactedthe extreme penalty for this deed , and instead it had been cheated of its victim . Everywhere people grew hot with indignationagainst a government that had condoned such evasion of justice . It did not matter to readers of newspapers whether that dose of arsenic had been deliberately smuggled in to the Duc by his superiors , or if he had foreseen his own extremity and prepared for it . One fact , they all agreed upon  --  this prisoner had not met the fate of an ordinary criminal . If he had not been a close friend of the King , and a Peer of France , he would be alive to face the grave charges against him . What was the use now of all the detailed reports of the examiners ? of the carefully tabulated evidence prepared by the police ? of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need now to fill columns of fine type with the pitiful , passionate contents of the Duchesse 's journal , or to print those letters the Duc had not burned , anguished appeals for affection that would never be gratified ; jealous tirades against " MademoiselleD . " Murdered and murderer were both mute . They could not be called back to life to answer the questions of highp316officials in red robes . The Praslin murder case had become a dead issue as far as the law was concerned . It was only a skeletonnow . But skeletons in royal closets are not easily dismissed , as King Louis-Philippe was to discover all too soon . Across the Channel a farsighted editor in the London Times wrote prophetically of l'affaire Praslin : Nothing could be more contrary to the interests of the Governmentthan the scandal arising from such an act at the present moment . It is more likely to exercise an unfavorable influence on their fortunes than a systematic sapping and mining of the public liberties for twenty years . The Government had but one chance , to hand the Duc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We foresee that this most injudicious withdrawal of a culprit from justice will be turned against the French Government . We do not mean to attribute any share to the leading people of Paris in this most horrible and revolting crime . But it would be vain to deny that a profound demoralization does at this moment exist in the very heart of French society . We will not pursue this subject of the suicide of the Duc de Praslin . If the French Government have connived at it , they will soon find cause to repent their error . It is not probable that we have yet come to the end of this disastrous tale . Henriette may have read these very words , for during those last days of August she was allowed the privilege of newspapers . She still remained in the Conciergerie , still took her exercise in the courtyard each day , and still waited for the law to decide what to do with her . It was a vexing problem . The most careful examinationshad revealed nothing that could be used as tangible evidenceagainst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiners during those hours of questioning . Yet the whole country believed her to be a party to the crime . Next to the Duc de Praslin she was most hated , and now that he was dead , she alone remained , the bird in their hands . From being an obscure governess without friends and in search of work , she had become in the course of a single week the most despised and talked-of figure in France.  |p317PARIS  ROOFS WERE SLEEK with November rains : The river flowedin sluggish gray under its bridges , and the tall old buildings on either bank were as drab as the blowing smoke from their chimneypots . The gardens of the Luxembourg and the Tuileries dripped in duns and browns , their benches clamp and deserted , even by beggars and sparrows , those most indefatigable city tramps . Only splashing horses and the vehicles they drew moved on the wet streets , or sodden figures under the domes of umbrellas . In an upper room of a house near the intersection of the Rues de Monceau and Teheran , Henriette stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The room was not much larger than the Needle 's Eye , though its furnishing showed far more taste and comfort . A table had been drawn close to the window , and a variety of objects littered it  --  books , sewing materials , a pot of marigolds , a box of pastel crayons , besides writing materialsand a portfolio of papers . But her hands were not occupied with any of these ; they lay idle and listless in her lap . A maid tapped at the door and , in response to a " Come in , " opened it a crack to deliver her message . " Madame Monod 's compliments , and would Mademoiselle Desportescare to join Monsieur and Madame in the salon for a cup of chocolate ? " But Henriette shook her head . " My thanks to Madame and Monsieur but my headache still prevents my joining them , and I will not be down for dinner . " After the maid had left , Henriette sat without moving while the rain kept up its monotonous drumming in the gutters outside . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for refusing the kindness of friends . She was under enough obliga/tion to the Reverend Frederic Monod and his wife without al , - pearing indifferent to their efforts to distract her from the lethargywhich she could not shake off . They had been goodness itself , those two , insisting that she make her home with them as long as she cared to stay in Paris . That September day when she had been given her discharge by the law they had made her welcome , and she had been glad to take refuge in this shelter they offered . There had been no other choice except to go to Albert and Marie , for she could not return to Madame Le Maire 's establishment , and after the notoriety of the murder no hotel or pension would have dared to take her in . Her grandfather had made no effort to aid her , and she learned from those who had tried to enlist his sympathies that the old man 's health and finances were in a precarious state . He lived near Passy , completely under the domination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her only relative for help in the difficulties she now faced . It was fortunate that Monsieur Nlonod had taken her and her cause to heart . He was a powerful and prosperous ally as well as his two brothers , one a wealthy merchant of Havre . The other , Adolphe , was also an influential Protestant divine who had lately been called to preach at the Oratoire in Paris . The brothers Monod not only believed in her innocence and admired the couragewith which she had met her ordeal , but they were determined to rally their congregations to her side . Her Protestant faith had been against her in that Catholic household , and the murder now had taken on religious as well as political significance . In a Catholiccountry like France it was inevitable that this should be so . The Monods knew that even among the minority which their church represented prejudice against her would be difficult to overcome . All they could do for her now was to give her their support and hope that they could influence others of their faith to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to expect it to be changed overnight . That would take months , even years to alter . Everywhere people branded Mademoiselle Deluzy-Desportes  |p319as  the real instigator of the Praslin murder . Since her release she had become the target of a more intense and bitter hatred because she was the only living link in that triangle of domestic tragedy . The press and public still believed her guilty and would have relished nothing more than to see her go to the guillotine . In her discharge they saw only another example of legal incompetence and governmental procrastination . Already the Duchesse de Praslin wore a martyr 's halo and was mourned as the victim of a husband 's infatuation for a clever and scheming rival . Everywhere wives and mothers denounced this " MademoiselleD. " and praised the dead Duchesse as a paragon of virtue , whose only fault had been to love her husband and children too well . " Let the women of France lay hands on this governess , " was the hue and cry in streets and shops and homes , " and then she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine speeches of hers to the lawyers and Chancellor would be wasted on us . Let her suffer as she made another suffer . She has no right to go free ! " It was essential that her whereabouts be kept secret ; so only her few friends knew her hiding place . She must not go out alone for fear of recognition and the consequences that might follow . She must use an assumed name if she ventured beyond that loyal household . Although the subject of future plans had been carefullyavoided so far , it was plain to all that when she was able to resume her old occupation of teaching she could not do so in France , where the ghost of scandal would always follow her from post to post . She would never be free of it . A spying glance , a whispered word , an awkward question , and that shadow would fall upon her . She knew how it would be , though as yet she dared not speak of that to her generous hosts . No , her head did not ache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left her ; she was held fast in the grip of inertia . Once she had had courage to live and feel , once she had even had courageenough to die . But now life or death seemed immaterial . She continued to breathe ; to wake and sleep ; to eat and drinkp320what was set before her ; to go through the mechanical gesturesof the living  --  that was all . Whatever was put into her hands to do , she did with her old skill and efficiency . She helped about the house  --  sewing , dusting , copying sermons and letters for Monsieur Monod , hearing his children 's lessons . She was glad to make herself useful so long as nothing more was asked of her . She could even read those newspaper accounts of the Praslin case without flinching . They seemed not to concern her now , though the faces of the Duc and the Duchesse , of the old Marechal , and each of the children were as clear as if they still moved about her . Even now , nearly three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tragedy were being raked over and sifted by the press . She could scarcely pick up a paper without finding some reference to herself and the investigation , and alreadylegends were springing up . Workmen making repairs on the Due 's apartments in the chateau had discovered a fancy dress costume stuffed behind a loose piece of molding , a scarlet devil 's suit the Duc had worn to a masquerade . The Duchesse 's maid had then recalled a dream her mistress had had earlier that summer . Madame had told her of it and of the frightening apparition of a devil all in red who had stood threateningly above her bed . She had screamed , and it had vanished . They had given the matterno further thought . But now it took on a sinister significance . Surely so macabre a premonition was more than a mere dream of the Duchesse . There were stories from Corsica of a gypsy warning that mentioned danger and blood , and as a bride Fanny Scbastiani had dared to wear pearls , defying the superstition that each pearl will mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read these fantastic stories unmoved as she read the dead woman 's frenzied and pitiful outpourings in her published letters and journal : Do not be astonished , my dear Theobold , at my fear of being alone with you .

It is impossible to believe that this is only a friendly intimacy between a man of your age and a young woman in her position . What an example to give to young persons ! When I reached here I had hoped for peace , but the illusion did not last long . The carriage steps had not been let down before I saw in your icy , discontented air , in the constrained expression of the children 's faces , in those green eyes which appeared behind your shoulder , that I was about to be subjected to the most painful humiliation . . . .

Return , return to her !  --  My pillow is wet with bitter tears . Strange to read the broken phrases , the denunciations of herself , the demands that would never be gratified now . Strange to know that the hand that had penned them would never be warm with love or hate again . Light was fading fast in the upper room . The words of the long columns of newspaper print grew dim before her eyes . Yet still she must read the words  --  her own repliesto the questions of the judges ; the Due 's last testimony ; and letter upon letter of the Duchesse . She could feel nothing as she read those wild and bitter words , though behind the type she could see clearly that familiar blue note paper with its family crest and the heavy , flowing pen strokes she had come to know and dread in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firstp323note that had been addressed to her . She remembered how shocked she had been by the discarded one from which Rayiiald'sscissors had snipped a heart . She had felt guilty then to have such intimate revelations put into her hands , and now the whole world was reading them . A knock sounded on the door . The rap was loud , but it came from lower down than usual , just the height of a child 's reach . She put the papers away and turned to greet ten-year-old TheodoreMonod . He carried a birdcage in one hand . " I 've brought my goldfinch to keep you company , " he announced , setting the cage carefully on the table . " I 'm sorry your head aches . " After she had thanked him for the loan of his bird , the boy stayed on , eyeing her in timid fascination . " You should put cologne on your forehead , " he told her . " I can get you some of Mamma 's . I know where she keeps it . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of headache colognewould help . How did you get on at school today ? " Even in her state of apathy it was natural for her to take an interest in the child , who was only too eager to respond . He and his older sisters had already fallen under her spell , though they had received strict orders not to disturb their guest . " I did all my arithmetic right , " he assured her , " and the Professorread my composition about the shells to the class , the one you helped me with . But I failed in my Latin . The plural case is so hard . I had to stay after the rest and write Exeunt omnes a hundred times . Do you know what that means , Mademoiselle Desportes ? " " They all go out , ' " she translated . Then she turned from him with a catch of her breath . " Yes , I know what that means . " Presently Monsieur Monod himself appeared , and Theodore was sent downstairs . " I thought I should find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . " You draw our young people like flies to a honey/pot , but you must n't let them impose upon you . My wife and I are sorry to hear you have another of these headaches . We had hoped we could count upon you to help us tonight . " " Tonight ? " " You 've not forgotten we are giving a small reception ? " She had forgotten , and the mention of it only made her shake her head and beg leave to stay upstairs . " No one is coming who might annoy you , " Monsieur Monod persisted , studying her with anxious intentness in the failing light . " A few friends besides my brother Adolphe and his family . My niece has promised to sing , and we thought perhaps you might be willing to accompany her on the piano . " " Oh , Monsieur Monod , do not ask me to move among people yet . It 's too much for me .

You were so brave during your ordeal , you ca n't afford to lose your courage now that 's over . " " I spent all I had , " she told him . " I 've no more courage in me . " " You underestimate yourself . I 've come to ask you as a favor to me , to join us and our guests this evening . " " I can hardly refuse when you put it so .

" " Oh , but , Monsieur Monod , you do n't know  --  " " I know you will do your best . " He smiled encouragingly . " Remember , it 's no time to retreat when the battle 's won . " At the door , he turned and spoke again . " Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy does not concern us now . She belongs to the past . But I have great hopes for a certain MademoiselleDesportes . " When he had gone she sat a long time in the gathering darknessbefore she forced herself to light a lamp and lay out her clothes for the evening . She dreaded going to the wardrobe and bureau drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memories clung to every fold and mocked her as she shook them out . Her linen still smelled of vervain from the chateau gardens . There was not a dress she owned which did not recall some remark of Louise or Berthe or Raynald , or the approvingglances of their father . In the little white jewelry box with the carnelian-studded lid , lay the bracelet and blue enamel pin which had been peace offerings from the Duchesse . The cameo brooch of Raynald 's choosing was there , too , with all its poignant memories . It had been mounted according to his own ideas , with his name and the date of his birthday engraved on the gold back . She turned it over and stared at those letters in the lamplight : " Raynald , June 18 , 1847 . " But even that failed to melt the ice at her heart . She moved in numbness to the wardrobe and selected her best dress , the moss-green moire with bands of russet and small bronze buttons that matched the slippers she took from their tissue-paper wrappings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had borrowed them to dance the polka up and down the old schoolroom ! How gayly she had danced ! And now , where were those quick , light feet ? Were all those Praslin daughters dressed in mourning ? Were the clear eyes red with weeping shocked , incredulous tears , or cloudedp326with dumb bewilderment ? What of Berthe , with her father 's ways and hair and smile ? What of Raynald , sensitive and loving , who had shared his own birthday with Mademoiselle ? She would never know how they fared . She would never see them again . Better so , perhaps , since by now their minds and hearts must be poisoned against her . No , she could not have met disillusionment in those young eyes that had always turned to her in love and trust . " Exeunt omnnes , " she thought bitterly as she made her preparations . It was half past nine when she entered the large , old-fashioned salon where some eighteen or twenty guests had already gathered . She slipped in unobtrusively through the adjoining study and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew slightly . As she stood there , speaking of she scarcely knew what , she caught sight of herself in a long mirror and marveled that she should look much as she had looked when she had last worn the green moire six months before . She appeared somewhat paler and thinner , and her face had fallen into graver lines . But these were the only outward changes she could find . Her hair still curled and shone on either side of its parting . Her brow was as smooth and unlined , her mouth wide and full-lipped as ever . How , she wondered , could it be that she bore no visible signs of inner blight ? People were being kind  --  far too kind , she decided after half an hour had passed . Their determined efforts to be casual embarrassedher more than all the curious scrutiny she had been subjected to in the Conciergerie . Those she knew greeted her cordially , but pointedly refrained from addressing her by name . They talked rapidly of the most inconsequential matters , and carefully avoided looking her full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feigned indifference . She had often tried in the same fashion to disregard the sightless eye or scarred cheek of another . Never , she vowed to herself in the crowded room , would she be guilty of such obvious kindness again . Better to peer curi/ously at crippled infirmity or disfigured flesh ; better the frank stare , than the polite , surreptitious glance . It was a relief to turn her attention to the piano and the sheets of music spread in readiness on the rack . Fortunately the airs were familiar , since Madame Monod had lately prevailed upon her to play many of them for herself and her daughters . The young singer had a sweet , fresh voice ; and her manners were childlike and modest . She had no pretensions to soar to the heights of the Swedish nightingale , who had taken Europe by storm . She knew she was no future Jenny Lind , so she contented herself with pleasing her family and their friends and keeping on pitch without spectacular tremolos and trills . Henriette took her place on the bench grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the room which the singer faced . As her eyes followed the notes and her fingers moved over the keys , she forgot for a little the constraint that her presence had brought to that roomful of people . She had planned to make her escape after the musical interlude , but escape from the crowded room was not easy . More people had arrived . She recognized one group , standing a little apart , as the guests from America . There were five of them , two women and three men , less stylishly dressed and assured of mannerthan their countrymen one saw in shops and on the boulevards . She knew she ought to join them and try to put them at their ease . But somehow , tonight , she did not feel equal to making an effort for these strangers . She felt even a sudden resentment that they should be there at all . Why had n't they stayed on the side of the Atlantic where they belonged ? Why must they come here in their queer-looking clothes , butchering the English language , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not look so much like a flock of uneasy , disappointed birds of a feather , huddled on some alien bough . And then , without warning , one of them left the bough . He hurriedtowards her , his face beaming with frank , pleased curiosity , his eyes looking straight into her own with a sudden light ofp328recognition . She tried to turn away , but even if there had been room to pass the groups of people , something about the eagerness in those eyes held her where she stood . She felt annoyed and furious and yet at the same time compelled to notice this young American who advanced upon her . She did not encourage him by so much as the flicker of an eyelash , but he still hurried on , a small , inconspicuous figure charged with excitement that fairly bristled under a poorly fitted coat the color of snuff . Now he was speaking at her elbow in a voice that surprised her by not being the nasal , high-pitched twang she had come to associate with Yankee visitors . " You are Mademoiselle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I should have known you anywhere , even without the bonnet with the lilac trimmings . " Earlier that evening she had felt embarrassed by the tactful restraint of her acquaintances ; now she was experiencing the blunt frankness of an unknown young man . He could be hardly more than some student , to judge from his looks . Still he was old enough to know better . One expected a certain amount of crudity from Americans , but such blundering as this was too much to overlook . " I see , " she responded crisply , " that you read the newspapers . " Her shoulders lifted in a slight shrug , and there was an ironic edge to her words . But her disapproval made no impression on him . He continued to fix her intently with his candid blue eyes , oblivious to every one else in the room . " Why , yes , I do read the newspapers , " he admitted , and a sudden , disarming smile transformed the plainness of his face . " I can read French better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid . The papers were full of you . I read every word , but they never told me all I wanted to know . You see , ever since I landed in France  --  " This was preposterous ! She would really have to snub him , even if he was an invited guest . She frowned and cut short the eager rush of words on his lips.  | " It 's quite unnecessary to explain that you 've heard of nothing but the Praslin case since you came . Probably you know far more than I do about it . " " I know that you have been brave and steadfast under great misfortune ; that you met their attacks with honesty and eloquence . Is it any wonder then that you have  --  " " Please ! " Again she cut him short . " Please do n't say anything more . And now , if you will excuse me , I was just on the point of leaving . " But he did not stand aside politely . He actually came a step nearer to block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do that now ! " he went on , unaware that he had been dismissed . " I was going on to tell you that , ever since I landed , you have been so much on my mind . " " On your mind , monsieur  --  " He nodded an emphatic assent . " I confess "  --  she forestalled another rush of impetuous words , and went on quickly  --  " I confess I see no reason why I should have been there . Have n't you Americans troubles enough of your own without crossing the sea to hunt clown more ? " " Yes , " he agreed simply , again ignoring her bitterness , " we have troubles of our own , as you say , but yours happen to be very important to me . That 's why , when I saw you in the Conciergeriecourtyard , and now tonight  --  " " You could n't resist satisfying your curiosity still further ! You thought a few questions more or less would n't matter after all those I 've had flung at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an icicle , but she felt her cheeks flush in angry betrayal . " I 'm sorry , " he said , " if I have made you think that . I hoped when I heard you speak such fluent English that it would be easy to make myself clear . But that 's difficult sometimes in any language . My trade is in words , you see ; so that 's why I know they ca n't always be depended upon to say what we feel . " " You are a writer then ? "  |p330She  might have guessed there was some such reason behind his persistence . A young newspaper man from America  --  probablyhe had been sending back reports of the investigation . Perhapshe meant to write the story of her life with embellishments of his own . The sooner she put a stop to that , the better . " Only in a way , " he was explaining . " I do write articles sometimes when I have time between my sermons . " " Sermons ? " It was her turn to stare curiously at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minister ! But , no , you ca n't be ! " " But I am , " he insisted with another smile . " It 's not necessary to look like an Old Testament prophet to preach the Gospel , is it ? " " No , " she was forced to admit . " I suppose there must be all kinds , only I never happened to meet a minister like you . " " And I have never met any one like you  --  so there we are . " " You really preach sermons from a pulpit , " she repeated , eyeinghim half amused , half admiring . " It 's hard to believe that . You look too young . " " I 'm twenty-five , " he told her , " and I 've been preaching off and on for ten years . " " Oh , so they let children preach in America ? " " I was fifteen , " he explained patiently , " halfway through college . My father is a minister , too , so I suppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again with that swift smile  --  " I 'll never forget that first experience . It was a little country church where students were often sent to preach . " " And what was the subject of your sermon ? " " On Christ throwing out the money changers from the Tent , pie . I thought when I saw my congregation of farmers and their families that perhaps I had n't made a very choice . But they did n't seem to mind about that , or my not having a robe . You see , " he went on confidentially , " my family were very poor , and I usually wore one of my brothers ' coats , and they are all much bigger than I. A cut-down roundabout hardly made me look im/pressive when I mounted to that pulpit . It did n't seem so difficult at the time , but that first sermon did age me . I know , because I had to pay full railway fare on the trip back , and they had let me ride for half-fare before ! " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh in spite of herself . " Yes , " he said , studying her with even more pleased intentness than before , " I thought you would look like that when you smiled . " She made no reply , and he did not seam to expect one . Other people jostled at their elbows , or brushed by them with billowing skirts , but they stood quiet together as if they had made an island for themselves in some hurrying human stream . Then it caught them up and whirled them apart once more . Marie and Albert Remey seized upon her , and presently she must go to help Madame Monod serve refreshments in the adjoiningroom . For the next hour Henriette had no chance to talk with the American , though she saw him now and again , watching her with that air of intimate expectancy which was so strangely disturbing . She wished that he would leave , as others were doing , but he lingered on , a small , determined figure on the fringes of animated groups of men and women . His quietness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little physical presenceto boast of . Perhaps the fact that he did not gesticulate when he spoke , gave him a kind of dignity . Yet it was more than just that , she decided . At close range one might be deceived by plain features , a too naive eagerness of manner , or by the queer cut of foreign clothes . But at a distance he assumed his real proportions , as a certain mountain peak that has been indistinguishable among others will rise when viewed in true perspective . The artist in her recognized this , and the woman in her felt his integrity . He stood out in that gathering , not only because of a racial difference , but because of some inner simplicity and sureness of purpose which possessed him so completely that he was himself unaware of the power.  | " No wonder , " she thought , smiling at the memory of his confession , " no wonder that first congregation of his did not dare to laugh . " She felt a touch of remorse , remembering how hostile she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enthusiasm with effrontery . She need not have behaved so rudely , trying to snap his head off simply because her own nerves were on edge . But then , she was not used to the headlong exuberanceof visitors from America who could be almost indecently personal at first meeting . The company was thinning out rapidly . She would be able to slip upstairs to her room without much notice now . But there he was coming towards her again with that confident , bright look . She was sure he would outstay all the guests , for he seemed completely unaware of time despite the gold watch chain that flapped on his vest . " Now we can talk , " he began almost before he had reached her side . " I was growing impatient . You were so busy . Now tell me " But first you must tell me something , monsieur  --  your name . " " Field , " he said , " and you 'll find my first one simple  --  Henry . Then Martyn in the middle . " " Henri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle  --  Field . " " They never made it sound like that at home , " he told her admiringly . " They would call you Henrietta over there . " " Field , " she thought . " I might have known it would be a short , plain name like that . But it fits him  --  simple and unpretentious , and yet full of living importance . " ) " I like your name , Monsieur Field , " she heard herself saying . " It seems right for you . " " It 's one of the few things my father thinks his sons should be proud of , " he told her . " We 're a fair-sized family , " he added . " I have two sisters and six brothers . " " Whose clothes you sometimes wear , " she prompted.  | " Not since I left Williams College . " He laughed . " Yes , that 's the penalty of being the youngest and smallest son . I 'll tell you how our family goes : David Dudley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan Edwards , Stephen Johnson , Cyrus West , Henry Martyn , and Mary Elizabeth . " He had to pause for breath . " Do n't tell me any more names , " she begged . " Henri Martyn is all I can remember tonight . " " I shall be writing them about you , " he went on , " by the next mail packet . " " Oh , but , please ! " she began , but she could not finish because the two Monod brothers joined them . " I 'm glad you brought me that letter of introduction . " Adolphe Monod spoke cordially to their guest . " We should have missed having you with us tonight . " " I would not have missed tonight for all the rest of my stay put together , and I 've been in England and Scotland , too . " " And you 're off to Brussels in the morning , I hear ? " " Yes , and then on to Germany and Austria , and perhaps as far as St. Petersburg if my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these last five years . " " What globe-trotters you Americans seem to be ! " Frederic Monod smiled wonderingly and shook his head . " He must have been born with an itching foot . Do n't you think so , Henriette ? " " He must indeed , " she agreed . " I have often wondered , when I 've seen tourists tramping about and looking so tired and uncomfortable , what ever made them come so far . " " You should be able to answer that question for her , Monsieur Field . " " Well , it 's this way , I think . " He grew suddenly serious and pushed back a straight brown lock of hair that had fallen into his eyes . " For most of us one book is not enough to satisfy our minds , and so one life is not enough either . We want to experiencemore than can ever be crowded into seventy or even eighty years . I am too greedy , perhaps , but I want to catch at the mean/ing of different lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on under the thatched roofs of cottages and behind the walls of palaces and hotels . I want to walk in old ruins and in new cities . I want to watch people everywhere , whether I can understand the words they are saying or not . It is too much to ask , perhaps , but I want to get behind the faces of men and women and feel what they are feeling . " He broke off with a sigh . " Do you understand what I mean ? " " Yes . " Henriette spoke before either of the men had a chance to answer . " You 've made me understand . " " Some day you must put that all in a book , for those who travel and those who stay at home . " Frederic Monod spoke with approval . " Yes , Monsieur Field , " his brother Adolphe joined in . " You have a true passion for travel , so let us hope you will go far , in more ways than one . " As their visitor turned to leave with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I wish you a fortunate journey , " she said , " and a safe return . Good night . " After he had gone the brothers Monod spoke of him to Henriette . A most extraordinary young man , even for an American , they all decided . Perhaps a trifle too eager , but with a good heart and high intelligence . The letters he had presented from friends across the Atlantic all praised his mind and character . They said he was considered a brilliant scholar , a particularly fine student of Greek and Hebrew and philosophy , and that he showed unusualpromise in the ministry . His family were of the best Puritanstock , although he certainly had nothing of Puritan coldness and constraint in his make-up . Yes , when one became used to his naive frankness of manner , one realized that he had a fine mind and largeness of sympathy , even a roughhewn sort of charm  --  did n't Henriette agree ? At all events she had been most kind to devote herself to putting him at his ease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoped it had not been too tiring.  |p335As  she climbed the stairs to her room she remembered the unabashedadmiration in the eyes of the little American . She had aroused his ardor and idealism , and such was the power of his belief that her sense of futility lifted a little . All these last weeks she had tried to hide behind a wall of her own making , to shut herself away where nothing could ever hurt her again as she had been hurt . Others had respected her wall ; even the considerate Monods had only rapped there discreetly . But he had known better . Walls were something to be scaled , and he had leaped over hers in a single bound.  |p336The  CROWDING POLITICAL EVENTS of that winter of 1847 and 1848Hcnriette attached little significance to the Monod reception ; yet it marked a distinct transition in her life . She began to feel once more and to suffer as her numbed senses thawed . Shock and disaster had till then overwhelmed her almost completely ; but as strength returns to paralyzed limbs with sharp pin-pricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether she woke or slept , she was beset by memories the more bitter because they had once been sweet . Everywhere they assailed her , whether she handled personal possessionsor turned some street corner that brought her face to face with the past . Without warning , ghosts would rise up from the very pavement to confound her . A fiddler 's tune , a shop window , a playbill announcing the great Rachel 's coming performances , the smell of roasting apples , the fragrance of a man 's cigar , children with eyes shining above parcel-filled arms , children singing carols , Notre Dame seen dimly through falling snow  --  she was at the mercy of them all . Some chance remark of Theodore Monod or his sisters could make her eyes film suddenly or her lips stiffen as the screws of memory tightened at her heart . A man 's tall figure swinging towards her with the long vigorous strides she had come to connect with the Duc could keep her trembling long after he had passed . Night after night , she dreamed that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood and violence and disgrace that had seemed so real . Then she would wake , and truth would strip her of this brief comfort . She must lie chill and alone , rehearsing the tragedy against her will , ruthlessly recalling every step that had led on to disaster.  |p337He  is dead and gone , lady , He is dead and gone . What was the rest of the song ? She racked her brain to remember . At last it came : At his head a grass-green turf , At his heels a stone . But , no , even that had been denied him . Somewhere he had been laid away in secret shame . They had not dared to put his name above that spot . She alone out of all the world did not hate or revile him . " We can only judge another , " she thought , " as that person affects us . " Whatever had been his passion and weakness , he had never meant to hurt her . Since the day of their first meeting , he had shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to ask that she remember him so . He had been loyal and generous to her always , and nothing should mar that memory . " I play a sorry part in all this . " Those final words he had spoken came back to her now , heavy with meaning . Only God and she knew what lay behind that last futile act of fury . She knew far less than God , but enough of the life that husband and wife had lived to keep her from passing judgment . She herself was alive . The law had freed her of those charges . But would she ever be able to free herself of his presence when for six years it had dominated her world ? She would never know now what he had felt for her . Perhaps it had been love , perhaps merely the need for sympathy of which she had been the human symbol . They had asked so little of each other , and yet that little had been too much . She had not belonged to his world , or he to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up and swept them away to certain destruction . Why had she not broken away before they reached the precipice ? Why had she not heard the thunder of the rapids in time ? That was what shep338could never answer through those interminable nights and days . " If I lose my reason some day , " she heard him saying again through the hot Corsican sunshine against the blue curtain of sea , " you will know that scribbled words have driven me mad . " Calais  --  graven forever on an English Queen 's heart ; Waterloo , on Napoleon 's ; and on hers , Praslin . Time might blur that name as moss softens the inscriptions on old gravestones , but it had been cut there too deeply to be erased . The Monod brothers and their wives must have realized something of her state of mind , for they did not press her to personal confidences . They wisely refrained from advice giving , and kept her occupied as much as possible . The hours of copying sermons , helping with fine sewing and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill part of the days . But her returning energies cried out for better fare . She needed hard , stimulating work as she had never needed it before , especiallynow that the Christmas holidays were over and the dark , short days of winter stretched bleakly ahead . The Remeys did all in their power to distract her . She visited them sometimes , though she could never enter those rooms withoutfresh reminders of the tragedy which had touched all their lives . Albert had secured a few scattered pupils , but times were bad for such work ; and he missed the security of his teaching post in the Faubourg-Saint-Honore . Henriette knew this , and it troubled her to see them anxiously counting every franc and sou . She saw Madame Le Maire sometimes , and though the old woman had recovered from her first hysterical denunciations on the morning of the murder , their meetings were too full of unspokenthoughts to be comfortable . Of all the little group there was only one with whom Henriettecould talk or keep silence with complete ease . With old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what she . could not mention to others . He had the simple directness of those who work with their hands , whose brains , uncluttered by learning , remain clear and shrewd . The stubborn devotion of anp339aging sheepdog looked at her out of his eyes , and more than once she unburdened her heart to him in a small cafe near the Rue du Harlay . It was a cheap place , but the coffee was fresh and strong , and old Pierre could leave his post for half an hour of an afternoon to drink a cup with his favorite mademoiselle . " You 're fretting yourself to fiddlestrings , " he would say , peering at her disapprovingly over his lifted cup . " Did n't I tell you to get all the sleep you could ? " " Yes , you told me , Pierre , " she would admit , " hut that 's easier said than done . " " I know , mademoiselle , it 's hard when we have the black dog on our backs . " " The black dog ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Yes , he sits heavy on all our backs sometimes ; but he will go away . By spring you will forget he was ever there . " " But spring is a long way off , Pierre . " " My knees have told me that already , " he would tell her , trying to straighten out his stiff old joints . " But no matter , spring will come , and it will bring you good things . I know it . " " Oh , Pierre , what good can it bring me after all that has happened ? You know there is nothing for me in Paris , or in France for that matter . " " Then you will have to travel across the water to find your good fortune , mademoiselle  --  as far as America , maybe . " She set her cup down and stared at his seamed old face . He must have read what was in her mind , though she had not spoken of it to another person . She had indeed hardly been willingto consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ? " She tried to dismiss the subject . " Because it 's the place for you to go , " he insisted between gulps of coffee . " There 's trouble brewing in Paris . I can feel it , the way I feel a spell of bad weather in my knees while the sun is still shining . You 'll see it wo n't be long . "  |p340Queer  old fellow , she thought , croaking away like some rusty , rheumatic crow . " I , too , should go to America , " he continued . " Perhaps you will send for me when you have grown rich over there . " " But I tell you I have no intention of going to America ; and , if I had , why should you want to go there ? " " Well , I 'm an old dog that would be willing to learn new tricks , mademoiselle , new tricks in a new world  --  or perhaps even my old ones will pass for new over there . " He chuckled and dipped his brioche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Put the ocean between yourself and this trouble you 've had , " he urged her . " Go while you 're still young . " " I 'm not so young any more , " she confessed , " and I 'll carry my trouble with me whether I go or stay . " But he shook his head as he rose to go . " It 's a good thing to eat your brown bread first , " he said . " Then you 'll have plenty of white to look forward to . Do n't forgetto save a crumb for me , mademoiselle . Au revoir . Madame has no doubt been shouting herself hoarse for me these last ten minutes . " She watched him hobble off towards the Rue du Harlay and sighed at the folly of an old man 's dreams of seeing a new world . But in February old Pierre 's predictions began to be shared by most of Paris . Trouble and tension gathered in the air . " Power , " said Wronger , " is a bell which prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So it was with King Louis-Philippe and his Minister of Foreign Affairs , Guizot . The sound of that bell whose clapper they had managed to keep in motion so long drowned out nearer and more ominous rumblings . " Enrichissez-vous , " it cried out mechanically with Guizot'sown self-assured voice , but even his bourgeois supporters were growing skeptical of the refrain . How could one grow rich under a regime of government inertia and political corruption , with steadily mounting taxes issued under the guise of false pros-perity ?  |p341The  Praslin murder case was not a closed issue . A peer of France had been allowed to evade justice , and that still rankled . It had put the match to public indignation , and once the blaze was started a score of other grievances caught fire . Few guessed , least of all the complacent , seventy-year-old monarch , how briskly the dead wood that had held the Empire together would burn . Rain had been falling for days ; and a thick , smoky fog hung over all Paris . It was the nand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thronged with determined , rain-soaked people . Theodore Monod had been brought home from school at midday in charge of an older student . He reported that crowds had been thick about the Madeleine . Men in smocks and old coats , beggars and gamins and women , too , had been waiting for hours in the downpour , though no one seemed certain what they wanted . Some had shouted , " Down with Guizot , " and others had tried to sing the Girondist refrain of defiance . There had even been a bedraggled red flag or two hoisted above the heads , and one particularly ragged figure had worn a placard with something about the " right to work " in lettersthe rain had almost obliterated . Monsieur Monod confirmed his son 's report when he returned at twilight . " No one seems to know what is happening , " he answered his wife 's anxious questions . " But there has been fighting in the Champs Elysees . The Municipal Guard has come out in full force . I saw men burning benches in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me several shops had been looted . He said he saw one stripped of firearms . " " Then it must be Revolution . " Henriette heard herself speakingcalmly , almost as if she were making some comment on the weather . She did not realize the meaning of her words till she saw the color drain out of Madame Monod 's cheeks and lips , till she saw how that family drew instinctively closer together . Fear was in their faces , and suddenly that word had become a reality to them all.  |p342Troo|ps  were encamped round bonfires in the streets that night . Wet and shivering , the mobs scattered for shelter while the rain continued to fall in torrents . The easy-going old King reassured himself that the weather was on his side . The people of Paris , as he remarked to his household , were not accustomed to making revolutions in winter . But by another evening Louis-Philippe had grown less smug . Those hours of falling rain did not dampen the spirit of insurrection that charged all Paris . The crowds were sullen and dogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guizot with challenging cries : " Vive la reformelDown with Guizot ! Vive la Republique ! " The ministers and officials of France heard the shouting and waited tensely for Guizot to mount the rostrum and take his stand . It was half past one when he appeared , frail and precise and looking , as a foreign visitor described him , " a cross between a professor of French and an old actor . " But he held his head high ; he kept his old impelling manner even though he announced his resignation . His words fell like lead on the shocked ears of his supporters . " We have been betrayed , " they cried . But the victorious Leftists cheered them down , and the crowds outsidehailed the news with transports of enthusiasm . " The Royalist Government has collapsed , " Frederic Monod reported to his household when he returned late that afternoon . " Guizot has resigned , and God knows who will be his successor . There 's been no violence yet , but the National Guard has been called out as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Municipal Guard , " Henriette broke in . " Does that mean there may be fighting ? " " I fear it . Already there is disorder among the regiments . " Few slept in Paris that night . Crowds gathered on the wet and wind-swept streets , ragged coats and military uniforms making strange human patterns under the flare of torches . At nine o'clock the mob grew thicker on the Boulevard des Capucines , where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was under heavy guard . But when the marchers advanced upon the gates they were metp343by crossed Layonets . A shot rang out , and others echoed in sharp metallic patter . By early morning there had been another massacre in the Place de la Concorde . Carts were parading the dead in improvised biers under slaty skies , followed by shouting , water-soaked companies of men and women . Fresh columns of soldiers were being sent out to restore order , but when they reached the Boulevard BonneNouvelleand other important arteries of the city , they found the way blocked by rough barricades of mud and stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bedraggled red flags and equally limp banners of tricolor mingled as one company of soldiersafter another marched out , only to scatter uncertainly . Everywheremuskets were being reversed . Soldiers broke ranks and marched with the workingmen they had been sent to disperse . The Palace was in confusion . Without Guizot at his side , the King vacillated like a ship without a rudder . Orders were countermandedalmost the moment after they had been dispatched . Reform or repression  --  the King favored now one , now the other . It was as if , they said of him afterward , " he held out his right hand and shook his left fist . " There was no time to waste in argument if the Palais Bourbon was to hold its own against the rival government that was even then being formed in the Hotel de Ville . At eleven o'clock on the morning of February 24th , Louis-Philippe called his two sons and prepared to make his last royal appearance . Ile had decided upon a personal appeal to his subjects . He would review the National Troops on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Citizen Militia whose uniform he wore , and they represented the powerful bourgeoisie on whose support he had always relied . But that drizzling day , as he rode along their lines in the Carrousel , no spontaneous burst of cheers rose to greet him . Only a few half-hearted cries of " Vive le roil " answered his challenge . the air was heavy about him . He knew that he had failed . Abruptlyhe turned his horse back to the palace . An hour later thep344abdication had been signed ; he had exchanged his uniform for civilian dress and with his family had turned his back on a Paris that was no longer his capital . News of the abdication and the flight of the royal family was not generally known for some hours . In the region about the Monod home there had been less disturbance than on the day previous , and Henriette , grown restive from staying so long behindshuttered doors and windows , had ventured out upon an errand . Word had reached the household that a member of MonsieurMonod 's congregation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left some hours before , and there was no way of reaching him ; so she had volunteered to go to the sick parishioner . It was out of the question for Madame Monod to leave her children , and besides Henriette rather relished the idea of leaving the house that had held them prisoners for two long , anxious days . " No , I am not in the least afraid , " she had smiled reassuringly from the door . " It seems quiet now , and the rain has stopped . " She reached the stricken home without difficulty , making her way there by back streets . The patient was very ill . She could do nothing beyond reassuring the family that Monsieur Monod would come when he could , and that Madame Monod sent her sympathy . But when she found herself on the street once more she could not resist returning by a different route . Streets and gutters were still wet , but the clouds had broken overhead . She turned towards the Champs Elysees and made her way along familiar streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all moving in the direction of the Tuileries , but in their own haste they took no notice of her , an inconspicuous woman in bonnet and shawl . It was only when she found her path blocked suddenly by a barricade of mud and cobblestones and a struggling mass of people that she regretted her rashness in choosing that way . Hastily she turned to retrace her steps , only to be met by a crowd that had closed in behind her . Too late she realized she wasp345caught fast between two groups that had met from opposite directions , and that were now mingling like a dark mass of gigantichuman bees driven out of a hive . There was nothing to do but keep from falling under the rush of trampling feet . It took all her strength to do that . She had no time to think or feel anythingexcept the immediate necessity not to lose her footing ; to hold her own among those swaying , heavy bodies . All her life , that next hour remained a confusion of sights and sounds and smells without semblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  more like the shifting patternsof a kaleidoscope held to her eyes than an actual scene of which she was part . " Vive la reforme ! Vive la Republique ! " voices were shouting all about her  --  men 's deep voices and the thinner cries of women . She had no breath to join in . The sound rolled over her head in ( lull thunder before it was broken by distinct pattering of gunfireand the quick thud of hoofs on cobblestones . A company of soldiers bore down the street , and the crowd scattered in panic before the plunging hoofs and bared sabers . Henriette caught at an arm beside her to keep from falling as the soldiers clattered by . They passed so close that a clod of mud struck her cheek . The man she clung to was a workman . She felt the coarse cloth of his blouse under her fingers . Ills face was streaked with sweat and mud , and a gash showed over one eye . He cursed thickly and shook his fist at those riders in the uniform of the Municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoofbeats , and then the crowd closed in about a body that lay sprawled and limp where the riders had cut a path through the crowd . " Oh ! " Henriette gasped to those beside her . " Some one has been hurt , perhaps killed . We must stop . Let me get through . " But no one answered or moved to make way for her . Her lifted voice was like a cricket 's chirp protesting the roar of a waterfall . Up one street and across another to avoid more barricades , more crossed bayonets  --  it was as if an invisible flood were
