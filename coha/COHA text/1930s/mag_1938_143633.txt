McCay Before Disney <P> Sirs : <P> In your article in TIME issue of Dec. 27 regarding the accomplishments of Walt Disney , the author has failed to give credit to the man who is the father of animated cartoons and who created them almost 30 years ago at which time Mr. Disney was probably running around in rompers . <P> I refer to Mr. Winsor McCay who died about three years ago . <P> Mr. McCay was an artist in every sense of the word and his cartoons of " Little Nemo " and " Dreams of a Rarebit Fiend " that appeared in Sunday newspaper supplements were the joy and delight of the youngsters of that day . <P> His first animated cartoon showed a prehistoric animal he called " Gertie " and while <P> Mr. McCay stood in front of the screen and gave a sort of lecture , " Gertie " would bow and act as if she were responding to Mr. Mc-Cay 's instructions . <P> I am not for taking away from Mr. Disney any of the glory he justly deserves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 1 animated cartoonist of today but I am only asking for credit where credit is due . <P> HENRY W. WILSON <P> New York City <P> The late Cartoonist McCay won a dinner from skeptical George McManus and the late Cartoonist Clare Briggs when , after early experiments with a short Little Nemo film , in 1909 at the old Vitagraph Studios in Brooklyn he projected Gertie , The Dinosaur , a 1,000-ft. animated cartoon . To make it he spent $50,000 , took over a year to draw and film 10,000 pictures. - ED . <P> " Something Must Be Done " <P> Sirs : <P> ... I read with interest your comment on Rising Tide ( TIME , Dec. 20 ) . . . . <P> If democracy is to succeed something must be done . We must be receptive and have a kindly approach towards everything that looks constructive . Perhaps I was not altogether constructive or tolerant myself when my desire was that both Protestant minister and Catholic priest might have their heads knocked together until a little intolerance was knocked out of both of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fact that they say to me , " All right , we agree that present conditions are bad , but how about starting with you ? Are you part of the problem or are you part of the answer ? " The way they ask the question , however , makes a great deal of difference . They do not ask it in a belligerent or combative tone , but in a tone which has a kindly approach , which disarms antagonism , and leads to constructive cooperation . . . . <P> I have at times felt that your approach on some subjects was perhaps a little facetious , but I must grant that you know your business better than I do , and perhaps sometime you will get your own conviction on this subject . That is more important than having me tell you " where to get off . " . . . RUSSELL E. SARD <P> Washington , D. C. <P> Serious Advice <P> Sirs :                    @
