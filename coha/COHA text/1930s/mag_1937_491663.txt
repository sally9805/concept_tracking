ALL my talks about . the piano , I have neglected one of the most important things , my piano stool . This was an invention and an innovation . It took me years to learn why I did not feel comfortable when playing in public . There was always something wrong , a certain nervousness in my back . I tried many stools and , at last , at Erard 's in Paris , I found what I needed . It was the lowest one they had . So I asked them to make several such low chairs . They gave me such repose that since then I have played from no other . Of course , they become shabby and new ones are made for me . I have two now in my house , two waiting for me in London , one in Paris , several in Now York . That piano stool is part of me . It belongs to my uniform , my piaMstic equipment , my life at the piano . I always recommend to my pupils the use of a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when I use one . Conditions have so much to do with the success of one 's public appearance . The atmosphere of the ball , the lighting , the piano stool , the condition of the piano  --  these mechanical things , how they add to the nervousness and strain of each appearance . For instance , a dimly lighted hall is an absolute necessity for me . I have often been criticized and misunderstood on that score and it has been considered an affectation . But it is really nothing of the sort . I simply can not stand a brilliant light glaring into my eyes . It deprives me of all comfort and repose . I finished the orchestration of my opera . Manru , in . January , 1901 , and went on a short tour to Russia , Italy and Spain , from which I was recalled by the tragic news of the death of my son . It was , indeed , a blessing for me that I was forced to work then and plunged at once into the final details of my opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing that helped me . Final work on the opera completed , it was produced for the first time at Dresden in 1901 . My old master , Leschetizky , came from Vienna  --  that was charming . And Joseph Joachim from Berlin , and many other old friends from Warsaw , Paris , London and America . Manru was performed more than twenty times that season , and one performance was attended by Madame Sembrich and Maurice Grim , then director of New York 's Metropolitan Opera . They then decided to produce the opera in the next New York season with Sembrich . I had to attend the rehearsals . This was not only expected but urgently requested by Gran . Padereivskl versus Paderewskl rrillE New York premiere was very well received . 1 Sembrich was quite marvelous , and Bandrowski , the German tenor I had recommended for the leading male role , excellent . Walter Damrosch conducted , and very well indeed . There was some slight difficulty with David Bispham in the secondary role of a Polish village sorcerer . At the dress rehearsal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried backstage and told him that it was not suitable to represent a Polish peasant in a fez . " Oh , my friend , I am so sorry , " ho apologized . " I thought this sorcerer was a Turk . " I was on a big concert tour that season , and it happened that my Carnegie Hall recital took place the same day as the second performance of Manru at the Metropolitan . Both performances were completely sold out , which caused a facetious comment on the part of one critic , who headed his article : " Paderewski Fighting Paderewski ! " It was then that . my recitals wore always sold out , as we say , and the audiences first began their famous rush in a body to the stage the moment the program was finished . Why ? It is very simple , I think  --  the spell of the music is still upon them . They want it to continue . It is a strong and subtle bond that holds the audience and the artist together during a performance . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , to whom I become accustomed , know exactly where they are to be found , look for them . A certain family will be in one special place in the hall , another very near the front , where they can watch my hands . There was in New York a very handsome gentleman with rather a plain-looking daughter who came to every recital of mine for twenty-five years . Suddenly they were not there , and it was a shock to me . I was so interested that I made inquiries . They had gone back to Germany . He had been in business in New York and had retired and returned home . I never played again in New York without missing those unknown friends . One always has an extraordinary sense of welcome when one returns to New York . It is an audience of friends . In that respect , there is no other place in ' the world like it  --  a most inspiring atmosphere . As a mark of friendship I have , of course , received many gifts , as an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great violinist , from every journey through Russia , returned with trunks of jewelry , cigarette boxes , watches , furs , and what not . I do not know why , but I have more often been treated as someone who should rather give than receive . It is a law of my life , I think . I have been presented with some souvenirs , mostly in America , and particularly from my compatriots , there , Polish emigrants . I have often been presented , during prohibition , with some fine bottles cleverly concealed in baskets of flowers . This watch that I always carry with such affection was given ale by my dear friend , Montgomery Sears , of Boston , during my first tour in America , as a mark of appreciation for playing at his birthday fete . Twice I had unusual gifts made to me , but not as tokens of admiration . Quite the contrary , in fact  --  with remarks that hurt me . Before the war , I received a letter with a document . which read as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated in such and such a district , such and such a county , containing some sixty or seventy acres , with such and such buildings , in order to establish there a school of agriculture for young peasants , and the school shall forever bear his name , Paderewski , " That was touching . But with the document there was a letter of explanation which was not so touching . It said , " You should not imagine that this is done in order to show you my appreciation of your musical ability and accomplishments . Not at all ! I do not care for music . But I have heard you play several times and I have also heard your addresses , and I know that you are an honorable man , one to be trusted , worthy of this mark of esteem and confidence . " Well , it was certainly a strange communication , admitting me as an honest man , though repudiating me as an artist . But there was one gift that came to me absolutely without restrictions  --  a gift outright , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was from a. poor Polish workman , who , in 1930 , left me everything he had in the world  --  fifty dollars . When I got that little check , I wept . And the message with it touched me as few things in life have ever touched me . On a little piece of paper he had written , " All I have I leave to you . " It was a princely gift . I never knew him . For years I tried to find out where he is buried , but I never could . The undying memory of this gift is the only monument I can raise to him . And now comes a very important time in my life  --  a change of work and mood . I am now approaching the year 1903 , the most important year in my activity as a composer . I decided then to stop playing for a year and write something , and remained almost the entire year at Morges , and began to compose . First of all . I wrote my piano sonata , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is extremely difficult , and for that reason will never be very popular . The second work was the completion of my third set of variations , which I had begun years before while still in Strasbourg . I retained only a few variations from that period , and wrote a series of new ones , ending with the fugue . This work is my best piano composition , I think . It is extremely difficult and , perhaps , too long , but it contains quite a few things which were then almoht a revelation in their character and novelty . The Supreme Pleasure  --  Creative Work 1XTITFIIN a fortnight I wrote twelve French VV songs to the words of Catulle Mendes , After that , I wrote a sketch of my symphony . That took me several months . The orchestration was done several years later . That composition was written in commemoration of the last Polish revolution of 1563 . When these compositions were finished , I had , of course , to return to my piano again . I needed money and I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolific year artistically . I never enjoyed myself more in my art than during that year . Creative work , take it as you will , is the only thing in life that gives supreme satisfaction . Ideas are eternal . In presenting them , you reach the heights . The form of presentation makes no difference . By creative work you are giving yourself new life . Creative work kills death . While you are composing , you live in an atmosphere which excludes practicing , because practicing is practically spade work , the drudgery . It is the tragic-side of a musical artist , that necessity of continuous practicing . If you are a painter , a sculptor or an architect , if you are an engineer , you learn that , in a sense , forever . You can go for years without using the brush or the pencil , and yet , when you start again , you have the same ability . With a musician , this is absolutely impossible . Yes , for the pianist , practice is constant torture and privation . It deprives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in life , It prevents you from reading , from thinking , from developing your intellect . Even now , I still need four or five hours a day of practicing with the concentration of mind that does not admit any intrusion . It is slavery . It has , to be sure , its pleasant moments , but it is almost as Gounod is credited with once saying about Warner 's music , " Yes , there are divine moments , but oh , the unbearable hours ! " I am often asked by students if it is necessary now and then to rest the hands completely . Yes , absolutely . It is also very beneficial . I experienced that to the highest ' degree some years ago when , through my political activities , I stopped playing altogether . I did not touch the piano then for more than two years , and that was the time when my arm  --  always so troublesome  --  got so much better and my fingers became strong again . But I have never had time to rest my bands regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tour was over , I had to prepare at once for another . Ah , that is terrible -- that feeling of haste . I know of nothing worse except that recurrent dream of mine in which I am obliged to play something I have not yet prepared , or not prepared sufficiently . The audience , the orchestra , are waiting . and they come for me to take me to the platform , and I go out and sit down at the piano unprepared  --  ah , that is agony , indescribable . In May , 1904 , I went to Australia for the first time , after concerts in Poland , in Russia  --  my last there  --  in Germany and England . We sailed from Marseilles , my wife and I , both in poor health , so we took our Paris physician , Doctor Rutynski . He became ill at once , appeared on deck for the first time at Suez , just strong enough to take a little walk , returned to his bunk and was not seen again until Colombo . Between there and Melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Altogether , he was a total loss as a doctor . It was a vile passage and I was suffering with my nerves and my stomach . The heat in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean was appalling , then we reached Australia in the bitter midwinter cold of July . Australia was not a place to go when one was ill . We found a comfortable apartment at . the hotel finally , but really could not get anything to eat . The food was excruciatingly bad . We lived almost entirely at first upon pineapples , pleasant to the taste , but not very nourishing . So my wife decided to do the cooking herself , and every morning went with Mr. Adlington , our manager , to the markets to buy food , which she cooked in our rooms . Except for the food , that first Australasian tour was enjoyable . I had , in Sydney , a concert with orchestra , and there comes the triangle story . The orchestra was unionized , and the conductor , Signor Hazon , warned me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the fixed time could be used for rehearsing , as ( Continued on Pogo 96 ) they would all leave me alone at my piano . Such were the union orders . I had to play three concertos , the last one being the F Minor Concerto by Chopin . In the orchestra arrangement I used to play , there are , in the last movement of that concerto , some eight or nine strokes of the triangle . The rehearsal had to be stopped when there were still about five or six minutes necessary to finish the last movement . I addressed a few words to the orchestra , asking them to please be gracious enough to continue , in order to let me play just once the remaining part of the finale . They all consented , when , suddenly , the triangle player , who had not once struck his important instrument , said , " Now we have played enough . We must stop . It is time to go to lunch . " All of them got up and left . Now , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was receiving the same amount of money as the first-violin player and all the other orchestra members who were supposed to be soloists . He  --  the triangle player  --  had not even moved once his precious hand . Well , there was nothing to be done . I asked Signor Hazon who was that important artist , that great triangle player , and he said , " He is important in the union , but he is not an artist at all . He is just a cigar-shop keeper . " And now the obvious question : Did the triangle come in on time at the concert that night ? No . Certainly not ; he came in in the wrong place . I take only one meal a clay  --  after the concert . This was very unfortunate in New Zealand , because , as we soon discovered , no hotel kitchen was allowed to stay open after dinner was served , and as my first meal of the day was always toward midnight , even later , I could get nothing to eat . So everywhere we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could only have a bit of cold meat or fish . So poor Mr. Adlington was always negotiating with the union authorities about my food . And it was extremely expensive too . We were obliged to pay for the extra service , the cook , his assistant and several others . We actually had to pay four fees ; then , in addition , all these people expected very large tips . This is because the money we paid did not go into their pockets but went to the union . A Most Accomplished Parrot But that tour is best remembered by me for the advent of an important member into my family , Coekey Roberts , u parrot who filled me with affection , amusement and considerable agony as long as he was with us , and Ibis is his story . I think I have said before that there have been three creatures in my life which have shown an unmistakable interest in my art . Cockey Roberts was the third . I shall always believe that he was genuinely interested in my playing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obliged to postpone my first concert . The weather was bad , we knew no one , and the days were tedious . My Australian manager conceived the idea of buying us a parrot , a parrot that talked  --  and talked as no parrot ever talked before , I am sure . That was Cockey Roberts . My wifewas so entranced with him that she bought some thirty other parrots , with which we traveled through Australia and New Zealand and on to San Francisco . How did I endure it ? Ah , I do not know , except that I am an animal of ' infinite patience ; if I were not. , I should have been dead long since . But Coekey Roberts was more than a parrot ; he was a real artist in his way  --  and a friend . He talked almost without interruption , and his vocabulary was extremely rich , but not of the best choice . He swore in a terrible way when you displeased him , using the worst possible expressions . But it was a great pleasure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant amusement . " Look here , " he would cry , " have a drink . Have a drink . " And he spoke very clearly  --  so distinctly that . once , when we were driving in Auckland , we put the cage with the parrot on the seat with the coachman , and suddenly , in a perfectly kind , human voice , we heard , " Look here . Have a drink , wo n't you ? " And the coachman turned round and said , very politely , touching his cap , " Oh , no , thank you , sir : I have had one already . " Cockey Roberts  --  Mitsic Lover Cockey Roberts lived with us for some seven years . He was here at Morges , an important member of the family . He was an excellent traveler , though he did not like rough weather on board ship ; quite especially when we were traveling from New Zealand to Tasmania on that famous Tasman Sea , which is the roughest in the world , he suffered  --  and swore ! Cockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabin to the other , and the poor parrot did not . understand what was the matter . He was in a state of wild fury . " Oh , you wretches , you wretches ! " he would . scream . " Go to hell ! Go to hell ! " And now I must confess something ! We arrived in New Zealand not only with Cockey Roberts  --  but with thirty-six other parrots . We had them distributed in various cages , some ten or twelve in one and four in another , and so on . But there was one parrot among them that was perfectly tremendous in size and with a voice that was to be heard round the world . He traveled in an enormous cage by himself . We finally had to part with him ; he was im-. possible . I was only too delighted when a veterinary from Geneva came one day to see him and I suggested that he take the parrot home with him . He had a very large house and big garden near Geneva . He took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and really one had to laugh at the thought  --  got into a fight immediately , and with a cow , and was killed . A most ignominious but absurd ending . Ah , but Cockey Roberts was Parrot No , 1 . He was a beautiful , lovable bird . But such a voice , especially when he was angry ! In spite of his voice , I loved that parrot and he loved me . I could do anything with him . He always came to have his neck scratched . and he was delighted when I touched him . He used to come regularly to my room when I was practicing . I tried to avoid him and would close the ( Conelnued on Page OBI THE SRTURDAY ( Continued /earn Page 96 ) doors . When that happened , he would knock sharply with his beak . At first I would keep very quiet .. Then he would knock again , a little harder , and I would call out through the door , " Who is there ? Who is it ? " Then an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who ? " I would say , pretending not to understand , and then that angry and shrill voice would call again , " Cockey Roberts ! Cockey Roberts ! " Of course I had to let him in after that , and he would walk straight to the piano and perch there on my foot for helms while I practiced , and the pedaling  --  which is often very furious , as you know  --  did not seem to disturb him in the least .. He would sit perfectly still on the top of my foot . And then , from time to time , he would say in a very loving but scratchy voice , " Oh , Lord , how beautiful ! How beautiful ! " Ah , it was touching . When I stopped and got up , as I generally did once during my practice , he understood perfectly that there would he no playing for some little lime , and then he would walk about t he room and amuse himself . But he did not leave me ; he stayed close until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could be persuaded to go to his own little room , and there he would sit on his perch , very quiet . But whenever I played , he felt that his place was by my side . I remember , one day in San Francisco , he did something very unpleasant . We arrived there with all our parrots and then decided to reduce the personnel . Mr. Adlington took a couple , the doctor took a few and we left some with a friend in San Francisco . Still there were some fifteen that we brought back t o Morges . Quite enough . But Cockey Roberts had always the place of honor . In that big old Palace Hotel in San Francisco , we kept him always in the large drawing room . The cage stood in the corner , and sometimes for hours you could not hear a sound from the bird , and then , oh , what . language  --  what a torrent of had words ! Censuring the Press Shortly after my arrival in San Francisco , a lady reporter asked for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to see her , and I asked Mr. Adlington to explain this . But my wife intervened , saying she was probably a poor girl and that I must see her for a few minutes . She was always intervening in such eases , and especially when it was a woman reporter . So I received her , but I said at once that I was very busy and that she should please restrict her curiosity and make her questions brief . But she was very persistent . She stayed more than half an hour , and evidently intended to continue on and on . Finally , I said , " Madame , I really can not talk further because I have to play , I have to work . My duty is here , not with the newspaper . You must excuse me . " " But , " she insisted , " only a few questions more , please . " Suddenly a tremendous angry voice ' came from the parrot : " Go away , I do n't like your voice . Go away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a parrot and not a person speaking . The poor reporter was completely deceived . She thought . it was the voice of my wife . She jumped from her chair and started toward the door . " Oh . thank you , madame , " she said , turning toward my wife . " You have already EVENING POST been very kind to me. 1 must apologize humbly for being so indiscreet in keeping Mr. Paderowaki so long . " She would listen to nothing we said , and almost ran out of the room . And it was Cockey Roberts who did this . It was unbelievable ! That little bird had a soul . In February , we arrived at Canton , Ohio , Mr. McKinley 's home town . My wife was taken ill and I asked Mr. Adlington to fetch a physician . Something had happened to the steam pipes in our ear , and we had absolutely no heat . It was frightfully cold , so I put on my fur coat . Cockey Roberts was covered in his cage with another fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Retreat to Nature While I was waiting there in the dining room of the car for the physician , I was feeling very sad and very anxious , and suddenly a muffled , hoarse voice said , " I would like to have breakfast in Australia . " Poor Cockey Roberts ! His vocabulary was something amazing , uncanny . It had thousands of words . He lived on here with us , and his voice finally became unbearable . In fact , when he was displeased with anything  --  and he was frequently displeased  --  his shrieking seemed to act directly on my spine . I had to prepare then for a serious concert tour , and so we decided to put him , for the summer , in with the poultry in the garden , where be had a very nice house all to himself . Ile was perfectly satisfied , apparently . He talked to the poultry , swore at them , too , and sometimes he talked to the gardener . Every day he would cry for me , and I saw him often , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very early that year , in September . It was still very warm , and somehow  --  I do n't know how it happened  --  he was neglected . My sister had not arrived and there were only the servants to look after him . Suddenly , an unexpected frost came and they left him out , uncovered , in the poultry house , and he caught a cold that killed him . I was then in New York , and I remember that the whole of one night I dreamed of Cockey Roberts . I saw him , and I heard his funny , shrill , angry voice , and it did not seem so unpleasant to me in my dreams . And somehow , I knew then that Cockey Roberts was dead , and there was a very empty little place in my heart . Ten days afterwards we received the sad news from Morges that poor Cockey Roberts was no more . From San Francisco , I went to Arden , the Modjeskas ' place near Santa Ana . Stanford White had designed them a beautiful cottage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the several days we spent there we never saw the sun . All was forlorn . Mofijeska was already old and looking ill . I used all my persuasion to induce them to leave the place , but instead came that idea of hers to arrange a farewell benefit performance for herself in New York . The details were left to me and I was to play at the benefit , as she had played for mine when I was a struggling young musician . But toward the end of that American tour , my train was derailed between Utica and Albany . No one was seriously injured , thank God , but several of my party were badly knocked about ; I most of all . I had been pitched violently against a table and was left ' bruised and lame and with my nerves badly shaken . I was obliged to cease playing for several months and , saddest of all , could not play at Modjeska 's benefit . There was a great rallying of her friends and admirers , however , and with the proceeds she bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy . It is very hard when an artist must cease working before he dies . Re should die in harness , on the battlefield  --  still at the beloved job . Because of the accident , I did not play again in 1005 , and when I made a tour of Spain , Portugal and Southern France in 1906 , I found myself bating the piano . I loathed it . This aversion lasted several years ; still I was obliged to play and , naturally , it showed in my playing . Yes , I felt it ; it was very inferior . Partly it was due to a disagreement with the Steinways which led to their withdrawing their piano from my use . For several years I played the Weber piano in America , In Europe , I played the tram ' , in which they recently had introduced a patented iron plate , making it extraordinarily heavy to play . Really , it was a complication of things too subtle to disentangle now and of no interest , really , to our story . Whatever the causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played , I did not feel in touch with the instrument . The doctors said I was overwrought , that I had abused myself and the piano , and that I must not only cease playing but must find another interest . Finally , one of my friends here at Lausanne , a great physician and a wise man , said : " Now , tell me . What is there that interests you outside of the intellectual ? " That was easily answered . I was of an agricultural family and farming always had interested me . " Good ; go and farm , and Nature will heal you , " be counseled me . When I protested that my hands still might be necessary to me later on , he said that he did not mean that I do actual field work myself  --  naturally  --  but to live close to Nature . Metamorphosis of a Farrn That appealed to me at once . I took a little farm . It interested me from the beginning , and it helped me because I had to live a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful countryside . I went there in the autumn and continued throughout the winter . That simple life brought a kind of healing with it . But things happened , as they always do , and it soon became a white elephant on my hands , because I began buying and adding land to it all the time . It got bigger and bigger . I bought cows and pigs and other livestock , and became a real farmer . Even when I was playing again , my farm was still in operation and cost me a great deal of money  --  a very great deal more than my ten fingers could make . Now , during that time I did not practice at all . No , I did not touch the piano , but after a few months with my new acquisition , which was growing so rapidly and so expensively , that little farm of mine made me begin to think about money very seriously , and I was obliged to play . The rest had already done me some good and I became a lit-tle more friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few concerts here in Switzerland for charity  --  to break the ice , so to speak  --  and then , in spite ncentineed an Page 101 ) ( Cerrtinu  --  d from Page OBI of my continued aversion to the piano , I started a tour in America in 1907 . During that tour I played at the White House by invitation , and President Theodore Roosevelt made a deep impression on 1710 . I played there many times later . These White House musicals were much the same . whoever the President . I do not think that President Wilson had any particular interest in music . President Taft was more interested in it , perhaps . than Theodore Roosevelt . President Coolidge , strangely enough , seemed most interested of all . I think he liked music for itself , and liked it even more because , while music was going on , he did not have to talk . Yet when I lunched with Mr. Coolidge at the White House once , he talked all the time . True , there were only the two of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say anything . After luncheon , he had his cigar and I my cigarette , and he talked continuously . He had something to say too . He had , I assure you , and he was very firm in his convictions . Without particularly looking it , he was a very strong man and highly intelligent . It was in the midst of this tour that all my old aversion to the piano returned . I found it impossible to go on . I returned to Europe ; I tried all kinds of treatments , not only doctors and drugs but every suggestion . One physician even tried hypnotism , but that proved to be useless . And so it went from bad to worse . I was deeply discouraged . Again 1 tried , in 1909 , to play , but it was impossible . The easiest pieces in my repertoire defied me . My fingers were like cotton . I could not produce the tone , The slightest action was an effort . So I concluded not to play at all . I had a new idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely . Years before , I had dreamed of a monument to commemorate the battle of Oriineweld , Poland 's great victory over the Teutonic knights in 1410 . The five-hundredth anniversary would occur on July 15 , 1910. . /7 Dream Fulfilled In Paris , in the Polish art colony , I found a poor student sculptor , consumptive and unknown , but of high talent . I invited him lo my house at Merges , sent him to a doctor in Lausanne , a dear friend of mine , who made him well . It was a kind of miracle to all of us . His monument was finished and cast . in January , 1910 , and everything happened as I had dreamed it continuously since I was eleven . The monument was erected in Cracow , and it really is a beautiful creation . And for that gifted youth , Antoni Wiwulski , it was a great thing too .

The fulfillment of this dream of my Youth came as a happy diversion for ' Me at that critical moment of ill health . It occupied me wholly . Poland then was very much oppressed and the spirit of the people low .

I do not know when I shall play again . " If I could not play , then would I deliver the opening address ? I agreed . It was not bad . In my opinion , that address was just as satisfactory as if I had played . Virtuoso at Bay By 1911 , although I had not conquered my distaste for the piano , I still had to work . So I went on tour in South America , and playing was an untold torture to me throughout that trip . Feeling a little better by 1912 , I went to South Africa .

I went immediately to the drawing room , and saw there a very nice-looking lady . She seemed greatly agitated , and I asked why she had come . Whereupon she said , " Oh , M. Paderowski , I am hero for your autograph , of course . I must have it now .

I am too busy . I must be present at a reception then , and later on I have a dinner party ; so I must have your autograph now . I am too busy to conic to you again . I shall not leave here until you give it to me . " And she rose and took her stand in front of the door . Well , I confess I was terrified . Just imagine the situation . There was no hope for me ; I could not escape . I bowed to the inevitable . I wrote the autograph . Only once before in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . Some years before , in Leipzig , I was confronted not only by one lady but by two rather charming young girl 's , Americans . I had just given a concert for-the benefit of Liszt 's monument in Weimar . The next morning , without any notice , the two suddenly appeared in my thawing room . They just walked in without being announced ; probably having bribed one of the attendants at the hotel . They were smiling , but very determined . They had brought autograph books with them and demanded that I sign them . Of course , I took the books at once  --  there was really nothing else to do  --  and signed them . But whilst I was writing my autograph , one of the young ladies opened her little bug and drew out , with a flourish , a pair of scissors . Now , I must regretfully admit I had much more hair than I have at this moment . It was often an object of comment , and sometimes curiosity and even admiration . When I saw the scissors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized her fell purpose . I did not stand on ceremony . I jumped from my chair and said , " What are you going to do ? What do you want with those scissors ? " " Oh , we want some locks of your beautiful hair , " the young lady answered , moving swiftly toward me , scissors in hand . " Oh , no ! " I cried . " No ! I refuse absolutely . " And I moved quickly a little farther away from her but it was useless . The young ladies drew closer . Quicker and quicker I moved backward as they advanced toward me , and finally I simply turned and ran for my life , through the drawing room , into the next room , on to my bedroom , and then through my room and on to the room of my servant . They were close upon me , and as a last resort , I saw that there was still another room with a door half open . It was a room belonging to someone else  --  whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and locked the door . Thank Ood it held . One Samson and two Delilah . An unfair advantage . A Lesson In Quantitative Music That South African venture was not successful . My prices , as usual under the British flag , were from one pound to one guinea . In Pretoria  --  one of the few places in the colony with a large enough white population to produce an audience interested in music -- I played to a crowded and appreciative house . But the next day I read in the local paper ; " Think of a foreigner , a mere piano player , who has the effrontery to charge one pouud to hear him . What robbery ! Why , we had here not long ago , in our best theater , an artist who played the clarinet , the violin , triangle , drums and accordion , all these instruments hirmillaneoasly , and his price was only a shilling . " During my next American tour , a severe attack of neuritis in my right arm disabled me at Seattle . I canceled my concert there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine insisted that I go at once to Paso Robles and take the mud baths . Well , I was cured in three weeks and tilled every one of my engagements . A miracle I It was in February , 1014 , that I bought my ranch in Paso Robles . There were two reasons for buying that large property , which has since caused me so much trouble and expense . First , I was under a feeling of great gratitude to the place itself . Secondly , I was persuaded constantly , and , I may say , almost violently , by an attach ? of the establishment , who ti had a decided passion for the real-estate business . He was as interested in that as he was in the patients . It had its amusing side , of course , because I was helpless  --  at his mercy . His attacks upon me took place when I was in the baths , in mud up to my neck . I could not protest , I could not resist , and he never let up . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a willing victim , for I really loved the place . I developed the place greatly . I planted many hundreds of acres of almond trees , prune trees , walnut trees , and even a vineyard , which , for a time , had great success because of the Swiss-Italian colonists who live not far away , who bought the grapes to make their own wine . But it is expensive to keep up . After my return from the American tour . I came directly to Merges . Already at the beginning of July I had several unexpected but important visitors whose object was not difficult to guess . They talked about certain possible changes in the map of Europe . War was in the air . The thirty-first of July , the day of my patron saint , St. Ignace , has always been a day of festivity in my house . All the countryside , people from Geneva , Lausanne and elsewhere , come with their greetings . It is one of the most touching things that have come into my life , this lovely gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , lots of them , in their pretty white dresses , with bouquets and little gifts , sometimes to sing to me and sometimes to dance or say a poem . It is all very touching . The festivities go on all day . A luncheon is served to all the visiting friends , and the good will and gaiety  --  and , I may add , food  --  go on all the afternoon . The luncheon at this special festivity was a big one and friends came from all over the world . Now there is something that I must mention here in connection with a certain gentleman who was head of a strong political party in Poland . He had arrived that morning to join in celebrating my fete day . War 's Ominous Overture During the luncheon I had to acknowledge with thanks all those who came to give me the evidence of their affection . In my little address I said that in spite of our happiness at being together , we must all realize that it was a moment of extreme gravity , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , perhaps , swaying in the balance , that the ominous mutterings of war were already vibrating through the land , and that if war came , my own country , Poland , would be among the first to suffer , I felt sure . She would be torn with battle and would become a sea of blood and tears , but she would emerge free at the end  --  please God ! It was a tense moment for everyone at the table , broken by the quick retort of our political friend , who jumped to his feet and answered rather gaily and protestingly , saying I was too pessimistic , there was no cause for alarm , that there would be no war , that conditions were not yet ready for war , and so on . They all drew a long breath when he sat down , and leaned back in their chairs as coffee was brought in by the butler . But as the last cup was served , a telegram was handed to this gentleman . He opened it quickly and sat staring at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and came to my side . " I am sorry , " he whispered , " but I must leave at once . I do not understand why , but they are calling me to return immediately . " In a second he was gone from the room . After a few minutes I excused myself and joined him in the hail . He was still stunned and overcome at his orders , but still protesting , still denying as ho shook hands , saying " There will be no war . It is impossible , I tell you . No one is ready . We can not have war now . " This was an ominous interlude for me and the few people who noticed his departure . But the day went on with gaiety and happiness , and the dinner that night was a beautiful one . All my dear personal friends had decided to make this day a memorable one . During the evening , a rather large number of my visitors who were young and middle-aged Swiss gentlemen arrived for supper , and I noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rather strange . Nothing happened until we were seated at table , when the supper was interrupted by the telephone , which rang continuously . Every few moments one of these Swiss gentlemen was called to the telephone and obliged to leave the table . It was noticeable and very strange . My Guests Depart in Uniform There was also a peculiar atmosphere among all the guests . Everyone , without knowing why , was under the impression that something was about to happen . It affected the whole gathering and threw a strange gloom over the gaiety at supper . As you know , Austria had already declared war on Serbia after the ghastly Serbian tragedy , and there were daily increasing rumors in the newspapers more than justifying our unrest , our fears and nervousness . What next ? The tension increased hourly , but the matter did not become quite clear until late that night . Suddenly , from another room , all my Swiss guests appeared . at the door in military uniform ! That explained the valises they had carried . They were all very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Au revoir , and perhaps good-by . " It was a dreadful moment . I found myself unable to say anything . As the last one left the room , I ventured to ask , " Where are you go ing , my friend ? " " To the frontier , " he answered . It would be interesting to recapture now , if one could , the awful sense of the moment when that staggering news reached us . It fell upon the wholi , household with dreadful import . The next day , August first , the Central Powers declared war on Russia . I went out alone and walked to the station , and there I saw the two brothers Morax , both in uniform , guarding the station . I went to the post office , and there I found another friend , Gustave Dork , guarding the telegraph . We saluted , but had no word to speak . War was upon us . " This is the end of my artistic life for a time , " I said to myself . " Perhaps forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My heart was heavy . War had come ! A silent pall lay over that whole beautiful , peaceful countryside . A pall , alas , that was not to lift its black curtain for many years .
