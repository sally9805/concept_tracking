Representing their electorates last week were three Senators who will never know what it is like to fidget through a filibuster . Reason : they were elected to fill vacancies from November 9 through January 2 , and the Senate will not sit until January 3 . <P> With her mother , a stenographer and a clerk , grey-haired , bustling Interim Senator Gladys Pyle ( Rep. ) drove all the way from South Dakota to Washington " because , " she said , " I would n't feel like a Senator unless I did . " First woman to serve in the South Dakota Legislature , Senator Pyle was a candidate for Governor two years ago . As soon as she arrived in Washington , she personally screwed her nameplate on the door of her temporary office ; spoke at a luncheon of the Republican National Committee ; had a look at the Capitol ; hurried down to the Interior Department to discuss " South Dakota problems " ; drew doodles on a pink Senate memo pad . " This life , " she exclaimed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant Barry ( Rep. ) from Oregon spent about as much money getting elected as he will be paid for serving ( $1,511.12 , plus $1,818 for five clerks ' salaries and $18.75 for stationery ) . A Portland lawyer and one-time State Liquor Commissioner , Senator Barry worries more about his girth than a Senator ought to . His successor , full-time Senator Rufus C. Holman , will be the fourth Senator in the seat within eleven months . <P> Plump , ruddy-faced Interim Senator Thomas More Storke ( Dem. ) of California is editor and publisher of the Santa Barbara News-Press . He has long been such a close friend of his neighbor , Senator-reject William Gibbs McAdoo , that California papers call him " Deputy Senator . " In Washington he knew enough not to take the 20 job-hunting letters he received every day too seriously . Instead he read Jim Farley 's instructive autobiography , dined with friends at the Shoreham Hotel , danced to his favorite tune- The Last Roundup . " This is just a honey-moon , " he said . <P> Meanwhile , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totted up the financial and political rewards of the two months he served in 1936-37 . His accomplishments , he said , were to 1 ) land a couple of WPA projects , 2 ) help a man get out of jail , 3 ) get some Congressional Directories and Capitol calendars for friends back home . His rewards : he has enough stationery to last the rest of his natural life ; he gets invited out a lot more than he used to be . " For instance , " he says , " I now go to two or three funerals a week . "
