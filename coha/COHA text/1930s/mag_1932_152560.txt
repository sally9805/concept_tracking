Seven Butte residents had been killed in a motor crash near Missoula . <P> A ghastly murder had been committed on the Flats below the city ! <P> The White House had been blown up by Bonus rioters ! <P> PRESIDENT HOOVER HAD BEEN ASSASSINATED ! <P> Had such rumors started in any U. S. city save one last fortnight they would have been exceedingly short-lived . But in Butte , these and many another shocking , terrifying story flew through the city , throve and multiplied like bats in darkness . For Butte 's 40,000 inhabitants were without a local newspaper for two weeks . <P> Because union printers refused to take a $1-a-day cut the Montana Standard and Butte Post ' had shut down . Last week the printers yielded and publication was resumed . <P> During the news shut-down both the Standard and Post kept staffs busy night &; day writing bulletins for the office windows . Perpetual crowds filled the streets outside the offices , devouring the brief notices which told them that the White House had not been blown up ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 22 , son of onetime U. S. Senator Simon Guggenheim of Colorado , copper tycoon , was in town for pleasure , not to stimulate Montana 's somnolent copper industry . The newshungry also learned by bulletin what they could about the results of the Olympic Games , the gist of President Hoover 's acceptance speech , the trial of Mayor Walker . <P> Local radio stations , cooperating with the newspapers , made few news announcements . Most publishers in neighboring cities likewise refrained from taking advantage of the situation , even rejected new mail subscriptions , with two exceptions . From Denver , Publisher Fred G. Bonfiis shipped bundles of his noisy Post into Butte . From Seattle came supplies of Hearst 's Post-Intelligencer . A Butte Post office boy , en route from the post office with the day 's load of " exchanges , " was waylaid by news-starved passersby who offered him 50 a copy . He was incorruptible . <P> Hundreds of persons telephoned daily to the newspaper offices to learn the progress of their favorite comic strips .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
