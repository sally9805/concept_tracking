Duff rose . In spite of all the delay this weak young man had caused him , he found it difficult to view the matter as sternly as he should . This was the sort of news he had been waiting for , praying for , and now that it had come , his heart was light and he was extremelyhappy . " I have no time for you , " he said . " What you have told me here you are not to repeat unless I ask you to do so . Is that understood ? " " Perfectly , sir . " " You are not to leave your present position or home without advising me of your whereabouts . With these restrictions , things go on as usual . Tell your wife she was right , and give her my compliments . " He left the waiter wilted and perspiring in the manager 's office , and walked with jaunty air to the street . Pleasant , a bit of snow after so much rain . Just what London needed . Pretty good climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man on his toes , full of vim and energy . Martin 's story , it will be seen , had completely altered Inspector Duff 's outlook on life . He walked along , considering what the waiter had told him . " Mr. Drake is in room 29 , Martin . We have changed rooms for the night . " In that case . Drake must have been murdered in room 29 . But in the morning , he was back in his own bed in room 28 . Well , it all fitted in with what Duff had thought at the time . " Something tells me that Hugh Morris Drake was murdered elsewhere , " he had said . That something had been right . Duff had been right . Not such a fool , if you came right down to it . The inspector'sspirits soared . Back in his own bed in the morning . Who hadP101put him there ? Honywood , of course . Who had murdered him ? Who but Honywood ? But stop a bit . If Honywood intended murder , why the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door open between them and free access to the person of Hugh Morris Drake . Yet he had already stolen the housekeeper 's key . Such a ruse was hardly necessary . And if he was intending murder , would he have calmly involved himself by telling Martin of the change of rooms ? No , he would n't . Duff came down a bit from the clouds . The matter did n't work out quite so neatly as he had thought it would . Puzzles still . But one thing was certain , Honywood was mixed up in it somehow . Martin 's story would bring the New York millionaire back from the Continent in a hurry . And once they had him again at the Yard , the skein would begin to unravel . Dull went back and tried again . It did n't appear likely that Honywood had intended murder when he changed rooms with Hugh Morris Drake , and then told Martin what had been done . No  --  the resolution must have come later . Perhaps that cablegram Going to the near-by cable office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a show of authorityhe was handed a copy of the message Drake had received on the evening of February sixth . It was merely a business communication . " Directors voted price increase in effect July first hope you approve . " The cablegram was not the answer , evidently . But Duff blessed that cablegram none the less . Taking a taxi to the Yard , he called the home of his superior . That gentleman , torn away from a game of bridge , was inclined at first to be short and crisp . But as Duff 's story unrolled , he began to share the excitement of his subordinate . " Where is the travel party now ? " he inquired . " According to the schedule , sir , they are leaving Paris for Nice to-night . They will be in Nice for three days . " " Good . You will take the regular Riviera Express from Victoria in the morning . Nothing to be gained by starting sooner . That will bring you into Nice early on Saturday . I shall see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We appear to be getting somewhere at last . " And the superintendent went back to play four hearts , doubled . After a happy chat with Hayley over the telephone , Duff went to his rooms and packed a bag . At eight in the morning he was in the superintendent 's office . His superior took a package of bank-notes from the safe , where money was kept for just such occasions , and handed it over . " You have your ticket booked , I presume ? " " Yes , sir . I 'll pick it up on my way to the station . " " Have the French police hold Honywood for us in Nice until I can get the necessary papers . I 'm taking the matter up with the Home Office at once . Good-by , Mr. Duff , and the best of luck . " Action was what Duff had wanted , and he rode down to Dover in high spirits . The channel crossing was rough , but that meant nothing to him . By eveningthey were on the outskirts of Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceinture , with many interminable stops . Duff was relieved when they finallyp 103reached the Gare de Lyon , and the road to the Riviera stretched straight before them . As he sat enjoying an excellent dinner , and watching the last walls of Paris disappear into the dusk , he thought deeply about Mr. Walter Honywood . No wonder the man had been in such a funk the morning after the murder . If only , Duff reflected , he might have arrested him then , saved himself this long journey . But things were going to come out all right in the end . Silly to worry  --  they usually did . Soon he would be coming back along this same route , and Honywood would be with him . Perhaps the man 's confession would be in the detective 's pocket . Not a strong character , Honywood . Not the sort to hold out in the face of all Duff knew now . The next morning , at a little before ten , Duff 's taxi drew up before the gateway leading to the Hotel ExcelsiorGrand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found on the detailed itinerary left with him by Lofton . The Excelsior Grand was an enormous rambling affair , set high on a hill overlooking the city and the aquamarine sea , in the midst of extensive grounds . Duff noted orange and olive trees , with here and there a tall cypress , gloomy even under the gracious Riviera sun . The taxi man sounded his asthmatic horn , and after some delay a bell-boy appearedand took the detective 's bag . Duff followed the servant up the gravel walk that led to the hotel 's side entrance . Giant palms were overhead , and bordering the walk were beds of fragrant Parma violets . The first person the inspector saw when he entered the hotel lobby was the bearded Doctor Lofton . The second person he noted gave him a distinct shock . P104This was a Frenchman , also bearded , and as resplendentin gold lace and gorgeous uniform as the doorman of a Ritz hotel . The two men were in close converse , their beards almost touching , and Lofton looked worried . He glanced up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remarked , and a shadow crossed his face . " You made quick time . I scarcely expected you so soon . " " You expected me ? " Duff returned , puzzled . " Naturally . If you please , Monsieur le Commissaire . May I present Inspector Duff , of Scotland Yard , MonsieurHenrique ? " He turned to Duff . " This gentleman , as you have no doubt gathered from his uniform , is the local commissary of police . " The Frenchman rushed over to Duff and grasped his hand . " I am so happy for this meeting . Me , I am a fond admirer of Scotland Yard . I beg of you that you will not judge harshly in this case , Monsieur Duff . Consider if you will the stupidity with which we have been faced . Is the body left as it fell ? No . Is the pistol permitted to lie in peace where it was ? Not for a moment . All  --  all have touched it  --  the concierge , two bell-boys , a clerk  --  five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of finger-prints we are helpless . Is it possible that you can picture such stu-pidity " One moment , please , " Duff broke in . " A body ? A pistol ? " He turned to Lofton . " Tell me what has happened . " " You do n't know ? " Lofton asked . " Of course not . " " But I thought  --  however , it is too soon . I understandnow . You were already on your way . Well , P105Inspector , you arrive most opportunely . Poor Walter Honywood killed himself in the grounds of this hotel last night . " For a moment Duff said nothing . Walter Honywoodhad killed himself  --  while Scotland Yard moved forward to take him . A guilty conscience , no doubt . Killed Drake , and then himself . The case was over . But Duff felt no elation ; he felt instead an unpleasant sensation of being let down . This was too easy . Too easy altogether . " But did Monsieur Honywood finish himself ? " the commissary was saying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The finger-prints on the pistol  --  destroyed by the stupidity of the hotel employees , as I have related to you . True  --  it lay by his side , as though fallen from a dying hand . No one was seen near that vicinity . But even so , I welcome eagerly the opinion of a man from Scotland Yard . " " Yo'u have found no note of farewell ? No messageof any sort ? " " Alas , no . Last night we searched his apartment . To-day I am here to repeat the process . I should be overjoyed if you would be kind enough to join me . " " I 'll be with you in a moment , " Duff said , with an air of dismissal . The commissary bowed and retired . Duff turned at once to Doctor Lofton . " Please tell me all you know about this , " he directed . They sat down together on a sofa . " I gave the party only three days in Paris , " Lofton began . " Trying to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We arrived here yesterday morning . In the afternoon Honywood decided to drive over to Monte Carlo . He invited Mrs. Luce and Miss Pamela Potter to go with him . At six o'clock last evening I was here in the lobby talking with Fenwick  --  the prize pest of the tour , between you and me  --  when I saw Mrs. Luce and the girl enter that side door over there . I asked them about their drive , and they said they 'd enjoyed it immensely . Honywood , they told me , was out at the gate paying off the driver of the car  --  he would be in in a moment . They went on upstairs . Fenwick continued to pester me . There was the sound of a sharp report from outside , but I paid no attention . I thought it the exhaust of a car , or possibly a bursting tire  --  you know how they drive over here . In another moment Mrs. Luce came rushingfrom the lift . She 's the calmest of women ordinarily , and I was struck by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high excitement " " One moment , " Duff put in . " Have you told any of this to the commissary of police ? " " No . I thought it better to save it for you . " " Good . Go on . Mrs. Luce was upset " Extremely so . She hurried up to me . Has Mr. Honywood come in yet ? ' she demanded . I stared at her . Mrs. Luce  --  what has happened ? ' I cried . A great deal has happened , ' she replied . I must see Mr. Honywood at once . What can be keeping him ? ' The memory of that sharp report  --  like a shot , I realized it now  --  came back to me . I rushed out , followed by Mrs. Luce . We found the gardens in darkness , dusk had fallen , these economical French had not yet lighted the lamps . About half-way down the walk we came upon Walter Honywood , lying partly on the walk , partly on the floral border . He was shot unerringlyP107through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right hand . " " Suicide ? " said Duff , giving the doctor a searching look . " I believe so . " " You want to believe so . " " Naturally . It would be better --  " Lofton stopped . Mrs. Luce was standing just back of the sofa . " Suicide , your grandmother , " she remarked briskly . " Good morning , Inspector Duff . You 're wanted here . Murder again . " " Murder ? " Duff repeated . " Absolutely , " returned the old lady . " I 'll tell you in a moment why I think so . Oh , you need n't look so shocked , Doctor Lofton . Another member of your party has been killed , and what worries me is , will there be enough of us to supply the demand ? It 's still quite some distance around the world . " P108LOFTON was standing , and he began to pace J nervously back and forth over a patch of bright sunlight that lay on the Persian rug . He was chewing savagely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when perturbed . Mrs. Luce wished he would n't do it . " I ca n't believe it , " the conductor cried . " It 's incredible . One murder in the party I might admit  --  but not two . Unless some one is trying to wreck my business . Some one with a grudge against me . " " It seems more likely , " the old lady said dryly , " that some one has a grudge against the members of your party . As for your believing that this second affair is murder too , listen to what I have to say , and then tell me what you think . " She sat down on the sofa . " Come , " she went on , " draw up that chair and stop pacing . You remind me of a lion I used to see at the Hamburg Zoo  --  I got to know him quite well  --  but no matter . Inspector Duff , wo n't you sit here beside me ? I think you will both find my story interesting . " Duff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somehow , this was the type of woman who does n't have to speak twice . " Mr. Honywood , Miss Pamela and I drove to Monte Carlo yesterday afternoon , " Mrs. Luce continued . " Perhaps you already know that , Inspector . Mr. Honywood has been rather distraught and worried on this tour , but during our jaunt over to Monaco he seemed to relax  --  he was quite charming , really . More , I imagine , like his real self . He was not contemplat- FOG ON THE RIVIERA 109p109ing suicide  --  I am confident of that . There was a man once at the hill station of Darjeling , in India  --  it happenedI was the last person to see him alive  --  but I need n't go into it . Mr. Honywood was light-hearted , almost gay . He returned here at dusk last night still in that mood . We left him out at the gate paying off the driver of the car and , coming in , went to our rooms . " " I saw you , " Lofton reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I was unlocking my door , it came over me in a flash that the lock had been tampered with . Once , in Melbourne , Australia , my hotel room was entered  --  I 'd had experience , you see . The doors here have shrunk , the cracks are wide , and I saw about the lock the marks of some sharp instrument , probably a knife . A simple matter to force the spring . I went inside and turned on the light . Instantlymy impressions were verified . My room was in the utmost confusion , it had been searched from top to bottom . My trunk was broken open , and in a moment I made sure that what I had feared had happened . A document that had been entrusted to my keeping was missing . " " What sort of document ? " Duff inquired with interest . " We must go back to London , and the period followingthe murder of Hugh Drake . On the Saturdayfternoon just two days before our departure fromr city , Mr. Duff , I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once in the loungeBroome 's Hotel . I was puzzled , of course , but Id as he asked . He came into the room in whatmed a very perturbed state of mind . Mrs. Luce , ' said without preamble , I know you are a womanP110of wide experience and great discretion . Though I have no right to do so , I am going to ask a favor of you . ' He took a long white envelope from his pocket . I wish you to take charge of this envelope for me . Keep it well guarded , and if anything should happen to me on this tour , please open it and read the contents at once . ' " " And that is the document which was stolen ? " Duff demanded . " Let 's not get ahead of our story , " the old lady replied . " Naturally I was somewhat taken aback . I had n't said two words to him thus far on the tour . Mr. Honywood , ' I inquired , what is in this envelope ? ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he replied . Nothing save a list of instructions as to what must be done in case I  --  in case I am not here any more . ' Certainly Doctor Lofton is the person with whom this should be left , ' I told him . No , ' he said . Doctor Lofton is decidedly not the person to hold that envelope . ' " Well , I just sat there , wondering . I asked him what he thought was going to happen to him . He murmured something about being ill  --  one never could tell , he said . He looked so spent , so utterly weary , I felt sorry for him . We were all rather on edge . I knew that Mr. Honywood was supposed to be sufferingfrom a nervous breakdown , and I told myself that this was perhaps the whim of a sick and troubled mind . It seemed to me a small thing he was asking , and I told him I would take the envelope . He appeared to be delighted . It 's so good of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , if I were you . We had better not leave this room together . I will wait here until youp111have gone . And if you do n't mind , I suggest we keep as far apart as possible when we are with the other members of the tour . ' " All that was rather queer , too . But I had an engagementwith some friends in Belgravia that afternoon , and I was already late . I patted the poor man on the back , told him not to worry , and hurried out . When I got to my room , I glanced at the envelope . On it was written in a small script : To be opened in case of my death . Walter Honywood . ' I hastily locked it in my trunk , and went out . " " You should have communicated with me at once , " Duff reproved her . " Should I ? I could n't decide . As I say , I thought it the notion of a sick mind , and of no importance . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't until I got on the train for Dover on Monday morning that I really began to think about Mr. Honywoodand the document he had given into my care . For the first time I wondered if it could have any connection with the murder of Hugh Drake . When I walked on to the deck of the channel boat at Dover , I determined to find out . " I saw Mr. Honywood leaning against the starboard rail , and I went over and joined him . He seemed very reluctant to have me do so . All the while we talked he kept glancing up and down the deck with a sort of hunted and terrified look in his eyes . I was quite uncomfortable about the whole affair by this time . ' Mr. Honywood , ' I said , I have been thinking about that envelope you left with me . I feel the moment s arrived for a frank talk between us . Tell me  --    have you any reason to believe that your life is in danger ? ' " He started at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no , ' he stammered . Not at all . No more than any one 's life is in danger in this uncertain world . ' His reply did n't satisfy me . I decided to put into words a thought that had come to me in the train . If you should meet the same fate as Hugh Morris Drake , ' I said , would the name of your assailant be found insidethat envelope ? " " It seemed for a moment that he was n't going to answer me . Then he turned , and his eyes were so sad that again I pitied him . My dear lady , ' he remarked , why should you think I would put such a burden on you ? That envelope contains just what I said it did  --  instructions to be carried out in case of my death . ' If that is true , ' I answered , why was n't it left with Doctor Lofton ? Why must I guard it so carefully ? Why do you object to our being seen together ? ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm frightfully sorry I ca n't answer them . But I give you my word , Mrs. Luce  --  I am not letting you in for anything . Please  --  I beg of you  --  hold that envelope just a little longer , and say nothing . The matter will soon be settled . And now  --  if you do n't mind '  --  he was still looking up and down in that frightened , anxiousway  --  I do n't feel very well and I am going insideto lie down . ' Before I could say another word , he had gone . " Well , I went on to Paris , still worried . I 'm sorry to say I did n't believe what the poor man had told me . I thought that with my usual perspicacity I had hit upon the true situation . I was certain that WalterFOG ON THE RIVIERA 113p113Honywood expected to be murdered , just as Hugh Morris Drake was murdered , and by the same person . And I was almost as certain that he had written the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would make me a sort of accomplice in the Drake murder or something like it . I had no fear on that score . Once , in Japan , where I lived three years , I protected  --  oh , well , I had right on my side , there 's nothing more to be said . But in this case I did n't want to protect anybody . I wanted the man who had killed Drake discovered and punished . I was upset -- and I 'm not often upset . I did n't know what to do . " " There was just one thing to do , " remarked Duff sternly . " And I am disappointed in you that you did n't do it . You had my address " " Yes , I know . But I 'm not accustomed to calling in some mere man to help me solve my difficulties . There was one other thing to do , and I 'm disappointed in you that you have n't thought of it . Have you never heard of the old trick of opening an envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open that envelope ? " Duff cried . " I did , and I make no apologies . All 's fair in love d murder . That night in Paris I released the flap , d took out the sheet of paper the envelope contained . " " And what was on it ? " Duff asked eagerly . " Just what poor Mr. Honywood had told me was it . A brief note that ran something like this : " Dear Mrs. Luce : I am so sorry to have troubled  --  . Will you be kind enough to ask Doctor Lofton communicate at once with my wife , Miss Sybil Conway ? She is at the Palace Hotel , San Remo , Italy . ' "  | " Meaning precisely nothing , " Duff sighed . " Precisely , " agreed Mrs. Luce . " I felt rather small when I read it . And puzzled . I had never been so puzzled in all my seventy-two years . Why could n't he have left that message with the doctor ? There was no need of it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Honywood 's wife . A number of us did  --  he had mentioned her several times , and said that she was in San Remo . Yet here he had written this unnecessary bit of information on a slip of paper and given it to me , intimating that I must guard it with my life . " Duff stared thoughtfully into space . " I do n't get it , " he admitted , " Nor I , " said Mrs. Luce . " But can you wonder I believe Mr. Honywood was murdered ? I am sure he saw it coming  --  the look in his eyes . And the murderer thought it necessary to get possession of that slip of paper in my trunk before going on with his plans . Why ? Heaven knows . Who told him there was such a paper ? Did Walter Honywood ? It 's all too obscure for me . You must unravel it , Mr. Duff . I hand the whole matter over to you . " " Thanks , " answered Duff . He turned to Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honywood'swife was in San Remo ? " " I certainly did , " Lofton replied . " Honywood told me so himself . He asked me to stop over there a day , at the Palace Hotel , in the hope that he might persuade her to join our tour . " Duff frowned . " The fog increases , " he sighed . " You 've notified the lady , I presume ? " " Yes , I called her on the telephone last night , andP115when she heard my news , I believe she fainted . At least , it sounded that way  --  I heard her fall , and I lost the connection . This morning her maid telephoned me and said that Mrs. Honywood  --  or Sybil Conway , as she calls herself  --  was unable to come to Nice , and that she wanted me to bring her husband 's body to San Remo . " Duff considered . " I must have a talk with the lady at my earliest . Well , Doctor , now that we have heard Mrs. Luce 's story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What should I say ? I must admit that it begins to look like something more than a simple case of suicide . As a matter of fact , I shall have to tell you that my own room was searched repeatedly while we were in Paris . Yes , it was probably murder , Inspector  --  but can you think of any good reason why any one save the three of us here should know it ? If the French police find it out  --  well , you understand what red tape is over here , Mr. Duff . " " There 's a lot in what you say , Doctor , " Duff agreed . " I must admit I would n't care to have the Paris SureteCenter the case now  --  much as I respect their intelligence and their record . No , it 's my job , and I want to do it . " " Precisely , " said Lofton , with evident relief . " Considerthis , too . Shall we tell the remaining membersf the party what we suspect ? They 're a bit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , d this would certainly start him off again . Supsethe party broke up and scattered to the four winds ? mold that help your investigation ? Or would yourefer that we stick together until your case is solved ? " Duff smiled grimly . " You put it all most logicallyP116and convincingly , Doctor . If you 'll get your party together , I 'll have another chat with them , and then see what I can do with that commissary of police . I do n't believe he 'll prove difficult . " Lofton departed , and Duff stood staring after him . He looked down at Mrs. Luce . " Honywood thought Lofton was decidedly not the person to hold the envelope , " he remarked . She nodded vigorously . " He was very firm on that point , " she said . Pamela Potter and Mark Kennaway had entered the side door of the hotel . Duff nodded and waved to them . They came over at once . " Why , it 's Inspector Duff , " the girl cried , with every evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hello , Miss Pamela , " the detective said . " And Mr. Kennaway . Been out for a stroll ? " " Yes , " answered the girl . " We managed to evade the eagle-eyed chaperon and took a walk along the beach . It was heavenly  --  at least I thought it was . But I 'm given to understand that the air is nowhere near so invigorating as on the North Shore , in Massachusetts . " Kennaway shrugged . " I 'm afraid I 'm in wrong , " he remarked . " I ventured to say a good word for my native state , and I hear that in Detroit it is n't even regarded as a good market for automobiles . And how could we sink lower than that ? However , I do approveof Nice " Fine , " laughed the girl . " They wo n't have to tearit down just yet . Why  --  what 's wrong with Mr. Tait ? " The famous lawyer was approaching rapidly , his facep117a purplish red that boded ill for a man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , hello , Mr. Duff , " he began . " Where the devil have you been , Kennaway ? " The young man flushed at his tone . " I have been for a walk with Miss Pamela , " he said in a low voice . " Oh , you have , have you ? " Tait went on . " Leavingme to shift for myself . Did you think of that ? To tie my own necktie . " He indicated the polka-dot bow he affected . " Look at the damn ' thing . I never could tie them . " " I was n't aware , " Kennaway said , his voice rising , " that I was engaged as a valet . " " You know perfectly well what you were engaged for . To be my companion . If Miss Potter wants a companion , let her hire one " " That is a service , " began the young man hotly , " for which some people do not have to " Just a moment . " Pamela Potter stepped forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie , Mr. Tait . There . That 's better . Go look in a mirror and see . " Tait softened a bit  --  he could n't very well help it . But he continued to glare at the boy . Then lie started to walk away . " Pardon me , Mr. Tait , " Duff said . " The members of Doctor Lofton 's party are asked to meet in that parlor over thereTait wheeled . " What for ? More of your damned silly investigation , eh ? You may waste the time of the others , but not mine , sir , not mine . You 're a fumbler , Inspector , an incompetent fumbler  --  I saw that in London . Where did you get there ? Nowhere . To hell with your meetings . " He took a few stepsP118then turned and came back . His face was contrite . " I beg your pardon , Inspector . I 'm sorry . It 's my blood pressure  --  my nerves are all shot to pieces . I really did n't mean what I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I quite understand . In that parlor across the way , please . " " I will wait there , " Tait replied humbly . " Are you coming , Mark ? " The young man hesitated a second , then shrugged his shoulders and followed . Mrs. Luce and the girl accompanied him . Duff went to the desk of the hotel to register at last . He arranged with a bell-boy to take his bag above-stairs . As he turned away , he encountered Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Benbow . " Rather expected to see you , " Benbow said , after a genial greeting . " But you got here sooner than I thought you would . Too bad about Honywood , is n't it ? " " A great pity , " Duff agreed . " What do you think of that affair ? " " Do n't know what to think , " Benbow told him . " But  --  well , I guess I 'd better tell him , Nettie . " " Of course you 'd better tell him , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has anything to do with all this or not , " Benbow continued . " But one night Nettie and I went to one of those hot shows in Paris  --  boy , did I need my smoked glasses ?  --  and when we got back to the hotel , our room was a wreck . Every bit of baggage ripped open and searched , but not a thing taken . I did n't know what to make of it . Was n't Scotland Yard , was it ? " Duff smiled . " Hardly . Scotland Yard is not soFOG ON THE RIVIERA 119P119clumsy as that , Mr. Benbow . So your room was searched . Tell me  --  have you been seeing much of Mr. Honywood since you left London ? " " Well , yes  --  we have . His room was near ours , in Paris . I went around a little with him there . He knew the town like I know Akron . Say  --  do you believe he killed himself ? " " It looks that way , " Duff replied . " Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , " Benbow answered , and he and his wife walked to the room Duff had indicated . The detectivefollowed . As he crossed the threshold , the Minchinsappeared in his path . Maxy gave him a friendly greeting . " Well , another guy has been put on the spot , " the racketeer remarked , in a hoarse whisper . " Looks like they was something doing in this mob . What do you make of it , Officer ? " " What do you ? " Duff inquired . " Too deep for this baby , " Maxy assured him . " No , I do n't get it . But that guy Honywood did n't rub himself out , you can gamble your roll on that . I been watching . I see other birds get the news their number was up , and believe me , he had it . You could tell it from his eyes . Looked like he was praying to know which way the hot lead was coming from . " " Mr. Minchin , " Duff said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we discuss the affair here this morning , will you be good enough to keep that opinion to yourself ? " " I 'm wise , " Minchin replied . " It 's just like I told you  --  I trail along with the bulls this time . Sealed like a coffin  --  that 's my lips . "   Lofton arrived at that moment with Mrs. Spicer and Stuart Vivian . While they were finding chairs , Ross came limping in . He was followed by Keane , whose sly little eyes traveled everywhere about the room before he sat down . " All here but the Fenwicks , " Lofton remarked to Duff . " They seem to be out , and I did n't make much effort to find them . If we can get everything settled before that little fool shows up , so much the better . " Duff nodded , and faced the group . " Here I am again , " he began grimly . " I want to say a few words to you about your future plans , in view of last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Walter Honywood . " " Suicide ? " inquired Mrs. Spicer languidly . She looked very smart in a white frock , with a trim little hat pulled far down over her brilliant eyes . " Suicide is what I said , " Duff went on . " Has any one of you anything to tell me about the unfortunate occurrence ? " No one spoke . " Very good , " Duff continued . " In that case we will " Just a moment , " Vivian broke in . The scar on his forehead stood out with appalling clarity in that bright room . " Merely a little incident , Inspector . It may mean nothing . But Mr. Honywood and I came down here in the same sleeping compartment . I 'd got to know him rather well in Paris  --  I liked him . We went to the dining-car together for dinner . When we returned to our compartment , both of my bags had been broken into and obviously searched . Nothing belonging to Honywood had been touched . It seemed a bit odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , FOG ON THE RIVIERA 121P121after I had made my discovery . He was deathly pale , and trembling like a leaf . I asked him what was wrong , but he turned my questions aside . None the less , he was obviously alarmed  --  if that is a strong enough word . " " Thanks , " Duff said . " Interesting , but it does n't upset the suicide theory . " " You think , then , he committed suicide ? " Vivian asked , with just a faint note of incredulity . " That is what the French police believe , and I am inclined to agree with them , " Duff told him . " Mr. Honywood had suffered a nervous breakdown . His wife , of whom he appeared very fond , was estranged from him . The stage was all set for a tragedy of that sort . " " Perhaps it was , " Vivian replied , but there was a question in the words . " You have had a most distressing tour so far , " Duff continued . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . It is possible the secret of Mr. Drake 's  --  er  --  accident has died with Honywood . I may tell you that certain of my discoveries in London would indicate that it has . Better let them think so , anyhow . It might put the murderer off his guard . I should like to see you , as soon as the police investigationhere is finished , resume your tour . I feel sure that it will be without unpleasant incident from here on . Is there any reason why you Should n't ? " " None whatever , " said Mrs. Luce promptly . " I 'll on as long as there 's a tour . " " That 's the way we feel , lady , " Maxy Minchin added . " I knew you would , " Mrs. Luce assured him .   " Well , I do n't see any reason for stopping , " Captain Keane announced . " I could n't go back to Akron without the pictures I promised ' em , " Benbow remarked . " I 'd be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my order , and when I turn in an order , I want to see it filled . " " Mr. Ross ? " Duff inquired . The lumber man smiled . " By all means , " he said , " let 's go on with the tour . It 's taken me a long time to get started , and I 'd hate to drop it now . " " Mrs. Spicer ? " That lady took out a long holder , and inserted a cigarette . " I 'm no quitter , " she remarked . " Who 's got a match ? " Vivian leaped into action . It was evident he would follow where she led . " Who began all this , anyhow ? " Tait wanted to know . His temper appeared still uncertain . " No one has ever talked of stopping , except that little idiot Fenwick . Do I have to apologize ? No  --  he is n't here , is he ? " " Good , " Doctor Lofton said . " We shall leave here whenever the commissary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the time of the train later . Our next stop will be San Remo , over the border in Italy . " Amid a buzz of comment , the meeting broke up . Duff followed Mrs. Luce from the room . He stopped her beside the sofa where they had talked before . " By the way , " he remarked , " when you came back last night , and entered the lobby with Miss Pamela , I believe Lofton was here talking with Fenwick ? " " He was  --  yes . "   " When you hurried down again , after discovering the theft of that envelope , was Fenwick still with the doctor ? " " He was not . Doctor Lofton was alone . " " Lofton had asked you about Honywood when you came in ? " " Yes . He inquired about Mr. Honywood in a rather anxious way . " " Be careful . I do n't want editorial opinions , Mrs. Luce . I want facts . So far as you know , Lofton and Fenwick may have separated the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . And Doctor Lofton may have rushed outside and fired that " Never mind . " " But I do n't like the man either , " protested the old lady . " What do you mean by that word either ? " Duff inquire . " I do n't have likes and dislikes , Mrs. Luce . I ca n't afford to , in my business . " " Oh , I guess you 're human , like the rest of us , " said Mrs. Luce , and went on her way . Lofton came up . " Thank you , Inspector , " he remarked . " You settled our future plans in short order . If you can have an equal success with the commissary of police , all will be well . " " I fancy it will . By the way , Doctor Lofton  --  last might , when you heard that shot outside , were you still lking with Fenwick ? " " Yes , of course . I could n't shake the man . " " Do you think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I imagine he did . He started a bit . "   " Ah , yes . Then you and he both have a very good alibi . " Lofton smiled in a somewhat strained way . " I guess we have . Unfortunately , however , Mr. Fenwick is not here to verify what I say . " " What do you mean , he 's not here ? " Duff cried . " I did n't tell you in the parlor , " Lofton answered , " but this note has been found , pinned to the pillowcase in Fenwick 's room . You 'll notice it is addressed to me . " He handed it over . Duff read : " Dear Doctor Lofton : I warned you that if there was any more funny business , we 'd quit . Well , there has been more funny business , and we 're off . I 've arrangedit with the concierge , and we 're pulling out in a car at midnight . You ca n't stop us , and you know it . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rebate on the price of the tour waiting for me there when I get back . That means you had better get it off at once . " Norman Fenwick . " " Leaving at midnight , " mused Duff . " I wonder which way they went . " " The hotel people tell me Fenwick was asking about the boats from Genoa to New York . " " Genoa , eh ? Then they went east along the Riviera . They 're over the border by now . " Lofton nodded . " Undoubtedly . Over the border in Italy . " " You appear rather pleased , Doctor Lofton , " Duff remarked . " I 'm delighted , " the doctor returned . " Why should I try to conceal it ? In fifteen years of touring , IFOG ON THE RIVIERA 125p125never met a worse pest than Fenwick . I 'm glad he 's gone . " " Even though your alibi went with him ? " Duff suggested . Lofton smiled . " Why should I need an alibi ? " he inquired blandly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detectiveto ponder this somewhat disconcerting news . Two of his traveling group of suspects had broken away from the fold . Nothing had been discovered that connected the Fenwicks with the London murder in any way  --  or with that of Honywood either . None the less , Duff felt that every member of the Lofton party was under suspicion until the problem was solved , and the Fenwicks were not immune . The man did not look like a murderer , but experience had taught the inspectorthat few murderers do . He was exceedingly annoyed by the high-handed conduct of the pompous little chap from Pittsfield . Yet what could he do about it ? He had no authority to dictate the actions of any one in that party save Honywood  --  and Honywood was dead . A commotion about the lift attracted his attention , and the next moment the resplendent commissary of police was marching toward him . How well that dazzling uniform fitted into the colorful background of the Riviera . " Ah , Inspector , you do not arrive above , " the commissarycried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duff shook his head . " There was no need , Monsieur le Commissaire . I know only too well the keen eyes of the French police . May I congratulate you on your conduct of this case ? I have investigated , and I am struck by the intelligence you have shown . "   " That is so kind of you to say , " the commissary beamed . " Me , I have learned much that I know from a study of Scotland Yard methods . " His chest expanded . " Yes , I believe what you say is correct  --  I have done well here under the conditions . But what conditions ! Impossible even for the most brilliant mind . The stupidity of the servants  --  Monsieur , I could easily weep . Footprints trampled upon , fingerprintsdestroyed . What is it there remains I can do ? " " Fortunately , there is nothing more you need to do , " Duff assured him . " It is a case of suicide , Commissary . I can guarantee that . " The Frenchman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am most ' appy to hear . A woman  --  she is in it , of course ? " Duff smiled . " Yes , " he said , taking his cue neatly . " The dead man 's wife . He loved her passionately , and she deserted him . Heart-broken he tried to go on alone . It was no use . Even here in your charming and cheerful city , he perceived it was no use . Hence the pistol , the body on the walk . " The commissary shook his head . " Ah , the woman , Monsieur . Always the woman ! What suffering , what sorrow , is she not responsible for ? Yet  --  could we do without her ? " " Hardly , " ventured Duff . " Never ! " cried the commissary , with vehemence . ' I shudder to think " He paused . " But I fearWe get beside the point . The Doctor Lofton tells me why you are here , Inspector . I accept your word of the suicide . Who should know better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affair closes itself . "   " Very good , " Duff nodded . " Then I take it that the party may continue its tour at once ? " The commissary hesitated . After all , one must not treat the affair too lightly . " Not quite so fast , Monsieur , if you please , " he said . " I go now to the room of the Juge d'Instruction . With him rests the final decision . Presently I shall call you with the telephone and inform you what that is . The arrangement is satisfactory , Inspector ? " " Oh , quite , " Duff answered . " Once more , my heartiestcongratulations . " " You say too much , Monsieur . " " Not at all . I have been impressed  --  deeply im-pressed . " " How can I thank you ? How indicate my pleasure at this meeting ? " " Do not attempt it , Monsieur . " " Again I accept your advice . Bon jour , Inspector . " " Bon jour , " repeated Duff , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lofton came up to Duff at once . " Well ? " he inquired . The detective shrugged . " It will be all right , I fancy . The commissary was glad to be convinced . But he has to report the matter to the examining magistrate before a final decision can be made . I am to await a telephone call . I hope it comes soon , as I am eager to put through one myself for San Remo the moment I know what our plans are to be . " " I shall be somewhere in the hotel , " Lofton told him . " Naturally I want to hear about it as soon as you get the call . There 's a train de luxe at four-thirty this afternoon , and I hope very much we can be on it . " DUSK AT SAN REMO 129.  |p129An  hour passed before the word came through from the commissary that they could go on whenever they pleased . Duff hastily scribbled a note for Lofton , gave it to a bell-boy , and then stepped up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at San Remo on the telephone , " he said . " I wish to speak with Mrs. Walter Honywood  --  or Miss Sybil Conway , as she sometimes calls herself . " This , it appeared , was viewed by the staff as considerableof an undertaking . An excited discussion took place behind the scenes . Duff sat down in a near-by chair and waited . After many minutes a bellboycame to him breathless with news . " A lady in San Remo has the wire , " he said . The detective hastened into the booth ' that was pointed out to him . " Are you there ? " he cried . His deep distrust of Continental telephones moved him to shout at the top of his voice . An answering voice faint , far-away , but musical , Founded in his ear . " Did some one wish to speak to Miss Conway ? " " Yes  --  I did . Inspector Duff , of Scotland Yard . " " I can not hear you . Inspector what ? " " Duff . Duff . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't r you . " Duff was perspiring freely , and he suddenly realized at he had been bellowing . He spoke in a lower tone , d more distinctly . " I am Inspector Duff , of Scotland Yard . It hason my duty to investigate the murder of Mr. HughDrake , of the Lofton travel party , in London . I amin Nice , where I have happened upon the unfor- tunate death of your husband , Mr. Walter Honywood . " " Yes . " The voice was very faint . " Madam , I am deeply sorry . " " Thank you . What did you wish to say to me ? " " I am wondering if you know anything that may throw light on his death ? " " Doctor Lofton told me it was suicide . " " It was not suicide , Madam . " Duff 's voice was now very low . " Your husband was murdered . Are you still there ? " " I am here . " Very faintly . " I feel certain the murder has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duff went on . There was a pause . " I can assure you that it has , Inspector , " said the woman . " What 's that ? " Duff cried . " I am telling you that the two are connected . They are , in a manner of speaking , the same murder . " " Good lord , " the detective gasped . " What do you mean by that ? " " I will explain when I see you . The story is a long one . You will come to San Remo with the Lofton party ? " " I certainly will . We are leaving here at four-thirty this afternoon , and should reach your hotel about two hours later . " " Very well . The matter can wait until then . M r . Honywood wanted the whole affair kept quiet for my sake . I imagine he feared it would hurt my career in the theater , and that I 'd be distressed on that account . But I have made up my mind . I mean to see justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I know who murdered my husband . " DUSK AT SAN REMO 131P131Again Duff gasped . " You know who " I do , indeed . " " Then , for God 's sake , Madam , do n't let 's take any chances . Tell me now  --  at once . " " I can only tell you that it was a man who is travelingwith the Lofton party around the world . " " But his name  --  his name ! " " I do not know what he calls himself now . Years ago , when we met him in  --  in a far country , his name was Jim Everhard . Now he is traveling with the Loftonparty , but under another name . " " Who told you this ? " " My husband wrote it to me . " " But he did not write you the name ? " " No . " " Did this same man kill Hugh Morris Drake ? " Duff held his breath . It was Drake 's murderer he had to find . " Yes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? " " Yes  --  it is all in the letter , which I shall give you to-night . " " But this man  --  who is he  --  that is what I must disover , Madam . You say you met him years ago . Will on recognize him if you meet him again ? " " I shall recognize him instantly . " Duff took out a handkerchief and mopped his brow . This was magnificent . " Madam , are you still there ? Mrs. Honywood ? " " 1 am still here . " " What you have told me is  --  very satisfactory . " Of was always given to understatement . " I shall arrive at your hotel at about half past six this evening . I am not certain of the exact moment . With me will be the entire Lofton party . " A thought of Fenwickmashed through his mind , but he dismissed it . " There must be no accident . I beseech you to stay in your rooms until I communicate with you again . I shall arrange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a point where you yourself will remain unseen . When you have made your identification , the rest will lie with me . Everything will be made as easy for you as possible . " " You are very kind . I shall do my duty . I have made up my mind . At any cost to myself  --  and the cost will not be inconsiderable  --  I shall help you to bring Walter 's murderer to justice . You may rely on me . " I am relying on you , and I am eternally grateful . Until to-night , then , Mrs. Honywood . " " Until to-night . I shall be awaiting your call in my rooms . As Duff left the booth , he was startled to find Doctor Lofton standing just beside it . " I got your message , " Lofton remarked . " We 're booked for the four-thirty express . There 's a ticket for you , if you want it . " " Of course I want it , " Duff answered . " I 'll pay you for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk away , then paused . " Ah  --  er  --  you have talked with Mrs. Honywood ? " " I just finished . " " Could she tell you anything ? " " Nothing , " Duff replied . DUSK AT SAN REMO 133 " What a pity , " Lofton said casually , and moved on toward the lift . Duff went to his room as near to elation as he ever got . A difficult case- one of the most difficult he had ever been called upon to face  --  and another seven hours would solve it . As he sat in the dining-room at luncheon , he made a cautious study of the men in Lofton 's travel party . Which one ? Which one could smile and smile , and be a villain still ? Lofton himself ? Loftonwas traveling with the party . With , the woman had said , not in . Was that significant ? Possibly . Tait , who had experienced that terrific heart attack just as he entered the parlor at Broome 's Hotel ? Not out of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak heart , and still gather the strength to strangle another man of Drake 's advanced age . And Tait had about him the look of far countries . Kennaway ? A mere boy . Benbow ? Duff shook his head . Ross or Viviatror Keane ? All possible . Maxy Minchin ? He hardly seemed to fit into the setting , but the affair was quite in his line . Fenwick ? The detective 's heart sank . Suppose it were Fenwick  --  well , what of it ? he 'd go after him , even to the ends of the earth  --  to Pittsfield , Massachusetts , wherever that was  --  he 'd gofter Fenwick and bring him back . At four-thirty that afternoon they were all aboard e train de luxe , bound for San Remo . Duff had condedin no one , so he alone knew what was waiting cad . He went from one compartment to another , making sure once more  --  though he had counted them the station  --  that no one was missing . After chat  --  ng with a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennaway .   " Well , Mr. Tait , " he began amiably , dropping into a seat , " I trust that for your sake the exciting part of your tour around the world is now ended . " Tait gave him an unfriendly look . " You need n't worry about me , " he said . " How can I help it ? " Duff smiled . He sat for a moment in silence , staring out at the passing scene . Wooded hills and richly cultivated plains swept by , a tiny seaport with a chapel , a ruined castle . Beyond , the blue and sparkling Mediterranean . " Rather pretty country along here , " the detective ventured . " Looks like the movies , " growled Tait , and picked up a copy of the New York Herald 's Paris edition . Duff turned to the young man . " First trip abroad ? " he inquired . Kennaway shook his head . " No , I used to come over in college vacations . Had a grand time in those days  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man and sighed . " Nothing to worry me  --  nothing on my mind but my hair . " " This is different , " Duff suggested . " I 'll sign a statement to that effect any time , " smiled the boy . Duff turned back to the old man with an air of determination . " As I was saying , Mr. Tait , " he remarkedloudly , " how can I help worrying about you ? I saw one of your attacks , you may recall , and my word  --  I thought you were gone , I did indeed . " " I was n't gone , " Tait snapped . " Even you must have noticed that . " " Even I ? " Duff raised his eyebrows . " Quite true . I 'm not much of a detective , am I ? So many points I have n't solved . For example , I do n't yet know whatp135you saw inside Broome 's parlor that brought on such a severe heart attack . " " I saw nothing , I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the inspector went on blandly . " Have I asked you this before ? On the night Hugh Morris Drake was murdered , did you hear no sound  --  no cry  --  you know what I mean ? " " How should I ? Honywood 's room was between mine and Drake 's . " " Ah , yes . So it was . But you see , Mr. Tait "  --  the detective 's eyes were keen on the old man 's f ace  --  " Drake was murdered in Honywood 's room . " " What 's that ? " Kennaway cried . Tait said nothing , but the inspector thought his face had grown a trifle paler . " You understood what I said , Mr. Tait ? Drake was murdered in Honywood 's room . " The old man tossed down his newspaper . " Perhaps you 're . better detective than I thought you , " he remarked . " So you 've found that out , have you ? " " I have . And under the circumstances , do n't you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll tell you just what happened , " he said . " I presume you wo n't believe it , but thatwo n't matter a damn . Early on the morning ofFebruary seventh , I was awakened by the sounds of some sort of struggle going on in the room next tome at Broome 's Hotel . Honywood 's room , it was. he struggle was extremely brief , and by the time Ias fully awake , all indication of it had ceased . Ibated with myself what I should do . I 'd been try- , g for some months to rest , and the thought of belinginvolved in a matter that did not concern me was very distasteful . No thought of murder , of course , came into my mind . Some sort of trouble  --  yes  --  I sensed that . But everything was quiet by that time , and I determined to go back to sleep and forget it . " In the morning I rose at an early hour and decided to breakfast outside . After I 'd had my coffee  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I went for a walk in St. James 's Park . When I arrived back at Broome 's I met a servant at the Clarges Street entrance who told me that an American had been murdered up-stairs . He did n't know the name , but it came to me suddenly that I knew it . Honywood ! That struggle ! I had heard Honywood murdered and had made no move to help him , to apprehend his assailant . " I had already had one great shock , you see , when I came to you at the parlor door . I stepped across the threshold , certain that Honywood was dead upstairs . He was the first person I saw . That shock , added to the previous one , was too much . My heart went back on me . " " I see , " nodded Duff . " But you told me nothing of the struggle in Honywood 's room . Was that sporting of you ? " " Probably not . But when I saw you again , I was weak and ill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could . You had your job  --  you could do it . All I wanted was peace . That 's my story . Believe it or not , as you like . " Duff smiled . " I am rather inclined to believe it , Mr. Tait . Subject , of course , to what the future may reveal . " Tait 's look softened . " By Jove , " he remarked ,  --  you are a better detective than I thought you were .  --    " Thank you very much , " answered Duff . " I believe we are already at San Remo . " As the hotel bus rolled through the streets of the town in the dusk , Doctor Lofton spoke a few words to his charges . " We 're leaving here to-morrow noon , " he announced . " None of you will unpack any more than is absolutely necessary . You understand that we must go on to Genoa at the earliest possible moment . " Presently they drew up before the entrance of the Palace Hotel . Duff secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stairs leading up from the lobby . There was a lift of the Continental type not far from his door , he noted , as he made a study of his surroundings . Though not a man given to moments of excitement , his heart was beating at a quite surprising rate . The Palace was a comparatively small establishment , not one of the huge show places of the town , but even so there was an air of spaciousness and comfort about it . Dinner , the detective discovered , was only half an hour away . About the lobby and the corridors hung that atmosphere of quiet characteristic of a resort hotel when the guests are dressing for the evening . Duff had ascertained at the desk that Miss Sybil Conway  --  it was under that name she had registered  --  was on the fourth floor . His room , he was glad to discover , was equipped with a telephone . He called Miss Conway 's apartment , and in another moment the low musical voice , which must have been so pleasing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scotland Yard . " He halfwhisperedit . " I 'm so glad . The wait has been terrible . I -- I am ready to go through with it . "   " Good . We must meet at once . The members of the party are all in their rooms , but they will reappear in the lobby presently for dinner . While we are waiting for them , you and I will have a chat . " " Of course . I shall bring you a letter my husband wrote me from London . It will explain many things . And after that --  " After that , you and I will watch the members of Doctor Lofton 's travel party go in to dinner . I have selected our hiding-place , behind a cluster of palms . For our chat , I have planned it this way . There is a small deserted public parlor just beside my room on the first floor . You understand what I mean by the first floor  --  the one above the lobby  --  I believe you would call it the second in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside . I suggest we meet there . Is your apartment near the lift ? " " A few steps only . " " Splendid . You will come down in the lift -- Stopa bit . I have thought of a better way . I will come and fetch you . Number 40 , I believe  --  your room ? " " Number 40 , yes , I shall be waiting . " Duff went immediately into the hall . He was pleased to see that the corridor was in semi-darkness , illuminatedonly by such light as came up from below along the open elevator shaft . He pressed the lift button . Occasional visits to modest hotels in Paris had matte him familiar with the whims of the automatic Continentalelevator . The cage rose slowly and majestically  --  thank heaven , for once it was not out of order . Ile got in , and pressed another button , this time for the fourth floor . He knocked at the door of number 40 , and it wasP139opened by a tall graceful woman . A blaze of light at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once that she was beautiful . Her hair was gold , like her gown , and her voice , heard now over no telephone wire , thrilled even the stolid inspector . " Mr. Duff  --  I 'm so glad . " She was a little breathless . " Here  --  this is my husband 's letter . " He took it and put it in his pocket . " Thanks a thousand times , " he said . " Will you come with me ? The lift is waiting . " He ushered her into the narrow cage , then followed and pushed the button for the first floor . Slowly , hesitantly , the unsteady car began its descent . " I have been ill , " Sybil Conway told him . " I am finding it difficult to go on with this . But I must  --  I must " " Hush ! " admonished the detective . " Not now , please . " They were slipping past the third floor . " In a moment , you must tell me everything -- He stopped in horror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot . A small object hurtled through the air and fell at his feet . The woman 's face appalled him . He caught her in his arms , for he had seen , on the bodice of her gold silk gown , a spreading , dull red stain . " It 's all over , " Sybil Conway whispered . Duff could not speak . He reached out one hand and fought savagely with the locked door of the lift . The imperturbableinvention of the French moved resolutely on . A great bitterness was in the detective 's heart . This was a situation that would haunt Inspector Duff to the end of his career . He had seen a woman murdered at his side , had held her dying in his arms ,  |p140locked  with her in a little cage , the door of which would open all in good time . He looked aloft into the darkness and knew that it was no use . When the lift released him , he would be too late . It released him at the first floor . Doors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sybil Conway to a sofa in the parlor . She was dead , he knew . Running back to the lift , he picked up an object that was lying there . A small bag of wash leather  --  he did not need to open it . He knew what it contained . Pebbles gathered from some beach  --  a hundred silly , meaningless little stones .   A DUFF left the elevator he closed the door behind him , and almost instantly the bell rang and the cage began to ascend . He stood for a moment watchingit slowly rising , the only spot of light in that dark scene . Too late he noted what a target was presented by any one who stood on the unprotected platform . Like most foreign lifts it moved along a shaft which was , save for a sparse iron grill work , open on all sides . The platform was surrounded by a similar grill , no higher than the average passenger 's shoulder . What a shining mark that gold silk gown , how simple to kneel on the floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as the lift and its human freight passed slowly out of sight . It seemed so obvious now that ithad happened , but it was one of those things that no honest man , lacking in imagination , would ever see in advance . As he turned away , the inspector was muttering savagely beneath his breath . In his heart was an unwilling respect for his antagonist . The owner-manager of the Palace was puffing up the stairs . He was a man of enormous girth , innumerable yards of black frock coat encircled him . Mountains of spaghetti must have existed , ere he could be . After him came his clerk , also in a frock coat , but thin and with a chronically anxious look . The hallway was filled with excited guests . Quickly the detective led the two men into the parlor , and locked the door . They stood staring at the sofa and its pathetic burden .   As briefly as possible , Duff presented the situation . " Murdered in the lift ? Who would do that ? " The eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ? " replied Duff crisply . " I was with her at the time " Ah , you were ? Then you will remain here and talk with the police when they arrive . " " Of course I will . I am Inspector Duff , of Scotland Yard , and this dead woman was to have been an importantwitness in the matter of a murder which took place in London . " " It becomes clearer , " the big man nodded . " The poor , poor lady . But such things , you must know , are bad for my hotel . There is a doctor who lives here . " He turned to his clerk . " Vito -- you will fetch him at once . Though it is , I fear , too late . " He waddled to the door , unlocked it , and stood there facing the guests . As a screen , he was efficient . " A small accident , " he announced . " It concerns none of you . You will return to your rooms , if you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hurrying by him , the proprietor laid a hand on the clerk 's arm . " Call also the City Guards . Not , you understand , the Carabinieri . " He glanced at Duff . " They would bring I1 Duce himself into the affair , " he shrugged . The clerk dashed down the stairs . Inspector Duff started to leave the room , but the fat man blocked his way . " Where do you go , Signore ? " he demanded . " I want to make an investigation , " the detective explained . " I tell you I am from Scotland Yard . How many guests are at present in the hotel ? " " Last night there slept here one hundred and twenty , " P143the owner answered . " It is the season 's high point . Quite filled , Signore . " " One hundred and twenty , " Duff repeated grimly . A bit of work for the City Guards . A bit of work even for him , who knew that of this great group , only the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty he edged by the owner , and went aloft by way of the stairs . The third-floor hallwaywas silent and deserted ; he found no sign of any sort about the lift shaft . If ever there was a murder without a clue , he reflected , this was no doubt one . Dejectedly he went on up and knocked at the door of room 40 . A white-faced maid opened to him . Briefly he related what had happened . The woman seemed quite overcome . " She feared this , sir . All afternoon she has been worried . If anything happens to me , Tina , ' she said , over and over , and she gave me directions what I must do . " " What was that ? " " I was to take her body back to the States , sir . And that of poor Mr. Honywood as well . There are cables I must send , too . To friends in New York . " " And relatives , perhaps ? " " I never heard her speak of any relatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite alone . " " Really ? Later , you must give me a list of those to whom you are cabling . Now you had better go down to the parlor on the first floor . Tell the managerwho you are . They will no doubt bring your mistress back here presently . I will stop in the rooms a moment . "   " You are Inspector Duff ? " " I am . " " My poor mistress spoke of you . Many times in the past few hours . " The maid disappeared , and Duff passed through a small entrance hall into a pleasant sitting-room . The letter Sybil Conway had given him burned in his pocket , demanding to be read , but first he wanted to search these rooms . In a moment the Italian police would arrive and he would be too late . He went to work with speed and system . Letters from American friends  --  not many  --  telling nothing . Drawer after drawer  --  the open trunks  --  he hurried on . At last he was conscious , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that some one was watching from the doorway . He swung about . A major of the City Guards was standing there , an expression of surprise and displeasure on his dark face . " You search the rooms , Signore ? " he inquired . " Let me introduce myself , " said Duff hastily . " I am Inspector Duff , of Scotland Yard . The British consul will vouch for me . " " From Scotland Yard ? " The policeman was impressed . " I begin to understand . It was you who was with the lady when she was killed ? " " Yes , " nodded Duff uncomfortably . " I did find myself in that unpleasant position . If you 'll sit down " " I prefer to stand . " Naturally , in that uniform , Duff thought . " As you please , " he went on . " I want to tell you sonicthingof this affair . " As briefly as he could , he outlinedthe case on which he was engaged , and explainedP145Sybil Conway 's role in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian police to know , he was none too explicit . Especially was he careful to say nothing of Lofton 's Round the World Tour . The Italian listened with unruffled calm . When Duff had finished , he nodded slowly . " Thank you very much . I assume you will not leave San Remo without communicating with me ? " " Well , hardly . " Duff smiled grimly , thinking of the innumerable times he had made a similar remark to other men . " What did you find in your search of these rooms , Inspector ? " " Nothing , " said the Scotland Yard man quickly . " Not a thing . " His heart beat a little faster . Suppose this policeman , annoyed at his interference , ordered him searched , found Honywood 's letter ? For a moment they stared at each other . It was an international crisis . But Duff 's appearance of stolid respectability won out . The Italian bowed . " I shall have the honor of meeting you later , " he said . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Withoutdelay he meant to read the letter Sybil Conway had handed him a few moments before her death . He locked his door , drew a chair up beneath a feeble light , and took out the already opened envelope . It bore in the upper left corner the crest of Broome 's Hotel , London , and it was postmarked February fifteenth . Eight days after the murder of Hugh Drake , the detective reflected , and only a short time before the Lofton party started for the Continent . He removed the bulky contents of the envelope .   Walter Honywood wrote an unusually small hand , but even so this message to his wife covered many pages . With eager anticipation , Duff began to read : " Dearest Sybil : " You will see from the letter-head that I have now reached London on that tour around the world which , as I wrote you from New York , the doctors advised . It was to have been a rest for me , a release , a period of relaxation . Instead it has turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tour ! " I found this out on the morning of February seventh , a little more than a week ago . Found it out under the most frightful circumstances . Under circumstancesso bizarre , so horrible  --  but wait . " When I went aboard the boat in New York , even the names of the other members of the party were unknown to me . I had not so much as met the conductor . We were called together on the deck for a moment before sailing , and I shook hands with all of them . I did not recognize Jim Everhard . Why should I ? I saw him , you will remember , only the once and the light was poor  --  a dim oil lamp in that little parlor of yours . So many years ago . Yes , I shook hands with them all  --  with Jim Everhard  --  the man who had sworn to kill me  --  and to kill you , too . And I never suspected  --  never dreamed " Well , we sailed . It proved a rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for a few brief strolls on the deck after dark , until the morning we reached Southampton . We came on here to London , and still I had no inkling . There was much sightseeing ( luring the first few days , but I kept out of it . That was not what I had come abroad for  --  and London was an old story , anyhow .   " On the night of February sixth I was sitting in the parlor of Broome 's Hotel when another member of the party came in . A fine old fellow from Detroit , named Hugh Morris Drake , the kindest man alive , and very deaf . We got into conversation . I told him about my illness , and added that I had got very little sleep for the past few nights , owing to the fact that some one was reading aloud in the room on one side of me until a late hour . I said I was reluctant to go up-stairs to bed , because I knew I could not rest . " At that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , owing to his deafness , the sort of thing that was troubling me would mean nothing to him , and he offered to change rooms with me for the night . It developed that he had the room on the other side of me , so it seemed a simple matter to arrange . I acceptedMr . Drake 's offer gratefully . We went upstairs . It was agreed we would leave all our possessionsjust as they were , unlock the door between the rooms and merely change beds . I closed the connectingdoor between us and retired  --  in Mr. Drake 's bed . " The doctor had given me a package of sleeping powders to use as a last resort , and as an added guarantee of sleep , I had taken one of those . In the unaccustomed silence , and with the aid of the powder , I slept as I had n't slept in months . But I was awake at six-thirty , and inasmuch as Mr. Drake had told me he wanted to rise early  --  we were expecting to leave for Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I entered and looked about me . His clothes were on a chair , his ear-phone on a table ; all the doors and windows were closed . I went over to the bed to wake him . He had been strangled with a luggage strap . Ile was dead . " At first I did n't understand  --  early morning , only half-awake  --  you see how it was . Then , on the bed , P148I saw a little wash leather bag . You remember , my dear ? One of those bags we gave Jim Everhardtherewere two , were n't there ? Am I wrong , or were there two wash leather bags , with the pebbles inside ? " I sat down and thought the matter out . It was simple enough . Jim Everhard was somewhere in Broome 's Hotel . He had located me with the tour  --  he had made up his mind to carry out his old threat at last  --  he had stolen into my room to strangle me in the night and return the bag of stones . Into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hugh Morris Drake was in my bed in that dark corner where the light of the street lamps never penetrated . And Hugh Morris Drake had died ; died because of his kindness to me ; died  --  if you like irony  --  because he was deaf . " It was horrible . But I knew I must pull myself together . There was nothing I could do for Drake . I would gladly have given my life to prevent what had happened  --  too late now . I must get through the thing somehow  --  I wanted to see you again  --  to hear your voice  --  I love you , my dear . I loved you from the moment I saw you . If I had n't , all this would never have been . But I do n't regret it . I never shall . " I decided that I could n't leave poor Drake there in my bed , among my things . How explain that ? So I carried him to his own room and put him in his bed . There was the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what to do with it . It would mean nothing to any one  --  save to Jim Everhard  --  and to us . I tossed it down on the bed beside Mr. Drake . I almost smiled as I did so  --  smiled at the thought of Everhard carrying it all those years , and leaving it at last in the wrong place , wreaking his vengeance on the wrong man .  --  Of course , he still has that other bag . " I unlocked my door into the hall , then slipped backP 149into Drake 's bedroom and locked the door between the rooms on his side . The ear-phone caught my attention ; I had been forced to move it , so I wiped it clean of finger-prints . Lucky I thought of that . Then I went from his room into the hall , springing his lock behind me , and so to my own room again . No one saw me . But I remembered a waiter who had brought up a cable for Drake the night before , and who knew about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , I rang for him and bribed him . It was easy . Then I sat down to wait for the breakfast hour  --  another day . My meeting with Jim Everhard . " I saw him . I knew him this time  --  the eyes  --  there is something about a man 's eyes that never changes through the years . I was sitting in a parlor of the hotel waiting for the Scotland Yard inspector , and I looked up . He was standing there . Jim Everhard , with another name now . And traveling with the party , too . " While the Scotland Yard man was asking questions , I tried to think what I had better do . I could n't very well drop out of the party  --  I was already in a bad position . My nerves  --  I had n't stood the questioning very well . If I dropped out , they might arrest me at once . The whole unhappy story might be revealed . No , for the present I must go on , travel side by side with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever to kill me  --  who had , in fact , already killed me , after a manner of speaking . " I decided that it must be done . For a week I slept every night with a bureau against my door  --  or tried to sleep . Gradually I evolved a scheme for my protection . I would go to Everhard , tell him I had left in a safe place a sealed envelope , to be opened in case anything happened to me . In that envelope , I would give him to understand was written his name  --  the name of my murderer , if murder had occurred .   That , I thought , would stay his hand , for a time at least . " I prepared such an envelope . But in the brief note inside I did not mention Everhard 's name . Even if it happens  --  even if he gets me in the end  --  the old story must not come out . The old scandal . It would ruin your fine career , my dear . I could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I left the envelope only this afternoon with a member of the party I am certain no one would ever suspect of having it . A few moments ago I saw Jim Everhard in the lobby . I went and sat beside him , and in the most casual way , as though I were discussing the weather , I told him what I had done . He did n't speak . He just sat there looking at me . I told him of the envelope , with his name inside . The last part was n't true , of course , but I think my plan will serve its purpose . " So I am coming on with the party , as far as Nice . I am sure he will do nothing before we reach there . The whole affair appears to have shaken him badly  --  as well it might . The first night our party is in Nice , I propose to slip away in a car in the dark , to come to San Remo and get you . Scotland Yard has given up the chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop me in any case . We shall hide until the threat has passed . I am taking it for granted that in the face of this unexpected danger , our differences are buried . " No , my dear  --  I am not going to tell you the name under which Jim Everhard travels with our party . You were always so impulsive , so quick to act . I am afraid if you knew it , and something happened to me , you could not remain silent . You would throw away your splendid career with one grand gesture , expose the whole situation  --  and no doubt live to regret bitterly what you had done . If something should happen to me , for God 's sake get out of the path of the Lofton party at once . Disappear from San Remo  --  your own safetyP 151must be your first thought . Motor to Genoa and take the first boat for New York . For my sake  --  I beseech you . Do n't spoil the remaining years of your life  --  what good would it do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But nothing will happen to me . You have only to keep calm , as I am doing . My hand is quite steady as I write this . Everything will come right in the end , I am sure . I shall wire you the date ; be ready for me when I come . We 'll go away for a second honeymoon . Everhard and the events of the long ago will fade back into the shadows where they have remained so many years . " With all my love , forever , " Walter . " Gravely Inspector Duff folded the letter and put it back into its envelope . An acute feeling of helplessness stole over him . Again he had been so close to knowing , again the hotly desired knowledge had been snatched away at the last moment . The news that the murder of Hugh Morris Drake had been pure accident did not greatly surprise him . He had suspected as much these past few days . But accident or not , its perpetrator must be seized and brought to justice . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triple murderer  --  had seemed on the very point of Honywood 's pen . Then  --  nothing . What name ? Tait  --  Kennaway  --  Vivian ? Lofton or Ross ? Minchin , Benbow or Keane ? Or perhaps even Fenwick . But no , Fenwick was no longer with the party . He could hardly have been concerned in this murder tonight . Well , he would know in the end , Duff thought .   Know , or after that scene in the elevator feel eternally disgraced . With his lips set in a firm line that betokeneddetermination , he locked the letter securely away in his bag , and went down-stairs . Doctor Lofton was the only person in the lobby at the moment . He came to Duff at once , and the inspector was struck by his appearance . His face was white beneath his beard , his eyes staring . " My God , what 's this ? " he demanded . " Honywood 's wife , " answered Duff calmly . " Murderedby my side in the lift . Just as she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of Honywood . Point him out to me  --  in your party . " " In my party , " Lofton repeated . " Yes , I believe it now . All along I 've been telling myself  --  it could n't be true . " He shrugged his shoulders despairingly . " Why go on ? " he added . " This is the end . " Duff gripped him firmly by the arm . People were coming out of the dining-room , and the detective led the way to a far corner . " Of course you 're going on , " he insisted . " My word  --  you wo n't be the one to fail me , I hope . Listen to me  --  it was n't a member of your party who was killed this time  --  you need tell your crowd little or nothing about the affair . I 'm keeping you entirely out of the local investigation . Your people will perhaps be questioned  --  but along with all the other guests in the house . There is n't a chance these Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stumped . In a day or two you 'll go on  --  go on as though nothing had happened . Do you hear me ? " " I hear you . But so much has happened . " " Only a few of us know how much . You will goP153on , and the murderer in your party will begin to think himself safe . He has finished his work now . Resume your tour , and leave the rest to me  --  and the Yard . Do you understand that ? " Lofton nodded . " I understand . I 'll go , if you say so . But this last affair seemed almost too much . I was badly shaken for a moment . " " Naturally you were , " answered Duff , and left him . As he sat down to dinner at a table just inside the dining-room door , the detective was thinking hard . For the first time , Lofton spoke of giving up the tour . At this moment  --  when the killer 's work was finished . The inspector was busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stopped beside his table . " By the way , " she said , " I 've news for you . Mr. Kennaway and I went for a stroll soon after we got here  --  Mr. Tait was taking a nap . Just as we were leaving the hotel , a car drew up and waited . Something told mE- to stop a minute  --  just to see who it was waiting for . " " Ah , yes , " smiled Duff . " And whom was it waiting for ? " " I get you , " she nodded . " But there are finer things in life than who and whom  --  do n't you think so , too ? The car was waiting for some old friends of ours . They came hurriedly out of this very hotel , with all their baggage . The Fenwicks , I mean . " Duff 's bushy eyebrows rose . " The Fenwicks ? " " None other . They seemed surprised to see Mr. Kennaway and me . Said they thought we were n't due here until to-morrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual changes . " " What time was this ? " the inspector inquired  | " A few minutes past seven . I know , because it was just seven when Mr. Kennaway and I met in the lobby . " " A few minutes past seven , " Duff repeated thoughtfully . The girl went on to join Mrs. Luce at a distant table , and Duff sat down again to his soup . It had been just six-forty-five , he reflected , when that shot was fired into the lift . P155LL through the entree  --  and it was really a pity , for a mind divided can not truly appreciate a chef 's masterpiece of the evening  --  Duff debated with himself over the Fenwicks . Should he look up that Italian policeman and suggest that the pair be apprehendedand brought back to San Remo ? The matter could be easily accomplished  --  but what then ? There was absolutely no evidence against Norman Fenwick . To call attention to him would be to involve the Lofton travel party  --  a thing which Duff certainly did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast chicken , he would make no mention to the Italian police of that somewhat precipitate departure . When he saw the major of the City Guards again , Duff was glad he had decided not to complicate that gentleman 's troubled existence with Fenwicks . Though the Italian had seemed serene enough during the interviewin Miss Conway 's suite , such a state of mind had evidently not long endured . As he got farther along with the case , the poor man had begun to realize the true nature of the situation which faced him , and now he was temperamental and Latin in the extreme . A murder without a clue , without a finger-print or a footprint , with no weapon to be examined , no witness save Duff , who was from Scotland Yard and so , obviously , above suspicion . A hundred and twenty guests and thirty-nine servants in the house when the shot was fired . It was no wonder that the distracted policeman155 raged about , asking useless questions , and gradually drifted into a state of nervous excitement that led him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his opponent was a small and emotional bell-boy who knew nothing whatever about it . At ten o'clock that night Duff came upon Pamela Potter and Kennaway seated in wicker chairs on the hotel terrace . " Heavenly spot for a chat , " the detectiveremarked , sitting down beside them . " Yes , is n't it ? " said Kennaway . " Note the oversize moon , and the scent of orange blossoms drifting up from the grounds . We were just wondering if these were included in the rate , or if they 'd be among the extras on our bills . Lofton 's contract , you know . Not responsible for personal expenses such as mineral waters , wines and laundry . Moonlight and orange blossoms usually turn out to be rated a personal ex-pense . " " I 'm sorry to interrupt your romantic speculations , " Duff smiled . " Miss Potter has told me that the two of you took a stroll just before dinner ? " Kennaway nodded . " We were trying to build up an appetite , " he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind for a while , life seems just one long table d'hote . " " When you told Mr. Tait you were going out did he offer any opposition to the plan ? " " No , he did n't . As a matter of fact , he acted rather in favor of it . He said he did n't care to dine before eight , as he was very tired , and wanted to lie down for a while before eating . Our rooms are quite small , and possibly he figured I might disturb him if I stuck around . " THE GENOA EXPRESS 157 " On what floor are your rooms ? " " On the third floor . " " Are you near the lift ? " " Just opposite it . " " Ah , yes . At six-forty-five this evening , I believe you had not yet left the hotel .. Did you hear the sound of a shot about that time ? " " I did . " " Where were you at the moment ? " " I was down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to meet until seven , but Mr. Tait had sort of shooed me out . " " Who else was in the lobby ? Any other member of the party ? " " No . Just myself and a few servants . I heard the shot , but I did n't realize what it was right away . You see , it came from the elevator shaft . Having ridden on the elevator , I was n't surprised . I was expecting to see It blow up in a cloud of red smoke at any moment . " " Then when the shot was fired , Mr. Tait was alone in your suite ? " " Undoubtedly . Alone , and probably sound asleep . " Probably , " nodded Duff . At that instant , Tait appeared on the terrace . He stood there straight and tall , a handsome figure in eveningdress under the Riviera moon . Duff had been thinking of him as an old man , but it suddenly occurredto the inspector that Tait was not so old as he seemed  --  illness , anxiety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I 'd find you here , " the lawyer remarked to Kennaway .   " Sit down , Mr. Tait , " Duff suggested . " We 've been admiring the view . " " I 'm fed up on views , " Tait snapped . " Wish I was back in New York . Active all my life , and this loafing is hell . " Duff wondered . Was Tait thinking of droppingout of the party too ? " Come on , Mark , let 's go up-stairs , " the lawyer went on . " I want to get to bed . You wo n't have to read to me very long to-night . " " Still mystery stories ? " the detective inquired . " Not a chance , " Tait answered . " There 's enough murder in real life without reading about it in books . We 've taken up the Russians now . It was Mark 's idea . He thought he was clever , but I 'm on to him . I have to listen or go to sleep , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the ladies . " He turned and walked toward the lighted French window through which he had come . " Are you ready , Mark ? " he said ; over his shoulder . Kennaway rose reluctantly . " When duty calls with clarion voice , the youth replies , I come , " he remarked . " Sorry , Miss Potter . Mark Kennaway signing off . If the orange blossoms are an extra , you 'll have to bear the expense alone from now on . " " Nice chap , is n't he ? " Duff inquired , as the young man disappeared . " Very nice , " answered the girl . " At times . Tonightwas one of the times . " " What do you mean , at times ? " the detective inquired . " Oh , he has his moments . At others , he looks at me as much as to say , how in the world did I ever come to speak to this person from the crude MiddleTHE GENOA EXPRESS 159p159West ? It 's Boston , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm afraid not , " Duff replied . " Tell me  --  how are the members of the travel party taking our latest murder ? " " Calmly enough , I believe . I 've always heard that one gets used to anything in time . I presume we 'll be held up here for a while ? " " It 's hard to say , " Duff told her . " A murder investigationin Italy , you know , is likely to be a complicatedaffair . There are three branches of the police , the City Guards , the Carabinieri and the Municipal Force . The last are concerned only with minor crimes , but often the other two branches are called upon simultaneously to investigate a murder , and the result is a very pretty little row between them . So far , only the City Guards have come into this case , and I am hoping the Carabinieri stay out . If they do , I do n't anticipate much difficulty . I believe I can convince that worried major that this is my affair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl leaned suddenly closer . " Tell me something , please ? " she said gravely . " Is the murderer the same person every time ? My grandfather , poor Mr. Honywood , and now Mrs. Honywood ? All killed by the same man ? " Duff nodded slowly . " Undoubtedly , Miss Pamela . The same man . " " Who ? " Her voice was low , tense . " Who ? " The detective smiled . " All in good time , we know , " he replied . " I am quoting an old friend -- a Chinese whom I want you to meet when you reach Honolulu . At present moment we are faced by stone wall . We swing about , seeking new path . Still quoting my friend . " The girl did not speak . After a brief silence Duff continued . " I looked you up to-night because I have something to tell you , Miss Pamela . A part of our mystery at least has been solved . I have in my bag a letter which fully explains how your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl leaped to her feet . " You have ! I must see it . " " Of course . " Duff also rose . " If you will come up with me I will give it to you . Take it to your own room and read it . I should like to have it back in the morning . " Without a word , she went with him into the brightly lighted lobby . They moved toward the lift . Duff regarded the little cage with marked distaste . " I 'm on the first floor , " he suggested hopefully . " Then we wo n't bother with that thing , " said the girl . " Let 's walk . " She waited in his doorway while he brought the letter . He was frantically searching his mind for words of preparation and of sympathy , but none came to him . Words were not his forte . All he could say was : " At what hour shall we meet to-morrow ? " " At eight o'clock , " the girl answered . " In the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Duff returned below-stairs , where he had another chat with the baffled major of the City Guards . Subtly he planted in that official 's mind the uselessness of further investigation . This particular murder , he pointed out , looked to be solution-proof , but fortunately it happened to be one of a series , and since the first had taken place in London , the whole matter was up to THE GENOA EXPRESS 161p161Scotland Yard . He intimated that the Yard stood ready to relieve the Italian police of a difficult and thankless task . The major intimated that the Italian police stood ready to be relieved . When they parted , the local man seemed to be in a much happier frame of mind . The next day proved to be the type which the Riviera does so well -- deep blue sky , sparkling sea , and sunlight like a gold piece just from the mint . At eight o'clock , as they had planned , Duff met Pamela Potter in the lobby . The beauty of the morning was seemingly lost on the girl . Her violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She handed the letter back to Duff . " I wanted to prepare you , " he told her . " But I did n't know how . My methods are rather clumsy  --  I 'm so sorry . " " Not at all , " she answered in a low voice . " You took the very best course . Poor grandfather  --  dead for no reason whatever . Dead because he did another man a kindness . " " Who could ask a better epitaph ? " the detective said gently . Pamela Potter looked at him , and her fine eyes flashed . " Well , this does n't end the matter with me , " she cried . " I want that man  --  that man who killed him . I sha n't rest until he 's been found . " " Nor I , " Duff replied . He thought of the lift . " No , by gad  --  nor I. I mean to run down Jim Everhard if it 's the last act of my life . Have you any idea --  " She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking . Who of the men in our party ? They all Deem incapable of such a thing  --  even Maxy Minchin.  | Who  --  who ? Mr. Vivian  --  he appears to be interested only in Mrs. Spicer . Captain Keane  --  such a sneaky air  --  I do n't like him , but that 's not enough , of course . Mr. Tait  --  he 's very disagreeable at times . But then , the poor man is ill . Mr. Ross  --  there 's not a thing to connect him with all this . As for Mr. Benbow , I 'm sure he 'd never do anything he could n't photographand show the boys back in Akron . There 's DoctorLofton left . And that foolish little Fenwick man . But it would be absurd to think that he --  " Nothing is absurd in this business , " Duff broke in . " And by the way  --  you 've forgotten one member of the party . " " Really ? " She appeared surprised . " Who ? Or should it be whom ? I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was referring to Mark Kennaway . " She smiled . " Oh , do n't be ridiculous . " " I never overlook any one myself , " he remarked . " And since I am about to take you in as my part-ner --  " What do you mean by that ? " " I mean that I shall probably leave the party for a time . I do n't expect any more  --  er  --  accidents , and there is little I could accomplish if I came along . As I told you last night , I am faced with stone wall , and I must swing about , seeking another path . Sooner or later I shall no doubt join you again . In the meantime , I should like to have you act as my representative . Please make a study of the men in this group , and write me occasionally from the various ports where your tour touches . Just tell me how things are going . If you come across anything that looks like a clue , let me haveTHE GENOA EXPRESS 163p163it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that sort of thing , I 'm sure . And a cable if anything important turns up  --  New Scotland Yard , London , will reach me . Will you do that ? " " Of course , " the girl nodded . " I 'm writing to some twenty boys already . The more the merrier . " " I 'm flattered to be included on the list , " Duff replied . " Thank you so much . " Mrs. Luce came tip . " Oh , there you are , Pamela , " she said . " I 'm glad to see you in such safe company . Oh , do n't look at me like that , Inspector . Where matters of the heart are concerned , I presume you 're just as dangerous as any man . There  --  I 've probably made you very happy by saying that . " Duff laughed . " Gorgeous morning , is n't it ? " he inquired . " Is it ? " she answered . " I 'm from southern Californiamyself , and I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear , " the girl remarked pleasantly . " I always sleep well  --  provided I change bedrooms often enough . Even a murder does n't disturb me . I remember once at Maiden 's Hotel , in Delhi  --  of course , he was only a bus boy  --  the victim , I mean . But I must save that for my reminiscences . What have you made of last night 's affair , Inspector ? " " Nothing , as usual , " Duff replied grimly . " Well , I 'm not surprised . You 're no superman , and this friend of ours with the urge to kill begins to look like one . Clever , certainly . One reassuring thing  --  he 's starting to operate outside the party . There may be enough of us to last him , after all . Are you breakfasting , Pamela ? "   " I 'm famished , " said the girl , and followed Mrs. Luce into the dining-room . By noon it was apparent that the Italian authorities would attempt to hold none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean industry along the Riviera di Ponente , and not to be disturbed to satisfy a policeman 's whim . Bags were piled up at the door of the hotel , and a number of guests departed . The word went around among the Lofton party that they were to take the two o'clock express for Genoa . All of them were eager to he off . Lofton himself had recovered from his despairing mood of the night before ; he was everywhere at once , spreading information and advice . As for the major of the City Guards , his spirits had risen noticeably . After a talk with his associates , and a telegram to Rome , it had been decided to hand the whole matter over to Scotland Yard , which left the major nothing to do but wear his uniform and impress the ladies . At both of these tasks he excelled , and he knew it . Again , as on that morning in London , Inspector Duff found himself in the odd position of saying good-by to a group of people among whom was undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing them off on a long journey  --  Naples , Alexandria , Bombay , the far ports of the Orient . But by this time he was resigned to any turn which fate might take . With a cheery air he went with them to the station on the west bay , just outside the new town . They gathered on the platform to await the train . Benbow with his camera , Sadie Minchin loaded down with recent purchases in the jewelry line . " MaybeTHE GENOA EXPRESS 165p165Maxy wo n't have to come across when he meets a customs man , " she predicted proudly . Suddenly Mrs. Spicer gave a little cry . " Good heavens  --  I never realized it before , " she exclaimed . " What is the trouble ? " Doctor Lofton asked solicitously . " There are thirteen of us , " she replied , with a stricken look . Maxy Minchin patted her on the back . " Do n't mean a thing , lady , " he assured her . Doctor Lofton smiled wearily . " There are only twelve in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not in it , really , you know . " " Oh , yes , you are , " the woman persisted . " And you 're the thirteenth . " " Nonsense , Irene , " Stuart Vivian said . " Surely you 're not superstitious ? " " Why not ? Everybody is . " " Only the ignorant , " he replied . " Oh  --  I'msorry --  " He was sorry a bit too late . The woman had given him a look . Even those at whom it was not directed were startled to see it . There was a dangerous fire in her green eyes . " I 'm superstitious too , " Mrs. Luce put in diplomatically . " Not about thirteen , though . That 's always been lucky for me . But when it comes to a black cat  --  one crossed before my rickshaw on the Bubbling Well Road in Shanghai ten years ago , and half an hour later an automobile struck us . I pulled through all right , but I always blamed the cat . Thirteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady had walked haughtily away . P166The express thundered in , crowded as usual , and there began a hurried search for seats in the first-class compartments . Duff helped Mrs. Luce and Pamela Potter to find places . Once more he spoke to the girl about the letters . " Do n't worry , " she smiled . " I 'm positively garrulouswith a fountain pen . " The detective leaped back to the platform . Doors were slamming shut , one by one the Lofton travel party was disappearing from his ken . He noted Benbow , his camera hanging from a black strap across his shoulder , climbing into a compartment from which his wife had beckoned ; noted Ross with his Malacca stick helped aboard by a porter , caught a last knowing smile from Captain Keane . The final face he saw was that of Patrick Tait , the lined , worried face of a man old before his time , white as death now in the dazzling Riviera sunshine . " Well , that 's that , " shrugged Duff , and returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one he sat in the superintendent'soffice at Scotland Yard . His face was very red and he was perspiring freely , for he had just related the latter part of his story  --  the disturbing incident of the murder in the lift . His superior looked at him in a kindly , way . " Do n't take it too hard , my boy . It might have happened to any of us . " " I shall take it just this hard , sir , " Duff replied . " I shall go on searching for Jim Everhard until I find him . It may take months , but I mean to have him in the end . " " Naturally , " the superintendent nodded . " I knowTHE GENOA EXPRESS 167p167how you feel . . And every facility of the Yard will be put at your disposal . But do n't forget this . Evidence in the matter of the killing of Honywood and his wife is of no value to us . Those cases could never be tried in London . No  --  it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must capture Everhardand bring him here to answer for that , and our proofs must be unanswerable . " " I understand that , sir . It was why I did n't linger on in Nice or San Remo . " " Have you mapped out any future course of action ? " " No , I have n't . I thought I would consult with you about that . " " Precisely . " The superintendent nodded his completeapproval . " Will you please leave with me all your notes on the case ? I shall look them over duringthe day . If you will come in at five this afternoon , we will decide at that time what we had better do . And once more  --  do n't worry about that affair in the lift . Think of it only as a stronger incentive to get your man . " " Thank you , sir . " Feeling much better than when he had entered the room , Duff left it . A good egg , his superior . He lunched with Hayley , who was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to his superior 's office . " Hello , " that gentleman said . " Sit down , please . I 've read your notes . A puzzle , of course . But I was struck by one thing . No doubt you were , too . " " What was that ? " " This man Tait , Mr. Duff . " " Ah , yes  --  Tait . "   " Rather queer , my boy , rather queer . His story may be absolutely true , but doubts crept into my mind as I read . He thought Honywood had been murdered , he entered that parlor and saw Honywood alive , and the shock nearly finished him . Why should he take it so hard ? Honywood and he were , it seems , practically strangers . Why should the matter have been such a shock , unless " The superintendent paused . " I quite understand , sir , " Duff said . " Unless he supposed Honywood dead because he thought he himself had strangled the man in the night . Unless  --  in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " nodded the superintendent . " It is a matter to think about . Now , with regard to the future . As far as the travel party is concerned I believe , Mr. Duff , that for the time being your usefulness in that quarter is ended . " The inspector 's face fell . " Do n't misunderstand me , my boy . I merely feel that you are too well known among them to accomplish anythingthere . I have looked over the itinerary Lofton gave you . After Egypt , I note four boat trips  --  on a P. and O. liner from Port Said to Bombay , on a British India Steam Navigation Company ship from Calcutta to Rangoon and Singapore , then by way of another P. and O. boat from the latter place via Saigon to Hongkong . From Hongkong they are to take a Dollar liner bound for San Francisco . For the present I would leave the party in peace . Our quarry may think we have dropped the matter and be off his guard . In a few days I intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in touch with the party from that point on , in any manner that offers . I have n't definitely decided , but I am thinking of sending SergeantWelby . " THE GENOA EXPRESS 169 " One of the cleverest , Welby is , sir , " Duff replied , " Yes  --  and the type who could easily pass as a ship 's steward , or something of the sort . Cheer up , my boy . If Welby hits on anything definite , you shall join him and make the arrest . In the meantime , there is work to be done in the States . An investigation of the Honywoods ' past  --  the meaning of those wash leather bags  --  the search for a safety deposit box with the number 3260 . All that will be left to you . But there is no need for you to be off just yet . I want you to time your investigation in America so that you can conclude it on the west coast about the date when Lofton 's travel party lands at San Francisco . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . But may I make one suggestion ? " " Of course . What is it ? " " I should like to meet the party at Honolulu , sir . " " And why at Honolulu ? " " It " would give me that last run from Honolulu to the mainland , sir . Some of them may leave the party at San Francisco . And furthermore " Yes ? " " I have a very good friend at Honolulu . A chap of whom I 'm particularly fond . I believe I 've spoken to you about him  --  Inspector Chan , of the Honolulu police . " The superintendent nodded . " Ah , yes . Charlie Chan  --  the Bruce case . Do you think Inspector Chan would like to see you , Duff ? " Duff was puzzled . " I 'm sure he would , sir . Why do you ask ? " His superior smiled . " Because I have long wanted to do a favor for Mr. Chan . Do n't worry , my boy . 1 lonolulu can undoubtedly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless waiting . He busied himself with minor tasks , but his heart was elsewhere . Welby was off on a P. and O. boat , his destination Calcutta . For several nights Duff had coached him , read aloud from his notes , speculatedwith him over the possibilities in the Lofton travel party . Sergeant Welby , he realized with mixed emotions , was a remarkably clever lad . Not , like most of the C. I. D. men , from some inland farm , but a London product , a little cockney born within sound of Bow-bells . Within sound of those bells most of his days had been passed , and the seven seas were to him an uncharted emptiness . He had never even read about them ; he was having some difficulties with his geographynow ; but he faced the future with cool unconcern and unbounded confidence . He examined again and again the little bags of pebbles ; they seemed to fascinatehim . They formed , he said , the essential clue . He trembled to be off . Well , he was off now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had watched the cheerful face of his fellow detective until it faded from sight . Walkingthat same night across Vauxhall Bridge , with the tide out and the tang of salt sharp in the air , the inspectorthought of Welby , some miles out at sea by this time on his great adventure . Would Welby solve the puzzle  --  the puzzle that was by all rights the special task of Duff ? He would try to be broad-minded . HeP171had wished Welby luck , and by gad , he meant it . In a little more than two weeks came the first news of the Lofton party . It was contained in a letter from Pamela Potter , postmarked at Aden . The inspector opened it and read : " Dear Inspector Duff : " I 'm so sorry . I meant to send in my first report from Port Said . But the days are so full and the nights are so wonderful  --  well , we just drift along . I 'm afraid you 'd be feeling a bit impatient if you were with us . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've done all the bazaars , we 've met the Sphinx  --  I did remember to ask her that question we so want answered , but she did n't reply . " I 've seen Port Said . It may be as wicked as it 's reputedto be , but Mrs. Luce would n't let me find out . She said she 'd tell me all about it  --  and she did . Yes , she 's as full of reminiscences as ever . You need an atlas of the world when she talks to you . But she 's an old clear . " We 've put the Suez Canal behind us . Like a muddy river , with lonely people sitting at the stations beside the locks . I wanted to get off and tell them about Maurice Chevalier in. the talkies . On each side , oceans of sand dotted with scrub acacias , and at night the nice light air of the desert blowing across the ship . We 're nearly out of the Red Sea now , and the way I feel is , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The flying fish flopped on to the deck with a sort of pleasedto-meet-youair . The sun is a huge red ball when we watch it go down every night , and we listen to hear : t sizzle when it hits the water . At least I do . Mark Kennaway says it never touches the water at all , and that the sound I hear is eggs frying in the crow's-nest . " Faithful to my orders , I 've been cultivating the men in the party . The only result up to date is that I 've got myself heartily disliked by the women . Even Sadie Minchin thinks I 'm trying to steal her Maxy . Maybe I have overplayed Maxy a bit  --  but he 's quite amusing . I 've posed for Elmer Benbow so many times , I expect to see his wife take his camera away from him at any moment . As for the rest , well , I really believe I 've got over big with Stuart Vivian . " You remember that nice little row between Stuart and his lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They did n't speak for days  --  that is , she did n't , and after a while he gave up trying . It was then I came into his life . I got to thinking we did n't know much about him , so I set to work . When the gentle Irene saw the speed I was making , she rose in her wrath and took him back . I 'm not so sure he wanted to be taken . He squirmed considerably . A conceited man . As though I meant anything by my deep interest in his past . He 's forty-five , if a day . " All of which brings me  --  do n't ask me how  --  to dear Captain Keane . I was going to my stateroom the other night at twelve  --  I 'd been sitting up on deck with somebody or other  --  a man , I believe it was . I 'm trying to follow out your instructions to the letter , you see . Well , when I entered the alleyway  --  that 's authenticand nautical  --  leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Vivian 's door . He muttered something and hurried away . Still up to his old tricks , you will note . He 's one of the slyest men I 've ever met , but I 'm afraid he 's too obvious to mean anything , are n't you ? " As for the rest , I 've listened to Doctor Lofton 's erudite talks , to Mr. Ross on the subject of Tacoma and why does anybody live in the Middle West now that the Pacific coast has been discovered , until my ears ache . There 's Mr. Tait , too  --  my one failure . P173Somehow , my charms seem to fall on barren ground when he is about . How would you explain it ? Perhapshe 's a bit miffed because I take up a little of Mark Kennaway 's time . Did I say a little ? Maybe that is n't quite accurate . You see , he is so young , and I am so beautiful But as I was saying , I 've cultivatedthem all . And so far , I must admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't call that about Keane a clue . Would you ? " We have nearly reached Aden . Mrs. Luce is takingme to luncheon there , at her favorite restaurant . Probably she will call the head waiter by his first name , and ask after all the little waiters . Aden , she tells me , is a melting-pot that somebody put on the stove and forgot to remove . According to her , I shall get my first smell of the East when we reach there . I believe I 've had a whiff or two already . I do n't much like it . But Mrs. Luce claims you grow to love it in time . That when you 're sitting in your patio at Pasadena you suddenly remember it , and then it 's just a case of engaginga caretaker and locking the front door . Maybe . No doubt I shall be able to tell you more about that when I write again . " Sadie Minchin has just stopped at my elbow , wondering about the jewelry shops in Aden . Maxy had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Francisco dock . He owns a limousine with bullet-proof glass  --  perhaps he 'll have that there . " Sorry I have n't proved more of a detective . Better luck from here on . I 'll have lots of time in the Indian Ocean . " Sincerely yours " Pamela Potter . " That night , in the Vine Street station in London , Duff discussed this letter with Hayley . There wasn'tp174much to discuss , as they both realized . Duff was inclined to he impatient . " First time in my life , " he muttered , " that I ever depended on a girl to keep me abreast of a case . And the last , I hope . " " A charming girl , at any rate , " Hayley smiled . " What of that ? She 's not so charming that one of those men will suddenly turn to her and say : Oh , by the way , I murdered your grandfather . ' And that 's all I want . Not charm , but the identity of Jim Ever-hard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vine Street man . " Not for ages , " sighed Duff . " There they are , just drifting along , with no one watching them but a girl . A big idea of the chief 's . " " It will all come right in the end , " Hayley answered . " Something tells me . " " Please ask your something to come and talk to me , " said Duff . " I need it . " He needed it even more before he heard again . Every night he studied the itinerary Lofton had given him . In his thoughts he followed the little party across the Indian Ocean to Bombay , then by the long route  --  they would take the long route  --  to Mt . Abu , Delhi , Agra , Lucknow , Benares , Calcutta . It was while they were at Calcutta that he heard once more  --  a mysterious cable from the girl . " If one of your men is in this neighborhood , have him get in touch with me at once . At the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then aboard BritishIndialiner Malaya bound for Rangoon , Penang , Singapure . P175Feeling an unaccustomed thrill of anticipation , Duff cabled Welby in care of certain British agents in Calcutta . Then  --  silence again . One dreary clay succeedinganother , and not an atom of news . Confound the girl  --  did n't she realize that he , too , had a sleep interest in this affair , wanted to know what was happening ? He heard at last . A letter came in , postmarked Rangoon . Eagerly the man in London tore it open : " Dear Inspector Duff : " I am rather a dud as a correspondent , are n't I ? No doubt my cable left you in a little fever , and the explanationhas been slow in coming . But the mails , Inspector  --  you really must blame it on the mails . I could n't very well cable the contents of this letter . Spies , you know , in this mysterious East  --  spies back of every tamarind tree . " Let me see  --  where was I ? We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steaming after we got-there , and all the way across the Indian Ocean to Bombay . Tempers began to get a little frayed about the edges . You know , a party of this sort starts ouf as one great , big , happy family . It was a bit delayed in our case by certain events at the beginning , but the peak of comradeship and mutual love and esteem was reached in Italy and Egypt . Every one was very confidential . Then gradually , as the weather got hotter , our ardor for one another began to cool . It 's got so now that nobody enters a room without a preliminarysurvey to make sure no other member of the party , thank God , is inside . " Well , we did the Indian Ocean . We came into Bombay , said good-by to the dear old ship , and staggeredup to the Taj Mahal Hotel . And who do you think was in the lobby ? Mr. Fenwick , and his silent sister , from Pittsfield , Massachusetts . It seems that after they left us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on a world tour , so why not go through with it ? In Naples , it appears , they signed on for a cruise  --  you know , one of the big wonder ships that goes right on around without a change . At least , that 's what they told us , and as we 'd seen such a ship in the harbor , I presume it was the truth . Little Norman was insufferable . He asked us if we 'd had any more murders , and gave us a long talk on the superiority of their method of travel over ours . We were so happy to see a comparatively new face  --  even one like Mr. Fenwick 's  --  that we listened meekly . " We stayed in Bombay a couple of days , and then set out over the hills and far away in the direction of Calcutta . I got a good look at the Taj Mahal , and a terrible cold . Eventually we reached our destination , feeling a little sad about India and rather wishing there was n't any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come at last to my long delayed story of the cable . " On our final morning in Calcutta , Doctor Lofton herded us into a jewelry shop on Chowringhee Road . I presume he gets a commission on sales , he was so passionate about having us go there . Imri Ismail , I believe , was the proprietor 's name . Once I got inside , I was glad I 'd come . Really , the most gorgeous jewels you ever saw in your life  --  star sapphires , rubies , diamonds  --  but of course you 're not interested . Sadie Minchin went haywire on the spot . Even Maxy turned a bit pale to see her buying . " Most of the others in the party just looked casually around and then drifted out . But I happened to see a necklace of diamonds , and my will-power certainly failed me . A little weathered clerk with a drooping eyelid and a most villainous expression saw the conditionI was in , and fastened himself on me . WhileP177I was hovering on the brink , Stuart Vivian came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he knew a little about diamonds , and that these were good stones , but not worth what my pirate friend was asking . After a bitter argument , the price began to drop amazingly , until finally Mr. Vivian said it was a good buy . At that point Irene Spicer swept down on him , evidently after a long search , and carried him off . " It was while the clerk was removing the fictional price tag from the necklace that a surprising thing happened . Another clerk came along behind him , and as my man pressed close to the counter to let the other pass , he said something in a foreign tongue . Right in the middle of that string of strange sounds , two Englishwords stood out like a house afire . He said Jim Everhard ' as clearly and distinctly as a radio announcer . " My heart stood still . The other man paused , as though he were idly curious , and looked toward the door . No one was there . I had to get busy at once with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said casually to the man with the drooping eyelid : You know Jim Everhard , too ? ' That was where I made my big mistake . I should have said it before he got his hands on the checks . Now it was all a closed incident as far as he was concerned . He calmly pretendedhe did n't understand English any longer , and bowed me out . " I went for a walk in the Maidan and wondered what to do . I thought maybe I 'd send you a postcard with the message : Wish you were here . ' I certainly wished it . Then I evolved the brilliant idea of the cable . " I did n't hear anything all day . Mr. Kennaway and I went for a stroll in the Eden Gardens that afternoon , and then rode down to Diamond Harbor to get the British-India boat . We were quite late , and everybody else was aboard . As we started up the gang-plank , which they were about to draw in , who should come rushing down it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been aboard to see somebody off . Who ? Jim Everhard ? Or was this merely a last minute effort to make a few more sales ? " Late that night I was walking along the deck of the Malaya when a steward stopped me and told me some one in the second class wanted to see me . I was startled at first , then I remembered my cable , and so I followed the steward down a ladder to the lower deck . In the shadow of a life boat I met the queerest little man . I was a bit dubious about him at first , but he was all right . He was your friend , Mr. Welby , of the C. I. D. I liked him . He was cute . And such a quaint cockney accent . " I told him what had happened in the jewelry shop , and he was naturally interested . When I added that I had seen the clerk leaving the ship a few hours ago , he nodded . He said that he had been up in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the stewards , and that the man from Imri Ismail'shad attracted his attention . He had followed him and noticed which cabin he visited . And ; added Mr. Welby , it was a cabin occupied by two members of the Lofton travel party , Miss Potter . ' " Of course I wanted to know which two . Did I find out ? You know better . Mr. Welby just thanked me heartily for my information . You may have lightened my job considerably , ' he said . Then he asked me how much Stuart Vivian seemed to know about diamonds . I said I could n't tell , but that like all men he claimed to know everything about everything . Mr. Welby nodded again , and intimated that I could run along now . He told me he was hoping to obtain a position as steward on the Dollar boat out of Hongkong , and that in the meantime he would be hoveringP179about , but that I must n't speak to him unless he spoke first . I assured him I was always the perfect lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen him since . " Well , there you are , Inspector . That 's the situationon this hot April night in Rangoon , where our boat lays over two days . Speaking of the smell of the East , I know all about it now . The odor of fetid narrow streets , vegetables rotting in the tropic sun , dead fish , copra , mosquito lotions  --  and of too many people trying to be in one place at one time . I 'm used to it . I can look forward to China and Japan with an unconquerablenose . " I 'll probably write again from Singapore  --  it will depend on what happens next . Please pardon this long letter , but I told you I was garrulous with a fountain pen . And I really had something to write about this time . " Warmly yours  --  it 's the climate  --  " Pamela Potter . " An hour after reading this epistle , Inspector Duff was in conference with his chief . The superintendent read it too , and with an interest almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing a lone game , " he remarked , and his tone suggested a certain lack of approval . " He probably has nothing definite to report as yet , sir , " Duff replied . " But if the girl has narrowed his search to one of two people , then there ought to be news very soon . Of course , it may all come to nothing . She may even be mistaken about what she heard in the jeweler 's shop , " The superintendent considered . " Why did WelbyP180ask her how much Vivian knew about diamonds ? " he said at last . " Could n't say , sir , " Duff answered . " He 's deep , Welby is . No doubt he has a theory of some sort . We might cable to Calcutta and have that clerk questionedabout Jim Everhard . " His superior shook his head . " No  --  I prefer to leave it to Welby . To do what you suggest might interfere with his game . A cable of warning from the clerk to Everhard , and Everhard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain we should get nothing from Miss Potter 's friend with the drooping eyelid . He does n't sound like the sort who would be eager to assist Scotland Yard . " Duff had taken out a pocket calendar . " I figure that the Lofton party is in Hongkong to-day , sir . They 're to stop at that port a week , I believe , making a side trip to Canton . If I 'm to carry through the investigation you suggested , and then get on to Honolulu " He waited . " You want to be off , I suppose , " the superintendent smiled . " How soon can you start ? " " To-night  --  if there 's a boat , sir , " Duff answered . " To-morrow , at any rate , " agreed his superior . On the morrow Duff , radiantly happy that the moment for action had arrived at last , set out for Southampton . This time it was Hayley who sped the parting traveler , with many expressions of encouragementand hope . That night the inspector was aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of the screw was music in his ears ; he stood at the starboard rail and watched the prow of the ship as it cut with amazing speed through the dark water . I-Iisp181heart was light . Every moment was carrying him nearer the puzzle that had so ruddy left him to travel round the world . His inquiries into the past of the Honywoods , which he pursued diligently once he had reached New York , got him nowhere . They had arrived in that confusingcity some fifteen years ago , and none of the friends whose names Mrs. Honywood 's maid had given him appeared to know whence they had come . It was not , it appeared , customary to inquire , in New York . Todaywas all that mattered , yesterday was nobody 's business . Blank looks met any mention of the wash leather bags . Duff found himself baffled , and somewhatresentful toward this teeming , heedless city . In the matter of a safety-deposit box numbered 3260 , he was equally helpless . With the aid of the New York police , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his bank , and also that of the one kept by Lofton . Neither meant anything . A helpful cornmissionerpointed out to the Britisher that a man might have any number of secret boxes at banks where he did not regularly do business . This part of it , Duff began to realize , was nothing but a wild goose chase . Nevertheless he plodded on , patient to the end . He went to Boston and looked up Mark Kennaway 's positionthere . An excellent family , he discovered , and even he , an outsider , sensed what that meant  --  in Boston . Next he visited Pittsfield , where the continued absence of the Fenwicks was deplored by a little circle of the best people . Painfully respectable , it seemed , the Fenwicks . At Akron the air was less rarified , but the situation appeared much the same . Duff was taken out to lunch by Benbow 's partner , who told him to tell old Elmer to hurry home . Business , it was rumored , had definitely turned the corner , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends of Maxy Minchin reticent in the extreme . Tight-lipped , they listened to the inspector and had nothing at all to say . Duff gathered that there was no great public demand for the gangster 's return . He moved on to Tacoma . John Ross , he found , was an important figure in the lumber trade . Dropping down to San Francisco , he made inquiriesabout Stuart Vivian . The man was known to many of the leading citizens ; they all spoke highly of him . A call at the office of Irene Spicer 's husband revealed that he was away in Hollywood , and was not expected back for some time . Sitting down one mild May evening in his room at the Fairmont Hotel , Duff summed up the results of his long trek . They were nil . He had looked into the home standing of every man in the Lofton travel party , and with the exception of Maxy Minchin , all appeared to be above reproach . As for Maxy , it seemed unlikelythat he could be involved in any such affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was true he had found no track of Keane in New York , where the captain claimed to reside . The name was in no directory . But Duff gave this little thought . From the first , for some reason he could n't quite define , he had refused to suspect Keane . With that one exception , then , he was familiar with the home environment of all of them , and he was no nearer than ever to knowing which one was capable of murder . Yet there was a murderer in that group  --  there must be , if Honywood 's letter spoke true . " JimP183Everhard is traveling with the party . Jim Everhard , who has sworn to kill me  --  and you , too . " Duff got up and walked to the window . From his lofty perch he saw the lights of Chinatown , of the ferries in the harbor , of the tall buildings across the bay . Memories of his previous visit to this fascinating city came back to him . Memories of Charlie Chan . A bell-boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was from his chief at the Yard . " Cable from Kobe . Welby anticipates early success . Proceed to Honolulu . Luck . " A few words only , but Duff was mightily cheered . Welby , at least , was making progress . Would the little cockney solve the problem in the end ? Not usually an imaginative man , Duff was able none the less to picture a gratifying scene . A meeting with Welby on the Honolulu dock , Welby with proofs such as would satisfy the most exacting jury , Welby pointing out some not quite  --  at this moment  --  clearly discerned figure . " Tyke him , Duff . He 's guilty as hell . " Not quite so gratifying , of course , as it would have been if Duff had gathered those proofs himself . But what of that ? Scotland Yard always worked as a team . He would do something for Welby some day . The next morning but one , Duff sailed for Honolulu on the Maui . It would bring him , he knew , into Honoluluharbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the Aloha Tower . A brief time to renew old acquaintance with Charlie Chan , to tell him about this new case on which he had been working  --  and then , the Lofton travel party and action . Quick action , he hoped . He had decided not to cable Charlie of his coming . Why take the edge off the sur-prise ? For two days Duff loafed about the ship , at peace with the world . A glorious rest , this was . When the big moment arrived , he would be strong and ready . On the evening of the second day , a boy came up to him and handed him a radiogram . Tearing open the envelope , he glanced at the signature . The message was from his chief . " Welby found murdered on dock at Yokohama shortly after sailing of liner carrying Lofton party . Get Everhard dead or alive . " Crushing the message savagely in his hand , Duff sat for a long time staring into the darkness beyond the rail of the ship . Before his eyes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , smiling , confident , serene . The little cockney who had never hitherto strayed beyond the sound of the bells of St. Mary le Bow , killed on a Yokohama dock . " Dead or alive , " said Duff through his teeth . " Dead , if I have my way . "   A FEW mornings later , in the police court on the second floor of Halekaua Hale at the foot of Bethel Street in Honolulu , three men were on trial  --  a Portuguese , a Korean and a Filipino . They were charged with gambling in the street , and on the witnessstandat the moment sat a placid and serene Chinese . The East , we are told , has a deep respect for obesity ; in China as a mandarin increases in weight , he gains in prestige ; in Japan the wrestlers , heroes of the crowd , are enormous . The Oriental in the witness-box was equipped , on this count , for high standing among his own . " All right , Inspector Chan , " said the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The- witness sat , immobile as a stone Buddha . He opened his narrow black eyes a trifle wider , and spoke . " I am walking down Pawaa Alley , " he remarked . " With me is my fellow detective , Mr. Kashimo . Beforeus , at the door of Timo 's fish shop , we perceive extensive crowd has gathered . We accelerate our speed . As we approach , crowd melts gradually away , and next moment we come upon these three men , now prisoners in the dock . They are bent on to knees , and they disportthemselves with dice . Endearing remarks toward these same dice issue from their lips in three languages . " " Conte , come , Charlie , " said the prosecuting attorney , a red-haired , aggressive man . " I beg your pardon  --  Inspector Chan . Your language is , as usual , a little flowery for an American court . These men were shoot- ing craps . That 's what you mean to say , is n't it ? " " I am very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are familiar with the game ? You know it when you see it ? " " As a child knows its mother 's face . " " And you identify these men absolutely ? They are the crap shooters ? " No question whatever , " Charlie nodded . " They are , unfortunately for them , the three . " The lawyer for the defense , a slick little Japanese , was instantly on his feet . " Now I object , " he cried . " Your Honor , I question propriety of that word unfortunately . ' The witness speaks as though my clients had already been tried and found guilty . Mr. Chan , kindly restrain such comment , if you will do so . " Chan bowed his head . " Overwhelmed with chagrin , 1 am sure , " he replied . " Pardon me for assuming inevitablehas already occurred . " The lawyer gave a little cry of rebuke , but Charlie went blandly on . " To continue testimony , next moment the three look up and behold myself and the redoubtable Kashimo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling change . They leap up to feet to accomplish escape . Down the alley they race , myself after them . Before end of alley occurs , I have them . " The lawyer for the defense gave Charlie a hard look . He pointed to the three lean men , his clients . " Is it your purpose to tell the court that your avoirdupoisconquered those thin legs ? " he demanded . Chan smiled . " He who runs with a light conscience makes the most speed , " he answered gently . " Meantime , how does Kashimo occupy himself ? " inquired the lawyer. p 187 " Kashimo knows his duty , and performs it . He remains behind to gather up abandoned dice . Such was the proper move . " Chan nodded with grave approval . " Yes , yes , " broke in the judge , a bald-headed man with an air of infinite boredom . " And where are the dice ? " " Your Honor , " Charlie answered , " unless I am much mistaken , the dice have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active Mr. Kashimo . " Kashimo had indeed come in . He was a nervous little Japanese , and at sight of the bleak look on his face , Charlie 's heart sank . Stepping hastily inside the enclosure , the Japanese whispered excitedly into Charlie 's ear . Presently Chan looked up . " I was much mistaken , your Honor , " he said . " Mr. Kashimo has lost the dice . " A roar of laughter swept through the room , while the judge idly hammered on his desk . Charlie sat motionless and seemingly undisturbed , but his heart was bitter . Like all Orientals , he did not relish laughter at his own expense , and much of this was no doubtdirected at him . As a matter of fact , he was now in a ridiculous position . The lawyer for the defense , grinningbroadly , addressed the court . " Your Honor , I move charge be dismissed . There is no material evidence . Even famous Inspector Chan will tell you there is no material evidence , when he regainscomposure and speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a grim look at the slant-eyed little attorney , " would much prefer to make oration on efficiency of Japanese race . " " That will do , " cut in the judge . " Once more the time of this court has been wasted . Charge is dismissed . Call the next case . " With all the dignity he could muster , Chan left the witness box and moved slowly down the aisle . At the rear of the room he encountered Kashimo , crouching on a bench . He took him gently by one brown ear , and led him into the hall . " Again , " he remarked , " you let me down with terribletumble . Where do I obtain all this patience I squander on you ? I astound myself . " " So sorry , " hissed Kashimo . " So sorry , so sorry , " repeated Charlie . " Those words fall from your lips in never-ending stream . Can good intentions atone for so many blunders ? Can the morning dew fill a well ? Where were dice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This morning , on his way to court , he had stopped at the barber shop of Kryimota , on Hotel Street , for hair cut . He had hung coat on rack . " After first showing dice to entire shop , no doubt ? " Chan suggested . No  --  he had shown them only to Kryimota , an honorableman . While he submitted to the cut of the hair , various customers had come in and gone out of the shop . The operation finished , he had again donned his coat , and hastened to the courtroom . On his way up the stairs , he had made the unhappy discovery that he was bereft . Charlie regarded him sadly . " You began work as supreme fumbler , " he remarked , " but I think you improveas you go forward . What laughter there must have been among the gods when you were made de-tective. " p 189 " So sorry , " Kashimo said again . " Be sorry out of my sight , " sighed Chan . " While you are in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big strain . " He shrugged his broad shoulders and turned away down the stairs . The police station was on the ground floor , just beneath the courtroom , and at the rear was a small privateoffice that was Chan 's pride and joy . It had been turned over to him by his chief after he had brought to a successful conclusion the case of Shelah Fane , more than a year ago . He went inside now , closed the door , and stood looking through the open window into the alleyway that ran along behind the building . He was still smarting from the incident up-stairs , but that was merely a climax to a year of frustration . " Oriental knows , " he had written to Duff in the letter the Britisher had read aloud in the Vine Street station , " that there is a time to fish , and a time to dry the nets . " But , as he had confessed further along in the same epistle , this eternal drying of the nets was beginning to distress him . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Chinese are not supposed to know . He was troubled by it now as he stared out into the peaceful alley . Over a year since his last big case , and nothing of note had happened . Chasing slightly annoyed gamblers down obscure by-paths , invadingodorous kitchens in search of stills , even sent - to tag cars along King Street  --  was this the career for a Charlie Chan ? Honolulu  --  he loved it  --  but what was 1-lonolulu doing for him ? A prophet is not without honor , save in his own country . Ionolulu did not take him seriously  --  it had laughed at him only this morning . Like that alley out there , it was narrow  --  narrow as was his life . With a ponderous sigh , he sat down at his roll-top desk . It was swept clean  --  clean as the desk of an old man who has retired from business . He swung slowly about in his chair , which creaked in alarm . Gettingolder every day  --  well , his children would carry on . Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Makinga grand record at that mainland university There was a knock on Charlie 's door . He frowned . Kashimo , perhaps , with more of his apologies ? Or the chief , to learn what had happened up-stairs ? " Come ! " Chan called . The door opened , and there on the threshold stood his good friend , Inspector Duff , of Scotland Yard .   A CHINESE does not , as a rule , register surprise , and a good detective learns early in his career the wisdom of keeping his emotions to himself . When you get the two in one package , as in the case of Charlie Chan , you are likely to have something pretty imperturbable . Yet now his eyes widened amazingly , and for a moment his mouth stood open . One would have said that he was , at the least , slightly taken aback . In another moment he had leaped nimbly to his feet , and was moving swiftly toward the door . " My celebratedfriend , " he cried , " for an instant I question the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his hand . " Inspector Chan ! " Charlie took it . " Inspector Duff ! " The  --  Britisher tossed a brief-case down on the desk . " Here I am at last , Charlie . Did I surprise you ? I meant to . " " For a brief space the breath left me , " grinned Charlie . " Putting it more forcefully , I might say I gasped . " He held ready a chair for his visitor , and inserted himself again into the one behind the desk . " I had so long desired this tremendous honor and happiness that I feared I endured hallucination . First question is now in order . What is your opinion of Honolulu , as far as you have got with it ? " Duff considered . " Well , it seems to be a nice clean town , " he admitted . Chan was shaking with silent mirth . " Almost I am drowned in the flood of your enthusiasm , " he re- marked . " But with you it is deeds , not words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tourist nonsense . I make the wager you are here on case . " The other nodded . " I certainly am . " " I wish you no bad luck , but I am hoping you must remain for a lengthy visit . " " Only a few hours , " Duff replied . " I 'm here to meet the President Arthur at this port to-morrow morning , and I expect to go out on her when she sails for San Francisco to-morrow night . " Chan waved a hand . " Too brief , my friend . I am desolate to hear it . But I too know call of duty . You have , no doubt , a suspect on the ship ? " " Seven or eight of them , " Duff answered . " Charlie , I 've had suspects on boats and trains and at railway stations and hotels until I feel like Thomas Cook , or at least like one of the sons . I 'm on the strangest case  --  as soon as your work permits , I want to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if story requires one week to relate , " he replied , " I possess plenty time to listen . " " Not much happening in your line , you wrote me ? " " The Indian philosopher who sat under one tree for twenty years was offensive busybody compared with me , " Chan admitted . Duff smiled . " I 'm sorry . But perhaps in that event you can think about my troubles a bit , and it may be you can make a few suggestions . " The Chinese shrugged . " Does the mosquito advise the lion ? " he inquired . " But I burn to hear what brings you to this somnolent paradise . " " A murder , of course , " Duff answered . " A murder in Broome 's Hotel , in the city of London , on the morn-P193ing of February seventh . Other murders too along the way , but only the first concerns me . " And he launched into his story . Chan listened , paying the rare tribute of silence as he did so . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat like a statue , seemingly as somnolent as the paradise he had mentioned . The little black eyes , however , never left Duff 's face . Though the hands of the British detective busied themselvesfrom time to time with his brief-case , though he took out letters and notes and read from them , still Charlie 's gaze remained riveted where it had been when the long tale began . " And now it 's Welby , " Duff finished at last . " Poor little Welby , shot down in a dark corner of the Yokohamadocks . Why ? Because he had located Jim Everhard , no doubt . Because he had learned the identity of as cruel and ruthless a killer as I have ever been called upon to hunt . By gad , I 'll get him , Charlie ! I must . Never before have I wanted a man so badly . " " A natural feeling , " agreed Chan . " I am a mere outsider , but I can understand . Would you deign to partake of a terrible lunch at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt dismissal of an affair that was , to him , the most important in the world . " Why  --  er  --  you lunch with me , " he suggested . " I 'm stopping at the Young Hotel . " " No debate , please , " Chan insisted . " You arrive over eight thousand miles of land and water , and you think to buy me a lunch . I am surprised . This is Hawaii , land of excessive hospitality . We will go to the Young , but I will demand check in strident terms . "   " About my notes , Charlie . And these letters . I see you have a safe . " Chan nodded . " Yes , station-house safe is in this room . We will lock up your valuable papers there . " They walked up Bethel Street to the main thoroughfare , King , and along that in the direction of the Young . The penetrating midday sun shone down upon them , taxi drivers slept fitfully at their wheels , a radio in a shop doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some further comment was required of him . " Hawaii 's a sort of bright place , is n't it ? " he said . " I mean the light 's rather strong , you know . " Charlie shook his head . " My dear old friend , " he replied , " please do not think that the matter must be attempted . Later I will hand you folders from Hawaii Tourist Bureau , and there you will find the words that now escape you . In the meantime , enjoy yourself . Here is the hotel , where inspeakably humble lunch awaits us . " When they were seated in the Young dining-room , Duff returned to the topic nearest his heart . " What did you think of my story , Charlie ? Did you get a psychic wave about any of the members of that party ? Chinese , I 'm told , are very psychic people . " Chan grinned . " Yes  --  and psychic wave from unknownChinese in Honolulu would rouse great sensation in London , I am sure . A locality where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guilt is demanded than any other place in world . " Duff 's face went grave . " You 're right . That 's the thought which haunts me constantly . I might discoverto my own satisfaction which of those men is Jim Everhard , I might be positive I was right , yet Ip195might still lack enough evidence for a warrant at home . They ask a lot of us at Scotland Yard , Charlie . Every man innocent until proved guilty , and we mean it on the other side . And that affair in Broome 's Hotel on February seventh is a long way in the past now  --  slipping further away each minute , too . " " I do not envy you your task , " Chan told him . " All the greater triumph , however , when you win success at last . Was the soup possible ? Yes ? That is good . One meets so much impossible soup in Hawaii . " His eyes narrowed . " You seek evidently two men , " he added . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Great writer who once lived in these islands wrote book named Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . The Jim Everhardwho had some strange adventure with Honywood couple long ago is now , no doubt , stranger almost to himself . For years he has lived , under new name , respected life without violence . All time former self lies buried from sight , but it simmers there , nursing old grievance , promising to keep old vow . What wakes it  --  what brings it to life again  --  the bitter , halfforgottenself that throws off respectability with wild gesture and is able to strangle and to shoot  --  to shoot so straight without error ? Ah , if we only understood queer twists and turns of human mind . But here is waiter with alleged chicken fricassee . " " It looks very good , " remarked Duff . " Looks , " added Charlie , " are sometimes frightful liar . That is important thing for you to remember as you sail away to-morrow night with Lofton round world party . Jim Everhard looks good , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new lifeP196so perfect from much use . But do not forget , my friend  --  many times honey in the mouth means poison in the heart . " " Of course , " agreed Duff impatiently . He was bitterly disappointed to be met in this anxious hour with general moralizing . It meant nothing , and Charlie must know that himself . Almost the Chinese acted as though he were not interested in the problem . Was it that  --  or was it merely that Chan 's talents were rusty from lying unused so long ? Duff yawned . Would n't be surprising , here in this sunny land where life was so easy , so effortless . A detective needed constant activity , he needed too the tang of sharp winds , flurries of snow . Southern people were always languid , always slow . " If respectability is , in this case , the mark of the criminal , " the Englishman continued , seeking to draw the conversation on to more definite ground , " we have several suspects to offer . Maxy Minchin , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of thinking , is Captain Keane . But we have Doctor Lofton , cool , aloof , the intellectualtype . And we have Tait , a cultivated man of brilliantability  --  oddly enough , in the criminal field himself ; he has spent his life defending criminals . We have Vivian , Ross and Benbow , all men of unimpeachablestanding in their own small worlds . And we have Fenwick , whom we must n't forget  --  a man who holds a high position in a society that struck me as most select . " " You have interest in Fenwick ? " inquired Charlie , " Have you ? " asked Duff quickly . " I could not fail to note how he hovers about like brooding hawk above , " Chan replied . " He leaves partyP 197at Nice , and you think you are finished with him . Yet there he is , at San Remo . In the hotel of the Taj Mahal at Bombay he still persists . " Duff sat up . The easy manner with which Charlie rattled off these names suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his sleepy eyes would indicate . Once again , Duff thought , he had been wronging the Honolulu policeman . Once again , as had frequently happened several years ago in San Francisco , he must hastily revise his opinion of this Chinese . " But how about Yokohama ? " he said . " How about the jeweler 's shop in Calcutta ? In neither of those places did any one see Fenwick . " " You are certain of that ? " Chan inquired . " In point of fact , I 'm not , " Duff replied . " I must look further into the matter . Particularly if you fancy the man , Charlie --  " Chan grinned . " I have not said I fancied him . Maybe it was his name catches my attention . For a moment only . No  --  I have no fancies . Except , perhaps , chocolate ice cream . I make bold to suggest it as final course for this unworthy lunch . " " A bully good lunch , " Duff assured him . When they had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proudly introduced him to the force  --  to his chief , who was obviously impressed , and even to Kashimo , who showed no sign of any emotion , whatever . " Kashimo studies to be great detective like you are , " Chan explained to Duff . " So far fortune does not favor him . Only this morning he proved himself usefulas a mirror to a blind man . But "  --  he patted theP198Japanese on the shoulder  --  " he perseveres . And that means much . " Later in the afternoon Charlie got out , with marked pride , a shining new flivver , and took Duff for a tour of Honolulu and the surrounding section of the island . The Britisher looked , struggled gallantly to express his admiration , proved indeed a perfect guest , but his mind was uneasy . He could not forget that his big problem was still unsolved ; in the midst of a conversationabout something entirely different , that fact would slip back into his thoughts to torment him . At dinner that night at the Royal Hawaiian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same troubled frame of mind . He longed for the morrow and a return to action . The next morning at ten he stood with Charlie on the dock and watched the President Arthur come in . For a time he had considered remaining in the backgroundwhile the ship was in port , but he told himself there was nothing to be gained by that course ; he must see them all again as soon as the liner sailed . He had insisted that Charlie come along and meet the members of the Lofton party . In the back of his head was a dim idea that the Chinese might have a sudden inspiration , a really helpful suggestion to offer . Overnighthe had been thinking of Charlie on the trail of that other killer in San Francisco , and his confidence in his confrere had returned stronger than ever . The big liner docked , and the gang-plank was put down . There was a moment 's confusion at the top and then a motley crowd began slowly to descend . There is always a strange variety to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling inP199the onlooker  --  who are these people ? Salesmen who have carried the creed of pep and hustle to far corners , raw Australians , bowing little Orientals , Englishmen walking secure in the feeling that under their feet is always a little bit of England , pale missionaries , washedoutColonials , and the eternal tourist . Duff watched eagerly , and at his side stood Charlie , as one who hears an oft-told story . Finally Lofton , in a pith helmet , appeared at the top of the plank and then started slowly to walk down it . After him came the twelve members of his party , until at one time on that plank Duff knew the man he sought must be walking . The man who had struck down Welby  --  a sudden anger flamed in the inspector 's heart . As Doctor Lofton reached the pier-shed , Duff stepped forward with outstretched hand . Lofton glanced up . It was not precisely an expression of hearty welcome that crossed the conductor 's face . Rather a look of keen annoyance  --  almost of dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lofton hated to be reminded of certain events now put far behind ? " Ah , Doctor , " Duff cried . " We meet again . " " Inspector Duff , " said Lofton , and managed a wan smile . But now Duff was busily shaking hands with the Benbows , then with the Minchins , with Mrs. Spicer and Vivian , with Kennaway , Ross and the others  --  last of all with Tait , who looked more tired and ill than ever . " Near the end of your journey , eh ? " the Englishman said . They all talked at once ; it appeared that they were slut sorry to step foot on U. S. soil again . Benbow did a little jig on the dock , his camera , hanging from the strap across his shoulder , flying wildly about him . " Ladies and gentlemen , may I present my old friend , Inspector Chan , of the Honolulu Police ? " Duff said . " I just dropped over for a little visit with the inspector , who happens to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked together on a case . " Vivian spoke . " Here for a long stay , Mr. Duff ? " " Unfortunately , no , " Duff told him . " I 'm booked out on your ship to-night . I hope none of you will mind . " " Delighted , " Vivian murmured . The scar on his forehead shone suddenly crimson in the dazzling light of Honolulu . " There are supposed to be cars waiting for us , " Lofton announced . " We 're going out for a swim at Waikiki , and lunch at the Royal Hawaiian . " He bustled about . Duff 's eyes fell on Pamela Potter who was standing , a lovely vision in white , a little away from the others , There was a question in her own eyes ; he shook his head ever so slightly as he approached her . " How did I come to overlook you ? " he inquired , taking her hand . " You 're more charming than ever . The tour must have agreed with you . " And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall see you later to-day . " " We 're taking rooms at the Young , " she answered . " Where in the world is " Tell you later , " Duff murmured . He shook hands with Mrs. Luce . " Hello  --  we 've missed you , " the old lady said . " Well , here I am . Nearly around the world , and have n't been murdered so far . " P 201 " You 're not home yet , " he reminded her . He refused Lofton 's half-hearted invitation to join them for lunch . " You 'll see plenty of me on the ship , " he said jovially . The party entered waiting automobiles and was driven off in the direction of Waikiki . Duff and Charlie walked back to King Street . " Well , there 's my travel crowd , " said the Englishman . " Did you notice a murderer among them ? " Chan shrugged . " Brand of Cain no longer legible , " he returned . " Hasty glance such as I had then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan ? One matter I did note . Nobody boiled over with happiness to see you again . Except maybe beautiful young lady . That Doctor Lofton now " He did seem annoyed , did n't he ? " agreed Duff . " But , you see , I recall the unpleasant past , and I may also bring him some very unfortunate publicity before I 'm through . He 's worried about his business . " " Na more terrible worry than that in modern world , " Chan nodded . " Ask Chamber of Commerce . " They lunched together again , this time with Duff as host . Afterward Charlie was forced to return to the station to attend to some of the minor details of his work . At about two o'clock the Englishman was alone in the lobby of the Young , when Mrs. Luce and Pamela Potter came in . The rest of the party , it appeared , had driven to the Pali , but Mrs. Luce had seen it often , and the girl was eager for a chat with Duff . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bedroom and bath for the remainder of the day . Duff waited until he felt that they were comfortably settled in the suite , then went up-stairs . The girl was alone in the sitting-room . " At last , "  | she greeted him . " I thought I was never going to be able to see you alone . Please sit down . " " Tell me your story first , " Duff said . " When did you see Welby again ? " " What was the last letter you had from me ? " she inquired . " The one from Rangoon , " he told her . " I wrote another from Singapore , and still another from Shanghai . " " I 'm sorry . They 're probably following me about . " " Well , I hope they catch up with you . There was n't any news in them , but they were masterpieces of descriptivewriting . You 'll do very wrong if you miss them . " " I shall read every word when they finally arrive . But no news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . I did n't see Mr. Welby again until I went aboard the President Arthur at Hongkong . He was steward for my cabin , and several others . He told me he 'd learned how to do the work on the British-India boat , and he was efficiency itself . I imagine he began to search the cabins at once , but nothing happened until we got to Yokohama . " " Something happened there ? " asked Duff . " Yes , it did . We spent the day ashore , but I was rather fed up on sightseeing . So I came back to the ship for dinner , though we were n't scheduled to sail until late that night . Mrs. Luce came too . We " Pardon me  --  just a moment . Did you note any other members of the party on the ship at dinner that evening ? " " Yes  --  Mr. Tait was there . He 'd been feeling quite badly and hardly ever made any shore trips . And  --  P203oh , yes  --  Mr. Kennaway . If any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Very good . Go on , please . " " As I was leaving the dining salon , I saw Mr. Welby . He motioned to me and I followed him up to the top deck . We stood by the rail , looking out at the lights of Yokohama . I saw he was very excited . Well , Miss , ' he whispered , the fun 's over . ' I stared at him . What do you mean ? ' I asked . I mean I 've got my man , ' he told me . I 've located that duplicate key  --  number 3260 , and no other . ' " Where is it ? ' I cried . I meant , of course , who has it , but he took me literally . It 's right where I found it , ' he said . I 'm leaving it there until I can get my man to the States and into the hands of Inspector Duff . It 's rather late now to make an arrest in Japan , and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duff wants to get his hands on this lad himself , and I understand he 's already in San Francisco . I 'm going ashore now to send him a cable , care of the Yard , tellinghim to be on the Honolulu dock without fail . I 'm not taking any chance beyond that point . ' " The girl stopped , and Duff sat in silence . Welby had taken too much of a chance as it was ; he had blundered , that was all too plain now . Part he had meant well . And he had paid for his blunder . " I wish to heaven , " said the English detective savagely , " you had made him tell you the name of the holder of that key . " " Well , I certainly tried , " the girl answered . " I begged and pleaded , but Mr. Welby simply would n't listen . He said it would be dangerous for me to know  --  and aside from that , I could see he had old-fashioned ideas about women . Never trust them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a nice little man  --  I liked him  --  so I did n't nag . I told myself I would know all in good time . He went ashore to send that cable . And the next morning , when we were well out at sea , I discovered that he had never come back . " " No , " said Duff quietly . " He never came back . " The girl looked at him quickly . " You know what happened to him ? " " Welby was found dead on the dock soon after your ship sailed . " " Murdered ? " " Of course . " Duff was startled to see that the girl , for all her sophistication , was weeping . " I  --  I ca n't help it , " she apologized . " Such a nice little man . And  --  oh , it 's abominable . That beast ! Shall we ever find him ? We must ! " " Indeed we must , " returned Duff gravely . He got up and walked to the window . Honolulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree in the little park across the way a brown-skinned , ragged boy was sprawled , his steel guitar forgotten at his side . That was the life , Duff thought , not a care in the world , nothing to do until to-morrow and perhaps not then . He heard a door open behind him , and turning , saw Mrs. Luce enter from the bedroom . " Just taking a nap , " she explained . She noted the girl 's tears . " What 's wrong now ? " Pamela Potter told her . The old lady 's face paled , and she sat down suddenly . " Not our little steward , " she cried . " I 've had millions of stewards all over the world , but I 'd takenP 205a particular fancy to him . Well , I shall never make a long trip like this again . Maybe a little run over to China , or down to Australia , but that 's all . I begin to feel old , for the first time in seventy-two years . " " Nonsense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day over fifty . " She brightened . " Do you mean that ? Well , as a matter of fact , I 'll probably get over this soon . After I 've had a good rest in Pasadena  --  I 've never been to South America , you know . I ca n't think how I came to miss it . " " I 've got an invitation for the two of you , " Duff announced . " It sounds quite interesting . That Chinese you met on the dock this morning he 's a good fellow and a gentleman . He 's invited me to his home for dinner to-night , and he told me to bring you along . Both of you . The honor , it appears , is all his . " They agreed to go , and at six-thirty Duff was waiting for them in the lobby . They drove up to PunchbowlHill in the cool of the evening . The mountains ahead of them were wrapped in black clouds , but the town at their backs was yellow and rose in the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his best Americanclothes , his broad face shining with joy . " What a moment in the family history , " lie cried . " Over my threshold steps my old friend from London , in itself an honor almost too great to endure . Additionsto the party make me proud man indeed . " With many remarks about his mean house and its contemptible furniture , he ushered them into the parlor . His unflattering picture of the hospitality he was offeringwas , of course , merely his conception of what wasP206due his guests . The room was a charming one , a rare old rug on the floor , crimson and gold Chinese lanterns hanging from the ceiling , many carved teakwood tables bearing Swatow bowls , porcelain wine jars , dwarfed trees . On the wall was a single picture , a bird on an apple bough , painted on silk . Pamela Potter looked at Charlie with a new interest . She wished certain interior decorators she knew could see this parlor . Mrs. Chan appeared , stiff in her best black silk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older children entered and were ceremoniously presented . " I will not burden you with entire roll-call , " Chan explained . " The matter would , I fear , come to be an ordeal . " He spoke of his eldest daughter , Rose , away at college on the mainland . His voice softened , and his eyes took on a look of sadness . If Rose were here  --  Rose , the flower of his flock  --  how well she would meet this situation , which had somewhat upset his wife 's accustomed calm . An aged woman servant appeared in the doorway and said something in a high shrill voice . They moved on into the dining-room , where Charlie explained that he was giving them a Hawaiian dinner , rather than a Chinese . The initial stiffness wore off , Mrs. Chan finally ventured a smile , and after Mrs. Luce had chatted breezily for a few moments , everybody felt at ease . " My favorite race , the Chinese , Mr. Chan , " the old lady remarked . Charlie bowed . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Not at all . I 've just been cooped up in close quarters with my own for nearly four months , and I repeat the Chinese are my favorite race . "  | " On trip round world you see many of my people , " Chan suggested . " One certainly does  --  does n't one , Pamela ? " " Everywhere , " nodded the girl . " The Chinese are the aristocrats of the East , " Mrs. Luce went on . " In every city out there  --  in the Malay States , in the Straits Settlements , in Siam  --  they are the merchants , the bankers , the men of substance and authority . So clever and competent and honest , carryingon among the lazy riffraff of the Orient . A grand people , Mr. Chan . But you know all that . " Charlie smiled . " All I know , I do not speak . Appreciationsuch as yours makes music to my ears . We are not highly valued in the United States , where we are appraised as laundrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films . You have great country , rich and proud , and sure of itself . About rest of world  --  pardon me  --  it knows little , and cares extremely less . "  --  Mrs. Luce nodded . " Quite true . And sometimes the most provincial among us we reward with a seat in the Senate . Have you visited China recently , Mr. Chan ? " " Not for many years , " Charlie told her . " I saw it last through sparkling eyes of youth . It was peaceful land in those days . " " But not any more , " Pamela Potter said . Chan nodded gravely . " Yes , China is sick now . Butsome one has so well said , many of those who sendsympathy to the sick man will die before him . Thathas happened in China 's past  --  it will happen again . " There was a rush of wind outside , followed by therrific beating of rain upon the roof . " Now I thinkP208there is going to be a shower , " Charlie added . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was still pouring down with tropical fervor when they returned to the parlor . Duff consulted his watch . " I do n't mean to be rude , Charlie , " he explained . " This evening will remain one of the happiest memories of my life . But the President Arthur goes at ten , you know , and it 's past eight-thirty . I 'm a bit nervous over the thought of missing that ship  --  as you can quite understand . Had n't I better telephone for a car " Not to be considered , " Chan protested . " I possess automobile completely enclosed that will hold four with spacious ease  --  even four like myself , if there were such . I know the burden on your shoulders , and will convey you down Punchbowl Hill immediately . " With many expressions of their pleasure in the dinner , they prepared to leave . " It 's the high spot of my trip around the world , " Pamela Potter said , and Charlie and his wife both beamed with delight . In a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillside , the lights of the water front blurred and indistinctin the distance . They stopped at the Young for Duff 's luggage , and the two small bags the women had brought ashore . As they set out for the dock , Duff put his hand to his head . " Good lord , Charlie , " he remarked , " what 's wrong with me , anyhow ? I 'd completely forgotten  --  all my notes about the case are in your safe at the station . " " I had not forgotten , " Charlie answered . " I am taking you there now . I will drop you off , then I will transport ladies to the dock . When I return , you canp209have papers gathered up chief or one of men will open safe for you . We will have last chat , and you shall smoke a final pipe . " " Very good , " Duff agreed . He alighted in a torrentof rain before Halekaua Hale , and the other three went on . At the dock , Charlie bade the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he climbed those worn , familiar steps , his heart was heavy . Duff 's cominghad meant a happy break in the monotony , but the Englishman 's stay was all too brief . To-morrow , Chan reflected , would be like all the other days . The roar of tropic rain still in his ears , he crossed the hallway and pushed open the door of his office . For the second time within thirty-six hours , he encountered the unexpected . Duff was lying on the floor beside the desk chair , his arms sprawled helplessly above his head . With a cry of mingled anger and alarm , Chan ran forward and bent over him . The English detective 's face was pale as death , but placing a quick finger on his pulse , Charlie could feel a slight fluttering . He leaped to the telephone and got the Queen 's Hospital . " An ambulance , " he shouted . " Send it to the police station at once . Be quick , in name of heaven ! " He stood for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual ; out in the murky alley the rain was beating down . The window  --  ah , yes  --  and a sudden bullet from the misty darkness . Chan turned to the desk . On it lay Duff 's open briefcase . Its contents appeared to be intact ; some of the papers were still in the case ; a few were strewn carelesslyabout , scattered , it was clear , by the wind . P210Charlie called , and the chief came in from his office near by . At the same instant , Duff stirred slightly . Chan knelt by his side . The Englishman opened his eyes and saw his old friend . " Carry on , Charlie , " he whispered , and again lapsed into unconsciousness . Chan stood erect , glanced at his watch , and began to gather up the papers on the desk .   THE chief was bending over Duff . His face very grave , he rose from his knees and looked wonderinglyat Chan . " What does this mean , Charlie ? " he wanted to know . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he explained tersely . " Shot in back by bullet entering from there . Poor Inspector Duff . He comes to our quiet city in search of murderer in traveling party landingat this port to-day , and to-night murderer attempts to ply his trade . " " Of all the damned impertinence , " cried the chief , suddenly enraged . " A man shot down in the Honolulu police station --  " Chan nodded . " Even worse than that . Shot down in my  --  very office , of which I have been so proud . Until this killer is captured , I am laughing stock of world . " " Oh , I would n't put it that way , " the chief said . Chan had restored all Duff 's papers to the brief-case , and was strapping it up . " What are you going to do , Charlie ? " " What should I do ? Can I lose face like this and offer no counter attack ? I am sailing to-night on PresidentArthur . " " But you ca n't do that " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeon in this town is ablest man ? " " Well , I suppose Doctor Lang --  " In another second , Chan had the telephone book in his hand , and was dialing a number . As he talked ,  | he heard the clang of an ambulance at the door of Halekaua Hale , and white-coated orderlies entered the hallway with a stretcher . The chief superintended the removal of the unfortunate Duff , while Charlie consultedwith the surgeon . Doctor Lang lived at the Young Hotel , and he promised to be at the Queen 's Hospital almost as soon as the ambulance . Charlie put the receiver back on the hook , then removed it and dialed once more . " Hello , " he said . " This is you , Henry ? You are home early to-night . The gods are good . Listen carefully . Your father speaking . I sail in one hour for the mainland . What ? Kindly omit surprised feelings  --  the matter is settled . I am off on important case . Pull self together and get this straight  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing speed , toothbrush , other suit , razor . Ask yourself what I shall require and bring same . Your honorable mother will assist . Come in your car to dock where President Arthur , Dollar boat , is waiting , bringing my bag and your mother . Boat departs at ten . You will gather that speed is essential . Thank you so much . " As he rose from the telephone , the chief faced him . " Better think this over , Charlie , " he suggested . Chan shrugged . " I have thought it over . " " What do you suggest  --  another leave of absence ? I 'd have to take that up with the commissioners  --  it would require several days --  " Then call it my resignation , " Chan answered briefly . " No , no , " protested the chief . " I 'll fix it somehow . But listen , Charlie . This job is dangerous  --  this man is a killer --  " Who knows that better than I ? Is it important ? p 213My honor is assailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not suggesting that you should n't risk your life , provided it 's in the legitimate line of duty . But I 'd  --  I 'd hate to lose you , Charlie . And this looks to me like Scotland Yard 's affair Stubbornly Chan shook his head . " Not any more . My affair , now . You would hate to lose me  --  from what ? From pursuing fleet gamblers down an alley ? From tagging cars on King Street --  " I understand . Things have been rather slow " Have been  --  yes . But not to-night . Things are plenty fast again . I am on that boat when she sails , and I will have my man before the mainland is reached . If not , I say good-by for all time to title of detective inspector , I retire for ever in sackcloth with ashes . " He went to the safe . " I find here two hundred cash dollars . I am taking same . You will cable me more at San Francisco . Either it is necessary expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police station , or it is my money and I will repay it . Which does not matter . Now I am off for hospital . I am saying good-by --  " No , you 're not , " replied his chief . " I 'll be at the dock when you sail . " Clasping Duff 's precious brief-case under his arm , Chan hurried to the street . With that sudden change of mood characteristic of Honolulu weather , the rain had ceased , and here and there amid the clouds the stars were shining . Charlie went to the lobby of the Young , and accosted the first man he met in the uniform of a ship 's officer . Luck was with him , for the man proved to be one Harry Lynch , purser of the President Arthur.  |p214Chan  introduced himself , and persuaded Mr. Lynch to get into the flivver with him . While he drove to Queen 's Hospital , he hastily explained what had happened . The purser was deeply interested . " The old man told me a Scotland Yard detective was coming aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Welby , of course . It was quite a shock when we lost him so abruptly . The word from Yokohama was simply that the man had been killed . And now Inspector Duff has been wounded , eh ? Well , we 'll be glad to have a police officer aboard . There seems to be plenty of work waiting for you , Mr. Chan . " Charlie shrugged . " My talents are of the slightest , " he protested . " Yeah ? " said Mr. Lynch . " I heard different . " He said no more , but Chan 's heart had warmed toward him . After his long period of inaction , it was good to know that he was remembered . " I 'll fix up the matter of your ticket , " Lynch went on . " We 're running light this crossing , and I can give you a good cabin to yourself . " They were at the hospital now , and Charlie went inside , a feeling of deep anxiety weighing him down . Doctor Lang was pointed out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face lost somewhere in the shadow of an eye shade . " I 've located the bullet , " the surgeon announced , " and I 'm operating at once . Fortunately it was deflectedfrom its course by a rib . It 's a ticklish business , but the man looks to be in remarkably good condition , and he ought to pull through . " " He must , " Charlie said firmly . He told the doctor who Duff was , and why he had come to Honolulu . " Ifp215I could see him for one final moment " he suggested , timid in this unfamiliar place . " Come up to the operating-room , " the surgeon invited . " The patient has talked a little , but it 's delirious talk . However , maybe you can make something of it . " In the rather terrifying , odoriferous room up-stairs , Charlie bent over the sheeted form of his friend . Had Duff caught a glimpse of the man who fired that shot ? If he had , and spoke the name now , the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently . " This is Charlie Chan . Haie , what an awful thing has happened ! I am so sorry . Tell me  --  did you behold face of assailant ? " Duff stirred slightly , and spoke in a thick voice . " Lofton , " he muttered . " Lofton  --  the man with a beard " Charlie held his breath . Was it Lofton who had appearedat the window ? " There 's Tait , too , " Duff muttered . " And Fenwick . Where 's Fenwick now ? Vivian  --  Keane Charlie turned sadly away . Poor Duff was only running over once again the list of his suspects . " Better leave him now , Mr. Chan , " the surgeon said . " I will go , " Charlie replied . " But I must say this last thing . To-morrow or whenever he awakes , you will have most restless patient on your hands . He will warmly desire to rise from bed and follow trail again . When that happens , soothe him with this word from me . Tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will have guilty man before boat reaches shore of mainland . Make it in form of promise , and say it comes from one who has never yet smashed promise to a friend . " The surgeon nodded gravely . " I 'll tell him , Mr. Chan . Thanks for the suggestion . And now  --  we 're going to do our best for him . That 's my promise to you. , , It was nine-forty-five when Charlie and the purser drove on to the dock beside the President Arthur . Not far away , as he alighted , Chan saw his son Henry and with him a dumpy little figure in black silk  --  Mrs. Chan , still in her party finery . He went over , and led them up the gang-plank in the purser 's company . An officer who stood at a little desk at the bottom of the plank eyed them curiously as they passed . On the deck , Mrs. Chan stood looking up at her inexplicable husband with timid eyes . " Wheh you go now , please ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back . " Events break suddenly like fire-crackers in the face of innocent passer-by , " he said . He told her what had happened in his office , and of the need for his immediate departurein order to save his face and regain his lost prestige . The gentle little woman understood . " Plenty clean clo'es in bag , " she told him . She considered for a moment . " I think mebbe dangah wheh you go , " she added . Charlie smiled reassuringly . " What the gods have decreed , man can not alter , " he reminded her . " Can he dodge down by-path and avoid his fate ? Do not fret . All will no doubt be well . And before many days I expect to see our Rose . " In the dim light he saw sudden tears shining on her chubby cheeks . " Much love , " she said . " I send muchp217love . She goes so fah away . " A quick pathetic little wringing of her hands . " I do not unnahstand why she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the proud days to come , " Charlie promised . Little groups of passengers straggled up the gangplank , lingered a moment on the deck , and then drifted off to their cabins . There was to be no excitement attending this sailing evidently . Chan 's chief appeared . " Ah , here you are , Charlie , " he said . " I was able to dig up another sixty dollars for you . " He handed over a roll of bills . " You overwhelm me with kindness , " Charlie answered . " I 'll cable you more to bring you home  --  after you 've got your man , " the chief went on . " You 'll get him , I 'm sure . " " Now that I have time to think it over , i am not so certain-myself , " Chan responded . " Seems this is pretty hard task I have selected . I know from talk with InspectorDuff only one thing will make him happy . I must discover identity of man who committed murder more than three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have remained eight thousand miles away from scene of crime , and I must solve same when clues are cold , trail is covered , and no doubt the one vital point that might have brought about arrest is forgotten by all involved . It appears to me now that to-night I hotly elected myself to superman 's job without possessing necessary equipment . Maybe I come crawling home before long , defeated and expunged of all honor . " " Yes , and maybe not , " returned the chief . " It doesp218look like a difficult task , that 's true , but " He was interrupted by a small panting figure that appeared out of the night and faced Charlie . It was Kashimo . " Hello , Charlie , " the Japanese cried . " Ah  --  this is kind of you to say good-by " Chanbegan . " Never mind good-by , " Kashimo broke in . " I got important information , Charlie . " " Have you indeed ? " Chan answered politely . " Of what nature , Kashimo ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fired injuring your honorable friend , " went on the Japanese breathlessly . " I behold man coming out of alley into lighted street . He is tall man wrapped in big coat , hat over eyes . " " Then you did n't see his face ? " Chan suggested . " What 's the matter , " Kashimo replied . " Face not necessary . Saw something better . The man is very lame , like this " With great histrionic vigor hegave an imitation of a lame man there on the deck . " He carries walking stick , light-colored , maybe Malacca kind . " " I am very grateful , " nodded Charlie , speaking in a voice such as he might have used to his youngest child . " You are observant , Kashimo . You are learning fast . " " Maybe some day I am good detective too , " suggested the Japanese hopefully . " Who can say ? " Chan replied . A deep voice suggested that all who were going ashore had better do so . Charlie turned to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words directed at the chief . The burden of it appeared to be that he shouldp 219be sent to San Francisco as Chan 's assistant . " I am very fine searcher , " the Japanese insisted . " Charlie says so himself . " " How about it , Charlie ? " grinned the chief . " Could you use him ? " Chan hesitated for a second , then he went over and patted the little man on the shoulder . " Consider , Kashimo , " he remarked . " You do not weigh situation properly . Should you and I both be absent from Honolulu at identical moment , what an opportunity for the evil-doers ! Crime wave might sweep over island , almost obliterating it . Run along now , and be good boy while I am gone . Always remember , we learn by our mistakes . First you know , you will be ablest man among us . " Kashimo nodded , shook hands and disappeared down the deck . Charlie turned to his son . " Please arrange that my car is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tie said . " In my absence you will show your mother every deference , and guard whole family well . " " Sure , " Henry agreed . " And say , Dad  --  can use your bus until you come back ? There 's something wrong with that old flivver I inherited from you . " Chan nodded . " I foresaw that request . Yes , you may use my car , but please treat it with unusual kindness . Do not continually demand more than it has to give , like speed-mad young people you imitate . Goodby , Henry . " He said a few low words to his wife , kissed her in Occidental fashion , and led her to the top of the gang-plank . " Good luck , Charlie , " remarked his chief , and shook hands . A chain clanked in the quiet night , and the plankp220was lowered , cutting Chan irrevocably off from the group on the dock . He saw them standing there lookingup at him , and the sight touched him . There was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in his ultimate success . It was a confidence he did not share with them . What was this wild task he had set himself ? He clutched Duff 's brief-case tightly in his arms . Slowly the big liner backed away , out into midstream . No orchestra playing Aloha to-night , no gaily colored streamers floating between ship and shore , none of the picturesque gestures that usually attended island sailings . Just the grim business of getting on with it , the old story of a ship putting out to sea . The little group on the shadowy pier faded finally from his sight ; still he did not move from his post by the rail . The throb of the engines became more pronounced ; the ship was settling down to it . Presently Chan saw the circle of lights that marked , Waikiki Beach . How many nights he had sat on his lanai staring across the town toward that beach , vaguely wishing for action , for something to happen . Well , it had happened at last  --  yes , something had certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship at sea . He turned and regarded the huge bulk of the liner , dark and mysterious behind him . He was in a new world now , a small world , and in it with him was a man who had killed in London through error , had killed again in Nice and San Remo through grim intention , and then again on the Yokohama dock , no doubt through necessity . A ruthless man who had only tonightsought to remove the relentless Duff from hisp221trail . Not a squeamish person , this Jim Everhard . Now for six days Chan and he would be together in a limited space , prisoners on this brave contraption of steel and wood , each seeking to outwit the other . Which would win ? Charlie started . Some one had come up noiselessly behind him , and he had heard a sudden hissing in his ear . He turned . " Kashimo , " he gasped . " Hello , Charlie , " grinned the Japanese . " Kashimo  --  what does this mean ? " " I am hide-away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist on big case . " Chan cast a speculative eye at the breakers between the boat and Waikiki Beach . " Can you swim , Kashimo ? " he inquired . " Not a single stroke , " replied the little man gleefully . Chan sighed . " Ah , well . He who accepts with asmile whatever the gods may send , has mastered mostimportant lesson in life 's hard school . Pardon me onemoment , Kashimo . I am seeking to achieve the smile . "  | IN another moment Chan 's inherent good-nature triumphed , and the smile was accomplished . " You will pardon , Kashimo , if for one instant I was slightly appalled . Can you blame me ? I rememberour last adventure together  --  the affair of the dice . But enterprise such as yours is not to be met with a sneeze . I welcome you into present case  --  which was a most difficult one , even before you arrived . " " Hearty thanks , " replied the Japanese . The purser emerged from a near-by doorway , and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " I 've been looking for you . Just had a chat with the captain and he told me to give you the best I 've got . There 's a cabin with bath  --  at the minimum rate , of course . I 'm having one of the beds made up . If you 'll bring your bag and follow me " He stared at Kashimo . " Andwho is this ? " Chan hesitated . " Er  --  Mr. Lynch , condescend to meet Officer Kashimo , of Honolulu force . One of "  --  he choked a little  --  " our most able men . At last momentit was decided to bring him along in role of assistant . If you can find a place to lay him away for the night Lynch considered . " He 's going as a passenger , too , I suppose ? " A brilliant idea struck Charlie . " Kashimo is specialist , like everybody nowadays . He is grand searcher . If you could find him place in crew which would notTHE MALACCA STICK 223P223consume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that way he could maintain anonymousstanding , which I , alas , can not do . " " One of our boys was pinched in Honolulu to-night for bootlegging , " Lynch replied . " What 's getting into those Federal men , anyhow ? It means a few changes in our assignments . We might make Mr. Kashimo a biscuit boy  --  one of the lads who sit in the alleyways and answer the cabin bells . Of course , it 's not a very dignified job " But a splendid opportunity , " Chan assured him . " Kashimo will not mind . His duty is first with him , always . Kashimo , tell the gentleman how you feel about it . " " Biscuit boys get tips ? " inquired the Japanese eagerly . Charlie waved a hand . " Behold  --  he pants to begin " " Well , you 'd better take him in with you to-night ; Lynch. - said . " Nobody will know about it but your steward , and I 'll tell him not to say anything . " IIe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at eight to-morrow . I do n't mind your searching , but you must n't get caught , you understand . We ca n't have innocent people annoyed . " " Naturally not , " agreed Chan heartily . But he was n't so sure . Annoying innocent people , he reflected , was another of Kashimo 's specialties . " The captain would like to see you in the morning , Mr. Chan , " the purser remarked at the doorway of the cabin to which he led them . He departed . Charlie and Kashimo entered the stateroom . The steward was still there , and Chan directed him to make up the other bed . While they waited , the detective looked about him . A large airy room , a pleasant place to think . And he would have to do much thinking duringthe next six days  --  and nights . " I will return presently , " he said to his assistant . He went to the top deck and dispatched a radiogram . It was addressed to his chief , and in it he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am one to do worrying . He is with me on ship . " Going back to his cabin , he found the Japanese there alone . " I have just broken news to chief about your departure , " he explained . " This biscuit boy business is brilliant stroke . Otherwise question might have come up who pays your passage , and I have deep fear everybodywould have declined the honor . " " Better go to bed now , " Kashimo suggested . Charlie gave him a pair of his own pajamas , and was moved to silent mirth at the resulting spectacle . " You have aspect of deflated balloon going nowhere , " he said . Kashimo grinned . " Can sleep in anything , " he announced , and climbed into bed prepared to prove it . Presently Charlie turned on the light above his pillow , put out all the others , and got into his own bed with Duff 's brief-case in his hand . He undid the straps , and took out a huge sheaf of papers . Duff 's notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover that none was missing . Honywood 's letter to his wife , together with all other messages and documents pertinentto the case , remained intact . Either Jim Everhardhad been afraid to enter the office after his shootingof Duff , or he had felt that there was nothing in these papers he need bother about .   " I trust I shall not disturb you , Kashimo , " Chan remarked . " But stowaways must not be too particular . It is my duty now to read the story of our case , untilI know it perfectly by the heart. ; " , " Wo n't disturb me none , " yawned the Japanese . " Ah , all the fun and no responsibility , " sighed Charlie . " You have happy life . While I read , I shall pay especial attention to lame man in the party . What was he doing at mouth of alley when poor Mr. Duff lay shot in my office ? You gave me point of attack on case with that news , and I am grateful . " He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . London , all his life a name and nothing more , became a familiar city . He saw the little green car set out from Scotland Yard , he stepped inside the sacred portalsof Broome 's Hotel , he bent above the lifeless form of Hugh Morris Drake as it lay on the bed in room 28 . Descending to the musty parlor of the hotel , he witnessed Tait 's heart attack on the threshold , noted Honywood 's haunted look . Then on to Paris , and Nice : Honywood dead in the garden . San Reno , and that terrible moment in the lift . Carefully he read Honywood 's epistle to his wife , which explained so much but left the vital question unanswered . Every detail in the long case burned itself into his mind now . True , he had been all over it with Duff , hut then the affair had seemed so remote , so little to concern him . It concerned him to-night . He was in Duff 's shoes , the case was his ; nothing must escape him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report of Duff 's talk with Pamela Potter in Honoluluthat very afternoon , - in which she had told of Welby 's discovery of the key . It was a matter of pride with Duff that he kept his notes up to the minute . Chan finished reading . " Kashimo , " he remarked thoughtfully , " that man Ross has intriguing sound . What about Ross ? Always in the background , limpingalong , never a hint against him  --  until now . Yes , Kashimo , the matter of Mr. Ross must be our first concern . " He paused . A loud snore from the bed across the way was his only answer . Charlie looked at his watch , it was past midnight . He turned back to the beginning and read it all again . It was after two o'clock when he finally put out his light . Even then , he was not ready to sleep . He lay there , planning the future . At seven-thirty he rudely dragged his small assistant out of slumberland . Kashimo was lost in the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a realization of where he was . While he made his sketchy toilet Charlie told him a little of the case , with special emphasis on the part the Japanese was to play . He was to search among the possessions of the travel party for a key bearing the number 3260 . He might find it , he might not  --  perhaps by this time it was at the bottom of the Pacific . But the effort must be made anyhow . The Japanese nodded in a dazed , uncomprehendingsort of way , and at two minutes of eight was ready for his interview with the chief steward . " Remember , Kashimo , too much haste may have fatal ending , " was Chan 's final admonition . " Take plenty of time and know what you are doing before you do it . You are biscuit boy from now on , and if we meet on ship , you have never seen me before . All talks betweenTHE MALACCA STICK 227p227us are conducted with utmost secrecy in this cabin . Farewell , and best of luck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out . Charlie stood for a moment at the port-hole , gazing at the sunlit sea and breathing in great drafts of the bracing air . There is something invigorating about the first morning on a ship , the cool peace , the feeling of security away from the land 's alarms . A sense of well-being an*onfidence flooded Chan 's heart . It was t glorious day , and the future looked promising . He was shaving when a boy knocked at his door and handed him a radiogram from his chief . He read : " Surgeon reports operation O. K. Duff doing fine . Sincere condolences on Kashimo . " Charlie smiled . Great news , that about Duff . In a cheerful frame of mind he stepped out on to the deck to face his problems . The first person he saw was Pamela Potter , who was taking a morning stroll , accompanied by Mark Kennaway . The girl stopped , and stared . " Mr. Chan , " she cried . " What are you doing here ? " Charlie managed a low and sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you . You appear to be doing the same . " " But I 'd no idea you were coming with us . " " I had no idea myself , until late hour last night . In me you behold quite worthless replacement for InspectorDuff . " She started . " He  --  you do n't mean that he , too " Do not be alarmed . Wounded only . " Quickly he reported what had happened.  | The girl shook her head . " There seems to be no end to it , " she said . " What begins , must finish , " Chan told her . " Miscreantin this case is clever enough to play a fiddle behind his back , but ever the cleverest have been known to blunder . I believe I saw this young man on the dock yesterday . The name  --  " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " the girl replied . " I was so startled to see you . Inspector Chan  --  this is Mr. Kennaway . I 've just been telling him what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset . You know , lie belongs to such a family in Boston , and he is n't accustomed to being left out . " " Nonsense , " Kennaway said . " He would have been very welcome , " Charlie remarked . He turned to the young man . " I myself have keen interest in Boston , and some day we must enjoy small talk about same . Just now I will not further interruptyour perambulations . Since I was introduced to your entire party yesterday , full name and title , it will be useless for me to attempt dissemble of my identity . So I propose to meet all of you presently for little chat about last night . " " Same old story , " Kennaway replied . " We 've been gathered together to meet policemen at frequent intervalsever since the tour started . Well , you 're bringing a new face into it , and that 's something . I wish you luck , Inspector Chan . " " Thank you so much . I shall do my best . True , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am encouraged when I remember old saying which remarks , the turtle that enters the house at the rear gate comes finally to the head of the table . " THE MALACCA STICK 229 " Ah , yes  --  in the soup , " Kennaway reminded him . Chan laughed . " Ancient proverbs must not he taken too literally . Pardon me while I sample the cuisine of this vessel . At some later hour I shall sample your society more extensively . " He went to the dining saloon , where he was given a good table to himself . After a hearty breakfast , he rose to leave . At a seat near the door , he saw Doctor Lofton . He stopped . " Ah , Doctor , " he said . " Perhaps you do me the honor to recall my face ' ? " Lofton glanced up . Few people could look at Charlie without a friendly smile , but the doctor managed it . In fact , his expression was a rather sour one . " Yes , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I am inspector of detectives , attached to Honolulu station , " Charlie explained . " May I sit down , please ? " " I suppose so , " Lofton growled . " But do n't blame me if m5r feelings are none too cordial . I 'm a bit fed up with detectives . Where is your friend Duff this morning ? " Charlie raised his eyebrows . " You have not heard what happened to Inspector Duff ? " " Of course not , " snapped Lofton . " I 've got twelve people to look after , and I can assure you that they keep me busy . I ca n't bother with every policeman who tags along . What 's happened to Duff ? Come on , man  --  speak ! Do n't tell me he 's been killed , too ? " " Not entirely , " Chan answered gently . He told his story , his little black eyes fixed on Lofton 's face . He was amazed at the lack of shock or sympathy on that bearded countenance.  | " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this tour is concerned , " the doctor remarked , when Chan had finished . " And now what ? " " Now I replace poor Duff . " Lofton stared at him . " You ! " he cried rudely . " Why not ? " asked Charlie blandly . " Well , no reason , I suppose . You 'll pardon me , but my nerves have been completely upset by the events of the last few months . Thank God , we break up at San Francisco , and it 's a question in my mind if I ever go out again . I 've been thinking of retiring , and this is as good a time as any . " " Whether you do or not is a private and personal matter , " Chan told him . " What is not so private is , what is name of the killer who has honored you with his presence on this journey ? It is an affair I am here to look into , with full authority to do so . If you will get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall launch the campaign . " Lofton glared at him . " How long , 0 Lord , how long ? " he said . " I shall be brief as possible . " " You know what I mean . How long must I continue to gather my party together for these inquisitions ? Nothing ever comes of them . Ever has , or ever will , ; f you ask me . " Charlie gave him a searching look . " And you would be sorry if anything did , " he ventured . Lofton returned the look . " Why should I try to deceive you ? I am not longing for any final flare of publicity about this matter . That would mean the end of my touring days , and no mistake . An unpleasant end , too . No , what I want is a petering out of theP231whole business . You see , I intend to be frank with you . " " Quite refreshing , thank you , " bowed Charlie . " I 'll get the party together , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help from me , you 'll be looking in the wrong place . " " Looking in wrong place is always terrible waste of time , " Chan assured him . " I 'm glad you realize that , " Lofton answered , and rising , moved toward the door . Chan followed meekly at his heels . Going up to see the captain of the ship , Charlie encountered a more cordial greeting . That old sea-dog heard the story of the chase with mounting indignation . " All that I can say is , I hope you get your man , " he remarked at last . " I 'll give you every help possible . But remember this , Mr. Chan . A mistake would be a serious thing . If you came to me and asked me to have some one put under restraint , and he proved to be the wrong person , I 'd be in a hell of a hole . The line would probably never hear the end of it  --  lawsuitsand all that . We 'll have to be very sure what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship like this should always be sure what he is doing , " Chan suggested mildly . " I promise to use every care . " " And I know you will , " smiled the captain . " I have n't been on the Pacific run these past ten years without hearing about you . I have every confidence in you , but I could n't under the circumstances , fail to point out my position . If an arrest becomes necessary , let 's try to have it made on the San Francisco dock . That would avoid many complications . "  | " You call up pretty picture , " Chan remarked . " I hope it eventuates . " " So do I , " nodded the captain , " with all my heart . " Charlie went back to the promenade deck . He saw Kashimo flit by , resplendent in a new uniform which fitted him only in spots . Pamela Potter was sitting in a deck chair , and waved to him . He joined her . " Your friend Mrs. Luce is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sleeps late at sea , and has breakfast in her cabin . Did you want to speak with her right away ? " " I wished talk with the two of you . But you alone suffice in a very pleasant manner . Last night I set you down on dock at about nine o'clock . Tell meyhatmembers of travel party did you encounter betweenthat hour and moment of retiring ? " " We saw several of them . The stateroom was quite warm , so we went up and sat in steamer chairs near the top of the gang-plank . The Minchins came aboard presently , and Sadie stopped to show us her day 's loot . A ukulele for that boy of hers at military school , among other things . Then Mark Kennaway came on , but he did n't stop with us . He thought Mr. Tait might want him for the eternal bedtime story . Then the Benbows , Elmer all loaded down with exposed film . That was all , I guess . Mr. Kennaway came back to us in a few minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he appeared to think that rather sur-prising . " " Those were all . No man with a Malacca stick ? " " Oh  --  Mr. Ross , you mean . Yes , he was one of the first , I think . He came limping aboard THE MALACCA STICK 233 " Pardon me  --  at about what time ? " " It must have been about nine-fifteen . He passed where we were sitting  --  I thought he was limping even more than usual . Mrs. Luce spoke to him , but oddly enough , he did n't answer . He just hurried on down the deck . " " Can you tell me  --  is his ' the only Malacca stick in the party ? " The girl laughed . " My dear Mr. Chan  --  we spent three days in Singapore , and if you do n't buy a Malacca stick there , they wo n't let you leave . Every man in our party has one at least . " Charlie frowned . " Indeed ? Then how can you be absolutely certain it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man was limping --  " " Simplest thing in the world to imitate . Think hard . Was there no other way in which you could identify him ? " The  --  girl sat for a moment in silence . " How 's this ? " she remarked at last . " Getting to be some little detectivemyself . The sticks that were bought in Singaporeall had metal tips  --  I noticed that . But Mr. Ross 's stick has a heavy rubber tip on it . It makes no noise when he walks along the deck . " " And the stick of the man who passed you last night " It made no sound . So the man must have been Mr. Ross . Am I good ? Just to show you how good I am , I 'll give you a demonstration . Here comes Mr. Ross now . Listen ! " Ross had appeared in the distance , and was swinging along toward them . He passed with a nod and a smile , and disappeared around the corner . Chan and the girl looked at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had heard the steady " tap-tap-tap " of metal on the hard deck . " Well , of all things , " cried the girl . " Mr. Ross 's stick has lost its rubber tip , " Charlie said . She nodded . " What can that mean ? " " A puzzle , " Chan answered . " And unless I am much mistaken , the first of many aboard this ship . Why should I worry ? Puzzles are my business . " P235T A little before ten , Lofton appeared in front of the chair where Chan was sitting . He still had the air of a much-abused man . " Well , Inspector , " he announced , " I 've got my people together in the smoking-room . I chose that spot because it 's always deserted at this hour . A bit odoriferous , perhaps  --  I trust you wo n't hold them there long . I suggest you come at once . Keeping a touring party intact in one place for any length of time is , I have discovered , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also come , Miss Pamela ? " he suggested . As they walked along , he added to the doctor : " Am I to understand that all members of band are present ? " " All except Mrs. Luce , " Lofton told him . " She prefers to sleep late . But I 'll have her roused , if you say so . " " Not at all , " Chan replied . " I know where Mrs. Luce was last evening . Matter of fact , she ( lined at my house . " " Not really ? " cried the doctor , with unflattering surprise . " You would have been welcome yourself , " Charlie smiled . They entered the thick atmosphere of the smokingroom , redolent of old , unhappy , far-off things , and bottles , long ago . The group inside regarded Chan235 with frank curiosity . He stood for a moment , facing them . A little speech seemed indicated . " May I extend courteous good morning ? " he began . " Would say I am as surprised to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am reluctant to enforce my inspeakable presence upon you , but fate will not have it otherwise . Inspector Duff , as you know , was awaiting you at Honolulu , Paradise of Pacific , intending to travel eastward in your company . Last night in paradise history repeats and snake appears , striking down the worthy Duff . He is much better this morning , thank you . Maybe plenty soon he sees you all again . In meantime , a stupid substitute for Duff has been pushed into position for which he has not the brains , the wit , the reputation . Notably  --  myself . " He smiled pleasantly and sat down . " All mischief comes from opening the mouth , " he continued . " Knowingthis , I am still forced to operate mine to considerableextent from now on . Let us make the best of it . My initial effort will be to find out from each of you exact presence between hour of  --  may I say  --  eight last evening , and sailing of boat at ten . Pardon such outrageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true may have cause to regret same later on . I have said I am dull and stupid , and that is the fact , but often the gods go out of way to take care of such . To recompense , they shower on me sometimes amazing luck . Look out I do n't get shower at any moment . " Patrick Tait was on his feet . " My dear sir , " he remarked irritably , " I question your authority to interrogateany of us . We are no longer in Hono-lulu   " Pardon interruption , but what you say is true , " Charlie put in . " Legal side of matter is no doubt such as to give eminent lawyer bad attack of choleric . I judge from records of case same has happened before . Can only say captain of ship stands behind me firm as Gibraltar rock . We proceed on assumption every one of you is shocked and grieved by attack on Duff , and eager to see the attacker captured . If this is wrong  --  if there is man among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tait cried . " I wo n't let you maneuverme into that position . I 've nothing to hide . I only wanted to remind you that there is such a thing as legal procedure . " " Which is usually the criminal 's best friend , " nodded Chan blandly . " You and I  --  we know . Do we not , Mr. Tait ? " The lawyer sank back into his chair . " But we are some miles off the point , " continued Charlie . " You are all friends of justice , I feel certain . You have no interest in that poor relation of same , legal procedure . Let us go forward on such basis . Doctor Lofton , since you are conductor of party , I begin with you . How did you spend two hours mentioned by me ? " " From eight to about nine-thirty , " said Lofton sourly , " I was at the Honolulu office of the Nomad Travel Company , which manages my tours for me . I had a lot of accounts to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . Of course , others were with you at that office ? " " Not a soul . The manager was due to attend a country club dance , and he left me there alone . Since the door had a spring lock , I had only to close it after me when I went out . I returned to the ship at about nine-thirty . " " Nomad Travel Company office is , I believe , on Fort Street ? Only few steps from mouth of alley wandering along rear of police station . " " It 's on Fort Street , yes . I do n't know anything about your police station . " " Naturally you do n't . Did you encounter any members of travel party in neighborhood of alley ? " " I have no idea what alley you 're talking about . I saw none of my people from the time I went to the office until I returned to the ship . I suggest you get on with this . Time is pressing . " " Whom is it pressing ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to squander . Mr. Tait , do you cling to legal rights , or will you condescend to tell humble policeman how you spent last evening ? " " Oh , I 've no objection , " returned Tait , amiable with an effort . " Why should I have ? Last night , about eight o'clock , we started a contract bridge game in the lounge . Aside from myself , Mrs. Spicer , Mr. Vivian and Mr. Kennaway took part in it . It 's a foursome that has had many similar contests as we went round the world . " " Ah , yes  --  travel is fine education , " nodded Chan . " You played until the boat sailed . " " We did not . We were having a splendid game when , at about eight-thirty , Mr. Vivian raised the most unholy row " I beg your pardon , " Vivian cut in . " If I broke lip the game , I had an excellent reason . You have heard me tell my partner a thousand times that if I makep239an original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if " So  --  you told me that a thousand times , did you ? " flared Mrs. Spicer . " A million would be more like it . And I 've explained patiently to you that if I had a flat hand , I would n't bid  --  no , not even if Mr. Whitehead was sitting beside me with a gun . The trouble with you is , a little knowledge is a dangerous " Pardon me that I burst in , " Charlie said , " but the matter becomes too technical for my stupidity to cope with . Let us seize on fact that game broke up . " " Broke up in a row , at eight-thirty , " Tait continued . " Mr. Kennaway and I went out on to the deck . It was raining hard . Mark said he thought he 'd get his rain-coat and take a stroll up to the town . I saw him leave about ten minutes later . I told him I preferred to stay aboard . " " And did you ? " Charlie asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kennaway had gone , 1 remembered that I 'd seen a copy of the New York SundayTimes hanging outside a news-stand on King Street yesterday morning . I 'd meant to go back and get it . had n't seen one for ages , and I was keen to have it . The rain seemed to be letting up a bit . So I got a coat , my hat and stick --  " " Your Malacca stick ? " " Yes  --  I believe I carried the Malacca . At about ten minutes of nine I walked up-town , bought the paper , and returned to the ship . I 'm a slow walker , and I suppose it was about twenty minutes past the hour when I came aboard again . " Chan took his watch from his left-hand vest pocket. 240 CHARLIE CHAN CARRIES ON THE GREAT EASTERN LABEL 241 " What time have you now , Mr. Tait ? " he asked quickly . Tait 's right hand went to his own waistcoat pocket . Then it dropped back to his lap , and he looked rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watch on it . " I make it ten-twenty-five , " he announced . " Correct , " smiled Charlie . " I make it the same , and I am always right . " Tait 's bushy eyebrows rose . " Always ? " he repeated , with a touch of sarcasm . " In such matters  --  yes , " nodded the Chinese . For a moment he and the lawyer stared at each other . Then Chan looked away . " So many changes of time as you peruse way around world , " he said softly . " I merely wished to be certain your watch is up to date . Mr. Vivian , what was your course of action after bridge table eruption ? " " I , too , went ashore , " Vivian responded . " I wanted to cool off . " " With hat , coat and Malacca stick , no doubt ? " suggestedCharlie . " We 've all got Malacca sticks , " snapped the polo player . " They 're almost obligatory when you visit Singapore . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship a few minutes before it sailed . " " Mrs. Spicer ? " Charlie 's eyes turned in her direction . She looked weary and fed-up . " I went to bed when I left the bridge table , " she told him . " It had been a somewhat trying experience . Bridge is only fun when you happen to have a gentle . nnan for a partner . "  | " Mr. Kennaway , your actions have already been detailedby Mr. Tait . " Kennaway nodded . " Yes  --  I took my little stick and went ashore . I did n't stay long , however . I thought Mr. Tait might want me to read to him , so I came back to the ship soon after nine . But Mr. Tait , to my surprise , was n't aboard . He appeared about ninetwenty , as he told you , and he had the Times under his arm . We went to our cabin , and I read to him from the paper until he fell asleep . " Charlie looked around the circle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And nothing to hide , get me ? " Charlie bowed . " Then you will be glad to detail your actions ? " " Yes  --  and it 'll take just one minute  --  see ? " Mr. Minchin fondled an expensive , half-smoked cigar , from which he had failed to remove a shining gold band . " Me and Sadie  --  that 's the wife  --  was doing the town , in the rain . Well , the evening was n't so much on the up and up with me , so I dragged the frau into a pitcher show . But we seen that filum a year ago in Chi. , and Sadie was itching to get back to the stores , so we made our get-away quick . After that , just buying right and left . We did n't have no truck with us , and when we could n't handle no more , Sadie agreed to quit . We staggered back to the ship . I did n't have no gat on me , and I was n't carrying no Malacca stick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs ai n't no good no more  --  I told Sadie that in Singapore . " Charlie smiled . " Mr. Benbow ? " he suggested . " Same story as the Minchins , " that gentleman re/plied . " We did the stores , though they 're not much after those Oriental bazaars . Sat a while in the Young lobby and watched it rain . I said I wished I was back in Akron , and Nettie practically agreed with me . First time we 've been in accord on that point since the tour started . But we were on good old U. S. soil , even if it was pretty sloppy , and we came back to the ship walking high , wide and handsome . I think we stepped aboard about nine-fifteen . I was dead tired  --  I 'd bought a motion picture projector in Honolulu , and the weight of one of those things is nobody 's business . " " Miss Pamela , " said Chan . " I already know how your evening was spent . Leaving , I think , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keane , I believe . " Keane leaned back , stifled a yawn , and clasped his hands behind his head . " I watched the bridge for a while , " he replied . " Not as a kibitzer , you understand . " He glanced at Vivian . " I never interfere in affairs that do n't concern me . " Recalling the captain 's record outside various doors , Charlie felt the remark was somewhat lacking in sincerity . " And after the bridge " he prompted . " When the battle broke , " Keane went on , " I took to the open air . Thought some of getting my own little Malacca stick and going ashore , but the rain gave me pause . Never did care for rain , especially the tropical kind . So I went to my cabin , got a book , and returned here to the smoking-room . " " Ah , " remarked Chan . " You now possess a book . " " What are you trying to do , razz me ? " said the captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the time the boat sailed , I went to bed . "   " Was any one else in this room while you were ? " " Nobody at all . Everybody ashore , including the stewards . " Charlie turned to the man whom he had purposely saved until the last . Ross was sitting not far away , staring down at his injured foot . His stick , innocent of its rubber tip , lay beside him on the floor . " Mr. Ross , I believe you will complete the roster , " Chan remarked . " You went ashore last evening , I have heard . " Ross looked up in surprise . " Why , no , Inspector , " he replied . " I did n't . " " Indeed ? Yet you were seen to come aboard ship at nine-fifteen . " " Really ? " Ross lifted his eyebrows . " On authority not to be impeached . " " But  --  I am sorry to say  --  in this case quite mis-taken . " " You are sure you did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the sort of thing I ought to know about , you must admit . " He remained entirelyamiable . " I dined aboard , and sat in the lounge for a while after dinner . I 'd had a rather hard day  --  a lot of walking , and that tires me . My leg was aching , so I retired at eight o'clock . I was sound asleep when Mr. Vivian , who shares my cabin , came in . That was in the neighborhood of ten , he told me this morning . He was careful not to wake me . Ile is always most considerate . " Chan regarded him thoughtfully . " Yet at ninefifteen , as I have said , Mr. Ross , two people of unreproachablehonesty saw you come up the plank , and you passed them on deck . "  | " May I ask how they recognized me , Inspector ? " " You carried stick , of course . " " A Malacca stick , " nodded Ross . " You have seen what that amounts to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with customary difficulty , owing to unhappy accident which is so deeply deplored by all . " For a moment Ross regarded the detective . " Inspector , " he remarked at last , " I 've watched you here . You 're a clever man . " " You exaggerate shamelessly , " Charlie told him . " No , I do n't , " smiled Ross . " I say you 're clever , and I believe that all I need do now is to tell you about a queer little incident that happened on this ship late yesterday afternoon . " He picked up his stick . " This was not bought in Singapore , but in Tacoma some months ago just after I had my accident . After I bought it , I looked around until I found a rubber tip  --  a shoe , I believe it is sometimes called  --  to fit over the end of it . This made walking easier for me , and it did not scratch hardwood floors . About five yesterday afternoon , I returned to the ship and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went down to dinner , 1 was conscious of something  --  something wrong  --  at first I did n't know just what . But presently I realized . As I walked , my stick was tapping on the deck . I looked down in amazement . The rubber tip was gone . Some one had taken it . " He stopped . " I remember Mr. Kennaway came along at that moment , and I told him what had happened . " " That 's right , " Kennaway agreed . " We puzzled over the matter . I suggested somebody was playing a joke . '   " It was no joke , " remarked Ross gravely . " Some one , I now believe , was planning to impersonate me for the evening . Some one who was clever enough to recall that my stick made no sound when it touched a hard surface . " No one spoke . Mrs. Luce appeared in the distant doorway , and came swiftly to Chan 's side . The detectiveleaped to his feet . " What 's this I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not badly injured , " Charlie assured her . " Re-covering . " " Thank heaven , " she replied . " The aim is wavering . The arm is getting weak . Well , too much shootingis bad for anybody . I take it you are with us in Inspector Duff 's place , Mr. Chan ? " " I am unworthy substitute , " he bowed . " Unworthy fiddlesticks ! You ca n't put that over on me . Known Chinese most of my life  --  lived among ' em . At last we 're going to get somewhere . I 'm sure of it . " She glanced belligerently around the circle . " And about time , if you ask me . " " You arrive at good moment , " Charlie said . " I will request your testimony , please . Last night , after I brought you to dock , you and Miss Pamela sat on deck near top of gang-plank . You beheld several members of party return to ship . Among them , Mr. Ross here ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she shook her head . " I do n't know , " she answered . Chan was surprised . " You do n't know whether you saw Mr. Ross or not ? "  | " No , I do n't " " But , my dear , " said Pamela Potter , " surely you remember . We were sitting near the rail , and Mr. Ross came up the plank , and passed us " Again Mrs. Luce shook her head . " A man who walked with a stick , and limped , passed us  --  yes . I spoke to him , but he did n't answer . Mr. Ross is a polite man . Besides " Yes ? " Charlie said eagerly . " Besides , Mr , Ross carries his stick in his left hand , whereas that man last night was carrying his in the right . I noticed it at the time . That 's why I say I do n't know whether it was Mr. Ross or not . My own feeling at the moment was that it was not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did I tell you , Inspector ? " he remarked . " I did not leave the ship last evening . I had rather a hunch the matter would be proved in time , though I did n't expect the proof so soon . " " Your right leg is injured one , " Charlie said . " Yes  --  and any one who has never suffered such an injury might suppose that I would naturally carry my stick in the right hand . But as my doctor pointed out to me , the left is better . I am more securely balanced , and I can move much faster . " " That 's O. K. Officer , " put in Maxy Minchin . " A few years back a'n old pal of mine winged me in the left calf . I found out then the dope was to carry the cane on the opposite side . It gives you better support  --  get me ? " Ross smiled " Thank you , Mr. Minchin , " he said . He glanced at Chan . " These clever lads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added . " Here is one whop247had brains enough to-want my rubber shoe so his stick could n't be distinguished on that score  --  and them , in his haste , forgot to notice in which hand I carried mine . Well , all I can say is , I 'm very glad he did . " Ills eyes traveled questioningly about the little circle . Charlie stood up . " Meeting now adjourns for time being , " he announced . " I am very grateful to you all for kind cooperating . " They filed out , until Tait alone - remained with the detective . He strolled over to Chan with a grim smile on his face . " You did n't get much out of that session , " he remarked . " You believe not ? " Chan inquired . " No , but you did your best . And on one point , at least , you showed unusual acumen . That about the watch , I mean . " " Ah , yes  --  the watch , " Charlie nodded . " A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch in his vest pocket , and then switches to a wrist-watch , is inclined to put his hand to the old location when suddenly asked the time . " " So I noticed , " the detective replied . " I thought you did . What a pity you wasted that experiment on an innocent man . " " There will be more experiments , " Chan assured him . " I hope so . I may tell you that I purchased a wristwatchjust before I came on this tour . " " Before you came on the tour . " The first word was accented ever so slightly . " Exactly . I can prove that by Mr. Kennaway . Any time at all . "   " For the present , I accept your word , " Charlie replied . " Thank you . I trust I shall be present when you attempt those other experiments . " " Do not worry . You are plenty sure to be there . " " Good . I like to watch you work . " And Tait strode debonairly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The investigation was young yet , Charlie thought , as he walked toward his cabin to prepare for lunch . No great progress this morning , but a good beginning . At least he had now a pretty shrewd idea as to the character and capabilities of the people with whom he had to deal . Know them better to-morrow . No place like a ship for getting acquainted . A boy appeared with a radiogram . Chan opened it and read : " Charlie , as a friend , I implore you to drop the whole matter . I am getting on beautifully and can take up the trail soon myself . Situation is far too dangerous for me to ask such a service of you . Believe me , I was quite delirious when I suggested you carry on . Duff . " Charlie smiled to himself , and sat down at a desk in the library . After due deliberation , he composed an answering message : " You were not delirious last night , but I have deep pain to note you are in such state now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to very frontier of my ability this interesting affair ? Remain calm , get back health promptly , and meantime I am willingp249replacement . Hoping you soon regain reason I remain your solid friend , C. Chan . " After lunch , Charlie spent several hours meditating in his ' cabin . This was a case after his own heart , six long days to ponder it , while the person he sought must stay within easy reach of his hand . That evening after dinner the detective came upon Pamela Potter and Mark Kennaway having coffee in a corner of the lounge . At the girl 's invitation , he joined them . " Well , Mr. Chan , " she remarked , " one of your precious six days is gone . " " Yes , and where are you ? " Kennaway inquired . " Two hundred and fifty miles from Honolulu , and moving comfortably along , " Chan smiled . " You did n't learn much this morning ? " the young man suggested . " I learned that my friend the murderer still seeks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Lofton 's luggage strap in London . " " You mean that about Ross ? " the girl asked . Charlie nodded . " Tell- me  --  you agree now with Mrs. Luce ? " " I do , " she answered . " I thought at the time that person was limping very weirdly  --  much more than Mr. Ross ever had . Who could it have been ? " " It might have been any of us , " said Kennaway , looking at Chan over his cup . " How right you are , " returned the detective . " Any of you who wandered about rainy town , assisted on way by Malacca stick . " " Or it might even have been the lad who could n't tear himself away from his book , " the young man suggested . " Or claims he could n't . I refer to jolly old Captain Keane , the irrepressible reader . " " Ah , yes  --  Keane , " Chan said . " Has any one ever determined cause of Keane 's fondness for loitering outsidewrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pamela Potter replied . " As a matter of fact , he has n't been doing it much lately . Mr. Vivian caught him at it just after we left Yokohama , and the row could be heard for blocks . If there 'd been any blocks , I mean . " " Mr. Vivian has special talent for rows , " Charlie noted . " I 'll say he has , " Kennaway agreed . " That last night made bridge look like one of the more hazardous occupations . I thought Vivian started it with very little reason . It almost looked as though he wanted to break up the game . " Chan 's eyes narrowed . " Mr. Kennaway , I understandyour employer , Mr. Tait , bought a wrist-watch just before he left New York ? " The young man laughed . " Yes  --  he warned me you were going to ask that . He did . Thought it would be more convenient on a long tour . He has his old watch and chain in his trunk , I believe . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intact , of course ? " " Oh , naturally . Or was when I saw it last  --  in Cairo . " Tait came up to them . " Mrs. Luce and I are getting up a bridge game , " he announced . " You young people are elected . " " But I 'm a terrible player , " the girl protested . " I know you are , " the lawyer replied . " That 's whyP251I 'm going to assign you to Mark as a partner . I feel I 'm going to win . I love to win . " Kennaway and the girl got up . " Sorry to leave you , Mr. Chan , " the latter said . " I would not interfere with your pleasure , " he returned . " Pleasure ? " she repeated . " You 've heard about the slaughter of the ' innocents . Have n't you an old Chinese proverb to comfort me ? " " I have one which might have warned you , " Charlie told her . " The deer should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best bridge rule I ever heard , " the girl answered . After a time , Charlie rose and walked out on to the deck . He was standing in a dark corner by the rail when he heard a stealthy hiss out of the night . He had completely forgotten Kashimo . His slim little assistant came close . Even in the dark it . was evident that he bubbled over with mystery and excitement . " Search all over , " he whispered breathlessly . " What ! " breathed Charlie . " I have discovered key , " the Japanese replied . Chan 's heart leaped at the words . Welby , he recalled , had also discovered the key . " You are quick worker , Kashimo , " the Chinese said . " Where is it ? " " Follow me , " directed Kashimo . He led the way into the corridor , and to a de luxe cabin on the same deck . At the door , he paused . " Who occupies this room ? " Charlie asked anxiously . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushing open the door , flooded the cabin with light . Remembering the bridge game with relief , Charlie followed , closing the door behind him . He noticed that the port-holes , which opened on the promenadedeck , were safely shuttered . Kashimo knelt , and dragged from beneath one of the beds a battered old bag . It was plastered with the labels of foreign hotels . The Japanese made no effort to open it , but lovingly ran his fingers over a particularly gorgeouslabel  --  that of the Great Eastern Hotel , Calcutta . . " You do same , " he suggested to Charlie . Charlie touched the label . Underneath he felt the faint outline of a key , about the size of the one Duff had shown him . " Good work , Kashimo , " he murmured . In gold letters near the bag 's lock , he saw the initials " M. K. " P253AFTER a few whispered instructions to Kashimo , Charlie returned to the deck and stood by the rail , staring thoughtfully out at the silver path of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment was one of admiration for his assistant . An ingenious place to hide an object like a key  --  it had made but the slightest protuberance on the rough leather of the case . The eye would never have detected it  --  only the fingers . Yes , Kashimo was undoubtedly a blunderer , but in this matter of searching , of meddling with the property of others , the boy was touched with genius . Gradually Chan began to consider the larger aspects of the matter . How came this key , duplicate of the one found in the dead hand of Hugh Morris Drake that morning in a London hotel , to be on Kennaway 's bag ? Of course he had not seen it , but Charlie felt it safe to assume that it was the duplicate . The one Welby had located the night he told Pamela Potter : " The fun 's all over . " The fun had indeed been over for poor Welby . A dangerous object to discover . Where had Welby found it ? In the same place where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the label of the Great Eastern Hotel , Calcutta , and the natural inference must be that it had been put there in the Indian city . A man could n't pick up a Calcutta label anywhere save in Calcutta . Yes , it must have been in its present position in Yokohama , where Welby found it Wait a minute . Welby had spoken of this key toP254the girl as though he had actually seen it . Nurnber and all . But had he ? Perhaps he was merely assuming , as Chan was doing , that this was the duplicate key . It would have been a natural assumption . It might be that he had only run his fingers over the outline , as Chan had done . And some one had learned of his discovery , had followed him ashore and murdered him . Who ? Kennaway ? Nonsense . It had without doubt been the same man who killed Honywood and his wife . Kennaway was a mere boy ; what concern could he have with Jim Everhard and the Honywoods . With events that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then remained in the shadows for many years ? Charlie put his hand to his head . Puzzles , puzzles . It could n't have been Kennaway . The murderer 's settledpolicy , evidently , was to implicate innocent men if he could . Witness the matter of the strap in London , the theft of the rubber tip from the stick belonging to Ross . Furthermore , he would hardly care to have this key discovered in his possession . What more natural than for him to attach it to the property of another man ? Who would have had the best opportunity to put that key on Kennaway 's bag ? Chan 's eyes , fixed unseeing on the glittering water , narrowed suddenly . Who but Tait ? Tait , who had been so prompt that morning to proclaim himself an innocent man , who had asserted that his change to a wrist-watch had been effected before the tour started . Tait , who had slept in the room next to that in which Drake died ; Tait , who had fallen in a terrific heart attack when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to kill , wasMAXY MINCHIN 'S PARTY 255p255still alive . Certainly Tait was old enough to have been Everhard in his day , to have acquired those little bags of pebbles , to have carried them for years , determined to return them when opportunity offered . What more likely than that Tait had made use of his companion 's suitcase ? Chan began a slow stroll about the deck . No , the key was never Kennaway 's . Suddenly he stood still . If Welby had found it where it was now , and it did not belong to Kennaway , then the little detective from ScotlandYard had not discovered the murderer . Why , then , had he been killed on the Yokohama dock ? Again Chan put his hand to his head . " Haie , I wander amid confusing fog , " he murmured . " Much better I go to my pillow , seeking to gain clarity for the morrow . " He took his own advice at once , and the second night aboard the President Arthur passed without incident . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant considerable moving about , for the young man seemed restless and distraught . He roamed the ship , and Charlie roamed with him . " You are youthful person , " the Chinese remarked . " You should study calm . I should say to look at you you have few more than twenty years . " " Twenty-five , " Kennaway informed him . " But I seem to have added about ten by this tour . " " It has been difficult time ? " inquired Chan sympathetically . " Ever been a nurse maid ? " asked the young man . " Lord  --  if I 'd known what I was letting myself in for ! I 've read aloud at night until my eyes ached and my throat felt like the desert 's dusty face . Then there'sp256been the constant anxiety about poor Mr. Tait 's condi-tion . " " There have been other attacks since the one iri Broome 's Hotel ? " Charlie suggested . Kennaway nodded . " Yes , several . One on the boat in the Red Sea , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son to meet us at San Franciso , and believe me I 'll be glad to see that Golden Gate . If I can get him ashore there still alive , I 'll consider that I 'm a fool for luck . I 'll heave a sigh of relief that will be reported in all the Eastern papers as another Californiaearthquake . " " Ah , yes , " agreed Chan . " You must have been under much strain . " " Oh , I had it coming to me , " Kennaway returned gloomily . " I should have started to practise law and let the map of the world alone . Noft : ohc may people in Boston were in favor of this trip . They warned me . But I knew it all . " " Boston , " repeated Charlie . " As I told you yesterday , a city in which I have great interest . The diction of its people is most superior . Some years ago I did small favor for Boston family , and never in my life was I thanked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must have been something , " he replied . " A great deal , " Chan assured him . " I am oldfashionedperson who feels that choice of words proclaimsthe gentleman . Or , in the case of which I speak , the lady . My children regard me old fogy on this point . " " Children do n't show their parents enough respect these days , " the young man nodded . " I say that as anMAXY MINCHIN 'S PARTY 25ip251ex-child . Well , I hope my parents do n't find out the hell I 've been through on this trip . I 'd hate to hear the familiar : I told you so . ' Of course , it has n't been only poor Mr. Tait . I 've had other troubles . " " I do not wish to penetrate any Boston reserve , " Charlie remarked . " But could you name one , please ? " " I certainly could . That Potter girl  --  well , perhaps I should n't have said it . " Chan 's eyes opened in surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired . " Everything , " returned the young man . " She annoysme beyond words . " " Annoys you ? " " Yes . I 've said it , and I 'll stick to it . Does n't she get on your nerves too ? So damned Middle Western and competent ? So sure of herself ? She 's got more poise than a great-aunt of mine who 's lived on Beacon Hill for eighty-one years and met everybody worth while . "  --  He leaned closer . " You know , I actually believe the girl thinks I 'll propose to her before this tour 's over . Would I take that chance ? Not I. And get her bank-book thrown in my face . " " You think that would happen ? " " I 'm sure of it . I know these Middle Westerners  --  nothing matters but money . How much have you got ? We do n't feel that way in Boston . Money does n't count there . Ours certainly does n't . Uncle Eldred lost it all betting on the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know why I 've said all this to you . But you can see how I feel . Worn out acting as a nurse maid  --  and this girl on my mind all the time . " " Ah  --  then she is on your mind ? " " She certainly is . She can be mighty nice when shep258tries . Sweet , and  --  er  --  you know , sweet  --  and then all at once I 'm run over by an automobile . One of the Drake brand . Millions at the wheel . " Chan consulted his watch . " I see her now at far end of deck . I presume you wish to flee ? " Kennaway shook his head . " What 's the use ? You ca n't get away from people on a boat . I 've given up trying , long ago . " Pamela Potter came up to them . " Good morning , Mr. Chan . Hello , Mark . How about some deck tennis ? I think I can trim you this morning . " " You always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so effete , " she smiled , and led the captiveKennaway off . Chan made a hasty tour of the deck . He found Captain Ronald Keane seated alone near the bow of the boat , and dropped into a chair beside him . " Ah , Captain , " he said , " a somewhat gorgeous morn-ing . " " I guess it is , " Keane replied . " Had n't noticed , really . " " You have other matters that require pondering ? " Charlie suggested . " Not a thing in the world , " yawned Keane . " But I never pay any attention to the weather . People who do are nothing but human vegetables . " The chief engineer came strolling along the deck . He paused at Charlie 's chair . " About time for our tour of the engine room , Mr. Chan , " he remarked . " Ah , yes , " returned the Chinese . " You were kind enough to promise me that pleasure when we talked together last night . Captain Keane , I am sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiringly at Keane.  |p259The  captain stared back , amazed . " Me ? Oh , no , thanks . I 've no interest in engines . Would n't know a gadget from a gasket . And care less . " Charlie glanced up at the engineer . " Thank you so much , " he said . " If you do not object , I will postponemy own tour . I desire short talk with Captain Keane . " " All right , " nodded the engineer , and moved away . Chan was regarding Keane grimly . " You know nothing about engines ? " he suggested . " Certainly not . What are you getting at , anyhow ? " " Some months ago , in parlor of Broome 's Hotel , London , you informed Inspector Duff you were onetime engineer . " Keane stared at him . " Say , you 're quite a lad , are n't you ? " he remarked . " Did I tell Duff that ? I 'd forgot all about it . " " It was not the truth ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first thing that came into my head . " " A habit of yours , it seems . " " What do you mean by that ? " " I have been reading about you , Captain Keane . In Inspector Duff 's note-book . Investigation of murder is serious business , and you will pardon me if I get plenty crude in my remarks . You are self-confessed liar , seemingly with no regrets . All through tour you have behaved strangely , listening outside doors . Not very lovable activity . " " No , I fancy it is n't , " Keane snapped . " You must have found that out in your own work . " " I am not sneaky kind of detective , " replied Chan , with dignity.  | " Is that so ? " replied Keane . " Then you ca n't be much good . I 've been in the business six years , and I 'm not proud of what I 've done . " Charlie sat up . " You are detective ? " he asked . Keane nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I represent a private agency in San Francisco " Ah  --  private detective , " nodded Chan , relieved . " Yes , and do n't be nasty . We 're just as good as you are . I 'm telling you this because I do n't want you to waste your time on me . Mrs. Spicer has a husband and he 's eager to get rid of her . Wants to marry a movie actress , or something like that . So he sent me on this trip to see what I could see . " Chan studied Keane 's mean face carefully . Was this the truth ? The man certainly looked well-suited to the role of private detective . So he did n't want Chan to waste any time on him ? Unexpected consideration , this was . " You have had no success ? " the Chinese remarked . " No  --  the thing was a flop from the first . I believe Vivian suspected me the moment he saw me . I dread meeting Spicer when we land at San Francisco  --  all this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fault if love 's young dream blew up right in my face . If they only had n't been partners at bridge  --  that finished it . They 're not even speaking now , and Vivian has threatened to break my neck if I come near him again . I 'm fond of my neck . So I 'm at a loose end from here on home . By the way , all this is on the quiet . " Charlie nodded . " Your secret is safe with me . " " I was wondering , " continued Keane . " Could n't 1p261help you out on this murder thing ? Is there any reward , or anything . like that ? " " The reward of work well done , " Charlie replied . " Tripe ! You do n't mean to say you 've come into this without having an understanding with the Potter girl ? Say  --  you need a manager . I 'll go and have a talk with her . The family 's got wads of money , and they naturally want to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-fifty " Stop ! " cried Chan . " You have already said too much . Kindly remember that I am not private detective . You have no authority from me for your low plan -- - " " Wait a minute . Let 's argue this out --  " " No . The ignorant are never defeated in argument . What is more , there is nothing to debate . You will kindly keep out of this affair , which does not concern you in the least . I am bidding you good day . " " You 're a hell of a business man , " growled Keane . Charlie walked rapidly down the deck , his accustomed calm rudely disturbed . What a worm this fellow Keane was ! All that about being a private detective  --  was it true ? Possibly . On the other hand , it might be merely a blind , a tall story designed to put Charlie off his guard . Charlie sighed . Must n't forget Keane . Must n't forget any of them . The creaking ship plowed on its way , making good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on Kennaway 's bag . Long , leisurely talks with one member of the party after another yielded no result . The second day passed , and the third night . Not until the fourth night did Charlie begin to take hope again . It was on that evening that Maxy Minchin entertained  --  a grand party to celebrate the approaching end of the tour . Maxy had passed about with his invitations and had been , much to his own surprise , cordially received . Familiarity had bred charity where he was concerned . The long weeks together had led the party to overlookhis crudities . As Mrs. Luce put it : " We must n't forget there 's some one in this crowd who 's even worse than Mr. Minchin . " Every one accepted , and Maxy was delighted . When he brought the news to his wife she reminded him that , with Lofton , there would be thirteen at table . " Do n't let 's take any chances , Maxy , " she said . " You been gettin ' all the - breaks so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to find a fourteenth . " Mr. Minchin found the fourteenth in Charlie . " I ai n't got nothing against the dicks , " he explained to the Chinese . " I give a party once in Chicago for a table full of ' em . One of the nicest feeds I ever pulled off . You come along . Informal . I 'm leaving my Tux in the trunk . " " Thank you so much , " Chan answered . " Arid may I hope that you will not be offended if at this dinner I make bold to refer to the subject of murder ? " " I do n't get you , " said Maxy , startled . " I mean I have unlimited yearning to mention there the unfortunate fate of Hugh Morris Drake in Broome 's Hotel . It would make me happy to hear conversation regarding this affair from one and all . " Maxy frowned . " Well , I do n't know about that . I was hopin ' we was n't going to talk business . Just a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some guy in this gang 's got a lot on his mind , and Ip263would n't like him to have no anxious minutes while he 's my guest . After that , you can put the cuffs on him any minute  --  see what I mean ? He ai n't no pal of mine . But for the one evening " I will be discreet , " Chan promised . " No questions , of course . " Maxy waved his hand . " Well , have it your own way . Start the murder thing if you want to . They 's no tags to my bids . It 's Liberty Hall when Maxy Minchin is paying the check . " Liberty Hall turned out to be the deck cafe , where fourteen people sat down that evening around a lavishly decorated table . Knowing full well his duties as a sea-going host , Mr. Minchin had provided a comic hat for every one . He himself put on a Napoleonic tricorn with a scarlet cockade , and thus equipped , felt that the evening had begun auspiciously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And drink the same . It 's all on the house . I told ' em to put out the best they got . " After the coffee , Maxy rose . " Well , here we are , " he began , " near the end of the big hop . We seen the world together , and we had good times , and some not so good . Take it all and all , I 'll say it 's been a swell lay-out from the start . And if you 're asking nee , we had one dandy guide . Lift your glasses , people . To old Doc Lofton , the grandest guy afloat . " There were cries for a speech and Lofton arose , somewhat embarrassed . " Thank you , friends , " he said . " I have been conductingparties like this for many years , and I want to say that this has been in many ways one of my more  --  er  --  memorable experiences . You have given me very little trouble  --  this is , of course  --  most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been amicably settled . You have all been most reasonable , sometimes under great strain , and I am grateful . Of course , I would be foolish to overlook the fact that our tour began under very unusual and trying circumstances . If Miss Pamela will forgive me , I am referring to the unfortunate passing of  --  er  --  her grandfather that midnightat Broome 's Hotel in London . That is to say , between midnight and morning  --  er  --  an occurrence that I regret more deeply than any of you  --  with , of course , the exception of the young lady I have mentioned . But that is now long in the past , and it seems best to forget it . If it remains among the unsolved mysteries , we must accept that as the will of fate . I shall land you all in San Francisco very soon , and we shall part "  --  his manner brightened noticeably  --  " but I assure you that I shall always treasure memories of our companionship . " " Hear , hear , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite applause . " Well , folks , since the Doc 's brought it up , I may say that we 're all sorry about that kick-off at Broome 's . And that brings me at this time to mention our special guest here to-night  --  the Chinese dick from Hawaii . Believe me , people , I seen all kinds , but this is a new one on me . Mr. Chan , spill a few words . " Charlie rose with dignity , despite his introduction . He glanced calmly about the little room . " The drum which makes the most noise is filled with wind , " he said . " I remember this in time so I will not obtrude myself . But I welcome opportunity to bow to my gracious host , and to his delightful lady , obscuredMAXY MINCHIN 'S PARTY 265p265with plenty jewels . Fate is capricious stage manager . She has introduced you to policemen round the world . To my distinguished friend from Scotland Yard , to the officers of France and Italy . Now you get sample from melting-pot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on humble Chinese who follows meager clues left behind by the few criminals who infestour paradise . " I stand here before you in not entirely happy position . Wise man has said , do not follow on the heels of a sorrow , or it may turn back . . Such would be my own advice to Miss Pamela . But while I remain thus in upright posture , old sorrow will not fade from your minds . " You must recall that had it not occurred , I would not be here . You see pictures of Broonie 's Hotel , old incidents , now long forgotten , come back to you . It can happen they take on new meaning after extensive absence . I am desolate to know I recall these things , and I make haste to erase myself . First I would add  --  Doctor Lofton has told you that i f matter is never solved , it is will of fate . I am Chinese , I accept will of fate , but I have lived so long among American people I feel inclination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance . By this time my broad bulk has cast plently shade on this gay feast . I am sitting down . " Mr. Minchin 's roving eye fell on Mr. Tait . That gentleman rose with the manner of the experienced speaker . " I am , perhaps , happier than any of you to be here , " he began . " There have been tines when it seemed I must leave you long before this . But the determina- tion to live is strong , and I promise that I shall finish with you , as I began . " In many ways , I feel that I am lucky . I have much to be grateful for . For example , referring again to my friend Mr. Hugh Morris Drake , and the night of February sixth  --  the morning of the seventh  --  I might have been the occupant of the bed in room 28  --  the innocent victim of a murder that was purely -- He stopped , and looked helplessly about him . " Par- , don me . I am off on the wrong tack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather unhappy evening for the charming Miss Pamela . I only meant to say that I am happy to have survived thus far on our tour around the world , and that it has been a great pleasure to meet you all . Thank you very much . " He sat down abruptly amid subdued applause . Mrs. Luce obliged with a travelogue , and Pamela Potter said a few graceful words . Captain Keane arose . " Well , it 's been a great trip , " he said . " However , I guess it 's about over now , and those of us who have work to do can go and do it . We 've had a lot of fun , and for my part I 'd almost forgotten the incident at Broome 's Hotel . That was a bit of a strain , and no mistake . Inspector Duff acted for a while as though he intended to spoil the tour  --  for some of us at least . His questions were pretty personal . I do n't go in for murder myself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may recall . I had my bad moments . And I guess some of the rest of us were on the anxious seat , too . I guess Mr. Elmer Benbow was a little bit worried  --  eh , Mr. Benbow ? I have n't said a word to anybody about this before , but now we 're all back inGod 's country and I guess we can take care of our-  |p267selves.  1 saw Mr. Benbow at three o'clock the morning of the murder , just as he was slipping back into his room from the hall . I imagine you 're glad you did n't have to explain that to Scotland Yard  --  eh , Benbow ? " Keane 's air was one of light-hearted banter , but it deceived no one . Underneath was a cheap malice that was unpleasant to contemplate . Even Maxy Minchin , though he could n't have defined the feeling , knew that here was an exhibition of bad taste that took the palm . The little gangster leaped to his feet . " The way things is going you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benbow , you been elected the next speaker . " The man from Akron got slowly to his feet . " I 've been doing a lot of speaking the past few years , " he began , " but I do n't know that I ever had to make a speech like this before . It 's quite true  --  I was out of my room that night at Broome 's Hotel . After we got home and got to bed , I suddenly remembered that February sixth was my daughter 's birthday . We 'd been intending all day to send her a cable , but we 'd been so busy we both forgot . Well , I was upset , and no mistake . Then I remembered the change of time  --  that it was six hours earlier in Akron . It came to me that maybe I could still get my cable to her that day  --  late at night , perhaps , but still on her birthday . I jumped out of bed , dressed , and hustled out . There were some scrubwomen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other servants , coming or going . Of course , I should have told the police about this , but I certainly did n't feel like getting mixed up in the affair . It was a foreign country  --  different -- you know how it is . If I 'd been at home  --  well , I 'd have told the chief of police all about it . But England . Scotland Yard . I got cold feet . " I 'm glad Captain Keane brought the matter up here to-night . I 'm glad to explain the thing , and I hope you believe me . Now  --  er  --  I had a speech ready , but it 's clean gone . Oh , yes  --  one thing I do remember . I 've been taking pictures all the way around , as I guess you know . You 're all in ' em . I bought a projector in Honolulu and Friday night  --  our last night aboard  --  well , Mrs. Benbow and I are entertaining then . We want you all to be our guests , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's  --  that 's about all , now . " He sat down amid loud and friendly applause . Several rebuking looks were cast at Keane , who receivedthem nonchalantly . Mr. Minchin rose again . " I guess it 's up to me to make the next selection , " he remarked . " Mr. Ross , we ai n't heard from you yet . " Ross stood up , and leaned heavily on his stick . " I have no belated accusations to offer , " he remarked , and a little round of applause circled the table . " All I can say is , this has been an interesting tour . I 've been looking forward to it for many years  --  how many , I would n't like to tell you . It has been somewhat more exciting than I 'd bargained for , but I have no regrets . I 'm glad I came on this party with Doctor Lofton  --  and with all of you . I only wish I had been as wise as Mr. Benbow and made a record of my experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tacoma . As for that unfortunate night in London , when poor Hugh Morris Drake lay dead in that stuffy room in Broome 's Hotel , with Doctor Lofton 's luggage strap about his throat Suddenly from far down the table , Vivian spoke .   " Who says it was Doctor Lofton 's luggage strap ? " he demanded bruskly . Ross hesitated . " Why  --  why  --  I understood at the inquest , " he replied , " that it was taken from the doctor 's closet " We 're all telling our real names to-night , " went on Vivian in a clear , cool voice . " That was n't Lofton 's luggage strap . In point of fact , it was n't a luggage strap at all . It was a camera strap  --  the kind you use to carry a motion picture camera over your shoulder . And I happen to know that it was the property of Mr. Elmer Benbow . " With one accord they all turned and stared at Benbow , sitting with a stricken look on his face near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxy Minchin got slowly tohis feet . He removed the Napoleonic hat from his head , and with a gesture of abdication , cast it aside . " Well , you bimbos are certainly making some dinner out of this , " he remarked . " Sadie , I guess we never give one like it before , did we ? Way I figure it , guys that put on the feed-bag together ought to act nice and friendly at the table , even if they do pull a gat on the stairs going out . Still , I ai n't one to tell my guests how to behave . Mr. Benbow , you spoke once , but it looks to me like you got ta speak again . " Benbow leaped to his feet . The stricken look had faded , and he appeared grim and determined . " Well , " he said , " I guess I made a mistake . When I was telling you that about the cablegram to my daughter , it flashed through my mind I ought to say something about the strap " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Keane sneered . Benbow turned on him . " Captain Keane , I do n't know what I have done to win this hostility from you . I 've regarded you from the first as a cheap and contemptiblelight-weight , but I thought I had kept my opinion of you hidden . I did not send that strap to my girl as a birthday present . I wish I had . Then it would not have been put to the use it ultimately was . " He took a sip of water , and continued . " I heard about Mr. Drake 's murder early that next morning , andp271I went to his room to see if there was anything I could do . That 's what I would have done in Akron it seemed the neighborly and kindly thing . There was no one in the room at the moment but a hotel servant  --  the police had n't come . I went over and looked at Drake . I saw the strap about his throat , and I thought it was almighty like my camera strap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went to my room , hunted up my camera  --  and found that the strap was missing from the case . " Well , we talked it over , Nettie and I. Our door was always unlocked  --  I did n't like to go out and leave it that way , but the maid had requested us to do it . The camera had been there all the previous afternoon , as well as in the evening , when we went to the theater . It had been easy enough for somebody to slip in and get that strap . My wife suggested that I go and talk things over with Doctor Lofton . " . He looked at the doctor .  --  " I 'm going to tell the whole business , " he added . Lofton nodded . " By all means , " he remarked . " Well , the doctor pooh-poohed my fears at first , but when I told him I had been out the previous night to send that cablegram , he began to look serious . i asked him if he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also that I had been away from my room between two and three o'clock on the morning of the murder . Men have been hung on less than that . And there I was , in a strange country , first time I 'd ever been out of the good old United States , and  --  well , I was scared stiff . It looks like I leave your party here and now , ' I said to the doctor . He patted me on the shoulder . Say nothing , ' he told me . Leave every- thing to me . I 'm sure you did n't kill Drake , and I 'll do all I can to keep you out of the investigation . ' Believe me  --  it was a good offer . I took it . The next thing I heard about the strap , Doctor Lofton had claimed it as his own . That 's all I 've got to say . Oh , yes  --  Vivian asked me on the channel boat where my strap was . He asked in sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made some crack about it . I saw that he was on to the situation , but he did n't seem inclined to do anything about it . " For the first time in many moments , Chan spoke . He turned to Vivian with interest . " Is this true , sir ? " he inquired . " Yes , it is , " replied Vivian . " I knew from the first it was Benbow 's strap . But there we were , in a foreign country  --  and I did n't really think Benbow was guilty . I did n't know what to do . So I consulted the one man in our party who ought to know about such things . A celebrated criminal lawyer . Mr. Tait , I mean . I outlinedthe matter to him , and he advised me to say nothing . " " And now you disregard his advice ? " Charlie said . " Not precisely . He and I were speaking about it to-day , and he told me he thought it was about time to get to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he thought yours the best mind that had yet come into the case . " Chan bowed . " Mr. Tait does me too much honor , " he protested . " Well , there 's nothing more I can say , " Benbow went on , mopping his perspiring brow . " Doctor Loftonclaimed the strap , and that let me out . " He sat down . P273They all looked at Lofton . His manner showed that he was decidedly annoyed ; his eyes were flashing . " Everything that Mr. Benbow has told you is true , " he remarked . " But consider my position , if you will . There I was , with a murder in my party , and up against the most celebrated man-hunting organization in the world . My only object was to cut off their investigationat the earliest possible moment , and get out of England with my party intact . I felt that if Mr. Benbowadmitted those two damaging facts , he would certainly be held in London . One of them alone might not have sufficed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been too much . I saw myself losing at the very start of the tour a couple of my best clients . And I was morally certain Mr. Benbow was entirely innocent . " When the matter of the strap wad brought up by Inspector Duff , I saw my way out immediately . I had not left my room the night before , and no one could say I had . True , there had been a little matter of warm words between Mr. Drake and myself , but that meant nothing , as the inspector was quick to see . I was not connected with the crime in any way . The strap was not unlike one I had about an old bag  --  not quite so wide , but the same color , black . I told Duff I possessed a strap similar to the one he was showing me . I went to my room , removed it from my bag , and hid it beneath a wardrobe that reached nearly to the floor . If my plan failed , f could pretend to discover it there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went back to Drake 's room and told the inspector that I believed the strap used to strangle the old gentleman was mine . " It worked like a charm . From that point on theP274matter of the strap was of no further interest to ScotlandYard . Mr. Benbow was safe and " And so were you , " suggested Captain Keane , blowinga ring of smoke toward the ceiling . " I beg your pardon , sir , " glowered Lofton . " I say , Benbow was safe , and so were you , " Keane went on calmly . " If there had been any disposition on the part of Duff to suspect you of the crime , you rather took him aback by claiming that strap on the spot . He figured that if you 'd been guilty , you 'd hardly have committed the murder with your own strap , and then admitted the ownership immediately . Yes , my dear Doctor , it worked like a charm -- Lofton 's face was scarlet . " What the devil are you driving at " Oh , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying much . attention to you in this affair . There you were  --  broken-hearted because such a thing had happened on a tour of yours . But were you ? Might n't there have been something more important to you than your tour - " Lofton tossed aside his chair , and strode over to where Keane sat . " Stand up , " he cried . " Stand up , you dirty cur . I 'm an old man , but by heaven " Gentlemen , gentlemen , " shouted Maxy Minchin . " Remember they 's ladies present . " Charlie inserted his great bulk between Doctor Lof ton and the captain . " Let the refreshing breeze of reason blow over this affair , " he suggested gently . " Doctor Lofton , you are foolish man to listen to unresponsible talk of this plenty flippant person . He has no basisP275whatever for evil insinuations . " He took the doctor by the arm and led him a few feet away . " Well , folks , " announced Maxy Minchin , " I guess the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join hands and sing Auld Lang Syne at the finish , but mebbe we better chop that . Open the doors . An ' for the sake of my boy at school , I hope they wo n't be no rods drawn in the hallway . " Chan quickly escorted Lofton outside . Behind him , as he left , he heard the scraping of chairs , the breaking up of Maxy 's interesting dinner party . " Hot words will cool here on windy deck , " he suggested . " Accepting my advice , you will abstain from presence of Keane until you feel less fiery . " " Yes , I fancy I 'd better , " the doctor admitted . " I 've hated that sneering whelp from the moment I saw him . But of course , I must n't forget my position . " He gave Charlie a searching look . " I was happy to hear you say that he had no basis for his accusations . " " None whatever that I discover , " answered Chan blandly . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a rather silly move , my claiming that strap . I ca n't explain it except for the fact that after you 've traveled with groups like this for a few years , you begin to look upon them as children . Somewhat stupid children , too , helpless and needing protection . My first instinct is always to furnish the protection . One of my people was in trouble so , as had happened many times before , I simply shifted his burden to my own shoulders , and carried on . " Charlie nodded . " I understand plenty well , " he reassuredthe older man.
