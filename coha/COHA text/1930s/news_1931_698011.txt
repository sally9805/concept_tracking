txt Doubtless mankind could achieve something finer than blueberry pie , but doubtless mankind never will . To what can it be compared ? To the honey in the honeycomb ? To a bank of wild thyme ? In the realm of idealization , unlike things are all the same . But blueberry pie shows its true colors ( which are blue on the bush though black in the mouth ) by comparison with its natural kitchen rivals . Compare it , for instance , to that effete , magenta delicacy , the strawberry shortcake -- a spongy space-filler , usually demoralized by a deluge of whipped cream . Strawberry shortcake is better than raspberry shortcake , which , in turn , is better than peach shortcake . But strawberry shortcake lacks the stamina of blueberry pie . Blueberry pie has strength as well as beauty . The blueberry is a noble fruit , celestial jelly wrapped in a heavenhued filament . All over the country , on the upland pastures and in scraggly woods , pickers are silently kneeling to the bush . It is a hot and sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burns ; the flies bite . Nothing looks more cavernous than an empty pail in the morning . The first tiny berries give off a mocking tink as they drop into the bottom of the bucket . Only the knowledge that pails have been filled in the past encourages the picker to believe that pails can still be filled in the present . Whoever began the tradition that pails must be filled must have been a vexing neighbor . That tradition has resolved blueberry-picking into torment of the flesh . Your good name in the neighborhood is at stake . Folks will talk . Even clean pickers who do woman 's work in the field by excluding the leaf , feel that they must come home with a ten-quart pail full , and generally remark that they could have filled another if they had thought to take one . Solitary pickers may slip home with a pail half filled ; there are no records of solitary pickers .

In the vicinity of flour , lard and baking-powder a blueberry changes from an esthetic to a sensuotm organism . " Reciipes for a Contented Nation " gives the formula as follows : " Line a deep " plate with . paste . and fill it with " berries slightly dredged with flour ; " sprinkle with one-half cup sugar " and one-eighth teaspoon salt ; " cover and bake forty to forty-five " minutes over a slow fire . " Nothing is said in this recipe about lattice crusts , which are an abomination and offense to heaven . Nor Is there anything to indicate that three Mite must be made in the centre of the crust to let the spirit of blueberries rise free in the oven . But the rest is easy . Let the pie cool to the temperature of the room . Serve in wedges , letting the rich liquor run around the bottom of the plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while father spoons up the residue .
