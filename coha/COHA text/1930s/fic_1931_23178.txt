ON THE WAGON A STORY BY MARGARET CULKIN BANNING O NCE again Katie Casey had been drunk and disorderly . She woke to a diffused memory of having taken the drink she knew was one too many , which had led to other drinks that she had been too exhilarated to count . She knew that she must have been very noisy . She had talked back to the policeman , and that had really made the trouble . Vaguely she began to recall that she had refused to go home , that quite a crowd of people had been watching , and that she 'd had a terrible fight with Pat . Slowly and unwelcomed these memories of having affronted her friends and the public and the law came back to her . It was a messy recollection , not clear in detail and entirely depressing . She felt as if the opening of her eyes made her head black and blue . However , there was nothing to do but face the day and whatever consequences it might have in waiting , so she pressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long in coming . " Good morning , Miss Katherine , " she said . " There 's no chance that it will be a good morning , Alma , " answered Katie , " but thanks for the wish . Is this clock right ? " " Yes , Miss Katherine . It 's nearly noon . " " Who 's telephoned ? " asked Katie , and it was characteristic that she did not ask if anyone had . That was assumed . " Mr. Ames said to tell you he 'd called . And Mr. Patrick Wheeler wanted to know if you would lunch with him at the Town Club at one-thirty . " " How forgiving of him , " murmured Katie . " And Miss Everman telephoned about ten minutes ago . " " Sally 's up , is she ? She would be , " said Katie , " she 's got lots of news to spread to-day . " Alma knew that these comments were not for her . They were asides , thoughts in the O'Neill manner . " Will you have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What would you like ? " Katie sat up and reached for an extra covering of pale-blue silk that lay on the nearest chair . Her dark hair was completely undisciplined , and she had not taken off her lip rouge when she went to bed , but she looked the prettier for those reasons and for the traces of fatigue around her violet eyes . The shadows of weariness made them seem mysterious and somewhat pathetic , which was better luck than they deserved . " I want something cold and some black coffee and no nourishment , " she said , " no toast . I 'm far too frail for toast . You know , Alma . " Alma knew . She very much admired Katie 's awakenings . When she went to motion pictures with her young man it sometimes gave her a thrill to see the stars waking to tragedy or romance in beds that looked like Katie 's , in similar ensembles of silk and linen and down . Alma had a histrionic sense which Katie satisfied . " I 'll bring your tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katie 's mind was clearing rapidly and she knew that there should have been another call . " Nobody telephoned without leaving a name or anything ? " " Only a woman who wanted to see you about an exhibit of clothes . " " All right , thank you . Oh , Alma , plug this telephone in before you go downstairs , will you , please ? " She put the other pillow on the bed behind her and checked up . So he had n't even bothered to call up , as he 'd said he would . Probably he was disgusted . He 'd certainly been very agreeable and devoted during the first part of the evening . He was a very attractive person , that John Murray , when he wanted to be . Of course he might he more or less of a prig , like Ford Ames , who was always giving advice away . Poor Ford must have had a bad time last night . The telephone call from him this morning had undoubtedly been another effort to make her stop drinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it anyway . I 'm going on the wagon , thought Katie . That 's what I 'm going to do . And in the same moment she saw a mental picture of herself at the next party  --  probably in that new green chiffon  --  refusing to take a small silver goblet from a tray . " No , thanks , " she could hear herself say casually . Everybody would be astonished . They would all get quite excited . John Murray would glance at her in that appraising , amused way he had . He looked as if he 'd seen a lot of girls and could decide about them without taking advice . I 'll surprise him , reflected Katie . He 'll imagine that I 'm always the way I was last night . At that point curiosity as to just how she had been became very strong . She lifted the white telephone from its stand and gave the operator a number . " Is Miss Everman there ? " she asked after the necessary interval , and almost immediately , " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed quick in identification , either because of the voice or the description . The conversation proseeded . " Was I as bad as all that ? " asked Katie . " Well , I knew I should n't have taken that fourth cocktail . You ca n't be sure of what 's in the things any more . Now Fernando used to be able to mix them so that they never seemed to have an effect like that . I 'm frightfully sorry if I ruined the evening for everybody . . . . Oh , was I really so funny ? I do n't suppose John Murray thought so . When did he go home ? Was that before I got in wrong with the policeman ? . . . Just before ? Of course I remember the whole thing . As a matter of fact , no policeman has any right to be as fussy as that at that hour of the night . Even if I was speeding a little I was perfectly in control of the car . " Sally had something to say on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that was no reason for letting him , " replied Katie , " and that policeman was awfully ill-tempered . When you think of how corrupt the police force is . .. . I know I told him all about it . I meant to . It must have been quite a sight when we all trailed into the police station with Pat so merry and Ford so righteous . Was it Ford who fixed things up ? I must find out what it cost him . And who finally drove me home ? " Her friend told her and added a few other details . " I thought that judge , or chief of police , or whoever he was , was sweet , " said Katie . " I do n't remember exactly what he told me but I 'm sure it was what every girl should know . I can just remember his fat face staring at me . His glasses were n't in the right place over his eyes . . . Oh , did I tell him so ? I seem to have kept nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have n't talked to Pat , but he called up and asked me to lunch at the Town Club to-day so he 's in the forgive-and-forget fraternity . I did n't say anything too terrible to him , did I ? Of course I may have pointed out one or two of his faults . It 's just as well . It 's my last chance , because I 'm swearing off . Going on the wagon . . . . No , really . I 'm absolutely off the stuff . It is n't worth it . I 'm not going to take a thing . . . Well , I certainly do mean it ! You wait and see . Here 's my breakfast , Sally . I 'll have to ring off . Good-by . Tell the truth about me when they ask you . " There was a large glass of very cold orange juice and a small silver coffeepot and two thin slices of toast after all . Katie did not resent them . She ate them both thoughtfully . Then she called up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheeler that Miss Casey would meet him at the Town Club at one-thirty and got up to see what a cold shower would do to her memories , regrets , and resolves . She did not look dissipated when she went into the Town Club an hour and a half later . She was wearing a crepe de chine suit of the color that some dressmaker with imagination had called shell pink , and an innocent-seeming matching hat , which turned back ingenuously from her forehead and demurely down over her ears . It was Pat who displayed signs of wear . He was thin and blond and , as Katie had once remarked , every spot showed up on him . To-day be looked tired and in need of either rest or stimulus . " Hello , " he said , " I should n't be speaking to you but I am . Did you mean those things you said to me or did you have some other fellow in mind ? " " What things do you mean ? " " I do n't remember exactly but I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat ? " " Let 's edge down to that nearest card-room , " he said . " There 's no one in there , and I 'll get you your favorite Bacardi . And then how about some brook trout ? Mattson saysit 's good to-day . " " The trout 's a grand idea . I adore it the way they fix it with almonds . But no cocktails , thanks . " " No cocktails ? Why not ? " " Oh , I 've just stopped . " " Stopped drinking ? " " All but the softest beverages . " " Do n't be silly , " answered Pat , " you were all right . You do n't want to take last night as seriously as all that . I did n't mind what you said to me . Come along . You 'd better have something quick if you 're as low as all that . " " No . I do n't want it . I 'm really going on the wagon , Pat . I 'm on it now . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew his head must ache . " You go ahead and have one yourself if you like , Pat . I 'll wait for you upstairs . I 'll eat an olive and wait for you , or botanize on celery . " " I do n't see why you 're acting like this . Who 's been after you ? Has Ford Ames been preaching ? " " Nobody 's been after me . Ford certainly could n't tell me what to do . I just decided myself . " She suddenly looked very detached and indifferent . For John Murray was coming along the hall where they were talking , and she preferred not to notice him until be was close upon her . He was a noticeable person , tall , ugly in an interesting way and with a manner which seemed to suggest that he was not in the room . Instead she under no conditions or circumstances saw a number of her friends and her would he tell everything he knew . critics , and among them Ford Ames , " Oh , Murray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and some news . What do you suppose ? " other elderly woman . His expression " What do I suppose ? " Murray changed at the sight of Katie , and he stopped , but as if he did n't intend to Left his table almost immediately to linger . " How are you to-day , Katie ? come over to the one by the window You look almost as if you had a soul . " which Pat had reserved . " I have a very beautiful soul , " she " Did you know that I called you up said . " You 've never seen it . " this morning , Katie ? " " But do you know what she says ? " Alma told me when I woke up . " She says she 's stopped drinking . " " I just wanted to be sure that you Murray remained unexcited. were all right . You 're looking lovely . " " Have you , Katie ? " he asked rhetor She smiled up at him , though she ically . " Pat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around anywhere ? I 've a bunch of whole life . " You must tell me about engineers coming on from Pittsburgh that fine you paid for me last night . and I want him to get up a good dinner . How much was it ? " He can do it if he tries .

" " Until Pat draws the chair from " What should I think ? " answered under you , " she said . Murray . " Oh , there 's my victim . He sat down and regarded her See you later . " gravely . One of the things that Ford He went off to intercept the club did best was to show that he had steward , and Katie looked after him principles and ideals . They were very though she did n't want to . She felt becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give up deep-set eyes .

Apparently it had made no " How much do I owe you for keepimpression on him . ing me out of jail ? " she persisted . " Come on , Katie , " urged Pat , " you " You do n't owe me anything .

You might have been a woman of the streets from the way he acted ! That fellow 's certainly going to lose his job if I can fix it . " Katie stared . " How perfectly ridiculous , Ford ! " she exclaimed . " You would n't do anything as absurd and unjust as that . He was just doing his duty . Why should n't he have arrested me ? I was probably galloping along at seventy miles an hour . " " All of that . We all might have been killed . And you would n't let me drive . " " Oh , we were safe enough . I drive with the part of me that does n't get drunk . " " The whole thing was pretty bad . Honestly , Katie , I 've thought about nothing else all day  --  d nothing but you . " Katie saw nothing out of the way in that method of spending a day but she did not praise him for it . Instead she said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I do n't . When I think of a girt like you , with the character I know you really have underneath , letting yourself in for situations like that one last night , it disturbs me terribly . I wish you 'd stop drinking altogether . " " Altogether ? " " Is n't that the best way ? I really do n't think it would be so difficult . " " Not difficult at all . As it happens , I 've already done it . " He stared and then his open astonishment changed to the glance that so many girls wished they could get from him . " You mean that you 're cutting out alcohol entirely ? " " I shall stick to tomato juice , " she said , " and possibly pop . I 've always had a real fancy for pop . " " You do n't think this is just an impulse ? " " I do n't know . It feels like a firm determination . There does n't seem to be a crack or a soft spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years that means as much to me , Katie . " " Funny . It was n't you that was doing the drinking . You 're a one-highballed man . " " It 's because you mean so much to me . You do n't know how much I care about everything that concerns you . This makes me sure that we really have the same standards . " " I would n't count on that , " she warned him , but he paid no attention . He was beaming proudly on her . " I know it 's not going to be a simple thing to do , " he told her , " with all the liquor there is around and most of your friends drinking it . " " That 's my problem . " " I 'd like to help you with it . I wish you 'd promise me not to let anyone argue you into changing your mind . " " Oh , let 's not make it as personal as all that . " " But it is personal with me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of people do n't understand you , Katie . This morning John Murray was talking to me and he said ? " He was interrupted . Pat was at his elbow . " Who 's sitting in my chair ? " he asked . Ford stood up . He always met jocosity rather stiffly . " I was just filling in the time until you came , Pat . My mother 's over there . I must go back . Good-by , Katie . " He went , and with him went the rest of the quotation about what John Murray had said that morning , presumably about her . Not for worlds would Katie have detained him to remind him that the sentence had been unfinished . But curiosity steamed in her , kept hot by a rather angry imagination . So John Murray talked about her to other men . What did he know about her anyway ? He had n't been in the city six months , and just because he 'd been invited about a lot and had that savor of romance which mining engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought he could gossip too , did he ? He had n't seen her more than a dozen times . He did n't know in the least what she was like ! She 'd never shown him . It was rotten taste to talk about her . He was cheap to do it . A decent man who 'd seen a girl drink a little too much did n't go around talking about it the next day . And how was she to find out what he 'd said ? " I told you you 'd be cross if you did n't have a cocktail , " said Pat . " I 'm not cross . " " You looked as if murder was your idea of a merciful act . All the wild Irish was sticking out of you . You might have been looking at your favorite policeman . " Pat was feeling much better himself . Katie could see that as far as he was concerned the colors of the world had brightened and its movement become faster since he 'd had a drink . But things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very shortly guessed it . " You 're not going to like it , you know , " he said shrewdly . " Like what ? My lunch ? " " This state of salvation you 're going in for . " " Oh , I may . " " There 's not a chance . It 's a much more cheerful world with a little stick in it . And that 's what you 're used to . " " I 'll get along all right . " " You 'll break my heart . What am I going to do when I 'm lit and you 're sober ? Who 's going to play with me ? " " I can still do that . " " Who 's going to fight with me ? " " I 'll do that too . " " The fire will go out of you . I tell you , Katie , you want to sleep on this idea of reform . " " I did sleep until noon . And my mind seemed all made up when I came to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what the alcoholic content of your life has been . " " That 's what I want to find out . " " Wo n't you even drink champagne at our wedding ? " " I have n't promised you any wedding . " " No  --  but I 've been hinting for one . Say , Katie , you are n't going to get so sober that you 'll take up with an oyster like Ames , are you ? " " How can I tell ? " " You 've got to promise me ? " " I wo n't promise anybody anything , " she said , decidedly . He sighed fondly at her . " A grand fighter like you ca n't keep up your strength on tea . It is n't that I want you drunk , Katie . I just want you merry . " She knew all about that . It was always the reason . There had to be gaiety , and often it seemed impossible to get it , to be sure of it , or to hang on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-two years old . She was beautiful , chaste , and amazingly informed . She knew things that it had taken her grandmother twenty years of life with a drunken husband to find out and she took them as lightly as her grandmother had taken them seriously . Katie could remember her grandfather . It had been quite a problem to put a good front on his existence , and everybody but his wife had been relieved , under a decent grief , when he finally died . He could n't stand liquor in any quantity . It always made him sing and fight . His family had tried to keep that weakness a secret , but his granddaughter had no such reserves about herself . Everybody in Katie 's crowd knew just what alcohol did to her . As they said , it was never wasted on Katie . She was a good deal like her grandfather in that . She had been brought up in a prohibition decade that had managed to project and extend the excitements and constant debate of the War which had preceded it and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to drinking . She knew about bootleggers . Whenever her father replenished his supply the dinner conversation was subsequently on what the man had brought , what he had charged for it , and how bad the conditions were when you had to deal with people like that , and whether a change would ever be made . But that there had to be liquor was unquestioned . The Caseys were not hard drinkers , but their friends expected rather good wines on their table . They could afford to serve them . And , as it happened , by chance or through a filial delicacy , Katie 's father and mother had never seen her drunk . But it had n't happened many times , and someone always sobered her up fairly well before she went home . Katie had cocktails at home and in other people 's houses and at clubs and once in a while at hotels , and when she went to New York the men she knew took her to very expensive speakeasies , where there never was any sunlight and not much air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She Saw men in all sorts of conditions and sometimes it seemed funny and sometimes she looked away . As for herself , she claimed that she knew what she should take . But once in a whileshe did take more and then there usually was a good story to tell afterwards . She did n't mind . Sometimes she told the stories on herself . If people did n't like what she did that was their hard luck . She did n't have to care , because so many people liked her , because so many men made love to her , because everyone wanted to have her around . She had loved herself in the reflection of her own popularity . It had only been lately , during the last six months , that it had gradually been growing different . It was only since John Murray had been at so many of the parties she also attended . He , too , had liked her at the start . She remembered with unfading distinctness that first night when they had danced together . That was during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worn a pale-blue velvet evening dress for the first time , one that made her eyes so much more blue that the dress was like a soft echo of their color . That night she had had a queer time . It had been partly happy and partly miserable . She had grown dissatisfied with everything . She was tired of having Ford Ames pay her heavy compliments and just as tired of the light insults that were Pat 's form of flattery . She felt as if she were trying to break through the whole thing to something else . Perhaps that first night they had gone a little too far , she and John Murray . He had been frank about himself as he 'd never been since . It happened almost as soon as he met her . He had given her the feeling that theirs was a romantic meeting , that they were on the verge of a great friendship ? or more . He had stayed with her , monopolizing her dances and her attention , at least until supper was served . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , and Katie had made several toasts , very amusing ones they told her the next day . One was a toast to John Murray . But John Murray had never been quite the same after that . He still paid her a good deal of attention . She could always count on his cutting in on her at dances , and he was often a willing skating or swimming or bridge ally , according to the occasion and the season . He was ready enough to talk . But the talk never seemed to get anywhere . Last night was the first time she had felt that again she was breaking down his deliberate reserve . For he had said , " Do you suppose that I could come to see you some time when there is n't a party in the background ? " " Of course , " she told him . " When ? " But someone had cut in just then and he had said , " I 'll call you up in the morning . " He had n't called . Shortly after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caviar Shop , and it was there that she 'd had the extra cocktail and the others and there that she 'd fought with Pat . Then came the ride and the police station . Of course it was all a mess . But , thought Katie , tolerantly , it was the sort of thing that might happen to anyone . If John thinks I should n't drink , why does n't he come out with it ? Why does n't he say so ? Why does n't he ask me not to , instead of standing off and enjoying his critical abilities ? She wondered again what he had said to Ford Ames and began planning certain demonstrations . There was a good deal of excitement in that first week of being on the wagon . It was the end of the summer season , and things were crowding . House-parties gave way reluctantly to country-club dances , and those were only adjourned for weddings . There were teas where everything was served buttea . There were swimming parties and motor-boat excursions . And always and everywhere , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flasks and bottles and glasses . Katie had plenty of chances to display her abstemiousness . " No , thanks , " she said regularly and often , " I 'm not taking any . " Just at first that declaration broke up nearly every group into two schools of thought and gave Katie plenty of limelight . There were always those who tried to tease or cajole her out of her decision . Pat played it up . He said that he had to drink for two and usually did it . One night at the WeUses ' house , when they had reached the highball stage , he brought in a glass of hot milk for Katie . Ford heard the laugh go up and saw what was happening . He went over to Katie and when he could get her attention he said softly and possessively , " I 'm so proud of you . Do n't let them kid you out of it . Stick to it for my sake . You 're won-derful . " Katie looked at John Murray who was standing near . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had an irresistible desire to force his attention . She smiled devastatingly at Ford and carried her milk over to show it to John . " Look at what those idiots brought me . " " Milk , is n't it ? " he said . " Funny for me to be drinking milk , is n't it ? " " Do n't you like it ? " " I might like it on oatmeal , " she answered , " if I liked oatmeal . " " Then why drink it ? " " I 've got to drink something . And do n't you think I ought to give up alcohol ? " He glanced at her in his alert way , and she realized that he was probably the most sober man in the room , not even excepting Ford . People often forgot that John Murray drank so little because he never made apoint of it . " Well , you 're getting a lot of fun out of it , " he said , " are n't you ? It 's certainly one way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stage . " She felt anger heat her quickly and something else that felt like shame made her furious with him . " You think I 'm doing it to attract attention ? " " I did n't say that . I said you were getting attention . " " You 're pretty insulting , " she answered . But she said it rather quietly , not as she might have said it a week ago to Pat at that hour in the evening . It was John who flushed and would have spoken if she had not quickly left him . If temperance was a sensation , it went the transitory way of all sensations . After a week or two nobody cared whether she drank or not . But when it was thoroughly established that she would not , she could feel her role changing . She did not amuse the crowd as she used to with her excitements and tempers and gusts of wild gaiety . She seemed pitched in a lower key . She found herself talking soberly while other people were talking nonsense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously little to do at home . Her parents were still abroad , cabling now and then about the possibility of taking a villa in Italy for the winter . Mrs. Casey had found friends from home in Italy , and her neuritis was better . Mr. Casey was escaping the financing of prohibition . They wanted Katie to come if they stayed over , and Katie tried to believe that she wanted to . But she held decision off . The prospect of a winter abroad did not tempt her any more than a summer abroad had five months ago . Nothing seemed very interesting . Certainly Ford Ames , taking credit to himself for the change in her , was notemptation . He hung about her persistently , praising her , hearing down upon her with a heavy passion that was like a weight . There was the difficult occasion when he asked her to marry him , point-blank . " You know I was always sure that you had character , " he said as he worked up to it , " but it 's wonderful to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing ? " asked Katie . " You have , dear , with this stand you 've taken on drinking . Of course you 've always been attractive to me , Katie . You 've been the girl of my dreams . " She shuddered slightly . " But I hardly dared ask you to marry me when you were drinking so much . " " Why not ? " He should have been warned by her tone , but Ford rarely heard any accents except his own measured ones . " A man has to think of his principles , " he said , " and his ideals . He has to satisfy them . They 're the most important thing in life to him . And you satisfy every one of them now , Katie . " " Do I really ? " " Will you marry me ? " " I should say not , " she answered , " I would n't think of it . " " But Katie ? " " Why , I could n't possibly live with your ideals , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink ! Of all the disagreeable , bumptious things , they 're the worst ! " The denouement of that was most unpleasant . It was the next day that she called up Pat , who had ceased to call her , and asked him if he wanted to go to the cabaret supper that the Debutante League was sponsoring that evening . She had n't intended to go , but all of a sudden she thought she would . There was no use in getting moldy . Pat was delighted and instantly broke all other dates . She could tell from the way he talked that he had a start already . " You are n't going to he all tied up with rules , are you ? " he asked , " rules and white ribbons ? " " Oh , I do n't know , Pat . Try me and see . " She did n't know . They were placed at one of the long tables with people they knew very well and watched the negro dancers and the tangos and danced some themselves while Pat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion was semi-public . The men went upstairs . Hotel suites had been hired to house their supplies for the evening . Pat poured Katie a very dry Martini in a tumbler , under the casual cover of a napkin . " That 's what you 've been needing for weeks , " he said , a little shakily . " Excuse me a minute . I 'm going to fill this thing up . I 'll he hack soon . " Katie held the glass in the circle of her hand . She saw John Murray not far away , sitting with a pretty blonde girl who was rather far along in her cups . She was acting like twenty varieties of fool and being very noisy . Nearly everybody seemed stimulated , careless , gay . It gave Katie a second 's eagerness to be in the game , to have again that quick , unnatural reaction to everything that seemed so like happiness . And yet she did n't want that drink . She knew what it would do to her . It would change everything . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were like . She 'd lose the reality she 'd found in these last few weeks , and even if there had been dull and miserable hours , she had developed a taste for reality . H she got drunk again , she 'd he like that fool of a blonde . And for no reason in the world she remembered her grandfather . Wild Mike , they 'd called him , and he 'd thing , words and actions , seemed to be fumbled between them . " I just came along to tell you that I love you , " he said . " Does that sound perfectly crazy ? " It had sounded like indefinite relief from boredom and disappointment . But Katie played safe . " Why on earth should you ? " she asked . " Why should n't I if I like ? " " Of course it 's legal , " she admitted , " but go on . " " When I saw you last night , Katie ? " Her disappointment caught up his sentence . " So it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to be a temperance girl ? " " It 's whether you drink or not , " said John , " that 's your business . I never could see that it was mine , even when you put it up to me . I never did think you were dependent on liquor . And I told Ford Ames so when he was bleating about it . " So that was the sentence of mystery and not a had one , thought Katie . " Not dependent , " she agreed , " but it was a great help . I 'm a pretty dull person without it . I do n't go over . I feel like grocer 's vermouth . All the time . " " Go ahead and dramatize yourself , " he said , " you ca n't fool mc . Last night I saw drama was n't the real point . You 're too quick for me . I admit it . You 're a dazzler , Katie , but I 've stopped being afraid of you . " " Afraid  --  that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he insisted stubbornly . " I hate being made fun of . I never can make a quick comeback . I 'm serious . I always felt that to you I was only someone to laugh at when you were short on jokes  --  like the night you made that toast . " " I was tight that night . " " I know . But it scared me . You see I 'm serious . By nature . And so , my girl , are you . I saw you last night . I 'll make a woman of you yet , Katie .

Her conversation lapsed until she decided she needed lipstick and reflection on her own content . There was only one slight worry left . " You 're sure you 'd feel like this even if I got tight again ? " " Oh , I think I would , " he said , looking as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When my grandfather got drunk , my grandmother still loved him . But I think I wo n't take a chance . I may not have grandfather 's charm . "
