Few actors ever have a chance to make an entrance that has been built-up for 40 years . In Manhattan one night last week George Bernard Shaw , playwright and actor , made such an entrance . <P> To heighten the effect he tried to deny himself on the day of the performance to the world 's sharpest newshawks-the cameramen of New York Harbor-by shutting himself up in his suite on the world-cruising Empress of Britain . After registering becoming reluctance he emerged at last , only to lose composure when one of the hawks shouted the old cry , " Tell the old fool to turn around ! " Shaw , outraged , seized the cameraman and shook him by the shoulders . Meantime other cameras clickety-clicked , including that of the smart Daily News ( tabloid ) man who had perched above for a hardboiled newshawk's-eye view . That day and the next , before he departed , Shaw was treated by the Press as he has taught the Press to treat him , as the Jimmy Walker of the intelligentsia . <P> Hired for Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad stage of the Metropolitan Opera House . All seats were filled , at a top price of $5 , Shaw graciously waiving his fee . He stepped forth springily from the wings just before 8:30 p. m. , apparently misinformed about the hour of the NBC broadcast , which was 8:45 p. m . He fussed with his beard , rustled his notes and twinkled professionally at Morgan Partner Thomas W. Lament and Banker Jackson Eli Reynolds , present to sponsor and introduce him . At length , when the radiomen , signalled ready and Banker Reynolds made the necessary gestures , the whiskery , long-shanked Irishman arose and began : <P> " Finding myself in an opera house with such a magnificent and responsive audience , I feel an irresistible temptation to sing . ( Applause , applause . ) <P> " But I am afraid , my unfortunate age 76 precludes any performance of that kind . " ( Gales &; gales of laughter . ) <P> Shaw then proceeded to a disquisition , along orthodox Shavian lines , on political economy in the U. S. He talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted his words at 16,345 . Occasionally he was obliged to arouse his audience with such prods as : " I notice that you receive me coldly . " <P> He said that the " 100% American " of yesterday " who had no modern theory of society " had been supplanted by a new sort of citizen best typified by " Mr. Franklin Roosevelt . . . and my friend Randolph Hearst . " The oldtime American was content with the U. S. Constitution as " a charter of anarchism , " but Mr. Hearst and Mr. Roosevelt " are both violently against the Constitution . " <P> He found the capitalist system in the U. S. broken down , the farmers " enslaved , bankrupt and in armed revolt . " The country has been " run into the ditch " by financiers and bankers who are " 95 percent lunatics . " Under the same guidance , the U. S. had cornered the world gold supply and " broken the bank of England . " <P> Next day aboard the S. S. Empress of Britain Mr. Shaw received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Henry George , his early idol . Said he of the Metropolitan Opera show : " I 'm afraid I bungled it . "
