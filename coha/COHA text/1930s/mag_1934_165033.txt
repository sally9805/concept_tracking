I Am Suzanne ( Fox ) , is the third U. S. film made by Lilian Harvey , small , slim English-born actress who made her reputation in a German film , Congress Dances . Like most of Jesse L. Lasky 's productions for Fox , it is aimed at what Hollywood calls " class " audiences . Partly a masterpiece and partly a mess , I Am Suzanne is unique among this season 's musical pictures because it strives for satiric fantasy instead of a high-priced combination of pornography and farce . Its most important actors are not humans but the Piccoli puppets ( TIME , Jan. 22 ) . <P> When Suzanne ( Lilian Harvey ) breaks a leg dancing , her rascally stage manager loses all interest in her welfare . A group of puppeteers take care of her and the scion ( Gene Raymond ) of the chief puppeteer falls in love with her . The rest of I Am Suzanne deals with Suzanne 's uneasy feeling that Tony is really in love not with her but with a puppet portrait he has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fianc 's dreamy affinity with them first confuse , then anger her . When her leg has mended enough for her to dance again , she shoots the tiny effigy of Suzanne through the heart . Finally it appears that Tony prefers the real Suzanne to the one that works on strings . <P> The charm of I Am Suzanne lies in the way it tells a light love story and at the same time gently parodies it . Where the mood of the picture collapses is in such scenes as the one showing the puppet of Suzanne turning ridiculously into the real Suzanne on the stage of a theatre , the one of a heavy-handed adagio dance in which pretty little Lilian Harvey is tossed about like a beanbag by chorus boys . Good sequence : Suzanne 's night mare , when she is dozing in her theatre dressing room , of her trial for murder by a court of furious , scornful puppets . <P> Miss Fane 's Baby is Stolen ( Paramount ) . Taken from a story by Rupert Hughes , this picture harks back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a widowed cinemactress wrapped up in her child ( Baby LeRoy ) . Agonized when she finds him missing from his crib , she refrains for a time from telling the police . She arranges a rendezvous with the kidnappers but they are frightened off by the appearance of some casual motorcyclists . Miss Fane appeals for help by press and radio , even talks through amplifiers while flying over the length &; breadth of California . Her words are heard by a hearty , featherbrained shack-dweller ( Alice Brady ) who grows suspicious of some mean-looking people who have moved in nearby with a baby . She sells them milk , gabbles at them . They are on the verge of killing the baby when the shack woman snatches it away , eludes their shots , escapes in a battered auto mobile to return the child to its mother . <P> A topical film which draws tears with out half trying . <P> Miss Fane 's Baby is Stolen is notable for expert work by Alice Brady and by Jack LaRue who plays the smallest , meanest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
