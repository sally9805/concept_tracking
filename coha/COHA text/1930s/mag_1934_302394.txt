The vicious little Gran Chaco war between Bolivia &; Paraguay last week reached its Gettysburg . Under French-trained General Estigarribia the Paraguayans , born short-end fighters , had harried the Bolivians northwestward across the jungle to the Pilcomayo River , backed them up against their last Chaco stronghold , Fort Ballivian . The Paraguayans planned to take Ballivian and stop . They found the Bolivians entrenched in open hayfields , for the first time in the war . General Estigarribia 's artillery bombarded the trenches for two days . On the second the first wave of Paraguayans stumbled out into the hayfields in a close formation bayonet charge . The Bolivians had their first fun in months . With machine guns they mowed down the lines of little brown men , left not one standing . Another wave came over and another . Here and there an officer and a few men gained the Bolivian trenches , leaped down and died fighting . <P> That night the Paraguayans came over again , four times , but the darkness was not cover enough from the machine guns . Slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solid lines across the plain , across the bodies of their day-old dead . On the fourth day as dusk drew in , the Paraguayan officers led their men in two last desperate charges , as futile as all the others . Thus ended the " Battle of 100 Hours ' ' at Las Conchitas . The dead : 1,000.
