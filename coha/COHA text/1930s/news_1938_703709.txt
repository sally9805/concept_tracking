txt Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain gave another reassurance to France  --  although a carefully qualified one ? when he told the House of Commons today that Tunisia definitely was covered by the Anglo-Italian agreement pledging maintenance of the status quo in the Mediterran  --  an . Last night amid tumultuous applause at the ( " inner of the Foreign Press Association Mr. Chamberlain said : " Our relations with France are so close as to pass far beyond mere legal obligations , since ' they are founded on identity of interest . " This was hailed with . relief across - the English Channel ass offsetting Mr. Chamberlain 's previous statement in Commons that Britain was under " no specific pledge " to help France in case of aggression by Italy . Laborite Puts Question Today Arthur ' Henderson , Laborite , questioning the Prime Minister in Commons , gave him another opportunity to remove uneasiness in France . Mr. Henderson not only asked whether Tunisia was covered by the Anglo-Italian pact but also whether the " government would represent to the Italian Government that aggression against Tunisia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Chamberlain 's answer : " In the view of His Majesty 's Government the undertaking to respect the status quo in the Mediterranean , as embodied in the Anglo-Italian agreement , certainly applies to Tunis . Any action which is contrary to the agreement will , of course , be a matter of grave concern to Hid Majesty 's Government . We can not , however , contemplate the possibility of such an attack as is suggested in the question . " Answering another question , Richard Austen Butler , Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs , said he could not deny that there had been a " certain amount of assistance from Italian sources " in preparation for the new Rebel offensive in Spain . ( Mr. Butler said , however , that he would not like it to be thought " that this amounted to very much more than replacement . " " It certainly does not amount to any increase in the personnel of . Italian troops , " said Mr. Butler . Opposition questioners hammered at him for an admission that this was a violation of Italy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an admission . Meanwhile , diplomatic circles are still buzzing over last night 's boycott of the foreign press dinner by the German Ambassador , Herbert von Dirksen , and German correspondents in London . The affair was so heavily " played " in the press that it completely overshadowed Mr. Chamberlain 's speech , with its promise that his " appeasement " policy would continue . Stormy Reactions in Berlin It was learned tonight that the reactions in Berlin had been stormy , not against Mr. Chamberlain , but against the German Ambassador and Gottfried Aschmann , head of the news department of the German Foreign Office , who had come to London especially for the dinner . Although it had been reported that the order for the boycott came from high quarters in Berlin  --  some say from Chancellor Adolf Hitler , some say Joachim von Ribbentrop ? Foreign Minister  --  an effort was made in Berlin to blame Herr Aschmann . Yet London found it difficult to believe that an official of Herr Aschmann 's experience would have ordered such a.demonstration unless he had been told to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the affair has done the Germans much harm here , especially among British Cabinet Ministers and leading unofficial British personalities who happened to be at the dinner . It was noticed especially that the Italian Ambassador , Count Dino Grandi , and Italian correspondents attended the dinner , although the Italian Embassy had . been told in advance about the German boycott . The German correspondents had another meeting with Herr von Dirksen today to discuss the incident . So far , however , they have not resigned from the Foreign Press Association , nor is any action likely to be taken hither by Germans or by the association . Dr. Stephen Litauer , president of the association , today received what he described as a " courteous " letter from Herr von Dirksen expressing great regret that the association had received no word in advance of his non-attendance of last night 's dinner . The Ambassador said he had intended to let Dr. Litauer know , but that " technical difficulty " had prevented word from being delivered on time . In any case , said the Ambassador , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association . British Comment Sharp Newspa.pero.comment on the affair continued to be pungent . The Manchester Guardian editorially said : " Regrettable though it may be , Mr. Chamberlain had before his own eyes yet another strange example of cooperation . ' Lord Baldwin had been reviled in German papers as a ' guttersnipe ' because he made a humanitarian appeal for help for refugees . " Mr. Chamberlain mildly deplores this vituperation . And Germany solemnly regards herself as insulted , and her Ambassador and her press will not eat dinner with him ! * * * " How much longer can even he keep up the illusion ? Surely everything that has happened since Munich  --  in stripping bare CzechoSlovakia , in merciless persecution of the Jews , in the revived German offensive on the east , in the Italian offensive in the Mediterranean and in Spain , in the growing truculence of Japan toward Western powers ? has brought home the terrible lesson that we shall not compel respect by weakness . Speeches like Mr. Chamberlain 's invite fresh attacks . " The Yorkshire Post comments : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vituperation and attacks . in the Nazi press  --  rigidly controlled , as all know it to be  --  upon leading statesmen of this country , including Earl Baldwin . * * * We can not remain indifferent to ; the effects of other systems as long as they are deliberately calculated to inculcate in their peoples the belief that plunder of the earth is all their own ' who are prepared to take it by force if it is not yielded at their demand . " Rejects Some Questions LONDON , Dec. 14 ( JP ) . ? Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in the House of Commons today dodged several questions pertaining to French-British relations and Italian agitation that began Nov. 30 concerning French territory . He refused to answer a question put by Geoffrey L. /Slander , National Liberal member , whether - Britain and France during recent general staff conversations had made " necessary arrangements for joint defense . " He also declined to reply to Mr. Mander 's question : " Is it not important that France should kpow whether this country is willing to stand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mander 's ques-tions The Labor party decided to bring a motion of censure during a foreign affairs debate next Monday . It will move " That this House has no confidence in the foreign policy of His Majesty 's Government . " Germans Show Surprise BERLIN , Dee . 14 ( " B. ? Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's foreign policy address left German Foreign Office officials surprised today , but confident that it would not upset the appeasement - course of Mr. Chamberlain and Chancellor Adolf Hitler . One of the " ups and downs in politics " and not endangering German-British friendship was the first , if incomplete , reaction among German officialdom . The few morning papers to comment were more critical , but did not mention that the German Ambassador and German press representatives did not attend the London Foreign Press Association dinner at which Mr. Chamberlain spoke . A Foreign Office spokesman said : " We are frankly astonished . We have always regarded Mr. Chamberlain as a man of practical politics who has been working for rapprochement and appeasement . It is n't quite clear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start an argument . " It is true that there have been some unfriendly words here about Earl Baldwin and others , but we do n't pick quarrels  --  we merely hit back if we are struck at . " The spokesman thought Mr. Chamberlain , as the present leader of the British Conservatives , felt he had to say something pleasing to the revered former party leader and Prime 4inister , Lord Baldwin . The Foreign Office spokesman added that the German press had been restrained and well within the bounds of international courtesy considering what Lord Baldwin said to provoke them . ( Lord Baldwin in a speech appealing for contributions to a refugee aid fund spoke of " an explosion of man 's inhumanity to man . " The newspaper Hamburger Fremdenblatt told Mr. Chamberlain to acquaint himself with the idea that " the National Socialist form of government will survive many English governments .
