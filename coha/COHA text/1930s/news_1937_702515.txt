txt It was inevitable from the necessarily disjointed remarks of the President at Friday 's important press conference that next day 's commentators should pick on one or other of the various subjects to be touched upon . The steel men said their industry was in a position to be independent of government orders ; Senator Wheeler defended copper prices ; budget purists wanted to know what a shift in spending had to do with budget balancing : lower price advocates welcomed the outbursts against high prices , but wished the President would be consistent ; and so on . What particularly interested this column was the contribution of the remarks to the known extent of the President 's economic philosophy . In social language he is a utilitarian  --  the happiness of the greatest number . We all are that . It is in the taking of economic action in pursuit of that goal that utilitarians differ . The President seems to be crystallizing his thought toward the control of new fixed investments . At any rate , he would encourage spending on consumption goods at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday reminder of the dangers of overproducing durable goods is the second indication of this approach . If we exclude the Securities Act , which is really a protection of the investor against bad investments , not a national protection against " over " investment , the last tax bill was the first example of this preoccupation . By that bill penalty taxes are levied on corporation savings . The object is to force out accumulations into consumer hands . In spite of this action , however . investment in fixed capital is rapidly recovering , partly out 1pf private savings , partly out of corporation coffers . Other than to announce a switch in government spending from durable goods to " reliefers " who will spend the money on consumption goods , the President on Friday merely raised a note of alarm over the more rapid rate of Idurable goods production than consumption good ? production .

We now demand all kinds of fancy gadgets which have two characteristics : They are optional to material lexistence and they require roundabout methods of ' production involving all kinds of machine industries . Those gadgets are durable goods . They may take the and form either of goods for consumption , such as auto ; mobiles housing , or goods that make consumption chhwinaitiveelryt us turn out the bewildering array of cans on our kitchen shelves , not to mention their contents . In good times the buying of these durable goods by both consumers and producers goes on cheerfully . But , as Dr. Frederick C. Mills explains , " In a very real sense the existence of unused utilities in the form of durable consumption goods and capital equipment represents inventories of goods . " A A A A week ago I mentioned installment buying of consumption goods as inventories . Durable goods purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying comes , and a self-decelerating depression gets under way , current income has to be used in great part for past purchases ; but we keep on buying . with or without the help of government or charity . those consumption goods . That is not the case with durable goods . We make the old car do ; the railroad keeps the old locomotive in service ; and the manufacturer tells the machine tool salesman to come again next year . In this way a whole peck of trouble and unemployment is invited for the community which it never knew in the simple horse and buggy days . In 1922-29 the country 's physical output Increased faster than during twice that period prior to the World War . And it grew over twice as fast as the production of consumption goods .

The output of durable goods , for the reason already given , practically faded away . Even for those durable goods that are used by consumers , e. g. , automobile output fell precipitously . New cars decreased from 5,621,715 in 1929 , to 1,431,494 in 1932 , though the number of registrations declined only from 26545,281 to 24.136,879 . Thus a decline of nearly 75 per cent in annual production corresponded to only a little over 9 per cent in total number in use . If figures were available showing the number of cars which merely stood unlicensed in the owners ' garages or back yards , the total number , as Prof. J. M. Clark in his " Strategic Factors in Business Cycles " shows , might show no decrease at all .
