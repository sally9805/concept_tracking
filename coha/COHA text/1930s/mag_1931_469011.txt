THE room was thick with the smoke of three hundred and eighty-six cigars and cigarettes , noisy with the hum of conversation , the scraping of chairs on the floor , and the banging of china , when the toastmaster arose . He was a fattish gentleman with a red face made somewhat redder from the exertion of breaking the eighteenth amendment . The noise and conversation abated only slightly as he stood up ; with difficulty could his words be heard . Thunders of applause swept the room . Then a strong head appeared above them , and there was instant silence . The diners stretched in their seats to see him , miraculously the noise died away , the clatter of plates stopped , two waiters in the rear with trays of dishes in their hands turned around to look at Maguire . He stood there before them , a stocky figure in a plain business suit , a square face with an Irish jaw , a face tanned by exposure to a thousand suns , the face of an outdoor man who loved the outdoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bristling hair , as provocative , that hair , as his chin , which was the chin of a fighter . For some seconds he stood there , surveying and surveyed , master of himself , master of the situation , Maguire , Builder of Men . He looked slowly around , from one side to the other . Then he extended his arms in a dramatic gesture . " Brothers in sport . " .. . His voice was the voice of power , the voice of a strong man , not the voice of a college professor but the voice of a man used to command and used also to being instantly obeyed . He spoke in a low , heavy tone , but every word was audible in the distant corners of the banquet hall . " Brothers in sport , I come here this evening to speak to you about intercollegiate football . This great American game needs no defense , least of all to you men here to-night . And if it did , I should be the first to defend it . Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I love it . " No mistaking the mates sincerity . " Yes , I love football . And so should all of us . Gentleman , football has made our nation college-conscious . It is the most effective antidote we possess to-day in the United States to the softening up of our American youth which is taking place on every hand . It is the one great antidote to the sorority teas and to the biggest problem faced by the American college , the week-end parties in the nearby city . " Now his voice became slightly raised . " Gentlemen , I tell you that Chatto Theory was won in the Rose Bowl at Pasadena , the Argonne was won upon the playing fields of Michigan and Noter Dame . " This was the stuff his listeners had come for . Doc , they felt , was now getting into his stride . They leaned forward eagerly , hoping that he was off on an attack against the football reformers . When he struck he hit with all his Irish courage and belligerency . " For , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? democracy boiled down to the last degree . It is what we stand for in this great land of ours . When the whistle blows " ? Doc paused momentarily , and under the spell of his magic three hundred and eighty-six men were transported to the green turf of the Rose Bowl at Pasadena ? " when the whistle blows out there " ? bis right arm was outfiung and a single finger pointed dramatically toward a bunch of waiters gathered about the screen which hid the entrance to the serving pantry and the kitchens ? " when the whistle blows out there , and one of my boys takes the field . . . gentlemen , he 's on his own . " Now he leaned forward intently over the table ; one felt the strength and force of his rich personality , the ringing truth of his words . " Out there he has only himself to depend on . Out there family do n't help . Money do n't help . Nothing helps that boy , only his own courage and character . That 's intercollegiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . " He paused while the burst of applause that he expected swept over the tables , over the speaker and the redfaced toastmaster and the three hundred and eighty-six listeners and the knot of waiters by the entrance to the serving pantries . Maguire was off , and soon the sparks would fly . Fly they did . Now his face became animated . His arms flung wide , he turned with intense face from one side of theroom to the other ; not a soul in that entire ball but was drawn by the force of his personality . He had interested them , then attracted them , then subjugated them , and he knew it ; they were his to work on , to do with as he desired . His thick body was tilted forward ; like an animal in the jungle , he leaped upon his prey . " Some people are always talking about over-emphasis on athletics . " What scorn , what vitriol he managed to pour into those words . " Overemphasis ! " You pitied the weakkneed professors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meddlers who had dared to suggest that all was not right with football . One after the other Maguire pounced upon these detractors of healthy outdoor sport , and slew them with witty invective , to the delight of the big room . " What do those fellows want , anyhow ? I suppose they 'd like us to play tag football and stop for tea between every quarter . Thirty days in jail for any boy caught throwing a forward pass ! " Ali , this was the real , the great Maguire . The room vibrated in sympathy with him as his voice rose . Now he was fairly shouting . " Over-emphasis . The wail of the disappointed . The whine of the defeated . " The career of II William J. ( Doc ) Maguire is merely another example of the heights to which a poor unknown American boy unaided except by his own intelligence and initiative can rise . Twenty-eight years ago Bill Maguire , as be was then known to the boys in Public School 160 on the East Side of New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played on the pavements of Manhattan . To-day he is not only Doe Maguire , the Doc Maguire , most famous of football coaches , originator of the Maguire System which is copied and imitated wherever football is played ; he is also one of the few real celebrities of the United States . Recently a professor in a Western university asked the teachers in six Junior High schools in his State to get their boys and girls to name the twenty-five great Americans of history . Among the leaders in the final count were Lincoln , 2.2,345 ; Washington , 22,294 ; Edison , 20,627 ; Coolidge , 19,598 ; Maguire , 18,326 ; Ford , 17,563 ; and Babe Ruth , 16,458 . That 's how Maguire stands with the youth of this country ! Unlike most football coaches , Maguire never went to college . He left school to find work and help his widowed mother ; Saturdays and Sundays he used to play professional football with a team that was tough and rough over in Newark . Here be made a connection that led to his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also ran a so-called " gymnasium " on First Avenue for New York business men . There Maguire worked several years arid acquired his nickname Doe . As a conditioner of the masculine sex he had no equal ; moreover his pleasing wit made him many friends and acquaintances who grew fond of the laughing young Irishman . One afternoon the head coach of a small Southern college dropped in to work off the effects of a Manhattan New Year 's party . Maguire helped him . They became friends , and the next fall the boy was officially appointed trainer at Milligan University in southern Georgia . The Doe 's rivals will tell you that he has had luck . Yes , of course . But he also had brains and energy enough to seize a situation and capitalize it to the limit . Right in the middle of the second season at Milligan , the head coach died of a sudden attack of heart trouble . Doc took bold of the squad the next afternoon without being asked , and brought them along at the peak to their Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the champions of the South for the sake of their coach who had died is still quoted at Milligan . Their victory that afternoon over the University of Georgia surprised everyone except the Doc . He ended the sea son with two more victories ; naturally he stayed on . At twenty-six he was almost the youngest head coach in the country . Success counts . From Milligan he went at double the salary to Clemson , and then after three years he got a big raise to go with the Chameleons ? Fulton , in case you do n't know ? and so to South Dakota State , where he made his remarkable record of four years without the loss of a single game . Then to Marquette and thence to the position he now occupies ? as originator of the Maguire System , the man who brought forth intercollegiate champions three years in succession , who coached Maguire 's Tearing Tornadoes , as the sports writers called them . He produced such superstars as " All America Eddie " O'Brien in 1926 , Dutch Yablowich in 1928 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hardcrusher " Yiswonski , in 1930 . It was during last season , you remember , that be turned out an unscored-on eleven in thirteen games including two intersectional contests , which prompted Grantland Rice to christen his team " Maguire 's Marvels . " The name stuck . Among lovers of the game this masterful eleven will always be spoken of reverently as " Maguire 's Marvels " whenever football is discussed . But it was not always success and triumph for Doc . In his early days at Milligan and Fulton he was coach , trainer , manager , rubber , general fixer , and everything else . Money was scarce down there , and his equipment in those days consisted of uniforms that were hand-me-downs , bought second-hand from castoffs at the State University . His footballs ? all three ? were patched and mended by the local shoemaker more than once in a season ; winning a game was a lucky break because it gave them another football and a new one . His medicinal resources were a bucket of water , a large bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than once Doc had to rip some of that precious tape from a healing shoulder or ankle and slap it onto another man with a fresh injury . He used to say that he did everything in those days , including blowing up the footballs . Funny , all that seems now . Yes , but it was n't so funny to the Doc at the time . For the odds were against him , the cards were stacked , he had to win ? or lose his job . He possessed no reputation , no countrywide fame as he does at present ; in those days the stern , strong face of Maguire , Builder of Men , thrown upon a movie screen , did not bring instant applause as it does in 1931 . Then he was unknown , and victory was necessary , not merely desirable . After all , as Doc says to his teams , and he is only preaching what he himself practices , " It 's results that count in life . " Just occasionally he does relax a bit and become sentimental in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment that he made this remark about his profession : " One defeat a season is good for the coach 's soul . Two defeats are bad for his contract . " Maguire 's friends among the coaching fraternity , who do not always look with enthusiasm upon his progress either in the fields of sport or the fields of commerce , say to one another that he is a " hound for publicity . " How untrue this is , only those close to the great man can testify . It is of course a fact that publicity has been showered upon him , that he is better known thananyone else in university life . But to say that Doe sought publicity is unfair and false . When interviewed by newspapermen ( whom he always tried to help in every possible manner ) he would say , " Leave me outa your story , Jim , leave me out . Give the credit to the team . Forget all that stuff about me ? it 's the boys that count . " But , with the sympathy so characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reporter on assignment , always willing to discuss the team 's chances or pose for a picture whenever desired . That 's Doc all over . The sports writers realize this and respond by giving the Doc the best of the breaks . Two things make him good copy , the fact that he and his teams are colorful , and his Irish sense of humor . He refuses to take things too seriously . In victory or defeat he is forever ready with a flip remark . More often perhaps in victory than defeat , but then . . . Once when he had openly predicted that his team would be defeated by two touchdowns , they actually won 14-0 . Taxed afterward with being a bad prophet , he replied , " The Maguire System is based on deception ? " Doe is a great believer in getting all the fun out of life you can , and at the start of the season he always impresses on his squad that " fun goes hand in hand with good sportsmanship . " This is why Maguire 's teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughest of matches . In fact the tougher the match the more intense their kidding . Strangely enough , some of their opponents take it wrong and seem to get really upset by it , but this only shows that some people have no sense of humor . Sometimes it helps pave the way to victory , this harmless backchat . In an important moment of a big game a quick-witted end on a Maguire team asked his opponent , who happened to be from the same town , " Say , how 's that good-looking sister of yours ? " The other end relaxed for a minute to consider a reply , and like a flash Maguire 's man had blocked him off successfully . The play went for a thirty-two yard gain and a touchdown on the next shot . Smartness of this kind often brings Doe 's team to victory . That particular incident caused the Builder of Men considerable annoyance , however . Dear old Professor Jenkinson of the Greek department happened to learn of the maneuver , and asked timidly at a faculty meeting whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision of the university were to be prepared to join the fellowship of educated men ? No one on the faculty actually dared protest openly , but news of the remark reached Maguire 's ears . " What 's the old geezer talking about , anyhow ? " he retorted . The next time he encountered the learned scholar walking across the campus with his green cloth bag , Doc stopped him . " Hey there , Perfesser . " And hauling forth from his pocket the 1931 Football Guide , he pulled out his rule book and proved to the old man that there was nothing in it against what he had done . And , therefore , it was perfectly okay , was n't it ? It was Doc who invented the phrase , " Downtown Quarterbacks , " for the second guessers who sat in the stands and explained what was wrong with the way the team was being run . To an All American center of his who was being outplayed by an aggressive opponent , he declared between the halves , " Trouble is , Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take your clippings out and show him this half ! " And once when he was disciplining one of his star men for an infraction of training rules , he read the starting line-up in the dressing room just before the kickoff , and then remarked , " Friedman , I 'll needyou after all . " The boy jumped up , convinced that the Doc could n't get along without his help in a big game . " Want you to go up in the press box and help that man there identify the players . " Maguire is a conservative , but a thoughtful and resourceful conservative ; he can take a radical step and stand the ensuing criticism without flinching . Doc was the first head coach to abolish the position of captain on the eleven . Fraternity politics forced this for the good of the squad ; now a new leader is appointed for each game . By the Doc . But there is no permanent captain . Naturally some silly talk arose about the players being simply chessmen under his directions ; but he paid no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are no more chessmen than are the players of any other college , The difference is simply that Dile is honest enough to admit openly that the captain is a figurehead , something most head coaches lack the moral courage to do . Doc does n't exactly dominate his teams , but no one has ever yet heard of any of his boys disobeying his pre-game instructions . He explains to his quarterback beforehand how the strategy of the contest shall be conducted , and then leaves the actual tactics to the boy , except when things go wrong or the boy makes a mistake or misses the gaining play , in which case Doc shoots a substitute in without delay . He has been known also to jest with the boys on occasion . Once they were in a terrific battle with Northwestern , backed up to their own goal , opponent 's ball on the four-yard line , third down and three to go , and the score nothing to nothing . A substitute came charging in . After the next play time was called . The eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 'd he say ? " they asked . " He says hold ' em , " was the reply . When a crisis does arise requiring his intervention , Doe 's methods of communicating with the quarterback are often subtle and devious . In an important intersectional contest his team 's running attack stalled close to the opponent 's goal . The winning play , a sure-fire gainer , had apparently been overlooked by the man on the field . So Doc sent a substitute running along the sidelines , supposedly warming up . On his back was 68 , the number of the play . The quarterback caught on immediately , so did a lot of other people , including the officials ; but how could you stop it You could n't . The play scored . Smart , heads-up football ! Of course Doc does n't do this often ; luckily it is n't often necessary . And , besides , he believes in letting the boys run their own game as much as possible . The idea of giving football back to the players entirely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give the game back to the players ! That do n't mean nothing , that 's just a slogan , " he insists . " Lemme tell you one thing , the day you give football back to the players , you 'll give racing back to the horses ! " One of Doe 's really original contributions to the game was the changing of costumes . He 'd start his first eleven in red uniforms with blue stripes and throw in his second team in the next half with blue uniforms and red stripes , while the following Saturday the uniforms would be reversed so that his opponents never knew exactly which team they were facing . Or he 'd confuse them still further by putting all his men in plain blue uniforms and starting his second-string backfield behind his first-string line . Sometimes he would put in four different elevens on the field before a game , each one in a different-colored get-up . Not only did it mystify the opposition ; more important still it always got the crowd , And Docknew well the value of having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old trick of Doe 's ; through it came the name " Chameleons , " a name that stuck to his team wherever they went . Even in defeat his squad was so colorful that the " Chameleons " invariably stole the show . " Maguire football , " it came to be known whenever Doe outguessed some nationally known team . There was the Curley incident . Curley was a firststring end who was removed from the field by the officials in the Pittsburgh game , the final contest of the season . It was the only time a Maguire-coached player had ever been sent off the field in disgrace , and naturally considerable comment ensued . The inside story was that Doe 's team , weakened by a costly victory the previous week over California , was threatened with the loss of its first game in years , to Pittsburgh , a strong team built around an All American back named Davison . Davison was the star of the year , the most dangerous back in football . Maguire saw this , knew Pittsburgh would be helpless without him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight with Davison early in the contest . Soon the two men were rolling on the ground , pummeling each other . The officials promptly separated them and sent each to the sidelines for the remainder of the game . Maguire had two substitute ends as good as Curley ; but Pittsburgh without Davison was a second-rate eleven . This story of how Maguire outsmarted the Panthers got out because an untrustworthy newspaperman , who had received the story confidentially , decided to print it . Again the Builder of Men found himself in difficulty with the faculty , and this time they were so aroused that Doc was called before them to explain his actions . He came into that bunch of misguided idealists with his rule book in hand . In a few well-chosen and impressive words he showed those soft-hearted saps conclusively that Maguire played the game , that what he had done was against no football rule and , therefore , perfectly legal . An unanswerable argument . But the trouble caused him after that to keep his quick thinking to himself . Once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by having an end limp badly after a certain play . Instantly Maguire came rushing on to the field with outstretched hand and , kneeling down , felt the boy 's leg carefully . With a shake of his head betokening despair , he called for tape and bound it up . But on the next play the end limped worse than ever , so badly that he could hardly keep up with the game , and the crowd began to call on Maguire to take him out . On one line-up the end was left dismally hopping about way over at one side of the field . Suddenly the back with the ball turned and shot him a perfect forward pass . Like a winged Mercury the damaged player galloped to the goal line , his injury completely forgotten . Thus does the Builder of Men prove that something besides brute strength counts in football . As he replied to a small boy ( Doe answers all his fan mail personally ) who had written him after the California game : " Brains will always win over brawn and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Iv Doe 's detractors like to call him hard-boiled . So he is , too , at times . But not always . Connected with the college are various deans , assistant deans , faculty advisers , professors , and instructors , yet it is to the blue-eyed Irishman and not to any of these officials that the undergraduates in trouble always turn . Not only the men heknows , the members of his squad , but any boy can call on Doe for help or advice and be sure of a sympathetic listener and be sure also of coming away from that office with courage in his heart to face life once more . There are those who avow that this love of young men is a pose . The same thing has been suggested about his love of football ; they say that he is merely in it for what he can get out of it , for money . Doc himself never stoops to contradict these impressions ; his intimates know better . There is money in coaching for Doc just as there would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen ; but he would go on coaching football and enjoy it to the full if he made only a thousand dollars a year . Happily he will never be put to the test . The fact is that the financial rewards of coaching were his almost before he was aware of it ; one moment he was an unknown Yankee teaching football to a bunch of cottonseeds in a tiny college in Georgia , the next moment he was Maguire , the great Doc , the man who put over Maguire 's Marvels . The rewards of success , that 's all . He is simply reaping the harvest . All his life he has insisted that victory is an important part of every game and that if you do not care about winning you might as well not play . He wanted winning teams and he wanted to be associated with winners only ; to Doc a loser was a quitter , and he impressed this upon his men ? so well that they usually won . America loves a winner . Doc was a winner , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , were merely the guerdons of success . After ail , one can hardly blame him for this . For instance , his public speaking developed by imperceptible degrees . Some of his old players who had heard his fight talks remembered him as a powerful emotional talker with something real to say . One of them requested his help at a Y. M. C. A. banquet , and Doc , always anxious to assist his boys , responded and was the hit of the evening . Then it was someone else who wanted him for a Lions ' luncheon . Soon demands upon his time were such that to protect himself he was forced to make a fixed rule never to speak anywhere for less than fifty dollars and expenses . Immediately the requests doubled . Then it was a hundred and expenses . But once you had heard Maguire , Builder of Men , you were not likely to forget him ; before long the invitations had doubled again . Now he is regularly attached to a speaking bureau in New York , gets five hundred for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is only part of his income . Curiously enough the smallest fraction comes from coaching . Believe it or not , Doc gets only six thousand a year from the college , exactly the sum a full professor receives . This is frequently mentioned by the college authorities when someone outside twits them about the Doc and his somewhat commercial activities . Alas , says the President , we are a poor college , we can not pay more . What he neglects to mention is the fact that the Doc also gets a share of the annual football profits when these amount to more than a hundred thousand dollars . Last season they were slightly above half a million . No one except the Doc , the Athletic Manager , and the President knows of this agreement , and none of the three is likely to discuss it . Doc is also versatile , and before long he discovered that what could be spoken could also be transposed to paper . " If we talked less in the press and more among ourselves we would do better , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , but this was before he himself became an author , before hisfootball dope began to be syndicated extensively every year by the four hundred and sixty newspapers of the Morgan-Booth Syndicate throughout the country . Naturally , as a member of the All America Board of Coaches , a mythical body which was a figment of the constructive imagination of the head of the syndicate , his name carried weight and his opinion on the game was worth money . Do n't imagine that Doc does not write all his own stuff . He does , every word . And a dreadful time he had of it with his novel , Held at the Goal Line , a work upon which he spent over two years . He was disappointed in the results from this effort , at which some of the bolshevistic sports writers were tempted to poke fun , and the sale was something less than the effort warranted . However , the movie rights ran well up into four figures , so Doe 's faith in the power of the written word was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with the movies his recent textbook , Maguire On Football , a volume which is read , discussed , quoted , and argued over wherever the game is played . For brother coaches who stoop to sell their names to the newspapers , who permit ghost writers to compose their signed articles , he has nothing but open contempt . " Dishonest commercialists , betraying the good name of football , " was his comment upon this in one of his most biting speeches , in which be defended the game yet at the same time admitting the abuses with which it was threatened . His scorn was equally great for his rival Rockne who sold his name endorsing products . To coaches who do this sort of thing to make money , Doc is bitter and hard . Of course , he makes money out of the game but , as he explains , he makes money honestly , writes his own stuff , and " do n't allow nothin ' phoney . " One summer he gave up his entire vacation to work carefully on a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . These films portrayed him in coaching togs on the gridiron with his boys , and in addition to explaining , elucidating , and popularizing the game itself , they gave him a chance to do some real constructive work by shooting home in his talk some of his rugged philosophy warning against the evils of " softening up " and setting forth good clean amateur sport , and football especially , as the natural remedy . V If he desired to do so , Doc has the income to live in one of those magnificent new brick mansions with surrounding gardens in Mansfield Avenue on the Heights , but he is an unpretentious soul and still prefers the two-story wooden frame house he has occupied ever since he came to Collegeville . It is a small , white-painted affair , no better than the home of the average professor , and many strangers to town can hardly believe that the great Maguire actually lives so modestly . But he does . And what is more , he likes it . Essentially a family man , he would rather stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially during the football season , keeps him on the move . At least two nights a week he is speaking . Meetings of the Coaches ' Association drag him away from home ; so do out-of-town games , frequently to his annoyance . For above everything he is a family man , and asks nothing better than to have his picture taken washing dishes with his wife after dinner or sitting on the porch of his little home surrounded by the " Old Lady " and the " kiddies . " Doc 's daily routine is characteristic of the man . It is a model of the speed which he demands when his eleven takes the field . Up at seven o'clock , from nine until noon he is at the Administration Building dictating letters , articles , speeches , or radio talks , and from time to time answering the telephone or seeing some boy who has come to him in trouble . Lunch he eats with the squad ; then follows an hour and a half of classroom drill in football tactics and science . He goes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , answers four or five long-distance telephone calls , submits to a couple of interviews by newspapermen , and rushes off to dress for practice at three . Doc is never late , and no player with respect for his job is late , either . Five o'clock , a shower , and he is hack at the office , or else on a train en route to town to attend a banquet and deliver the address of the evening . Doc never travels by car because it wastes time and energy . If he remains in Collegeville he eats again with the boys , and in the evening there is a coaches ' meeting in the office . For Doc has a staff of fifteen or twenty men under him : coaches , assistant coaches , freshmen coaches , trainers , dietitians , scouts , and others to superintend . He gets away about midnight , refuses a lift in the end coach 's ear , walks slowly home , lets himself into the house noiselessly , and goes to the icebox , where Mrs. Maguire has left a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These digested , his seventeen-hour day is finished , and so to bed . Doe 's office looks like the office of any big corporation executive : dictaphones , a couple of telephones on his desk , two secretaries close at hand , and filing cases lining the sides of the room . Indeed , Doc is just that ? the executive of a corporation doing a business of more than five hundred thousand dollars annually . As you see him there seated at his desk , keenly competent , alert , master of every situation , his thick bushy hair and his Irish jaw are the only things to remind you of the young man who carried Milligan to victory over the champions of the South thirty-two years ago . For despite everything he can do , Doc is becoming a typical corporation executive , he is putting on weight , his chins seem these days to double with his income . Before him on the desk are two piles of opened letters ? the morning mail . One pile is for him to read and answer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to one of his two assistants in the outer office to handle . He picks up the first letter and squints at it through half-closed eyelids . At the bottom of the sheet is a familiar signature . Doc shakes his head dolefully . It is a request for money from one of his old stars , the kind of appeal he has received before and will receive again . Maguire , Builder of Men . What has become of those men he built ? Some of them hold important positions in the industrial world of the United States ; they are his pride , a credit to him , he never misses a chance to refer to them in his speeches by name . But there are also many he does not mention in his " **31;1043;TOOLONG -made-America-wh at-it-is-today " talks . For instance , " Big Boy " Jim Delaney of the 1924 champions " Big Boy " is now running a lunch wagon in Akron , Ohio . And Dave Tracy , All American end in 1929 . Dave is an entertainer in a night club in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iron Man " Jim McNulty , a star guard on one of his early elevens . " Iron Man " has lost his place as night watchman in a factory in Kansas City and needs money . Doe 's heart is ever open to requests of this sort , and although no one but his secretary knows about it , he gives away almost five thousand dollars in the course of a year to his old boys who are down in their luck . He looks out of the window where in the sunlight of autumn the leaves aregolden on every tree . " Send him a check for twenty-five dollars . Today , Miss Schmaltz . " His gaze comes back once more to the pile of mail before him . With a sigh he picks up the next letter . " Take this ... to Mr. James K. Densmore , American Broadcasting Company , 505 Fifth Avenue , New York . Dear Sir : I will be glad to do the national hook-up you suggest on the 1931 football season upon the 28th of this month . Price as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Mason , A. G. Findlay &; Sons , Chicago , Illinois . Dear Tom : Your good letter to hand .

Let me hear from you ... all best wishes . ... Now then ... that Daily Wisecrack for the Morton people . " He leans back in his chair and glances again through the open window . The Daily Wisecrack is a small item run every day on the sport pages of six hundred newspapers throughout the country during football season . It carries Doe 's signature . " H 'm ... h 'm ... when the coach . . . no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team you 're a great coach ; but when you lose four games in one season you 're only a character-builder . There , guess that will hold old Stoddard a while . " ( Stoddard is head coach at Yale , a consistent loser who has commented upon Maguire 's business success in rather uncomplimentary terms of late . ) The telephone tinkles softly . " Who ? Who ? Yes , but which Smith , what Smith ? Of the New York Times ? Why didn ' you say so ? Yes , ' course I 'll talk . . .
