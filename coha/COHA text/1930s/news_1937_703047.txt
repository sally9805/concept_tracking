txt The Christmas Good Fellow organization sponsored by THE TRIBUNE broke the record of 29 years of service yesterday when it distributed toys , food , and clothing to more than 8,000 Chicago children who might otherwise have been overlooked by Santa . Year , after year , reflecting the spirit of the dear Lord ' who has entered into their hearts , the Good Fellows increase in number and strength . They have doubled in numbers during the last five years . Yesterday and last evening 1,552 of them carried the light of the star into the city 's darkest streets , and left joy in their wake .

This was the first time that most of these families had ever had a radio in their homes and the air was soon filled with carols and dance music in tune with the gladness that the gifts had brought . All children know what secrets are at this time of the year . And the adventures that those agents of Santa Claus met with yesterday must remain a tender and beautiful secret . No one knows what events are set in motion here , what new causative chains of action are forged , new hope established , what forces are unlocked in these personal contacts . No event is lost in the arcane of nature or of love . The trembling of a flower reaches a star . Start at 8 A. M.

The Chicago Newspaper Carriers ' association took care of 76 families . The J. Wesley Jones Negro Good Fellows carried 25 baskets to the homes they had selected . Some inkling of what the major army of Good Fellows encountered is given in the reports of TRIBUNE reporters who were sent to deliver the baskets purchased with the gift fund . These follow : " SANTA HAS COME ! " BY DORIS LOCKERMAN . There was an air of well-being in the home on North Mozart street even before the Good Fellows arrived . Part of it , of course , came from a pound of hamburger chilling on a back window sill , ready for a Christmas meat loaf for six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cardboard crosses and yellow paper chains . And the tattered starched curtains did their part . But the rest of the cheer , and there was enough to fill the bare little rooms , came from a tired , pale woman who is 42 years old and still believes in Santa Claus . So much so that she stood at her window Yesterday waiting for him , with her tiny baby balanced on her hip , and with second-from-the-youngest Danny rubbing his chapped cheek against her skirt . It was a stunge thing . Just at that very moment the Good Fellows came and saw them standing there , these three in their window . And the mother , probably because she was so tired , mistook the Good Fellows for Santa Claus . " Here they are , Danny , " she cried . " Santa has come ! " Sho looked wonderingly at the food and toys , then ' sank down beside the heaped basket . She held her head down a moment , and no one but Danny knew she was crying . And Danny only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look up into her eyes to be sure what she had said was really true . A BASKET FOR SEVEN ? 1 BY VIRGINIA GARDNER . The Good Fellow car bounded over ruts in a Vine street block more like an alley than a street , went past refuse heaps and pulled up before a ' house whose paintless timbers miraculously hung together . From behind clean white curtains on the second floor little black faces peered out , broke into brilliant toothy smiles . Feet clattered down the narrow wooden stairway and a door was thrown open . Gentle and quiet , with shining eyes and teeth , the seven children clustered around a tiny iron stove while Carolyn , 11 years old , knelt before it and distributed gifts from the overflowing basket . Then she put the turkey and the foodstuffs away . The mother was away , their father away for good . Marion , a boy , 7 years old , had a doll marked to him by mistake . It did not dismay him . He gave a cry of delight . " Roberta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and , reaching out from a jacket sleeve that was little more than a wristlet , he grasped the doll and tenderly placed it in the arms of his little sister . He got her present , and it never occurred to him that stringing beads for jewelry is less fun for a boy than a girl . " Christmas , " said the colored man in the dimly lit hallway , grinning as the Good Fellows passed with a basket heaped with food and toys , topped by a radio . " Christmas ! " echoed a woman three flights up . " That 's wonderful . I thought we was n't going to get anything . Vera Mae cried all day yesterday because she hated to see Christmas come . " When the radio was unpacked and suddenly filled the tiny apartment with music , five childish voices stopped to listen , and Ford , who is 2 years old , and Minnie , 4 , began to dance their own version of the Big Apple . The mother sat down on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " The kids used to go down the hall at night and listen to radio bedtime stories at other doors , but we never had one . " The father , who has a heart ailment and has n't worked for months , came in from the relief station in time to supervise stowing the turkey away in the ice box , newly filled with ice , and as the Good Fellows left sounds of the radio followed them down the stairs . It was playing " Silent Night , Holy Night . " GEE , THANKS A MILLION BY II . S. KOGAN . Four sad-eyed children peered from behind the tattered curtains as the two Good Fellow messengers descended the rickety stairs to a basement flat in South Canal street . Five minutes later , their eyes filled with joyous wonder , the children fondled the toys they had drawn from the big basket of Christmas cheer . The father , unemployed , smiled timidly and held out his hand : " Gee , fellows , thanks a million .

Carl , the father , an unemployed carpenter , beamed his gratitude . Harriet , the mother , silently clasped the hands of the Good Fellow messengers . Ruthie , Edna , and Bobbie danced about to music from the new radio . And Carl Jr. , 12 , the eldest child , who sells newspapers after school to aid the family , grinned broadly : " Maybe you fellows ai n't got white beards and red coats but , oh boy , you 're a couple Santa Clauses to us ! " NO STANDING IN LINE BY GREER WELLIAMS . Relief groceries do not go far when there are five mouths to feed and Christmas calls for plentitude . Therefore , a young Italian widow took her son , Gildo , 10 years old , and went to stand in the food basket line at the Volunteers of America station at Washington boulevard and Francisco avenue . She left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6 , and Victoria , 4 , in their bare little third floor rear flat on West Adams street . That was the way the Good Fellow found them , waiting for mother and Gildo to bring home a basket . The quantity of food , the candy , the presents for every one , and the radio the Goodfellow brought were far more than their mother , whose husband died four years ago , had hoped for . One of the neighbor 's children went to get mother and son from the line . The Volunteers at the station marked her application card " taken care of . " With that , the widow and her children happily agreed . NO WAITING IN VAIN BY BETTY BROWNING . On West Armitage avenue four eurly-haired children came swarming down to greet the Good Fellows even before there was time to unload the big basket of food and toys .

Edward , 9 years old , the eldest , came running In , and Dickie and Joe came forward with his present , crying together , " This is for you . " While they were all busy setting up the little croquet set that was In Edward 's box , the mother whispered , " I 'm so glad you 've come . My husband has n't any work  --  do n't know what we could have done ? " Diana , 2 years old , was a bit frightened at the idea of having her picture taken carrying a box left by Good Fellow .
