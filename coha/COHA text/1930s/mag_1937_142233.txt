Last week in St. Louis , death from heart failure came to John T. Rogers of the Post-Dispatch and ended the career of the last authentic Star Reporter of national renown . Fifty-five when he died , Reporter Rogers had worked on the Post-Dispatch for 20 years , on other papers for 13 before that . If his exploits are made the basis for a melodramatic newspaper film , the script will require the addition of no synthetic excitement , for Reporter Rogers ' professional life was as adventurous as they come . <P> To Reporter Rogers , sprawling St. Louis and its adjacent territory was as familiar as a backyard to a housewife . In high &; low circles , friendly Rogers had hundreds of confidential contacts , known in newspaper shops as " pipelines . " So persuasive was he that he sometimes was able to mesmerize criminals into confessions which made jailing or hanging evidence for the prosecutor as well as scoops for the Post-Dispatch . <P> In 1922 , Rogers went to investigate the disappearance of two planters near Mer Rouge , La . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men had been liquidated by the Ku Klux Klan . He bearded the local Exalted Cyclops , got from him the admission that this theory was right . Reporter Rogers traced the missing planters to Bayou La Fourche . Dynamiting brought the men 's bodies swirling to the surface while Rogers and National Guardsmen stood by . <P> Most remarkable criminal confession obtained by Reporter Rogers was in the middle 1920s , when Charles Birger and his gunmen were terrorizing " Bloody Williamson " County in southern Illinois . Impressing the Birger mob by his revolver marksmanship on empty beer bottles , Reporter Rogers became so chummy with a thug named Arthur Newman that in 1927 Newman confessed to the Post-Dispatch how he and Birger had murdered State Policeman Lory Price and his wife . Officials had never been able to find Mrs. Price 's body ; Rogers ' revelations located it in an abandoned mine shaft . Newman was jailed for life . Charlie Birger went to the gallows . <P> Same year ( 1927 ) Reporter Rogers received the Pulitzer Prize for the ousting of Federal Judge George W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescued Dr. Isaac D. Kelley from mysterious St. Louis kidnappers . All St. Louis wondered about the Kelley case . Reporter Rogers solved it early in 1934 when a " pipeline " produced news that implicated Mrs. Nellie Tipton Muench and others ( TIME , May 11 , 1931 , et seq . ) . <P> Lanky , agreeable , fond of talking about himself , Reporter Rogers was well paid , drew many a big bonus for big stories . Once an unknown benefactor deposited $1,000 in the Rogers checking account . At Christmas his mailbox so overflowed with cards and gifts that once he remarked : " The whores and hoodlums always remember me ! "
