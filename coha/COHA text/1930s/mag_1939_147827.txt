Far and away the toughest airplane pilots on the North American continent are the rakehell Canuck airmen who since the ' 20s have lugged machinery and prospectors , food and engineers into the vast country north of Canada 's twin transcontinental railroads . But Canadian airmen have had no counterpart in Canadian airplanes . During World War I Canada built 2,500 warplanes , but last year she built only 282 machines for a gross of $4,001,622 , most of them U. S. models built under license ( Lockheeds , Grummans , Piper Cubs ) . Next year it may be different . <P> Before Munich the British Air Ministry cast its eye about for a source of Empire-built aircraft out of the reach of Hitler 's bombers . The Ministry 's eye fixed on Canada . The week before Chamberlain and Daladier signed away the life of Czecho-Slovakia , the Dominion got a new company : Canadian Associated Aircraft , Ltd . It was formed with Government blessing to coordinate aircraft orders from Britain . All its stock is held by six Canadian aircraft makers . The six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Steel Car Corp. , Canadian Vickers , Fleet Aircraft , Ottawa Car &; Aircraft . <P> Because Canadian Associated 's job was to organize an industry as well as to parcel out orders , it got as its president not an airplane pilot but a seasoned businessman : aristocratic , 60-year-old Paul Fleetford Sise , onetime overseas infantry officer who had worked for Westinghouse before becoming president of Canada 's Northern Electric Co. and board member of many another Canadian company . <P> Shortly after it was formed , Canadian Associated got from the Air Ministry a $10,000,000 educational order for two-motored Handley Page Hampden bombers . Before the war started , Canadian Associated , foreseeing business ahead , began constructing two assembly plants , in Toronto and Montreal . Last week , while fuselages , wings and landing gears were coming off the old assembly lines ( to be set up later in the Toronto and Montreal plants ) , it was announced at Ottawa that negotiations were about complete for new British war orders to Canadian Associated . The first order was whispered to be for $20,000,000 worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. aircraft industry , Canadian Associated 's orders , on the book and in prospect , would be nothing to go into a barrel roll over . ( Seven U. S. builders have backlogs of over $20,000,000 each ; two , over $60,000,000 each . ) But the Canadian industry probably will have plenty to do in digesting the amount of business available . <P> Today Canadian aviation 's chief problem is to tool its factories , to train workers to get into swift , economical production . In addition to the six companies owning Associated Aircraft , Canada has six lesser independents . But no Canadian plant employs more than 1,500 men ( biggest U. S. employer : Martin , with 12,600 ) and no Canadian manufacturer is willing to expand his plant unless the expansion is underwritten by orders in hand . <P> Even if Canada gets only the drippings from the British order spigot , the Canadian aircraft industry has growth ahead . If the war lasts long enough and orders are big enough , Canada by war 's end will not in future have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
