Progressives at Madison <P> In 1854 , in Ripon , Wis. , a group composed of abolitionists and nationalists met to form the Republican Party , which , though it has elected 13 Presidents , is the only U. S. third party which ever elected even one . <P> Last week , University of Wisconsin 's tanbark-floored livestock pavilion at Madison was the scene of a mass meeting which may or may not become retrospectively as important to U. S. history as the convention in Ripon . Into the pavilion swarmed some 5,000 invited guests , for whose benefit its interior had been deodorized , its gallery strung with U. S. and Wisconsin flags and with banners bearing the strange device of a cross within a circle , a new American shibboleth . Ushers were Wisconsin football players wearing red sweaters with huge white Ws . Originator , organizer and chief speaker at the meeting was Wisconsin 's bespectacled 41-year-old Governor Philip Fox La Follette , whose supporters last spring ousted from the University 's presidency Mr. Glenn Frank , the man who is now engaged in preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Follette 's purpose was to launch a national political organization with the definite political objective of electing a bloc of Congressmen this fall , with the probable objective of electing himself President in 1940 . His means were : 1 ) a two-hour speech broadcast all over the U. S. , and 2 ) a manifesto of the new National Progressive Party of America 's principles . <P> Father &; Sons . In the brief and not particularly glorious record of U. S. third parties since the War , the La Follette family has played a big part . Wisconsin 's famed , white-maned Senator Robert Marion La Follette Sr. ran for President on an independent Progressive ticket in 1924 , polled nearly 5,000,000 votes . Since his death in 1925 , La Follette Progressivism has been ably carried on by his two sons- conscientious dapper " Young Bob , " 43 , who went to the U. S. Senate in 1925 to fill the unexpired term of his father , and Philip , who has been elected Wisconsin 's Governor in 1930 , 1934 and 1938.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
