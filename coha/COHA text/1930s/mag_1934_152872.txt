On the special Long Island R. R. trains that ran out from Manhattan in 40 minutes , orchids were peddled instead of candy , cigarets or papers . At Meadow Brook , F. Ambrose Clark appeared , as is his custom , in a black-and-yellow tallyho . Famed Poloist-Comedian Will Rogers , just back from a round-the-world trip , motored straight to Meadow Brook to greet the members of the West team that had already lost one game in the two-out-of-three polo series against the East . Said he : " It 's all right , boys , I 'm here . ' ' <P> But it was not all right.Trying to save a goal , West 's Back , Elmer Boeseke , hit a shot toward the sideboards which caromed off his pony 's fore foot straight through his own goal for the first score . The equality between young , lively Easterners and heavier , more experienced Westerners grew increasingly apparent thereafter but the enormity of Elmer Boeseke 's mistake was revealed when the game was over . The Scoreboard on the clubhouse showed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; series , East 14 , West 13 . <P> Modelled after the late Harry Payne Whitney 's famed ' ' Big Four ' ' which won the international matches against England in 1909 and coached by the " Big Four 's " famed Back , Devereux Milburn , the team that played for the East last week was built around its No. 3 , tall , brawny , 27-year-old Winston Guest , second cousin of Britain 's Winston Churchill . After last week 's game young Winston Guest did not even wait for dinner before rushing to town with his bride , Helena McCann Guest , to tell the New York Young Republican Club about his three ambitions for 1934 : " To marry Helena . ... To help win the East-West polo series . . . . To win the election in the 19th State Senatorial District . . . . "
