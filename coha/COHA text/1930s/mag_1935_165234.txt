A mighty crashing and crackling , rumbling and rending reverberated one day last week in a lecture room of Manhattan 's New York University . In from the hall burst a goggling student with a stammered message : <P> ' ' The students in the next room ca n't hear their professor and he would please like to know what all the racket is ! ' ' <P> ' " That , " said Dr. Edward Elway Free , chemist , physicist , consultant , lecturer , " is just a few young weevils trying to eat their way out of these wheat kernels here . Perhaps we can quiet them a little . " <P> Dr. Free was demonstrating a new amplifying device which he and N. Y. U. 's Carl Johnson had developed . The microphone frame was vertically dipped in a cup of weevily wheat which had previously been warmed to rouse the larvae to activity . The vacuum tubes were specially constructed to furnish a high constancy of current flow , eliminate all noise except the minute munchings of the weevils in their microcosms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber-mounted metal case . When a container of wheat free of weevils was substituted for the infested grain , the apparatus remained silent . <P> A cat 's purr magnified on this scale , Dr. Free asserted , would be heard for 3,000 miles around . But the loudspeaker to produce such a volume of sound does not exist . Western Electric 's new loud-speaker-used for the first time at last summer 's America 's Cup yacht races ( TIME , Oct. 8 et ante-multiplies the power of the human voice a millionfold , delivers thunderclap announcements with the force of 50-lb. hammer blows , makes itself heard for miles &; miles in still air . Even so all but a few of the most intelligible speech frequencies must be filtered out , so that the words , though understandable , remain distorted .
