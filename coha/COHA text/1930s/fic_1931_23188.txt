IN A WINTER DUSK A STORY BY PAUL HORGAN H OW long the afternoon had seemed , and how empty ! The pale filter of the sun 's light through the wayward snow turned a yellow haze upon everything it touched . The far line of the low hills , with the trees marching on their crests in black ranks , the fall of the little valleys to the hollow where the river ran under ice , the hard edges of the farmhouses and the cluster of the village , all looked flat , like brushed planes in a picture . It seemed to her that the travel of the sun behind its sad obscurity was endless . For a long time she had sat , staring out the window , her book resting on her knees , her chin upon her hand . Basil was restless . She turned to look at him when the snow flashed away from the resistant white window , and she knew he was uneasy and as undirected as the flakes in their fall . The short brown oval of her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profound , held none of the wise light that he had come to love so deeply . Her distress was familiar , for it made her pale , as she always was when she was very happy or very excited . Her mouth looked infirm , its pointed lips wet with the moisture of anxiety , which he had known before as a token of passion and wit . The long drawing-room was dusky , even in middle afternoon , and they regarded each other in its shadowswith a strange hostility . The room was finished in white , and its deep dark chairs and its long tables with the plain lamps changed its charming known aspect under the gloom of the winter and the fear that they both cherished helplessly . They could hear Miss Martin upstairs , moving around at her duties . " Perhaps I had better go up , " said Lydia after a pause , looking at Basil with an expression of wonder . He came over and pressed her head with his hand . " There 's nothing to do ; he said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything till this evening . " She lowered her head . it seemed to him that she wanted to displace his touch . He took his hand away and smiled- " Bal , " she said , using the nickname she had for him , " you sound pretty indifferent . " " Now that 's not kind , Lydia . " She recognized the cruelty of her words . " I know . I ca n't think straight about anything . " Miss Martin went into the hall upstairs and walked along to the sitting room . Her heels made a small noise , and her walk suggested that she was a nurse , going on an errand . Lydia stood up . " She should n't leave him , for a minute , " she said , " I 'm going up . " Basil took her arms and pushed her gently back to her chair . " Listen , darling , " he said ; " if you go up there you 'll only feel worse . " The picture of little Bill lying in his small bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sickness , came to both their minds . He seemed so ill , they thought , searching each other 's gaze , his cheeks were so flat and hot , and his hair turned so curly under the heat of the fever . He was three years old and beautiful with the tokens of his father and mother both . He had her dark face and body and her clear eyes with those suggestions of humor and mind . And he had Basil 's straight nose , in small mimicry , and a sense of attitude and gesture that amused them both tremendously . It was so touching a miniature of the things they loved best in each other that the baby 's danger and his silence and his look of strangeness frightened them for themselves as well as for him . Lydia opened her book petulantly and lighted a cigarette . But when she tried to read it was an effort to travel with the sentences . She threw down the book , turned and told Basil irritably to come away from sitting in the window seat . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and said nothing , then picked up a book and put it down again . " Why do n't you work ? " she asked . " At least you could try to forget . " He replied , with poor spirit : " I ca n't get hold of anything . " " Oh , my heaven , Basil , that 's such nonsense ! If you have anything at all to say in writing , you can say it any time . 1 think it might cut you loose ; it might give you an explosion of feeling to write now . And it 's exactly what you need . You 're tight , you 're empty . It makes me furious to see you ignoring your talent with thosenoncommittal things you 're doing . . . . You have n't touched anything since before we were married that compares with the things you ticked off then . " Her eyes had assumed their old burn , and her mouth taunted him with its fury and its sweetness . This tirade placed him in a void of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is overstrained . Little Bill is killing her . She does n't mean it . But , touched and made guilty by his look , with his blue eyes puckered in hurt , and his hand brushing his brown hair , Lydia had a perverse distaste for his irresolution . " There 's no use wasting words in praise , Bal , and you know it . It makes me sick to see you pounding away at story after story , with all your richness inside and none coming out . I do n't know what in God 's name is the matter . 1 know , as your wife and your lover , that you 've got it . It 's the same thing that ought to work in your writing , and it does n't . I appreciate it , God knows , at night . But I want you to . . . " She held her breath and shook her head , arresting that angry rush . Basil was blushing deeply with amazement and distress . " Well , I try , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genius from me which , if I 've got it , will be long in shaping . Pm not a brilliant writer . But I may some day be a solid one . " She shook her head . " Oh , rot , " she said . " It goes way down farther than that . It goes down to you . " She turned to stare through the white glass at the black and yellow and gray country outside . " It sounds as if you were attacking my whole integrity , Lydia , " he said with a patience that hurt her more than a curse . " You know I believe in you , " she answered , with tears in her eyes . " I doubt it . " She turned very fast . " Bal ! That 's damnably unkind . " " You have established my secondrateness in a few well-chosen words , " he said , with his first note of bitterness . " Oh , Bal , my dear , you 're such a fool , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a complete person , all yourself . .. like Nat O'Malley or Christine . " Basil said : " O'Malley is a better example . One that appeals more to you . " " Well , Nat has been successful because he is a good man at his trade , but more than that , he knows how to put himself all into it . " " The bedside manner , " said Basil , going back to sit in the window seat and watch the eclipse of the fogged day by the reddening cast of the sun moving toward the sharp trees on the hills . " I hate these sessions of frankness . " " You 're afraid of them , then , " said Lydia , " and if you ca n't stand it , that 's a weakness and a big one . " Basil chewed his finger idly , trying to look absorbed in the countryside . But in his heart there was a feeling that Lydia and Doctor O'Malley shared a casual understanding which was more precious than his with her because of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by passionate memories and futures , or else they were preoccupied in their tasks . He told her some of this feeling in words . He saw that it gave her the most acute concern , for her eyes grew dull again , and she shook her head , her mouth trembling , and her head uneasy with fatigue where she rested it on the back of her chair . The whole afternoon was exhausting . Little Bill ; the clicking of Miss Martin at her terribly futile work ; the fact that O'Malley did n't come , though he had promised to be in around three ; Lydia 's strange agitation , taking an angry , personal , almost evil line ( he thought ) ; and the discomfort which the long , handsome room gave for the first time since they had contrived it for their happiness . . . ? Their hostility was arrested by Miss Martin . She came in firmly , with her starched skirts whistling as they rubbed . " Mrs. Vane , " she said , " the temperature is the same as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Lydia , frowning . " Yes , he 's asleep . I had to give him another injection . I thought I 'd better , about an hour ago . " Lydia sucked her breath . The poor little boy , amazed at this sudden withholding of air from his lungs . Basil watched the nurse idly and , with Lydia , he played the game of being married , so that the woman , with her wide face and her nose glasses and chain , would n't suspect any bitterness downstairs . They both felt more or less normal , while Miss Martin stood , smoothing her hip and its starch with a dean , shapeless hand . " Doctor O'Malley is coming soon , I imagine , " said Lydia . " I do wish he 'd hurry . " Miss Martin stared through her placid lenses . " I do n't think there 's any change ; he 's resting quietly , " she said . Lydia knew the futility of trying to talk with this woman in anything but a professional tone . She nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had whipped itself up the stairs , the wave of estrangement rolled over them again . It was worse for its brief confinement under convention . They both felt bitter , they felt divided , and Lydia 's sweet attempt , with a kiss , to excuse them both all their sins was a pitiful failure . Basil turned from her , knowing she was wise , and that he was not , and that the temper of the afternoon 's weather was not responsible for the hot talk between them , and that neither little Bill 's danger nor the fury of their love in the past had the value of the commonplace to suggest permanence or steadiness . The snow continued to tremble down to the darkening ground . Basil went out to the porch , leaving her inside poking the logs in the wide fireplace . After a brief draw of the wet air into his mouth , he walked up the little hill behind the house to the stable . The straw smelled sharp and soft ; the sudden thump of a hoof on the wooden floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stroked the horse , murmuring heavy nonsense to it between lips tightened with affection , and listened to the murmurous shift of the snow , falling , falling , with tiny intimate noises like breath upon the thin roof of the stable . Lydia turned quickly from the logs , from arranging the ashes , dismissing the hot smell of them from her , and listened eagerly . The road up from the village ended at their door in a curve of gravel . With ice on it and packing snow , the wheels of a car made sharp press . O'Malley . The dusk was equal , now , inside and out . She could only sense the firs , marching on the distance and , looking out for his silhouette , she could see nothing but the graying shapes under the wet fall . But Annie came past her and went to the door . Lydia followed , and when the door swept open with its rush of the cold and the glistening air , she saw Nat standing there . She took his arm and drew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He watched her with a simple tenderness , in which his black eyes and his smile , young , under the short crop of his black hair , played an intimate meaning for her . " Oh , Nat , come right up , for God 's sake . " " Is he worse ? " asked the doctor , putting her arm under his own and walking with her . " I do n't know . I do n't know , but I am so frightened . " " But I told you , darling , that the little nubber 's fight is all on himself . We ca n't do anything really . . . I think he 'll make it . I truly do . " " Miss Martin says the temperature is the same . " They were going down the wide hall upstairs , with its walnut panels . At the door of the baby 's room they paused , and Lydia , taking hold of Nat 's arms , pressed them and looked up at him with the most appealing intensity . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice halved by his gentleness . She shook her head , and he watched the beautiful shape of her lip grow fuller in a sad , timid uncertainty . " Nat , I am in one hell of a way . " He leaned and kissed her on the forehead . She smiled , with a sudden return to calm , and dismissed his lips with a friendly laugh . In Bill 's room Miss Martin was bending over the little bed , watching , with an excitement suggested by her pose . Lydia whispered as if in a cry : " Martin , what is it ! " Nat lifted the nurse away and called for more light , and bent over the bed . Lydia 's heart turned within her , for little Bill lay there , his eyes wide open , his mouth , unutterably sweet in its open wonder , his chest rounding up and down with the noisy breath which was so reluctant . " Nat ! " O'Malley did n't answer . But he motioned to the nurse to give him a thermometer and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used his stethoscope . There was a sudden sense of activity in the white room , although nothing really was being done . Miss Martin stood looking hopeful , and Lydia , her hands on the post of the bed , stood thinking , I am in a bad way ; this is damned awful . Basil was coming from the stable at the moment Nat had the lights turned up . Outside , with the levelling dusk , Basil saw Bill 's window leap up , and he wondered . Then he went around the front of the house and saw Nat 's car , and the sort of peace he had been tasting out of doors , in that sparse , yet complete season , deserted him . Poor Lydia ! and poor little Billy . He hurried into the house and up the stairs . He could n't hear anything on his way but the metallic clink of basin and instrument . It was a noise that survived in his terror from his own childhood . He felt that his small son must be noticing those doctory noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin silent and busy . The treatment for the inflammation was simple and hopeful . That was all , he knew , they could expect . He tiptoed into the room , his face white from conjecture , and in a moment Lydia turned , and gave him a brief smile , to reassure him , and he loved her deeply for the idea it brought him that she was assuming the whole burden of this fright . She included him and Bill in her troubles . She was going to be strong . He adored women intensely , for she was their epitome . Then suddenly the situation relaxed . Nat sat , back , and Miss Martin took the things away , and Lydia sighed deeply , with a try at a smile . He saw Bill for the first moment then . The little shape was a dead weight on the mattress , and the face with its tender curves was empty of expression . The shockingly colorful eyes stared at him . Basil felt remote . " It 's one of those times .. . " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He stood up and said he wanted to smoke . Miss Martin accepted his instructions , and the rest of them went downstairs , feeling that everything had been done for the moment , and that the issue was as inevitable , whatever it was , as the fall of the sun behind the deep curtain of the snow upon the hills . Lydia arranged them in chairs before the fireplace , but Basil was up in a moment to say that they would all do well with a highball . He went to the dining room , working with glasses and ice which Annie brought him and the gold warmth of whiskey . When he returned , Lydia was laughing silently at Nat 's conversation , and he saw that she had been inspired by trust in the baby 's hope and Nat 's great assurance . " Lydia says her temper 's been foul all day , " said Nat , taking a glass . " She 's been an angel , " replied Basil , holding her drink to her . " Basil never gives me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humorously at him , " I have to be an angel all the time ; it grows very wearing . I had a harridan moment before you got here , Nat . I drove Bal out to the horses . " They smiled . But there was a wry air in the talk , and Nat turned to gossip , trying to shape the atmosphere . It failed . Lydia , overwrought , he was sure , was too easy with her eyes on him , and it made the pretense of his friendliness difficult . Basil regarded him with an understanding that was troubling , because it seemed to say , I know what it 's all about , and I do n't think there 's anything to be done about it except wait ; Lydia is loyal . But she is also a direct person . I can hope that she 'll get by this time , but I know you are fond of her , and I 'd almost rather have it admitted , here and now . " I 've about decided , " said Lydia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . Bal is absolutely aimless down here . " He turned to her . " Lydia ! " " You are doing nothing , " she said . Nat laughed . " My God ! Lydia , you ca n't deny him a slump now and then . " " I do n't mind slumps that have some weariness in them . But he 's nervous and fussy . He wants to work and wo n't . " " She has theories about me , " said Basil . " I dare you to deny what I told you . " The fire curled and disappeared in little flames among the resinous smoke . They were suddenly speechless . Nat was deeply annoyed . It was another of the awkward moments that they three had had several times lately . Basil probably knew how she felt , and he surely resented her strict loyalty more than he would a betrayal of it . The moment lasted so long that they could hear Miss Martin 's heels upstairs . Then Nat began to talk . " I 'm going to Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full shape was easy in the chair , and his amusing face , with its wide smile and likable eyes , assured them that he had solved their trouble . " But , Nat ! " " I 've had no vacation for two years . I want a couple of months of sunshine and foolishness and blondes . " " You 're an unfaithful dog , " said Lydia . " I never knew about this blonde business . " " Well , we 'll miss you like the devil , " said Basil . " I 'll send post cards . " Lydia was charmed with Nat 's tact , but wondered for a moment if it was n't a little too obvious to suit Basil , who , with his deep affection for her , was honest with her and himself . She was irritated , too . Nat would save the situation , but in doing so he was giving her an implicit farewell . Yet there wasalso a joy ; for , with him gone , the old feeling might come back to her and Basil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be more convenient so , if less exciting . Basil was frank with his relief , which he betrayed in the warmness of his words to Nat . " I do n't know what we 'll do without you , " he said . He leaned forward and put his hand on Nat 's arm , feeling contempt for suspicions he had held and realizing that they must have been without excuse . " I 'll not be going for a week or so , " said Nat . " By that time Billy should be all right . Then I 'll be off . The Werners are down there , and Kate wrote me to stop with them . But I 'll be damned if I 'm going to tempt heaven 's vengeance by fooling around with her . She 's awfully attractive , but she has no sense . Jack Werner does n't care , either . It would be too . . . " " Too younger married set , " said Lydia , " would n't it ? " They all laughed . Then Nat stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dinner . " Can you come back to us for dinner ? " asked Lydia . " Good gal , " said Basil . " Do come along back . " Nat shook his head . " I have to go to my sister 's to-night . She 's having some people down from the city . " They bundled him into his fur coat , and Lydia set his hat on him , and they took him to the door . They had a moment of complete intimacy at the door , which stood open , with the lamplight pouring out in a gold haze to the black wet of the porch and the last tokens beyond the trees across the village of the red , snowy sunset . The fresh snow was an aching smell , full of hints of past winter evenings ; and Basil and Lydia shivered with pleasant chill , and Nat smiled at them both with af-fection and wisdom . Then he turned and went down to his car , got in , and drove away . They watched for a moment his lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet stones . " It looks like Christmas , " said Lydia , with her pleasure in remembering her childhood and relating it to the present . Basil put his arm on her shoulders , drew her inside and closed the door . The long room , with the light from the widely spaced lamps , had its old look again , and Basil felt a return of happiness when they sat down near each other to read until dinner . They could hear , between the pages of their books , the pleasant sounds of their household , now private again : Annie moving around in the dining room with silver and glass and china , and , more remote , Bertha in the kitchen with slow fat movements , devising their dinner , and the hum of the electric plant in the basement like a reassuring monotone , and the hushing drip of the slow thaw from the eaves . Miss Martin was inactive , and Billy must be sleeping . Lydia reached for a cigarette , and she saw Basil , with his book idle on his lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had an immediate wish to comfort him . She leaned and kissed him , saying to herself that her only loyalty was to him , and to Billy  --  which was a part of the same . " Ca n't you see , darling , " she said softly , " that whatever I say , however I try to tell you when you 're being stupid , that I still love you ? " He stirred uneasily . " I did n't ever doubt it , " he said , patting her arm . " Whatever you 'd do , I 'd never doubt you . " " That 's generous , " she said , settling back again to her reading , in which the thought interfered that he took a lot for granted , or was really worried . The household sounds went on . Outside , the evening was repeating itscourse , with the six-thirty train whistling at the road , its call traveling with romantic sorrow over the frozen river and vanishing into the snow . Lydia looked up , then she stood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could . Basil lifted his head , and then Lydia ran to the door where the nurse stood , motioning her frantically to come upstairs . The two women disappeared , Lydia saying , " ' Phone Doctor O'Malley at once , call his sister 's house , Mrs. Tait , tell them to send him back here when he gets there . " Basil shook his head . The old fear took him by the belly ; he remembered vaguely its familiar gripe , and the fact that only an hour ago it had been always there , and that now it was back again . This sudden rush of Miss Martin , the clatter of feet on the stairs , the nurse 's voice on the upstairs ' phone , the hundred accents of catastrophe that he could n't separate at the moment , seemed to involve his whole life , and he got up heavily from his chair and started for Billy 's room . Lydia was kneeling by the baby 's bed , her arms about him , yet not touching him . Her head was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Martin was trying to get her connection on the country telephone line in the sitting room . It was a photographic moment , with everything arrested forever in a short picture . " I love you , " said Lydia in the saddest whisper he had ever heard . " I will never again deny it if you 'll come now ; oh , hurry . " The baby was blue in the shadowy places of his face , and Basil felt tears try his eyes and recede hotly as his son fought the air for breath . Lydia put her head on the bed , and murmured , " Oh , Nat . " Basil wanted to tell her gently that Nat would come , and that they would save whatever they could out of the tragic time . Miss Martin returned , and Lydia looked up , seeing her and Bal in the same glance . " Mrs. Tait says he will come as soon as possible , " she said , going at once to the kitchen for boiling water . Lydia nodded . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tears , and her mouth red and beautiful with her three sorrows , she shook her head at him . It was tender , and it was hopeless . She went back to the baby with her attention , and he leaned on the door-cheek , watching . She had shown him everything . Nat was the one ; Billy was the impulse . He felt never so lonely , and at any other time he could have gone furious , have reduced her to wifely obedience with his anger or his passion . But Billy lay between them and any protests . How complicated their hearts were , he thought . They were both suffering with every breath of the baby , they were both tender for each other 's distress . He was as much in love with her as ever , and she was impatient of him and affectionate , and drawn to Nat . Nat was going to save Billy , he adored Lydia ; who could say what resolution would come out of the mess ? Basil only knew that he must remain impersonal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce in his demand for Billy 's recovery  --  demand of God or what not . Leaning on the door , he saw with sharpened sight everything before him . It was a farewell that his gaze made , passing upon everything he loved . She knelt there , with the warmth in her heart declared by her pose , and he caressed in his mind the sweet places of her body that he had discovered so often and so passionately . He said to himself in a kind of agony of remembrance , that was cloudy and inexact except for its feeling , I love her forehead , it is so pure and shadowy ; her eyes , that look like pain when she laughs , and like laughterwhen she is hurt ; her mouth that moves like wild strawberries on their tiny stems ; her neck , which my hands have supported ; her golden body that has shadows where I could dream forever ; her voice which can make me strong or weak . He made a farewell without speaking a word , of which she would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remembrance of how often each had played the game of staring at the other until one of them had felt the regard and looked up . How strange it is , he thought , that I could easily laugh now , the way we have laughed so often . He sighed . " Basil ! " Lydia turned from the little bed , her eyes searching over him for signs of her betrayal . He smiled at her and shook his head . She patted the bed nervously with her hot hand , and then stood up , going to him , her tears frankly running now . " Darling , how long have you been watching ? " " A long time , Lydia . A long , long time . " She wrung her hands in a kind of primitive admission of her grief and her terror . Then , looking for the last refuge , she put her arms around him and let her head fall on his breast . He smoothed her hair , murmuring . He had said good-by , hating all good-bys . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A slender draw of cold air came through behind them , reminding them of the cold wet night outside , the unfriendly aspect of the black stones of the road , and the brittle cry of the trees , going nakedly up . " Nat thought he could fix everything by going away , did n't he ? " said Basil softly , looking at her with clear pity . Her black eyes , that snapped to temper or laughter with equal quickness , lighted . . - " Do you want everything very open ? " she said , putting her hand almost angrily on his arm . " We have always been honest , darling . " " That 's a marriage convention without anything behind it , " she answered firmly . Her tears stopped . He saw that she had gone to a control that kept her aware of the baby and of himself , and their strange confusions . " I heard you praying , " he said , " when I came up a few minutes ago . I said to myself , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I could behave as I ought to . But I know what you 're going through , " he said with a sort of plea in his voice , " I ca n't double it . " She began to weep again , shaking her head . Miss Martin came in with objects of her craft in both hands . She gave a suggestion of humming , to indicate how professionally occupied she was . Basil said to himself , Then our troubles are quite plain . Miss Martin knows all about it ; perhaps she knew before we did ! Lydia took his hand and led him to the hall . She closed the door after them . She stood straight to him , her breast near his own . " Little Bill is the thing in this whole world , " she said , " that I love best . If he dies I could never leave you . Never . I would know too much of what you 'd have to accept and suffer . " He felt himself get white with fear and astonishment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle , identifying it at once as a token of her deepest character . " Oh , my God ! " he said , looking at her . She shook her head at him , her brow clouding with familiar lumps of pity and horror . " But he must n't die , " she said , so softly he hardly heard . " Oh , for the love of Jesus , why does n't Nat come ! " She turned to go to the telephone . He was stirred to action . He took her elbow and made her face him again . Temper had come up in him , his face was red , and insistence lay bated in his throat . " Listen , " he said , " Lydia , my dear , what if Bill recovers ? Then what ? " She took breath into her chest . " Then I love Nat , " she said . " I 'd have to go . " " Thanks , " he said . " I only wanted a confirmation . I 've already said good-by to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh God , Basil , " she cried softly , " There 's only one thing you can wish . . .. Wait : I must telephone again . " She went down the dark recession of the hall . He stood leaning against the wood panels , listening to her controlled voice as she spoke to the operator . And in the same time , brief and endless in a strange dimension of meaning , he heard Nat 's car crush the black gravel on the road and stop . He heard the run and the jump up the steps , and the door bang open , ringing the crystal lamp on the table downstairs as it hit the wall . Nat ran up the stairs , dropping his fur coat on the banister . He nodded to Basil , and went in to Bill . Heads I win , tails you lose , said Basil to himself , pushing himself from the wall by wrenching his shoulder . He went to the library where Lydia was waiting at the ' phone . " He 's here , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran past him to little Bill 's room . He put the ' phone down , and sat in a doep chair , lighting a cigarette and pouring a long drink from the carafe on the table at his side . I will not get drunk , he said . He could hear small noises down the hallway , and he informed them in his mind with fatal meanings . But nothing , he thought , could be so final as the temper of Lydia 's mind , or the separation she her-self made between her heart and her will . He admired all that . All that made him ill and unhappy . He drank his whiskey , tasting none of it . Opposite him on the long table where he kept his picture books and portfolios there stood a photograph of the baby , laughing at him intimately . A swift triangle in his mind connected the happy , appealing picture and the terrible sounds down the hall and the times in his own childhood when doctory noises had made him cry without showing it . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and snapped off the single lamp beside him . He sat in the dark , with the faint square of reflected light from the hall falling through the doorway . His mind made pictures for him now . He refused to dwell on the outcome of the issue in the little bedroom . Either way he would lose a whole segment of life that had been woven to him with love and care . Instead , he found his thoughts playing around Nat , the least important of the helpless actors in his tangle . He found that he liked Nat , that he respected him wholly . He knew him to be a first-rate physician . Surely he would win again . . . He sat a long time in the dark . He felt remote when Miss Martin appeared in the doorway , leaning into his darkness and saying tentatively : " Mr. Vane ? Ah , Mrs. Vane and Doctor said they 'd be downstairs , and will you join them for a sandwich ? " He got up , stretching , turning on the light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Baby is a little better , " she said cautiously . " Doctor got his temperature down a degree and a half . " " Is that good ? " said Basil , following her . " Doctor said if he got it down at all , Baby would be safe . " " Then . . . " " We think so , " she said , smiling . " Doctor said from now on it would be another story . " Basil stopped at Billy 's door . He looked in . The baby was sleeping , looking ill and worn , but without the frightening remote look about him or the fight with small fists for pulse and breath . Basil 's eyes went tearful , his mouth shaped a caress across the white room . Miss Martin tapped and smoothed the covers , lightly and protectively . She leaned , looked at Billy , then smiled with satisfaction at her observation , and went on with her straightening of the room . Basil said to himself , Well , I see . He recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that filling fear . Billy was sleeping . . .. He was a beautiful child and , asleep , he always suggested to his father the time of his mothering and the love and the things in them both that would so inevitably be born all over again . With a strange sense of unwillingness to intrude anything upon Lydia 's relief and her self-promise of happiness , he nevertheless put his hands in his coat pockets , and went downstairs .
