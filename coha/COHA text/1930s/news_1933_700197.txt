txt Will Rogers , Farmer , Is a Little Mystified 2'o the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Calif. , Nov. 1 . ? Up in Dingville , Iowa , named for the great cartoonist Ding and sometimes called Des Moines , the farmers and the Governors are in convention . It do n't take a convention to tell that the farmers are in a bad plight . The speeches were all made by farm leaders . Now what is a farm leader ? I was raised on a farm . We had farm hands , farm hired girls , farm horses , farm mortgages ( not many ) but I never saw a farm that raised farm leaders . This leader thing is a type of growth that has sprung up since everybody started joining organizations , not only in farming but in everything . In the old days if you was smart enough to be in a business , you was smart enough to tend to your own business without listening to a leader make a speech . Yours for less leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
