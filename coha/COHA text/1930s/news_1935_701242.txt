txt Babe Ruth received his unconditional release as a member of the Braves tonight from President Emil E. Fuchs after a day of strife in the Boston club 's office , during which the Bambino announced his intention of requesting permission to go on the voluntary retired list . Professing himself to be highly satisfied , Ruth announced that he would return to New York and " look around for a job . " He was emphatic that he meant to stay in baseball . After confirming the release of Ruth , Fuchs issued a statement declaring that he was looking for some " reliable sportsman " to take over the club on an agreement not to release certain valuable players and to protect the small stockholder . Both Fuchs and Ruth agreed in interviews giving their sides of the controversy that the trouble in the Braves ' camp has been growing for some time . Fuchs said that Manager Bill had requested that Ruth be released several days ago and that he had denied the request . Ruth said he had been " doublecrossed " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball writers at Braves ' Field when he first announced that he would ask to go on the voluntary retired list . But while there have been rumors of trouble between the Babe and Fuchs and friction between the player and Manager , the " blow-off , " as Ruth expressed it , came when Fuchs refused permission to allow him to attend the Normandie celebration in New York on Tuesday night . The club president 's decision , backing that of Manager , was that Ruth should stay with the club , which is scheduled to meet the Brooklyn Dodgers here on Tuesday and Wednesday . The Babe 's idea was that as he is suffering with a threat of water on the knee anti ca n't play ball anyway , it would be a good thing for him to attend the celebration and gain publicity for the club and baseball . The Babe tonight confirmed the story of his quarrel with Judge Fuchs as follows : " Yes , I have just received my unconditional release from the Braves and I am mighty glad of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blow-off came today when Judge Fuchs refused my request that I be allowed to go to New York Tuesday night for the Normandie celebration . I told him I would ask to be placed on the voluntary retired list and later they gave me the release . " Here is my argument . I 've got a bad leg , threatened with water on the knee unless I keep off it and ca n't play ball . We have an exhibition game scheduled for tomorrow . I 'm willing to go and hobble around in that to please the crowd . The game and my appearance have been advertised for a long time ? and the Braves need the money . Tells of Doctor 's Advice . " But I am not fit to play in a league game . They can get along without me and I should n't try to work till Thursday or Friday , the doctors tell me . " So when I received this special invitation to attend the Normandie celebration as the representative of baseball I thought it would be a great honor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I attended . This comes Tuesday night . Inasmuch as I could n't play ball on either Tuesday or Wednesday , I believe that I can help more by representing baseball at a big thing like that than sitting on the bench . " When I put it up to the Judge he said , ' Nothing doing ! ' So I decided then and there that I would ask to be placed on the voluntary retired list and get away from the Braves . When they came along later with the unconditional release I was much better satisfied . And then later along comes a message that I will be excused from playing in the exhibition in Haverhill tomorrow . That 's a laugh . " Now I 'll go to the Normandie celebration on Tuesday night , and represent baseball  --  but not the Braves . Then I 'll look around for a job in baseball . No , I 'm not going on the retired list . I 'll take my time , but I hope to stay in baseball all my life . " Fuchs Gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full release to Ruth after the latter had made his statement to the writers . The decision was not announced until after Fuchs had conferred by telephone with President Ford Frick of the National League in New York and told him that the papers in the case were on their way . Fuchs said : " I have given Babe Ruth his unconditional release as a player and he is through with the Braves in every way . " Ruth will be dropped as vice president at once . He never had any financial interest in the club , so there is nothing to be straightened out there . " Two days ago I refused a request of Manager that Ruth be released . Matters on the club had reached such a state that the manager felt that no progress could be made in getting together a winning club with him as a member . I wanted to keep Ruth , as I felt the fans still desired him in the line-up . Wanted to Make Trip . " The matter came to a head today when Ruth requested permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome to the Normandie. felt , and I agreed with him , that Ruth 's place was here , as we have games with the Dodgers on Tuesday and Wednesday . " When permission was refused , Ruth did not take the refusal in a sportsmanlike way at all , but declared that he would ask to be placed on the voluntary retired list . I did n't want that , so I unconditionally released him . " His statement that I ' doublecrossed ' him is hard to understand . He blames me for writing a letter in- which I said I had lost a large sum of money with the Braves so far this year . That was the truth , and I told him that if he thought I had double-crossed him by writing the truth it would have to stand . " I can not see where Ruth bas any complaint over his treatment .. He had an agreement with me which would have been carried out and placed him in charge of the club . He knew he would have to work for this reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along like a good soldier . For the sake of discipline we could not give him the extra privileges he asked for . " Gives His Views . Manager said tonight that he had felt for some time that Ruth should retire . " I think that the Babe should have retired so that he would n't get hurt , " asserted . " I asked him recently to write his resignation . On May 12 after a game between the Braves and Cubs in Boston Ruth threatened to leave the club . On that occasion Judge Fuchs told Ruth that he should wait until he shook off a bad cold and leave while on top rather than at that time , when he was n't going well . " When he arrived home last Thursday from our western trip I told Judge Fuchs that Ruth could n't go on and that some action should be taken regarding his status . " For the first time since the announcement that Ruth was joining the Braves , when the Yankees released him last Winter , Fuchs re.vealed the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary for the year 1935 as player , plus a percentage made in all exhibition games and a percentage of the club 's earnings above the average earnings of the previous five years . The contract also stipulated that if the Babe was still with the Braves at the end of the 1935 season , " Ruth would have a chance to be manager . " Regarding his contract , Ruth declared that he would just let it cease . Hints at Player Transfers . Earlier in the day Fuchs made an announcement that the Braves would be made over , hinting at the transfer of certain players . He said : " I have spent two days with Manager and we have gone into the essence of what he believes to be the trouble with the Braves . " His recommendations involve some immediate changes , which we shall endeavor at the earliest possible moment to make , and would have made some time ago were it not that these changes would involve the transfer to other cities of the very players whom we both agree are efficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course is very evident to both of us , viz. : " To retain these efficient players and build the club around them . To do this requires additional capital . So far as I am concerned I am unable to provide such capital , as I have exhausted every personal financial means . Willing to Make Sacrifice . " I am willing to sacrifice the large equity I have in the Braves if some sportsman ( who will get his reward , in mY opinion , both financially and otherwise ) , or group of sportsmen , will come along and retain the outstanding players on our club , promise me they will not sell them to other cities , and that they will protect our small stockholders . " If this offer is not taken advantage of , along with Manager I will labor to do the best that 's in me to rebuild , with the hope that new faces , youth , spirit and speed may give us an opportunity for a better showing than we are now giving . " It was reported last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large amount of the Boston club 's stock held as collateral by Charles F. Adams , vice president and controlling stockholder . If he fails , Adams will insist on his resignation , it was stated , and will take control of the club . This turn of affairs would not bring Ruth back , however , for Adams has made the statement that he would keep as general manager and would only give Ruth a chance as playing manager after he " had proved his worth . " This probably means that Ruth 's baseball days have ended in Boston , where they began twenty-one years ago with the Red Sox at Fenway Park . Then he went to the Yankees for fifteen seasons of spectacular achievement between 1920 and MC Times Wide World Photo . Judge Emil E. Fuchs , president of the Braves .
