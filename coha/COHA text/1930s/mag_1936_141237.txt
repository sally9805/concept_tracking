The name of the biggest U. S. clockmaker has never appeared on the face of a U. S. clock-General Time Instruments , Inc . Last week for the first time this name appeared on the New York Stock Exchange . As unfamiliar to the average investor as to the average clock owner , GTI is known by its two chief subsidiaries , Western Clock Co . ( " Big Ben " ) and Seth Thomas Clock Co. of Thomaston , Conn . These two old family enterprises were put together in 1930 to form the company which now accounts for one-third of the entire U. S. clock business . Instead of celebrating this union with a stock party for the public , GTI merely swapped its shares for the holdings of the owning families , and until last April there were only 150 shareholders . <P> Then GTI offered these stockholders the right to buy 75,600 shares of additional common , the proceeds to retire some of its preferred stock and to bolster its cash position after clearing up dividend arrears on the rest . Of the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken up by a banking group headed by Kidder , Peabody &; Co. , which offered it to the public . Listing was the sequel to that offering . <P> Oldest of GTI 's two venerable subsidiaries is Seth Thomas , which dates back to 1813 when a young Yankee gathered tools and helpers to make grandfather clocks in Connecticut 's Naugatuck Valley . At first the parts were wooden and fitted only one clock . Later clockmakers shifted to brass and eventually evolved precision methods , interchangeable parts . Clock-making was the first real mass production in the U. S. No Connecticut craftsman built better than Seth Thomas I , few as well , and by 1853 he had sold enough clocks to organize a formal company with $75,000 capital , sizable money in those days . <P> Founder Thomas did not live to see his home town renamed Thomaston , but he left a good business and an honorable tradition to Seth Thomas II and other sons , who passed them on to Seth Thomas III and finally to Seth Thomas IV . The Thomases stuck to quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from delicate chronometers to the world 's biggest clock , installed in 1924 in Colgate-Palmolive-Peet 's Jersey City plant for the benefit of commuters across the Hudson River . Seth Thomas IV was president of his family concern from 1915 until the merger , when he became GTI 's board chairman . He sired two daughters but no sons . After his death in 1932 the clock industry was without a Seth Thomas for the first time in nearly a century and a quarter . <P> GTI still has plenty of timekeeping talent in the person of President Ralph H. Matthiessen , scion of the other GTI clock family . The first clock-making Matthiessen was a German immigrant with a Heidelberg education who made good with a zinc smelter in La Salle , Ill . He had an idea that clocks could be soldered together instead of riveted , at a great saving . In 1885 he founded Western Clock Co. near his smelter . His competitors called his Westclox line " lead clocks , " but they sold faster &; faster , and in 1910 Western made clock history by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
