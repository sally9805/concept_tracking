Jammed aboard the U. S. liner President Harding when she cleared from Le Verdon , near Bordeaux , France on Oct.11 were 597 passengers ( 157 more than her capacity ) , 330 of them U. S. citizens . West of Ireland , Captain James E. Roberts turned to rescue the French tanker W. Emile Miguet , which radioed that it had been attacked by a submarine . On his way to her rescue he picked up 36 members of the crew of the British freighter Heronspool , which had also been torpedoed . He finally found the Miguet in flames , could see no sign of the crew , and resumed his course westward . ( Word came later that the Miguet 's crew had been rescued by the Black Diamond freighter Black Hawk . ) <P> Roberts ordered the overcrowded President Harding hove to in mounting seas in the Stygian night of Oct. 17 . That he was in the vicinity of the hurricane , he knew . But British ships had ceased broadcasting weather reports , which might betray their location to submarines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might have enabled him to avoid it . The President Harding , now actually 200 miles east of the hurricane 's core , was suddenly buffeted by a no-mile-an-hour wind , floundered in a sea which rolled up into a single mountainous wave that struck her broadside . <P> On her high bridge , Roberts had time to glance aloft , see the sky blotted out by the crest of the wave before it broke over them , hurled men the entire length of the bridge . Small sounds in the Niagara thunder of the blow were the smashing of glass , furniture , superstructure , screams of passengers that the ship was going down , shrieks of the injured . <P> Cabin Boy Paul Johnson , who had just emerged from the " glory hole , " was swept overboard clutching a shipmate 's spectacles . Steward Schwerdtfeger grasped Mrs. William Buckler by one foot just as she was going over the rail . In the ship 's hospital Dr. Thomas Fister was sent spinning with bottles , instruments , in water up to his knees , staggered back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just removed . Paul van Zeeland , former Premier of Belgium , in his cabin with his wife and four children , was knocked unconscious . A kettle of boiling water and grease engulfed Fred Stover , chief butcher . Mrs. Tatiana Sztybel , refugee from the siege of Warsaw , was hurled against a wall like a rag doll , left moaning with a badly injured spine . In the smoking room , where water poured through shattered ports , men and women and furniture were piled in a jumbled heap while the precipitous floor turned slick with blood and water . <P> For what seemed minutes the 13,869-ton liner stayed down on her side , virtually at the point of capsizing , before she slowly righted herself and began a sickening roll . <P> It was almost dawn before the sea abated , the 73 most seriously injured administered to , black eyes , minor hurts treated , and the confusion partially unscrambled . Summoned by radio , the Coast Guard cutter Alexander Hamilton put medical supplies aboard by means of a rocket gun and line . <P> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into New York Harbor , flag at half-mast for Cabin Boy Johnson , and while three uninjured members of the ship 's band played The Sidewalks of New York , warped into her pier , where 18 ambulances waited , rushed 26 to hospitals . From her hold were removed 25 automobiles , most of them virtual wrecks , to be towed away .
