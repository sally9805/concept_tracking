txt The Supreme Court has affirmed unanimously a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit at Pittsburgh declaring the forfeiture of certain property , barrels , casko , cartons , and so on , possessed with the design of the illegal manufacture of liquor . The Court holds , as it has held before , that the Prohibition statute is to be construed liberally , with a view to its purpose , the suppression of the liquor traffic . So the word " manufacture " may be used loosely " to express the whole " process by which an article is " made ready for sale on the open " market . " Such apparatuses as corks , containers , and so forth are subject to seizure and forfeiture when " offered for sale in such a " mode as purposely to attract pur " chasers who wanted them for un " lawful practices as we interpret " the word . " Before any implications and extensions are drawn from this case , it should be remembered exactly what it was . The Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material designed for the illegal manufacture of liquor . The only point on which the Supreme Court permitted review on certiorari was the legality of forfeiting the property . This was the professional paraphernalia of what is alleged to be " a bootleggers ' supply house . " It is not necessary to go any further , for Assistant Secretary LOWMAN may be trusted to attend to what , if any , development of doctrine may be attained . The opinion was written by Mr. Justice Hor.mks . It contains one of those subtle and perfect phrases which he seems to utter instinctively and almost unconsciously , " the af " flatus of the Eighteenth Amend " ment . " What happier word , more stimulating to curiosity , of more various or iridescent interpretation , could have been found ? It will give pleasure both to Wets and Drys . To the latter it will . have the sense . of " inspiration , " " afflation of the divine spirit . " In short , it seems to attribute to the amendment exactly the origin which they ascribe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not trust mere English dictionaries . Wipe some of the dust off the Latin lexicon . Here is " afflatus " shining with a dry light : " a flash or glow of light . " But the other side has its inning too . " Afflatus " is " a blowing or breathing on , " " blast , " " breath " ? sometimes a particularly unpleasant breath , a noxious effluvium . The snake 's afflatus seems to have been unsatisfactory to the Romans , According to PLINY , " the " polypus drove off the dogs by his " terrible afflatus . " OVID exhibits gifted wild boars who " burned leaves by their afflatus . " The Latin word ought to be collected and studied in detail ' by specialists . Even in the present state of philology it is seen to be elastic and comprehensive . May not that proposed " truce " between Drys and Wets for a period of years be insensibly established by the substitution of " The Afflatus " for " The Eighteenth Amendment " ? We leave it to Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lovely and healing , metonymy.
