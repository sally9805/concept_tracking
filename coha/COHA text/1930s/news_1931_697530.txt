txt What Is described as " an unofficial exchange of views on financial questions interesting the two countries " was begun today here between representatives of the British and French treasuries . Those taking part in this " informal talk " were , on the British side , William Leith Ross , one of the foremost experts of the British treasury , who was for several years a member of the Reparations Commission , and , on the French side , M. EScallier , director of the French Ministry of Finance . Each had with him several assistants . Complete secrecy is being maintained about the character of the conversations , but from both the British Embassy here and the French Finance Ministry the following communiqu ? was issued at the end of the morning 's meeting : " Certain newspapers have published information , according to which an Anglo-French financial conference wilt open today in Paris . " Presented that way , this information is not exact . In reality certain important functionaries of the British Treasury who are in . Paris have profited from their presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of close collaboration which animates the two treasuries , an unofficial exchange of views on the financial questions interesting the two countries . " For Close Collaboration . The phrase in the communique which merits the most attention is that which emphasized the spirit of close collaboration which animates the two treasuries . For some time past it has been known here that , while personal and other considerations have interfered with the success of a scheme for mutual aid be- tween the banks of the two countries , the same obstacles have not existed between the respective governments . It will be remembered that during November the announcement was made that negotiations were then in progress for a large credit operation from the Bank of France to the Bank of England so as to halt the- steady flow of gold out of England and at the same time relieve the Bank of France , which was becoming more and more embarrassed by the increase hi its gold reserve . These negotiations were not as successful as was expected for a variety of reasons , many of which are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasury heads was in reality another attempt to solve the same problem . France Cuts Discount Bate . The Bank of France today , with the direct object of preventing the further flow of gold into this country from the United States , lowered its discount rate from 2% to 2 per cent , the lowest figure at which it has stood since 1895 . In the weekly statement of the bank there were some interesting figures . For the first time in history the bank 's engagements reached the record figure 100,758,000,000 francs , or more than $4,000,000,000 . Circulation increased by more than 1,000 , - 000,000 francs ( $40,000,000 ) , reaching the figure of 76,436,000,000 francs ( $3,057,440,000 ) . There was recorded a further purchase in gold during the past week of 293,000,000 francs ( $11,720,000 ) . The gold cover , however , fell , owing to the other factors cited , from 53.78 per cent to 53.17 per cent . Another interesting figure was an increase in reserves of foreign currency , due to the . continued necessity for the support of sterling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the situation of the Bank of France at the beginning of these conferences . The situation which the British negotiations are facing is , in all probability , a large budgetary deficit . They are also anxious to put a halt to the continued gold drain , Several Possibilities . With these two objects in view , several operations might be envisaged . ? The British Treasury is anxious to make a further loan conversion so as to effect an economy for its budget . Such a conversion would be considerably eased if business interests in England could be provided with access to capital on such terms as would enable the treasury to carry through its operation without the risk of having to redeem any large amount of the loan . That situation could be secured by opening credits here to a number of the most important British industries . At the same time the exchange rate of the pound " could be improved to a point which would discourage the shipment of gold In this way somewhat the same results could be obtained as were sought when the proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France to the Bank of England . Instead of being one operation , this proposal entails a number of credit operations , all on a very definite basis . There would be no credit from bank to bank , nor any direct loan from government to government . By extending credits to British business concerns , however , the French could first enable a large conversion in England with its consequent saving to the budget . Second , they could halt in some measure the flow of gold into France which is in some ways as embarrassing to Paris as it is to London . Third , they could provide secure employment for French capital , which is greatly to be desired . Finally , they could confer a material benefit on English industry . Other suggestions have been made during the past few weeks , but it is understood that today 's conversations paid special attention to the possibility of tie operations outlined here . Although , naturally , the gold situation was discussed , and is at the root of the whole situation , that problem is outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter for discussion between the banks at issue . If , however , the same results as the banks failed to secure can be effected by this more roundabout road , it is believed that it will be welcomed by each nation . In explanation of the lowering of the discount rate of the Bank of France , Le Temps ' financial editor writes this evening : " This measure is motivated only by considerations of an international character . It is sought to prevent in some measure the influx of gold from abroad which has 83 its consequence a continuous increase in paper circulation here . " This constant increase in paper circulation has been a basis of an- increase in retail prices in France while wholesale prices have diminished . The situation has indeed become so acute that the present government is making it one of its principal preoccupations , and behind today 's conversations the hand of both the British and the French Finance Ministers is clearly traceable ..                   @ @
