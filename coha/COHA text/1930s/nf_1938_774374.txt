It is written for the women of America , every one of whom is a decorator at heart , in the hope that it may help them to solve their everyday home furnishing problems . I have tried to keep it as fundamental in content and language as possible . This obviously precluded an aesthetic viewpoint or the introduction of the esoteric and the specialized in decoration . The only styles that are discussed are those that are readily available in reproduction to everyone in this country . The subjects are handled in the order in which they present themselves when you are actually decorating a room or a house . Ordinary maintenance problems , such as cleaning woodwork , fabrics and floor coverings are discussed because no home can be considered well-decorated unless it is kept clean . No one can write a book without assistance . My assistance has been the many books on the subject , both old and new ; my wife , Madeleine Maas , for suggestions and manuscript reading ; Suzanne Gleaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her help in indicating the most suitable method of presenting this material ; and Marion Gough , whose assistance was invaluable .  | FURNITURE arrangement is the basis of every decorative scheme . It bears exactly the same relationship to the room as a pattern does to a dress , a recipe to a cake , or a plan to a house . The cook who can produce an excellent meal without ever using a recipe has a rare talent . The woman who can instinctively arrange her furniture so that both it and the room look and function best has a rarer one . Even a woman who has a well-developed color sense and a knowledge of decorative styles will be at sixes and sevens when it comes to placing a new piano in her living room . The average woman will assemble her spring clothes with considerable care . She knows what colors , what materials , what cut best become her . In other words , she buys with a plan based on thorough knowledge of her physical traits , all clear in her head before she begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of years of experiment and self-training . She has not had the same background for furniture buying . You do n't get a new furniture wardrobe every year . You get one once or twice in a lifetime . So you are in danger of plunging in rather desperately , without forethought , when you buy for your house . You ought to attack the buying of furniture rather the way you attack the buying of clothes . That is , you must  | have a picture in your mind , in this case a picture of a room . Before you ever set foot in a shop , before you 've decided on period or style , you want to get perfectly clear in your head where you 're going to put what . Just as you decide first in buying clothes that you want one suit , two street dresses , an evening dress and an evening wrap ; decide that you need for your room one couch , two lounging chairs , three small tables , etc . The decision of what kind of each comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what pieces to get . It 's obviously ridiculous to buy any piece of furniture just because you happen to like it if you 're not going to have any place to put it when you get it home . Do n't order it till you decide whether it will fit into your decorative scheme , and where . By having a mental map of your room to buy to , you save more than money . The common method of moving a piece of furniture from one part of a room to another in the rather forlorn hope of finding a really good situation for it is not only back-breaking , but also heartbreaking . If you do manage by this savage method to install a satisfying group on one side of the room , the other will look either bare or cluttered . The way to beat this is to plan ahead , and the best way to plan ahead is on paper , before you have any substantial sums of money or stacks of furniture involved . The first consideration in furniture arrangement is the location of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only the first step in arrangement , it is the most important . The best way of doing this is on a floor plan drawn at a scale of one quarter inch equaling  | one foot . If your house is new you can easily get such a plan from your architect or contractor . If it is not new , you must make or have made a plan based on actual measurement of the rooms . This will probably seem difficult to the novice but actually it is both interesting and simple . one of the easiest methods of making this plan ( after the measurements are made ) is on a sheet of graph paper which may be bought at any stationery store . This paper is ruled off in one-quarter-inch squares . Let each square represent one foot . With a pencil draw in the outline of the room according to the squares on the graph paper . This plan should indicate the location and size of the windows , fireplace , doorways and other openings . Next make tracings of the scale furniture shown . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated but unless it is an unusual piece the difference will be slight . Cut out the tracings of the furniture and you will be all set to begin . Place the cutouts on the plan according to the way you think the room would look best . Try to keep the furniture parallel to the walls . If you place pieces diagonally , the plan becomes unwieldy and cluttered looking with gaping wasteful holes in the corners . After you have arranged your plan , study it for traffic arrangements , functional groupings , focal interest and general design . The automobile has made us all traffic-minded . We appreciate more and more the room that is planned for proper circulation . Passageways and door openings must be kept free from furniture . Barked shins are too  | high a price to pay for mere appearances . It is annoying for a maid to walk through a conversational grouping in order to answer the front door bell . The best solution to the traffic problem is to plan separate integrated groupings for definite functions . Modern design has brought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago we thought of our rooms in terms primarily of how they looked . Today we think of them in terms of how they work . To us comfort and beauty have become common ends . The best parlor , along with the dinosaur egg , is just an interesting relic . We are all aware of the value of our leisure time and we like to express our hobbies in our surroundings . Card-playing families no longer grapple with collapsible tables but have a permanent card grouping . Families with literary tastes group their furniture for reading and use their books for a decorative background . Most people who write , draw , paint or play the piano at home usually do these things in the living room and group their furniture to suit the demands of these avocations . If your living room is small they will obviously dominate the decorative scheme . In that case , the focal point is automatically established . If the room is large the work area would constitute but one of several groupings . A small living room generally should be treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large room the opposite is the best rule . Do n't make the mistake of trying to treat a room , say fifteen feet by twenty-five feet or larger , as one cozy little arrangement . Try instead to  | arrange your furniture so that there will be several intimate conversational groupings . These should consist not only of seating pieces but they must also have an adequate number of tables , lamps , ash trays and similar conveniences . If you follow this system your living room will have a comfortable , hospitable quality . You will also discover that by doing this you will automatically develop a dominant motif . Such a note does more than anything else to give a room real character . Every expressed idea must have its dramatic highlight . It may be the spotlight on a dancer , the inflexions of a persuasive speaker , a single accent of bright color on a black dress , or the dominant grouping of a living room . In each case it is merely a matter of emphasis , but emphasis in just the right place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one such dominant note . This we usually call either the focal point or the center of interest . Traditionally it is the fireplace grouping because once the fireplace was the only source of heat in the room and so became the center of household activities and social life . This romantic association remains despite central heating . However , today an important grouping before a window , between windows or doors or at any other point first seen by anyone entering the room serves as the center of interest . Usually it is wise to use one of your larger pieces of furniture as the nucleus of a grouping for focal interest .  | Thus you might place a sofa on a long wall facing the entry . Then put your best picture or mirror over it , flank it with tables and lamps and a pair of comfortable chairs . Make it important . Do n't just put the sofa in the chosen spot and let it go at that . You ca n't have a center of interest unless you have interest . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they emphasize the entire grouping as a fine composition . This is the most important grouping in the room and should instantly reflect the atmosphere of the decorative scheme . Incidentally , if your room is large , you might do well to try to develop more than one center of interest . It is characteristic of human nature to consider every personal problem unique . This seems especially true in decoration . Actually the range of room sizes and shapes , the number of pieces and types of furniture and the kinds of decorative treatments are relatively limited . It is possible therefore to condense furniture arrangement to a formula . However , it is not intended that this be a rigid formula , but rather a jumping-off place in handling your own problems . Each of these recipes can be seasoned to suit the taste of the individual . There are just a few rules that should be followed . Never overcrowd a room with furniture . Never let a piece of furniture interfere with another piece , with circulation , or with mechanical features . Never select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that convenience contributes to physical well-being . And above all remember that furniture should enhance the architecture of your home .  | Actually very few entrance halls are large enough to be considered rooms . Yet the entrance hall is decoratively important because visitors get their first impression of your home from it , and first impressions are lasting ones . It should always be considered as an introduction to your home . Entrance halls vary considerably in both size and shape . Usually of vestibule proportions , occasionally they are large enough to be treated as reception rooms . While the size automatically dictates the amount of furniture to be used , almost every entrance hall has room for at least a small console , chest or similar piece with ? and this is important ? a mirror over it . Mirrors , besides indicating that you are a thoughtful hostess , are invaluable as a means of creating the illusion of greater size in a small room . If your hall is large enough , flank the console or chest with a pair of small side chairs and add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain a reception room effect . So far as furniture arrangement for the hall is concerned , you can adhere to one sound rule : always place the furniture against the wall . If possible have the most important piece face the entrance door . This naturally creates a focal point . If you ca n't have it on the axis of the door , put it against the wall that is first seen by the visitor . In recent years , large foyers- called galleries have taken the place of dining rooms in many apartments They are often large enough to accommodate a dining table and from four to six chairs . A drop-leaf or extension table that can be easily placed against the wall when  | not in use , is best for this type of foyer . Some of the chairs may be used in the hall while the rest are kept in the living room . There are many interesting special solutions to this problem , such as a built-in bench against the wall , with a narrow table , always ready for use . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Living rooms are the problem children of arrangement . There are several reasons for this . In the first place , the living room must combine more different living functions than any other room in the house . It is not only a common meeting place for the family , but it must be used for entertaining visitors . For most of us , it is at once a study and a social center , a library and a music room , and a place for conversation . It is also the only room in the house that is used throughout the entire day . Some living rooms have sufficient wall space and others seem all doors and windows . Some are square rooms and others are long and narrow . Sometimes the fireplace is on a long wall and sometimes on the short . Do n't throw up your hands in despair just because these problems require a little extra study to get a good effect . Plan before you buy . Fortunately living-room furniture is available in a great many sizes and shapes . After all , remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual items of furniture . Every living room should have at least one upholstered sofa , a few comfortable chairs , some smaller ones that can be moved about easily , a fairly large table , and a sufficient number of small tables for lamps and other conveniences.  | Normally the fireplace serves as a logical jumping off place in planning furniture arrangement . These four rooms , identical in size , have approximately the same amount of furniture , yet each seems different than the others . In the rooms at the top the fireplaces are on long walls . In one case ( top left ) the sofa is placed on the wall facing it and two easy chairs flank the mantel . In the other ( top right ) the sofa is at right angles to the fireplace . Where the fireplace occurs on a short wall , the sofa may be free , standing and facing it ( bottom left ) , or against the wall but near the mantel ( bottom right ) .  | In planning the furniture arrangement , dispose of the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . This means taking advantage of the spaces created by balanced doors , windows and breaks in the wall surface , such as bookcases or niches . You should first consider the placing of the sofa . If the room is over thirteen feet wide and has a fireplace , the sofa should be placed in front of the fireplace or at right angles to it . If the room is smaller , the sofa should be placed against the wall , either facing the mantel or to the side of it . If you have no fireplace , try to place the sofa near an important window . Never place a sofa diagonally in a corner unless there is no other possible solution . If this is the case , buy a curved piece of furniture . Once the sofa is successfully located , begin to arrange some of the chairs near it for a conversational grouping , for on this depends much of the social success of your room . Work out your grouping of chairs so as to eliminate the ballroom seating effects that dampen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another large piece of furniture , such as a break-front bookcase , secretary , highboy or chest , it must be disposed of next . Keep in mind the achievement of a symmetrical balance by using to the fullest extent the architectural background . The placing of these large pieces of furniture will make or break your room . They must occupy central positions in relationship to the wall areas . Unless your room is unusually large , never place a large table in the center of it . Try placing the table along the wall , near the entry or opposite the sofa , completing the grouping by a side chair at each end . If you have both a piano and a small room there is  | not much choice of location for the piano . In a larger room it should be placed in a corner with the curved side facing into the room . It should be left unadorned . Fringed scarves and ornaments make the piano overly conspicuous and detract from the natural elegance of the instrument . Tables , magazine racks and similar secondary items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair adequate space for good lighting and convenient access to ash trays , cigarette boxes , and so forth . But these necessary little tables must be placed so that there will be free passage from one part of the room to another . There can be neither beauty nor utility in a room that does not function smoothly . The secretary type of desk has limited possibilities for placing , since it demands a wall and must be near a window . For the flat-topped desk there are a number of arrangements . It may be placed at right angles to a window or a wall where the light will come over the left shoulder , directly in front of a window , or , if the room is large enough , standing free from the wall as desks are usually placed in well-furnished offices . In general , you can express your own individual taste more perfectly in the living room than in any other room in the house . Do n't try to overcrowd the room , but , on the other hand , do n't try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire problem as a job of grouping for use , your room will be successful . Dining-room tables are traditionally placed in the center of the room . If you have a bay or equally im- portant window with a good view , it might be desirable to ignore this tradition and place the table near the window . Another good idea is to center your large table and place a smaller table for breakfast , lunch and other small informal meals near the window . It is always best to locate the sideboard , dresser or china cabinet on the center of the long wall . The serving table should always be placed near the pantry door . If you wish to have corner cabinets , always buy two for a symmetrical arrangement . If yours is a combination livingdining room , treat the end near the kitchen door just as you would a real dining room . Usually there is not much choice of location for a double bed in the average bedroom . However , there are several solutions to the problem of twin beds . They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches apart with a night table between , they may be placed together so that they seem to be one bed , or they may be placed on opposite sides of the room . If the room is very long and narrow , they can be used lengthwise on the long wall with a night table dividing the headboards . Several important points should be taken into consideration in locating a bed . A bed should never be placed so that the sleeper faces a window when lying down , nor should it ever be placed in a direct draught . A bed should never interfere with traffic between , say , a closet and the bathroom . Never center one on the wall of a small room , since this tends to make the room seem even smaller . Always have night tables with lamps convenient to the beds.  | Twin beds lend themselves to a variety of arrangements . ( Above left ) Both beds placed against one wall with headboard to headboard for the narrow room . ( Above center ) Beds placed against opposite walls . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night table between . ( Lower right ) Placed together so as to seem one piece . ( Lower center ) Twin beds placed to form a corner sofa . Chests , dressers and chiffoniers should be conveniently located . A dressing table is best placed near a window because it should be as well lighted by daylight as by artificial light . Arrange chairs , chaise longue or sofa in such a manner as to develop an integrated grouping . It is preferable to have such a grouping in a corner near a window .  | Here again the furniture should be placed against the wall so that the center area will be adequate for play . A bed , shelves for toys , a chest , a small table for eating , some small chairs and a large chair are all the furniture necessary . It is wise to place the furniture so that the room areas are divided for function . This is sound psychology and will help to develop in the child a fine sense of order . Low shelves should be built for toy storage since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursery . Rooms of this kind are usually found in the basement of a house . Their decorative scheme is invariably dictated by the types of games to be played in them . Seating furniture should be placed near the walls in groups so that the center of the room may be used for dancing or ping-pong . If you are a card-playing family , several permanent card-table groupings will prove a boon . We have been concerned so far in this chapter with furniture arrangement only as it relates to one plan of the room , the floor . However , since floor plan is actually the backbone of interior composition , if your furniture is well arranged on the floor , it should be automatically well arranged in relation to the walls . , Since there are usually four walls to a room , each wall should be studied as an individual problem which  | between verticals , or a vertical between horizontals . Another important consideration is the visual effect of curved and straight lines . If all the furniture in your room is straight-lined the effect is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect is a little like melting butter . Try to arrive at a happy combination of both . Proportion is another important element in room design . It , however , is something which is entirely a matter of visual reaction . The eye is very sensitive to furniture that is either too large or too small for the surrounding area . Although many people are unable to analyze the reason for dislike for certain rooms , it is usually improper scale that offends them .  | OUR homes today reflect the evolution of design during a period of several hundred years . We glibly refer to Chippendale , Sheraton and Hepplewhite as if they were contemporaries . We talk in the loosest possible manner of our Colonial , Georgian and French Manor houses . We forget that actually we have only selected and adapted certain design motifs which we have veneered to otherwise modern houses and pieces of furniture . Many people own antique furniture , but very few have either a complete house or even a complete room that is a reproduction of an old one . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles of earlier times . We know that the reproduction is best for a museum , the adaptation for a home . Taste is a strangely nebulous quantity . It involves not only visual reaction but visual experience and a definite emotional reaction . Consequently styles in dress , architecture and decoration clearly reflect a people and their time . Our eclectic tastes indicate a preoccupation with material things , a sense of mechanical inventiveness . Design with us is usually a self-conscious afterthought . The pompous court life during the reign of Louis XIV is clearly reflected in the questionable beauty of gilded sunbursts used indiscriminately on the furniture of his time . A greater intimacy , grace and intellectuality in  | design mirrors the court of Louis XV , while the furniture named for Louis XVI shows sophistication substituted for the vigor and rhythm of its predecessor . Decoration of the Queen Anne period reflects the shift of influence from the court to the middle classes in England . And so it goes in an endlessly fascinating way . The social conditions of a time influenced not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual furniture arrangement . Therefore , during the excessively formal times of Louis XIV all furniture was placed against the wall . In consequence , all design emphasis was placed on the front of the piece while the backs in most cases were left unfinished . In the less formal times of the late Georgian period furniture was arranged in intimate groupings such as we have today . As a matter of fact , we have an especial affinity for the periods which approximate the conditions of our own times . Human nature is quick to find what is most sympathetic to itself and recognizes it without the least difficulty . However , we will sometimes let publicity or admiration for someone else 's home color our judgment in selecting our own furnishings . The result is often disastrous . It is self-evident that furniture originally intended for sophisticated court life has no business being in the small  | suburban home of a family with young children . On the other hand , a smart young couple living in a New York penthouse need take no such practical considerations into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time we are able to look at decorative styles objectively and catalogue them according to what they represent in our lives . In some cases we have merely adapted certain things to our needs and ignored the style as a style . The following analysis of commonly usable period styles that are commercially available may clarify for you your reaction to various traditional forms . Jacobean , masculine and substantial , most suitable for libraries , dining rooms and occasional pieces for living rooms . Queen Anne , simple , substantial and unaffected , most suitable for living rooms and dining rooms . Chippendale , dignified , rich and unostentatious , most suitable of all furniture styles for any room . Adam , Sheraton , and Hepplewhite , gracious , urbane and delicate , suitable for small living rooms , dining rooms and bedrooms .

Peasant , gay , suitable for a week-end or summer home . Every so often an esoteric old style will be revived . Newspapers and magazines will start promoting it to the exclusion of everything else . Pretty soon you will , in spite of yourself , feel downright frumpy because your home is n't decorated that way . Yet in six months the style has come and gone and you ca n't even remember its name .

Such flurries into affected and little-known styles are seldom successful . Almost every style that we find in homes of today was developed during a period of so-called well-being . During these times there was a general prosperity and a relatively sensible manner of life . The general taste for Georgian forms and their American counterparts has this obvious basis . There are , of course , many styles that are suitable for adaptation that we seldom see reproduced . They are usually either too flamboyant in character or too overpowering in scale for modern rooms . Sometimes they are such that they look well only in certain sections of the country . We often find Spanish and Italian Renaissance furniture used in California and Florida , but this same furniture looks totally out of place in more northern  | places . For this reason the styles that will be briefly described here are only these that have a general application to homes all over this country .

They are put here to help you make your home a better and more interesting place to live in . French furniture has never been quite so popular in present-day decoration as English and Early American . There is perhaps a sound reason for this in that each of the important French styles was developed primarily to aggrandize and express the tastes of a special group , the king and the nobility . Obviously this background has little in common with our time . However , there are many fine adaptations of court furniture that have been scaled down to fit the room proportions of our homes . The type of French decoration that appeals to us began during the reign of Louis XIV . A proud , wilful man , well supplied with money by his minister , Colbert , he planned to make his court the most magnificent in Europe . Under the direction of Lebrun , a painter , and Jules Mansart , the architect of roof fame , artists from all over France and , for that matter , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looms of Gobelin and Beauvais , potteries and other art industries all received royal support . While a remarkable number of beautiful buildings were constructed , the palace at Versailles remains the brightest jewel of the collection .  | Furniture design played second fiddle to magnificence of architectural background . Enormous mirrors , oak paneling and painted decoration enriched the walls . Floors were elaborately parqueted . Cornices , pilasters and trim were heavy and classic in feeling . Andre-Charles Boulle was appointed master cabinetmaker to the king . He and his workmen were housed in the Louvre and instructed to produce original and beautiful furniture . This they did , but it seems overly Chair legs and arms of the Louis XIV period . The first is a Flemish scroll , an early forerunner of the Cabriole leg . The second is a carved straight leg . The open arms of the chairs of the period were invariably elaborately curved and carved . rich to us .

Gilded bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accessories and fabrics were equally rich and heavy . Almost all of the furniture was massive and rectangular in form . The entire fashion was a perfect reflection of the character of Le Roi Soleil , the king who said , " The state , it is I. " In 1715 a Regency was established in France . It marks  | a change not only in the manner of court life but in the tastes as well . Entertainment became more informal and with this rooms became smaller and more intimate . Architecture no longer followed the established orders . Arrogant angularity gave way to witty extravagant curves . This was the rococo in full flower . Architectural backgrounds still received the major attention . Walls were paneled , papered , covered with Here we find the transition from the vigorous design of Louis XIV to the curvilinear forms of Louis XV illustrated with chair legs and arms . The Cabriole leg reached a high state of development during this time . Animal feet were constantly used and later the scroll was developed . Arms were usually upholstered. fabric or painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were handsome affairs of marble , and floors were covered with Aubusson and Savonorie carpets . Textiles were extremely luxurious . Brocades , damasks , taffetas , moires and other silks were constantly used . About this time a special type of single-colored printing called Toiles-de-Jouy was first introduced . Furniture followed the pattern established by the architecture . Straight lines were studiously avoided . Al- though the general contour of the pieces remained perfectly symmetrical , the lines and surface adornment were spontaneously rhythmic and often even restless . The essential difference between English and French decoration of the 18th century is that the English is masculine while the French is decidedly feminine . The term handsome applies to the English styles . The French styles may be called beautiful and , in the case of less important pieces , pretty . There was considerable reason for this . In England men set the styles ; in France styles were set by women . The most important influence during the time of Louis XV was his brilliant mistress , Madame Pompadour . A woman of extraordinary imagination and taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , later , classic simplicity . The freedom , intimacy and sophistication of court life led to the development of many new types of furniture . Boudoir furniture received special attention . The chaise longue , the bergere , the small writing desk and cabinet , and the tambour desk were all introduced . Many new types of beds were also developed including those for alcoves . The cabriole leg was constantly employed as were the serpentine and bombe or swelled front . Small tables of all kinds were in constant demand . Oak , mahogany and fruit woods were inlaid with semiprecious woods , such as tulip and kingwood . A great deal of the furniture was painted in sky blue , rose , apricot , grey , cream and similar delicate pastel shades . Rich silk fabrics of delicate design and color upholstered chairs , draped windows and sometimes even walls . Small accessories of all kinds were collected with almost maniacal fervor.  | French archeological research in Herculaneum and Pompeii exercised a chastening influence on taste late in the reign of Louis XV . This classical impulse continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowing rococo forms . When Louis XVI came to the throne the court was bored and nearly bankrupt . Natural gaiety had given way to superficial intellectuality . Dead languages and dead arts were the rage . Yet the style that was evolved from this basis marks the high point of sophisticated perfection in taste . Curves went into limbo . The Greco-Roman motifs , common to the period of Louis XV , returned to light but with added refinement and elegance . Again we find a woman influencing style in decoration , and a woman of exceptional taste . Marie-Antoinette , rebelling always against the realities of court life , affected a shepherdess role which in a more intellectual person would have seemed sheer cynicism . With Louis XVI at heart a mechanic and the queen both childlike and extravagant , court life became increasingly informal . Small rooms were exquisitely paneled in the classical manner . The field was seldom carved and the moldings were simple . Sometimes the paneling was painted and occasionally ornamented in the style of Pompeiian murals or with charming garlands of flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually in empaneled form . Furniture was straight-lined . Joints were no longer concealed as they had been in the time of Louis XV but were accented by carved rosettes and similar ornaments . The invention of various types of woodworking ma- chines such as lathes led to the use of considerable turned forms . Chair and tables legs were usually rounded , tapered and fluted , or reeded . Mahogany became more fashionable and as a result carved ornament replaced marquetry to a certain extent . Ornament usually took the form of banding . Ancient Greece and Rome supplied such motifs as the rosette , egg and dart , and guillochage banding . Floral carv- We find a return to straighter lines during the time of Louis XVI .

Taffetas , brocades , velvets , chintzes and toiles-de-Jouy of gay design and soft colors were used  | for upholstering and draperies . All manner of amusing accessories were collected . The Directoire style is really a continuation of that of Louis XVI . The period itself lasted for only five years . They were years of turmoil and social and economic unrest . New motifs , essentially military in character such Greco-Roman forms were closely followed during both the Directoire and Empire periods .

It was David who discovered the architects Percier and Fontaine . Extraordinarily facile designers who had been influenced by classicism , they soon dominated the  | tastes of France and indirectly the rest of Europe and the young American republic . Although the style is excessively self-conscious , it was a perfect reflection of Napoleon and his court of warriors . Roman militarism dominated design . Rich elaborate draperies at windows and on walls recalled the war tents of a Caesar . The old Roman fasces and a number of Grecian and Pompeiian motifs , such as torches , cornucopias , spears , eagles and classical allegorical subjects , appeared in paint , carving and ormolu . Colors were strong and a constant reminder of the change in regime . Strong , deep reds , purple , brilliant green , yellow and blue replaced the pastels of ten years and many heads before .

Furniture design was sheer archeology . Sphinxes and caryatids supported tables , chairs were replicas of Grecian originals , tripod tables recalled drums , and ormolu was used on everything .

Provincial furniture bears the same relationship to court furniture that American colonial furniture bears to that of the great Georgian English cabinet-makers . In France the influence of the court was relatively restricted to the immediate vicinity of Paris . Meanwhile throughout the rest of the country beautiful furniture was being made , furniture which in most cases appeals  | to us more than the elegant court styles . It is almost always inspired by the styles of Louis XI V , XV and XVI , but tempered and simplified to take its place in the French home . Obviously , the court furniture is finer both in design and quality but it arouses only our admiration . Provincial furniture , on the other hand , brings out the possessive urge in us . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the peasant . The other was for The sweeping extravagant curves of the aprons of chests and so on distinguish the Provincial style . The legs of pieces were either turned or of the Cabriole type . Rush seated chairs were frequently ladder backs with turned posts supporting the arms . In fact the latter are similar to Colonial pieces . wealthy farmers , merchants and the lesser nobility , proud of their lineage and loving their land . The first was made by the peasants . Local craftsmen sometimes simplifying court models are responsible for the second type . Simplicity and utilitarianism are the outstanding characteristics of this furniture no matter what the stylistic influences might be . The two most typical pieces were the armoires , huge chests that served in place of closets , and enclosed beds . The latter were usually placed in  | niches and were curtained . There are also known cases of these beds actually having doors . Chairs were interesting in form and were usually of wood with a rush seat . The backs frequently were of the ladderback type . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabriole occurs in furniture for the wealthier provincials . Each section of France produced a slightly different type of ornament and general design but on the whole it was a remarkably homogeneous style . This is partly due to the constant use of woods , such as walnut , oak , nut and fruit woods , which are indigenous to the entire country . Sometimes oak was stained black to resemble ebony . Rooms at the time were characteristically simple , although the wealthier merchants and the nobility had simply paneled wood and wall-paper backgrounds . Fabrics in wealthier homes were of rich silk materials . Toiles-de-Jouy , checked ginghams and hand-painted linens were also frequently used . Accessories were very like those of our own colonial times in copper , wrought iron , pewter and pottery . The Jacobean period marks the end of medievalism in English design . Beginning with the reign of James I in 16o3 , it lasted until the Restoration of Charles II in 163o . England was then entering a period of prosperity , thanks to her naval supremacy . Her merchant ships traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese pottery and porcelains , Turkey carpets and hand-painted East India cottons . While these were  | available only to the nobility and the wealthy , they inevitably exerted an influence on design generally . Greater prosperity naturally affected manners . Gradually the boisterous customs of Tudor and Elizabethan The Jacobean style was a fusing of foreign influences on Tudor furniture . Chairs were often upholstered in leather . The legs of chairs and tables were frequently turned in a ball or rope form . The melon bulb was also used but in a more delicate form than it had been . Bun feet were also common . times gave way to a more decorous life . This had an influence on furniture which , however , still continued to be made of oak . Bulbous Elizabethan supports were replaced by lighter straight , spiral and twisted rope forms . Chairs were improved by means of upholstered seats and backs and the trestle table was replaced by refectory , drop-leaf and gate-leg tables . Accessories were rela- tively few and usually consisted of absolutely utilitarian objects , such as lighting fixtures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utensils of silver , pewter and heavy earthenware . Fabrics were almost always of crewel work . Jacobean forms exerted tremendous influence on Colonial American design until well into the i 8th century , although in America other woods were substituted for oak . Jacobean furniture has never been especially popular in modern decoration . This is probably due to its heavy quality and in some cases strange forms . However , most oak reproductions are in this style . It is usually used for dining rooms or living rooms . It requires a proper setting to look its best . Walls should be roughly textured and accessories should be in harmony with the furniture . Between the Jacobean period and that of Queen Anne we find furniture somewhat too exotic and enriched for our tastes . After the fire of London in 1666 there came both the opportunity and desire in England to ape foreign manners . Charles II had introduced French luxury , and the important designers , Inigo Jones , Sir Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons had all been influenced by the Italian Renaissance . Oriental pottery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find during this time the introduction of wall paper , pine paneling , walnut as a cabinet wood and the wing chair . William and Mary followed Charles to the throne . Although William of Orange was from Holland , the French taste continued under the influence of his favorite designer , the Huguenot emigre craftsman , Daniel  | Marot . At this time thin walnut veneers superseded oak as a cabinet wood . This was a French fashion and was greatly admired because it allowed a greater beauty of wood grain . Other innovations were the unusual inverted cup leg , the highboy and a use of flat surface decoration on all types of furniture . Both wood inlay work , called marquetry , and lacquer were used for this . Many of the Huguenot emigres who came to England Restoration and William and Mary chair backs illustrate the influence of the Dutch Baroque style on English design . They were usually of cane with elaborately carved frames . after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes were weavers . Consequently , during the time of William and Mary there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet , brocatelles and other weaves never made before in England . Porcelains continued to be imported from China , but at the same time silver work and other domestic accessories were vastly improved in design and workmanship . The Queen Anne period which began in 1702 is in a sense a misnomer . Actually , it marks the beginning ,  | aesthetically at any rate , of the Georgian style . The Queen had little influence on or interest in the style named for her . However , it was a time of unprecedented prosperity and ushered in a great social change in England . New and large fortunes were being quickly made in shipping and in land speculation in the Colonies and an upper middle class was gradually superseding the Court as the influence on the life and tastes of the country . The legs of furniture during the Restoration and time of William and Mary show many foreign influences . The illustrations from left to right , a Flemish scroll , a Spanish foot , the unusual inverted bell shape and a combination of carved bell leg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , architecture and decoration . This is probably the reason the Queen Anne and subsequent 18th-century English styles appeal to us more than do any others . They were styles created for the homes of people we can understand and admire , people who lived essentially as we do . Walnut soon became the favorite cabinet wood . Although it has a beautiful grain it does not lend itself very  | readily to elaborate carving . As a result , cabinet-makers became interested primarily in form and proportion . Graceful curves supplanted angularity and ornate carving . Chair design was vastly improved at this time . Backs of chairs were shaped to follow the lines of the body and the handsome cabriole leg and ball-and-claw foot , inspired by Chinese precedent , were introduced . The only carved motifs were the acanthus leaf and the scallop shell . These were used sparingly on the backs and legs of chairs . Small tables were also improved in type and design . Coffee , tea and chocolate tables were in wide demand . Spider-leg , drop-leaf , tilt-top , pie-crust and gallery-top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated with scroll or broken pediments . Mirrors were another important item of furniture . They were usually beveled and had a wood frame in a curvilinear form resembling the backs of Queen Anne chairs . Oriental rugs and Chinese porcelains influenced the taste in color and design . Needlework , damask brocatelles , velvet and chintz were all made in subtler combinations of colors and all showed the influence of Oriental pattern . The Elector of Hanover ascended the British throne in 1714 , to be known as George I. His tastes were entirely German and therefore had practically no influence on the time . The only incentive to good furniture making was the ever-growing middle-class clientele and the introduction of mahogany as a cabinet wood . Both were important but the qualities of the new wood brought the greater change . While not quite so rich in grain as walnut , mahogany has a number of advantages in that it is stronger , free  | from worm attack and has a fine texture for crisp carving . Because of its strength , chair legs and other structural parts became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more delicate than it had ever been before . Today the name Chippendale has become a generic term to designate almost all middle-Georgian type design . While this broad use of the word is inaccurate it is also convenient and has some justification . Actually Chippendale did not invent the style which is named for him . Nor do we have many pieces of furniture that we can attribute to him . On the other hand , he published " The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker 's Director " which went through three editions and exerted a tremendous influence on the taste of the time . One of the reasons for its success was that in it he co-ordinated all of the influences that were then affecting design into a homogeneous English style . These influences stemmed from widely different sources . The most important was inherited from the time of Queen Anne . Essentially English in the reticent use of ornament , it is the type of Chippendale furniture we most admire . The second influence is French and flamboyant . It is call rocaille . Elaborate carving almost concealed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well liked during Chippendale 's time , we find it overly ornate and heavy . We seldom see it in reproduction except occasionally simplified on a ribbonback chair . Chinese art was greatly admired and naturally affected furniture design . Chippendale used so  | many Chinese motifs that there is a certain type of furniture designed by him called Chinese Chippendale . Simple fretwork and latticework on the backs , legs and stretchers of chairs , the aprons of table and the tops of bookcases and chests , plus an occasional use of a pagoda form , identify it . The fourth influence was Gothic . This type we seldom see reproduced except in the occasional use of pointed arches on bookcases and china cabinets . Chippendale 's greatest influence was on chair design . He improved the cabriole leg with carved foot and in his later work favored the straight leg . This is especially pleasing when ornamented with Chinese fretwork . His chair backs though sometimes upholstered were more usually carved in ribbon , ladder or lattice design . Chippendale 's other furniture indicates a penchant for elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As to the man himself , we know that he was born about 1718 . He was the son of a joiner named John and probably received his training from his father . He went to London some time before he was thirty . Undoubtedly an excellent business man , he soon had an important clientele . The business continued under his direction until his death in 1779 . It was then carried on by his son , Thomas , who died in 1822 . Since Chippendale 's clients were invariably wealthy , their homes were rather elaborate . Robert and James Adam exerted tremendous influence on the interior architecture during the latter part of the period . It was adapted from classical precedent discovered at Pompeii and Herculaneum . The Adams had made measured details of Diocletian 's Palace at Spalato in Dalmatia and understood Roman classicism thoroughly . They also  | owned the English rights to applied compo ornament and stone intarsia , a method of inlaying patterns in marble with colored cement . All of this combined to eliminate wood paneling in favor of elaborate plaster work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ china reflected either an Oriental or classical influence . Fabrics and floor coverings were also richly designed . Less is known about the life of Hepplewhite than that of any other important English designer . His influence , however , was tremendous . Like Chippendale 's , it is due to a book , his " Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer 's Guide , " posthumously published in 1788 , and his radical changes in chair design . Unquestionably influenced by the Adam brothers , his work is distinguished by its exquisite delicacy and by the use of satinwood , painted ornament and marquetry . The legs of his chairs were invariably straight , either round or more usually square , delicate and tapering . He used five types of backs , the shield , which is best known , the camel , oval , heart and wheel . He also used the threeostrich-feather crest of the Prince of Wales as ornament on chair backs . Tables and other furniture designed by Hepplewhite were equally delicate in design . His sideboards usually were curved in front , convex in the center and terminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name in Georgian English cabinetmaking is Thomas Sheraton . Less successful than Chippen- dale or Hepplewhite , he was probably more inventive than either . Born about 175o , he arrived in London about 1790 and shortly after published his " Cabinet-Maker 's and Upholsterer 's Drawing Book , " which had a great influence . Primarily a designer , he shows in his work an incomparable grace , harmony of proportion and understanding of construction . All of his furniture is delicate in size and was usually designed to be executed in satinwood . He , too , is best known for his chairs . The legs are much like those of Hepplewhite , but the backs are rectangular . His sideboards are just the reverse of Hepplewhite 's in that they are concave in the center and convex at the ends . Both Hepplewhite and Sheraton furniture look best in an Adam background . Both executed furniture designed by the Adams and both were greatly influenced by the classic revival . Color schemes , which also became more delicate , were inspired by both Oriental and domestic china which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pictures , clocks , mirrors and statues , also became more fashionable . Toward the close of the 18th century the classical influence was being widely used as the principal source of inspiration . By the 19th century , however , it was no longer serving as an inspiration but classical forms were actually being copied . Obviously the degeneration of the creative spirit was rapid . Furniture designing became a sort of archeological field day . Ancient Greece , Egypt and Rome all served as grist to the mill . Many of the pieces were amusing and sophisticated , but on the  | whole they were so self-conscious that they are scarcely ever reproduced today . There were of course many fine things made at the time . Among the more important designers of the period were Thomas Hope and Sir John Soane . Color schemes changed from the pastel shades of Adam to the heavy , dark reds and browns of Pompeii . Draperies were more elaborate and the accessories were all of classical inspiration . When the English Puritans first came to Massachusetts they brought little in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as traveling boxes . Their tastes , however , had been formed in the mother country and the few craftsmen who came here had been trained in England . The earliest furniture was simple and essential . Jacobean and Elizabethan forms were used both in the design of it and the architecture . The earliest shelters in Massachusetts were probably tents , caves dug in the hillside , and wigwams patterned after those of the Indians . Later simple frame houses consisting of one room , an entryway and fireplace , were built in the medieval manner . As families grew these were enlarged . Some of the early roofs were thatched but these in the dry New England climate were soon recognized as fire hazards and shingles were used instead . The interiors were very simple . A large fireplace was the dominating feature . This was used for both warmth and cooking . Structural wood beams added a sense of lowness to ceilings that were already love . Sometimes the walls were plastered but more frequently they were  | covered with random-width pine siding . The earliest floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furnishing consisted of absolute essentials . Household equipment of all kinds was made of pewter , iron and wood . Most of the furniture was equally useful and simple . Chests of endless variety were most popular . Settles , beds , tables with turned legs and sometimes with dropleaves , benches and chairs were also made . The early chairs were built on straight lines . The wainscot chair , the slat-back and the Carver , named for an early governor , were all popular . The latter type , probably the first original American furniture , had straight turned legs which extended up to form the back supports between which were vertical and horizontal spindles . Seats were either of wood or rush . Ornament consisted of simple incised variations of the rose , tulip and sunflower . The woods most frequently employed were pine , beech , maple , ash , cherry , cedar , walnut and oak . Even in the south where brick had been used as early as the 17th century neither the interiors nor their furnishings were much different . There was marked change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to America to introduce the William and Mary and Queen Anne forms . Homes were larger and more elaborately furnished . Both solid and veneer walnut was used but in a far simpler manner than it had been in England . It is also probable that mahogany was used in America before it was in England . About this time Oriental rugs were introduced as were various English upholstery and drapery fabrics .  | During the first quarter of the 18th century the Georgian influence was first felt . Portsmouth , Newport , Annapolis , the Virginia Tidewater country , New Bern and Charleston all were centers of aristocratic colonial life . This comprised both prosperous merchant and planter classes . They depended on England for their cultural inspiration and they imported architectural books , architects and furnishings . In general , however , the American forms were greatly simplified . In certain sections of the country , notably in the Connecticut Valley , Jacobean motifs were applied to Georgian paneling . Most of the better furniture was based on Chippendale design and was made of mahogany . A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best were Thomas Affleck , Benjamin Randolph , William Savery and Thomas Tufft in Philadelphia , and John Goddard and John Townsend in Newport . Boston was best known for clockmakers and silversmiths such as Simon Willard and Paul Revere , who was not only a patriot but an engraver , silversmith and designer of false teeth . Accessories for the wealthy were mostly brought from England . Local craftsmen in metal , wood , pottery and glass supplied most workaday objects . Some of these were extremely beautiful and are today rare and valuable . Among the best is glass made by Henry William Stiegel in Mannheim , Pennsylvania . A great deal of the country-made furniture during the 18th century is exceptionally beautiful . While oftentimes the proportions are crude they were always made with great spirit . Windsor chairs , which had been first developed in England during the early portion of the 18th century were popular . The American versions were  | improvements of the English original . The backs were the most important and distinctive feature and consisted of hoop , fan , brace , comb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . The Windsor design was used for settees , arm-chairs , side chairs and rockers . Sometimes they were painted and decorated with stenciled patterns . Other influences in 18th Century design were those of the Dutch in New York , both on Long Island and in the Hudson River Valley , and those of German and Swiss immigrants in eastern Pennsylvania . In both cases native woods such as pine and cherry were used . The most important contributions of the Dutch settlers was the introduction of the double door on cabinets , the kas or chest which resembles the Provincial armoire and Delft ware . The Germans in Pennsylvania made replicas of peasant furniture of southern Germany and Switzerland . Some of these pieces were amusingly painted but in general this furniture had little influence anywhere else in America . They also made fine slipware pottery and resist fabrics which have become valuable collectors ' items . The Federal period takes on a definite identity about i800 . Previous to this time , the Georgian English influence was still at work . From the beginning the best work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McIntyre , the great carver-architect of Salem , designer and builder of the Peirce-Nichols house , John McComb , winner of the competition for a new city hall in New York , Thomas Jefferson , designer of Monticello ,  | Charles Bulfinch , architect of the State House in Boston , James Hoban , architect of the White House , and Benjamin Latrobe , the first American architect in the accepted sense , all led the way . Although they felt the inspiration of Greece , Rome , and Palladio , the greatest of Italian architects , they gave the classic forms a new , fresh and , somehow , American meaning . Their work has a dignity and refinement that seems lacking in the affected ornateness of the contemporary Empire and Regency tastes . The European influence was not , however , lacking although English design was temporarily slighted for finer Empire fabrics , furniture and accessories from France . Most of the native cabinetmakers found Adam , Sheraton and Hepplewhite designs more to their taste but , typically , these were considerably modified . A good many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually in mahogany , satinwood , maple and fruit woods . Pieces became incomparably delicate in proportion , finely carved , and veneering and inlay reached a new high . An interesting type of furniture at this time was the " fancy " or Hitchcock chair . Named for Lambert Hitchcock of Connecticut , this type of chair may have been invented by him but there is considerable question about this . Many other Connecticut chair makers produced similar furniture , but Hitchcock stenciled his name on the back edge of the seats and his work is undoubtedly the best . An adaptation of later Sheraton design , these chairs are usually painted black , green or yellow and have applied design in paint , stencil or decalcomania . They were made of birch or maple with cane or rush  | seat , partly by hand and partly by machine , and sold to farmers and small home owners . Hitchcock is also probably responsible for the so-called Boston Rocker , the most popular type of rocking chair . Probably the best known of all American furniture makers , Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftsmanship . Influenced by both the designs of Sheraton and the French Empire , he yet managed to create a style of furniture that is remarkably individual . His chairs , sofas and tables are especially fine . He used the lyre back to a great extent on chair backs , cornucopia legs on sofas and the Grecian style flared leg on both tables and chairs . Since he usually worked in fine mahogany , the carving is delicate and beautiful . He used swags , animal feet and military motifs , such as bunches of arrows to a great extent . Phyfe was born in Scotland and after an apprenticeship in Albany he opened a shop in New York about 1790 . He had an almost immediate success . His best work was done up to about 183o when American taste declined with Europe 's . After that time his products were heavy and ugly . He died in 1854 , at the age of eighty-four , a bitter , disappointed man . There are two diametrically opposed viewpoints as to the merit of Victorian furniture . Some hold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the other group feels that it should all be saved for posterity . A middle of the road course might be more sensible .  | Duncan Phyfe 's earlier work was affected by Sher- ? aton and contemporary French tastes . Most of his work in mahogany was beautifully carved and was often enriched with brass ornament . The lyre motif was constantly employed by him . Hitchcock or " fancy " chairs were based on Sheraton originals.  | The Victorian period is interesting largely because of the tremendous influence a shifting social emphasis and the invention of power-driven machinery had on art forms . Vast fortunes were being made in new industries and in speculation not only in this country but in Europe . It was the dawn of a fantastic era , a time of silly pretentiousness . People vied with each other in lavish display . The creative artist was looked upon with more than a little suspicion . The suddenly rich were only willing to accept as good the art forms of a dead aristocracy . The Gothic period , the rococo , romanesque and Moorish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was some work of real merit , although it was usually writhing with ornament . In England Victoria had practically no taste and her consort 's was all bad . America set store by Godey 's Lady 's Book , rosewood and Circassian walnut . So far as furniture making was concerned , it was not only in most cases ugly but , worse yet , badly constructed . On the other hand , chintzes , cast-iron grilles and small glass and pottery ornaments were often exquisitely . designed and made . Many of the mechanical gadgets that were then and now collected as amusing bibelots are so fine that they defy description Today we use Victorian decoration in a free and witty way . If we . try to repeat the dreary earnestness of the period , we have a dowdy result . If , on the other hand , we think of it as amusing and adaptable to a playful treatment , the result is very fashionable . Many people own Victorian furniture and they usually overestimate the value of it . If you have some and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with it . Do n't think of it as something with a potential  | monetary value . Collectors have gobbled up the few rarities of the period . There is an ancient aphorism to the effect that once you give a dog a bad name it always lasts . Whether this is true of modern design remains to be seen . At least its partial acceptance denotes an aesthetic maturity . Obviously every period must have its own art forms . And it seems improbable that America is content with only the streamlined automobile . New manufacturing processes , new synthetic materials and a new manner of life furnish the motivating impulses for the new forms . Each year more and more people are won over to contemporary design . Obviously each year the design changes because creative design can not be a static thing . The whole movement started during the Victorian period . In England William Morris , Ruskin and a number of lesser aesthetes began to agitate against the reproduction and adaptation of earlier furniture and decorative patterns . Morris especially was interested in decorative design and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were good , although limited , but unfortunately he received little popular support . Like most prophets he was neglected in his own country , but exerted a tremendous influence in France and in central Europe , particularly Vienna . Shortly before 1900 the Wiener Werkstatte was formed in Vienna to promote creative decorative design . Included in the membership were architects and original designers such as Joseph Hoffman and an incredible number of able  | craftsmen , most outstanding of whom was Dagobert Peche . The work produced by this group was gay and charming . Most of the design was based on a combination of peasant and baroque forms all brought together in a logical and original manner . The French interpretation of Morris 's teachings was called Art Nouveau . It reached its fullest flower at the Paris exposition in 1900 and was for a short time an influence in America especially in architecture and tableware design . The shortcomings of Art Nouveau is that it was an entirely surface treatment without regard for basic construction . Some of the intertwining naturalistic forms are fantastically surrealist . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afoot to develop a decorative art that would bring glory to the Kaiser . German designers looked to early 19th century forms for their inspiration . About 1911 it had become a well-integrated style and was making definite headway until the war intervened . Chemical research during the war led to many discoveries that soon influenced decoration . Lacquer , cellophane and rayon are all variations of nitrated cotton which is used for munitions . Many factories that had been used for the making of armaments had to be quickly converted to peacetime production . Europe was poor and there was an acute shortage of adequate housing in German and other central European cities . The architect and the designer had to work in a strictly utilitarian way . Instead of thinking in terms of ornament they concentrated on form . This was an entirely revolutionary procedure . A complete art philosophy was created to rationalize a style that was fostered by sheer necessity . It  | claimed that if anything was utilitarian it was automatically beautiful . France in the meantime was developing a style partly based on pre-war German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town with it . Restless , chic and often in bad taste , it became the fairy godmother of our own short-lived modernistic style . Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries had for years been quietly producing furniture , fabrics , accessories and architecture that were entirely in the contemporary taste . Based on Chinese , classical and native peasant design , it is nationalistic , logical , restrained and beautiful . Both England and Italy were the last countries to appreciate the new vernacular . But strangely enough , they are today producing the most dramatic work . The style in Italy has received government sanction . It is nationalistic , vigorous and in some cases may be considered propagandistic art . England has advanced further in architecture than it has in furniture design . However , there is a talented group of younger men working there whose influence will be greatly felt . If England embraces modern design , it seems inevitable , if we look at the record , that America must adopt it , too . Our own position in the matter is strangely anachronistic . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Lloyd Wright , were , and so far as Wright is concerned , still are , in advance of their time . Inventive and logical , they sought to release our architecture from its sugary coating of wedding-cake ornament and obsolete traditions . They cried out pretty much in a wilderness . Fortunately , they pointed the way  | for more perceptive Europeans , and their teachings have come back to us filtered by foreign taste . All this is illogical but true . ' We pretend to be people of sound common sense , yet we seem to be incorrigible escapists . The early New England farmer lived in an absolutely utilitarian house furnished with utilitarian objects . Unfortunately we admire it not because it was functional , but as a form of ancestor worship . Presidents of automobile companies promote streamlined cars and then retire to Tudor palaces . Radios are forced into Chinese Chippendale cabinets and the surface of metal furniture is treated to imitate the graining of wood . We accept good design as a matter of course . We save our kudos for transient smartness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools and an enthusiastic group of younger designers began exerting their influence . Just what form American modernism will take it is difficult to foretell . At least most of the younger men are working in an American medium instead of basing their design on European precedent as so many of our modern designers did a few years ago . It is almost impossible to lay down rules for anything that is in a state of constant change , and after all contemporary design means constant change . Yet there are certain very definite characteristics of modern design that are so meritorious that it seems safe to predict their continued use . The most important development , the free and flexible house plan , is possible only because of new methods of construction and new building materials . The modern house is planned to suit the living habits of the individual family . Windows are no longer related to the exterior  | design of the house but are placed in logical relationship to the rooms . Because of this , interior wall areas are no longer spoiled by windows and doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods have also changed the nature of interior partitions . A few years ago the walls between rooms served as bearing partitions necessary to the actual construction of the house . This meant that these walls must be comparatively thick . With the new construction , partitions are light and flexible . Sometimes they are merely curtains on tracks , glass screens , folding doors or even built-in furniture such as wardrobes or bookcases . Their main purpose is to divide the various activities that take place in home life without making the house seem a series of box-like cubicles . The new materials have conditioned our very taste . Glass , in both plate and brick form , various wall boards and acoustical materials need no applied finish . Consequently there is a greater appreciation of the inherent textural characteristics of structural materials . Lighting and , to a certain extent , furniture , have become an integral part of the architecture . Cabinets , bookcases , wardrobes , sofas and sometimes beds are actual built-in furniture . Frequently it is difficult to determine just where architecture ends and furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . Instead , contemporary designers confine themselves to form , line and texture . The new materials are used in a frank manner . Bentwood , metal and plastic furniture are efficient and as a rule inexpensive . There are no formal rules for the modern designer to follow . Practicality , imagination and a sound knowledge of construction and the inherent characteristics of ma- terials are his only limitations . Each year new materials and processes are available . And each year they affect design . Every decorative period has had its identifying motif . Thus far the modern designer , except in Italy where the fasces is used , has not yet succeeded in finding one . Certainly streamlining and the setback design of modern skyscrapers are inadequate . The motif must evolve naturally from the inner spirit of a people and their time . Until such a motif is found , unaffected simplicity will remain the best standard of appreciation of contemporary art in industry . Neither French Provincial nor Country Colonial furniture comes under this category . When we think of peasant styles we mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scandinavian countries and Mexico . Invariably it is painted in brilliant greens , yellows , reds , blues and black and decorated with figures , animals and floral designs . The forms of the furniture are usually simple . Legs are either straight or turned and variations of the ladder-back chair have wood or rush seats . Although there is some difference in design between the various types , they are all unified by a childlike simplicity of drawing and a use of brilliant color . Accessories are equally crude handwoven materials of great charm . Glass and pottery are equally whimsical and rugged . The peasant styles are only suitable for week-end and other similar country houses . They are also very pleasant for a younger child 's room .  | Eclecticism is a term we frequently hear in discussion of the decorative arts . Since it means adapting the various art forms of the past to contemporary conditions , it is perfectly obvious that no style can possible develop spontaneously . Every style is based on a previous one . This is even true of modern design where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive times . We use the Orient , Greece , Egypt , African native art and anything else that is adaptable to our needs . Thanks to eclecticism , it is possible to combine various period styles and achieve a fine decorative effect . This is frequently done by the best decorators and is a way of achieving real character in a room . There are three sound rules for doing this . The simplest is to combine furniture from different countries that was made at approximately the same time . Thus Louis XV , Sheraton , Hepplewhite and Federal furniture could all be used together . So too could Empire , Regency and Duncan Phyfe . The second method is to combine a style with its inspirational source . In doing this you would combine Chinese Chippendale with Chinese furniture or Directoire with reproductions of Greek furniture . The third method requires greatepractice . It is the combination of styles that have an affinity because of sheer design . Thus Greek art can be combined with one kind of modern and Colonial design with another . To do this well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FURNITURE buying can be made either a pleasant adventure or a deadly chore . It all depends on whether you go about selecting your furniture armed with patience and knowledge or whether you 'd rather take the easier course of letting a glib salesman sell you something that is n't as good as it should be . The latter course gives you extra time for bridge or trying on a new hat , but it does n't do much for your home . Although furniture is usually bought to last a lifetime , few laymen know very much about selecting it . They usually go into a store , look at a few pieces , decide on one after a cursory examination , and leave the store with a warm feeling of possession . Sometimes , after the piece has shed its wrappings in the home , this feeling has grown pretty cold . Actually there is no great trick to buying furniture in an intelligent manner . Granted that it takes a little more time to do , the results are worth the extra effort . Always remember that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little less . Hence knowledge is really an economy . There are two types of furniture : case goods , which means all sorts of all-wood pieces , and upholstered fur . niture . The first is easier to buy intelligently because almost everything to know about it is close to the surface ,  | On the other hand , a handsome upholstering material can cover a multitude of furniture sins . Therefore , sofas and upholstered chairs should be bought only from reputable dealers . Most people have definite ideas about the style and arrangement of furniture ; many are acquainted with the characteristics of furniture design ; but very few buyers have even a rudimentary knowledge of furniture construction , the most important point of all , on which the comfort , endurance and eventually the appearance of furniture depend . Construction has always varied greatly between good and bad , and the period of the greatest variation is the present . Because upholstered furniture made today is attractively covered , it is difficult to tell by a brief examination whether or not it is durably built . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics will help you to get your money 's worth when you buy . Just because a piece of furniture is expensive , it is not necessarily better in design than a cheaper piece . The probability is that it is better in construction and that it has a great deal more hand carving , something which in itself can be an evil , too . Manufacturers of mediumprice furniture seem to be producing better merchandise each year . Furniture can be roughly divided into three grades . The best and most expensive is called standard grade . 1 t is the best in construction and should be the best in design . The finest materials are used in its making , not  | only on the surface but in all the concealed parts as well . Medium-grade furniture takes in an infinitely wider scope . There is less hand craftsmanship but often the pieces are extremely well constructed . Naturally the materials used in its construction are not as fine as those used for standard-grade furniture , yet the difference is sometimes merely a matter of a less choice piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand finish . Low-grade furniture is sometimes called " borax " furniture . It is almost invariably poorly designed and badly constructed . Usually a good deal of applied ornament and inferior carving is used to cover faulty workmanship . The pieces as a rule are badly finished and are joined with nails or bolts . Fortunately few responsible dealers handle this type of merchandise . Furniture sizes have been conditioned by two things : human anatomy and the number and size of the average personal possessions . This has been an evolutionary process and therefore a great many reproductions of antique furniture have been scaled down to meet the requirements of today . This scientific approach to furniture design has to a certain extent affected domestic architecture in regulating room sizes . Most furniture other than that for living rooms is sold in suites . This method is not only a boon so far as selecting furniture for stylistic harmony is concerned but it also assures you an adequate number of pieces for your needs . The following list indicates the sizes in which most standard pieces of furniture are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layman to learn to recognize a fine finish and that is by experience . Examine antique furniture in museums and in the establishments of fine decorators . Antiques were finished in the best way , carefully and slowly . Carry a mental picture of this finish with you when you shop for your furniture and you should then get the best . Finishing is an art . In the best grades of furniture the piece is carefully sandpapered and then rubbed down with successive coats of oil and pumice . This is a slow and costly process and almost every manufacturer has a slightly different technique for doing it . Medium-grade furniture is frequently stained and then shellacked , varnished or lacquered . Since this is done with an airbrush , it is obviously a faster way of working . Borax furniture is always stained , usually in imitation of a more costly wood than is used in the piece , and then finished with a highly glossy surface . After you have satisfied yourself that the piece is well finished , look at it for structural details . Examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dresser or a table are attached to the sides of the drawers . Dovetail joints , made by the interlocking of wedgeshaped projections , afford the strongest construction . On cheap furniture the backs and frequently the fronts are nailed to the sides . The drawers should fit well and slide easily . There are no laws requiring the accurate labeling of the grades of furniture . You will therefore have to investigate for yourself in order to find out whether you are getting the quality you have decided to buy . Besides sitting in chairs and rocking tables to learn whether they sit evenly on the floor , there are a number of tests you  | can apply to discover what furnishings are made of and how they have been built . Finish : The care with which surfacing has been done is the criterion for furniture finish . Is the carving sharp and distinct ? Is the surface as smooth beneath the varnish as it appears to be from the outside ? Surfaces should be of natural color , and their finish should be of eggshell smoothness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints have been carefully fitted together . Drawers should have sides attached to the front by means of a series of interlocking wedges that resemble the fantail of a dove and are consequently called dovetail joints . Other joining should be done by means of wood dowels or mortise and tenon . The inferior grades of furniture are joined with glue or nails . The only use of glue and screws found in fine furniture is the standard practice of placing corner blocks in chairs . Woods : Inferior types of wood are sometimes stained to look like mahogany or walnut . If there are no visible pores in the wood , it has been stained . Red gum and birch are sometimes given veneers to make them look like solid walnut or mahogany . Look at the edges to see if the wood is really solid . Solid mahogany and walnut are , of course , more expensive than veneered furniture , but do n't let that frighten you away from veneer . Veneer is sometimes stronger than solid furniture , and it is less apt to warp . Veneered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stronger but less decorative woods are usually used for inner construction , while the decorative varieties with beautiful grains are used on the surface . Many woods entirely unsuitable for solid construction are used as veneers because of their beautiful grain .  | One of the fundamental reasons for the superiority of Georgian furniture making can be traced to the logical use of both veneers and solid woods . Acacia is a light brown wood occasionally used for furniture . It carves fairly well . Amaranth is an exotic , fine-grained dark purple wood occasionally used as a veneer for furniture . Amboyna is a richly grained deep brown wood with yellow and red streaks . It was used in 19th Century French and modern cabinet-making both in solid and veneer form . Apple is one of the most popular fruit woods . It is light in color and of fine grain . Many of the so-called oyster veneers in 17th Century English work were of this . Ash is a nicely grained blonde wood occasionally used for veneering modern furniture . Avodire is a very pale wood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veneer on modern furniture . Beech is a pale wood resembling maple and birch and is used in much the same way . Birch is a straight-grained wood that ranges from a blonde to a light-brown color . It is used both in solid form and as a veneer . When used as a veneer it often has an intricate and swirling grain . Black Walnut is an extremely beautifully grained wood that can be used as a veneer and as a solid wood . It also lends itself to fine carving . It was widely used in the 19th Century . Boxwood is a very finely grained pale wood used only for inlaying . Cherry is another fruit wood and is relatively scarce . It has a fairly close grain and is reddish-brown in color . Chestnut has a slightly coarser grain than oak , which it resembles . It is seldom used in furniture making except as a core for fine veneering.  | Circassian Walnut is an expensive and handsome brown wood that is used only for the finest furniture . Cocabolo is an exotic violet-brown wood occasionally used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for furniture despite its softness . One of the most interesting ways of finishing it is the so-called sugi treatment of bringing out the grain in high relief to resemble driftwood . This is done by burning the surface of the wood with a blowtorch and then finishing with a wire brush . Ebony comes in two forms . Black ebony is most often used for accenting furniture . Macassar ebony is a boldly figured wood , striped in black and yellow-brown , and is frequently used as a veneer on modern furniture . Elm is a readily workable hardwood that takes a fine finish . ' While it does not have an interesting grain , it is frequently used for furniture . Eucalyptus , sometimes inaccurately called Oriental walnut , is used as a veneer on inexpensive modern furniture . It is a pale red-yellow in color . Gum is one of the most common of inexpensive furniture woods since it can be finished to imitate walnut , mahogany or maple . Finished in a natural manner , it makes a very satisfactory cabinet wood for modern design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver-grey . It is a very popular veneer wood for modern furniture . Holly is a light-colored , closely grained wood used only for inlaying . Kingwood is another exotic wood used in modern cabinetmaking . It is dark brown with black and yellow streaks . Laurel is a wavy-grained wood of a dark red-brown color that lends itself to modern veneering . Mahogany is probably the most satisfactory of all woods . It can be used as a structural wood as well as a veneer . It lends itself to crisp carving and fine finishing . It is  | available in many different types of graining as a veneer . It is a deep , soft red-brown in color and has a fine , even grain . Maple has always been popular as an American cabinet wood . While it is most frequently used in solid form , it makes a fine veneer . As a rule , curly and bird's-eye maple are used for the latter purpose . The natural color of the wood is a light , slightly reddish-brown , but can be subjected to a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another popular veneering wood for modern furniture . It is blonde in color and has a rich grain . Oak lends itself to more different cutting techniques than any other wood . It has an interesting , vigorous grain . It is a popular cabinet wood , in both solid and veneer forms . The natural wood is very light in color , shading to a soft beige-brown , but when finished the colors may range from a light brown to a deep brown . Olive is a light green-yellow wood used for inlaying . Palisander is another semi-precious wood admired by modern designers . It is violet-brown in color . Pearwood is the most popular of all the fruit woods . It is pink-brown in color and takes a splendid finish . Pine comes in two forms . The so-called white pine is considered a soft wood . It was often used as a cabinet wood during the Colonial period and is today used for reproductions . It does not have a very pronounced grain . Yellow pine is a hardwood and seldom used for good furniture making . Primavera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure and its blonde color recommends its use in modern design . Redwood is only occasionally used in furniture making because of its tendency to split at the edge . Rosewood has long been a popular cabinet wood because of its handsome red-brown surface marked with black . It takes a beautiful finish .  | Satinwood is only used for the most expensive furniture . It is a pale wood of fine figure and it takes a splendid finish . Snakewood has pronounced dark spots on a yellow or redbrown surface . It is most frequently used for inlays . Sycamore is a handsome light-colored wood that is frequently used for veneering . Teakwood ranges from yellow to brown in color with black streakings . It is used most frequently as a solid wood . Thuya is most often used in burl veneers . It is dark red-brown in color . Tulipwood is and was used for banding on rather elaborate furniture . It is readily distinguishable because of its pink-red streaks on a yellow wood . Walnut is next to mahogany in popularity as a cabinet wood . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid and veneer form . The latter is the more popular because of the wood 's beautiful grain . Yew ' is a closely grained wood of a red-brown color that is frequently used in fine cabinet work . Zebrawood is another exotic wood used for modern veneering . Its pronounced stripes of dark brown on light yellow resemble the animal for which it is named . The color and design of upholstery is of course chosen to conform to the decorative scheme of the room in which it is to be used . When patterned fabrics are chosen , be sure to choose a design in scale with the size of the chair , so that it will repeat a number of times and give an even effect . Remember , too , that the relation of fabric color to the color scheme of the room depends to a great extent on the texture of the fabric , which sometimes alters color values under different lights . In selecting upholstery fabrics for durability , you should take into consideration the amount of wear each  | upholstered piece will receive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool frieze , faille , armure and moire . Luxurious ( and expensive ) upholstery fabrics are the brocades , satin , broche , rep , needlepoint , taffeta and silk damask . Although these fabrics are durable , their elaborate weaves sometimes shorten the life of their wear because the design becomes rubbed and looks fuzzy . Velours and velvet have a tendency to become crushed . Many materials which seem inexpensive turn out not to be so because they stand use such a short time . Broadcloth , corduroy , linen , moquetee , plush , cretonne , chintz and homespun wear moderately well and are in the medium-price range . Most of the things that determine whether or not a piece of upholstered furniture is worth buying are concealed from sight . However , handling the chair or the sofa in a vigorous fashion should give a clue to its merits . Be certain that the seat of an upholstered chair is firmly supported . In well-constructed chairs the springs and stuffing are supported by strips of webbing laced across the back , seat and arms . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side . If there is a question in your mind about the construction , have the salesman remove the muslin from the underside . You can then examine the webbing without damage to the piece . Wooden slats are adequate supports for chair seats , but they require large springs to give the proper resiliency . Sagless and similar patented constructions sometimes used in less expensive furniture have never proved as satisfactory as careful hand workmanship . The requirements for wood , finish and joining in upholstered pieces are the same as those for all-wood furniture . Push the back and arms to find out about this . The  | design of upholstered furniture has improved in recent years . Design of the wooden portion of chairs now tends toward simplicity , and the strenuous effort to reproduce elaborate period details has fortunately been abandoned . For several hundred years there have been collectors of antiques . But it was not until the twentieth century that antiques were collected simply because they were antiques . Before that it was required that they also be works of art . This kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the very wealthy . Several years ago more ordinary folk began to collect early American farm furniture , French Provincial and English and American mahogany furniture because they discovered that it was actually cheaper than buying new reproductions . Gradually , as the demand for this type of furniture increased , the price of these rather crude pieces increased , too . So today we have not only the faker of fine antiques , but the faker of crude pieces . Old woods are used in their making and the old method of construction is closely followed . There is only one way of knowing antiques and that is by hard study and observation . There are many excellent books on the subject . Keep away from the too obvious bargain . Everybody knows that there is a market for old furniture and every seller has an inflated sense of its value . Never buy an antique without examining its minutest details . Look at the drawer construction . If the dovetail joints are close together , they were made by machine , if far apart , they were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joints together . Nails and screws were never used . If you are a novice , the best guarantee for an antique should be a letter from the dealer who sells it to you . And bear this in mind , too . It 's no fun having an antique that keeps falling apart . Examine the piece for strength . A table may rock a little because the glue around the dowels has dried . This can be easily repaired . But do n't buy pieces with broken or too obviously repaired parts . A good reproduction would be a lot less costly in the long run . The first metal furniture was designed to imitate wood , with horrible effects on the decorative scheme . Modern decoration soon began to use metal to create chairs intended primarily for comfort . These chairs and other metal furnishings were first introduced into offices and hospitals , eventually finding their way into dwelling decoration as the functional tendency of the modern grew . Today they are increasingly used in modern interiors as an important , often a necessary , part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derives from the appearance of the metal itself and the simplicity of line to which it adapts itself so well . Metal furniture is well-nigh indestructible and is very easy to take care of . Most of it is made of spring steel , which will withstand all stresses and strains . The steel is covered by lacquer or chromium , which is rustproof and remains bright without polishing .  | The place of furniture in the decorative scheme can be effectively emphasized by the use of paint . If , for example , the furniture is too large for the room , you can paint it the same color as the walls , thus reducing its conspicuousness . If a single piece of furniture seems in danger of getting lost because it is small , it can be painted a striking color to attract the eye and hence gains importance in the room . Painted furnishings also accent the decorative style of a room . Lacquered furniture , especially cabinets , is appropriate for formal rooms , suggesting as it does the luxurious French Court and Early Georgian styles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gay , informal rooms , particularly of the rustic type . Adam chairs painted black , of which there are many in this country , suggest the Federal American period in which this style originated . Modern painted furniture is usually used in very simple rooms designed for a definite function , like the kitchen , the play room or nursery . Such furnishings arc usually in a solid color , and may be particularly useful in brightening rooms with white or grey walls . Modern decorators have introduced a great many new materials , shapes and sizes into the field of outdoor furniture . Since these furnishings are designed primarily for comfort , they represent wide departures from traditional furniture design and their shape is usually determined by functional considerations .  | The best porch furniture is made from willow , a wood easy to handle , light , strong , flexible and less brittle than cane , which is usually employed only in the seats of chairs . It does not require varnish . Belgian and Polish willow furniture is less expensive than the American product . Reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in a great variety of thicknesses . Open weaves , lattice weaves and basket weaves are the designs employed . Reed furniture should always be woven , although sometimes the reed fabric is cut out and tacked onto the structure of the chair . If this is done , the fabric pulls loose from the places where it is tacked , or loses its shape . Fiber furniture is woven from ropes made of paper bound together with glue . Although it seems flimsy , fiber weave is actually extremely substantial . Bentwood chairs and lounges are made by steaming round strips of wood until they become pliant , when they are pressed into the required shape and left to dry . Bentwood is obtainable in most colors . Metal furnishings used on the porch are similar in design and construction to those used indoors . Furniture used on the porch and in the garden includes gliders , sun parasols , chairs , tables and chaise longues . Garden chairs and tables naturally must be sturdier than furniture protected by a roof and they are usually made of stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rustic furniture is made from natural wood with the bark left on . Outdoor metal furniture can he painted in strong colors with striking effect . Garden furniture was highly developed in Italy and many modern constructions are adaptations of Italian designs .  | You can refinish your own furniture if you choose , and it is a job that repays care . If you have happened to acquire an antique the beauty of which has been concealed by paints or shellac , you will enjoy restoring the piece to its natural wood . If you do n't feel competent to do the job , expert cabinetmakers will , and should , do it for you . The first step in refinishing is that of removing the old finish . Begin by protecting your hands with rubber gloves , and then apply varnish remover to the surface . After the remover has been allowed to stand for a while , you can rub off the old varnish with steel or copper wool , or lift it off with a putty knife . Repeat this process until the surface is completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if there is dirt in the pores , cover the surface with oil consisting of one part raw linseed oil and two parts turpentine . After you have removed the varnish , apply oxalic acid to get rid of any dark spots that may remain . Then dry the surface and sandpaper it until it is smooth and even . Rub with the grain to avoid scratching the wood . If the wood has been dented , fold a blotter several times , dip it in warm water , and apply it to the injured spot . Press a warm iron on the blotting paper until it dries out . Repeat this until the dent disappears . If you find small holes in the wood after sandpapering , fill them with wood dust secured by glue . Of the various finishes which can be applied successfully , oil is highly effective in bringing out the color and grain of the wood . Hot oil high-lights the colors best ,  | but cold oil should be used on intricately carved furniture ; hot oil is apt to congeal on the carving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing each coat to dry before the next is put on . Polish with a coarse linen or wool cloth . Generally an interval of two days should be allowed between each coat of oil . Each coat should , of course , be polished separately . Oiled wood is protected against extremes of temperature , moisture and scratching . A coat of wax can be substituted for a few coats of oil , but the base of the finish should be oil . An excellent wax can be made of beeswax finely shaved in turpentine . Stain as a finish should be used only for woods of inferior color . In selecting stain colors , consider the size and use of the furniture piece . Since oak , walnut and mahogany are used only in the making of large and heavy furniture , do not stain smaller pieces in these colors . The effect will be incongruous . For hardwoods , use a penetrating commercial stain . New and soft woods require a mixture of the standard walnut and mahogany stains , or a specially prepared oil mixture . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to harm the color . Stained woods must be shellacked to fill the pores of the wood . Several thin layers of shellac should be applied until the pores are full . After each coat is dry , rub it with steel wool . Then put a piece of wax on a folded cloth and rub a thin coat of wax on the shellacked wood , using a circular hand movement . When the surface is d ry , polish it with a linen cloth , rubbing with the grain . The beauty of skilfully waxed woods increases with age . It is n't advisable to try to varnish wood yourself . The technique of varnishing is difficult to learn , and had better be left to an expert .  | THE CARE AND CLEANING OF FURNITURE Oil finishes should be renewed once a year on all kinds of furniture . Modern heating dries out wood so rapidly that it is wise to oil woods from time to time within the year , using an oil dustcloth . Varnished furniture should be cleaned often with a chamois rag saturated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a solution of warm water , turpentine and linseed oil , apply it to the wood , and then polish with a fresh cloth . The application of furniture polish is sometimes necessary to complete the job . Never use soap . If water or alcohol has turned the varnish white , rub the injured spot with flannel moistened with camphor or essence of peppermint , to soften the finish . This should be promptly dried with a clean cloth . When the spot has dried thoroughly , rub the wood with furniture polish . To give lacquer a gloss , rub the finish with pure paste wax . Do not use polish or oil-cleaner on lacquer , since these materials stick to the surface and in time coat it with a sort of bluish film . If the surface is already filmed through the use of these cleaners , you can restore the original finish by rubbing it with a cloth steeped in green soap , then rubbing with a damp cloth , and drying the surface with a soft cloth . If the waxed surface turns white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rub in fresh wax . Finger marks can be removed by rubbing the surfacc with soapsuds and restoring the finish with furniture polish . Woods are affected by heat , cold and humidity . Furniture placed near a radiator will dry out and shrink .  | Eventually the joints will loosen . Pieces kept in a damp room will buckle and swell . There is no way of preventing either of these conditions except by controlling the atmosphere of the room . Never push or pull furniture from one place to another . Even the best grades are not constructed to stand such handling , and sooner or later the joints will become loosened . Either lift your furniture and carry it , or equip the legs with casters . The care of upholstered furniture is discussed in the chapter on fabrics .  | THE study of color has become a science ever since Sir Isaac Newton succeeded in breaking down daylight into its seven component spectral colors by means of a glass prism used as a filter . Before that , even from the most remote times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color associations , however , frequently differed with race . Thus in China white is a mourning color , while to us it is a symbol of purity and joy . The early Christian fathers devised an extremely elaborate color symbolism which even today we unconsciously use . Thus we think of purple as a symbol of justice and royalty , white as purity and peace , pale blue as hope , gold as power and promise , and red as passion . Subsequent investigation based on scientific experiment has proved that many of these symbolical associations are founded on psychological reaction to the stimulation of the eye nerves . After the true physical character of color was discovered by Newton , the advance of color science was relatively rapid . Once we knew that color exists only in light , it was easy to experiment with it . Spectrum colors have a constant order of red , orange , yellow , green , blue , violet and indigo . It was soon recognized that the center colors ? yellow , green and blue ? were the most restful .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum consists of advancing colors and the blue half of retreating colors . Because of this we are able to speed animal and plant growth with red light and retard it with blue . We also know that if an object is painted red and one identical in size and shape is painted blue , the red one will appear both nearer and larger . We have also learned a great deal about the effect of color on human emotions . We know that red is stimulating and sometimes irritating , that purple is depressing , that blue and green are restful and that yellow is gay . And knowing these things , we apply them to decoration . Considerable investigation has been made of human reactions to color . It has been proved that about fortyfive percent of American men prefer blue to all other colors . Red and purple follow to the tune of about twenty-two percent , while green , yellow and orange each received a vote of about three percent . The remaining two percent went to black . In general , men prefer cool colors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference for the warm side of the spectrum . Red is their first choice to the extent of forty-two percent with purple , orange , green , blue , black and yellow admired in the order named . Children like their color strong . Experiment proves that they prefer blue , red , yellow , green , white and black in that order . Color is your most effective weapon . With it you can compensate for the lack of many things . This is especially true in regard to the quantity or quality of sunlight your rooms may get . As a general rule , rooms with  | a southern exposure should be decorated with cool , retreating colors and rooms with a northern exposure should have a warm , advancing color scheme . Blues , soft blue-greens , dark cool browns , especially those with a green cast , greys of all types , beiges and other muted colors are most suitable for a room with southern exposure because they tend to be lightabsorbent . Clear white is an excellent accent color for a southern room , since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors . It is also a good policy in a room of this type to avoid too much pattern and surfaces that tend to reflect light . Rooms with a cold , northern exposure should be decorated with colors that have considerable red or yellow in their composition . These are advancing colors and , especially when any of the reds or red purples are used , the size of the room becomes an important consideration because these colors have a tendency to make a room seem smaller than it actually is . Striking contrasts of color are also more effective in a room that gets little direct sunlight . The colors that we use in our homes are made of both paint pigments and dyes . In other words , they are chemical compositions and not broken-down light . For this reason we have a different basic color theory for them than we have for light . This simple and workable theory is quite old but was greatly improved in recent times by the late Albert H. Munsell who devised an ingenious system of color notation . This theory assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black is an absence of color .  | This chart clearly indicates the effect one color has on another . The three primaries , red , yellow and blue are shown in black . Red at the tip of the wheel if mixed with yellow ( right ) makes orange . Blue ( 1 ( .1 ' 0 combined with yellow makes green . Blue and red make purple . These mixtures are secondary colors . Mixing a color with its complementary or opposite color results in a neutral grey tone . Thus red mixed with its opposite blue-green in equal amounts results in an off shade of grey . The diagonal line through the wheel separates cool and warm colors . Purple , purple-blue , blue , blue-green and green are cool . Yellow-green , yellow , orange , red and red-purple are warm . Cool colors are receding and warm are advancing .  | All other colors are worked in combinations of three primary colors ? red , yellow and blue . Theoretically , when any two of these are mixed in equal parts , they should give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength have yet been manufactured that will do this . However , red and yellow should make orange , red and blue should make purple , and yellow and blue should make green . Thus orange , purple and green are secondary colors . Carrying this further , we develop tertiary colors by adding more of one color to its immediate neighbor . Thus red added to orange makes an orange-red . For convenience in making comparisons in color and because the entire theory is based on the repetition of a principle , these colors are usually arranged in a circle . According to this theory , an equal combination of red , yellow and blue should make grey , which is the exact center of white ( all color ) and black ( no color ) . The same thing obviously should result from a mixture of any color in the circle with its exact opposite . These opposites are called complementary colors . Thus red becomes greyish when its opposite , blue-green , is mixed with it . Complementary colors also have a tendency to intensify each other when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-green would appear a brighter red than if it were surrounded by orange , orange-red , purple or purple-red . For the sake of clearer determination , the terms hue and chroma are used in referring to color . Hue represents the actual color ? red , green , blue or yellow , no matter whether it is light or dark . Chroma , on the other hand , indicates the intensity of the hue . Thus white has the palest chroma and black the darkest . When white is  | mixed with a color we have a tint . When black is mixed with it we have a shade . This knowledge is valuable when you are trying to visualize a color scheme . The first step toward developing a practical color scheme is to analyze your room . Determine its orientation and hours of greatest use . Do n't begin to select your furnishing or wall colors until you have considered these important points . The next considerations are the size and proposed style of the room . Once these have been determined it is relatively easy to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless you desire a formally decorated room , choose rather neutral tones for the walls . Next select a complementary color for the draperies and floor covering . After you have done this you can work on contrasting accessory tones . Do n't try to use more than three main colors in any room . Let your small accent color supply the vitalizing color shocks . Once you have arrived at a good color distribution , consider the effects of pattern and texture . Too much pattern will make the room seem busy , and textures must be carefully chosen because of their peculiar qualities of light absorption and reflection . Some textures , such as velvet , absorb the light , while satin will reflect it . Because of these textural idiosyncrasies , care must be taken to have the color just right . Dull finished walls and materials will make a color seem darker than the exact shade of color will seem if the surface of the material has a sheen . Every period has had its distinguishing color characteristics . It is therefore quite easy to achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme . The following is an analysis of the character of the color schemes during the various periods discussed in Chapter II : Louis XIV . Rich , majestic colors ranging from medium to dark but of clear tone . Reds and blues predominate . Louis XV . Clear pastels . Decidedly feminine in character . Louis XVI . Clear medium to pale colors , most of which are cool in character . French Provincial . Simple livable colors recalling tree tones and nature in general . Directoire and Empire . Sharp and rather heavily bright military colors . Jacobean . Dark , dull and masculine , contrasting between dark vivid colors and greyed tones . Queen Anne . Rather gay oriental colors . Chippendale . Livable , unaffected and harmonious colors , all toward the soft , medium side of the palette . Adam . Subtle off-shades that verge toward pastels . Hepplewhite and Sheraton . Clear and light colors that are both sophisticated and gay . Regency . Similar to Empire colors but lighter in tone . Early American . Simple , livable colors that are rather neutral in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phyfe . Light and cheerful colors of equal value . Victorian . Deep , pompous and rather ugly combinations . Modern . Neutral tones with bright accents . Peasant . Clear and bright . One of the most interesting uses of color is that of changing the apparent size of a room by the application of it . This may at first seem sheer nonsense , but it actually works . We know , of course , that some colors are  | advancing and others are receding . Obviously then , if a wall is painted red , an advancing color , it will seem both closer and larger than a wall painted blue , a receding color . This also holds true for color on the ceiling and floor . If your ceiling is too high , you can bring it down visually by painting it a darker color than the walls . Another way of making a ceiling seem lower is to divide the room into horizontal color elements . If yours is a traditional room , you can paint a dado and a cornice a color that contrasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it is modern , you might try horizontal bands of color on the walls . If your chimney breast seems too wide for the room , paint it a soft dark color and paint or paper the remainder of the wall with a light color . If you use a pattern , select one that has a horizontal quality . The reverse of this is true for the narrow chimney breast . The use of different colors on different walls of the same room has been revived by contemporary designers . Actually it is an old American custom . It was commonplace in a Colonial house to have the mantel wall of a room painted in a color that contrasted with the remaining three walls . Painting one or two walls of a room in a contrasting color is an efficient method of changing the room 's apparent size and shape , at the same time contributing a lot to the room 's decorative interest .  | One of the oldest methods of indicating the exact shade or tint of a particular color is to give it a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sky , various fruits and flowers , or from minerals . Unfortunately this is an inaccurate method . The colors of the sky are constantly changing . Just exactly what do we mean when we say sky blue ; is it the cold clear greyish tone of the north or the deep blue of a tropical sky ? In discussing decorative colors it is far more satisfactory to associate particular shades and tints of various colors with particular decorative styles . As we know each decorative period had its own characteristic taste in color . The following recipes for mixing various tints and shades of the seven colors most frequently used as decorative backgrounds are based on these tastes and the reason in each case is given for the color selected . Obviously many of these colors are interchangeable . Thus for example , a Louis XIV tint could be used in a Chippendale , Sheraton , Hepplewhite or Federal room .  | A Room is a space enclosed by walls , floor and ceiling . Most people are inclined to think of the character of the room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furniture and decoration it contains . They forget that while furniture can be moved and its function changed at will , the walls of the room can not be altered without considerable expense . And walls , because they are permanent architectural features , often contribute more to the appearance of a room than any other single factor in its decoration . Partly in reaction against the fussiness of the Victorian era , modern wall decorations tend toward simplicity of design and color . Simplicity is an excellent thing when it is consciously produced as a part of the decorative scheme . But carelessness is not simplicity ; you can not remove the influence of the walls on your room plan by wishing it away . If your walls are negative , they will drain away the character of the room entire . Make them a definite contribution to the feeling you want from your interiors . People have been doing it for centuries , and it 's easier to create interesting walls today than ever before in the long history of interior decoration . The architectural style of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the " given factor " on  | which you base the adornment of your room . Therefore your chief concern in decoration is the finish which you give the walls as they are already constituted . The periods most popular today , those of the seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth centuries , regarded wall decoration chiefly as surface adornment . Finishes were applied for the sake of their own beauty and interest . The modern functional style , on the other hand , is prone to use finishes which emphasize the utility of walls and their architectural structure . Contemporary decoration brings out the strength of a wall , its use in supporting the ceiling , its inherent geometric design . Both modern and period modes rely on finish to relate a wall to the general decorative style . But finish is not only useful in striking the keynote of period design ; it has another function as well . As has already been mentioned , walls are so important a factor in the room that their position in the decorative scheme must be decided definitely , or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up your mind whether you are considering your walls as background into which the furniture blends unobtrusively , or whether you look upon your wall decorations as objects of beauty in themselves , perhaps dominating and setting the tone of the other room adornments . Every finish is intended to create one or the other of these effects . Your choice should be dictated by your desire to play up the walls or to reduce them to a subsidiary position . There are two kinds of wall finishes . Structural finishes are those materials like wood , brick , stone , plaster  | and paint , which are an actual part of the wall itself . Decorative finishes ? wallpaper , tapestries , murals , fabrics ? are applied after the wall is finished . Both types of finish are flexible . They may either dominate the room or furnish a subdued background . Wood paneling is familiar to everyone . Before central heating , it was used in the homes of the rich to keep out the cold . It is now much less expensive , and is particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has also been adapted to modern design . Light woods strike a luxurious note ; darker woods give the room a formal , masculine quality . Paneling is a strong decorative factor , and should not be used in rooms where the walls are to act as backgrounds to the furniture . Glass is a structural finish recently developed by the modern movement . To architects of previous ages , glass seemed much too fragile a material to use as an integral part of the wall . But the glass bricks recently invented are sufficiently sturdy to justify their use . Glass bricks may be translucent , admitting light and reducing the number of windows needed in a room . Or they may be transparent , removing the necessity of windows altogether . Interesting effects may be achieved by building an interior wall of glass brick , thus giving a feeling of spaciousness to both of the rooms which it divides . Glass walls are , of course , most suitable to modern interiors . Brick and stone , universally used for interior walls in ancient and medieval times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for period homes and for informal country houses , especially those designed in the American manner . Brick walls painted white are often used in modern interiors . Imitation stonework has been  | used from time to time , but it is generally to be avoided because the imitation is easily detected and gives a cheap effect . Plaster is the most common wall finish today , because it is effective either painted or left in its natural color . It may also be covered with wallpaper . Besides the smooth plaster surfaces , there are special finishes which are appropriate to different decorative styles and periods . Sand float , for example , is a mixture of sand and paint which produces the rough texture used for peasant interiors . Plastic paint , made by mixing paint with clay , gives an impression of depth to a painted wall ; it is often overlaid with transparent glazing liquid which increases the three-dimensional effect . The special textured finishes may be treated in a variety of ways to get the effect most harmonious with the style , size and light capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular in previous periods are now returning to favor . Parget ( molded plaster ) and intaglio murals ( mural designs built up in low relief in the plaster ) are frequently a part of the more elaborate modern wall finishes . Paint is today a universal method of bringing plaster walls into harmony with the color scheme of a room . Walls painted in solid colors are easy to harmonize and economical to take care of . In choosing paints , you should be careful to keep in mind the size of your room and the amount of light it gets . Small , sparsely lit rooms brighten immediately when you paint them in light , gay hues . Whenever you can , choose the colors for your draperies and upholsteries at the same time you decide how you are going to paint your walls . If you paint your walls in one of the softer and lighter colors , in your tex- tile furnishings , a subtle , balanced chromatic harmony will characterize the room . Glazing the paint gives brightness but incurs the danger of glare if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward striking effects , you may use luminous paint , which glows in its original colors when the lights are turned out . Painting a plaster surface is not a difficult job , and if you see that it is done carefully , the paint should last indefinitely without cracking or peeling . Do not paint plaster walls until they have been allowed to stand for several months . Then put on a priming coat . See that this sinks thoroughly into the plaster , or the final coat will be splotchy and uneven . When you repaint a wall , remove all grease and dust with soap and water before you apply the new paint . And if the paint has loosened anywhere , give the loose spots a priming coat before repainting the entire wall . It is always best to remove wallpaper before painting because it might become loosened later on . There are two standard painting techniques . One is the so-called brush finish , and the other is stippling . Brush finish , when well done , is especially good for dark-colored walls , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this technique catch high-lights which give a dark wall considerable liveliness . Stippling , which is done by two painters , one of whom brushes on the final coat of paint while the other follows him , pounding the wall lightly with a sponge or a stippling brush , is best for a light-colored surface . Stippling always results in a mat finish . Special painting techniques , like misting and spattering , should be used with caution . Unless they are done skilfully and with harmonious colors , the results are  | likely to seem a bit too sensational for most rooms . In spatter finish , a bright color is sprayed or spattered on a dull one . Misting is similar . Here the paint is sprayed on the wall with a spray gun . Spatter finishes and their like are most effective and least harshly obtrusive when the colors appear to blend at a short distance from the wall . If the spattered or misted finish is too obvious , it will distract all attention from the rest of the room and defeat the purpose of the decorator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling 's first function is to increase the distribution of light in a room . For this reason it is usually painted in white or in a lighter shade of the wall color . Lately , decorators have been experimenting with contrasts between the color of the ceiling and the color of the walls . They have begun to paint ceilings in a gold or in some dark solid color , which gives a rich , luxurious feeling to the room . When this effect is attempted , the color of the ceiling should be repeated somewhere in the furnishings of the room . Older decorative periods supply many examples of elaborate ceiling designs , but few of them are suitable for general use today . Ceilings with decorative patterns carried out in paint or molded plaster belong to definite period styles like Empire or Georgian or Colonial American . They should not be used in small rooms . Vaulted ceilings were developed in tropical countries to allow the air to circulate . They , too , are usually " period " and are only appropriate to formal rooms of considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , belonging to every period of architectural construction . They are beautifully appropriate to houses which cultivate a rustic or primitive effect . Structural finishes only dominate a room when their , colors and patterns are extremely striking . The applied finishes ? wallpaper , tapestries , fabrics , murals , pictures ? are added later for the direct purpose of adorning a room in a pretty , conspicuous way . The horrible example of Victorian ornament has made us a little afraid of elaborate applied finishes , but we need n't fear them . They wo n't shout us down if we give sufficient thought to their relationship to the other factors in the room . Properly balanced with color and pattern , they will make our rooms unique , personalized , expressive of our ideas and tastes . Wallpaper : The long popularity of wallpaper is easy to understand . Before its importation into Europe from China about 1500 , only the rich had been able to afford mural designs on the walls of their homes . Wallpaper made a great many patterns available to people of moderate means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its varieties are almost innumerable . A few recipes will enable you to adapt modern wallpapers to your needs . Since wallpaper designs flourished in each recent decorative period , it is comparatively simple to carry out a period room in paper designs . English interiors fairly cry out for 18th century scenic pattern or Chinese designs , for it was in this period that English wallpapers , much influenced by the Chinese , flourished at their height . The Queen Anne , Georgian and Regency  | periods can all be matched by wallpapers of the time ; even furniture periods , like Chippendale and Sheraton , have their appropriate papers . Floral designs were the specialty of the French 18th century period , while the Directoire , Empire and Federal American interiors were usually accompanied by large-scale scenic panoramas executed in great detail . If you are papering a period room , a brief study of the style you have chosen will enable you to choose the accompanying wallpaper . The early machine-made wallpapers were banal and vulgar , and as a reaction today , designs have tended toward simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as it has affected all the other decorative factors . The low furniture of modern rooms makes it possible to use intricate scenic papers which can be viewed in their entirety , without obstruction by chairs and ornaments . The functional tendency has encouraged the development of wallpapers especially suited for use in each room of the house . Children 's rooms , for example , can be appropriately decorated in bright , lively patterns , often depicting sports , machinery or mythological stories . Rooms constantly in use should be papered in designs which all members of the family will enjoy , while rooms used only at certain periods of the day , such as the dining room , are appropriate places for the more striking designs which would pall if looked at too frequently . Fabrics : All sorts of experiments have been made in decorating rooms with textile fabrics . Although fabriccovered walls belong to the specialized room , they may he used for many walls if carefully applied . Cotton , chintz , cretonne , linen , canvas , burlap can be attached to a wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is necessary to clean them , you can do so by taking down the frame and removing the fabric . Fabrikoid , a composition material , comes in many colors and such finishes as leather , suede , metal and cotton ; it can be washed on the wall . Fabrics , especially those like cotton prints , lend a gay feminine touch to a room and especially so when the drapery fabric matches that covering the wall . Tapestry : Tapestries were originally produced to give warmth to the cold walls of medieval stone houses . Since they no longer have utilitarian value , they seldom reflect contemporary ideas and most of the tapestries woven nowadays reproduce old designs . Consequently , tapestries are chiefly suitable for period rooms , and the older tapestries are naturally the most valuable , as they usually are the most beautiful . Tapestries are striking ornaments and they are best placed in spacious , formal rooms without other decoration . They should be hung on wooden frames and allowed to fall freely in folds . They should never be framed . The framing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decoration and one which involves the greatest number of problems . Fortunately , everyone has an instinct about the proper way to place pictures in their frames and in the room . Even so , many rooms otherwise correctly decorated are marred by pictures which disturb the eye because they are badly framed and hung without relation to utility and beauty . Paintings are objects of beauty in themselves , and many people consider them the strongest and most in- Most pictures should be hung so that they form a wall composition and thus contribute to the decorative background . ( Top ) Four small pictures over a mantel . ( Center ) Four pictures of the same size add a horizontal quality to a modern room . ( Below ) A large picture flanked by small ones .  | teresting adornment a room can have . If you are a collector of pictures , you will know that paintings hung in a single room should be associated in period and style , if they are not actually the reproductions of a single artist . If pictures are important to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall treatments in harmony with the period of the paintings . Certainly you will want to frame them appropriately . Reproductions of oil paintings by early masters should be hung in frames of richly detailed carving , in harmony with the naturalism of the subjects . French paintings of the 18th century schools are usually hung in gilt frames , and gold blends with all oil paintings very well . Oriental paintings are framed with light mats and look their best against walls of simple color and design . Modern oil paintings , etchings , drawings and photographs should be hung in simple frames . Water colors and other paintings done on paper should have glass covering for protection from dirt and dust . From the point of view of wall decoration , pictures should be hung in places which seem conspicuously empty . People who possess a single painting of great beauty often prefer to hang it alone in the room in order to insure a concentration of attention . When several pictures are hung in the same room , they should be grouped together in a geometrical relationship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures should be arranged symmetrically , with the largest picture in the center . Small pictures may be placed at eye level ; larger paintings must be viewed from a distance and consequently can be hung considerably higher . The best rule for both picture framing and picture hanging is : use discrimination . Never hang pictures in  | inconspicuous parts of the wall merely because you have others elsewhere . Hang every picture that you really want people to see in an important part of the wall space . If you do n't care whether your pictures are easily seen , do n't hang them at all . Murals are the oldest form of wall decoration . The caves of primitive men were painted with beautiful representations of animals and natural objects . Today murals are too expensive for the average home and , because they are so prominent , are not used in rooms where wall decoration is subordinate to furnishing . Mural decorations for dwellings should be in relatively soft colorings and should be stylized rather than naturalistic , or else they will appear startlingly real and monopolize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or their subjects may suggest the use to which the room is put . The perspectives of murals add size to a small room . Murals should be placed on important parts of the wall space where their quality as painting will receive full value . Of course they should be in harmony with the style of the room . Murals are reproduced by several methods ? painting , stenciling and fresco being the most frequently used . Photomurals bear the same relation to wall decoration as does the older art of wall painting . The black and white of photographic murals makes them very dramatic , and they are likely to be startling and eventually wearisome unless great care is taken in selecting the subject matter . Photographs of people , machinery , buildings , while interesting at first , are later tiresome , partic- ularly if they dominate the room . An excellent use for photomurals in the home is found in the practice of reproducing floral and geometric designs , maps and stylized paintings , as a part of the wall design . If you already have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial photographers can do the work of enlarging for you . The Eastman Company 's Pm . M. C. Bromide 3 and 5 are the best papers on which to print enlarged pictures . Any paperhanger can apply murals to the wall at little cost . Photomurals can be printed in papers of several colors , but black and white is most common and most satisfactory . All walls should be thoroughly dusted from time to time . This keeps dust and grime from discoloring the finish . Most of the structural finishes can be washed with soap and water except wood paneling which should be waxed just as furniture and floors are . Many of the paints and papers on the market are waterproof . If you are sure that your wall coverings are waterproof you can wash them with cheesecloth or a cellophane sponge that has been dipped in warm sudsy water and then wrung out . Be sure you use a mild soap for this . Paints and papers that are not waterproofed are best cleaned with an art-gum eraser . Fabrics that are used for wall covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chintz , of course , can not be cleaned by any means other than periodical dusting . Pictures and murals should also be dusted . They can be thoroughly cleaned only by an expert . It pays to give as much attention to your walls as you give to your furniture .  | MANY persons are apt to forget that it 's four walls , a ceiling and a floor that they are trying to make into a livable unit when they set out to decorate . The kind of floor you have , the color , design and placing of your floor coverings are going to affect not only the comfort of your heels and toes and arches but your whole feeling about the design of any particular room . There is such a thing as design on the floor . Look about you in the room in which you are reading and you will see the design instantly , whether or not you have ever noticed it before . And if you obey the principles of floor design , you will have made a good beginning toward creating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By choosing the appropriate design , you can enlarge or diminish the size of a room , emphasize and bind together the arrangement of your furniture , and strike the keynote of the style in which your rooms are decorated . For after all the floor supports the room . It is the basis on which the walls and the furniture rest . Everybody expects it to give the appearance of strength as well as actually to be strong . Therefore the floor design you choose must not only harmonize with the color scheme of the walls and the period of the furniture , but must also serve as a definite and solid foundation for the kind of impression you want your rooms to make .  | Men have enjoyed wood flooring ever since they discovered how to lay boards correctly in the early Middle Ages . Since that time wood flooring has been adapted to almost every kind of building , and today we have many designs to choose from in creating the floor patterns for our own homes . In recent years most of us have been accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most appropriate floor for a modern house . But there are many other kinds of wood flooring which can be used with little added expense and sometimes with much greater beauty and appropriateness . If you are among the many who like your home to reflect the atmosphere of the Early American period , you will be interested in random-width flooring . The pioneers made their floors by cutting planks to the width of the trees themselves . The homespun appearance of these boards of varying width , pegged with wood pegs , blends well with furniture of the Colonial style , and they are easy to harmonize with the simplicity of a country home or a town house . But random-width planking is not limited to the Early American style . It was used everywhere in the early days of wood flooring , and is a feature of French Provincial and Early English interiors . In fact , it fits into any room in which the prevailing design is simple and informal . The irregular width of the board is as effective when the floor is painted as when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renaissance were built in France and Italy , designers discovered that wood floors could be made to carry intricate designs which would reflect the character of the individual building or  | room . These parquetry and marquetry floors are composed of small strips of wood fitted together , mosaicfashion , to form a pattern or a picture . Marquetry designs use woods of many different kinds and colors to create elaborate pictorial designs , often floral in character , which give much the same impression as an ornate carpet . Parquetry also employs varicolored woods to make geometric patterns , among the most common of which are the herringbone and basket-weave designs . The most popular varieties of herringbone are the 6odegree ( Italian ) and the 45-degree ( French ) , while variations on the basket-weave style are innumerable . Of course these intricately patterned floors are seen to best advantage in spacious , formal rooms ? rooms where the floor is dominant . If you feel that the Italian and French designs are too pretentious for the room you have in mind , an excellent modification of the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well suited to the American home . It consists of a simple basket-weave , laid in squares , and is both beautiful and unobtrusive . If you have taken pleasure in having a parquetry or marquetry floor laid , you will naturally want it to be in plain view . Therefore , it is best to have it laid in a room where you do not need many rugs , and where the walls and appointments do not detract attention from the floor . It is n't always practical , of course , to design a room without carpets or rugs , and a natural compromise for those who like parquetry is to lay a plain floor with a parquet border . Then you can place a carpet of a solid color in the middle of the room , displaying the parquet border while creating a livable oasis . Another compromise with utility which has recently  | become available to those who like parquet floors is the unit block , which comes in 8 " by 10 " or 63/4 " by 11 " squares , held together on the underside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive to lay down , form a parquetry pattern when the floor is complete . Beauty and appropriateness are far from the only things to be considered when choosing the surfacing for a room . The kind of floor a room needs is partly determinded by the use it will get . Hardwoods are necessary for floors over which a great deal of traffic passes , such as foyers , halls , and stairways . Floors done in parquetry or marquetry also should be made from hardwood , not only because of their more beautiful markings but also because such uncarpeted floors receive heavy use . Common hardwoods are walnut , oak , beech , birch , hazel and maple . Walnut is very durable and possessed of a beautiful color , ranging from the dark browns of the Italian and American " black walnut " to the grey-brown of the French and Circassian species . Oak is notably a strong wood , distinguished by the closeness of its grain and its beautiful markings . The best soft woods for flooring , red spruce , white pine , and long-leaf pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwise to use them in any main-traveled room or hallway . They require considerable care , and are very easily splintered or worn away . One of the most attractive designs which can be carried out in the soft woods is the random-width planking mentioned earlier . After a floor has been laid down , it is finished with stain , wax or paint . In choosing which finish you want for your rooms , you have another opportunity to carry out the feeling of your decorative design , not only in color and spatter but with stenciled and painted design .  | The stains , oil and water , are used for soft woods . Oil is easy to apply , it protects the wood from water and grease , and it penetrates increasingly as time goes on , giving the floor a darker color . Water stains also penetrate easily , but sometimes raise the grain of the wood , creating an uneven surface which has to be sandpapered smooth . Painted floors are easy to keep clean , and they provide interesting opportunities for color variations . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous in the middle of a painted floor . Even this has an advantage to the antique-minded . In this day of increasing preference for hardwood , wax is becoming a very popular finish . Besides giving a brilliant finish to the floor , wax brings out the natural color and texture of the finer woods . Be wary of giving too high a polish to a waxed wood ; glittering finishes lessen the value of your floor design instead of enhancing it because they distract the eye . The slipperiness of waxed floors is a hazard against which everyone is on guard by now . Wood floors have long been staple in this country , and their popularity continues today . But eclectic design trends have revived the use of stone , brick and tile , as well as creating new floor substances for special use . All these materials are useful in making a room lively and colorful , but they must be adapted to the specific effect you are trying to achieve . And their use requires care in selecting the furniture and accessories to go with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | wood , and they are among the most beautiful floor coverings ever invented . Their colors and patterns are susceptible to infinite variation , and their beauty increases as time goes on since time gives a sheen and depth to their surface . Faience tile ( earthenware covered with colored enamel ) has a lustrous finish and gives an effect of blended hues , since no two of the tiles are quite identical in color . Tiles are held in place by lines of cement ; they are of identical size and may be of several shapes ? rectangular , hexagonal , or octagonal . An experienced craftsman can lay them in beautiful patterns , like those of a rug . Tiles are most often used in sunrooms , halls and terraces , but they can be appropriately used in any room , especially in southern climates where they give an impression of coolness and actually help to keep down the heat . Brick floors are particularly attractive because of their soft colors and subsidiary hues . When the design of the room permits , they can also be laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different shapes and sizes . Brick floors can be waxed to emphasize their color . They are most often and most appropriately used in country homes , although bricks are excellent for a city home furnished in the French Provincial or the Colonial style . Maybe you 're a bit surprised to find cement and concrete mentioned as suitable floor coverings for the home , though everyone is accustomed to their use in public buildings . Cement floors are particularly suitable for play rooms and hallways , which get a lot of wear and tear , though they can be used elsewhere too , other conditions being equal . They are inexpensive to lay down , but they do not wear well . The cement itself is very du- rable , of course , but paint wears off them quickly . However , there are special cement paints and tints on the market which stand up longer than ordinary oil or floor paint . A well-painted cement floor can serve as an excellent foundation for the color scheme of your room . Of the many composition floors now available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linoleum , in a solid color , makes a good background for rugs , or by itself it will create much the same effect as does a painted concrete floor . Printed or inlaid linoleums bear elaborate patterns which have to be matched with the design of the room . It is difficult to replace printed linoleum , because it wears out most quickly in heavily traveled spots and the design has to be matched exactly in making repairs . Inlaid linoleum lasts much longer because the color goes all the way through the backing . Linoleum must be laid on a flat , dry surface . In the long run , it is better ? and cheaper ? to have your floor laid by the service department of the store from which you buy it . The best and most durable linoleum is the thickest-gauge . Other composition floors , such as cork , rubber and asphalt tiles , gypsum , magnesite , mastic and Zenitherm , are noiseless and easy on the feet . The composition tiles resemble earthernware tiling in appearance , and are a good substitute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that asphalt becomes soft in hot weather . Rubber and Zenitherm floors have a wider color range than asphalt because the material is basically dark . It is well to lay composition floors with metal strips , which prevent cracking and warping to some extent . One of the definite advantages in using composition floorings is their adaptability to all types of design .  | It is possibly more difficult to decide what kind of floor coverings you want for your rooms than it is to choose the most beautiful and useful floors themselves . For one thing , there are so many different kinds of rugs ; for another , differences in quality are great yet hard to detect . There are , alas , no easy formulas to guide you in your choice . If you really want the best of all the many floor coverings the modern world offers you , you will educate yourself in the subject sufficiently to become quality-conscious ; not only by reading this book , but also by looking carefully at carpets and rugs available for purchase in America today . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject with a long history . There are several differences between carpets and rugs . A carpet is finished on two sides , while a rug is finished on all four sides by means of warp threads finished into fringe and sometimes merely selvedge . Design in carpets is a matter of all-over pattern , while in a rug the pattern is a complete design often having a border on all four sides . Carpets range usually from 22/ inches in width to as much as 30 feet . Generally , however , the most popular widths vary from 27 inches to about Is feet . The most popular size for large rugs is 9 x 12 feet . These are usually carried in stock up to 12 X 15 . Anything over this size must be made to order . Carpets and rugs have always been made from much the same materials ? wool , cotton , linen , fiber , silk , paper , grass , felt , and so forth . But what determines the beauty and utility of all kinds of rugs is their weave and design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn- mon weaves and textures will enable you to judge the durability of a rug as easily as you decide on its beauty and appropriateness . There are , roughly speaking , three different types of floor covering : those that are made commercially , those that are made as native crafts , and Orientals . Obviously , the commercially made floor coverings have the greatest sale and widest application . Among each of these types there are naturally a great many different types of weave and design . Commercial manufacturers have also successfully reproduced various kinds of handmade rugs , including Orientals and hooked rugs . One of the best-known commerical rug weaves is the Axminster . This weave can be readily identified by the fact that it can be rolled lengthwise but not crosswise . This weave resembles hand-woven rugs because each tuft forms part of the design and because of the closeness of the weave which allows great variety and detail in design . The tufts are inserted into a stiff jute backing and , while they are bound down , they are not knotted . Axminster rugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater width may be obtained by special order . Newly laid Axminsters have a tendency to shed but this soon corrects itself . The Brussels weave , which was once more popular than it is today , is made much the same as a Wilton weave , except that loops and not tufts are seen on the surface . The Brussels , also like the Wilton , is made on a Jacquard loom and may be had in a variety of patterns and colors . Chenille weaves are as furry and soft as the caterpillar from whence comes the name . Chenilles have  | been growing in popularity because they are not only among the handsomest but also among the most flexible of floor coverings . They are available in both plain and mixed colors and may be had in a number of different surface treatments . Chenille rugs are very easy to identify because of the soft appearance of the surface texture when rolled . Since chenille is entirely a surface weave , the surface should be closely examined . Chenilles are available in the so-called broadloom sizes ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpets and rugs of this weave also have a tendency to be linty for a while . American Oriental is a commercial name used to identify a special weave which enables commercial manufacturers to imitate the patterns of Oriental rugs . These rugs are made in such a manner that they may be specially washed so that they have a highly lustrous surface . Jacquard weave is a name used to indicate a type of machinery that makes a number of different kinds of carpet and rug weaves . The principle of this machine is based on perforated paper rolls that control the color and design mechanism that produces the finished rug . This is a very complicated method of manufacture that has fortunately given us the wide variety we now have in selecting floor coverings . Tapestry weave is not particularly popular today because of its relatively uninteresting looped surface . It is one of the cheapest weaves , yet it requires the best quality yarns . This fabric resembles Brussels weave to a certain extent , but it is much thinner , since only one layer of yarn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble Wilton weaves but they are  | not as durable because there is less wool in the backing . However , they have more color possibilities than Wilton . Wilton weaves are made in two materials . The better of these is worsted , the other wool . Worsted Wiltons are considered to be about the best grade of commercial floor coverings available and are much more durable than wool Wiltons . The stiff quality of worsted yarn precludes a deep pile and consequently the wool Wilton always seems more luxurious than the worsted , although actually the worsted type is a much finer rug . The pile of a wool Wilton varies from / to / of an inch deep , depending on quality . The design of the latter type is very much coarser than that of the worsted fabric and the surface is not nearly so lustrous and velvety in texture . Both types of Wilton weaves are made on a Jacquard loom . In the very best grade of Wiltons there are as many as 128 tufts of worsted to the square inch . There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , native handcrafts . Many of them are of such limited production or design appeal that they are rarities . But , on the other hand , many of them are easily available . The most popular is that old perennial favorite , the hand-hooked rug . The reason for its popularity is obvious . Gay , adaptable to Colonial , Provincial , Victorian and even modern decoration , they enliven a room without being in any sense obtrusive . They are available in a seemingly endless variety of pattern . Since they are essentially a manifestation of a people 's art , anybody can make one by drawing various colored materials through a coarse burlap backing upon which a design has been drawn . While they are considered typically  | American , variations of this method of manufacture are known to various peoples . Today many hooked rugs based on traditional American designs are made in China and Japan for export to this country . Other homemade types of floor coverings which are sometimes reproduced commercially are rag rugs and braided rugs . They make very nice scatter pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpeting is also often used for stair covering in country houses . Navajo , Algerian and Swedish Peasant rugs are native types of floor covering that go into the modern home . The first is a flat hand weave with a large pattern , usually in some combination of beige , white , grey , black and red . These rugs are very serviceable . Algerian rugs are also handmade but they have a fairly high pile . They invariably have small , simple geometric designs worked out in beige , grey , white or black . Swedish handmade rugs are very colorful , but their color is definitely sophisticated in character . There are two types of weave , one highpiled , the other flat . They are also available in a great variety of patterns ranging from floral designs to simple geometrics . Strangely enough , Swedish peasant rugs seem to fit in almost every type of decorative scheme . Numdahs are colored felt rugs embroidered with gay floral and bird designs . They are suitable for country homes or as summer floor covering . They are made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiber and coco fiber . The grass fiber types are made in Japan . They are available in 2-foot widths and may be sewed together the way carpeting is . They are either natural straw or light green in color and have no pattern except occasionally a colored binder thread . Coco fiber rugs are much  | stronger . Their design is bright in color and as a general rule consists of simple floral and geometric patterns . Among the other handmade and rather expensive floor coverings are the sculptured or carved rug , Aubusson and Savonnerie weaves and various Orientals . Carved rugs are made by carefully shearing the surface of a high-pile handmade rug . This is an expensive procedure but the effect is well worth the cost . Usually the design is carved on a single colored surface . Even this process will probably soon be imitated by machine . Aubussons and Savonneries are also handmade weaves and are made in France . Both weaves are formal in design and delicate in color . The Savonnerie weave is a high-pile one while the Aubusson is a flat tapestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduced in a Wilton and in similar commercial floor coverings . The subject of Oriental rugs is difficult to deal with because they are bought not only for beauty and wearing quality but for value as well . Fifty years ago all Oriental rugs were woven by hand , and the competence of the weavers resulted in great delicacy and refinement of pattern . Today , Oriental rugs have been commercialized and some of them are machine-made . Consequently it is becoming increasingly difficult to judge the value of an Oriental rug on the basis of its origin and genuineness . It is safe to say that only antique Orientals are of great value today , though a fine hand-woven Oriental is still an excellent investment as well as a lovely adornment . The art of rug-making reached it apogee in Persia in the sixteenth century , and since that time Persian rugs have been valued highly throughout the world . There are many varieties of Persians , but in general-they arc  | characterized by soft and harmonious colors , and graceful patterns employing such natural objects as plants , birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , are more pictorial and naturalistic in their rendering of flowers and animals , and they are more brilliant in color than the Persian . Turkoman or Bokhara rugs are always red in color and nearly always of geometric design ; Caucasian rugs are much like them , except that other colors besides red are employed in the design . Anatolian ( Turkish and Armenian ) rugs are woven in bright contrasting colors and with angular patterns ; their varieties are so numerous that they are difficult to recognize . Chinese rugs , on the other hand , are comparatively easy to spot . They are woven from silk , and pastel colors predominate . Chinese rug-making flourished in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , but the lovely and intricate patterns of that period , depicting many religious and mythological scenes , are becoming rare now that the Chinese industry has been commercialized . All Oriental rugs can be distinguished by the care with which they are made , the closeness of the weave , and the fast color . The color dyes of the East have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is sometimes possible to tell a genuine Oriental rug by its color alone . The flexibility of the modern home permits great latitude in the choice of floor coverings . But many of the traditional rug and carpet patterns are associated closely with well-defined decorative styles , and if you are deco- rating a room in a specific style you will want to select a rug in harmony with the period you have chosen to carry out in your furnishings and color scheme . The ornate , richly colored beauty of Oriental rugs is seen to best advantage in specious rooms when the rug is in full view . Turkish and Persian rugs fit in with all of the formal styles . Chinese rugs , too , should be fully displayed . Their soft silken texture and pastel shades are suitable for bedrooms and other interiors decorated in white . If you are decorating in the Colonial or Federal American styles , hooked rugs carry out the period , although Oriental rugs were widely used then . Velvet and sculptured rugs and carpets consort with the functionalism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually used in rooms containing a good deal of furniture . Aubusson and Savonnerie patterns may be used in any formal French or late Georgian type room . Meticulous decorators will link the patterns of every rug they buy with the furniture arrangement and color values as well as with the decorative style of the room . Remember that a distinctive rug pattern is conspicuous . It will dominate and perhaps clash unless you are careful to see that it fills its proper place in the balanced whole . The floors of each room in your house get a different kind of use and have different decorative effects . Bedrooms , for example , require large , soft rugs which are easy to the slippered tread . Linoleums and other composition floorings belong in large , formal rooms where simplicity is the effect to be gained , or in dining rooms and foyers .  | The apparent size of a room can be appreciably altered by the way in which you cover its floor . A small room immediately becomes larger when you cover the floor with a single-color carpet laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of a large room is barren and uninteresting , you can break its monotony by scattering small rugs at various angles throughout the room or by using two different colors for carpeting . The variety of effects you can achieve by judicious planning is endless . But , by all means , do your planning before you buy your rugs . In each case , think of the use to which you mean to put your room and select the rugs accordingly . Wood floors are easy to keep clean . Spots or grease can be removed by rubbing them with wax . In fact , wax is an excellent protection for all kinds of floors . Waxed floors grow increasingly beautiful with time , and wax can be laid on over other finishes as well as on the natural wood . Paint is also a good protection for wooden floors , since it prevents water or grease from penetrating . Tile floors repay care , for their lustre increases with polishing . They should be swept with a soft broom , dusted with a dry mop , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry them as soon as possible after washing . Cement floors should be washed with scrubbing powder . The composition floors are easy to take care of . Brushing them with a dry mop is usually all that is necessary . do not use any strong scrubbing material or floor oil , because these soaps contain elements which decompose the composition surfaces .  | The life of rugs and carpets is greatly lengthened by constant care . They should be swept daily and cleaned once a week with a vacuum cleaner . In the case of valuable Oriental rugs , you should sweep in the direction of the nap so as to preserve it . It is better to lay rugs and carpets flat on the ground when giving them a thorough cleaning ; hanging a rug on a line tends to loosen its fabric . If grease has been spilled on a rug , carbon tetrachloride will remove it easily if used at once . Grease spots on which dust has collected can be removed by scrubbing with soap and water . Then put a piece of blotting paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve the nap . Ordinary liquids spilled on a rug can be removed with blotting paper or cheesecloth . Rugs should be shampooed or cleaned at least once a year . This is best done by an expert , who should also be called in when cigarette burns or insect holes make repairs necessary . It is possible to make perfectly satisfactory repairs even to badly injured rugs , but professional aid is preferable to home talent .  | FABRICS of all kinds strike the keynote of room decoration because they connect the color scheme and design of the walls with the furniture . Whether you are furnishing a room for the first time or are reupholstering the furniture you have , the fabrics you choose will determine the effectiveness of your style . Consequently your choice is very important , and it should be based on a good working knowledge of fabric manufacture and design . Men have been weaving fabrics for more than six thousand years , and many traditional designs that have come down to us remained popular through the centuries . These historic patterns , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dyes that were important in various phases of the development of weaving . Today , the number of both weaves and designs is overwhelmingly large . New ones are brought out every day . But new designs are generally adaptations of the best old ones , and if you are sufficiently familiar with these you will be able to judge fabrics correctly . Oriental textiles are famous for the antiquity and delicacy of their designs . The Chinese and Japanese , originators of silk manufacture , produced lovely , intricate  | designs dealing chiefly with religious and mythological subjects . Persia , too , was as important in the development of textiles as in rugs . Her designs were at first mythological and later , under Mohammedan influence , tended toward the abstract and geometrical . Persia 's favorite design was the tree-of-life motif , pomegranate , and she contributed the rondel , or circle enclosing the design , which has reappeared in most textile patterns since the earliest days . French textiles , which began to flourish after the Renaissance , reflected artistic tendencies which had their origin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baroque style of Louis XIV fabrics was followed by the luxurious but dainty and feminine designs of Louis XV . This in turn was succeeded by the classic tendency of the periods of Louis XVI , the Revolution and the Directorate , culminating in the imperial classicism of the Napoleonic era . Toward the end of the 18th century , the weaver , Oberkampf , produced textiles known as toiles-de-Jouy . These gay fabrics printed designs in one color only on a light background . They have remained popular to this day . Both in England and France , chinoiserie textiles , imitations of Chinese designs in which fancy is allowed free play , have been popular for two centuries , and have developed to a high degree of artistic perfection . English textiles are chiefly the chintzes , linens and embroideries which we have come to associate with the mother country . Printed cottons were imported from India until the 18th century , when the first great textile works were inaugurated at Manchester , forming the basis for the famous cotton industries of England . Indian patterns remained in vogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were followed by designs based on porcelain motifs and on classical figures and arabesques . Victorian textiles in England were chiefly naturalistic . The English designs were most notable in chintz and linen rather than in woven fabrics . Modern fabrics utilize all the designs of the past , and their number and variety are bewildering . Fabrics are therefore among the easiest factors in the decorative scheme to adapt to period design . Many fabrics now depict contemporary activities , such as flying , auto racing and manufacturing by machinery . Fabrics are made by shuttling weft yarn back and forth above and below warp yarn stretched on the weaving frame . This is the standard weave , typified by chintz , linen , cotton , taffeta and silk . Among the many variations on this weave is satin finish , produced by allowing the weft thread to jump several warp strands before it is woven in . This produces a smooth but loose finish . Damask and brocade , the embroidery fabrics , are made by weaving a design on a background of another weave with a smooth surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warp yarns on the diagonal . A second warp thread is added to the fabric when velvet is woven , producing a soft pile . The modern feeling about weaves is that textures contribute to the pleasurable effects of fabrics . In other words , we believe today that the sense of touch should be considered in addition to the sense of sight . This tendency is partly responsible for the great increase in variations of the standard weaves .  | There are three ways of determining the strength of a fabric ? by weave , yarn and by fiber . A weave is strongest when the warp and filling yarns are of the same tension , when the number of strands to the inch in each is the same , and when the warp and filler strands are at right angles to each other . The strength of a yarn is measured by the number of twists to the inch that the fibers have . These numbers run from two , in some wool yarns , to about two hundred , in silk , the strongest of yarns . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yarns from which they are made . The length , therefore the strength , of some common fibers is in this order : silk , ramie , mohair , wool , linen , mercerized cotton , cotton , rayon . It is difficult to discover what fibers go into many fabrics , but the closeness of the weave can be tested by holding the fabric up to the light and weighing it in your hand . You can judge the ability of a fabric to stand wear and tear by its weave , yarn and fiber . It is more difficult to judge the durability of color , because its utility is affected not only by the quality of the dye and the method of dyeing , but also by the types of yarn and weave cm ployed . Some fibers hold their color much better than others . In all cases , yarn has not " taken " its final color until it has been exposed to the air for a time . That is why it is so difficult to tell whether a fabric will hold color after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyeing . In pre-dyeing , yarn is dyed before it is woven , causing complete satration with the color . Less complete saturation occurs if  | piece-dyeing , when the fabric is dyed after the weaving . The least satisfactory method of coloring a fabric is that of printing the color on its surface . Printing rarely survives washing or continued use . In fabrics , price follows durability . You can judge how much hard treatment your textiles will receive before you buy , and make your purchases in accordance . If you keep in mind the strength of weaves , fibers and yarns , and their ability to take dye , you should be able to buy without being either cheated or dissatisfied . Remember that it is n't always necessary to spend a lot of money to get the fabrics the various parts of your rooms require . Many fabrics which are far from durable nevertheless are extremely decorative , and may be used with excellent effect in places where they receive little wear and tear . The colors chosen for fabrics are based upon the general color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good decoration . Yet the colors of fabrics can by no means be left to the last ? chosen after the walls and furniture have been given their colors . For fabric color is fixed and permanent , while decisions about the color of walls can be changed before the painter goes to work . Therefore , it is wise to obtain samples of the fabrics you are considering and compare them with paint samples before you actually buy any textiles . By that method you will avoid spending money on fabrics which later turn out to clash with the color scheme of your room as you finally decide upon it . Methods by which fabrics are harmonized with the  | color scheme of the room are discussed in the chapter on color . A word should be said here about the influence of texture on colored fabrics . Shades of color are very much affected by the relative smoothness of the texture of the cloth ; textures also cause shadows which alter the appearance of color and give it a different appearance under various lights . You must keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fabric colors your room needs . It is also excellent to remember that the textures of fabrics can be made to harmonize or contrast with the other surfaces in your room . Are the walls rough or smooth ? Does the furniture and the room design give a luxuriously formal or studiedly informal impression ? You do not want the elaborate formality of a brocade in what is otherwise an effectively simple room . So buy for texture as well as color and durability . By doing so you can point up the decorative scheme of the room and suggest the uses to which it is put . As has already been said , the number of weaves and yarns now on the market is endless , and it is unnecessary for the amateur to know them all . The following brief descriptions of well-known varieties will enable you to identify those you are likely to use : Armure is a rep background with a repeating small , conventionalized all-over pattern in relief .

Whether you are having your furniture upholstered or are merely fitting slip covers to it , you will have to make measurements of each individual piece before ordering your materials . The following general charts may give you some advance idea of the amount of fabric that will be needed : Large Sofa : 10 yards of so-inch material Small Sofa : 9 yards of so-inch material Love Seat : 6 1/2 yards of so-inch material Easy Chair : s to 6 yards of so-inch material ; 10 yards of 36-inch material Wing Chair : s to 6 yards of so-inch material ; 10 yards of 36-inch material Armchair : 4 1/2 to 5 yards of so-inch material ; 8 to 10 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material ; 1 yard of 36-inch material Chaise Longue : 3% to 5% yards of so-inch material ; 7 to 11 1/2 yards of 36-inch material Unless you are a furniture expert , you will probably not want to try to upholster your own chairs . But a brief description of the process will enable you to know what to expect of an upholstering job and how to detect inferior workmanship and materials . A good chair is upholstered in the following way : burlap is stretched over the springs and tacked to the frame , serving as a foundation for the padding , the best quality of which is long horsehair . The first layer of  | stuffing is again covered with burlap and then a second layer is added . Felt padding is placed along the back and arms of the chair , at places where the sharp edges of the frame might work through or be felt unpleasantly . In the best chairs cotton felt is used to produce a feeling of smoothness . Then a layer of muslin is placed between the padding and the upholstery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers . Finally , the fabric upholstery surface is added . For lightweight upholstering , armure , brocade , chintz , cretonne , artificial leather , damask , sateen , satin , taffeta and corduroy are standard fabrics . Standard heavier coverings are mohair , haircloth , monk 's cloth , moquette , velveteen , tapestry , velours , twill , denim , brocatelle , leather , plush and rep . Every department store , decorator or upholsterer can make your slip covers for you but many women who like to sew make their own . It is comparatively simple to do this if you know how to go about measuring your furniture . You start measuring a chair or a sofa from the floor in back of the piece , up and over the back , across the seat and to the floor in front . You allow two inches extra for hems and seams , and about eight inches for stuffing in where the back and seat meet . To get width you begin at the outside of one arm , down across the seat , and up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A loose cushion requires one yard and a half of fifty-inch material . After you have cut your material according to your  | measurements , pin it together with the reverse side out and trim it according to the lines of the piece . You can then sew it together , using stock piping at the seams . Be sure to leave an opening at one seam in the back for snappers or zippers so that you can remove the covering easily . The bottom can be finished with fringe or with a ruffle . If you want a ruffle , measure all around the chair , allowing for the fullness of box , knife or inverted pleats . Most dressing tables are thirty inches high . Determine what type of skirt you want , whether it is to be gathered , box , knife or inverted pleats . Also decide whether you want the skirt to go around the entire piece or just around the front and sides . In any case , it is probably well to have an opening in the front if the skirt is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms to tack it to , it would be well to stiffen the top of the skirt with buckram . Measure around the piece . If you plan to have pleats , allow three times this measurement for your material . If you are to have gathering , allow double the yard measurement . You can attach the skirt to the piece with hooks , tacks or snaps . If you use snaps , tack tape to the piece and sew half of each snap to the tape . Sew the other half of the snap to the skirt of the dressing table so that you can easily remove it for cleaning . If you want your bedspread to match your dressing table and draperies , it will have to be specially made . Measure the top in length and width , allowing about two yards extra in length if you plan to cover your pillows with the spread . If you finish the sides with shirring , twice the material is needed for the sides . If you use pleating , allow three times the side measurement for material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the sides are plain , seven and one-half yards if they are shirred and nine yards if pleated . A three-quarter bed requires the same yardage . A twin or single bed requires five and one-half yards for plain sides , six yards for shirred sides , and seven and one-half yards for pleated . A housekeeper 's first duty toward fabrics is to keep them dusted . Those with rough or complicated textures collect dust easily , and must be cared for often or the fabric will deteriorate . Fabrics should be vacuum cleaned regularly or brushed . Velvet and corduroy should be brushed in the direction of the pile . Moths are a menace . Some manufacturers try to protect you against them by mothproofing their products , but this process has only a temporary effect . Spray your fabrics from time to time and moths will stay away . Frequent brushing also helps . If the worst happens and you discover moth holes , have them rewoven by an expert . As for stains and spots , most of them require different treatments . There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . Water rings , blood stains , and wine and liquor stains can often be removed by rubbing with a wet cloth . Blood can sometimes be removed by the application of dilute ammonia . Wine stains , fruit stains , and ice-cream stains should be allowed to dry and then rubbed with a clean cloth and the carbon tetrachloride which is the foundation of many cleaning fluids . Chocolate and candy generally can be removed by rubbing with a cloth wrung out in warm water and then lightly brushed with carbon tetrachloride . Paint and enamel spots yield most readily to  | turpentine and a mixture consisting of equal parts of denatured alcohol , benzine and butyl . They should be scraped with a dull knife after this mixture is applied , and the process must be repeated several times . Mildew and iron-rust spots yield to rubbing with a cloth dipped in warm soapsuds if removed while they are fresh . Ink stains require a standard ink remover like Gartside 's Iron Rust Soap .

Rub a spot with care , beginning from the outside and working toward the middle .  | BECAUSE of their size , window draperies play an important part in the decorative scheme and some decorators try to play them up as the most important features in the room . But draperies , although they are conspicuous , are really part of the wall composition , the background of the room design , and should be treated as subordinate elements in the decorative scheme . After all , they are accessories to the window , and they are primarily intended to temper the light from a window , frame its view , and insure privacy . Therefore when you choose drapery materials , you should do so with the idea of fulfilling these practical functions as well as harmonizing your curtains with the colors and textures you have chosen for the walls and furniture . Most windows are rectangular in shape . Their angular severity is softened by the addition of appropriate curtains . Draperies cleverly arranged can also adjust the sizes and shapes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or enlarging its apparent size . Decide what purpose you want your window to fill and you will have the recipe for your draperies , which should be chosen in accordance with that purpose . The two types of curtains are glass curtains and over- draperies . Glass curtains are light , transparent curtains hung next to the window panes and are particularly useful in diffusing the light . For small windows , or in informal rooms , these are often sufficient in themselves . Usually they hang the length of the window , although today some decorators extend them to the floor . In French windows , the glass curtains are either fastened on rods at the top and bottom of the window , or they are hung at the sides when the windows are opened and drawn across at night when they are closed . Glass curtains are treated in the same manner on casement windows . Overdraperies are the principal curtains of a window and are usually of a heavier material than the glass curtains . All the fabric materials have been used for overdraperies and a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room . Overdraperies can do much to change a window 's apparent function in the decorative scheme . For example , windows of different sizes can be made to appear identical by hanging the curtains at an even distance from one another . The prominence of poorly placed windows can be minimized by matching the color of the curtains to the wall color . Or , if you desire to draw attention away from the architectural proportions of the room , you can choose curtains of a color which contrasts heavily with the wall . Valances , the draperies hung across the top of the window , can increase the apparent width of the window space and even make a room seem brighter than it actually is . Small windows admitting little light should , of course , be hung with comparatively small , transparent curtains , while if you feel that your rooms are getting too much light , you can easily remedy that condition by hanging heavy ,  | voluminous curtains over a great portion of the window space . The color and pattern of window draperies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme according to the wisdom of the designer . As has already been pointed out , curtains disrupt the room design if they are too prominent . It is better to let the curtains repeat or emphasize color and design rather than to take the lead in revealing them . Sometimes it is permissible to let overdraperies set the color scheme for the entire room , but usually their colors repeat those of the furniture or the wallpaper in another key . The question of whether to use plain or figured materials is decided by the presence or absence of patterned fabrics elsewhere in the room . Many decorators make it a rule to use patterned draperies in a room with walls of a solid color , and vice versa . Plain draperies are given piquancy by the addition of a border in another color , or in a pattern . For variety , both plain and figured curtains may be used in different rooms in the same house . Color , pattern and line are the three qualities which unite curtains to the rest of the decorative scheme . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much variation . As a rule , formal rooms require voluminous draperies reaching to the floor and , in especially luxurious interiors , draping over it to the length of a foot . Curtains which reach merely the length of the window are suitable for cottage , provincial and rustic interiors or for the smaller and gayer rooms of the house . Tying bark the overdraperies lets more light into the room , and the  | curve of the curtain produces a graceful effect , especially pleasant in a room where there are many straight lines . Tie-backs may be made of the same materials as the curtains , or of a contrasting material . An interesting effect is achieved by tying back one curtain , while the other is made to fall straight to the floor . A variation of this is to hang a single overdrapery on one side of the window , topped by a valance across the window width . The weaves and textures of curtains are often determined by the period style of the room . Damasks , silks and brocades are used for the 18th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are appropriate to the rural style of many of the American periods . For modern rooms , recently developed materials like cellophane , corduroy , permatex and various coarsely woven fabrics are strikingly suitable . The use of cornice boards in place of valances is a contemporary fashion which has interesting historical precedent . When estimating for draperies , you should measur the space from the floor to the top of the window trial , allowing whatever is necessary for hems . Most lightweight materials require a three- or three-and-one-half. inch hem at the top , while heavier materials need a four inch top hem . At the bottom the hem should be two inches and of triple thickness . It is best to allow eight inches of extra material for the top hem and six inch at the bottom while , if the overdraperies are to rest on the floor , twelve inches extra should be allowed . Remember that you want your curtains to cover the window completely when they are drawn . A good rule  | to follow in estimating is to secure ample fullness by making each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating patterns should have at least one extra repeat for each curtain , so that the curtain will have the same parts of the pattern at the same height above the floor . Glass curtains are finished with a handkerchief hem two and one-half inches wide , while ruffled curtains are finished with four-inch ruffles . Straight-hanging draperies are quite easy to make provided you have made accurate measurements . To insure the best hanging draperies , you must make the headings very carefully . One of the most satisfactory headings for a drapery that is either straight hanging or allowed to drape is the French heading . It is made by gathering the material in small folds about six inches apart and sewing these folds about four or five inches below the top of the curtain . The folds fall from the heading in fairly straight , evenly spaced lines . The French heading is very handsome when used with a heavy , exposed curtain pole and open rings . Box pleating is a more tailored variation of the French heading . This finish is best without a cornice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should space your pleats in about six-inch intervals . They are not gathered but sewed flat , and are best suited to straight-hanging draperies . The best type of heading for elaborate draperies is plain shirring , which is made by sewing down close but irregular gathers of material and then sewing rings on the underside .  | Valances and jabots should be folded on a board and sewed before being put up . It is also a good policy to make a muslin pattern for them before you cut your curtain material . The muslin can then be used for lining . It is a good idea to line all draperies . This is an inexpensive method of giving them extra weight and keeping out light . If your draperies do n't hang right , you can sew chain weights , which are manufactured for the purpose , into the bottom seams . Many people forget the decorative importance of tiebacks , cornices and other drapery hardware . There are , of course , wide varieties of patented devices for pulling draperies across the window . These naturally are strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there are other types of fixtures , such as cornices , tie-backs , rods and rings , that are well worth a little care in their selection . Recently there has been a revival of interest in molded brass cornices adapted from old models . They do a great deal to add finish to the decorative scheme . Draperies are usually trimmed with edgings of the same materials as the curtains themselves . In the past , fringes have been very elaborate , including , in the 18th Century , mold fringe ( wood turnings wound with silk . molded in such shapes as pendants and balls ) , tassels , and balls . Piping ( strips of material wound around a small cord ) is still used frequently , as is narrow grosgrain ribbon . Lighter materials are edged with ruffled .  | Gimps and galloons ( woven strips or tapes ) are used for the heavy , luxurious brocades , velvets and damasks . Selection of the proper trimming for overdraperies is an interesting task for the meticulous decorator , but the more intricate trimmings should be adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too showy , but are expensive as well . People are prone to forget the decorative possibilities of the window sill . Of course , if you have a narrow sill there is not much that can be done with it , but if the sill is a wide one , there are many things that will add interest . One of the most common and also the most beautiful treatments is to place a collection of old glass on the sill . Bright sunlight shining through the glass creates an extremely handsome effect . Green , growing plants are almost invariably a pleasant and effective addition to a room 's decoration and the window sill is the logical place for such plant displays . Cactus gardens are particularly interesting and dramatic windows-sill devices . These exotic plants thrive on sunlight and little water and are seen to best advantage when thrown into relief , as they are when placed before a window . These are just a few of a number of treatments you may adopt to add interest to the window and to the room . With a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The revival of interest in Venetian blinds has revealed their usefulness as well as their beauty . They permit  | ventilation while shading the room , and manipulation of their slats will throw the light toward the floor or ceiling , thus achieving the indirect lighting that is so much desired in modern decoration . The Venetian blinds of other periods were cordially hated by housewives as dust-catchers , but the modern types are easy to clean and efficient brushes for cleaning them are available whereever such household equipment is sold . Today 's Venetian blinds are also decorative features . Many windows require no other adornment . The blinds can be colored to harmonize or to contrast with the rest of the room , and tapes of various colors give a contrasting vertical line to the horizontal effect of the slats . Bamboo shades are available today in natural colors . The more elaborate Oriental shades are decorated with Chinese or Japanese paintings which lend an exotic touch when used in the right room . The linen shades common everywhere a few years ago are now less popular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has introduced such variations as accordion-pleated linen , and has occasionally covered them with photographic and painted designs . Draperies , like upholstery fabrics , require occasional ( lusting to prevent the accumulation of grime that weakens and discolors the material . A soft brush is an essential for this . Brushing at intervals , however , does not completely remove the dirt and so it is good economy to have the draperies dry-cleaned by an expert at least once a year . There is no satisfactory formula for restoring the color in curtains that have become bleached other than  | to have the curtains redyed , nor is there any remedy for fabrics that have been burned by the sun . Curtains and draperies should of course never be put away in storage until they have been thoroughly cleaned . Most window curtains can be folded when they are to be stored . On the other hand , it is best to hang draperies , since folding heavy draperies will often break the surface fiber of the curtain fabric .  | Two things are necessary in lighting a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places for the needs of the family ; second , to preserve and accentuate the decorative scheme of the room through appropriate lighting . Electricity has so recently revolutionized lighting that everyone is now conscious of the problems involved in balancing correct light with attractive lighting . Although much of the recent talk about correct lighting is simply propaganda for gadgetry , the new interest in light makes it easier to investigate ? and to solve ? the difficulty of combining beauty and use in artificial light . For utility , all rooms must be lighted for two different purposes . One is to provide a general , diffused light throughout the room . The other is to furnish direct , concentrated light for special occupations , such as cardplaying , reading , or sewing . The use to which each room is put determines how much of each kind of light you need for it . The development of indirect lighting has done much to solve the problem of general illumination . Light thrown on the walls or ceiling provides a soft yet distinct glow with a minimum of glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor lamps equipped with reflectors . These units should be distributed through the room so as to provide an even intensity of light everywhere . Another relatively inexpensive method is to place light bulbs behind the cornice at the top of the wall . This cove lighting reflects light onto the ceiling all around the room . A third and decorative way is that of covering lights with panels of frosted glass . If this method is to be used , you should be careful to arrange the panels so that no one will have to look directly at them for any length of time . Panels are particularly suitable to seldom-used rooms such as hallways and foyers . Individual lamps usually suffice for direct lighting for a specific purpose . Their placement should be worked out in connection with the grouping of the furniture for traffic and use , and their intensity measured by the length of time they are ordinarily used . Most power companies and department stores have services intended to determine the light intensity needed for any decorative situation . They will measure your lights and recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixtures . The distinct , general light needed for living rooms can be obtained best by indirect lighting . If floodlighting the ceiling creates too startling an effect , a distribution of floor lamps and urns will achieve adequate and pleasant lighting . Wall brackets and sconces , when they are used , should be shaded . Never leave light bulbs unprotected by a shade . Even when the bulbs are frosted , the light is too direct . When you plan your living room , you will of course put direct lamps near the most comfortable places for working and reading . But be sure the number of lamps and the distribution of inlets is flexible , for you  | will often want to change the position of a lamp temporarily for the purposes of conversation or games . Many persons pay little attention to the lighting of the dining room because it is used only three times a day . In their homes , the evening meal is apt to be conducted in Stygian gloom or in a theatrical glare . A strong indirect light , so placed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table , is an excellent recipe for dining-room lighting . Such a light can be used effectively with candles , which make the table a warm oasis , while the general indirect light insures good visibility for eating . Entrance foyers and hallways between living and dining rooms should be lighted generally . Be sure that the light , whether direct or indirect , is so placed that the stairs are plainly visible . Small side lights placed in the baseboard at the top and bottom of the stairway light the stairs and are an excellent means of preventing missteps in the dark . Light the kitchen strongly , and be sure to eliminate shadows . Small lights should be placed near stoves , sinks and cupboards so that you will not be standing in your own light when you are at work . A kitchen should have plenty of outlets for the use of electrical appliances . Bedrooms should be lighted in a soft glow suggesting rest , but there should also be plenty of individual lights for dressing purposes . A good reading lamp at the bedside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of a strong , concentrated light at the dressing table to enable her to judge how she will look under all kinds of light during the evening . Children 's rooms should be lighted indirectly whenever possible , and the light should be concealed for the protection of the child 's  | eyes . An excellent closet light is one which automatically switches on with the opening of the door . Bathrooms should be illuminated by a central light and well-placed lights beside the mirror . Small things have a great deal to do with lighting effects . Choose your lampshades carefully . Some shades , including parchment and silk , often allow too much light to pass through , and they do not distribute it as evenly as do less translucent shades . Ceilings and walls painted white or in glazed paint sometimes reflect light in a glare which is not only hard on the eyes but nullifies the color scheme of the room . Light can be redirected , but not reduced in intensity , by the use of mirrors , glass , and polished metal ornaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color factor . Decorative schemes which seem perfect in the daytime are often entirely altered when night comes because colors change their values under artificial light . Blue , for example , becomes a flat gray under the yellow light of most electric lamps , and red turns into orange . Even the fabrics change shade alarmingly , because the texture determines how much light a fabric will absorb . Under a green light , orange velvet seems yellow , while orange taffeta appears green . You may expect the colors of walls and room furnishings to change and take on different values when exposed to different lights . The following will give you an ides of what can and does happen to the most commonly used colors under certain colored lights :  | tern , this color tends to disappear . Hence the red in a floral pattern will seem to fade when exposed to a red light , as will blue , yellow and green in figured patterns when seen under lights of their own color . Some people , in trying to solve this problem , cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to white daylight as possible . Such a method is not only hard on the eyes physically , but displeases them aesthetically as well . Nor do colored lampshades help the situation much . Light coming through a lampshade turns every object in the room the same color as the shade . In the daytime , such lampshades may be an appropriate part of the decorative scheme ; at night they completely dominate the room . One method of counteracting this disturbing effect is to line dark-colored lampshades in white , so that the light is reflected from the white lining and does not shine through the colored shade directly . Fixtures must be carefully placed in the room to give direct or general lighting . Wall fixtures are usually selected to give diffused lighting . Wall fixtures are generally the maximum for a room of medium size . Sconces should always be shaded . Chandeliers should only be used in large , formal rooms or directly over the table in the dining room . Before you place either lamps or fixtures , it is a good thing to draw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think lights should be situated . Then draw circles around the lights to indicate the extent of their illumination . If the circles interlock and cover most of the floor space , you have placed your fixtures and lamps correctly .  | If you are furnishing a period room , you can buy fixtures in the Georgian , Queen Anne , Empire and Early American styles which will harmonize with the rest of your design . While antique fixtures were designed originally for oil or candle lighting , fitting them with electriclight bulbs sometimes makes them perfectly suitable for rooms of our time . As a general rule , however , this is rather an unsafe policy and an unnecessary one since there are many modern adaptations of period fixtures in which the beauty and correctness of the design are adjusted to the requirements of electric light . Modern fixture designs are generally simple and functional . Their first purpose is to give proper light . The shape and size of a lamp base has very little bearing on the light it gives , so you can select lamp bases freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like fixtures , can be designed in accordance with a period style , and their bases may be interesting as ornaments , like a painting or a piece of sculpture . Everyone is familiar with the materials in which lamps are available ? stone , marble , bronze , silver , glass , chromium , copper and wood . The purpose of lampshades is primarily to conceal the light bulb and its mechanical attachments . Materials from which they are ordinarily made include parchment , silk , metal , and , among the newer forms , celluloid , cellophane , glass , suede , glazed papers and various types of grasscloth . Shades may be either opaque or transparent , depending on whether you want them to distribute light or to concentrate it . Patterned shades are usually expensive and too many of them in the same  | room often bewilders the eye . The color of shades placed near each other should be related , and the shade should blend , not contrast , with the color background of the room . Almost any interesting objet d'art may be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even duck decoys . As a rule , converting a vase or similar object into a lamp should be done by an expert . However , it is possible to obtain standard socket and brass tube units that can be installed by the average handy husband . Lampshades are quite a different problem . Today they are made of almost every material ? fabric , paper or metal . Paper shades require careful beforehand planning so the radius of the shade will be of the right size . They should then be attached to the metal wire frame with a fancy paper that has a gum back . Metal shades may be cut out of sheet metal and carefully soldered and finished at the joint . They can then he painted before soldering to the frame , which should be a heavy one . In making fabric shades , both the lining and the facing should be sewed to the frame at the same time . It is also best , whenever possible , to use the fabric in one piece , tightly stretched and sewed to the frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stitches should be concealed with gimp or some similar trimming material . p 300 EVER since man first began to fashion utilitarian objects with which to carve and cook and kill , he has also tried to make them beautiful . Sometimes the beauty lay in the shape of the object , sometimes in an overlaid ornamentation . Probably the first ornament was votive , an effort to appease an exacting and fickle hunting god . Later it became an affair of sheer pleasure in aesthetic creation . Decorating was easiest on small , intimate objects , those things which we now commonly call accessories . Consequently we have today an enormous store of inherited accessories to reproduce and from which to draw design . Accessories are to decoration what costume jewelry is to dress : the lift , the accent , the personal touch . They are important beyond their size . Accessories are , fortunately , the things which we know best , because we buy them most often . An ash tray , a cigarette box , a vase or a lamp , is a common enough purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it haste and carelessness . You go to the lamp department . You see an enchanting lamp . You buy it and carry it home under your arm . You plug it into a socket and sit back contentedly , serene in the knowledge that you have done a household task . But how well have you done it ? True , the lamp is a lovely and graceful thing . But it is the lamp  | which was the inevitable choice for your room ? Does it grace the walls , the carpets , the curtains and the furniture ? Here is the trick in buying accessories : that they should always serve the unified decorative scheme . Buy no accessory without an active , vivid visual picture of the room in your mind . Not only its colors , but also its design and style and proportions . You are aided generously by the stores . There is no limit to the periods and types of accessory objects which they set before you . If they also occasionally dazzle you by the number of the selection , the fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by judicious choosing . Most of our room accessories are primarily utilitarian But the ones that always seem the most fun to buy are just gadgets . Figurines of china and blown glass , sea shells and ridiculously precious little antique snuffboxes we buy and love in exactly the same serious manner as children when they swap a jackknife for a bull's-eye marble . Obviously the easiest way to select your accessories is to buy only those pieces that are in the same style as the decoration of your room . There is no problem here because practically every type of antique pottery , glass , silver , and so on , is available in reproduction if you have neither the inclination nor the pocketbook to acquire originals . So far as modern accessories for a modern room are concerned , selection is entirely personal . This , as we have pointed out , is the easiest way . You know your period ; your match your accessories to it . But if , on the other hand , you are a free soul , ready to  | go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can create for yourself a room that distinctly reflects you and your tastes , regardless of periods or period connotations , by your own clever selection of accessories and accessories alone . Before you do this , however , you must first understand and be in complete sympathy with the decoration of your home . Armed with this fine understanding you should be able to acquire clocks and whatnots with unerring good judgment . After all , there is a limit to the number of possible types of design , shapes and color in decorative art . If your furniture is small in scale and delicate in design you wo n't want to use massive accessories with it . Nor will you use delicate lamps and knickknacks with massive furniture . This much you probably know . Carrying the idea further , you should soon be able to recognize the essential character of the design of the things you live with . Certain motifs that we think of as Chinese are recurrent in occidental art forms of all periods . If you recognize this affinity , you instinctively know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to change your pieces occasionally . The Japanese keep their works of art in concealment with but one or two on display . When they become bored with these they merely take new ones from storage and put them on display . Thus their homes can be endlessly exciting and fresh , and their pieces never become tiresome because of constant use , as many of our furnishings do . Go ahead and buy accessories if you will , begin collecting for the joy of possession , but do n't try to have everything you own in sight simultaneously . Display a few pieces at a time , then change them in rotation . If you do this your  | rooms will be a source of constant interest and freshness . When you select pottery , glass and silver for your dining room , study your manner of living and entertaining . This should govern your selection . Have at least three china and glass services . Select a gay and simple service for breakfast , go completely feminine in choosing the luncheon china , and for evening meals try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do it to the nines . Use all of your imagination in working up ideas for centerpieces . There is nothing much duller than a few sickly pink roses or a mound of artificial fruit in the middle of the table . Here , for instance , is a grand opportunity to exercise that old Japanese custom of switching accessories every so often . Pottery can be defined as any clay article fired in a kiln . Naturally this covers a broad range both as to type and use . Some pottery is primarily designed for utility and some for sheer decoration . Most of it is glazed but at the same time a great deal of it depends entirely on the natural coloring of the clay and the sheer beauty of the object 's shape . From the earliest times each country has had its pottery making techniques and designs . Museum and private collections house ancient Egyptian , Cretan , Greek and Chinese pieces of such extraordinary beauty that they still serve as inspiration to the designers of our own time . As manufacturing techniques improved , new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the time of the Renaissance we are able to trace the development of the  | potter 's art . Even today we reproduce objects made in the fifteenth century by Luca della Robbia . There are three basic types of pottery ? earthenware , stoneware and porcelain . Each naturally has subdivisions but they are merely variants of these three types . Earthenware , really a soft pottery , is probably the oldest and also the most universal type . The so-called biscuit form is a type which , after the first firing , can be used for none other than ornamental purposes . Biscuit pottery can be readily recognized since it is either tan or terra cotta in color and dull in finish . The biscuit , after the first firing , can then have a scratched or painted design which may be glazed by additional firing . Southwestern Indian work , French cooking utensils , Mexican ware and a great deal of Pennsylvania Dutch tableware are currently prized examples of earthenware . It has a tendency to chip and break . Stoneware , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is available in both dull and glazed forms and may also be either white or colored . Although some fine decorative objects are made of it , it is usually used for pickle and preserve jars . Porcelain is the aristocrat of the potter 's wheel , but even it is subdivided into types . The best porcelain , called " hard-paste , " is made of kaolin , which was used in China long before it was discovered in England about the middle of the eighteenth century . Before this the only type of fine pottery made in Europe was " softpaste , " which is really an imitation porcelain . While it is more translucent , it is not as white in color nor does it have the clear ringing tone of true porcelain . During the nineteenth century bone ash was added to the kaolin mixture . This is known as " bone porcelain " and is some- where between " soft-paste " and " hard-paste " in whiteness and tone . The Chinese were unquestionably the world 's greatest potters . From as early as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ch'ing , they made discoveries and invented techniques that influenced all the later great European work . During the Ming period , Chinese ware was first introduced into Europe , and it was at this time that the name " china " was given to porcelain . This ware was avidly collected and soon served as models for English and French factories . Not only were shapes copied , but so , too , were the colors and painted designs . During the Ch'ing period the colors were first produced that exerted such influence on French pottery that they are given French names . These are famille noire ( black ) , famille verte ( deep green ) , famille rose ( rose ) , famille jaune ( yellow ) , and sange de boeuf ( oxblood ) . European decorative pottery that is still exercising an influence on the decoration of today dates back to the twelfth century when the Moors introduced so-called majolica ware into Spain . It was heavy earthenware usually decorated with crude patterns in green-blue , yellow , white and lustreware . The latter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . Majolica was later introduced into Italy during the beginning of the Renaissance . It was developed there to a marked degree . The painted designs become ex ? tremely elaborate and were as a rule beautifully painted . Present-day Italian peasant pottery is treated in a crude variation of these originals . Delft is another important name in early European  | pottery making . It is named for a city in Holland which produced a fine quality pottery for both ornamental and table purposes . Its brilliant underglazed designs were greatly admired in England during the reign of Queen Anne , and many fireplaces during the early Georgian period were faced with Delft tiles . Great French potteries were first produced during the sixteenth century by Bernard Palissy , a man of tremendous talent . He developed a beautiful enamel which he used for work that resembles Italian majolica . During the reign of Louis XV , a porcelain factory was established at Sevres . It produced some of the most beautiful French work . In the beginning all Sevres pottery was made of soft-paste until in 1786 hard-paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tableware and objets d'art . Sevres is distinguished by beautiful modeling and painting in gold and color on a rose , blue , turquoise or apple-green ground . Germany was the first country in Europe to produce kaolin ware in the manner of Chinese porcelain . It was produced at Meissen near Dresden and has come to be known as Dresden ware . Although it is exquisitely beautiful , most of the designs are based on French originals . Ever since the seventeenth century when slip , a method of covering earthenware with successive coats of a liquid mixture of clay and water , glazing , and then scratching a design through the slip , England has been an important pottery producing country . Later the English began to produce a coarse imitation of Delft . Later imitations of Chinese ware were made . After the discovery of kaolin in Cornwall , the English pottery in- industry came into its own and from that time on most English work took its name from the town in which it was produced . Bristol produced imitation Delft for a long period . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve years later , this factory was discontinued . Bristol ware is very hard , quite white and often decorated in the Chinese manner . Bow was always a porcelain factory . Most of the design was Chinese in character . Bow eventually became part of the Derby factory . Chelsea was also ultimately to be absorbed by Derby potters . Started by French owners and workmen , the Chelsea factory is alleged to have produced the first porcelain ( soft-paste ) in England . The earliest work was heavily ornamented in the French style . Later the work developed Chinese characteristics . Derby is especially famous for fine figurines and other ornamental work , particularly in biscuit ware . Most of the tableware produced at this factory was decorated in the Japanese style . Lowestoft is one of the most famous names in English porcelain history . Most of the production was imitation porcelain and the decoration was copied from Chinese originals . Worcester is another important name . The production was of a rather high standard and a great deal of decors ? tion was done by transferring engraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name Royal Worcester was adopted because of a visit George III made to the factory . Staffordshire is in the best clay territory of England Not only is it plentiful , but there are a great many varied .  | ties and colors . Consequently there were a great many small potters who did and still do their work at home kilns . The standard of workmanship is quite high , although in some cases the designs are crude . Most good Staffordshire bears the individual potter 's name . Greatest of these are Enoch Wood , Poole , Lakin , Voyez Nealeolo , Wood and Caldwell , Thomas Whieldon , Thomas Astbury , Robert Garner and Josiah Spode . The latter is especially well known for his lustreware . Josiah Wedgwood was for a time the partner of Thomas Whieldon . Wedgwood , a man of extraordinary energy and taste , established his factory , which he called " Etruria , " in 1769 . Most of Wedgwood 's products were purely ornamental and all were executed in the classical manner popularized by Robert and James Adam . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These were colored black , lilac , sage-green , olive-green or in one of his two famous blues . The ornament was usually white . Other Wedgwood products were " Basalt , " a dull black ware , terra-cotta ware , agate ware and the beautiful cream-colored Queen 's ware . Most early American pottery is rather crude . Some of the most interesting work was made in Eastern Pennsylvania by German potters . Known as sgraffito ware , it was all made by the slip process in green , pink or blue on a red , brown or cream ground . Late in the Nineteenth Century , trained potters came to America from England . The best known of these was Daniel Greatbach , who came to America in 1839 . He influenced the mottled Rockingham ware which was produced in Bennington , Vermont . Today we can buy most of the great pottery types in reproduction of various kinds . Spode and Wedgwood  | are of course still being made and beautifully made , too , in the traditional manner . Besides this , there is commercially available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is made in smaller factories in almost every part of the world , including our own country . Especially notable pottery of today is made at the Royal Copenhagen factory in Denmark and by Ginori in Italy . Other fine modern work comes from France and the Scandinavian countries . Glassmaking is another ancient art , the beginning of which is steeped in legend . Whether it was first discovered by the Phoenicians is not so important as the fact that it was probably discovered by the accident of the heat of a camp fire fusing sand and lime , or sand and oxide of lead , into a crude glass . At any rate , glass has been made for a long time but was not generally owned and used until the eighteenth century . Before that time , it could be made only in small quantities and sizes , and for this reason was available only to the wealthy . Today it is so commonplace that those who are fond of trick nomenclature have called our era the age of glass . Glass is made by adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand or silica . This is then heated in a kiln to form a soft mass which can then be blown by hand without a mold , blown into a mold , or pressed . The best tableware has a base of red lead and potash . This is the type of glass that has a clear ring . Lime glass has a tendency to be brittle and consequently is not used for thin shapes . Although we think of glass as a colorless , transparent  | material , it may be had in both translucent and colored forms . Glass is colored and made translucent by the use of various metallic oxides fused into the original mixture . The most famous old glass is , of course , Venetian . Ever since medieval times , Venice has been famous for its delicate and beautiful work . Usually elaborate in design , it is so fine that instead of cutting the exquisitely wrought shapes , the modeling on them is always worked by the glass blower . Oftentimes Venetian glass is enameled or gilded . German and Bohemian glass is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used for such ceremonial utilitarian objects as flasks , beakers and wine glasses . Irish glass is usually called Waterford . It is generally a clear color , very hard and ornamented with cut designs . It was widely used for tableware and incredibly beautiful chandeliers and wall brackets . English glass is especially known for its intricate colored designs . The best was made at Bristol . America has from comparatively early times been noted for its fine glass . Among the best was that made by William introduced flint glass in both clear and colored forms . He also produced some etched glass . Jersey glass is another famous American type . It was usually heavy , crude and elaborate in shape . Midwestern glass , made in western Pennsylvania and Ohio , was an imitation of Stiegel 's work . Sandwich glass is the most famous of all pressed glass . During the nineteenth century it was made in considerable quantities in Massachusetts . It is practical and still  | available even to the antique collector of modest means .

Among the best of these is the work of Rene Lalique , a French designer who devised the much copied method of polishing the surface of pressed designs and leaving the body dull . Orrefors glass , made in Sweden , and Corning , made in America , are noted for beautiful design and engraving on crystal-clear surfaces . There are two distinct types of silver work . One is purely ornamental while the other is used for tableware . Manufacturers today usually try to co-ordinate the design of various table vessels , such as gravy boats and platters , with the flatware . This has been done ostensibly to make the selection of a pattern less of a problem , but at the same time , there is no hard-and-fast rule requiring all your tableware to be in one pattern . If you like to be governed by tradition , you will probably do what our ancestors did , combining pieces of silver that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different silver patterns , provided of course that they are designed more or less in the same tradition , seem to make table decoration a little less static than the fixed motif of one pattern . The type of silver design that appeals to us is based on Georgian English or Colonial precedent . English silver closely followed current English styles of furni- ture . The best American silver work was done in New York and Boston . Cornelius Kierstead worked in New York , and John Coney and Paul Revere are the best known of the Boston silversmiths . Pewter is a lead alloy that was used for exactly the same things that silver was used for , but it was very much cheaper . Today antique pewter is avidly collected and good reproductions are made of old pieces . Pewter ages well and old pieces should be cleaned carefully so that the fine patina is not lost . Whenever we think of copper and brass we are inclined to do so in terms of fireplace and door hardware . While these are important in giving a room life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any means limited to hardware . Since early times copper and brass have been used for lighting fixtures and many small utilitarian objects , such as jugs , drinking vessels and small ornaments . Recently modern design has revived an interest in these metals for many striking decorative effects . Wrought iron is one of the oldest decorative metals , but because of its heavy dark color and weight it is primarily suitable for door and fireplace hardware in Colonial or peasant interiors .  | Aluminum is essentially a modern material . Incredibly light in weight and fine in color , it is best used in a modern interior . It is frequently used for furniture making and as an architectural accent . Spun aluminum is also used for small , simply shaped objects , such as ash trays , cigarette boxes , pitchers and drinking vessels . Plaster ornament has recently undergone a revival . Widely used during the Georgian and rococo periods , it always functioned as a substitute for more precious materials . The current fad for elaborate plaster furniture and lighting fixtures , while amusing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material . Both these materials have been widely used for decorative accessories for hundreds of years . Tooled-leather objects are of course well known for desk sets , upholstering , and so on . The method of working metallic designs into fine kidskin is originally an Oriental art that was introduced into Italy , and later into France and England , where it was widely used for desk tops and small , flat decorative objects . Since modern designers seem to regard everything that smacks of practicality as grist for their mill , they have naturally looked upon leather with considerable favor . In contemporary decoration it is extremely successful as a veneer for furniture , for draperies , upholstering , for cigarette boxes , lamps and lampshades , and is highly effective as a wall covering .  | IMany metals are used in decoration . The bronze vase is Chinese of the T'ang dynasty , the wrought iron hinge is Pennsylvania German , the pewter chalice is Georgian Frig ? lish , steel was used to make this English Regency chair , the American andiron is of bell metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal alloys.  | Not only are its uses many , but so are its forms . Japanese shark , snake skin , pigskin and unsheared calfskin all give an exotic air to the modern room . We think of wood accessories as somewhat crude and provincial . While a good many of the earlier wood accessories are certainly crude , as are their reproductions , there are a great number of extremely sophisticated objects , both old and new , that employ various types of semi-precious woods . From early times all sorts of household implements were carved from wood . The early Colonists made constant use of wood for a wide variety of such implements and the tradition continued even after other materials were available . Many of these articles are beautiful in shape and some are nicely carved in a simple country style . Old chopping bowls , butter markers and other functional objects are much in demand by collectors . Many of the finer wood accessories made by exceedingly skilled craftsmen during the past are today considered works of art . They were invariably made of the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes the wood was decorated with paint , sometimes delicate intarsia of other woods was used , and occasionally metal and tortoise shell were applied as an inlay . All sorts of things were made of wood ? clocks , knifeboxes , wastepaper containers , desk sets , handles for knives and forks , small cabinets and a host of small accessories , some utilitarian and some sheer fantasy . During the past few years flower arrangement as a serious study has exerted a beneficent influence on the Ameri- can home . Formal Japanese flower arrangements with their moribana , nageirebana and similar fascinating and exotic names have been studied by thousands of women . Unfortunately , there is a definite danger in this . The tendency is to think of flower arrangement in terms of flower arrangement alone and not in terms of what flower arrangement means to the home . This field is an extremely varied one . So much so that it would require several books to cover the subject thoroughly . Although form and color are practically one in flower arrangement , form is somewhat more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , you can make a beautiful picture in black and white , but you can never achieve a beautiful picture unless it is good in design . Two things determine the form of a flower arrangement . One is the nature of the flowers themselves , and the other is the place of the arrangement in the room . There are but few basic arrangements . One is the triangle , another the square , the third a circle with possibly an S-curve running through it , the fourth is a radiating design coming from one center , the fifth is Lshaped , and the last is a tall , thin arrangement , which also has its variations . Think of your arrangement as bounded by an imaginary frame . This may consist of a pair of candlesticks , a mantel or a window . Before you start work on your arrangement , think of the flowers that are available in relation to these architectural elements , and , furthermore , think of the arrangement as something that is going to enhance them . You can use both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers themselves to compensate for any uninteresting features of your decorative scheme ,  | Flowers should be arranged with a definite shape in mind . A round arrangement based on the Hogarth S line of beauty , a triangular arrangement , flowers arranged in a square and a simple , high and graceful composition .  | Remember this , and you should never be worried about how your home looks , because , after all , flowers are available to everyone . In selecting flowers to use as decoration , remember that you must do this with the same sense of appropriateness that you exercise in selecting other decorative objects . The rare orchid has no place in the rustic interior , nor do straw flowers belong in a formal drawing room . There are certain places in the home where flower grouping is especially appropriate . Entrance halls , for example , because they are sparsely furnished , benefit greatly by colorful posies charmingly arranged in a handsome container . It is usually best to use a vertical arrangement in the foyer , since any low or small bouquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have . Be sure that your flowers are arranged in a definite pattern so that the foliage contributes to the design . Try also to place one flower so that it is never directly above another one . It is much more effective to space them at intervals . In arranging flowers in the living room , select them so that they really contribute to the color scheme , either by picking up tones that are already in the room , or by adding colors that the room may need to give it that extra lift . Here again the flower arrangement should be an important one . There are three logical points of the room for flower groupings . One is the mantel , another is in a large window , and an other is in high glass vases flanking an important sofa . Flower arrangements for the dining-room table should , as a general rule , be low so that they do n't interfere with conversation and do not detract from the general charm of the table setting . Even the flowers on the sideboard  | should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coloring . Arrangements for bedrooms should be entirely feminine in character both as to color and form . Old fashioned bouquets are entirely suited for this .
