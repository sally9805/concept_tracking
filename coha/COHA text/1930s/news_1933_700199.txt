txt Recovery Developments . Five mid-Western Governors worked ' out a farm price-raising program with the President . Secretary Ickes allotted $135,000,000 for buying by railroads to stimulate industry . General Johnson , holding the Swope plan an " ultimate ideal , " said that the NRA would continue the functioning of its " balanced organization " for industrial control . Objecting to scope of the " superorganization " proposed by Mr. Swope to govern industry , the National Association of Manufactur ens insisted upon retaining its autonomy while cooperating in the administration of codes . Confer at White House . Special to Tzrg wry : YORIC TIMES . WASHINGTON , Nov. 2 . ? Governors of five Western States . worked out with President Roosevelt today a tentative plan for price-fixing on wheat , corn , rye and other products to improve the situation among the farmers . The conference , after drafting a program suitable to the Governors , will meet again tomorrow morning , when the participants hope to see the adoption of a final plan . President Roosevelt was represented by the Governors as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to submit a detailed plan to which all could agree at tomorrow 's conference . This would force up farm prices to a parity with industrial prices . The plan was said to call for a processing tax which would fix the price of wheat at $1.03 and corn at 75 cents , with other prices of farm products in proportion . It was asserted at the conference that on the basis of 1926 prices , fixed at 100 , the farmer 's price for what he now buys is at the index of 116 and what he sells at 59 . Demands first presented to the President at the , meeting , which ran more than three hours , called for the fixing of prices at Chicago for basic farm commodities as follows : Wheat , $1.39 a bushel . Corn , 94 cents . Rye , 99 cents . Barley , 79 cents . Oats , 50 cents . Flax , $2.71 . Hogs , 11.32 cents a pound . Beef cattle , 10.99 cents a pound . Butter fat , 56 cents a pound . Eggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound . Turkeys , 34 cents a pound . Sugar beets , $8.91 a ton . Prices Would Allow Profit . These prices are based on cost of production , plus a margin of profit to the farmer , and the plan is similar to that proposed to Congress last Spring by John Simpson of Oklahoma , president of the Farmers Union . The level Is considerably above that of pre-war parity ? the goal sought in the administration 's farm relief program . The Governors who came here to urge further relief for farmers as the result of demands formulated at a conference at Des Moines were Schmedeman of Wisconsin , Olson of ' Minnesota , Herring of Iowa , Berry of South Dakota and Langer of North Dakota . After calling on Secretary Wallace and Henry Morgenthau , Governor of the Farm Credit Administration , they went to the White House and discussed their problems in detail with the President . Attending this conference were Secretary Wallace , George N. Peek , Farm Administrator , and Hamr L. Hopkins , Relief Administrator . The Governors insisted that the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising of the prices of their commodities by the government . Secretary Wallace was represented as opposed to entering upon such a program in face of the still incomplete processing tax plan . Mr. Peek was favorable to price fixing , but opposed the voices suggested by the visiting Governors . The Governors refused to compromise on anything short of price fixing , it was said , but some of them believed that their original figures might be pared down after fuller consideration . After the Governors had left the White House they met alone to discuss the situation . After conferring with Secretary Wallace they adjourned to the Cabinet room and deliberated for two hours . White House Statement . This statement was then issued by the White House : " The Governors of Iowa , Wisconsin , Minnesota , North and South Dakota met today with the President , Secretary Wallace , George Peek , AAA Administrator ; Henry Morgenthau Jr. , governor of the Farm Credit Administration , and Harry Hopkins , Federal Relief Administrator . " A tentative plan was worked out . Further conferences will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final plan then will be agreed upon . This plan when completed will be presented to the President forohis approval . " While the White House conference was in progress this message from Leo Crowley , chairman of the Governors Executive Council of Wisconsin , was delivered to the President : " When I returned last night to Madison from Des Moines the situation in the State , particularly the northern part , was terrible . Roads and all avenues to our cities were shut off . They are blowing up cheese plants and milk plants , and are getting ugly . I question whether we could stop it even if we call out the militia . " No clear-cut plan for enforcing higher prices has been worked out by the protesting Governors . Administration experts who have been studying the problem have considered the creation of a governrnent corporation to buy up surpluses so as to sustain prices . Several methods were considered in recent conferences with millers on a marketing agreement . In view of reports of the bootlegging of flour to avoid the processing tax and NRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is regarded as not easy of solution . In addition to asking for fixing of prices , the Governors are demanding that the interest rates on Federal Land Bank loans be reduced to 3 per cent . Governor Herring , before seeing the President , said : " We need immediate increases in the price level . It does n't matter much , how it is done . One of the most important things , we feel , is the adoption of a code which we will present to the President . If prices can be brought up to a fair level , other matters will take care of themselves . " Governor Herring added that the Farm Mortgage Relief Act passed at the last session of Congress had proved " inadequate . " SUMMARY OF FARM PLAN . The proposed farmers ' code submitted by the Governors , after the customary preamble as to general purposes and definition of terms , contains the following provisions : Participants may include bona fide farmers ; non-resident owners ; mortgage holders ; non-resident operators acting in a supervisory capacity ; " those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , service , organization or education within the industry itself , " and bona fide organizations of farmers and their officers and representatives . Administration of the code shall be limited to nine individuals elected within the industry , not less than seven of the nine to be elected by bona fide working farmers . Farm laborers shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing , and there shall be no discrimination based on membership or non-membership in any union . Accompanying this provision is the sort of " merit clause " thrown out of all codes since that for the automobile industry . Hour Limit Is 238 a Month . Maximum hours of labor shall be 238 hours a month , with the added provision that no laborer shall work more than ten hours in one day except in emergencies beyond the control of the employer . Minimum wage scales were indicated but were left to be fixed later , on a sectional basis , with board , lodging and laundry included as wages paid . The American Federation of Labor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be employed , but the age limit was left to be set later . One section reads : " The agricultural industry pledges that no action shall be initiated or supported within its control for the arbitrary disturbance of restriction of production without due respect to the well-being of the great human family of consumers , whose - safety in the essentials of life depends upon the adequacy of the supply of agricultural commodities . " There has never been a sustained overproduction or surplus ? no such condition shall be created by the agricultural industry . " Selling below the average cost of production is designated as an unfair method of competition . The average production cost would be determined and published from time to time , but not be changed oftener than once a year . Provisions for Surplus . The price of that portion of each crop necessary for domestic consumption shall be " regulated " according to the average cost of production plus a profit . The annual surplus shall either be stored on the farm or turned into export channels at world prices . The President shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the code . Provision is made for regulation of trade practices and for modification or cancellation of the code " to conform to any act of the President under the National Industrial Recovery Act . " The code concludes with this statement : " The agricultural industry has been victimized through the setting up of fictitious farm organizations , sponsored and supported by ambitious bureaucrats affiliated with the Federal Government or the chambers of commerce , by which the agricultural industry has been driven into a condition of blind , unchecked cut-throat competition in production to the utter neglect of a controlled sales system . " Farmers have been urged and in instances driven into commodity or , project groups , fighting each other instead of cooperating for mutual benefit . Having these conditions in mind , the agricultural industry declares itself opposed to such interference and tutelage . " The stationing or quartering of governmental , State or college agents on the industry , directly or through subterfuge , will be viewed as an overt act against the best interestsof the agricultural industry , "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
