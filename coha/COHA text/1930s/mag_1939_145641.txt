Each year , in his report for the Foundation , he offers fresh facts to prove his point . Last year he took colleges to task for buying tuba players with scholarships ( TIME , Feb. 14 , 1938 ) . Last week Dr. Jessup led off the Foundation 's 33rd annual report by giving the rough side of his tongue to another growing evil : tramp scholars . <P> " The medieval age , " said he , " had its wandering scholar . We have our itinerant or fleeting scholar . Hundreds of thousands of these itinerant students move from college to college , each armed with his letter of credit .

Although it is commonly supposed that the typical college student enters as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years later , actually today most students transfer or drop out before commencement day . Only one-third receive degrees in the college in which they started . <P> <P> *Dr . Jessup was recently elected to a unique position , given a seat on Johns-Manville Corp . ' s board of directors to represent the public .
