txt The resignation of Mr. ALEXANDER LEGGE , chairman of the Farm Board , which has been in the hands of the President for some time , was accepted by him yesterday . This ends for Mr. LEGGE an experience which he can hardly regard as " a pleasant souvenir , " as BISMARCK consoled , or alarmed , Prince ALEXANDER by telling him that his brief occupation of the throne of Bulgaria would be that . It was the hardczt of jobs which Mr. LEGGE found that he had been appointed to do , and in the end it proved quite impossible for him or any other man . He took the office reluctantly , and intimated from the first that he could not stay in it long ; so it can not be said that he is running away despairingly from difficulties which have overwhelmed him . So long as he served with the Farm Board he has been frank , even blunt , in dealing with farmers and their spokesmen ; has not tried to crowd his picture of agriculture with rosy colors ; has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government has suffered in the course of its operations in buying , or authorizing a subsidiary corporation to buy , wheat and cotton . The original theory of the functions of ' the Farm Board , as defined by President HOOVER , was never to put the Government into the agricultural business , and never to attempt to fix prices . Both things have been done under pressure . The Farm Board has become , in effect , the greatest dealer in grain that this country ever had , and did , by bidding up wheat , fix prices considerably higher than the world level , with the result of really fixing prices against the Treasury of the United States , piling up an enormous amount of wheat on which enormous losses will have to be taken . We are not blaming Chairman LEGGE for this . He was forced into it all little by little . But he must be glad to drop this kind of . irregular trading with Government money , with the Treasury all the while standing behind like a benevolent , uncle ready to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a private company that keeps books , takes account of overhead , charges off depreciation , economizes when it has to , and never tries to do three impossible things before breakfast . If the Farm Board chose to criticize other departments of the Government , it could make out a strong case of lack of coordination . While it has been trying to restrict acreage and keep down production so as to avoid an unsalable surplus , other Government agencies have been trying to persuade the farmer to raise larger crops by intensive cultivation , and still others have been making immense plans for bringing vast new areas of farm land into yielding . This contradiction has long been apparent to even a casual observer , and seems to have struck home to many actual " dirt farmers . " One of them writes pointedly in the last number of The Nation about the way in which he and his fellows have been pulled in opposite directions by different Government departments , so that they have been left much worse off than they would have been had Washington not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deliberate judgment , formed after years of experience on the farm , the very best form of governmental relief for farmers would be to relieve them absolutely of any more governmental interference .
