IT WAS our plan to get the ten big industries  --  those comprising the bulk of employment  --  in first . For this I had extended myself for weeks before the Act was passed by such conferences and conversations as I have related . These were Textiles , Coal , Petroleum , Iron and Steel , Automobiles , Lumber , the Garment Trades , Wholesale Trade , Retail Trade , and Construction . The latter four were too complex for immediate action , but the former six would accomplish our first purpose . Things were not going too well in any of them . The condition in Bituminous Coal has already been described . Something was holding back the Steel Code , which I had expected to have almost as soon as the Textile Code . Lumber was ready with a Code , but it asked too much . The petroleum industry was a discouraged and disorganized mob . In automobiles , the sticking point was the fact that Henry Ford was not a member of the Automobile Chamber of Commerce , and they were apprehensive about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite policy . There , at least , was one tangible on which I believed I could act . A Secret Trip to Detroit I HAD not been my first contact with the Fords. 1 During the war , when I took over the job as Chief of Army Purchase and Supply on the General Staff , I felt the need of someone in industry who understood production , and my thoughts turned at once to the Ford Company . I telephoned Mr. Ford 's office , and on the very next train he sent me the cream of his organization : Mr. Wills and Mr. Hawkins  --  foremost in popular estimation of the type of men I wanted . Throughout the war this had been his attitude , despite the fact that he detested war as an institution  --  wholly helpful , instantly responsive . There had also been one of those unfortunate developments of the draft : a claim of exemption made by Henry Ford for his son Edsel as indispensable to industry had been denied by the Detroit District Board under James Couzens , and appealed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's docket , but the welkin was ringing with popular protests . Under the new questionnaire system , all appealed cases went back for reclassification . Edsel was then placed in Class 1 ? fully available for service . But Class 1 had a subclass  --  father of a child  --  which was not to be called until those without children were taken . At just about that time Edsel became a father . It was a cruel thing that people should have criticized that boy . He had nothing whatever to do with the outcome . He had never made a claim of exemption for himself , and the application to him of the new rule was perfectly fortuitous . I wrote that rule , and I certainly could have known nothing of the forthcoming happy event .. Although it was a very unpopular thing to do , I proceeded to say so with all the force of which I was capable . My admiration for both the elder and the younger Ford has always been unstinted ; indeed , Mr. Ford had established the principles of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , years before the depression . On all these considerations , I thought a visit to the old gentleman might aid me in breaking the jam in the Automobile Code , and yet I did n't want anybody to know that I was making it . So one evening , after office hours , I took a fast Army airplane , arrived in Dearborn before dark , spent the evening with Mr. Ford , left early the next morning , and was in my office before it opened . Nobody but the principals knew about that trip for weeks afterward . I must somehow have misunderstood him , but I thought that he said that he would support what I was doing to the limit and even beyond . Representatives of his company sat in with the United States Automobile Chamber of Commerce during the formation of the Code and right up to the moment of its completion , and then , at the last moment , they suddenly withdrew . That . threw both the automobile camp and mine into complete consternation . I did not know what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and again flew to Detroit . I found Edsel in a state of great concern . He told me that they would sign the Code at once , if I would assure them that they would not have to bargain collectively with representatives of their men . Of course , I could not do that . An article in a magazine said I once offered to omit collective bargaining and that again Madam Secretary intervened . That would have been unlawful , was never even discussed , and again Madam Secretary had nothing whatever to do with it . Edsel said that his father was ill and running a high temperature and hoped that no immediate decision need be made . But I could no longer delay the Code . It was submitted without Mr. Ford 's signature . The " Cracking Dowd on Ford " Story N OW , it is not necessary for any member of an industry to sign a Code for his industry which the substantial majority thereof has proposed and approved . If he violates it , ? he violates the law , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate of compliance . No authenticated case of violation had ever been proved against the Ford Motor Company , and yet it has become a shibboleth to say that I threatened to " crack down " on Henry Ford . That came from a news hawk who is a friend of mine , who , I veritably believe , would not consciously do me an injury . Yet he did do the whole recovery program a vast , intangible injury by suggesting that we were going around the country cracking down on all and sundry . Here is a verbatim report of the colloquy on the cracking-down process , taken from the stenographic transcript of the press conference in which it occurred : Q. : General , how long will Ford have before you take stops ? A. : I do not know . Q. : Before you crack down on him ? A. : I think maybe the American people will crack down on him when the Blue Eagle is in other cars and he does not have one . Q. : In other words , you will not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Certainly not . No violation has ever been proved against the Ford Motor Company , but neither have they ever had a Blue Eagle . It was a simple application of the law and regulations which I was sworn to enforce and indicates no animus at all against Mr. Ford . I have none . However , sooner or later he is almost bound to come up against the collective-bargaining provisions , and if he persists in his determination as expressed to me by Edsel , he will find himself athwart the law of the land . The final submission of the Automobile Code was made to me in Detroit . In that case I made such a slip as I suppose might be expected of anybody in such stress . The Code contained the famous merit clause . To my mind , it does n't mean anything . Nobody can agree to modify or amend a law or a statute . But the President was determined against even the appearance of doing so . I read this one hastily and said I would approve it . The Code was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inconsistent with this phase of the President 's policy , but I could not throw it out and keep my word . It is in there still . It has never raised a question of dispute , and it never will , because it is meaningless . But if I had it to do over again , it would not be there . The Code was approved with minor changes , and that was No. 2 of the big six we were after . In the meantime , threatening and misleading activities were being furiously pushed by both industry and labor , and it became necessary for the NRA to clarify its own position , which it did on July seventh , as follows : " Circulars and other literature purporting to come from labor-union agents have intimated or openly stated that it is a purpose of the National Recovery Act and Administration to unionize labor or that the only way labor can secure benefits under that Act is to join this or that Union . " Similar statements purporting to come from industrial concerns have intimated that this or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which labor can get a fair deal under this Act . Both statements are incorrect and such erroneous statements of the Act and its Administration tend to foment misunderstanding and discord . " It is the duty of this Administration to see that all labor  --  organized as well as unorganized  --  gets a square deal , and the Administration is organized to do and will do that duty . The improved labor conditions proposed in the textile industry , which is largely unorganized , are an example of this . It is not the duty of the Administration to act as an agent to unionize labor in any industry and , as has been repeatedly stated , it will not so act . It is the duty of this Administration to require the inclusion in codes of the mandatory conditions of Section 7 and see that these conditions are complied with , and it will perform that duty . " The policy of the National Recovery Administration respecting the rights and obligations of both organized and unorganized labor is based on the declaration of policy in Section 1 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation , in part as follows : " to induce and maintain united action of labor and management under adequate Governmental sanctions and supervision . " Manifestly , the purpose of the Act is to create and preserve harmonious relationships and to prevent industrial strife and class conflicts . " Labor in any industry has the right to organize and bargain collectively ; the law also recognizes the right of individual workers to bargain for their own conditions of employment . But in the execution of this new social policy to which the Government stands committed , it is the obligation of the National Recovery Administration to require the payment of living wages by industry as a condition of continued existence and to prevent excessive and unreasonable disparities , in the interest of both social justice and a balanced economy . " Collective bargaining under adequate Government sanction and supervision should hold no fears for the fair-minded industrialist ; on the other hand , the National Recovery Administration pledges itself through its Labor Advisory Board to obtain a fair deal for labor in any industry presenting a Code , whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function or the purpose of the Administration to organize either industry or labor . " The President 's Statement rr HE following is from the Presi-dent 's statement of policy of June sixteenth , which is and will remain the Magna Charts of this administration : " This Act is a challenge to industry , which has long insisted that , given the right to act in unison , it could do much for the general good which has hitherto been unlawful . From today it has that right . " This law is also a challenge to labor . Workers , too , are here given a new charter of rights long sought and hitherto denied . But they know that the first move expected by the Nation is a great co-operation of employers , by one single mass action to improve the cases of workers on a scale never attempted in any nation . Industries can do this only if they have the support of the whole public , and especially of their own workers . This is not a law to foment discord , and it will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual confidence and help , and we can safely rely on the sense of fair play among all Americans to assure every industry which now moves forward . prom ptly in this united drive against depression that its workers will be with it to a man . " If we ask our trade groups to do that which exposes their business as never before , to undermining by members who are unwilling to do their parts , we must guard those who play the game for the general good against those who may seek selfish gains from the unselfishness of others . We must protect them from the racketeers who invade organizations of both employers and workers . " In the meantime we were sitting up night and day with the warring elements of the bituminous-coal industry . I have often been accused of bulldozing the industrialists in that and other industries . Just try to do it ! There was hot talk in plenty  --  it was a hot summer . Take the shaping up of the Bituminous Coal Code . There were ultimatums  --  from one side to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackling oaths went to and from across the fist-banged board , " but , you do not get a dozen warring districts which have never known peace in our lifetime and the labor in all these districts together with one another and with their employers , to agree for the first time in history by suavity and ( Continued on Page 82 ) YEE MLUIE EZOILE PROX SGG W SAIRTffill ContInued from Pali* 19 ) slickness or by reading economic lectures by a professor . Outside of ngriculture , it is the most individualist group in this country , and all the gentle arts of suasion have for decades been tried and failed . On July twelfth I was able to an-nounce : " Word has reached me that Codes covering substantially all of the bituminous coal industry are nearing completion and will be submitted to the administration early next week . " In spite of reports to the contrary , the leaders of this great industry have been working night and day for weeks to effect a compromise of their differences , and I am particularly pleased with the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chieftains of Labor The hearing was set for August twenty-eighth . Shortly afterward , I was able to say : " Committees of the ' United Mine Workers and of the operators in the Appalachian bituminous field have reached the basis of an agreement covering the principal points at issue and which this administration is willing to recommend to the President . " The intervening time had been practically one continuous and unrelieved series of conferences , sometimes bitter , sometimes calm , but it is preferable to settle such vast affairs across a table , with no matter how much acrimony , than at 10,000 pit mouths with riot and bloodshed everywhere . A battle of words across a table is better than a battle of bullets across a barricade , especially when the spoils of victory are no greater in the latter case . Nobody will ever know what happened behind those closed doors to accomplish this result. , but I am proud to say that among the very best friends I gained in NRA are in this industry  --  John Lewis , whom I regard as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. D. Lewis and Henry Women , on the employees ' side ; J. D. A. Morrow , Charlie O'Neill , Charlie Francis and Jim Taggert , on the side of employers . They are chieftains in what had been for years the fiercest industrial labor battleground in the United States . Although John Lewis was ill when it became clear what was happening in NRA in September , 1934 , there came from his bed a grunt of indignation and a roar of defiance which , in one short page and a half , transcended all the 65,000 other letters and telegrams I received ? " If I had been there , this would never have happened , " and , believe me , it would n't have happened in just the way it did . Some Politics to Play Those who have relations with labor leaders and have some measure of understanding of their problems know that there is necessarily some politics there to play . Lack of experience with the true situation on my part was , in part , why I selected Mr. Richberg as counsel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would do it a little differently if I had it to do over . Politics there may be , but with these outstanding leaders , I have found that all they ask is a square deal and that they dislike polities as much as anybody . In spite of some buffets I have given , I doubt if anybody in this administration has any better friends in labor than I have among some of these men . I never aspired to championship of any conflicting interests . I aspired to impartiality . All that requires is justice and fair play . The Labor Department is by its very nature a " pressure bureau . " It is charged by statute with special advocacy of labor . I think that such a department should be confined to such advocacy . That very fact , to my mind , precludes its control of other governmental instrumentalities such as NRA or the labor tribunals . I doubt if there are any strong labor leaders who do not agree . In the autumn of 1033 , Mr. Rich-berg asked me to come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared I was getting an idea that he was trying to interfere in the control or direction of NRA . I was astonished . I had no reason to think any such thing . I liked him and trusted him completely . I told him so . But he had more on his mind . He said that he had friends who believed him to be available for appointment to a very high judicial post . The Perfect Set.Up He said that , of course , it was unethical to electioneer for such an honor , but that it would be advisable for him to be where the lightning might strike if it wanted to . He said that neither the public nor the President knew him very well and that he thought I could help him by taking him with me on visits to the President and referring important speaking dates , which I could not fill , to him . His point , he said , in telling me this was so that I might not mistake the pursuit of this design for any activity on his part to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . I promised to do and religiously did just what he asked . I lauded and boosted him on every occasion , and especially to the President . I pushed many important speaking dates his way , and never lost an opportunity to advance his cause . He never voiced a disagreement to me while he served on my staff . I recommended creation of the Industrial Emergency Committee and recommended him as its director . I also recommended him to take Frank Walker 's place in the National Emergency Council . I trusted him implicitly , was doing everything in my power to advance his interests . Indeed from his first appearance before the public as General Counsel to every position he now holds there is none to which I did not either appoint or recommend him . But I must keep to my narrative about the Codes . The Bituminous Coal Code was approved on September eighteenth , and that was the third of the Big Six industries we had striven so hard to capture . It was the toughest fight and the biggest accomplishment of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields and , generally , in what I have always regarded as the perfect industrial set-up  --  a whole industry organized under a Code , the whole of labor organized vertically alongside of it , a negotiated agreement betiveen the whole of industry and the whole of labor , a self-contained mechanism for the settlement of disputes without either strikes or lockouts , and a growing feeling of partnership and community of interest between management and labor throughout that Code and Industry . There was almost as much hostility between different coal fields Rich as Southern and Northern Appalachian as there was between labor and management in certain fields . Both the price and the wage structures of the industry were demoralized and both were rehabilitated by the Code . The industry will he " in the black " this year for the first normal period in many years . Putting together the entire mosaic as just related was the greatest single accomplishment of NRA and of the men I have mentioned . There were plenty of hold-over skirmishes of the main battle on the Coal Code , relating to captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , not selling coal to the public but producing it for manufacture of iron and steel . The claim was made that they were not under the Coal Code . Part of that fight I had to conduct from a hospital bed and the President himself had to intervene before it was over . There were a few strikes , but the whole thing was settled after some weeks of stubborn resistance . As to that particular claim , the President told the operators " pigs is pigs and coal is coal . " ? and so they finally went under the Code . But they fought at every step . I had an operation for a painful but not serious ailment and , much to the concern of Colonel Keller , Ward 8 of the Walter Reed Hospital became a hive of activity . He stopped at the door of my room one day when , after two hours with the principals of the American Iron and Steel Institute and two or three messages back and forth with the President , I said to Eugene Grace : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gene , and it will twist off and roll on the floor . " Mellon fished to Help Colonel Keller knew neither that Mr. Grace and I had been friends since the war nor the bantering language sometimes used in that particular group , and I think he expected the heavens to fall and engulf me . He raised his hands in despair and backed out of the room , A good deal went on behind the scenes in these early encounters . Once , in the coal imbroglio , I called up Andrew Mellon , whom I had never had the honor of meeting , and asked his help with the heads of some of his reluctant companies . It came instantly and effectively . Many times in the steel , coal and petroleum arguments , either through such friends as Gerard Swope and Walter Teagle or directly , if I happened to know the right person , we went . back to sources of financial control to bring pressure on heads of companies who were hanging back , and we almost always got it . To persuade the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest that we would put the whole naval-construction program into the navy yards . I did n't have any authority to say that , but it was necessary to say , and when I promptly reported it to the President , he laughed and backed it up instantly . The Lumber Code , too , came in during this period . I did not conduct these hearings . There was no epic fight in these negotiations , but , on the other hand and for the very reason that there was not sufficient controversy to develop the subject , the Code has never been so satisfactory as others of the Big Six . We have had to change it more than once , and I fear that it is still not right . The Retail Code came through much faster than we had expected . But the greatest problem of all was presented by the Petroleum Code . Can not and Must Not Petroleum is like no other product . It is stored , fully manufactured by natural processes which nobody understands , in great subterranean reservoirs . The adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole  --  usually six inches in diameter at the bottom , thousands of feet down  --  against nearly all the rest of the earth 's surface that there is one of those elusive reservoirs from 3000 to 10,000 feet below . If there is , the oil flows up in a gushing flood and has somehow to be disposed of . There is petroleum in many states , but the trouble all comes from California , Texas and , in lesser degree , Oklahoma . It can be stated very simply  --  too many reservoirs have been tapped . A man with a 30,000 barrel gusher in those flush fields regards the flow as absolutely his own , and there is strong common-law logic for his thought . But we are very far removed from the simplicity of Saxon England . This natural resource is limited and expendible . The scramble to dissipate it for expedient personal wealth may be good individual husbandry , but it is hardly short of national lunacy . For years attempts have been made to regulate the flow to reasonable current requirements , with some regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Up until recently , the Federal Government had said to those who wanted to do this : " Under the Constitution we can not ; under the Sherman and Clayton Acts you must not . " But NIRA put a new face on this . It offered an opportunity for producticin control . The petroleum industry tried to get together to submit a Code . They could n't . They simply dropped apart in more than fifty warring groups . They had a convention in Chicago which resulted only in agreements to disagree , but the largest group did come to Washington with a Code . We opened public hearings and , behind the scenes , did a lot of missionary work which finally reduced the factions to about three . In the hearings we let . everybody blow off steam . Finally we called for small committees from each group on each of the three great segments of production , manufacture and distribution . Then we took these groups back to NRA , shut them up in rooms , each with an NRA representative , and told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the issue down to a single major disputed point  --  arbitrary price fixing or no . I was absolutely opposed to it . I knew that industry pretty well , because I came from Oklahoma and my whole family ( including ( Continual an Pose 84 ' ( Confinuod front Page 82 ) myself ) has been in this business since the first Mid-continent field opened . I thought that , if they would control production , price would take care of itself , and we would then need a maximum price to protect the public rather than a minimum price to protect the companies . Finally we worked out it hermaphroditic compromise . I called the town meeting together again , gave them the Code that we had thus written and told them " that was it " ? that within twenty-four hours I would hear protests , but that , essentially , that was it . That was the nearest I ever came to meriting the frequently repeated charge of . " cracking down . " It was n't very near , because , with the exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceded to that Code . Although Harry Sinclair did say to me in argument on one point : " Oh , what 's the use ? You 'll write in what you want anyway . " The Three Great Battles As soon as NRA had made the Code it was turned over to Secretary Ickes to administer . There some revisions were made and the effective words of one clause were inadvertently omitted . In this sketchy account , it is impossible to convey the strain and time and effort that were expended in the three great battles  --  Bituminous Coal , Steel and Petroleum . As far as NRA was concerned , I felt that it was on trial for its life . Everything depended on success in these early major engagements . If , by lack of agreement , we were thrown into a maze of injunctions , mandamuses and the law 's delays , the whole bright hope of abolishing all the ancient iniquities against labor  --  sweat shops , child labor , employer domination , unstable wages and unlimited hours  --  the whole possible benefit to industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , to an extent , of the President 's program would be discredited , On the other hand , if we moved out to compel Codes , all of industry would fee ! that every worth-while thing that has characterized our institutions had gone by the board in a dictatorship far worse than that in any European country , including Russia . We simply had to succeed at the very jump-off . NRA did the job . It did it from one end of this country to the other , and it did it in a few months . I have never heard anybody suggest another formula on which it could have been done . Indeed , it was tried on another formula in several industries in another department of Government , and with a result of complete impasse . We did not favor industry and we did not favor labor . We have been criticized by partisans of both sides . It would be well for some of these people to reread the President 's statement of policy of June 16 , 1933. and the Act which he signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions with scrupulous accuracy , and it is my belief that by the policy and administration thus given to the law , NRA had done more for industry and for working people in this country , organized and unorganized , than all the labor organizations and all these critics during the entire term of their natural lives . Perhaps it would have been managed otherwise . It is possible that 7-A and the hours-and-wages provisions could have been rammed down the throat of industry by statutory or executive decree , as some people seem to wish . But I do n't believe it . If it had been attempted , it would have required the full force of the Federal power , judicial , military and executive , to do it. , and I might as well say here that , if it had been attempted in that fashion , I would have been on the other side of the argument . If I could have consulted my own convenience and wishes , I would have left NRA when the big Codes wore in and the President 's Re-employment Agreement had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did then attempt to resign . I did not press it because I could not then say that the organization of NRA was yet in shape for change . I wanted to get away again in March , 1934 , but the situation was still obscure . There is always a pulling and hauling around the desk of any chief executive in business or in government . It was so with Woodrow Wilson , to an extent which few imagine , and especially during the war . But he had a peculiar advantage . By that time his Cabinet had been in office four years and had settled down to fixed relationships . Except for the War and Navy Departments , all emergency administrations were outside the Cabinet . But above all , there were the cohering and compacting effects of war . He could delegate fixed responsibility and back it with plenary authority . When so much of agriculture as was organized and vocal demanded Herbert Hoover 's scalp , the President stood like a rock . When the Allied High Command and certain influences at home tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody in that administration tried to bring the President any scurrilous story about an associate , he was ostentatiously ignored . War and the circumstances of an established incumbency made things possible then which are not possible now . In those circumstances you can get men competent for such a bitter conflict to espouse public service , but it is not so in a peacetime crisis , when you have to try to change customs and viewpoints held for decades . That causes sniping , both in and out of Government . Spies swarm . Sometimes an official must subsist on his skill in avoiding , if not promoting , innuendo , or not subsist at all . In the midst of battle , with the enemy without , he must spend much of his time combat ing more insidious influences within his own ramparts . That is why it is difficult to get men of sufficient caliber to serve . You can persuade them to start . You ca n't persuade them to stay . And it is hard to do such a vast job in such an atmosphere or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during and after the war , but never have I seen it such a whispering gallery and never has it seemed so unkind . Everybody on Edge During the autumn days of 1933 , NRA organization was new , hastily thrown together , uninstructed , inexperienced and growing at the rate of 100 a day . For the first time in my life I was trying to operate with a staff and executives all of whom I did not know by their first names and of whose more or less intimate personal history I know nothing . Some of these I could not even recognize by sight . I have been through great physical and mental strain several times , but never more than at this particular period . I was getting about four hours ' sleep on an office sofa , and did not go home for days on end . Everybody 's nerves were jangled . I remember once ; Mr. Riehberg , who had been working himself to a wraith , came to me at the very heaviest of this load , to protest against having his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages and classification of employees . He said legal specialists , oven to typists , were different , and that he would resign if he had to be interfered with in that way . I think I answered tartly that every other department had so to comply . I did not intend to be tart , but he went out , with his shoulders heaving , and I did not . see him again for several days . Nerves were stretched so taut that there were several explosions . Even two-fisted Bill Allen once disappeared for two days in a huff . The Dudley Cates episode was nine-tenths overwork . Most astonishing of all , Alvin Brown once " went prima-donna on me " and I had to send two of the younger men away to prevent physical and nervous collapse . One man dropped dead in the coal negotiations . Earl Howard collapsed in a garment hearing . Several of my principal assistants had to leave because they simply could not stand the physical strain . When the Blue Eagle Flies Away The Cabinet board to which I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They even proposed at one time to take over the approval or modification of Codes upon which we had spent hundreds of hours of work and study , controversy and compromise , and about which they knew nothing whatever . Some of them started to admonish me because the pronoun " I " appeared in a bulletin , until I showed them that it was a direct quotation of a presidential utterance . Those were the happy days ! There have been both praise and blame of the Blue Eagle and our first drive to get every employer in the country under the Blue Eagle , either by a President 's Re-employment Agreement or a Code . In my opinion , it was not only right and expedient , but was urgent and so indispensable that I am prepared to risk the prophecy : When the Blue Eagle goes , NRA will go , and the sweat shop , child labor and unconscionable labor conditions will return except , perhaps , in a few very large and highly integrated and organized industries . No criticism has called more urgently for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called Blanket Code  --  PRA ? conception were hasty afterthoughts outside the statute , and that the Blue Eagle is unnecessary . I must make the answer to this ignorance , because if future administration goes on any such assumption , it is bound to fail . There was nothing new about the idea of the Blue Eagle . In the official report of the War Industries Board , Page 253 , dated March 3 , 1921 , referring to an occurrence of November , 1915 , appears the following : A system of pledges was required of manufacturers , jobbers and retailers . Retailers were required to exhibit a card explaining the particulars of the scheme in a particular place in their stores . Thus the Blue Eagle idea was proved necessary in another similar movement in which I had participated fifteen years before . It takes at least six weeks to put one of the great major Codes completely through the NRA mill from original negotiation to final approval . As we said publicly before the law was passed , the avalanche of Codes was foreshadowed by the announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our initial studies showed that there must be several times as many soon to come . A shorter method was needed at the outset to bridge the longer process of the Codes . The difference between a Code and a President 's Re-employment Agreement  --  miscalled the " Blanket Code " ? is that the former is a proposal for self-government by an entire industry or by a substantial majority . It presupposes en organized industry closely knit into a trade association integrated nationally or over a wide region . It looks toward industrial self-government within that industry by a Code Authority which shall net with a representative of the Government who , while attending its meetings and having access to what it does , observes , but does not participate  --  with one important exception : he can veto what the Code Authority does , on the ground that it violates the Code or the law , or is incompatible with the public interest . A Re-employment Agreement  --  PRAdiffers as follows : In a PRA , an individual or a firm separately engages with the President to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't agree with others of his craft , although all in that craft may separately agree with the President . There is no Code Authority . The rules are necessarily elementary and usually refer only to wages , hours and conditions of labor . A Presidential Agreement can be made in twenty-four hours with a minimum of argument and of subsequent administration . There were eight compelling reasons for the Blue Eagle and PRA . The first was simply that , unless something were done at once to close the gap to Code completion , the mere physical limitations on the process of Code manufacture would withhold the benefits of NRA indefinitely . Handicaps on Industry There is this peculiarity about the NRA principle : Not only do companies and localities compete with one another , partially for trade , completely for labor , but whole industries also so compete . For this reason , when a change like NRA comes along , raising wages , shortening hours and inevitably increasing costs , one company in an industry can not accept it unless practically all other companies in that industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one industry or one locality accept it unless all industries and all localities similarly situated accept it . One of the astonishing disclosures by the NRA hearings is the extent to which degraded labor conditions in one locality reach out through competition to degrade the conditions in another industry or locality , Thus the Birmingham cast-iron industrial group , especially in companies operating on extremely low labor rates for their Negro workmen , and even after paying heavy freight , were able to compete in the Detroit and Grand Rapids districts , many hundreds of miles away , leaving no recourse to salvation of the older northern branch of that industry except to degrade its own labor . To illustrate the same principle as between groups of an industry rather than localities : Somebody starts a sweat-shop operation in the metropolitan area  --  say , in the Connecticut Valley . His cheap goods begin to flood into New York . The legitimate manufacturer is confronted with a choice between following the same lead or going out of business . Exactly the same principle preserved child labor . Nearly all manufacturers wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their labor costs through employmentof children , barred the road of others to economic decency . In fact this , and this almost alone , is the fundamental principle of the successful quest for decent labor conditions in this country . To permit such marked inequality in labor costs is to ask the company , or the industry , or the locality which complies , to accept an unconscionable handicap in the struggle for economic existence . Regional Lines Important For these reasons it was necessary , in inaugurating NRA , to find some means to create a norm for labor conditions in all industry and all localities at about the same time . The Code process was too slow to do this , and that was the second essential reason for PRA and the Blue Eagle . By no means were all industries organized in trade associations . Only a few were  --  certainly not more than 20 per cent by industries or 10 per cent by establishments . Many of the 400 applying for Codes were not ready to receive them . A Code requires some kind of industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelling reason . The first reaction to the proposed New Deal , even before anybody knew exactly what it was going to he , was the vast speculative , anticipatory activity already described . The cotton-textile industry approximated 1929 rates of production . People who were not even in that business began to buy that product and store it away in warehouses . Prices were soaring far in advance of wages , employment and purchasing power . It was indispensable to do something to avert a new collapse and crash  --  a fourth inescapable reason for the Blue Eagle . We talk about interstate and intrastate commerce . As John Marshall once said : " In commerce we are one people , " and that was never more forcibly demonstrated than upon passage of the Recovery Aet . We were raising costs by increasing pay rolls . Intrastate commerce and industry compete with interstate commerce and industry . Unless we could find some rule to put them on the same basis of hours and wages , we would have been scarcely justified in doing anything at all , because intrastate operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and threatening that no man who lived through those anxious days will ever again be persuaded that there is any important enterprise in this country that is not  --  in the language of the Act ? " in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce . " We had an astonishing lesson , which it is vitally important that the whole country should understand . State lines are not the significant lines in American commerce . If there are any clear lines of demarcation , they are regional rather than state boundaries . The areas are economic rather than political . As has been explained , the general low wage scales in certain whole groups of states , and especially the wages of Negroes in some industries , had spread their effect like a great grease stein over large areas of the map of the United States , degrading wages and living conditions of labor in other regions far removed . S6 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 2 , F035 We had to devise a means of insuring some improvement by operators working physically intrastate , to protect interstate commerce from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predatory wage and price cutting , to the imminent threatened destruction of American living standards . It is a constant process of leveling , with no other direction than downward . 11 an individual voluntarily agrees with the President to pay standard wages for standard hours , in consideration of being allowed to display the Blue Eagle , statute or no statute , this difficulty has been abated , even though the only remedy for violations in intrastate commerce is removal of the Blue Eagle . This was a fifth controlling reason for the PRA and the Blue Eagle . The Ancestry of the Blue Eagle With a law affecting established practices of nation-wide extent , except in glaring , outstanding and important cases , you could uo more enforce it by relying on court process and criminal prosecution alone than you could enforce prohibition . To enforce it fully , we had to have an aroused , militant and almost unanimous opinion . To make it possible for such a public opinion to support those who were cooperating to create employment and purchasing power and to withhold support from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily recognizable , striking and effective . We designed the Blue Eagle for this purpose . That was the sixth reason for the Blue Eagle . The bird was at once attacked as being a foreign and cabalistic design . As a matter of fact , except for ' the lower part of him , he is about the oldest old artificial thing in America . He is the thunder bird  --  an Amerindian ideograph of unmeasured antiquity . Some evangelical commentators in the Tennessee hills said he was the Beast of the Apocalypse , and affected to prove it by counting the serrations of his wings . I immediately ran for Holy Writ , but I could not count that way . He was designed for visibility and uniqueness rather than as a speaking symbol  --  I sketched the idea on paper after talking with Henry Wallace about thunder birds , but the actual design was by Charles Coiner and was contributed . ? There was an immediate necessity for starting the whole of industry on codification . The President 's Reemployment Agreement provided for wages and hours on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries . Relief for them lay in submission of Codes and an accurate determination , after a public hearing , of what the exact rates should be . There was a sort of indirect persuasion in this situation . The Blue Eagle and PRA brought in all the Codes within a few months  --  that was the seventh reason . Finally  --  an eighth reason  --  as a proved principle of administration on a grand scale , it is much easier to lay down a general rule and then deal with the exceptions , than to attempt to deal with each case separately . The President 's Agreement laid down and applied the general rule and scared up the exceptions . Then the Code permitted us to deal with the exceptions . We should have failed on any other plan . These eight reasons for the Blue Eagle campaign are not now stated for the first time . They were echoed like a muezzin over the housetops from the very first . I have never heard any of them refuted in logic . I have heard only slogans , shibboleths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tom-toms on a war drum , until thoughtless people began to repeat them as reasoned conclusions . The Blue Eagle campaign  --  as soon as political and nonconformist opponents began to dare  --  was criticized on three principal grounds : that it was ballyhoo ; that it was a boycott and , later , that it promised more than it delivered . I want to answer the latter first , because that is simply a question of fact . Every statement I made in prophecy is in the public records  --  that I refused to prophesy , that my hope was to put 3,000,000 men to work under Title I. As soon as the Blue Eagle campaign was in effect , we took an actual questionnaire census of re-employment under the Blue Eagle , and it showed , roughly , 2,785 , - 000 , which happened to be within 2 or 3 per cent of Mr. Lubin 's re-employment figures , independently arrived at in the Department of Labor . The third criticism is simply a misstatement of fact . But as to " boycott " and " ballyhoo " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons or arguments  --  like calling religion a " fake . " A boycott is a consumers ' strike  --  sometimes political , like Chinese refusal to buy Japanese goods  --  sometimes economic , like the Buy British movement in England and many hundreds of Patronize Home Products campaigns in this country . It is a perfectly legitimate economic weapon , recognized and applied in the United States since and before we were a nation . What were the Boston Tea Party and colonial resistance to British importation but a boycott ? No ; " boycott " was an epithet . What these critics wanted to do was to paralyze NRA , for the sole reason that they did n't want to pay higher wages , grant shorter hours and abolish sweatshops and child labor . But they did not dare to say that , so they resorted to the chanting " Boycott , boycott , boycott , " like savage witch doctors around a fire in a war dance , where , having no argument , they incite murderous emotions by continuously repeating , " Hoo-i-yea , hoo-i-yea , hoo-iyea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting too far away from the primitive beginnings of the race to heed the rumblings of such distant drums . Political Sniping There was a political reason far deeper and more subtle than this . The Blue Eagle put the enforcement of this law into the hands of the whole people just as did the Selective Draft Plan , which Secretary Baker adopted as against military enforcement , and said that his reason was that if the people did n't support a war , a democracy could not wage a war . It was the exact antithesis , for example , of prohibition enforcement , where an army of Federal snoopers tried to impose on the people , through pains and penalties , a statute which most of them did not approve . The President hit the nail squarely on the head When he said : " There are adequate penalties in the law , but I am now asking for the co-operation that comes from opinion and conscience . These are the only instruments we shall use in the great summer campaign against unemployment . But we shall use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to make the plan succeed . " Recalcitrant employers did not like this , the Old Guard and the Old Dealers did not like this . There are many ways to control or avoid Federal enforcement by prosecution , but there is no way to avoid public opinion implemented by oven so mild a right as to buy where you choose and to decline to buy where you do not choose . All any seller had to do to get the President 's " shining badge " was to pay his employees a minimum of twelve or thirteen dollars a week for forty hours of labor and , as I had occasion to say at that time , " Men have died and worms have eaten them , but not from paying human labor thirty cents an hour . " From the crustacean political standpoint , it was simply too close to letting our people have some hand in their own affairs to suit their dear old predatory precedents , and that was and is all there was to the Hottentot howl of " boycott . " Carrying NRA to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barker does to get people to spend their money for tickets to a side show which is n't worth the money . It is the constant repetition of lies , incitements or exaggerations , and I was accused by nearly all of them of being the " biggest and most blatant ballyhoo artist in the whole New Deal . " It is true that I believed zealously and earnestly in what I was doing . When I had decided to take my job I said to Bernie Baruch , " Gee , Chief , I wish I had your faculty for getting things done through charm and astuteness and polish , and your genius for saying things very positively , but so gently that nobody ever takes offense . " Then he told me the story of Paul Berlenbach , who was a slugger of the Dempsey type before whom nobody could stand . " But then , " Bernie said , " somebody came along to teach him to box . He did n't last six months . Somebody with a wallop got in the ring with him and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they carried him through the ropes feet first . Go in there and be yourself and not Bernie Baruch , nor Jim Ham Lewis , nor Lord Chesterfield , nor anybody else but just yourself . " This I tried to do , and if sometimes the verbal result savored of a cavalry barrack , my only excuse is that I spent the formative period of my life in that environment . 1 talked as I had always talked , and in carefully rereading all of it , I still ca n't see the " ballyhoo . " Of course , the country had to be told about NRA . Some districts lagged and some forged ahead . Enemy propaganda was stronger in some places than in others . These were perilous moments . In spite of the work in Washington , which was so great that sometimes for days at a time  --  four hours out of twenty-four was all I could spare from work  --  it was absolutely necessary to go all over the United States to confer with local leaders and to make speeches  --  sometimes three a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help us  --  a big fast Condor plane with a desk in it . The speeches were written on hops from city to city . We visited every important town in the country except New Orleans , and flew a distance considerably greater than the earth 's circumference . Within a few weeks doubt about the first great step was over . This country was astir from coast to coast . Along the line of march were such men us stood on the banks of the Hudson while Fulton 's steamboat got up steam , and- cried , " She 'll never run ! She 'll never run ! " We also heard a similar complaint in Washington for a month . We liked to remember that when the Clermont began chunking up the Hudson River , men ran alongside crying : " She 'll never stop ! Shell never stop ! " We soon beard that also . " Beware ! What is the Government going to do with this dangerous weapon ? " Of course , a lot of people signed the Blue Eagle Agreement not knowing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , cut his own work to forty hours and then appealed to NRA for the rest of his twelve dollars . The general idea that NRA was expected to put 3,000,000 people to work got around , and a good many thousand thought it meant 3,000,000 new jobs in the NRA department in Washington . They inundated the Commerce Building , and it took weeks to correct that impression . The Blue Eagle drive was one of the greatest of demonstrations of unselfish patriotism , but it brought out a good deal of pure cussedness besides . Fake associations sprang up all over the country to collect dues . All kinds of fake eagles and misuse of consumers ' eagles were shortly discovered . Ninety-five per cent of cases considered were settled by explanation and argument , and yet chiseling never ceased . The climax was a Blue Eagle parade in New York in the early part of September , 1933 , arranged by Grover Whalen , who had been doing the job there . I think it was one of the greatest parades ever held in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the night . It was just a jammed river of humanity flowing up Fifth Avenue , and its distinctive feature was color and cheer  --  cheer such as I had not observed in my four years of previous residence there . These people were convinced that they had seen the worst . Hope and confidence had returned . The First Fruits of NRA That was a high point in NRA history . Within four months , PRA and the Blue Eagle bad : ( a ) Brought 96 per cent of commerce and industry voluntarily under NIRA. ( b ) Abolished sweatshops and child labor . ( c ) Obtained an agreement from 96 per Cent of employers under it to recognize the rights of labor under 7-A. ( d ) Put 2,785,000 breadwinners back on pay rolls and increased annual purchasing power by $3,000,000,000 , and that is several times the aggregate result accomplished by all the other recovery administrations put together . ( e ) Established forty hours as the maximum work week and twelve dollars as the minimum weekly pay for the lowest-paid typo of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages of labor out of the field of industrial competition . ( J ) Changed desperation into hopefulness not only among employees but among employers throughout the country . ( g ) Acted as the greatest single educational force in homely economics in our history . ( h ) Created , for the first time , an economic government throughout the United Stales , imposed upon the political government and nearly as wide in extent . ( i ) Awakened the conscience of the country to its best in terest and its duty to erase these old iniquities . Now , no labor organization on the earth and no conflict between labor and management could have done these things . None of the critics of the Blue Eagle has anything of accomplishment to measure against these results . This was the first effective step that had ever been taken to benefit the white-collar class , and that class , for some reason or other , had never seemed prone to organize , nor have I ever seen , until very recently , any outward move on the part of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be organized . In my opinion , it is only in organization of all the workers ih this country that we can hope for balance in our economic structure . The Unsung Heroes I must hasten to add that I claim no personal credit for these things , even . though in stating them it may seem so . Somebody has to speak for the devoted workers of NRA and I do n't know who else should . The real leader was the President . All credit for inception , inspiration , organization and execution goes to him . To prove this it is only necessary to ask , " What would have been the reaction to the Blue Eagle , the request for PRA 's , the intense enthusiasm that followed , if he had not spoken ? " It would have fallen flat . The people who did the real work were the unpaid volunteers  --  tens of thousands of them  --  in the field and the relatively small and partially unpaid staff in Washington  --  men whose unselfish work I can only sketchily and incompletely describe or accredit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting for the Captain in the White House . To prove this , I need only refer to his initial order , given on June sixteenth , which is so clear and eloquent , and which has been followed so faithfully , as to leave no doubt of where true credit lies . It is impossible to tell the story of NRA in strict chronological sequence of events and carry forward the story of that sequence . Thus it happens that completion of the Blue Eagle campaign , the establishment of the routine of Code making and the approval of the Big Six Codes came at about the same time . That marked a distinct turning point in whatever was to be the program of NRA . I had intended to stay only six months , when I came in April . That was all I could afford . So , at that time , I tried to resign . It has been said that I did so because of the constant sniping of Government subordinates in other Departments , or because of the absence of cohesion , co-ordination and teamwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not so . That was part of the job which I anticipated and expected . It was an added sap on my strength , but it was no cause for my action . This time the President called Inc on the telephone and gave me one of his good-natured scoldings , which I probably richly deserved . I made up my mind then to go 88 THE SATURDAY on until about March , when , as I computed , the bulk of Code making would be finished , we could have a round-up of criticism and complaint , and thus determine any necessary changes in action , policy and organization , and then I thought I could turn readjustment over to others . Nobody knows better than I that the 1933 autumn enthusiasm for the Blue Eagle lapsed for two reasons  --  first , because compliance was not enforced vigorously enough ; second , because no Blue Eagle drives were instituted . When I decided to decentralize some of NRA powers to state directors , I received instructions from the Executive Director of the National Emergency was music ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to be married today . " " I see , " Judy said . She did n't see , of course . Her eyes sought out Douglas Tate in honest bewilderment . " You might call him a honey " ? Kathy had a gift for underemphasis . ) " You quarreled last night . " " Quarreled ? " Linda frowned , " No . No , we did n't . It was a trap and I had to escape from it , that 's all . " " I see , " Judy said again , This , of course , was nothing to her . Up the line she saw Douglas ' thin brown hand go up to the button that summoned the hostess . " New York papers ? " he asked , his mouth quirking strangely . " You  --  you ? " Judy looked-down at him helplessly . " Are you given to brainstorms ? " She gave him the papers in silence , however . She crept back to her place . Well , there they were and here she was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how . " She smiled wryly . Not , she reminded herself hastily , that it was anything to her . They were strangers , perfect strangers . But her eyes crept back . " You do n't either of you look very happy now , " she counseled them . " Do n't you think that if you had got right up to the chancel and had looked into each other 's eyes , something would have clicked and  --  and ? " Douglas Tate merely turned somewhat restlessly in his seat , up ahead . Linda Page 's gorgeous eyelashes came slowly and wearily down . Judy made her way to the cockpit . She had to tell someone about it or burst . " Douglas Tate 's aboard , " she said . " Where to now ? " Johnny Kemmerer , co-pilot today , grinned . " Just away . " Judy 's voice was carefully careless . " Away from his own wedding . It was to be today . " They were whooping . It was incredible , but it was true . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stared curiously for a moment . " Do n't go into a nose dive over it , " she suggested coldly . That was just the sort of thing that would strike a man as being funny , she remembered . " That is n't all . " There was some slight satisfaction in telling them this . " She 's aboard too . The girl . It 's Linda Page . The Linda Page . " " Talk sense , " Bill Morrison invited . " I am . They 're both on this plane , and their wedding was to be today . EVENING POST Council to do nothing until the National Emergency Council should set up its state directors . This held up the creation of a territorial compliance organization for months . Similarly , just us Charles Horner had drawn up a now plan for a rather less spectacular but much more effective Blue Eagle drive , I received instructions from the same source to postpone it until the now Housing drive was ready  --  and that is not ready yet . About this time also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that there was some serious lack of common understanding between what NRA thought and was doing and what the Department of Justice thought and was doing , and that the prospect Neither one has seen the other yet . It  --  it 's the way they 're sitting . " " Wow ! " They were off again . There was no end to it this time . " There should be something we could do , " Judy . began- , and a fresh whoop stopped her . She looked at them hopelessly : If she said any more , they might go into apoplexy . Her eyes clung to - Bill Morrison : " Suppose it had been you and I ? " If she said that ; the Skylark would go into an immediate tail spin . " Why do n't you " ? this was Bill " take your Lovelorn column back into the cabin , duchess ? Just  --  you know  --  let ' em ride . " Let them ride ? Judy 's eyes mourned over Douglas Tate . He 'd had the paper open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His head was moving backward and forward in his hands : And Linda  --  the dusky curtain of lashes was still down . Now and then , scarcely visible tremors shook it. - Surely she was beginning to remember , by this time , all the  --  well , excitement , that must have gone with a wooing of Douglas Tate 's . Judy moved up and down , doing things for passengers . The creamiest brow on Silverline was knit , the bluest eyes were dark . Suppose they were both suffering from the reaction now , and there was some way of confronting them with each other . A shaking hand went up to a button and she hurried down the aisle . An air-sick passenger turned listless eyes upon her and she quickly did things to make him comfortable . " I think " ? the air-sick passenger was directly across from Linda , and a sudden inspiration struck Judy ? " you 'd find it a little easier riding at the front . I 'll see if someone will change seats with you . " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the aisle , and suddenly he stopped short . Here was action . Judy clasped her hands tight . They went on staring at each other and then , " I 'm sorry . " Douglas Tate 's voice was formal . " That 's all . Just that I 'm sorry . I did n't dream you 'd care enough to follow me . I thought , perhaps ? " Linda 's head went up slowly , stiffly. ? to follow you ? " Her eyes gave up trying to find an escape . " Then you 're not  --  following me ? " " Certainly not . I had no idea you were on the plane . " " Ruth might have told you I ? " February 2 , 19.3.5 of prosecution in important cases was not so bright as it might have been .
