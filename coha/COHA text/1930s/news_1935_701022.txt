This city , Mayor La Guardia said yesterday , was ready Ito proceed immediately with work on its projects . In making public his program , the most ambitious and most comprehensive ever drafted here , the Mayor emphasized that complete detailed plans have been made by city experts and engineers on these projects so that work could be started at the completion of satisfactory financial arrangements with the Federal Government . It was learned that negotiations for such arrangements would begin at once . The projects were divided as to methods of financing . The loans for one kind would be carried in the city budget . The second would be separately financed , both as to amortization and collateral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many Types of Improvements . Covered in the proposed city program are transit improvements , construction of a network of sewage and sewage disposal plants , repairing of streets and highways , construction of new hospitals and development of existing hospital facilities , parks and playgrounds , the building of new elementary schools and high schools , a two-year selfliquidating housing program designed to cost $150,000,000 , and a 14-year plan for the development of new sources of water supply for the city from the Delaware at a cost of 1232.000.000 .

This is to be an elevated highway extending from Ninety-sixth Street over the New York Central Railroad tracks to the Harlem River and across , connecting from that point with the Grand Concourse in the Bronx . It Is a self-liquidating project , to be amortized by tolls charged for the use of the Harlem bridge link of the extension . Mayor Classifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed projects , Mayor La Guardia yesterday classified the items on the program as follows : " There is one class of public work that the city can undertake at once , provided always that the interest rate is nominal . I am sure there is no difference of opinion as to my policy of not adding any unnecessary cost to the present interest item in the annual budget . " In addition to that group , there are other projects which can be put into operation provided funds are available from the Federal Government under a financial emergency arrangement not imposing undue and unassumable burdens on the City of New York . " A third classification would take in projects which must finance and secure themselves . By that I mean that the project itself would be the collateral to the Federal Government and the net income would be used for carrying and amortization charges . In other words , self-liquidating projects must stand on their own . " The fourth classification , and my classifications here do not indicate any priority , would be the usual necessary construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firehouses , schools and the like . These are dependent on the terms and conditions under which funds would be available . " It must be understood that each project when the time comes will have to be approved by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment , and authorization for agreements with the Federal Government will likewise have to be approved by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment . In some instances , in order to carry out any new arrangement with the Federal Government or any new method of public works financing , legislation is required and is now in the course of preparation .
