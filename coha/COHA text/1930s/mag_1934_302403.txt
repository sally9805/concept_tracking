Month ago Dr. Robert E. Cornish , jet-haired young University of California researcher , killed two fox terriers with ether and nitrogen , brought them back to life ( TIME , March 26 ) . One dog lived a comatose life of eight hours , the other five hours . Last fortnight Dr. Cornish killed a third terrier . For dog No. 3 , in addition to the oxygen-saturated saline solution , liver extract , adrenalin , canine blood and rocking board with which he resurrected Nos. 1 &; 2 , Dr. Cornish had a new help-gum-arabic , to keep the heart from overworking . Revived , the third dog clung to life day after day . Though unconscious , it blinked and stretched when a window-blind was raised , swallowed when food was forced between its lips , kicked when the reflex centre in its leg was tapped . Early this week it had been alive ten days . Working and watching grimly . Dr. Cornish hoped against hope that he would see dog No. 3 once more frisking about his sombre little laboratory .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
