The day after the election of Pope Pius XII last March , lumbering , untidy , gentle-hearted Heywood Broun wrote a respectful column in which he said : <P> " Quite recently I talked to a newspaper friend of mine who is now a priest . I said to him that I wanted to know if there was anything in Catholicism which stood in the way of any person who believed in political and economic progressivism . And my friend smiled and answered : ' Do n't you realize that you 're a little nave , Heywood ? You like to call yourself a radical , but the doctrines of the Church to which I belong imply so many deep changes in human relationship that when they are accomplished-and they will be-your own notions will be nothing more than an outmoded pink liberalism . ' <P> " Whenever the Church militant begins to march there is no force in the armaments of dictators which can stay its progress . " <P> For Heywood Broun , these seemed strange words indeed . Although he had never attacked a Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him in bludgeoning fashion among the churches , belaboring reactionaries like Bishop James Cannon Jr. , Canon William Sheafe Chase , Anthony Comstock ( in a biography he helped write ) . To many a U. S. churchman , Heywood Broun was a Red , certainly a freethinker , probably an atheist . <P> But last week Heywood Broun was about to accept his marching orders in the Church militant . Gossip-column rumors that he had been converted to Catholicism were , he admitted privately , true . Thus his conversion became the most spectacular since the late Colonel Horace A. Mann 's in 1933 ( Colonel Mann was credited with handing out anti-Catholic propaganda during the Smith-Hoover campaign ) . <P> Brought up in a substantial Episcopal family , Heywood Broun is one of the ablest Bible-quoters in U. S. journalism . At Harvard he was most influenced by a course in the Bible as English Literature . He is today happily married to a Catholic second wife-Constantina Maria Incoronata Fruscella Dooley ( " Connie " ) Broun . But " Connie , " firm as she is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning Catholic . Broun 's conversion came slowly , was sealed in the talk with the newspaper friend turned priest-Rev . Edward Patrick Dowling , S. J. , 40 , associate editor of the Queen 's Work in St. Louis , distant kinsman of Actor Eddie Dowling . Jesuit Dowling , once a crack baseballer , called " Puggy " by St. Louis schoolmates , worked on the Globe-Democrat before he became a priest in 1931 , is today a member of Broun 's Newspaper Guild . <P> To become a Catholic , it is not enough to tell the nearest priest that you want to join the Church . You must hold an intellectual conviction that the Church is the True Church . You must then exhibit a " good will to believe " in God 's revelation . Finally you must make the act of faith , wholly supernatural , in God . At present Heywood Broun is receiving instruction in Catholic belief from one of the ablest of U. S. priests , Monsignor Fulton John Sheen ( who also instructed Convert Mann ) . Columnist Broun will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well become the U. S. equivalent of a famed British convert-the late Gilbert Keith Chesterton , stylist , wit , rough- &-tumble; fighter for the Faith .
