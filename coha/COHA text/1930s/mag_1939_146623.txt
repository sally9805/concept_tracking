Last week , as the shadow of war hung over Europe , the war planet , baleful red Mars , hung bright and big over the world . Astronomers were particularly interested in the red planet , for ( in astronomical figures ) Mars was very close to Earth and getting closer every minute . This week the space gap between Earth and Mars dwindles to 36,030,000 miles-the nearest approach in 15 years . Astronomers have been scanning and photographing Mars for weeks , this week will redouble their efforts . But to the old and battered question which still fascinates laymen-does intelligent life on Mars exist-astronomers good-naturedly gave some old answers and a few new ones . <P> The idea of life on Mars got a big push in 1877 when the Italian Astronomer Schiaparelli* first pictured the vague markings called " canals . " Schiaparelli actually called them canali , which means " channels , " but was translated " canals . " Rivers cut channels , but canals are built by intelligent agents . In the U. S. , Astronomer Percival Lowell picked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly . His theory : the canals were built to bring water from the melting ice of the polar caps , by Martian inhabitants desperately trying to keep their arid lands irrigated . Other astronomers , some with better eyesight than Lowell 's , declared that the canals were optical and psychological illusions . Certainly narrow , clear , straight markings which could be called canals do not show up in photographs , appear at their clearest in the drawings of astronomers who believe in their existence . <P> That there is vegetation on Mars is a fairly plausible assumption . The reddish hue of the planet used to be ascribed to foliage of that color . A more favored explanation nowadays is chemical absorption of oxygen in the soil-that is , oxidation or " rusting " of the Martian terrain . But the dark patches on the planet 's surface grow heavier and more distinct in winter , change from blue-green in summer to chocolate brown in winter . These changes strongly suggest vegetation . The potent chemical compound called chlorophyll is present in all the green plants of Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disclose chlorophyll there . However , chlorophyll is simply the efficient catalyst which terrestrial plants have developed to enable them to store energy from sunlight , and Martian plants may have evolved a different one . <P> The existence of animal life on Mars is anybody 's guess . Mars is smaller , colder , drier than Earth , has a much thinner atmosphere . Adams and Dunham of Mt . Wilson have shown that the oxygen content of the Martian atmosphere must be less than 1% of the Earth 's . Yet among different types of animal life on Earth there are enormous differences in the rate of oxygen intake , and it may be that animals on Mars have adapted themselves to the rare atmosphere by an ultra-slow rate of oxygen consumption . Such animals might be intelligent but they would also be sluggish-probably too sluggish to make plans for invading the Earth .
