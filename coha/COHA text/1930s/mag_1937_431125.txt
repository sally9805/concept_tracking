 | Contrasting Portraits of the Two Dictators Condensed from The Forum Emil Ludwig Famous biographer of Napoleon and Bismarck IF YOU COMPARE the photographs of Mussolini and Hitler at the age of 23 , you will see a man of picturesque head and positive features contrasted with a nondescript youngster who even at that age had no distinguishing characteristics . Hitler , during his formative years , was an idler . With no urge to study , utterly lacking in talent , energy or ideas , he occasionally tried to earn a few cents by selling picture postcards . Mussolini , during his youth , worked in his father 's blacksmith shop . He supported himself from the age of 18 and meanwhile studied persistently . His entire youth was charged with energy and ambition . Before he was 26 he had been imprisoned nine times as a political agitator . He became editor of the greatest Socialist paper in Italy . Whsle Mussolini distinguished himself on the battlefield , there are no regimental records of Hitler 's deeds - those heroic deeds about which German youth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Munich putsch of 1923 he withdrew , leaving several of his friends to be shot down in the streets . And nowadays he will ap- pear at parades only when the streets are lined with three rows of troops . Hitler 's success with the German masses was made possible by his one genuine gift - that of oratory . A great popular speaker has been hitherto unknown in Germany , and Hitler fascinates the Germans because his speeches have something of Wagnerian music - repetition of a few impressive leitmotifs , sobbing and shouting , and , above all , a foggy conglomeration of gods and heroes , blood and race . Mussolini 's metallic tones convey simple sentences in a masculine baritone . When Hitler speaks , he works himself up into hysteria . The apparatus on the platform by which he can turn the spotlight on himself by pressing a button shows how skillfully he manufactures his ecstasy . Mussolini in his triumphant speech after the Ethiopian victory used the word I only twice . Hitler repeats it a hundred times in each speech . Since Mussolini is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Hitler , on the contrary , is uncertain , he talks about himself incessantly . Like Wilhelm II , Hitler affects the strong man because of his in-  | herent weakness . It is an important sidelight on German character that the Germans have twice entrusted their fate to such dazzling , incessantly talking , incessantly threatening neurotics . On this point the difference between Hitler and Mussolini is particularly glaring . Mussolini is well developed physically , a man in every respect To set a good example , he wields an ax and operates a tractor in public . At S3 he took his examination as an airplane pilot . Hitler does not indulge in any sport , can not drive a car , is never seen doing manual work . He has the actor 's desire to play the king in medieval style . Mussolini has added constantly to his store of culture during his dictatorship . He speaks German , French and English fluently . Whenever a visitor leaves him , Mussolini has added something to his own knowledge . Hitler , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rolls his eyes , pounds on the windowsill , and after a torrent of words abruptly dismisses his guest . Mussolini is more gifted than any of his officials , who are , really , all his secretaries . Hitler is overshadowed by some of his ministers , and is superior to them only in the field of propaganda . Mussolini leaves the capital only during the summer , never enters society , never entertains house guests , because he is too busy . Hitler dreads being alone , he dreads silence , and even dreads learning . He spends most of the year at his country home far from Berlin , associating preferably with screen stars . One of the most famous of them tells of such an evening when Hitler gathered some 2o men about him , served wine while he himself drank water , and delivered a monologue for three hours . All this reveals the frustrated actor ever seeking an audience . It also explains why his decisions and actions are so theatrical - and dangerous . Nobody knows where he will strike or when . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this comparison . Under no circumstances is Mussolini planning to start a war in Europe for the expansion of Italy . He is the typical excellent Italian diplomat , realistic and cynical . He will wait and go with the winner . Hitler gambles everything on the supremacy of the Germans , on the expansion of German power . He knows that the Germans really want neither colonies nor the Ukraine . They want nothing but a victory and they will not rest until they have stood once more in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles as triumphant as in 1871 . This is where the mystical actor leads them . With such hopes he electrifics the youth . Although he may at the last moment wish to avoid the war which can swallow  | him , Hitler , like Wilhelm 11 , will nevertheless be forced into it . Mussolini , who is not a mystic but a diplomat , will draw his profit out of Hitler 's war . And it will be Hitler who will pay .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
