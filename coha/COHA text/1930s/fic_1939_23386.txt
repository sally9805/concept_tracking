aVt ANSCHLUSS A STORY BY KAY BOYLE I1E had come out in July to Brenau for two years now , and back twice at Christmas : Merrill , the fashion-editor 's assistant coming from Paris for her vacation in Austria , stepping off the train into this other world of mountains and seeing the dark forests ' shapes lying unaltered in the grass or snow . Fanni was at the station every time to meet her , the strong black silky braids pinned up high round her head and wearing her homemade dirndl and apron . It might have been Fanni that brought her back : they reached out their arms to each other and kissed each other 's face ; but even while the slow , low American voice was saying , ' ' Fanni , here I am again . Here I am back , Fanni , " the travel-weary and fashion-weary eyes were looking for something else besides the scenery and the voice was waiting to say it . Fanni stood looking at her , the smile fixed on her mouth , seeing again not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lashes , the hats that varied from summer towinter , from Descat to Schiaparelli , marveling at the undying scent of Chanel in the Paris clothes . " Is it possible , Fanni , I 'm back ? " the voice went on saying , the naive youthfulness and blitheness masking for a little while the satiety and the concern , calling attention wildly for a moment to something fresher than the scars from thirty years of being gallant and bright . " Fanni , you 're looking so . . . " this or that or the other thing . Or , " I simply love your dress or your shoes or your jacket  --  it 's quilted , is n't it ? You must tell me which shop it came from . I 've got to have one to take back to Paris . They 'd be crazy about it . " If the hotel porter did n't come at once Fanni , being the younger , stooped and without difficulty picked up one of the pigskin bags . They would argue about it , one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Merrill said it was much too heavy for her ; and then when the porter came at last the American woman began laughing her soft , quick , youthful laughter . She could n't think of the German words to say any more  --  only " Guten Tag " and that was as far as she could remember . Out of the station the three of them went , the hotel porter carrying the bags and laughing , and the two young women holding arms and laughing , out into the unfailing miracle of the wintry starlit world or into the stormy blue summer evening 's light . Outside in the square , Merrill knew all the horses and she had saved sugar for them from the dining car . Sugar for horses , said the eyes of the porters and eyes of all the drivers on the boxes of the open carriages or sleighs , and even Fanni 's dark , quiet eyes said it . It was a thing they never got used to seeing : just one more of the lavish , unthinking gestures foreigners made over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty . At one season they would be carriage-horses when she came , drowsing there in the sun with their feed bags on their noses ; and the next time they would be wild eager creatures with their breath white on the air before them , shaking their harness bells and pawing at the thick-packed snow . Only when the two women got to the Gasthaus and sat down at the long , clean , polished table in the public room did Merrill say the words that had been there every instant , what she had come across these countries alone to utter , had waited , mouth shut and eyes worn with despair over cocktail glasses , manicure tables , typewriter keys , programs of couture openings , shorthand notes , to ask month after month , " Fanni , how 's Toni ? How is he making out ? " She looked away when she said it , taking her gloves off or her cigarettes out , or seeking for her lighter in her bag . Nothing was ever changed in the warm dim room except the season 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand and the next time cool , and hot red wine in the glasses instead of beer . Or else the changes in the waiters ' faces : this one in jail for political agitation and another one moved on to somewhere else because he had worked his three months out of the year there and could go home and collect his dole in leisure for the months ahead . And Merrill , drinking the beer or the wine and chewing at the big tough pretzels , would look at something else and say : " How 's Toni , Fanni ? I must say he 's the most unsatisfactory letter-writer ! What 's he doing now ? " Fanni would take a swallow from her glass and shake her head . " Doing ? " she 'd say , wondering anew that this useless and uneasy thing must be asked . " Oh , nothing . You know the way it is here . There is nothing for anybody to do . He makes things out of wood of course a little , and he plays , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was the sign for them to burst out laughing again , screaming , shrieking , rocking with laughter together , as if Toni were the name for half-wit , for village nut , for the queer white-headed boy ; or as if this were a family joke they 'd never get over if they lived to be a hundred , a pain in the side , an ache in the face season after season instead of the two syllables describing glory , naming at last the animal and golden-flanked Apollo toward whom their love turned , sistered by his power . Here they sat , summer or winter , laughing fearfully at it : Toni , my brother , said Fanni 's slow , silent , loving tongue , and Merrill strangled in her nervous fingers Toni , Toni , my strange , wild , terrible love  --  the two women laughing and laughing as if the time would never come to wipe their eyes and speak coherently of him . This year they had left it like this : whether there was the Anschluss or whether there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the summer just the same . You ca n't change a people 's ways or their faces overnight , Merrill said for two months to herself in Paris . Her right hand was free of its good glove , and the silver-mounted pencil in her fingers flew at the paper while the mannequins in winter suits , fur wraps , ski ensembles came down the carpeted floor toward the double row of seated women , hesitated , turned lingeringly , and mounted the salon 's length again . " Really adorable fur buttons , leather-frogged , " she jerked down , " like your very smartest Hussars . " Her left fingers took the cigarette from her lips and snuffed it out in the metal engraved dish while her right hand blocked quickly down in the still girlish American script : " Upper sleeves built to assist any filly beyond her first carefree youth to shoulder the responsibility of looking sixteen and spirited this winter . " Outside was the Paris heat , July 's , and Merrill thinking : once this farce of the openings is through I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannequins , sister-journalists , sales ladies to be split into two categories if you caught them unawares : those who went upward out of choke and looked a mountain in the eye and those who took their clothes off at once and went to sleep on beaches . The Nordic and the Mediterranean blood , each manifestation of it going back to its source , like eels up out of the water with a flick of the tail and covering ground , field , thicket , swamp , wood , returning to their own latitude to breed . " Hats this winter , " she wrote , " are likely to be taken by your little girl to put on her Dy-dee doll if you do n't watch out . " All the seas in the world could dry up and the beaches turn to oyster shells and I would n't care , she thought , noting that wimples were worth a word or two , as long as they left Austria and the mountains and the people exactly the way they were . All because of one winter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night air that stabbed you to the heart when you put your furs on and stepped in fur boots on to the packed white road . Not the scenery or the ski-jumps or the country making history , but one man 's face and the muscles in his jaws flickering like breath in and out when he played the mouth-organ , his fingers on the metal and the music held clear and steady in the palm of his thin tough hand . That was the first year out , and the Englishman she 'd talked with on the train came into the hotel dining room that night and sat down in his place at table with her , his jowls freshly shaved , the gray at the temples brushed back with oil and forethought . Outside the road , carved through the stiff pure drifts , led off toward St. Johann , and the moon and mountains halted in the vast icy , paralytic light . " By the way , " said the Englishman , clearing his throat . " Have you looked out the window to-night ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A night for ? " " Romance ? " said Merrill wearily , and she lighted a cigarette in the middle of the meal as any American would . The ex-army officer 's eyes turned rather fearfully on her , then down the room 's length while he laughed . " Well , I do n't know as I 'd go quite that  --  I do n't know as I actually ? " he began , looking for help down at the thick black sauce and slices of the game . " I was thinking of tracking down a sleigh , " he said , not daring to make it definitely an invitation yet . " Thought of taking a little run as far as the next village . " He cleared the hesitation from his throat again and let his blue frightened eye rest on her face . Rather pretty , he might have been thinking ; or damned pretty but a little worn , or thinking : chic , blonde , I should say not over thirty . There might be something in it for a chap . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to persuade you , " he said , to throw a few togs on and ? " The sleigh-driver lifted the three rugs , like three long-locked gray , shaggy animals with shape and life and obstinacy of their own , up off the floor and laid them across their legs , thrust them behind their feet , beat them into submission around them , and then he mounted to the seat and took the reins up and spoke the word the horses ' ears were twitching in the moonlight for . The instant they moved , the bells they wore broke sharply into speech and then settled with the horses ' gait into a high , clear , puny chatter which the silent indifference of the fields and the hills and the moon 's marble eye neither awed nor subdued . Beneath the rug 's uncombed hide the Englishman 's hand moved tentatively toward Merrill 's and halted when she said : " The human race might just as well die of its own insignificance on a night like this . But please give me a cigarette before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best for you , she thought , the poor helpless American gill 's defense ; and there was the poor English army bloke , without his army and without his medals , shorn of his pith helmet and stripped of his crop and saber , sitting mortally wounded by her side . He was telling her about the French , holding the lighter to the cigarette 's end for her ; chap knew he was being done in as soon as he put his foot on French soil . The lighter 's flame lighted up his features for an instant , the packed rosy jowl , the graying temple under the Tyrolean hat 's brim , the bulging , blue , glazed eye . He 'd seen all he wanted of them in the War and the state they 'd Ieft their billets in for decent troops to move into after . He was saying this and other things like it to the aloof bright wastes of the night , and Merrill felt her blood moving wearily in her , wearily harking and hating , without hope or passion knowing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , this is the way it will go on forever ; when without warning the harness , strap , trace , yoke , or whatever nameless link of security it was , snapped or unbuckled and the lefthand horse broke partially free . He skipped to one side on the ends of his hoofs in panic , and the sleigh jerked halfway into the drift as the second horse rose his full height in terror into the sharp air . There was nothing to do but climb out of the tipping sleigh and undo the frightened beasts completely now , the Englishman and the Austrian driver working together at it while Merrill walked back and forth in the cold , stamping her fur boots softly on the snow . The thing was not to be repaired ; even with the handful of knotted cord out of the driver 's pocket there was no way to lash the rotted leather end to end . So they must set off on foot toward the lights of the first houses which were St. Johann , the man leading the two animals by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chastened complaint ; the ex-army man , in that intimacy born of peril , had put his arm through Merrill 's and they followed behind . Now and again the horses ' droppings fell before them on the moonlit road , dropped and lay steaming in rich , warm indecorum in the heart of the night 's icy austerity . " Listen to the way our footsteps cry in the snow , " she said . " Listen , listen . " His fingers were feeling down her arm forher naked wrist , and if he touches me , she thought in quiet fury , I 'll strike his fact , I 'll kill him . Her blood and being were filled with grief , weighted and numb with an inexplicable sorrow as she watched the breath shaping white from her mouth on the frosty air . This is the way life goes on , and now I am old and nothing wonderful can ever happen . " Listen , " she said , with the tears of weakness and pity ready to fall from her eyes , " listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice could suddenly be heard singing , singing loud and joyous from the houses , shouting out of the dark walls and the small , shut , lighted windows the perfection of belief or youth or love in warbling wonder , the yip-ai-daidy-day , lari-liti-Ioe . In a minute the Englishman had opened the inn 's door before Merrill and the clear block of light fell yellow across her furs and her face and on to the road where the horses and man were turned toward the stables . Before them in the room , near to the high green stove , three people sat at a table : a young woman with black braids round her head , and the two others older  --  perhaps the woman and man who owned the place because they stood up and bowed when the strangers came in . " God greet you , " they said , and Merrill answered eagerly : " God greet you . " It was the first time she had laid eyes on Fanni or heard her voice , Fanni sitting drinking hot wine with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would speak her slow , solemn English to them as much as they liked , her eyes black , bright , merry , like a peasant 's with a craftiness and a conjecture hard and good as flint behind them . She lived in Brenau but she had driven down with her brother to see their aunt and uncle for the evening . Her brother 's horse and sleigh were in the stable , she said . If their driver could n't get the harness fixed she and her brother would take them back to Brenau . " I must say , that 's awfully kind of you , " said the Englishman . " Order them more wine , " said Merrill without looking at him but at Fanni 's face . " That was you singing when we came along the road , was n't it ? " she said . " I know it was you . It was the most beautiful voice I 've ever heard . I 'd give my whole life , I 'd give anything in the world to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm cheeks , and the full neck , and the girl 's bare , hard , white arms crossed on the table , her own ringed , nervous hand with the painted nails touching the glass of sweetened , steaming wine . " It 's wonderful to sing like that because it means you 're happy . It 's like the mountains and the moonlight , like these wonderful old houses that are n't like any other houses in the world . You just ca n't help singing like that . That 's what makes it so marvellous . " " Yes , I 'm happy , " Fanni said , speaking slowly , casually . " They let my brother out of jail to-day . I 'm happy , " and now that Merrill heard the word " brother " said again she knew it was this that had brought them out at night in the cold and snapped the harness in the frost and wooed them like the singing to this place . " My brother 's horse and sleigh , my brother 's this , that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother 's sacred blood and bone , " the song was warbled high and low . " What is his name ? " Merrill asked . Now she had drunk she felt the color in her cheeks and her flesh was hot and quick with promise : the fur hood tied still round her glowing face , her muff laid on the table in expectancy so that the hands were free to seize on whatever was to come . " Toni , " Fanni said , and at once she began to sing . " Order another carafe of wine , " said Merrill without looking at the Englishman , and the old Austrian stood up from the table with the empty pitcher hanging from his hand and waited while the girl 's voice rose and dipped and sprang with grace and sinew about them , yodelling as clear as water falling the ohs , the ahs , the lees , the lies in silver beads of sound . MAGAZINE " Oh , lovely , how lovely ! " Merrill cried out in sweet hysteria when it was done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt the brilliance , wild and unbearable , of her own ; the suddenly rekindled blaze of what animal beauty , after years of fashion sketches , fashion notes , hints , cribs , boat trains , special articles , the British royal family 's wardrobes and decisions , still remained . In a minute the door may open , she thought , to what , to what ? She held her breath , her eyes fixed in intoxication on Fanni 's face . In just a minute the door may open and it may happen , even to inc it may happen . But it was merely the Englishman who cleared his throat and said to Fanni : " Alt , just what is it you do , if I may ask ? Are you a singer ? That is , I was just wondering what it is you do ? " " Do ? " said Fanni , looking up in surprise . " Do ? " Shc bared her white small teeth , not laughing , perhaps not even smiling . " Meitt Gott ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The innkeeper came back to the table with the pitcher of smoking wine and set it down , and the Englishman said " Ala ! " cheerily and stretched out his hand for it . This movement and every other sound stopped short when the door from the back-room opened suddenly and quietly . " Griiss Gott , die Herschaf ten , " said the man who closed it behind him . He must have just come in from the cold for his face was fresh with it and his jacket was buttoned up close from his narrow hips to his chin . He was neither short nor tall , light nor dark , heavy nor lean , but his shoulders stood wide in the jacket 's cut and the sides of his face were hollow . He took off his skier 's beaked cap and slung it on to the peg by the door , and his hair was lighter than his sister 's hair and even touched with yellow at the temples . He wore jumper 's trousers , funneling to the ski-boots ' leather lip , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others sat he pulled off his gloves and unbuckled the strap of his jacket with one strong , quick hand . 61114.46o1.2t0 110 .. 444ansiio1 ANSCHLUSS 479 That was the first night ; that was the beginning . That was in 1936 when he drove her home on the seat beside him while Fanni and the Englishman rode behind . That was the winter he taught her to ski , and they climbed the mountains on skis at night and slept in huts and refuges together . Being young in a country where the young had no function because no occupation , they were none of them , none of the young Merrill met with them that year , either rich or poor , workers or idlers , successful or not . The standards other countries knew were gone , slipped down the mountain like the avalanches that thundered their long way down in the spring . One season Toni was a ski-teacher , and the next a guide on Sundays , a carpenter in the week , a harmonica player , a carver of small wooden monstrosities . Like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ une schilling paid out by foreigners was added to another . The whole little town , the entire country perhaps , with no choice but to make shift with this way of doing : eating what was cheap and drinking only a little and dancing because dancing could be had for nothing , and all of it so casually accomplished , with such a fugitive , careless abandon , as if they all knew that something else was going to happen in a little while . " What will you do this winter , Fanni darling ? " Merrill would ask . She might be doing her nails or putting fresh rimmel on her lashes , but when she thought of the future and put these questions to them there would be the intense American anxiety in her face to be enlightened , to have the thing arranged , to know . " What kind of work do you think you 'll be able to do this winter , Fanni ? " Or climbing the hills in the night 's dark with Toni , the uncertainty of what the end would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Toni , my love , my love , what kind of work can you do when the snow 's gone ? How will you ever manage to live at all ? " " But I live , " said Toni . " I live . I 'm stronger than any man in Paris . Sitdown . By the tree there , sit down . I wish to tell you . " The snow had melted at the roots of the tree and they sat on the black pine needles that had fallen thickly there . He did not put his hand out toward her or draw her close in his arms , but here was his power , cold , marvellous , aloof , dismantling her , weakening her , leaving her no speech . " I eat , I drink , I love a woman , this woman , " he said , and he was looking down at the lights in the valley below . " Yes , but what does it lead to . It does n't lead to anything , " she said , hearing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , it leads . It is being alive . It is being a man , " he said without turning his head . " But it does n't lead , " she said . " I go back to Paris , the snow melts in the spring , you ca n't give any more ski lessons , you have no money . It does n't lead to anything . It does n't lead to marriage , for instance , " she said . Nowhere else in the world could it happen , she thought in irritation : the future depending on the amount of snow that fell or did n't . Nowhere else could one join that procession of women who went out from the church after midnight mass into the graveyard , carrying their little Christmas trees to the dead , crossing the snow with the ribbons and tinsel shining and the match-small candles flickering in the air . There the women kneeled down in the wintry midnight , shielding the candles ' flames in their hands , and set their trees out in a lighted forest on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnamable yearning , this sweet sad longing which spoke its own humble tongue to the lost and the bewildered who traveled from other countries to attend this miraculously staged performance of economic disaster . In January , just before she must get back to Paris for the openings , they arrested Toni again and put him into jail . But there was no shame or even wonder to it as there would have been in any other place on earth . It was merely another part of the spectacle to see him at the high barred window , his ski-jacket on because there was no heat inside those walls , and his harmonica playing fast and recklessly . Fanni and Merrill went down the back-street at night and tried throwing a comb up the height of the Rathaus to him , and it struck three times against the bars and fell again before he got it , and each time he missed it he giggled like a girl . That 's what I love , she thought wildly ; that 's what I love  --  that dark faceless shadow leaping like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing like a nut when perhaps they 'll hang him to-morrow , and she turned to Fanni with her voice shaking in her throat . " Political agitation , " she said fiercely , as if she had not said the same thing a hundred times before . " But what kind of political agitation ? Why ca n't he have a lawyer and a room to himself if he 's a political prisoner ? " " Mein Gott , it 's nothing ! " said Fanni . This softness , this female fury in the strange foreign woman was enough to take even the significance of truth away . She stood , a little shorter than Merrill , in the snow-covered back-street , both of them held and hidden in the shadow of the Rathaus wall . The street lamp was farther along , but even without its light Fanni could see or else remember the beauty of the other woman 's face , fragile , nervous , balked , with the little lip trembling and the eyes painted blue and starry as a child 's , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual sight or else the photograph of it fixed indelibly in Fanni 's dark , shrewd , merry eyes . " He 'll be out again in three or four days , " she said , wanting to touch : Vferrill 's arm perhaps but not knowing how to make the move . " It 's happened so often . It happens to them all if they go round lighting the fires . It 's treason  --  is that the word you said it was ? ? yes , treason , a small treason , very little , to light the swastika fires on the hills at MAGAZINE " Peaches ! " Toni 's voice called down to them . " Merrill , can you got me peaches ? " " Get , not got ! " Fanni called up the wall . " It 's a joke , " she said to Merrill . " He thinks that is very funny . He saw those pictures with colors on them about peaches in the American magazines you have . " " Fanni , I ca n't bear it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't bear it . I 'll get him diamonds . I 'll buy his way out if they 'll let me . " All the way back to the middle of town they could hear the harmonica playing , the little grief in it now nursed in the hollow of his hand and asking in warbling nostalgia for a homeland that had perhaps never been or for a hope without a recognizable or possible name to give it . Night after night he played until the evening he came out , and Fanni walked on ahead to let them kiss each other by the wall . " Merrill , I like the perfume again , " he said against the hood 's fur . " Toni , Toni , " she said , holding to him , and she felt the tears running down her face . " Toni , we can do something together . You do n't have to stay here . You could go to France with me  --  you could ? " " I 've never been into a city , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the thought of himself wearing city clothes . " I have to stay here in my country . I 'm too poor a one for you . " " I 'm old enough to take care of you , much older than you , " she whispered and he held her hard against him . " You are my doll , " he said , saying it savagely and hotly against the hood 's white fur . " You smell good like a doll , and little small teeth like that . If I wanted to do it , I could break you as children do with a doll , pull your arms out and break all your little bones in your skin ? " He bit quickly at her cheek and chin and lip , soft , dry , nibbling bites at powder , scent , and rouge , and she looked up at him with the tears still on her face . MOO t ? *MAK grit " Toni , I 've put red all over your mouth and my mascara 's running , " she whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I 'll keep it like that on my face . never wash it away . " Then in 1938 it happened ; it happened in the spring . The German troops went over the border without a word and there was the Anschluss , and maybe he 'll be singing a different tune about it now that he 's got it , thought Merrill . Perhaps he 'll want to get out of the country by hook or by crook now he 's got what he 's been wasting behind bars for . They wo n't be able to change his face or the shape of his hands or his mouth singing what words he did ; not love ditties on top of a mountain , nor popular airs , nor things of classic pricelessness , but the pure loud clarion call of " Austria , Awake , Awake ! " Awake and in your right mind by this time , I should hope , thought Merrill , buying the ticket to go back ; united and awake and in her senses she ca n't cast the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his glance on one direction . His country nor no other can make a lawabiding man out of what he is . He 'll go on rebelling , shouting the Nazis down as he shouted the Catholics and the Communists and Schuschnigg out of countenance , revolting now in the same cool , careless way against what he 's been wearing the flesh of his bones to get . For the first time , stepping off the train at Brenau , she could not fling her arms out to Fanni or kiss her face , nor draw that first deep draught of other air in before she said , " Fanni , it 's like falling asleep again and finding the same dream still waiting for you . " This time she must stand waiting on the platform alone , turning from the far sight of snow on the mountain tops to the shady , summery road leading off under the heavy boughs toward the first hotels where the swastikas on the flagpoles folded and unfolded languidly on the breeze . Fanni did not come running late down the pathway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picket fence . The sun shone hot in the waning afternoon , thunder clouds were gathering on the rocky horns at the valley 's end , and the horses sneezed in their feed-bags on the square outside . In a moment the hotel porter came through the station door , took off his cap , and said , " Heil Hitler " and shook her hand . " Griiss Gott , " said Merrill brightly , and then she started laughing as usual because she could n't think of the German words to say . " Und Fraulein Fanni  --  und ? Frdulein Fanni ? " She said it over several times to him , but he only shook his head and stooped to pick her bags up . All he knew was that the hotel had raised his wages and that the place was full of Germans , full of them , just like the old days again before the frontier was closed , and they 'd put a new uniform on him . He made her feel the cloth of the jacket . " Oh , gut ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perfectly lovely ! Tri  --  s gut , Hermann ! " At the Gasthaus the letter was waiting for her , and standing in the room where Fanni had always been she read it once quickly , and then reread it slowly . After she had folded it in the envelope again she took it out and stood reading it over . You will forgive me for not being at the station , Merrill , or words similar to this it said . Now I am district nurse and I can not choose my own time . To-day I must go on my bicycle to Kirchberg to arrange about the vacations for some expecting mothers and I shall then have to report what I have done at the office when I get hack . So , please , may I come in this evening and see you ? We are all very well organized now . Toni is Sports ' Organizer at the lake , so if you go swimming this afternoon you will see him . He is also Director of the Austrian Youth Local . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him swimming , he too will come in and visit you with me to-night . So until we meet , my dearest friend . Even the little bathing cabins , set out in rows on the south side of the lake , were topped by swastika banners , small ones fluttering in dozens against the wide somber mountain waters . This place , where before so few people had come , was now singularly alive : the refreshment tables crowded and bathers lying on the wooden platform that sloped to the edge , swimmers basking on the floats , bathers stretched reading their newspapers and smoking on the summer grass . Enormous , thick-thighed , freckled-shouldered , great-bellied people , not Austrians but invading cohorts come across the border with heads shaved close to baldness , speaking the same tongue and bearing vacation money to a bankrupt land . The air was filled with their voices as they called across the echoing waters , the hullabaloo of monstrous jokers gurgling at the surface , the shower and impact as the great bodies dropped from the diving boards and smote the tranquil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and plain , the women wearing skirted ones with modest backs and necks , and Merrill changed into her pale-blue two-piece suit in the cabin and looked down at the strip of delicately tanned skin between the top and trunks and wondered . I never minded wearing this before , she thought . Why do they make me know I 'll look a queer fish among them : hair curled , mouth painted , thin as a rake , and halfnaked ? With something almost like shame she stepped out of the cabin door into the cool mountain air . The storm was gathering quickly in the valley and in a little while the sun would be gone . Once she looked up she no longer saw the people : the heavy sloping shoulders , the shaved narrow pates , the folds of obscene hairy flesh at neck or chest , or cared for whatever insult or censure now stood in their eyes . Toni was on the springboard , ready to take the high dive , the heels lifted , the calves small as fists with muscle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement not made yet but just about to come .

" Toni , " she said in silence , " Toni , Toni , " watching his hands part the surface and the body slide perfectly into the water 's place . Once he had risen , visible as light floating upward from the depths , and shaken the drops from his face and hair and thrust the locks back , she was at the edge and kneeled there , waiting . " Toni , " she said out loud , and immediately he turned his head , wiping the water from his mouth and chin , and treading water . He took the five long strokes that brought him to her and reached his fingers to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanned yellowish , the square nails clean , his upper lip drawn back upon his teeth , and then he lifted himself out , dripping , and stood on the wood . " Mein Gott , Merrill , you look like somebody from the theater , " he said quickly . For a minute she might not have heard him , sitting there mindless , heedless , watching his wet bare feet stain the boards beneath them with water as if a shadow were spreading imperviously across the weather-rotted and time-rotted wood . She looked at the small , strong , perfectly molded ankle-bones with the skin drawn over them like tight , sheer silk , and suddenly , as if at that instant she heard the quickly uttered words or just at that instant understood , she jerked her eyes up to his face . " What time did you get in ? " he said . " Fanni showed me the letter you wrote . I thought you said this week some time ? " " No , to-day , " said Merrill . She sat squinting up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sun was shining , feeling in panic her half-nakedness , the thinness almost skeletonlike among these people , the strip of body between breast and navel obscene , infecund . " It 's quite gay here , is n't it ? " she said , making a gesture with her naked pale arm and hand . " Quite different , is n't it ? " " No , it is not gay , " he said . He was smoothing his upper arms dry with the palms of his hands . " They are not like the English and American people who came here before . They know we are a country , not a playground . They respect us . They do not come to dress up for parts in a musical comedy the way the other people did . " She sat there at his feet , squinting up at him , watching him turn to pick the bath towel off the springboard 's trellis and start rubbing his shoulders with it . " It is very serious here now , " he said . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have changed for us . " And then he said quickly , " The nails of your toes , Merrill , " squatting down on his thighs to come nearer to her and so say it the more violently and brutally . Merrill looked startled the length of the legs curved under her to the ten dull red medallions varnishing their extremities . " Wear that in Paris . Wash it off before you come here to us , " he said . " Now we 're busy we have n't time for people masquerading . We are n't the tourists ' paradise any more . People ca n't come and pay to see us dance and roll over on our backs like bears with rings through the nose ? " " Toni , you got what you wanted , did n't you ? " Merrill said in a low , quiet voice , sitting there without movement , even the nervous hands lying still . " You got what you were working for , did n't you , Toni ? " " Yes , " he said , " yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Merrill , do n't go , but just put a bathrobe round you . Everyone here is looking at you like something out of the Tiergarten . Nobody 's used to suits like that or paint like that on the mouth ? " That was the next to last time she saw him . The last time was when she took the train the day after at the station , and he was there on the platform with half a dozen others , all young , all neatly uniformed in gray and green and smartly belted at the waist . They were there to meet the Innsbruck train which must have been bringing officials on it , and when he saw her on the other side of the glass his face altered and he took a step forward as if he were about to speak , as if it were not too late to say it . But the movement of the car passed like a veil between them and he brought his heels sharply together and lifted his right hand and she saw his lips open as he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and that was all .
