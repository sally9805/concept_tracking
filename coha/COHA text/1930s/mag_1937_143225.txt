MORE JOY IN HEAVEN - Morley Cal-laghan-Random House ( $2.50 ) . <P> In his earlier work Morley Callaghan gave promise of being a sharply sensitive realist . Perhaps it is the haze of his native Toronto , perhaps it is only the gentling-down that many a prancing Pegasus goes through as it is broken to the book trade , but he seems now to be turning into a mystically misty romantic . Since undertones of the realistic approach remain , the result is , at times , confusing . <P> His latest story tells of Kip Caley , bank robber and desperado , who , while serving time for one of his jobs , suddenly decides to go straight . A fellow of huge frame and equally mighty enthusiasms , he turns over his new page with all the gusto of a Billy Sunday , joins prison Bible classes , uplifts fellow convicts . The reform of so notable a character attracts wide attention , and soon newspapers , hometown politicians , even a Senator join in a successful campaign for his release . Paroled , Kip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his freedom , too exalted by his recent conversion to do more than burble : " I want to be a good man , to fit into things ... get a little closer to people . ... " The rest of the book is the story of his efforts to live up to his resolutions , and his eventual defeat . <P> The prison chaplain makes the best suggestion : that Caley take a job as his gardener until the excitement about him dies down . Instead , the Senator carries him off to the city , shows him off to his friends for a while , then-puzzled by the big fellow 's innocent evangelism-gets him a sort of personal-appearance job at a night club . Caley reigns there for a time , falls in love , gets his life story printed in the newspapers . Then people again turn apathetic . With only shady prospects before him now , Caley realizes at last how little belief there was in his good intentions , how cheaply sensational the general interest had been .

Unless the title is completely ironical , this finale must be the act of redemption which causes joy in Heaven " over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , which need no repentance . " <P> The book contains at least one very good passage : the description of the street fight and chase in which Caley receives his death wound . Most readers will agree that Caley in his bedazzled guilelessness , his dumb trustingness , is basically well conceived . It is in the development of the story that things go astray , and it is the author 's wavering method of attack that causes the trouble . A love affair that starts hard-boiled ( " Aw , come on . Give me a break . . . . We all get pushed around . " ) goes suddenly opalescent . ( " . . . A part of me that is still hard and stiff is broken and everything comes flowing in light and warm .

Most readers will end the book a little baffled-feeling as if they had been shown a brisk bit of action , but forced to view it through pink-tinted ground glass . <P> The Author .
