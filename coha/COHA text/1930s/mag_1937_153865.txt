Local No. 1 <P> As he closed his desk in Chicago 's Bowen High School one day last March and made ready to go home , Principal William T. McCoy , whose work had only a few days before been commended by Chicago 's Superintendent William H. Johnson , received a curt message from the superintendent ordering him to report next morning at an elementary school with a $700 reduction in salary . Not long after , Superintendent Johnson announced a new eligible list for principals . Of the 155 successful candidates on the examination , 128 had come from Loyola University , where Superintendent Johnson teaches . Of the 15 principals promptly appointed from this list , one was Board of Education President James B. McCahey 's sister , Marie McCahey , who had previously failed in three tests for a high-school teaching license . Several others were relatives of city officials . Soon the Chicago Board of Education was defending three suits charging violation of the merit system . <P> Last week these professional sparks had ignited a conflagration that threatened to consume the educational branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay days and hunger ( TIME , March 7 , 1932 et seq. ) had failed to do-unite Chicago 's warring teachers ' organizations-the rankling McCoy and McCahey episodes had accomplished . <P> Before 3,500 people in Chicago 's huge Civic Opera House last week , the Men 's Teachers Union , Federation of Women High School Teachers . Elementary Teachers Union and Playground Teachers Union dissolved , buried their differences , received from Irvin R. Kuenzli. secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Teachers , a charter as the Chicago Teachers Union . Local No. 1 of the Federation . With 6,500 members , one-half the total teaching staff of Chicago 's public schools . the largest and most powerful teachers ' union in the U. S. was born . <P> After speeches , songs and organ music , up rose Local No. 1 's acting president , John M. Fewkes , 38 , to defy the Board of Education . Informing the audience that a board stenographer was taking notes , he shouted : ' T hope they get an earful . " He proceeded to pledge the new union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's schools . Shaking his fist , he cried : ' ' Let them fire 6,500 of us ! " <P> Thus aligned against their Board of Education for the first time , half of Chicago 's teachers were embarked on an ambitious crusade , in which the restoration of the merit system was only one aim . Still suffering from a 22% pay cut , the teachers were out to gain the salary restorations that nearly every other major U. S. city has already made to teachers . They were out also to repair the butchery of the Chicago school system-denounced by such Titans in education as University of Chicago 's President Robert Maynard Hutchins and Dean Charles Hubbard Judd - which has gained for Chicago 's schools the reputation of being the poorest and most expensive in the U. S. Of the $52,000,000 budget this year , only $35,000,000 went for instruction . Struck down in the past few years have been kindergartens , continuation schools , the junior college , junior high schools , manual training , domestic science and physical training in elementary schools . In one-half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in.
