In Valparaiso , Chile last week half a ton of live lobsters were loaded on a plane , sent scudding across the jagged Andes to Argentina . The city of Buenos Aires , on the muddy River Plata where there are no lobsters , was having a party . <P> The occasion was the state visit of paunchy , pompous Senhor Getulio Vargas , President of Brazil , to big , soldierly President Agustin P. Justo of Argentina . In 1933 President Justo paid a call on President Vargas in Rio de Janeiro which was notably successful in furthering trade and tourist traffic between the two countries . Now with suggestions from the Silver Jubilee in London , and a few original ideas of her own . Argentina was set to give her Brazilian neighbors a return welcome they would not soon forget . <P> The thousand pounds of lobster were a mere nothing . Up the broad Plata nosed the Brazilian battleship Sao Paulo with President Vargas aboard , the cruisers Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul , escorted by two Argentine battleships , six cruisers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 13 Brazilian naval planes that had flown all the way from Rio de Janeiro . There should have been 18 , but three were forced down at Rio Grande do Sul and two were reported missing . Crowds along the waterfront cheered the survivors to the echo . <P> Already in the harbor was the Brazilian transport Siqueira with 600 army and navy cadets aboard , and Brazil 's pride , the brass band of the Brazilian Military Academy . Up to the dock where waited President Justo , and in their shiniest toppers , his entire Cabinet , warped the great Sao Paulo . Guns belched out national salutes , and in the midst of the hubbub there was suddenly a great banging of crate lids and fluttering of wings . Members of the Buenos Aires Pigeon Society were releasing 10,000 bewildered white birds , each with one wing striped blue and white for Argentina , the other yellow and green for Brazil . <P> In a State carriage , escorted by Argentine grenadiers , the two Presidents drove along the boulevards to the Presidential palace and a lobster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-seven thousand Argentine school children , piping Brazilian patriotic airs in Portuguese , marched in one parade . President Vargas snipped a ribbon to open the newly widened Avenida Corrientes , driven at great expense through the middle of the business district . For eight city blocks it was roped off from traffic while 14 tango bands kept citizens dancing till dawn . <P> Violinist Fritz Kreisler opened his South American season with a recital . Belle Didjah , U.S. interpretative dancer , gave a performance of mechanistic eurythmics , and Ettore Panizza , fresh from the Metropolitan Opera in New York , conducted Gluck 's Alceste . To entertain the swarms of Brazilian tourists that followed the fleet half a dozen road companies were giving dramatic performances in Portuguese . <P> Saturday was Argentina 's Independence Day in memory of that May day in 1810 when crowds in Buenos Aires forced the resignation of the last Spanish viceroy and set up a native junta to govern the country . Presidents Justo &; Vargas reviewed Brazilian cadets , aviators and most of the Argentine army from a stand in Congress Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a bad cold but he kept bravely on with the celebration .
