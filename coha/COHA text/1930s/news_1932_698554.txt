Colonel Knox said he had been in touch with all parts of the country and that the demand for " a safe and secure substitute for currency " now hoarded was nation-wide in extent . The only way to meet the demand , he added , was the issuance of lowdenomination bonds . He hoped the securities would be called " reconstruction bonds .
