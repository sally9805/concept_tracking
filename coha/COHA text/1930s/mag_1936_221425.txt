Infant though it be , the science of rocketry is not confined solely to crack-brained dreams of launching a howling projectile on its way to the moon . Rockets , in fact , have passed one definite milestone : they have traveled at 700 m.p.h. , faster than any other self-propelled mechanism . The moon idea grew out of the solid fact that , unlike airplanes , rockets do not need air either for support or propulsion since they are pushed along by self-generated recoil forces . <P> Last week in Manhattan Professor Alexander Klemin , director of the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aeronautics , informed members of the Electrochemical Society of the present progress and problems of rocketry . He pointed out that the burned gas molecules shoot out of a rocket 's combustion chamber at 3,000 to 4,000 ft. per sec . A rocket traveling at this speed would be 100% efficient , since all the recoil force of the molecules is turned into forward thrust . <P> One vexatious problem is that of weight . Fuel tanks must be light but capable of withstanding high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tanks and motor but not for the jet nozzles which often collapse in a few minutes . This is due not only to heat but also to the abrading effect of the issuing gases . " Will electrochemists supply us , " asked Professor Klemin , " with another super-aluminum alloy to withstand all this ? " <P> Most gratifying progress made so far has been in the matter of fuel . Since a rocket is like an upward moving gun firing continuously at the ground , it was natural for the first experimenters to use gunpowder . But powder burned unevenly and it was extremely dangerous . The new technique is to use liquid oxygen and a liquid fuel such as gasoline or alcohol , which do not mix until the rocket is ready to go off . Such a mixture develops energies ten times greater than TNT . <P> Developer of liquid fuel is Robert Hutchings Goddard , rangy , bald , 53 , foremost U. S. rocketeer . Born in Worcester , Mass. , where he became professor of physics at Clark University , Goddard started puttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12,000 over a period of twelve years . When one of his contraptions blew up over Worcester , the terrified townsfolk forced him to desist . He moved to Camp Devens , later to the desert near Roswell , N. Mex . Since 1930 his expenses have been paid by the Guggenheims . <P> To cure the tendency of rockets to wabble in flight , Dr. Goddard has worked out a small gyroscope that keeps his missiles in line by switching the tail vanes when necessary . Equipped with this and launched from his 60-ft. tower , Dr. Goddard 's latest model , a twelve-footer weighing 140 Ib. with fuel , has reached speeds of 700 m.p.h. , heights around 7,500 ft . Its fall is protected by an automatic parachute . Dr. Goddard , who hates to stir up gaudy talk of moon flights , announces his present objective as reaching 50 miles into the stratosphere " to obtain meteorological , astronomical , magnetic and other data of altitudes greatly exceeding those which can be reached by balloon .
