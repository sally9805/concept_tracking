txt RULING CURBS EMPLOYMENT Compensation Charge for Logging Held to Be Too High . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have noted with interest Colonel Arthur Woods 's appeal to the 6,000 , - 000 farmers of this country to provide work for the idle . Here in Northern New York we are handicapped in this respect by a recently promulgated workmen 's compensation schedule , which , if not repealed , or changed in the near future , will make it impossible for most of the small employers to provide the necessary work . I refer to the minimum charge of approximately $300 on logging and lumbering . Almost the only way in which farmers and small capitalists can employ men in Winter is in woodland operations , cutting logs , pulpwood and cordwood . Under the new schedule , work of this character is at a standstill , and even our local laborers are without employment . If it had been the design of the promulgators of this regulation to bring hard times to the country , as well as the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible for us to give work of this character to men returning from the cities when we can not supply work even for those who reside with us . There is still almost as much cordwood burned for fuel in Northern New York as there is coal used for heating and cooking purposes , because the use of wood in many places is more economical than the use of coal . If the higher-priced coal must be substituted , an additional expense will be put upon the users in this section , who are least able to meet increased costs . Thus the new regulation has the doubly unfortunate resuit of increasing expenses at the same time that it throws men out of employment . Similarily , there has been a prohibitive minimum charge put upon sawmills , which has resulted in the shutting down of the small local mills and the closing of the markets to farmers for the sale of logs from their wood lots . There is no outlet , therefore , for labor for cutting logs , pulpwood or cordwood , and no cheap source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for making the repairs to barns and buildings which Colonel Woods suggests . Among our farmers it is customary , when repairs or new buildings are decided upon , to cut the logs for the lumber from the farmer 's wood lot , and to draw these logs to the nearest sawmill and have them " custom sawed " at an expense of $8 or $10 per thousand feet , which is a wide saving over the $50 per thousand cost of imported lumber . What farmer is going to build or repair under such conditions ? I made a trip to Albany ten days ago and discussed this question with officers of the State Insurance Fund . They tell me that they do not like the situation any better than I do , and that there should be some other way of meeting it than by the present regulation . According to my understanding , the men responsible for this regulation are the members of the New York City Board , consisting of representatives of the various casualty companies and the State Supervisor . of Insurance . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardship that would result from their regulation , and the fact that this regulation will virtually destroy the chief source of Winter employment for ordinary labor in upState New York . I have no doubt that an increase in rates was warranted , at least to some extent , to properly cover the hazards of the occupation . My objection is solely to the minimum charge , which %mounts to a prohibition of ninetenths of this class of work in the rural districts , and thus produces absolute stagnation in the labor market , not to mention the increased cost of living put upon the entire community . The answer will be made that the farmer can cut and sell all the wood and logs he cuts by his own labor without paying the minimum charge . Also that he can cut for his own use . But this answer is worthless in view r , f the situation . A farmer cannct employ a laborer to , cut one log or cord of v .. cod for sale , oxf  --  ept at a risk he will not undertake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found in every hamlet , which pay as much as $100 a year in premiums under the old regulations . Such mills find more than their profit taken up by the new regulation and therefore are obliged to shut down . No doubt , from the underwriters ' experience , the regulation was warranted . But unless it is changed , it will mean the most serious blow to the effort to create employment which has yet been given to this section . JOHN B. BURNHAM . Essex , N. Y. , Dec. 24. 1930 . Senator Norris 's Economics . To the Editor of The New York Times : I read with interest THE TIMES dispatch about Senator Norris 's criticism of Henry L. Doherty 's party for the social debut of his daughter . Senator Norris did not seem to realize that the greatest and quickest way to eliminate the unemployed is to employ and thereby put money in circulation , and there is no better way than by social entertainment to distribute money quickly into numerous channels and cover many lines of employment . A general idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their new wearing apparel , which must have employed many hands in the garment trade ; the numerous taxis , chauffeurs , decorators , caterers , food distributers , printers , &c.; In other words , it took a great deal of money out of the pockets of Mr. Doherty and his guests and distributed it to many trades . Using Senator Norris 's reasoning . it would be better not to build automobiles or anything in the luxury class or have factory payrolls because of the " ruthless scattering of money " during a time of bread lines , and it would be best to close all the factories and places of employment and make every one unemployed so as to show a false sympathy for the present unemployed .
