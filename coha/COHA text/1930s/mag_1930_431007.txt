On MILLIONS of household appliances , utensils , and equipment sole throughout the country , there is symbol which answers for women many of the questions that would ordinarily come into their minds in purchasing . This symbol is the Seal of Approval of Goo ( Housekeeping Institute . The seal is the means by which manufacturers make known to prospective purchasers that thei products have been Tested and Approved b . Good Housekeeping Institute . Women have come to know , through period of more than twenty years , that the Seal of Approval is trustworthy and reli able . They realize that it is awarded onlyy after comprehensive tests made by this Institute , and that it can be applied only . to those products which have met this Institute 's standards in all respects . The Institute 's tests on the basis o which the Seal of Approval is awarded an made both from the standpoint of the engineer and from the standpoint of the women who are going to use the product The engineer determines whether the product is well-made , of good materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its use of fuel o power . The women members of the Insti tute Staff use the product just as it with be used in the home , and with the woman 's point of view they make their decision as to whether the product does satisfactorily the work for which it is intended . When a woman purchases a product carrying the Institute seal , she knows that the product has been subjected to tests to determine important things in which she is interested , but which she could not find out for herself ? at least , before having made her purchase , and oftentimes not after . For example , when she purchases a range bearing the seal , she is assured that it will be a " good baker . " In other words , the heat distribution in the oven will be good and satisfactory temperatures will be maintained . She knows that the oven linings are made of sufficiently heavy material and that the general construction of the range is satisfactory from the standpoint of safety and lasting qualities .

This certificate licenses him to use the Seal of Approval on his product or in his literature describing or advertising the product . The manufacturer realizes that purchasers want to know whether or not his product has been approved by the Institute , and so he uses our seal of approval . From women themselves , from manufacturers and from retailers we know that prospective purchasers look for our Seal of Approval . If it is not present , they frequently write us to ask if the product has been approved .

Testing procedures have been standardized , and the results of our tests definitely indicate whether or not a product should be approved . The purpose of the Institute 's testing service is to establish lists of products to serve as buying guides to women .

" In it are indices showing manufacturers ' names , trade names of their products , and classified lists which make it easy to find any type of equipment or any particular device in which the prospective purchaser may be interested .
