W ELL , as they used to say in the big reform-lug scene at the end of the fifth act , now we  --  we in the Lindberghian sense  --  had to start life all over again . The credit famine that had busted us was over , we had strong backing from our old friends , Klaw &; Erlanger , and the effect of war profits was already vaguely visible in odd corners . Boom times , flush times , heavy-spending times showed signs of coming  --  not necessarily good times to my way of thinking as I look back . Like all the other sheep , we did n't suspect a single one of the miserable things that the war would bring in its train . We just went sailing down the wind , wit hout even bothering to hire a crystal gazer to read the future . Lord , I wish we had ! But then again , maybe it was just as well we were n't aware that the world was cracking up under us like the one-hors shay . It was like what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family brought . to New York from Chillicothe along with the old phaeton and a couple of dozen aristocratic chickens when they came East to live with me . At home George had always been just the pattern of probity  --  passed the plate in church , always did the family marketing and accounted for every cent . For a long while he went along just the same in New York  --  only he did his marketing on Amsterdam Avenue instead of Main Street . But after two years of resisting the numbers racket and other new influences , he disappeared one day with eighteen dollars of housekeeping money and never did come back . Prosperity had got him , that was all . Come to think of it , that tale 's a little too apt for comfort . Somebody disappeared with all the money about four years ago , and he is n't back yet either . As will happen when you begin again , even with the best intentions , the first thing we did was put our foot in it  --  largely my own private doing too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a handsaw  --  for the benefit of the younger generation , that 's a line from Hamlet  --  our feet would have stayed out of places where they had no business . Because there was already plenty of excitement about the war , the omens ! Oohed pretty good for a war play called Moloch that Holbrook Blinn had brought me to look over . Theatrically speaking , Moloch was beyond reproaeh  --  timely as tomorrow morning 's newspaper , tremendously grim and gripping  --  arid with a tine role for Blinn . But its central idea was too subtle for me . I could n't quite make out what it was getting at . I 've never been a pacifist  --  anything but  --  and I could n't get rid of a sneaking suspicion that this Moloch was the kind of pacifistic propaganda that I would n't be caught dead with . So I looked round for expert advice , which led me to send the script to Col. Theodore Roosevelt and ask for his opinion of its content . That would settle it one way or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just leaving on a four weeks ' fishing trip  --  would read it immediately he got back . In the meantime , Blinn and Mr. Manger , who looked at the thing simply as a rattling good play , objected to waiting a month for his verdict and insisted I put Moloch right into rehearsal . Time was flying , and as yet we 'd done nothing since the smash . And then , just when we were irrevocably committed to the production , the four weeks were up and here , on the dot , was Colonel Roosevelt 's answer written in his own hand : SAGAMOIIE HILL , Oct. 1st , 1915 . Dear Mr. Tyler : I have carefully read through the play , which I now return . As I told you , my criticism is worthless as regards technical matters . Nor can I tell what the people will like . But I can tell what I believe is wrong to teach the people , whether they like it or not . This seems to me to be a play that shows real strength . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crazed servant murders the young invading officer , and is herself silo. , the house burned , and the family turned into the streets  --  I could not speak too highly of the . /Bsehylean horror and dignity of the portrayal of the blind working of fate which brings evil on evil , visiting the wronged one and the wrongdoer with the same impartial and fearful severity . But taken as a whole the play seems to be designed to teach a lesson . At any rate , it will assuredly be accepted as teaching a lesson . This teaching I regard as both very foolish and very wicked ; for ICentinurd on Page 28.0 ( Continued from Page 26 ) the lesson clearly inculcated is ( hut ear , without regard to its object and spirit. , is the worst of evils , and that it is our duty to cultivate cowardice by insisting on the horror and suffering inevitably attendant on war , as on the work of the deep-sea fishing trade . of the life saving coast service , the fire department , the police department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often does , mean the only possible expression of the heroism that exalts humanity . Of course if the play merely means that an exceptional family may suffer exceptional horrors in war wantonly waged , and yet may possess such exceptional folly as to be willing and anxious immediately to go into another wanton and foolish war ; why of course such exceptional families doubtless exist , just as there are exceptional families which having butchered one child by folly or cruelty then proceed to butcher another ; just as there are exceptional surgeons so clumsy and heartless that they are responsible for repeated instances of hideous suffering and death . But if more than this is meant , then the play is as vicious and fundamentally false as one designed to show that all family life should be forbidden because there are , unfortunately , very many brutal husbands and fathers , and all surgery stopped because some surgeons are reckless and cruel . This play by inference condemns just as much war waged by a Lincoln or a Washington , for the highest good of mankind , as war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sehm II for the ruin of humanity . To fail to insist on the contrast between , to imply any kinship between , such wars is highly immoral , and profoundly silly , and puts a premium on sheer cowardice and selfish love of ease and shirking of duty  --  for these are precisely the motives to which the professional pacifists appeal , and the kind of soul spirit which they produce . This play would be accepted as teaching that war waged by Germany with frightful outrage to conquer and keep Belgium and war waged by the despairing Belgians to defend their land , their wives and children , both stand on the same plane . Such teaching is abhorrent , alike from the standpoint of morality and from the standpoint of common sense . The essential folly of the motif of the play is shown by the sudden apostrophe to the " Longue to Enforce World Peace , " at the end . Does not the writer know that such a League will be worthless until and unless those going into i1 for good purposes are thoroly prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigantic scale for the immediate benefit of others ? I favor such a plan ; but no man has the right to do so ; he earns utter derision by doing so , unless at this moment , as prerequisite , he is urging this nation to prepare in thorogoing fashion , and , under the Hague Conventions , to interfere , if necessary by war , for the Belgians . If such a League had been in existence last year it would probably not have averted the war ; but it would certainly have required the United States to enter the war . Such a League abolishes neutrality ; and the alternative to neutrality is actual or possible war . A wanton or iniquitous war is the greatest possible crime against mankind . The great wars for righteousness have marked the greatest stepping stones in the advance of mankind . In the game manner , Peace may mean a tremendous advance for righteousness , or it may mean ( as in the Roman Empire ) the rotting out of decency and manliness . It is wicked not to make these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was Almost Welcome T HERE was a pretty kettle of fish ? I 'd gone and done just what I least wanted to  --  like an abolitionist finding he 'd produced a red-hot pro-slavery play  --  and I 'd have given my back teeth to be out of it . But I could n't close the thing down , lose all that money for Mr. Erlanger , throw all those actors out of a job , because I 'd been persuaded into jumping the gun against my better judgment . I would n't have been allowed to wait anyway . I had my punishment in the ordeal of writing Colonel Roosevelt and explaining just why I 'd seen fit to go on without waiting for his advice after I 'd asked for it . For a while , too , I was afraid Moloch was going to succeed . Before coining to New York it played Powers Theater in Chicago , the most prominent . house in town , but of shaky , old-fashioned wooden construction . There was a big battle scene in the play ; and when the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they jarred every seat in the house and sent electric shocks up the audience 's spines . Tremendous realistic effect  --  people came out of it white as a sheet and it bade fair to make Moloch a sensation . But , fortunately , when we came into New York we played the New Amsterdam , a concrete-built house that an earthquake could n't jar , so the machine guns were about as exciting as.130 - malty Chinese firecrackers . Besides , the whole thing was ungodly depressing and , in the actual playing , so pacifistic that even I could n't have missed the point  --  in the proof of the pudding the audiences did n't like it much more than Colonel Roosevelt had , and Moloch and thirty thousand dollars faded away under us . I was considerably relieved . It was the only time in my career that . I was more than willing to see one of our plays starve to death . Well , we could hardly do worse again  --  the chances were we 'd do better . I 'd already opened negotiations with Laurette Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' My Heart , in London , suggesting that she might come home under our auspices . We 'd been good friends ever since her first considerable success in our Alias Jimmy Valentine . She asked me to come over and see her about it . I seldom needed any excuse at all for hopping a boat , war or not , so I sailed immediately on the Lusitania . Why not ? How was I to know it was the last eastern crossing she 'd ever complete ? People were babbling about submarines , of course , but nobody really believed in them , not even the Germans , I think , and the notion of a great liner like the Lusitania being in danger was just ridiculous . I came back on her , too , staying in London just a week to settle matters with Miss Taylor . I was on board when she made port the last time  --  it was queer and far from comfortable to think of But that 's a sad subject . I 'd better get back to the sequence of events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fingers with Moloch , we went clear to the other extreme with a dramatization of Pollyanna , following the depths of hysterical pessimism with the frantic optimism of the Glad Girl . Pollyanna was already a proverb and an amazing best seller  --  part of the public was doing its best to guy the poor girl to death  --  but it was only a small part of the public ; and everybody else , whole families at once , trooped to see her on the stage and just wallowed in it . We didn't. burn our fingers that trip , financially speaking . Pollyanna had already made its author a fortune  --  now it made us another , set us right up in the world  --  and then made still another for Mary Pickford . in pictures . We 'd figured we had something in Pollyanna and did our level best to treat the little lady handsomely . Patricia Collinge did the title role , with support from people like Philip Merivale and Herbert Keleeyand Effie Shannon  --  that cast would have been worth seeing in a Sunday-school pageant  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstate who 'd come to New York to do something about it , played his first professional role in it at forty dollars a week . Finding him would have been worth the whole thing . And the best of all reasons for feeling that it was n't quite as ridiculous as it may well have been , Pollyanna discovered that genius , Helen Hayes , for us . We 'd decided to put out a second company to get the road business while it was hot . Finding a second Pollyanna as good as Pat Collinge  --  that role was no snap , if you stop to figure it out  --  promised to be a real job . But when Helen Hayes and her mother walked into our office , it was like rolling of a log . She was so electric that in three seconds I 'd taken in her sensitive voice and uncannily quick gestures and made up my mind . She 'd been a child act Tess years before , but I 'd never heard of her . We paid her a hundred a week , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her happy on tour . We gave her all the trimmings of a star  --  private drawing-room , special hotels , flowers , the whole works  --  anything and everything to keep her from getting restless . For years afterward she was part and parcel of some of our finest things . How she did rehearse even then ! No point in finishing any instructions you gave her  --  before you 'd halfway finished she 'd caught , the idea and knew it better than you did , We could see right away that she was one of the two or three finest of her time . But we could n't know she was going to be absolutely great  --  and that 's only a fair description of a five-foot actress who tam make a triumph out of playing Mary Queen of Stets , who was six foot one . Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Stars T HAT was an era of discoveries . They got in your hair , there were so many of them , all these brilliant young people popping up from nowhere . We followed Pollyanna with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Lusitania bore highly satisfactory fruit. ? The Harp of Life and Out There and Happiness , written specially for her by her husband , J. Hartley Manners grand plays that gave her unquestioned genius every opportunity to blaze up . I always ' misted that Maimers try to work into each play a story for her to tell , for Laurette Taylor could held an audience tense through a long story better than anybody since James A. Herne  --  that was her specialty , like O'Neill 's staircases . Why , I wits so happy to he associated with her that I waived movie and stock rights on Manners ' plays , which cost me a fortune . And just to make it even better , she brought with her from England a startlingly capable beginner named Lynn Fontanne  --  shy and awkward  --  always turned in her toes , and a bad time we had breaking her of it  --  but through all her shyness you could see she , too , was blessed with absolute genius . Af ter all , I may have had to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have now heard of Lynn Fontanne , And then we got The Country Cousin by asking Tarkinglon and Julian Street to put a girl in the same situation as The Man From Home and letting nature take its course . After a good deal of agony and rewriting and a preliminary failure , it turned into a huge success , with Alexandra Carlisle  --  au English girl who spoke American , brought back from England for the lead  --  and Colonel Roosevelt making a speech from his box at the New York opening . Ile absent-mindedly forgot all about his friend Tarkington and praised Street to the skies as sole author  --  Street was in the box with him  --  which occasioned a good deal of skylarking afterward . Well , anyway , a minor member of that cast was Genevieve Tobin , also a former child actress , making her first bow in long skirts . What 's more , at the beginning of the second season , Miss Carlisle dug up what she said was a likely prospect in a young man named Alfred Lunt . We put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so impressed as we were when Tarkington happened to see him and wired us : " On your life do n't let go of him . I 'd like to try writing a play for him . " That was the genesis of Clarence and also the beginning of Lunt 's tremendous career . And it was when we cast Jeanne Eagels as the adventuress in Alexander Hamilton with Arliss that she started on her way to glory as a specialist in that kind of role . It Never Can Happen Again G OLLY , what youngsters they were , taking to acting like ducks to water , bright and keen and a joy to play with . Why , when we took a stock company to Washington , summer of 1918 , to play tryouts at a hundred in the shade , the only well-known member of the company was Emily Stevens  --  hut the others were Alfred Lunt , Lynn Fontanne , Helen Hayes , Sidney Toler , Cornelia Otis Skinner and Glenn Hunter . I 'd like to see even Hollywood , which has had the all-star-cast bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have guessed , sight unseen , that there was a good deal in a daughter of Otis Skinner 's , but the rest were just bolts from the blue . They were n't stars  --  but when they were through with us , they were going to be . Still those were wartimes , and neither the theater nor anything else could go on its way regardless , especially after America got into the war , where , according to some of us , she should have been long before . There was n't a department of life that the war did n't touch . Things happened after I discovered one night that Laurette Taylor was figuring on doing something to raise funds for the Red Cross  --  one of the few times I ever saw her overwhelmingly serious . Out of that bee in her bonnet ' lame the great all-star tour of Out There which raised $683,248 in twenty-three performances . Tackle that with cube root or calculus or trigonometry and it 's still an all-time world 's box-office record . In the best . days of the nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we finally worked it out , it was a magnificent scheme . In Out There we already had an appro-priate war play of self-sacrifice although it was n't exactly fitted for all-star casting  --  Manners had written it specially for Miss Taylor as a one-role job . But the minute I broached the idea to the biggest names of the stage , they dropped everything  --  some of them were right in the middle of important pro-ductions  --  and said sure , we 'll be right along , no matter how small the part . I 've put together a lot of all-star casts in my time , but only an earthquake like the war could have thrown that lot together ? just Laurette Taylor , George M. Cohan , Mrs. Fiske , Chauncey Oloott , George Arliss , James T. Powers , H. B. Warner , Julia Arthur , James K. Hackett , 0 . P. Reggie , George MacFarlane , Beryl Mercer , with Lynn Fontanne and Catherine Proctor for understudies , Lillian Russell , Burr McIntosh , David Warfield and De Wolf Hopper for auctioneers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lump they 'd have cost forty thousand dollars a week . But they asked no salary , paid their own expenses , the theaters asked no rent , royalties werewaived  --  every cent taken in went right where it did the most good . The auctioneers were the keystone of the struc-ture . Hopper went ahead into each town we played and auctioned the seats off in advance . And then , after every performance , McIntosh , who had previ-ously been making a great hit with Liberty Loan speeches , auctioned oft a program autographed by all the stars in the company and whatever notables were present , which was always a money-maker . After we hit on the grand system  --  suggested by Ja-cob Wertheimer , a theater owner  --  of making each bidder contribute the amount of his raise instead of the whole sum , it turned into a real gold mine . Mc-Intosh had a bad leg that made it necessary for him , to work on crutches , but that could n't stop him . But it 's incredible how hard we had to fight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had indorsed us all right , but that did n't make us very welcome to some of the local committees  --  they were afraid that our sensa-tional arrival would cramp the style of Mrs. Vhosit 's Red Cross Tea or some-thing  --  and it often took some tall battling to get even perfunctory coopera-tion . Things like objecting to the " undignified " pre-liminary auction and re-fusing to help on local ad-vertising because they were afraid they would n't get the money back . That sort of monkey business started right . away in Washington , our first stand . McIntosh was n't , allowed to auc-tioneer  --  they wanted some local light  --  so the program went . for a measly one thousand dollars ? and that was bid by Nora Bayes , an actress herself , which was a scandal . For an hour or two it looked as if the profession would have to put up all the cash as well as give the show . The curtain was to rise at eight , to allow time for the auction , but the great American theatergoer would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the only people downstairs were President and Mrs. Wilson in the stage box  --  they 'd had the courtesy to arrive on time . Still , the public in general was eager for a chance to be generous , and after Washington , money rolled in regardless . Our final performance in Pittsburgh netted one hundred and twenty-nine thousand dollars . That was one of the towns where the citizenry really got behind us . The total take would have been over a million if we 'd had the same cooperation everywhere . Putting George Arliss on the Spot I T WAS enough to makea saint swear . But this aggregation of genius on the loose skylarked from one end of the route to the other . When wartime congestion held up our scenery till 9:30 , the night we played Philadelphia , the east turned to and put on an old-time variety show which was , if anything , more of a hit than Out There or the auction either . Harassing George Anise was the favorite sport throughout  --  Arliss always checked up his props on the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book and the matches were just where he wanted them  --  and the others always sneaked on afterward and switehed them on him , which drove his orderly soul close to lunacy . That was largely Cohan 's doing  --  lie was the center of everything , variety show and all . McIntosh had developed a habit of putting himself and his sore leg to sleep with hollow groans every night , which kept Cohan and Steve Reardon , his companion , thoroughly awake in the next compartment . Finally , one night Cohan got up and went out to do something about it  --  and sure enough the groans stopped presently and here was Cohan getting sleepily back into bed . Reardon asked if he 'd cured the leg . No , says Cohan , it was n't the leg ; McIntosh owed twenty-five hundred dollars and was worried to death about how he could pay it . " Well ? " says Reardon . " Oh , sure , " says Cohan , " I gave him twenty-five hundred dollars . Now maybe we can get some sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was its bringing Mrs. Fiske closer to us . I 'd known her well a long time  --  and her husband gave me one of my first respectable jobs  --  but he and she always managed all her plays and nobody else got a look-in . Shortly after the Red Cross tour , though , she suggested to me a scheme for getting all the Barrymores and the Drews into a revival of The Rivals  --  a grand notion that did n't work out  --  but it did result in an agreement between Its . And then when Arthur Hopkins had a role in Madame Sand that nobody but Mrs. Fiske could play , we produced it jointly , starring her . Beli4e me , her name and ours on the same billing did look grand I It had been my lifelong ambition to work with her . And I mean lifelong . Why , the first time I saw Mrs. Fiske she was ten-year-old Minnie Maddern , playing Little Eva in a Tomshow in Chillicothe , and I was a stage-struck kid of eight passing programs to pay my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went that far back , but when I mentioned it to her once , she just smiled and said she was a little leggy for Eva at that time  --  maybe she was ; I did n't notice ; even at that tender age , I was pop-eyed with admiration . She loft the stage for a while after she married Harry Fiske . If she 'd never returned  --  and it would have been just her independence not to  --  the American theater would have been irreparably damaged . Nobody would ever have seen her Tess of the D'Urbervilles or her incomparable Becky Sharp in that grand dramatization of Vanity Fair that had Arliss as Lord Steyne and Maurice Barrymore  --  that 's right , . John 's father  --  as Rawdon Crawley . Lord , I wish we had productions like that nowadays ! She was a perfect performer . People used to complain , you know , that they could n't always understand her lines .

There is no point in being either optimistic or pessimistic  --  in hanging garlands or hanging crape . No one soberly asks for a riot of speculation except the few who know how to make the most of speculation . No one desires to have wealth redistributed in any such way that it will be taken from the thrifty and given to the speculators , with the poor staying exactly where they are now . No one desires to deepen ! he depression . But our course is headed directly into a speculation which must . be followed by a deepening of the depression . This comes at a time when every sign points to the fact that we are slowly recovering . Is it not the counsel of plain horse sense to take what is good and to avoid what is had ? If the country restricts its production while increasing the amount of its money , speculation in things made is inevitable  --  for there will be snore money than things . A sudden raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied know she often gabbled on purpose  --  when the lines were n't important  --  the pace of the play was her chief concern and if the house did n't get every word of " Wo n't you sit down ? " it did n't matter . But when there was a crucial situation or a brilliant line to handle , you could n't miss it  --  it knocked you way bark on your heels just the way she intended . That was acting  --  the kind of conscious skill that Jefferson had  --  and also dear May Irwin  --  the absolute , knowing efficiency of consummate art . The old theater had taught Mrs. Fiske to be a terrific worker as well  --  a few of the real old-timers still keep that tradition alive  --  but the new theater never heard of it .

Mrs. Fiske , although they 'd been in the same troupe for three weeks , which gives you an idea of how she kept to herself . You never knew how to reach her . Maybe she was down East on a farm  --  maybe in an upstate nunnery for absolute peace and quiet  --  maybe at her hotel  --  but it did you no good to phone . The clerk had apparently never heard of her ? that was orders , And you did n't hear of her either unless you wrote a note and got an answer .

Actors had always been my long suit , but I had never raised playwrights from pups before . It was well worth doing and very little trouble , because these playwrights were George Kaufman and Marc Connelly . ? Kaufman first swam into my ken when he was dramatic reporter on the New York Times and came in looking fur paragraphs  --  a shy , weedy youth that I took a great shine to . We had a play called Someone in the I louse that was n't shaping up right and Lynn Fontanne under contract , doing nothing  --  so I suggested to this bright young fellow that he might write a part for her into this play .

With my usual wt'ong-headedness , I held out for an experienced collaborator , if any , but Connelly was finally called in . The result was brilliant  --  even I could see that  --  but its apparent lack of plot worried me . It worried me right up to the opening in Indianapolis . But Tarkington was there , and after the first . performance he cornered me for a word to the wise  --  which was to give these boys their heads and let ' em write what they pleased just as they pleased .

I could see that after the second act , but Kaufman and Connelly , poor innocents , suffered right on . Lord , how // they did suffer ! All through the performance they were dodging miserably round in the lobby and out on the sidewalk , afraid to come in , telling each other it was a dismal failure , ducking every time they saw a member of the audience fifty feet away . Not . till it was all over could they be got to listen to the fits the audience were having and to believe that the thing had some chance . Queer things happened to the Kaufman-Connelly plays , Dulcy and To the Ladies  --  where Jean Dixon made her first stage appearance  --  and their dramatization of Harry Leon Wilson 's Mertou of the Movies . Tremendous hits in New York and a few big towns where they 'd at least heard of satire  --  but everywhere else the dear public was puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but any Lind of subtle satire was certain to miss fire . To them , Dulcy was just a crazy woman , and the authors ' picture of a banquet in To the Ladies could n't be funny because it . was just the kind of banquet they were accustomed to take seriously . Kaufman and Connelly could n't make it out . But I remembered things , such as what happened when Tarkington and Wilson satirized the small-town American abroad in The Man From Home and the audience took the dumb hero for a sort of Abraham Lincoln . Why , when he got up on his hind legs and said : " I 'd rather have our state insane asylum than the worst ruined ruin in Europe ! " they actually cheered him for his patriotism . Even so , I was n't prepared for the way movie stars took Merton of the Movies .

They were scrambling after their share of the artificial prosperity that began with the first munitions orders .

Big money , that fatal symptom , brought in a lot of fine little fellows , actors and managers both , that just did n't speak our language . And the more money poured in , the more violently Equity and the managers disagreed as to each other 's share of it , Still there was really no occasion for anything like a strike . Eventual agreement was a sure thing until an accident kicked over the lantern , like Mrs. O'Leary 's cow . You see , there was a big meeting of actors and managers at the Claridge  --  no friction beforehand : everybody chatting away like old pals  --  when , as I understood it , the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , " he says , grinning , " four years and a half ago we had to stand on the outside doormats of the managers ' offices with our hats in our hands . Well , it 's different now . " The moment the words were out of his mouth the fat was in the fire . Up jumped a couple of managers , mad as fury  --  the meeting broke up in a terrific row  --  Equity joined the American Federation of Labor to get support in the coming battle  --  which was the point where I and many others got disgusted  --  and in a few days the strike was on . The Footlight War Fortunately , it came early in the season , before it could ruin many new plays . We had nothing open at the time , but On the Hiring Line was scheduled for Chicago right away and Tillie was to reopen in Milwaukee the week after . We went right ahead  --  no teamsters and plumbers were going to tell us what to do  --  no , sir-ree ! Some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their places with people from the Actors ' Fidelity  --  the organization of people who did n't like the A. F. of L. development  --  a fine lot , too  --  Laura Hope Crews , McKay Morris , Sidney Toler for On the Hiring Line and Pat Collinge for Tillie  --  incidentally , young Elliott Nugent made his first appearance in that play . A plucky crew they had to be . When we got to Chicago , the unions flatly dared us to open . We talked it over with the big lawyer , Levi Mayer , assured ourselves that the Blackstone Hotel and Theater people were behind us , and got ready for war . The unions threatened to squelch us by cutting off the electricity , furnished through the hotel ; so we dug down forty feet in the basement , tapped the Chicago Edison main cable , and installed locomotive headlights in the gallery  --  just in case . Then I laid in a batch of private detectives  --  and a fine upstanding squad of professional strike breakers , all six foot three at least and game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good use of them . We had actors and a theater , but our scenery was still in the New York Central yards and not a truckman in town would touch it . The only transportation we could find  --  the only man in Chicago with the nerve to chance it  --  was is little consumptive Negro with a truck about half the right size . You should have seen thesis on their way to the yards  --  the truck bulging with gigantic bruisers all sworn in as deputies , and this little fellow coughing away , all hunched up on the driver 's seat . The union men had blocked the gates with their own trucks and dared us to come on . That was just what our heavy dragoons did . They landed on the union men like a regiment of wildcats , shot . their tires full of holes , pitched them out neck and crop  --  they enjoyed themselves something sinful while it lasted  --  and the little Negro and his battered old truck rolled through the gate like an army tank in high . E ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always came back for more  --  and always got it . By the night we opened , our troubles had drawn so much attention that . a prominent architect and an eminent labor arbitrator came down and volunteered to work in the stage-crew . By curtain time there must have been ten thousand people massed in the street to get in on the fireworks  --  news-reel cameras and everything  --  the unions ' threats had been getting fancier and fancier , you see . We did n't get much of an audience inside  --  receipts were less than one thousand dollars  --  but the gaps were pretty well filled by our private army , who were just itching for something to do . The tension was terrific , but the actors and the theater people were game as terriers . The unions let us alone that night  --  cold feet , I guess . But the tension was had medicine for a comedy . The audience were so keyed up that , although it was a good play , it did n't get any more laughs than the last act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for trouble that way , but we had the satisfaction of knowing that , of three productions that stayed open during the strike anywhere in the United States , two were ours . The third was Brady 's Nine Forty-Five in New York , with Brady acting in it himself in his own theater . That was where Brady had it over me  --  I was n't an actor . Professional First , ' V lighters A fat lot of good we did , though . Under the A. F. of L. 's wing Equity won that round  --  and the next round , too , five or six years later , largely because it 's impossible to get theatrical managers to hang together . The honest ones stick by their guns , but the chiselers just are n't made that way  --  they do n't know what an agreement means . That sort of thing makes you wonder sometimes how you can retain any affection for the modern theater  --  what there is left of it . The only way is to take it for the joke it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same kind of exasperation  --  if they were n't funny , you could n't resist the temptation to rip a shingle off the roof and warm their breeches for them . Like when we made the fatal mistake , some seven years ago , of booking our The Constant Nymph into a theater with a huge and well-warmed lobby . I should have known better at my time of life . The play had been a great success in London and our cast was first-rateBeatrix Thompson and Glenn Anders and Claude Raines  --  his first appearance here  --  but the lobby wreaked us . All the first-nig , hters ? thirty-six hundred dollars ' worth  --  could n't be budged out of the lobby at curtain time . They 'd come to be seen among those present , not to see a play at all . We begged , we pleaded ; finally , when the curtain was already up and the first act half finished , we turned the lobby lights black out . That gentle hint started them moving , but then they only spoiled things for everybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard them all telling one another the play was dull  --  they could n't understand what it was all about . Of course they could n't  --  what with standing in the lobby halfway through each act , they did n't see over a third of it . But they grumbled and grumbled and went away grumbling , and the play was sunk . Most professional first-nighters arowell , years ago we called them the THE SATURDAY death watch and they have n't changed much for the better . Critics usually mean well , but the results are often sad . For instance , we produced The Forty-Niners , a satirical revue , at the 49th Street Theater , with skits written by some of the cleverest people in New York  --  Kaufman , Connelly  --  it was their idea and a bright scheme if there ever was one  --  Heywood Broun , Ring Lardner , Robert Sherwood , Robert Benchley , Dorothy Parker . But half our authors were critics , too , and , just to show they were n't log-rolling for their own show , they ripped their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews and killed the show before it got going . If they 'd given us two weeks to chop and change it , we 'd have succeeded . Or else they 'll pull something like their reviews of our production of The Admirable Crichton . William Gillette was the original Crichton in America , but he never liked the role . Barrie wrote it to be played absolutely without humor , and the very twist of Gillette 's mouth made it impossible for him to keep a sardonic touch out of it . When Walter Hampden played it for us , he succeeded in being just as humorless as Barrie intended  --  a perfect job  --  but the critics , most of whom had been in knee pants when Gillette did it , said they sadly missed the indispensable humor that only William Gillette could give it . On the other hand , they behaved handsomely back when Booth Tarkington 's Clarence opened and proved to he one of our greatest successes . Broun and Woollcott , who 'd always maintained that Tarkington could n't write a play , wrote columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American comedy ever written  --  a tall order , but pretty accurate . And they rallied round again when , just a few years ago , we persuaded Mr. Gillette to return to the stage in Sherlock Holmes . They could hardly help that . It was n't just that Gillette 's performance was perfect  --  but , you see , he was Sherlock Holmes . Freddy Steele , who always drew the illustrations for the Holmes stories , had worked with Gillette dressing the character and always afterward drew the Gillette conception of it  --  so , when he walked on the stage , it was just as if he 'd stepped out of one of the books . It . did my heart good to see the kick modern audiences got out of that . When the Road Was Paved With Gold Our all-star-cast ventures during that period also did my very soul good . Some of our colleagues got their share of boomtime money by aiming sensation after sensation at the New York public and letting the road go to the movies or buy radio sets . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country a chance to see the rapidly vanishing elder geniuses again before they were all gone  --  Mrs. Fiske and John Drew and Margaret Anglin and Chauncey Olcott and Tom Wise and . Timmy Powers and De Wolf Hopper and Francis Wilson and Henry E. Dixey  --  we sent them on tour in the finest of the old plays , with the cream of the younger actors in support . These all-star Trelaw-ney of the Wells and The Rivals and Diplomacy and She Stoops to Conquer rolled up some of the highest grosses that any legitimate attractions over got . The biggest single week 's profit we made in thirty-five years came from She Stoops to Conquer in Philadelphia . All of them would hit forty thousand dollars a week now and again , just to show the Broadway // wise guys what an old masterpiece and an unparalleled cast could do for themselves . Trelawney , one of the lust and one of the best , is a good sample  --  any audience 's money 's worth for sure . . John Drew , Wilton Lackaye , Lawrance D'Orsay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John Kellerd , Eric Dressler , J. M. Kerrigan , Mrs. Thomas Whiffen  --  eighty years old she was , and keen as a girl  --  Helen Galtagan , Estelle Winwood , Pauline Lord , Peggy Wood , Henrietta Crosman , Effie Shannon  --  a cast like that in a classic of English comedy  --  that was the style we did things in . And yet along came a young woman from a Springfield , Illinois , paper interviewing Lackayeasked him to what. , Mr. Lackaye , do you attribute the amazing success of this production , please ? Lackaye gaped at her and thought , over that unprecedented list of names and said he attributed it to the sex appeal of Mrs. Thomas Whiffet . Well , the old Indy just never got over that . Mussolini Sets the Stage There was one all-star cast that never saw production , however  --  a scheme to bring the greatest . Italian actors to America in 1929 . But it did give me an opportunity to talk turkey with Benito Mussolini , and that was worth something , believe you me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Associated Press in Rome , knew I admired the premier and suggested that , if I wanted to meet him , it could be arranged . Well , I had nothing to say to the great man but how do you do , maybe , or why did you adopt the castor-oil cure , and that ' seemed sort of old stuff and rather pointless , so I declined with thanks . Even when Cortesi mentioned that Mussolini was thinking of sending a company of the greatest Italian actors on a good-will tour of America , I was still apathetic  --  my experience with actors that did n't play in English , even the greatest , like Dose and Mane , was fresh in my mind , and I couldn't. quite see myself saying no to Mussolini 's face . But then one day in Florence dear Leo Ditrichstein asked why I did n't take Zacconi , the dean of Italian actors , to America . I said Zacconi was far too old . " Very well , " says Leo , " I 'll have hint to lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this old fellow of seventy-odd jump out of his carriage light as a boy  --  after I talked with him and got the extraordinary vigor and vivaciousness of the man  --  I began to reconsider and wrote to Cortesi that a company headed by Zacconi might . bear talking over . Two days later a telegram summoned me to Rome for an audience with the premier in person . I needed some moral support the worst way , so I asked my friend Miss Gibson , an English girl who was teaching English to Mussolini and his daughter , to be on hand and help inc over the bumps . Mussolini had recently been shot at , but , to my amazement , his suite in the Chigi Palace was absolutely unguarded  --  only an old man to act as porter . In we went on the dot. , Miss Gibson and I. You 've probably heard that Mussolini 's office is the size of Madison Square Garden . Well , when you go in it seems a good deal bigger than that . He sits in the far corner at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the only other sticks of furniture in the place  --  and watches you as you march toward hint about a quarter of a mile , and by the time you get there he knows more about you than you do yourself . But then a child could probably have seen I was scared green . He came round the desk to receive us , very courteously , sat down about two feet from me , leaned forward and said : Now tell me all about it , " just like that . Well , in two seconds he 'd put me so thoroughly at my ease that during the whole interview I completely forgot to call him " Your Excellency " or anything else proper . He was so easy and democratic that I talked to him for half an hour as naturally as if he 'd been Charlie Dillingham . When we got down to brass tacks , I squared back and laid out my conditions without a qualm about dictating terms to the most powerful man in Europe : I wanted Zacconi instructed as to just . what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no after hitches , For publicity purposes and to forestall any anti-Fascist trouble in America , I wanted a big dinner given in Rome for Zacconi and the company , attended by royalty , the church and all the important dignitaries available  --  I demanded this and could n't do without that  --  and every time he nodded and said : " It shall be done . " Fortunately , his English was excel lent  --  maybe a little overcorrect , but anyway , a lot better than you and I speak  --  and every now and then he 'd glance at Miss Gibson after getting off some complicated idiom and say , without a trace of self-consciousness : " Am I right ? " and she 'd say : " Quite right , Your Excellency . " I had no idea of the crust I was showing until he asked me to have Zacconi report for instructions within forty-eight hours . I demurred . ' Zacconi was an old man , I said , and one hundred and fifty miles away  --  would n't a day or so later do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . " No , " he says , still not raising his voice , " Wednesday at 6:30 . " That woke me up . It was my turn to say : " It shall be done , " which I did with as much grace as my confusion allowed . Breaking the News to Il Duce When everything was arranged , however , Zanotti threw a monkey wrench into the machiuery . He was in Rome at 6:30 Wednesday right enough , but when he heard the scheme , he jumped his price so high and stuck to it so hard  --  he 'd retained his eye to the main chance along with his youthful spryness  --  that , after all , the thing was impossible . That was distressingly plain after I went to see him at his place in Viareggio on my way to Contrexeville to take a cure . Of course , I had to write to the Premier , giving him the whole story , and that promised to be not only a ticklish but a backbreaking job as well ; for nobody on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't an English stenographer with a typewriter available anywhere on my route between Viareggio and Paris . I was in a , fine stew over it when George Middleton arrived to try to sell me a play  --  bringing his typewriter with him like a good author . I sweated over that letter for days and Middleton typed it off for me , and then I sent it to Cortesi , asking him to give it to the Premier after he 'd read it and made sure it was all right . Back came his answer  --  the letter was all right and he 'd delivered it , but he 'd had to take the liberty of typing my name under my signature , so the Premier would know who the letter came from  --  and after Il Duce read it , he 'd said : " It 's just as well , // perhaps . Mr. Tyler would probably have lost a lot of money . " Well , I guess there 's no use going any farther after Mussolini . He 'd make most anything else an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of a tag line ? Why try ? It 'd be an antique by the time it got printed  --  and besides , George Kaufman says there are no more jokes , and he ought to know . However , I country . Indians knew how to camp . They did n't want nobody to know they had been there . " Entirely brazenly , Bret had even , for many years , taken a hand in the cultivation of the sweet-Williams and the Shasta daisies and the hop vines which decorated the grounds and wails of the Tumbling L Bar . Now he smiled back at Lister as grimly as Lister was smiling . " We 'll sure clean it up , " he said , " as soon as we 've had a cup of coffee . Here 's another thing , Jawn . Look at these . " He put his hand into one of the pockets of his overalls and drawing it out , held it , palm upward , toward Lister . Lister looked down and then up . " Well , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empty rifle shells These people are going hunting , and the season opens in a little over a week , and they 're practicing up . " Bret put his shells hack in his pocket . " They 're sure practicing up . They shot about a hundred shells at that cut bank over there , and then they shot at trees , and everything . And they had a slew of guns  --  a .33 and a .22 long , and a .35 , not to mention the .38 Colts and .4-1 's the boys was shooting . They must have been betting , and holding contests , and showing off left and right . As a rule , guides and horse wranglers do n't shoot their guns off much on a dude party . " " Maybe the Colts belonged to the dudes too . " " Maybe , but the second funny thing , Jawn , is that there 're no unexploded .38 's or .44 's lying about where there 're any number of .33 's and .35 's  --  everywhere . There 're no .22 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lister stared at Bret . " Unexploded shells ! What do you mean ? " " Unexploded shells . You 'll see ' em when you start to look around . It seems as if someone must have shot three or four times and then pumped ou t his magazine , either " ? Bret spoke with even more slowness than ' usual ? " through nervousness orabsent-mindedness , or  --  deliberate . " Lister smiled frowningly . " Deliberate ? Why deliberate ? What would be the sense to that ? " Bret shook his head . " I do n't know , unless it was to create the impression that everyone  --  guides , horse wranglers , cooks , everyone  --  was mighty careless with cartridges . But , you see , the boys was n't careless . They would n't be . Jawn , whoever was doing that knew a heap more about guns than he  --  or she  --  pretended . " His manner changed to one of decision . " Well , let 's grab that coffee . It 'll ho boiled over by now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in air as be jumped back , his eyes wide , his hand on the wooden grip of his revolver , which hung , tied by a rawhide thong , to his right leg . wonder if the dear public would take it personally if I borrowed one from an author who knew his business , although they say he 's a little old-fashioned now : " Lord , what fools these mortals be ! " Puck used to carry that line on its front page  --  and it would be a fine time of day if you ca n't take a joke as well as your elders and betters . Editor 's Note  --  This is the tart of o acne* of artmles by Mr. Tyler . In the warm silence there had been a muffled explosion . For a moment the two men remained motionless , then they turned their heads and stared at each other . Bret smiled crookedly . He did n't like to be startled unnecessarily , " That was n't no rifle shell , " he said . For a moment I thought someone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He and Lister went to the front of the tent and , thrusting their heads beyond the flaps , looked around . The camp was drowsy with sunlight . There was no sound except the small , perpetual wind in the pines and the buzzing of flies . A crow cawed . Bret strode out of the tent and down to where Lister had made his fire . Ho stared at the round , blackened spot , and then raised his head . " I thought so , " he said . " There 'll be no coffee , Jawn , unless you build another fire . And maybe we 'll have to get out the spare pot .. " He walked over to where the coffeepot lay , some four or five feet distant , and picked it up and examined it . " Ruined ! " he said . " All the bottom Mowed out . " He put the coffeepot down and came back to the fire and began to dig with a stick in the embers . " It was n't no shell , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if it had been , the bullet would have been right here in the coals . Besides , a shell dropped carelesslike would have exploded long before this . No , the fire 's blowed in all directions and there 's a hole in the ground . " He stood back . " It was something buried , " he said . " Something buried , and perhaps wrapped up too . And it was something pretty powerful . " " Why did n't it explode before ? " asked Lister . He was walking around the camp fire in a widening circle , his eyes on the ground . Every now and then lie stopped to pick something up . " Whoever done it , could n't have done it while the fire was lit , could he ? " said Bret . " He , or she , would have to wait his , or her , chance . Early in the morning , perhaps , when everyone was asleep , helped by a little water if the fire was hot . Those small fires would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the tip of a pine . " And then , when everything was all fixed and ready for the evening , the other party changed his , or her , mind , like this morning , and they broke camp and went on . " Bret looked at Lister . " A new camp , and after supper , would he the dangerous place , Jawn . Maybe a new fire . " Lister laughed . " We 're getting all worked up without much cause . Bret , " he said . " So you actually think someone did this on purpose ? " Bret pursed his mouth , but his eyes were grimly reflective . " I said ' maybe , ' " he retorted .
