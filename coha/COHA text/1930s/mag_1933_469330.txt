You sometimes hear an Englishman I say , " It is n't cricket , " and by that you know he is damning someone 's conduct . The American may ask , " Then what is cricket ? What is this game which has become proverbial ? Have we anything like it in the United States ? " Let the reader be assured at the outset that this article is not an exposition of that extraordinarily tedious game which takes two days to play and which , judged by its soporific effects upon the spectators , has in it the properties both of an aspirin tablet and a lullaby . I know very little about cricket and I have seen only two games in my life , with a lapse of nearly a quarter of a century between , so that I can fairly claim to view the proceedings with the eyes of an average American . The first game I saw bored me to death ; the second interested me intensely , for it gave me the challenge to find an American equivalent , something which holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decency of conduct in every walk of life . Whether a bone fide equivalent can he found in the United States I would rather leave the reader to say . If , however , after considering cricket as an institution , his reply should be that there is none , I would suggest that we may be on the eve of producing one ; for it is a significant fact that cricket came into being , as a national influence , at a crisis in English history when politicians and judges were corrupt , when moral standards were low , and when the country was overrun with highwaymen , bandits , and the spiritual ancestors of the racketeer . With that perspective before one 's eyes , cricket may take on a new and more interesting meaning . I was recently invited to attend my second game by a friend who called me up and said , " Have you ever seen a cricket match ? a real one ? " " Yes , " I replied . " I went to one in 1911 on a broiling hot day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours and a half , and we had to wait while the players had tea . " " Whom did you go with ? " he asked . " Another American . " " Did he know anything about the game ? " " No , it was my fault just as much as his . " " Oh , nonsense I " said my friend . " Come along with me and I 'll explain all the fine points . You 'll like it when you understand it . We ought to see some good cricket too . Hobbs is playing . " " Hobbs ? " " Yes , you know : the English Babe Ruth . " " Oh , yes , " I said , " I 've heard of him . " I considered the matter . My friend was a real cricket enthusiast , once a fine player himself , a member of the " Oval " where most of the important matches take place , and he was personally acquainted with many of the players . He was an insider . It might he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life but had never given serious consideration to this sport . There must , I thought , be something in a game which has so profound an effect on every class of society from bishops to blacksmiths , and which could contribute a phrase so significant in English speech . So I said I 'd go . At 11.30 a.m. we met at the Oval , which turned out actually to be an oval . I say actually because in England things are rarely what you expect them to be . Downs , for instance , are always the tops of hills ; places called Three Bridges usually have four ; Cirencester is pronounced in three different ways , each correct : and you can count dozens of oaks in Sevenoaks . However , you must n't lose the main idea of things by being fussy over details , because if you do you 'll just spoil the game ; and that is n't cricket . So when in England you just take things for granted or rejoice secretly that something has turned out to be as you expected it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found , not only that it really was an oval but that nearly everyone in it was half asleep . The players , all in white , were standing about on the field , and I knew at once that the game was in full swing because practically no one moved . The grandstand , in which we occupied two of the best seats just near to the clubhouse door , was only about oneeighth filled , and that with middleaged and elderly barristers , parsons , country gentlemen , and persons of that description . A poor attendance , it would seem , but my friend told me that the crowd , including ladies , did n't usually come until the afternoon ; those who came in the morning were the real enthusiasts . The enthusiasts were slouching in their seats in various degrees of mental concentration , quite a few with binoculars ( though we were not really far from the players ) which were set in position as soon as the bowler started to wind up . Perhaps at this point it would not be out of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to an outsider ? especially as this article is intended for outsiders . To begin with , eleven men in white flannel trousers stand about on the field , almost never twice in the same place , and never symmetrically , perhaps because the English do not like symmetry . There are two batsmen in at a time ; you see them facing each other in the center of the field . The bowler stands about eight yards back of what we would call his " box " and begins running towards the batsman , and by the time he reaches his box he has swung his arm in a circle , like a windmill with only one wing , and sent the ball towards the batsman who touches it indifferently , almost negligently , on the bound so that it rolls a few feet to one side . He does n't run . No one moves except someone who picks up the ball and throws it back to the bowler , who walks patiently to his first position and begins the process over again . This happens half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowler has got tired of being thus trifled with , and has told another player to have a shot at it . Someone else then bowls , in an opposite direction and to the other batsman , though the first batsman never ! eaves his place . Again the same thing : wind up ? windmill ? pfti ? and the ball roils dead . It is very neatly and perfectly done . Everything is perfect , indeed , including the silence , but no one yet has really moved except the bowler and the enthusiasts who lift and lower their binoculars in unison . At last one batsman gives the ball a short , sharp crack , sending it between two fielders , and he runs . The opposite batsman runs too , and they change places . Thereupon the operator of the score board sets down his cup of tea and records the fact that this particular batsman has increased his score from 87 to 88 , amid the resounding applause of three or four unbridled enthusiasts who let go their binoculars and clap their hands . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " Probably not till after lunch , " my companion replied . " Perhaps not till after tea . Would you like a cushion to sit on ? " Foreseeing discomforts if I refused , I said " yes , " and we rented a couple from a boy who , by the way , had no other palliatives to offer , such as cigars , cigarettes , sandwiches , ginger ale , or candy . We were there to see a game , not to eat . II Can this , a stranger would ask , after he had sat there for an hour or so , can this game , tedious and dragging as it is , however skilfully it may be played , be truly representative of English character ? of the whole of English character ? He would be constrained to answer " no " ; for at football games and other sports in England you can witness as much speed and action and screaming enthusiasm as could be exhibited by any group of American collegians . Nor must it be forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have held recent speed records in the air , on the water , and on land . At the automobile show in London could be seen , two years ago , three peculiar-looking objects which were , at that time , the fastest airplane , the fastest motor boat , and the fastest racing car in the world ? all English from stem to stern . For twenty years or so the Mauretania held the record for transatlantic speed , and England can boast of the fastest regular train service in the world , a sample of it being shown recently at the Chicago Exhibition . All of which would lead to the conclusion that the English are not slow when they feel like speeding up ? that they are only slow when they want to be . I would suggest that there is a good deal of significance attached to the italicized words , because they indicate an element of control in social life which is extremely wholesome . Is it not the very thing which we ourselves need ? Every contrivance for locomotion should be equipped with brakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same case , a fact which the English , through centuries of experience , have found out . As they have learned to put the engine where it belongs and the brakes where they belong , so under proper circumstances do they let themselves go ; and they enjoy those moments of abandon all the more because they know that somewhere in their midst is a weightier counterpart ? flywheel , governor , brakes , or what you will ? to balance . Every school , as any headmaster will tell you , must allot some place in which the boys can romp and blow off steam , but it would not do to let sweet abandon run wild in every quarter ; there should be at least one room ? library , drawing-room , or chapel , perhaps ? in which restraint and dignity reign and bestow their approval , as it were , upon the hilarity of other spheres . Boys instinctively recognize the value of this and they even like it ; and the more they recognize it the more will they carry a measure of that restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , to the American spectator at a cricket match that this game is the flywheel or governor of English sport , a kind of standard according to the spirit of which other sports are attuned . I say spirit advisedly , not rules , because that thing which is cricket ? I mean the very essence of it ? can not be put into rules . Moreover , the English do n't like rules : they prefer standards ? practical , working standards which they can see with their own eyes . And standards they have many , for in England you may look into almost any department of life and you 'll be pretty sure to find at least one unit there towering above all the others as a standard of high quality . The Rolls Royce , for instance , in the field of motor manufacture ; the London Times in journalism , or Punch among the comics ; the country squire , as a pattern of rural public spirit ; Harley Street doctors ; heads of the large joint-stock banks ; judges , and those at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in politics , in the professions there is always a small group at the top by whose standards the conduct of others is rated . You may not own a Rolls Royce nor read the Times , and you may be bored ? as many an Englishman is. - by cricket , but you are constrained to recognize the value of these various standards as practical influences for good . For example , I was held up at a street crossing once by a policeman who asked me why I had n't signalled that I wanted to drive straight ahead . I said I did n't know it was necessary to signal unless you wanted to turn right or left . He replied that it was necessary and added , " Rule or no rule , would n't it be more courteous to me and to the other drivers if you did ? " He was right , and I was wrong , not because I had broken a rule but for the reason that I had failed to live up to a standard . But where did that cop get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far wrong , I think , to say that he got it from one of those models aforementioned , and very likely from cricket . These institutions then , taken together , are what may be termed the higher conscience of the Englishman , and cricket might he defined as that part of his conscience which is deliberately and systematically handed down to the young . Whatever dross may exist in the lower strata of business , of journalism or sport , whatever derelictions of moral conduct the Englishman may permit himself or countenance in his neighbor , he will tolerate no tampering with the ideal , no trickery on the part of those in places of high responsibility . High standards are the life-preservers of society ; they keep people 's heads above water when strength or spirits flag or when confusion sets in and , therefore , it is important that those life-preservers be kept in good condition . So come what may , " England yet shall stand " so long as she has the London Times , incorruptible judges , and Bass ' Ale . But just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so a pair of white flannel trousers can not make a cricketer ; for cricket is not a sport but a spirit . Likewise a match at the Oval is not a game but a ceremony . The solemnity , the measured tread of the proceedings , the conventional and dignified attire of the players ( imagine cricket played in " shorts " I ) , the absence of cheering , ballyhoo , and whoopee have this effect upon the spectators and contestants alike ; and as I sat there beside my friend I felt that if I had leaped to my feet and shouted , " Come on , Big Boy , sock one into the bleachers ! " I should have been summarily fined for contempt of court or ex-communicated . It would have been too much like flicking pebbles at the archbishop 's nose . So I sat quietly and waited for Hobbs ? and lunch . III Thanks to my companion , by the time we went in to lunch I knew a lot about cricket . I could tell you what was a leg-before-wicket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a lot of other funny things . I was becoming one of the enthusiasts . In respect of the cold meat and boiled potatoes which constituted our lunch , I was not so enthusiastic , but over a glass of beer my friend let up on technicalities and told me something about the players themselves . It would appear that they are divided into two classes called " gentlemen " and " players , " the distinction being that the former play for fun while the latter are paid for exactly the same fun . Among the gentlemen there may occasionally pop up some member of the titled nobility ; but no man , either gentleman or player , has a ghost of a chance of representing his county unless his general character is deemed to warrant such representation ? his character , please note , not his social position ; for there is nothing snobbish about cricket . Thus the game is kept clean and uncommercial in every respect , and even betting is not permitted . There is a news ticker in the clubhouse which records the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but above the ticker is a solemn notice to the effect that no betting in respect of these sports is permitted in the clubhouse . In this way the atmosphere which surrounds cricket is uncontaminated by any suggestion of gambling ; and indeed I believe it when they tell me that no one does gamble on cricket , either professional or amateur . There are plenty of other things you can bet on if you want to . So there comes to the spectator the realization that there is something hallowed , almost sacrosanct about cricket ; and the explanation of this lies , I would suggest , in the fact that this game is not only an ideal , but that it is the putting into actual practice of that ideal . It is thus not a conception which is well-nigh unattainable ? such as the religious conception of perfect Christian conduct : on the contrary , it is one which can be attained , and actually is attained . In that there is some resemblance between the cricket match and the medieval tournament or joust in which the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . Those knights who rode into the lists were ? for the moment , at least ? the personification of everything which the feudal system considered fine : strength , bravery , and courtesy ; and the flower which each warrior wore in his helmet was a declaration that he fought not for himself , but in behalf of some fair lady who , by virtue of that symbol , had dubbed him her knight . Every age , every civilization , indeed , has its model of conduct , whether it be knighthood , sainthood , Bushido , or the go-getter . What , after all , is the history of ethics except an account of these ideal types ? Depict the type and you have described the ethical conceptions of the people . It is these personifications of ideas , not the ideas alone , which have so great an influence on people 's minds , for actions always speak louder than words ; and those persons who do things , who offer themselves as patterns of conduct for others to act upon , have a more beneficent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? upon society than those who merely think and write . Here , parenthetically , I should say that cricket among amateurs and schoolboys is not nearly so tedious an affair as it is among the crack players ; a good game can be played in an afternoon , and no end of fun derived from it . I mention this to dispel any idea that schoolboys are forced to play cricket ; they're'not forced : they like it . Think , then , of the moral effect upon boys ? young hero-worshippers that they are ? of taking part in a game from which all petty disputes , tricks , and animosities have , by tradition , been eliminated , a game in which the idea is not merely to win and play well , but to hold your tongue and keep your temper no matter what happens , and under all circumstances to show that your gentlemanly self is not going to be turned into someone else 's goat . As it is essential to practice batting to become a good batsman , so is it equally essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this game offers an excellent opportunity . As soon as the boys put on those white flannel trousers they are dressed , not merely to play a certain game but to behave in a certain way . Consequently there is no trying to rattle the pitcher ? or bowler , in this case ? no loudly voiced opinions on the other man 's playing , no slamming down of the bat as a protest against a doubtful decision ; for to dispute a decision of the umpire is as unthinkable in cricket as to stand up in church and contradict the preacher in his pulpit . If players did that sort of thing the game would cease , by definition , to be cricket . IV We finished our lunch and found that the crowd had begun to gather and ? shall we say ? ? blossom with the presence of the fair sex . Soon the players strolled out onto the field , and when they seemed to have got more or less into their proper positions , I listened for the umpire to call out " Play Ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Righto , carry onl " or whatever signal may be the conventional one by which to start off ; but no such signal was given . The men just gradually wandered into the game , as an improvising musician will modulate into the proper key and be playing a tune before you know it . The same side was in at bat ; for with these crack players it takes a long time to get a man out , and the whole team bats before the sides change . Well , about fifteen minutes after they had resumed play something happened which really made the game worth seeing . One of the batters ? or batsmen , I should say ? must have felt the stimulating effects of that cold beef and boiled potatoes , for he swung back his bat and gave the ball a wallop that sent it whizzing to the very uttermost parts of the field and started every pair of white flannels moving too . For about forty-five seconds the spectacle closely resembled that of a baseball game as far as agitation and excitement were concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that very moment and was able fully to appreciate the skill with which the batsman had picked out the ball and sent it exactly to the spot where he wished it to go . It was superb . " By Jove ! " I cried , in good English parlance , " That was jolly well worth seeing , what ? " I turned to my companion , feeling that a new bond of interest had sprung up between us , but he had missed the play entirely ; he was asleep . I left my companion to his dreams and , returning to my own thoughts , recalled the sentiments of a gardener to whom I had once talked on the subject of cricket , asking him whether the game was to his liking or no . He replied that those high-falutin ' matches at the Oval were all very well , but for himself he preferred watching a game on the village green where the big fat pub keeper runs to catch a ball and gets it squarely in the belly instead . That , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is more fun , but the point not to be missed is this , that an exhibition of cricket on the village green , while in technical skill not to be compared to that seen at the Oval , and while displaying a good deal more jollity , kidding , and horse play , is exactly the same when measured by the spirit in which it is played ; for the blacksmith 's second assistant conducts himself just as much like a gentleman as any titled player . Nor is there any self-consciousness about this on the village green ; the ethical conduct of the players is taken for granted , and if there is one place where you do n't hear the comment , " It is n't cricket , " that place is the cricket field . When the Duke of Wellington said that the battle of Waterloo was won on the cricket fields of Eton he did not mean that every man in the British Army was a graduate of that school ; if such had been the case his declaration would have been relatively uninteresting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Eton that the statement is significant , and indicates the tremendous and far-reaching effect of a game serving as a channel through which to convey the spirit of self-discipline , steadiness , and pull-together into every rank and file of society . Well , at last someone got out and it was the turn of the great Hobbs to bat . Following the custom of the game , he did not appear until the retiring batsman had got into the clubhouse , and then rose from a seat a little behind us ? he had been sitting there all the while ? and , bat in hand , walked slowly down the aisle and out onto the field . Heads turned and hands clapped as he went by , but so did they in the case of the batsman who had just retired . You could not help but like the look of Hobbs . He is a man of about fifty , wiry , not tall , slow rather than quick in motion , a pleasant , kindly looking man , and , I should like to bet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have entered the field by coming up out of the ground instead of walking through a crowd of people . He went slowly to his place on the field and took up his position . From a spectacular point of view you would be disappointed in him as a batsman , for he does not , like Babe Ruth , knock ' em cock-eyed for a homer , but deftly taps the ball first to one side then the other , piling up the runs thereby bit by bit . It takes a practiced eye , plus binoculars I should say , to appreciate his skill , so for the visiting spectator the score board must tell the story . Yet I was glad to have seen Hobbs , for he seemed to represent the best in this important game . At the same time that he earns his living by playing cricket ? and salaries are not large ? he sets a high example in sportsmanship and in the quiet dignity of his private life . He has the same sort of influence , I imagine , on the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is very doubtful if he could have exactly the same influence if he were an aviator or even a tennis champion instead of a cricketer . At the beginning of this article it was mentioned that cricket first took hold upon the imagination of the English at a time when their country was politically and socially corrupt and when speculation , bandits , and highwaymen were running a gay race to see which could wreck the country first . It is hard to imagine sedate , law-abiding England , where one 's person and property are so unusually safe , where there are no such things as automobile locks , and where not a single policeman , even in the worst parts of London , carries a revolver ? it is hard to imagine that this country was at one time in no better case than our own at the present moment . Yet it was . That the English people got themselves out of this mess is a creditable fact , but I would not imply that they did so simply by playing cricket . That game was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent the storm outside , you could retreat ; we , anyhow , said the cricketers , will keep ourselves decent and play the game fairly . And gradually , in the " new deal " which the country was then giving itself , the influence of those men began to tell . It was a **25;1197;TOOLONG era , and the people found a slogan for the new spirit , not in politics or business or from the military , but in a game . But why a game ? Perhaps for the reason that a game , in itself , is not an important issue , the winning or losing of it not a vital matter . The ups and downs of a game affect a person 's pride more than anything else , and pride , being an exceedingly inflammable and unstable thing , is all the more necessary to control . You do n't lose your temper over defeat in battle or when the market goes down or Congress does something stupid ; but if you 're called " out " when you know you 're " safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that angry protests are going to do far more to spoil the game than an occasional error on the part of the umpire . In England , then , it was at the end of those years of corruption ? not during them , note ? that people sought for something which would embody and express their new conception of honor and decency , and they found it in cricket . The parallel situation in America can not but catch the attention . Our attempt to sweep away racketeers , corrupt politicians and judges , and to inject a new morale into the arteries of business is analogous to the evolution through which our mother country was passing at the very time when we were born . It is distinctly a moral movement , a proclamation , on the part of the people , of the marriage banns between ethics and business . But if the Blue Eagle is the marriage license , where is the pattern of fidelity ? Where is the slogan we want ? In the " new deal " Mr. Roosevelt has borrowed one from the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the good neighbor , " from our homely conceptions of friendship and honest dealing . The first is entirely non-ethical , the implication being that it leaves things to chance ; the second , splendid so far asit goes ; but the bad neighbor is , alas , often as prosperous and happy as the good one . It is unfortunate that no slogan can be borrowed from sport , for when sport is at its best a man simply can not be a good player unless he subordinates his own desires to the interests of all concerned ? otherwise , he is literally a spoil-sport . That , I take it , is the sentiment Mr. Roosevelt wants us to catch hold of . But where , in sport , can he find the slogan he wants ? " Play ball " does not fill the bill ; it means , rather , " quit fussing and fooling round and pay attention to what we 're doing . " " Play the game " comes nearer , but specifies no particular game and might be taken as meaning poker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , that we lack an institution in America similar to cricket in England , and we need it . We need it , not for the purpose of reforming our moral conscience , but because our moral conscience is being reformed and , therefore , seeks expression , As an idea is more exchangeable if it possesses a name , so is an ideal if it has an exponent , and the real value of cricket in England is that it fulfills these two desiderata . To import the game , however , into this country would he palpably absurd , and to pass a law reforming and remodelling baseball equally futile . No custom was ever given a name until it had already existed in people 's minds ; it was never invented , like printing or the electric lamp . In the same manner sentiments can not be foisted on a people who are not in a mood to receive them ; and in that respect it may be recalled how in the early days of the Volstead regime certain ardent prohibitionists offered a prize to the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which would turn the wicked drinker black in the face with shame . Someone coined the word " scofflaw " which was chosen because it had a nice hissing sound ; but , like the little fire-cracker that it was it went " ftzl " and died away . We did n't want it , we wanted drink instead and we had drink , and now it would seem we are thirsting for righteousness and shall very soon be in search of an institution to foster it and contain it ? something real , human , and practical . We are , like the English , a sport-loving people as contrasted , for instance , with the Continental or Oriental races . Our newspapers devote a great amount of space to the account of games and we are used to borrowing phrases from the lingo of sport , like " right off the bat " or " right from the word go " or " he 's in the ring now " or " that 's a knock out . " We even speak of business as a game : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For that reason there is a likelihood that our new conceptions of the moral law may be embodied in a game . But what game ? Certainly no one would want to prophesy , nor do I. All we have a right to say is that this game should embody two essentially important features : one , that it be played by groups of players , teams ; and the other , that it can be indulged in by middle-aged , even elderly persons . The value of the first of these two is self-evident ; the second deserves perhaps a word of consideration . A game in which adults as well as younger persons can participate is naturally shared by a greater proportion of the population , and gains in dignity by the very participation of those older persons . The association of youth with age in sport , or the mere watching of elderly people playing , has a very salutary effect upon the young point of view ; for age has less of that impatient , high-pressure desire to win , and is more inclined to play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , age can yet appreciate skill quite as much as youth . I remember a joke in Punch which depicted an octogenarian glaring furiously at a youth who was bowling atrociously , and saying , " Oh to be sixty again ! I 'd show ' em ! " Football and baseball unfortunately are games too strenuous for elderly people to play , though the latter might be modified , and indeed is , to suit the approach of arterio-sclerosis . Possibly , then , baseball may be our game , for it is a fairly old institution and has , therefore , the advantage , if not the dignity , of age ; and every agency of control in society must have the prestige of years . But it must be painfully evident to everyone that no sport , in the public and professional exhibitions of which there can be whispers and suspicions of " throwing the game " can ever exercise a wholesome effect upon the people of that country in which it is a national institution . If men who play in the World 's Series throw games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And if he does it on the field , why not in the office as well when he becomes a man ? It would be safer , therefore , to let Time point out to us what will be the outward expression of our new conscience rather than to attempt a prophecy ; because , after all , it makes no difference what the medium of expression is as long as it be suitable and expedient . So we should do well to watch for it and boost it when it comes along . I can not help wondering , however , what the ideal sportsman of our near future will be like , and I venture to say he may be something of a cross between Bill Tilden and Bobby Jones , combining the zip and go of Tilden with the reliability , steadiness , and personal modesty of Jones . It is an unfortunate and perhaps significant fact that each of those men is a star in a game where group play has no place . The ideal sportsman of our near future must be . then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . I say this because I was much impressed when leaving the Oval by a portrait which hung in the principal room of the clubhouse ; a lifesize portrait which , while it was the likeness of an actual player , since deceased , might be offered as the ideal type . It is of a man of about thirtyfive or forty , and you see him , in batsman 's rig , slowly descending the stairs of the clubhouse , drawing on his gloves in preparation to take his place at bat . In addition to a certain athletic grace in this figure , you are struck by the fact that it is the personification of poise , dignity , fairness , and gentlemanly bearing . This is not only a cricketer but a man who sees that the game of life is worth playing , and all the more so when played in a fair and friendly spirit . One could as easily imagine him " throwing " a game as throwing loaded dice for copper coins , and a sense of humor glimmering about the eyes assures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the artist in this case did not miss his opportunity , for at the foot of the stairs and a little to one side he has portrayed a youth looking up at this player as he comes out to play the game . That , I thought , is what they mean , when they say " cricket . " But what equivalent have we ?
