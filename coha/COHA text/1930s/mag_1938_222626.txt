A blanket decree signed by Dictator Joseph Stalin last week ordered corrected some abuses typical in Soviet collective farming which have been fully described by Soviet officials who have fled Russia , have never been mentioned by dispatches from Moscow . Promptly the New York Times , which has been growing more &; more aroused at the difficulty of getting straight news out of the Soviet Union , editorialized last week : " Once more the outside world learns what has been happening in Russia only when a Government decree stops or reverses a Government policy . The present edict forbidding further expulsions of farmers from collective farms is like a searchlight thrown backward over a dark road . It admits that expulsions were carried out on a large scale by ' callous and arbitrary ' party functionaries , that the majority of these expulsions were unjustified , and that families were driven from the farms when the fathers had been recruited by State agents to take temporary jobs in industry . <P> " It admits further that the measures taken have broken up many collective farms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants must end . Stalin orders , and by his order illuminates the lot of the poor muzhik under a gigantic trial- &-error; system that , from his point of view , supported by periodic turnarounds in the Kremlin , seems to be mostly error . <P> " First there was the wholesale liquidation of peasants in the process of collectivization of the land . Now it is revealed that collectivization did not render the peasant secure ; he is still being purged . No wonder , as the new decree reveals , that ' this artificially creates discontent and wrath and makes many collective farmers uncertain of their position . ' No wonder , despite all the discriminations against them , that individual farmers are described as having advantages over many collective farmers . Henceforth it is ordered that members of the collectives must receive at least 60% of the money income of the enterprise . All this reveals more than the lot of the peasant ; it suggests his widespread and dangerous dissatisfaction with his lot . " <P> Censors permitted to pass the estimate of Izvestia , official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year to the extent of sowing only 35,463,792 acres up to last week whereas the State had ordered them to sow by then 48,705,881 acres . Thus far , according to Izvestia , 17% of the total sowing scheduled for this spring has been done . Thus , despite all censorship , the main fact came out that Dictator Stalin , having suddenly realized how much trouble is up , has leaped in with concessions which he hopes will persuade the peasantry to start sowing seed full blast this spring , before it is too late .
