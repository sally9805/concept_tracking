Last week the Army and the airmail finally parted ways when the last route ( Chicago-Pembina , N. Dak. ) was taken over by Hanford Tri-State Air Lines . Meanwhile in Washington Congress was putting the finishing touches to the new Air Mail Law before sending it on to the White House . The act establishes a 6 airmail postage rate , provides one-year mail contracts with rates to be fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission ( maximum 40 per airplane mile ) , prohibits interlocking directorates and holding companies , limits each contractor to one primary and two secondary routes , permits carriers whose contracts were canceled to sue for damages through the Court of Claims , and authorizes a committee of five to complete an aviation survey by next February . The temporary contracts now in effect probably will be extended to the end of the year .
