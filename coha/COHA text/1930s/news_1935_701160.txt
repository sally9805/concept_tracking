txt A change in policy , away from restriction of agricultural production and toward expansion of foreign and domestic markets , is foreshadowed by an amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act , introduced by Representative Marvin Jones ( Dem. , Texas ) The proposal is now before the House agricultural committee , along with the Administration 's AAA amendments . The Administration is quite apparently attempting to save its processing tax cotton loan program from attacks upon it . Pressed by the New England mills President Roosevelt last Wednesday ordered a Tariff Commission investigation of the effect of textile imports on American producers . Friday he announced a sweeping study of the whole situation in the cotton textile industry , centering particular attention on obsolescence in American mills . It is doubtful if the Administration move will stall off the attacks and one AAA officials has admitted that " some of these days " the organization is going to have to take definite steps to dispose of the cotton piling up under the government 12 cent loan program . Provisions which would enable it to do just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would Foster Exports These would include the provisions sponsored by Chairman Jones . which would make available to the Secretary of Agriculture 307 of gross customs receipts each year . to be used to encourage exports of agricultural commodities by payment of benefits or making up indemnities or losses . The money , Chairman Jones indicated , could be paid either to exporters to make up losses , or to producers in the form of benefit payments on the portion of their crop normally consumed domestically . AAA. officials also state that they could use the money to take over the cotton under loan and export it at the world price . The new program is not intended to replace the present processing tax-benefit payment system , Chairman Jones stated , but is intended to supplement it . A definite change of policy is foreshadowed in the wording of the new amendment , however . The word " reduction " is stricken out wherever it appears and the word " adjustment " inserted . Also the Secretary of Agriculture , is enjoined to spend the money made available to him " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land which can be profitable cultivated and with the most rapid expansion of exportation of agricultural commodities . " Chairman Jones predicted that anywhere from a hundred million to a hundred and sixty million dollars would be available each year from the customs receipts provisions of the bill . He stated that several times during the past year , offers to buy cotton have been received by this government , particularly from the Far East , which had to be rejected because of a comparatively small price difference . Program Under Fire The AAA program as a whole has come under heavy fire from many sources recently . especially because of its scarcity economics . It may be that a shift toward increasing acreage and encouraging exports will be the Administration 's answer . Non-farm groups are agitating for repeal of the processing taxes , although Senators opposing the tax have admitted that in the face of the President 's opposition , and the strength of the farm bloc in Congress which is supporting the tax , such a move will be impossible for some time . Drought in the Southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year is often disastrous . Although AAA officials claim that farmers are still highly satisfied with the AAA , the Administration has fallen far short of a bringing about the promised " parity prices " to farmers . The purpose of the Agricultural Adjustment Act was " to establish and maintain such balance between the production and consumption of agricultural commodities , and such marketing conditions therefor , as will reestablish prices to farmers at a level that will give agricultural commodities a purchasing power with respect to articles that farmers buy , equivalent to the purchasing power of agricultural commodities In the base period . " The base period In the case of all commodities except tobacco is August 1909 to July 1914 , and in the case of tobacco . , August 1919 to July 1929 . Since the act was enacted on May 12 , 1933 , 31.317.350,457 has been made available to the Agricultural Adjustment Administration by the Treasury . Of this total . ** was made available in anticipation of processing tax collections , while 3732.000,000 has so far flowed into the Treasury from tax collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outright to the AAA . Of the total amount made available , the AAA has spent $887.500,000 . Roughly $631. - 000.000 has been paid to farmers for plowing under 10,400.000 acres of growing cotton in the spring of 1933. killing 6,200,000 little pigs and 200,000 sows in the fall of 1933 , and agreeing to grow 40% less cotton , 15% less wheat , 20% less corn , 25- ; fewer hogs , and varying percentages for tobacco in 1934 . Ad ' istrative Costa Buying up and removing surpluses of the various commodities has cost 3215,000,000 while administrative expenses have been 342,000,000 . These programs raised the purchasing power of farmers from 67,7 ' , of the established parity on May 15 , 1933 , when the act was passed , to 68% on May 15. a year later . Owing chiefly to a disastrous drought in the summer of 1934. which decreased cattle numbers by 7,600.000 head and bog numbers by over 20.000.000 head , the largest reductions for one year ever known , the purchasing power index rose from 68 on May an , 1934 to 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on February 15 , 1935 . Even the highest livestock prices since 1930 were not enough to hold the index at this level , however , and on March 15 , 1935 , farmer purchasing power fell back to 84% . When the Agricultural Act was passed , agricultural exports were already much below the pre-war level , due to foreign exchange restrictions . tariffs and the fact that after the war the ' United States bad changed from a debtor to a creditor nation . Since passage of the act . exports continued to dwindle , the most striking decline taking place in cotton . During the month of February . 1935 , the index of agricultural exports stood at 50 , just one-half the pre-war level . Excluding cotton , the index stood at only 39 of pre-war compared with 63 in February , 1934 . The index for cotton itself stood at 58% of pre-war , the lowest Feoruary index since 1923 . During the eight months ended February 28. 1935. the United States exported only 3.733,000 bales , a decrease of 44% in volume from the corresposjing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse criticism on account of the drop in exports of pork products and cereals , many persons have put the blame for loss on cotton exports on the AAA. cotton reduction program and the 12-cent loan . About the cotton situation , the AAA has to date done nothing . in spite of the large amounts of cotton held by the government . Secretary Wallace has been forced by political pressure to announce that the loan will be continued on the 1935 crop . Pressure will also probably force a loan of 12 cents or close to it to be made . Lower Prides Expected Although the control programs for all the major commodities will be continued next year , AAA officials freely admit that no further improvement in farm prices can be expected as a result of the program . In fact , since restrictions In all commodities are less drastic than laid year the recent drop in farm prices is expected to continue In all commodities except livestock . As a result AAA candela are stressing more and more the need for improved business conditions as the only means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in the act . The future course of the AAA Is hard to plot . Some contend that pressure on President Roosevelt Will force aumpeailas of the processing taxes with the consequent degeneration of the program into a pure relief measure . el , e-ers predict that the AAA programs will gradaally be superseded by a general land buying program , the $950,000,000 of work fund money alloteed for a land program forming the basis for the shift . Secretary Wallace himself , sees as the AAA 's future function , the holding of the present gains in farm prices until industrial conditions improve generally and domestic tariffs are lowered enough to allow restoration of normal foreign trade .
