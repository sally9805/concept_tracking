President Roosevelt started it . In Hyde Park , where he had gone to vote , visit his mother , catch cold and be serenaded by shivering villagers after the Republicans swept the county , he told reporters what he thought of the transfer of U. S. ships to foreign flags . <P> From all over the U. S. echoes of protest rolled back to Hyde Park on the Hudson . No , said Senators Borah , Clark , Johnson , Wheeler , Minton , Schwellenbach , Pepper , Byrd , McNary , Taft , Nye ; no , said the Sailors ' Union of the Pacific . No , said Congressmen Bloom , Coffee of Washington , along with the Keep America out of War Congress , the National Maritime Union , and Columnists Krock , Denny , Flynn , Thompson , et al . No , said that old Border Statesman Cordell Hull of Pickett County , Tenn. , Secretary of State through the 2,445 days of the first two administrations of Franklin Delano Roosevelt . <P> What had the President said ? <P> Night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington announced its conditional approval of the transfer of eight ships of the United States Lines to the flag of the Republic of Panama . Banned from belligerent ports , banned from their regular North Atlantic runs because of the combat-areas provision of the Neutrality Act* , these vessels could travel to these ports under the Panama flag , could , moreover , carry arms . And although President Roosevelt announced he was holding up the transfer pending investigation , he expressed his opinion that the transfer did not violate the Neutrality Act because : 1 ) the U. S. would have no jurisdiction over the ships , and 2 ) they could not carry U. S. crews . <P> Border Statesman . Within one hour up spoke Secretary Hull in Washington to announce a contrary view . A quiet , softspoken , long-suffering ex-judge ( keeping close control over one of the hottest tempers in Washington ) , Cordell Hull 's difficulties have long provided left-wing New Dealers with some of their favorite and more malicious anecdotes . They like to tell about the time he was told of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure ' nough " and went on about his business . They tell of the time he spoke with quiet pride of his work as a reformer on the first modern U. S. income-tax bill back in 1913 , while his audience-national planners , currency tinkerers , spenders-lenders , rural resettlementers , court reorganizers-could hardly keep their faces straight . <P> Said the Secretary , disagreeing with his chief : when the Maritime Commission first approached him , he felt that no question of foreign policy was involved . Then he realized he had spoken hastily , believed all officials should join in preserving the absolute integrity of the Neutrality Act , advised the Commission that there should not be even the appearance of any official step or course that might negate that policy . <P> Next day reporters rushed to Secretary Hull 's regular press conference at 12:30 p. m . " Gentlemen , " said the Border Statesman , giving them a glacial stare , " I have nothing to say on the City of Flint or transference to the Panama flag . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
