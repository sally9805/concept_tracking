SCENE : A sitting room in a modest suite in the Hotel Roosevelt , New York City . On the right are windows . At the back , toward the right , is a bedroom door . Another bedroom door is at the left , downstage . Upstage , left , is another door leading to the small entrance hallway . The furnishings are standard : one overstuffed couch , toward the right , with standing lamp by it ; one easy chair , one somewhat less easy chair , and two or three small chairs that are n't easy at all . The writing desk with telephone is at the back . Between the two doors at the left is a radio cabinet . It is about six o'clock in the evening . The month is September and the year is 1930 . A WAITER and BUS-BOY are arranging a dinner table in the centre , fussing with the vast array of covered dishes , coffee pots , etc. , which make of " room service " the problem that it is . MRS . KRULL is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , formidable  --  the wife of a veteran Senator and herself a power of no mean proportions in the D. A. R. , the W. C. T. U. , the National Federation of Women 's Clubs , and Washington Society . She delivers almost every speech with the positive assurance of a 9.2-inch howitzer . She is wearing a dressing gown . MRS . KRULL ( complaint in her voice ) I told them I wanted the steak rare . ( The WAITER produces the largest covered dish from the hot cabinet and shows its contents to MRS . KRULL. ) p. 3 WAITER It is rare , madame . You will see . ( MRS . KRULL takes up a fork and , bending forward ever so slightly , gives the steak a poke . ) MRS . KRULL ( not quite convinced ) I 'm sure it 's very nice . And the pie ? WAITER Oh , yes MRS . KRULL What do you mean , " Oh , yes " ! Is it cold or is it hot ? WAITER Hot , madame . As you ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it steams . MRS . KRULL Well that 's all right then . ( The BUS-BOY wheels the hot cabinet out of the door , upstage , left . ) WAITER And is that all , madame ? MRS . KRULL I believe it is . WAITER Then if I call back in maybe a half hour ? MRS . KRULL Yes . I imagine that will do . WAITER Thank you , madame . ( He gives one last , loving look at the display of electroplated ware and goes out . MRS . KRULL goes to the bedroom door , upstage , right , and opens it. ) p. 4 MRS . KRULL The supper 's here , Harvey . ( SENATOR KRULL 'S booming voice is heard to reply : " Be right out . " MRS . KRULL then crosses to the other bedroom door and opens it . ) MRS . KRULL ( in the doorway ) Not ready yet ? ( The only response is a murmur of some kind from the bathroom . MRS . KRULL goes on into the room . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the bathtub . Well  --  if you want to eat supper with your father , you 'd better come on . ( She has returned , and terminates her own speech by shutting the door , with some emphasis . ) ( SENATOR KRULL comes in from the bedroom at the back . He is a big , imposing man , with a square face , a New Willard hair-cut , and shoulders that are perfectly designed for the support of a toga . He is wearing black dress trousers , with belt ; a pleated dress shirt ; a turned-down collar with wide black bow tie ; and no coat or waistcoat . He is groping his way through the excessive pages of the New York Sun . He goes to the table and sits down , still turning page after page of the newspaper , evidently annoyed at his inability to find what he is looking for . MRS . KRULL sits down opposite him , but she is not partaking of the repast. ) p. 5 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You ca n't find anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , New York  --  and its filthy rackets . To look at this paper you 'd think the rest of the country does n't exist  --  and then they talk about provincialism . Oh ! Here it is  --  and on page ( he looks at the top of the page ) page 16 ! And only that much . ( He holds his thumb and fore-finger about three inches apart to inform his wife . ) That much , on page 16 , to announce my arrival in this city . That will give you a notion of what New York thinks of South Dakota . MRS . KRULL I 'm sure South Dakota is very glad indeed to return the compliment . ( She has poured the coffee for him and hands him the cup . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( having read the brief notice ) Here  --  want to see what it says ? ( He hands her the paper . She reads the item , then lays the paper , neatly folded , on the table . KRULL immediately starts to attack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . ) Can you believe it , this steak is actually rare ! MRS . KRULL I know . I told them . And the pie is nice and warm . p. 6 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Where 's Emmy ? MRS . KRULL I just called her . She was taking a bath . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Taking a bath ? I thought she was n't going out anywhere . MRS . KRULL She said she was n't . But anyway , she had to have a bath , and a cigarette while she 's at it , too . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Well , there 's certainly no harm in having cleanly habits . But her supper 'll get cold . Emmy ! ( There is no response . The telephone rings . ) You better take it . If it 's for me , see who it is . ( MRS . KRULL goes to the telephone . ) MRS . KRULL Hello . Yes . Oh , just one moment . Just hold the line . ( To KRULL . ) It 's somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displeased ) Oh ! What paper is it ? MRS . KRULL What paper do you represent ? It 's The Evening Telegram . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL The Telegram . Oh , yes  --  that 's one of the Scripps-Howard group . They 're all right . p. 7 MRS . KRULL He 's downstairs in the lobby . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I 'll see him . MRS . KRULL The Senator says you may come right up . Yes . ( She hangs up . ) You 'd better have your coat on . I 'll get it . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Thanks , honey . ( She goes out . KRULL sees The Sun folded so as to show the notice devoted to the news of his arrival . He carefully refolds the paper so that the front page is again in front . MRS . KRULL returns with his dinner coat and waistcoat . ) MRS . KRULL I 'll finish dressing while you 're talking to him . And do n't let him keep you too long , because we 'll have to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . ( He is putting his coat and waistcoat on before a mirror . MRS . KRULL , on the way out , pauses . ) MRS . KRULL Harvey SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Well ? MRS . KRULL It just happened to occur to me . This Telegram newspaper is n't one of the filthy scandal sheets , is it ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I told you it 's one of the Scripps-Howard chain , did n't I ? They 've got papers , good papers , in a lot of different cities all over the Middle West . p. 8 MRS . KRULL Well  --  just be careful to see that he adheres strictly to national affairs in this interview . If he should happen to ask you anything about her. ( With a glance toward the left . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( back at the steak ) I think I can assure you that twenty years of experience have fitted me to hold my own with newspaper men . ( There is a knock from the corridor at the left . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course  --  if you can find out anything SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I 'll find it out . Come in ! ( MRS . KRULL goes out at the back , as the outer door opens and HAUSER comes in . HAUSER is a thin , studious and patently weary reporter , with horn-rimmed glasses and an expression in which are mingled in almost equal proportions discreet deference and wholesome contempt . ) HAUSER Good evening , Senator . I must apologize for bothering you . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL That 's all right , my friend . Sit down , and fire away  --  if you do n't mind watching me eat my supper . Will you have anything yourself ? p. 9 HAUSER Why , thank you , I SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Cup of coffee , toast ? ( He indicates the array of dishes . ) HAUSER No , I do n't believe so , thanks . But are n't you going to the banquet , Senator ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I am . But this is my meal , right here . Confidentially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HAUSER That 's a fine idea . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I ca n't speak on an empty stomach . And if you rely on what they give you at these affairs , you go hungry . I mean to say  --  they stick a dried chicken wing in front of you , and before you have a chance to pick at even that , the waiter sneaks up on you and the next thing you know , the bird has flown . ( He chuckles . ) HAUSER Oh , that 's very funny . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Well , what can I do for you ? HAUSER Hauser is my name , Senator . I 'm from the New York Evening Telegram . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL One of the Scripps-Howard group , is n't it ? HAUSER Yes , sir  --  that 's right . p. 10 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Roy Howard is a good friend of mine . A very able man . HAUSER Yes . How long are you going to be with us in New York , Senator ? SENATOR HARVEY L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just came up from Washington , stopping over here solely for this banquet to-night . To-morrow morning we go on to Boston to participate in the D. A. R. pilgrimage to the shrines at Lexington and Concord . Mrs. Krull , as you doubtless know , is one of the officers of the D. A. R. After that we 're going home , to South Dakota , to get busy on the campaign . HAUSER Is your daughter accompanying you ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL She is . Did you wish to ask me anything about my speech to-night ? HAUSER Oh , no , Senator . We have a copy in the office , all set up . What I was particularly anxious to talk to you about was something special , a sort of unique idea , of our own . We 're about to run a series of feature stories on the question , " Should New York Secede from the Union ? " SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Oh ! ( An exclamation of sarcasm . ) HAUSER Yes , Senator . You know what news is these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . p. 11 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL And you have to fill your first page somehow , eh ? Am I right about that ? HAUSER You 're entirely right . We 're getting statements on this question from a lot of leading national figures : Henry Ford , Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler , Ruth Hanna McCormick , Heywood Broun and we 'd like particularly to hear from you . As a distinguished member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , and with your reputation for vigorous and highly original opinions , we felt sure you 'd have something telling to say . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You want a comment . Very well : ( He wipes his mouth . ) I 'd consider the secession of New York City to be an unmitigated blessing . ( He says this with the air of one who is expressing a " vigorous and highly original opinion . " ) HAUSER A blessing for New York City ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL For the United States of America . HAUSER May we quote that ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take such action , and form a new , autonomous State , what do you believe the President would do ? Would he call out the military forces , as Lincoln did in ' 61 , or would he consent to accept the right of the people of this city to withdraw ? p. 12 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL The President would undoubtedly appoint a commission of inexperienced , ineffectual amateurs to investigate the matter . In other words , the President would have no idea what to do , and would compromise by doing nothing . HAUSER May we quote that also ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You certainly may . Though not as coming from me . HAUSER I see , Senator . Now , in the event of this hypothetical secession , what would be the reaction of the people out West , in your own constituency ? ( EMMA KRULL has come in from the left . She is just under twenty years of age , clean , candid and alluring . She is a great problem to her parents . She is wearing a rather masculine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mules . When she sees HAUSER , she pauses momentarily in her advance toward the table . ) EMMA KRULL Oh . ( She is not startled , merely mildly surprised . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You go back to your room . EMMA KRULL I thought dinner was ready . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I 'll send yours in . You go on , now . This gentleman is from the press and we 're busy . p. 13 EMMA KRULL Oh , a newspaper man . Well , in that case , you 'll forgive me , wo n't you ? ( She goes to the table and starts lifting lids . ) Which is my soup ? ( She finds the soup and starts ladling some out into a plate . ) Is there any toast ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL There it is . Come on now , Emma , you get back to your room . ( EMMA is having difficulty with the plates . ) EMMA KRULL ( to HAUSER ) Would you mind helping me with these ? HAUSER Why , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both hands . He takes the toast plate and the butter . ) EMMA KRULL Oh  --  and I forgot the celery . HAUSER I 'll get it . EMMA KRULL Sorry to have interrupted you , Pop . ( She goes out at the left , followed by HAUSER . Her voice is heard , offstage : " Put them down here . Thanks a lot . " ) ( The telephone rings . KRULL , irritated , answers it . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Who is it ? Yes . Oh , yes . Yes  --  come right up . Yes  --  1247 . ( He hangs up . HAUSER comes back . ) Will you kindly close that door ? ( HAUSER does so. ) p. 14 HAUSER Charming daughter you have there , Senator . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Yes , she 's well liked . HAUSER You 'll forgive me , Senator , for intruding on your privacy but is there any truth in the report of her engagement to Joseph Gresham , Jr. ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Where did you hear any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been printed . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL By some cheap scandal-monger . HAUSER Walter Winchell . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Do you happen to know him ? HAUSER I 've seen him around . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL He had no conceivable authority for the statement that my daughter and this young Gresham are  --  are to be HAUSER Sealed . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Whatever the vulgarism was . It came as a distinct surprise to Mrs. Krull and me , and , I might add , to our daughter . Where did the man get such a notion ? HAUSER I 'm afraid it 's a rather obvious one . Your daughter and Mr. Gresham have been friends for some time . At least , the rotogravure sections have been full of p. 15 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL There 's been too much publicity . HAUSER It 's inevitable , Senator . They both come from prominent families . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL My daughter engages in many social activities in Washington and in Virginia . She is a keen horse-woman , and has mingled with a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Gresham happens to be one of them . He is an acquaintance of hers  --  one of many , in fact . That is all . HAUSER But Winchell is generally right , Senator . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I am expressing no opinion on his veraciousness . I am only telling you that this time he has been misinformed . HAUSER I see . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL What do you know about this young Gresham ? HAUSER Just what everyone knows . He 's the son of Joseph K. Gresham , and the grandson of old Peter Gresham , and SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL What 's his reputation around here ? HAUSER He 's recognized as what they call an ardent sportsman  --  polo , racing , and all the rest . If there 's any more specialized information you 'd like to have , I might be able to look it up . p. 16 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I hardly think you need bother . ( There is a knock on the door . ) Come in . ( MR . MURCHARD comes in . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. manner and faultless evening attire . He talks with extraordinary rapidity . ) MR . MURCHARD Senator Krull . ( He gives KRULL a manly hand-clasp . ) I 'm George Murchard , secretary of the committee on arrangements for this evening . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( heartily ) Good evening , Mr. Murchard ! MR . MURCHARD The committee has asked me to come and SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( turning to HAUSER ) I 'm afraid I 'll have to call the interview at an end . HAUSER Certainly , Senator . ( He gets up . ) It was very good of you to SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Do n't mention it . HAUSER I understand that we 're running an editorial on your speech in the paper to-morrow afternoon . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I wo n't be here to see it . Good evening . p. 17 HAUSER Good evening . MR . MURCHARD ( politely ) Good evening . ( HAUSER has gone . ) Well , Senator , the committee wished me to express to you some measure of our  --  our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to do all in my power to facilitate in any possible way SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Have a seat . MR . MURCHARD Thank you  --  I 'm not going to keep you a moment . Now  --  we 've arranged for a nationwide hook-up on the Blue Chain , N. B. C.  --  that 'll be handled out in South Dakota from Station KPKH , Sioux Falls . The banquet broadcast will commence at 9 P.M. They 've promised to have Louis Bettaver on the mike , so you can rest assured that the announcing will be well taken care of . We 're figuring that you 'll go on the air shortly before 10 P.M. at the latest . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I assume that I will be the last speaker . MR . MURCHARD Needless to say , Senator , you 're the trump card on our little programme . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Who 's preceding me ? MR . MURCHARD ( taking out a typewritten sheet ) I 've brought the order with me . Let 's see  --  the first will be Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invocation . Then we 'll have a few remarks from the chairman  --  our president , Mr. Sorensen , of Spokane , whom you of course know . He will introduce Mr. Myron L. Maxwell of St. Paul , who will speak on the outlook in the Northwest from the investment banker 's angle . After him comes the celebrated humorist , Irving S. Cobb  --  and I think we can count on him for something facetious . ( With a deprecating laugh , expressive of MR . MURCHARD 'S opinion of facetiousness . ) And then Mr. Sorensen will call upon the assemblage to rise to the national anthem , following which you will speak . p. 18 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I think you 've got a well-balanced programme there . MR . MURCHARD ( with another deprecating laugh ) Well , I can tell you , Senator , our committee has put a lot of thought into it and plenty of good old-fashioned elbow grease , too . Now there 's one other little matter . ( He takes from his inside pocket a long envelope and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hand you this  --  thinking it might be  --  better  --  to have it out of the way beforehand . ( KRULL seems to be planning to open it , in evident doubt as to its contents . MURCHARD has wished to avoid actual mention of sordid subjects , but deems it necessary to explain . ) It 's the  --  check  --  the little matter of the  --  fee . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Oh  --  oh , yes . ( He puts the envelope in his pocket . ) MR . MURCHARD Now , Senator , if you 'll excuse me . I 'll be running on over to the hotel . There are a few last-minute loose ends to be gathered up , as you may imagine . By the way , the committee has been pleased to place a private car at the disposal of Mrs. Krull and yourself . It will be waiting down-stairs at the 45th Street entrance to take you right over to the Astor , where I will be waiting to meet you . p. 19 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can promise you a really intelligent and appreciative audience  --  all men and women from our own part of the country and proud of it ! SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL It 'll be a pleasure , I 'm sure . MR . MURCHARD Till seven-thirty , then . ( He accompanies this with another manly handclasp and goes out . KRULL goes to the door at the back , opens it , and calls " All right , honey . " Mrs. KRULL comes out . ) MRS . KRULL Well , what did that reporter say ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL He left . There was another man in here , from the banquet committee . He gave me the check . MRS . KRULL That 's good . But what about the reporter ? Did you find anything out ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL No  --  but we were right about what he came for . It was to pump me about Emmy . He started off with some cock-and-bull story about New York seceding , but he soon had the conversation steered around to this miserable rumor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARVEY L. KRULL Oh , he was guarded . But his very reluctance to say anything about Gresham 's reputation proves that we have grounds for suspicion . p. 20 MRS . KRULL So far as I 'm concerned , we do n't need any more information about him . Just to look at him is enough to know what he is . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL To look at him , and to hear that affected way he talks . I know when this started . It started when she began mixing herself up with that set at the British Embassy  --  that 's when . MRS . KRULL We 're not concerned now with how it started . What we 've got to face is how and when it is going to end . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We 've got to go carefully with her . She 's a self-willed little thing . MRS . KRULL She 's got to be made to understand the gravity of it . She must be told , and told definitely , what the results would be of any newspaper notoriety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . MRS . KRULL Very well , then . If you choose to shirk your responsibilities , then it 's up to me . It 's always up to me . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( thundering , as he crosses to the left ) Have I ever shirked my responsibilities ? MRS . KRULL You always do  --  where she 's concerned . ( KRULL opens the door of EMMA 'S bedroom. ) p. 21 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Emma ! ( EMMA 'S voice is heard to reply , " Yes , Pop ? " ) Come here ! MRS . KRULL What are you going to say ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You 'll see what I 'll ( EMMA comes in , eating a stalk of celery . ) EMMA KRULL Oh , he 's gone . ( She goes to the table and sits down to go on with her meal . ) Is n't it time for you to be leaving ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I suppose you know why that reporter came here ? EMMA KRULL Was it something about the tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . EMMA KRULL Me ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL He tried to get me to confirm the rumor of your engagement . EMMA KRULL What did you say to him ? MRS . KRULL What could your father say , when you 've persistently refused to take either him or me into your confidence ? EMMA KRULL I do n't see that it 's a matter of any interest to the newspapers . p. 22 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Oh , is n't it ! It 's just the sort of thing the yellow New York press would jump at . This young man 's family are well known here , and you are n't without a certain prominence yourself . EMMA KRULL Well , if it makes a good enough story , you certainly ought not to complain , Pop . It may get you back on the front page . MRS . KRULL Are you engaged to him , or are you not ? EMMA KRULL Before I answer  --  just who is it you 're talking about ? MRS . KRULL This young Gresham that everyone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? EMMA KRULL In a way yes . MRS . KRULL I knew it ! SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Yes , and so did someone named Winchell . When did this happen ? EMMA KRULL Last week . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Where ? EMMA KRULL Down in Warrenton . MRS . KRULL When you were visiting with the Frasers ! EMMA KRULL That was the occasion . p. 23 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I suppose you know all about him ? EMMA KRULL I 've been told that his family owns a large part of Manhattan Island , on account of having got here early . And one of his horses won the Grand National last spring . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL And have you also been told that his conduct has been notoriously bad , here and in Europe ? MRS . KRULL Or that he was dismissed from Yale for having entertained a young woman in his dormitory ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We need n't mention that . EMMA KRULL He 's told me all about that case , Mother . He took her in because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . KRULL Very charitable , I 'm sure . But if you imagine that we covet a son-in-law of that particular stamp , you 're very much EMMA KRULL It 's too late , mother . I 've practically promised to give him my heart and hand . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL It 's one promise you can break and , by the Eternal , will break , before this evening is out . MRS . KRULL Is he here , in New York ? EMMA KRULL Oh , yes . He 's here . He ought to be around before very long . p. 24 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You 're planning to go out with him ? EMMA KRULL No , no . I thought we could just sit here and listen to your speech over the radio . MRS . KRULL Why does he want to marry you ? EMMA KRULL That 's something that I 've wondered about . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You might have done well to have wondered about it a little more acutely . You ought to know that you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background and upbringing in the North-West has nothing whatever in common EMMA KRULL I 've lived in the East all the time you 've been Senator  --  and that 's been forever . MRS . KRULL There are some things that environment can never alter . You come of a fine , sturdy , pioneer stock . He comes of an old , decayed , dissipated Well , I wo n't say what I think . EMMA KRULL I swear I do n't know what it is that makes him want to marry me . It must be that he wants my body ! MRS . KRULL Emma ! EMMA KRULL Well , then , mother  --  do n't invite such remarks by asking a lot of impossible questions . Why should n't I marry him ? He 's good-looking , he 's strong , he 's nice and he certainly is able to provide for me. p. 25 MRS . KRULL And he 's capable of making you miserably unhappy  --  of ruining your whole life . EMMA KRULL Yes  --  I suppose that 's true enough . SENATOR HARVEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs into this discussion , Emma . But you may not be aware that there 's an election in South Dakota this fall . EMMA KRULL Oh , come , Pop  --  you 're not worrying about that . You 've never lost an election yet . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I only got through the Republican primaries by the skin of my teeth . You 've got to realize that the situation this year is a precarious one  --  thanks to our estimable friend in the White House . They 're raising all sorts of false issues , business depression , prohibition , internationalism , to cloud the main issue . EMMA KRULL What 's that ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL It 's whether the control of our government is going to be turned over to a pack of gangsters  --  well , you would n't understand . Anyway  --  I 'm in for a hard fight . EMMA KRULL But what has my marriage to Joe Gresham got to do with it ? MRS . KRULL It would have just the same effect on the minds of people out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KRULL I do n't think I see the connection . MRS . KRULL Because you do n't quite know what a force the women 's vote is in South Dakota . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL All the newspapers around here are eager to discredit me . They hate me and fear me , because I 've stood with men like Brookhart against their so-called liberalism . And you can be sure that they 'd lovingly exploit all the unsavory details in young Gresham 's past in an effort to embarrass me . EMMA KRULL What if they do ? What if Joe has got himself mixed up in a few messes ? He was born rich , and it 's taken him a long time to get over it . Everyone around here knows he 's all right  --  and that the girl who marries him wo n't be contaminated . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Perhaps everyone here knows it . But there 's something you 've got to learn , my girl . And that is that New York is not America . MRS . KRULL It 's an element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Conduct that is tolerated and even applauded here is not swallowed quite so easily out where we come from , and if the voters of our State heard that my daughter had involved herself with the very type of rich , licentious club-man that they see in the movies p. 27 EMMA KRULL They 'd say that the Krull family is getting somewhere socially at last . MRS . KRULL You 're very smart , Emma  --  too smart , like most of your generation . But you know nothing about public sentiment in South Dakota . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL The idea of your marrying anyone from New York is bad enough , in view of how our people feel about this place . But this one ! Why , he represents everything that is despicable and contempt EMMA KRULL Excuse me , Pop  --  but I 'm in danger of getting mad and saying things to you and mother that I 'd be awfully sorry for . Ca n't we postpone this discussion ? MRS . KRULL There 's nothing to discuss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And even if they seem ridiculous to you , Emmy , I 'm confident that you want to do what we believe to be right . EMMA KRULL I hope so , Pop . I 'll go and get dressed . ( She goes out , into her bedroom . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( to MRS . KRULL ) You 're too harsh with her . You overdo it . MRS . KRULL If I were her father , I 'd spank her . She has the mind of a child and she needs to be treated just that way . p. 28 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Well , there 's one thing we 've both got to remember in dealing with Emmy . It 's partially our own fault if she 's independent , headstrong MRS . KRULL Our fault ! Have we ever encouraged her to be anything but a dutiful , Christian daughter as she should be ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL No , but we 've neglected her . That 's the bitter penalty we 've had to pay for the distinction we 've gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your D. A. R. , and your W. C. T. U. , and your Federation of Women 's Clubs . Why , the child has never had a real home . She 's grown up here in the East , gone to Eastern schools , been exposed to all the influences that she 'd never have heard of in the normal course of events back home . No wonder she 's collected a lot of false standards . MRS . KRULL Harvey . Do you suppose there has been anything  --  that we ought to know about ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Are you implying that our little girl could have done  --  could have gone to the extent of ? MRS . KRULL It is n't pleasant to harbor such suspicions . But modern youth is beyond all understanding . We never know how far they really go . This young man may have led her on to all sorts of lengths . p. 29 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( agitated ) I admit that the same thought has crossed my mind . MRS . KRULL He 's the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KRULL I 'd like to believe that my daughter is above suspicion . MRS . KRULL You 'd like to believe it . But you know only too well that you ca n't . The clothes she wears , the blasphemous way she talks , the constant cigarettes , and the drinking SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Oh , Lord , do n't parade all the rotten evidence before me . ( He goes to the window and looks at the Chrysler Building . ) It 's New York that 's doing this to our country . New York  --  with its incalculable influence for evil . Poisoning our children with its religion of cynical sophistication . ( He suddenly realizes that he is making a strong speech . ) If I had my way , they would n't be given time to secede . They 'd be kicked out of the Union , and let them tow their island over to Europe , where it belongs . MRS . KRULL Do n't strain your voice . You must n't be hoarse this evening . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her there . If we do n't , there 's no telling what scrapes she 'll get herself into and one taint of scandal on my name would drive every church-going woman in South Dakota into the arms of the Democrats . ( The telephone rings. ) p. 30 MRS . KRULL ( nervously ) There 's the ' phone . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Probably another reporter . You take it . I wo n't see him . MRS . KRULL ( at the telephone ) Hello . Who is it ? ( Startled , she covers the mouthpiece with her hand . ) It 's him ! It 's that Gresham  --  to see Emmy . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL He ca n't see her . MRS . KRULL Hello . I 'm very sorry but SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Wait a minute . If we deny her , it 'll just make her wild and she 's liable to MRS . KRULL ( covering the mouthpiece again ) If you 're ever going to take a firm stand , you 'd better take it now . SENATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll talk to him . MRS . KRULL I 'm not at all sure that that 's the wise thing SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Leave it to me ! MRS . KRULL Hello . You 're to come up . ( She hangs up the receiver . ) There 's no need to tell Emma just yet that he 's here . p. 31 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Now , Edith  --  I have assured you that you can leave this entirely to me . ( The sight of the supper table annoys him . ) I wish they 'd clear this mess out of here . MRS . KRULL I 'll send for the waiter . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL It 's that button marked room service . You push it . MRS . KRULL ( having pushed the button ) He has no right to come here like this ! He 's subjecting us to undesirable publicity . Suppose he had arrived when that reporter was interviewing you . For all we know , that reporter is still outside , watching . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I 'm prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got herself into this , but it 's up to me to get her out . MRS . KRULL You 'll be soft with him , just as you are with Emmy . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I shall talk to him exactly as though he were a delegation of Frenchmen , requesting a cancellation of the war debt ! MRS . KRULL I only hope and pray that she stays in her room until you have disposed of him . ( There is a knock at the door. ) p. 32 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You admit him . ( MRS . KRULL goes to the outer door and opens it . ) MRS . KRULL Come in . ( JOE GRESHAM comes in . He is a personable young man , tall , thin , sunburnt , well dressed and cheerful . He carries his hat in one hand and his stick in the other . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh , good evening , Mrs. Krull . ( He transfers his cane from right hand to left , and shakes hands with her . ) Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd both have gone on to the banquet before I got here . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Good evening . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . It 's a rare treat to see you here in New York , Senator . ( He shakes hands with KRULL . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Happily rare . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Well  --  I do n't blame you . It 's a terrible place . It did n't used to be so bad , but it 's just unbelievable now . Whenever I 'm here , I spend all my time trying to find an excuse to get out . ( He is being very affable  --  making a conscientious effort to divide his remarks evenly between the SENATOR and MRS . KRULL . The latter has sat down on the front edge of the lesser easy chair , and is awaiting developments. ) p. 33 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Will you take a seat ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh  --  thanks . ( He puts his hat and stick down somewhere and sits down . KRULL remains standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that all is not well . ) Are you staying in town long , Mrs. Krull ? MRS . KRULL We 're leaving on the ten o'clock train to-morrow morning . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh , you must n't do that . I 've been hoping to persuade Em to bring you down to the country . It 's much better down there . You do n't get the Chrysler Building in your eye . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We are going home . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . To South Dakota ? MRS . KRULL ( with superb finality ) Yes ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I 'd love to go out there some time . The nearest I 've been to it is Wyoming and I 'll never forget SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( ominously ) Mr. Gresham JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . ( obviously bracing himself ) Yes , sir ? p. 34 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We have been made aware of certain  --  intentions , on your part , toward our daughter . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh ! Em has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rumor which was first brought to our attention through the columns of the press . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I know , Senator . It was that little bounder , Winchell . Honestly , Mrs. Krull , there 's absolutely no way of knowing how he gets hold of these things . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL The source of his information is immaterial . All that concerns us is the unfortunate fact that his information happens to be correct . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . That word " unfortunate " does n't sound very promising . MRS . KRULL Why do you wish to marry our daughter ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Now , Edith ! I do n't think we need to dwell on JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . It 's a perfectly legitimate question , sir . I understand that you want to know all about  --  about everything  --  and I hope there is n't anything that I ca n't tell you . ( He turns to MRS . KRULL . ) I 'm in love with her . That 's really the most important p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Practically three months . I 've been proposing to her steadily since almost the first day . MRS . KRULL And she refused you ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . At least eight hundred times . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL What made her decide to change her mind ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . God only knows . She must have grown sorry for me . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Mr. Gresham . I 'm aware that certain old-fashioned standards of conduct are no longer generally enforced . Young people nowadays do n't consider it necessary to advise their parents of their matrimonial plans until those plans have approached , or even passed , fruition . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I know , Senator . It does look as if we 'd tried to be secretive about it . But the fact is , I have n't been at all sure that  --  that Em was sure she 'd marry me . And I 'm afraid I 'm still a little uncertain about it . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I am in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JR . Has she said definitely that she really means to ? p. 36 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I must inform you that your engagement to Emma is at an end . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . What ? MRS . KRULL We do not wish our daughter to be married to you . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . But , really I do n't see why not ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL It is not necessary or desirable for us to be explicit . We merely state our decision . MRS . KRULL And it is final ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh . You do n't like me . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL It is my duty , in all candor , to say that we do not . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . But you do n't know me . You have n't given me enough of a chance to make myself agreeable , and popular . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You have the misfortune to be conspicuous , in your own set and your own district . MRS . KRULL We 've heard too many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KRULL If your reputation has been unjustly gained , I 'm sure that Mrs. Krull and I will be glad to be advised of the facts . p. 37 JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I do n't even know what my reputation is . MRS . KRULL You were dismissed from Yale University . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh , that . Well , I 'm afraid that was a bit irregular . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL And if I 'm not entirely mistaken , there was an incident in Paris , which necessitated the intervention of our Department of State JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I know . If dear old Mr. Herrick had n't stepped in and squared matters with the gendarmes , I 'd have probably been condemned to Devil 's Island . Em knows all about these things  --  and they do n't seem to worry her . MRS . KRULL Emma 's principles are still underdeveloped . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh , no , they 're not , Mrs. Krull . I really do n't think you know her as well as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impertinence that is perfectly in accord with all that I 've heard of JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I beg your pardon . I meant no impertinence . In fact , I 'm trying my damnedest to be on my very best behavior . I realize that I 've made an ass of myself  --  on numerous occasions  --  but I should think you could trust Em , your own daughter , to change all that . She 's determined to kick all the silly , sub-freshman nonsense out of me  --  and if you really understood her character , you 'd be certain she could do it . Honestly , Mrs. Krull  --  I 'm not so bad at heart . Ask my own mother if I am. p. 38 MRS . KRULL We have not the pleasure of your mother 's acquaintance . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . You should have . You must have . She 's a pretty formidable old party , like your like lots of nice elderly people . She thinks I 'm awful , but not hopeless . ( EMMA comes in . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe ! I 'd have done anything to have spared you from this . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . We 've  --  we 've just been thrashing things out . EMMA KRULL I 'll bet . Is the engagement broken ? MRS . KRULL Yes ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . It is not ! SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We 've outlined our position to your  --  to Mr. Gresham . MRS . KRULL There is nothing more to be said on either side . ( There is a knock on the door . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Who 's that ? ( The WAITER appears . ) WAITER Are you finished with the SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL No , we 're not finished ! Come back later . p. 39 WAITER Yes , sir . ( He places the check on the table and goes out . ) EMMA KRULL Well  --  if it 's all over JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . It is n't all over . We have n't even begun to MRS . KRULL The matter has been settled . EMMA KRULL There 's one favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to say good-by to him , please . I mean  --  it 's perfectly conventional for the lovers to have a good cry together before parting . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . But I have n't the slightest intention of saying good-by . EMMA KRULL Shut up ! Pop  --  will you please lead mother from the room ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Come , honey . We 'll just step into the bedroom and give ' em a couple of minutes to get it over with . MRS . KRULL ( to EMMA ) Very well . But we have no time to spare . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Make it short . ( He holds open the bedroom door as MRS . KRULL goes out . ) EMMA KRULL And , Pop  --  would you mind knocking before you come back ? p. 40 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL All right . ( He goes , closing the door behind him . JOE goes to EMMA , takes her in his arms and kisses her . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I wish I 'd led a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to tell me that you took any of that seriously ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I ought to be hardened to it . Last night I had to go through the same scene with my family . EMMA KRULL Were they furious ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Yes . They too had their attention called to that piece in The Mirror . EMMA KRULL What did they say ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh , you can imagine . EMMA KRULL Poor things . I 've had a mental picture of the expression that would come over your mother 's face when she heard you were engaged to someone named Emma Krull . ( She shudders . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I told them all about your father being the celebrated senator . EMMA KRULL That must have helped ! It was like saying , " the daughter of one of our most distinguished morticians. " p. 41 JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Well  --  there 's nothing they can do about it . EMMA KRULL They can make themselves very unpleasant . JOSEPH GRESHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no news in that . There 's something else , though , and it 's a whole lot worse . EMMA KRULL What is it ? If it 's my family , do n't worry about them . I 'll handle that end of the problem . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . No , it 's something terrible . Em , darling  --  I have n't told you everything about my  --  my entanglements . EMMA KRULL You 've told me enough . Anything more would be pure velvet . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . There is something more , and it 's just simply ghastly . EMMA KRULL A woman ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Yes . She has claims . EMMA KRULL You were engaged to her ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . No  --  but I paid her rent . I 'm still paying it . EMMA KRULL Am I supposed to be pained  --  or horrified  --  or what ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I have n't had anything to do with her since . But she 'd always been decent with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept on sending her checks , and best wishes . Oh  --  I 've been the damnedest kind of damned fool ! p. 42 EMMA KRULL You do n't need to be so upset , Joe . But there 's one thing I would appreciate , very much . I wish you 'd get rid of her now . I hope you do n't think I 'm being narrow-minded about it . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . That 's just the trouble . I ca n't get rid of her ! EMMA KRULL What  --  is she in love with you ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . No ! Anything but that . EMMA KRULL Then pay her off . You can do that , ca n't you ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I could if she 'd be half way decent about it . But she wo n't . She 's a tough baby . She wants one hundred thousand dollars . She says it must be paid , all of it , at once , or she 'll have the whole story smeared over the tabloids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I ca n't raise that much , unless I go to father about it . There are some things he 'd have to sign . EMMA KRULL I can imagine there might be a few complications . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Of course he 's willing to do a lot to keep me out of a breach-of-promise suit  --  ordinarily . But not this time . The way he took on last night , he would n't lift a finger to make it all right for me to marry you . I 've got to pay her myself . p. 43 EMMA KRULL Ca n't you beat her down a little ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . No  --  she 's sized up the situation beautifully . She knows all about my family and yours , too , and she 's figured just how anxious we all are to avoid any suggestion of scandal . EMMA KRULL How did she find out ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . She read that damned announcement in Winchell 's column . EMMA KRULL We have him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRESHAM , JR . If it were n't for the fact that your father 's a U. S. senator , I 'd tell her to go ahead and sue , and I know she 'd be glad to compromise . ( There is a knock at the door . EMMA goes to the door and opens it a little way . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( from the bedroom ) It 's time for us to go . EMMA KRULL Not yet , Pop . Those things always begin late . ( She closes the door . ) Have you talked to her about it ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Have I ! I was there all afternoon , arguing and threatening . EMMA KRULL And she held out for a hundred thousand ? p. 44 JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . She did . EMMA KRULL Who is this wonder woman ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . You may have heard of her . Her name is Phyllis Adrian . EMMA KRULL Phyllis Adrian . Oh , if I only had a name like that ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story in the Cosmopolitan . EMMA KRULL Is she somebody on the stage ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . She works in the chorus , off and on . She 's one of those impressive ones that walk down the staircase with nothing on but diamonds . EMMA KRULL Where do you  --  maintain her ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . In an apartment on Central Park West . EMMA KRULL What 's she like ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Well  --  she 's sort of Oh , I do n't know . What difference does it make ? EMMA KRULL Never mind , Joe . Do n't try to describe her . I 'm sure she 's desperately attractive . You would n't have taken up with her if she were n't . You see  --  that 's just conceit that makes me say that . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . She is attractive  --  and I always thought she was a good sport . p. 45 EMMA KRULL By that I take it you mean a good loser . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I 'm in wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind that would n't hesitate to get me in worse . She 'll lie through her teeth about my heartless desertion  --  and everybody will believe every word of it . I 'm in a terrible fix  --  and the fact that it 's all my own fault does n't make it any easier . If I ca n't raise that money  --  and I ca n't ( There is another peremptory knock from the bedroom . ) EMMA KRULL ( at the door ) Ca n't you be patient , Pop ? MRS . KRULL We have to leave this minute . EMMA KRULL All right  --  we 're almost through . ( She shuts the door . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Em . Would you be willing to go some place , and marry me , and take the consequences ? EMMA KRULL No , Joe  --  I could n't quite do that . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Why not ? Lots of people have gone through messes like this and come out alive , and even happy . EMMA KRULL No , Joe  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that I have n't time to explain . It 's the quality of public sentiment in the State of South Dakota . Sometimes I think that the best thing that could happen to me , and to the United States , would be to have Pop beaten for re-election . But it would just kill him , and mother , too . She 's the one who lines up the women 's vote for him , and if he lost p. 46 JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . All right . I 'll get her to shut up if it costs me everything I have in the EMMA KRULL Go around there now , Joe , and see her . Plead with her . Throw yourself on her mercy . Humble yourself before her . Show her my picture JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . She 's seen your picture in Town and Country . That 's one of the reasons for the high price . ( There is a knock on the door , and MRS . KRULL comes in , followed presently by the SENATOR . ) MRS . KRULL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you 'd better hurry . I 'll be up when you get back . MRS . KRULL ( to JOE ) I hardly think it advisable for you to remain in this room . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . It 's perfectly all right , Mrs. Krull . It 's a sitting room . The house detectives do n't object if it 's a suite . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( who has been getting his black felt hat ) Young man  --  I am not in the least interested in the moral code prevalent among house detectives . I must ask you to leave , before we do . p. 47 EMMA KRULL You 'd better go quietly , Joe . MRS . KRULL And not return during our absence . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . If you wish me not to , Mrs. Krull , of course I wo n't . But poor Em ca n't stay here all alone all evening . EMMA KRULL Never mind me , Joe . You have other duties . I 'll curl up with a book until the broadcast starts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good-by , Mrs. Krull . ( MRS . KRULL nods and moves her lips . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I 'll say one thing , Gresham . I like the manly way you 've taken this . ( He extends his hand . ) Good-by . ( They shake hands . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Thank you , Senator . I was very anxious to make a good impression . ( He starts out . ) EMMA KRULL Keep on being manly , Joe . You may accomplish something . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Yes  --  I may . ( He is not happy as he goes out . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Emmy  --  I want you to know that we feel badly about this . Your mother and I have just been regretting the fact that , in a measure , we have n't been entirely fair with you . We realize that we 've never given you the kind of solid home that a girl of your age needs . p. 48 EMMA KRULL That 's all right , Pop . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to start ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Just a minute , honey . There 's one thing you have n't told us , Em . Do you love this young man ? EMMA KRULL Well  --  I suppose please , Pop  --  that 's a pretty embarrassing question . MRS . KRULL It seems to me , Emma , that you 're not entirely sure of your own mind . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Your mother is right . Now , after we 've finished with this Boston trip , we 'll go on out to Sioux Falls and settle down among our own people and think things over for a few months , eh ? EMMA KRULL Until after election day . MRS . KRULL Come on . EMMA KRULL Good-by , Pop . I hope the speech goes over big . ( She kisses him . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You 're not so bad as you like to think you are , eh , Em ? EMMA KRULL Probably not . MRS .

Hello , Mr. Hauser ? This is Senator Krull 's daughter . You know , the one you helped with the soup . Yes . I 'm sorry to bother you , but there 's something I 've got to find out . Can you be trusted ? Are you sure of that ? Good ! Have you ever heard of a lady named Phyllis Adrian ? She 's a chorus girl  --  one of the impressive ones .

( He goes out , left. ) @x The scene is the living room of PHYLLIS ADRIAN 'S apartment on the nineteenth floor of a building on Central Park West . It is very new and , of course , self-consciously modern in its decoration . Everything in it  --  the furniture , lamps , bric -- brac  --  would seem to have been delivered , in one load , from the Au Quatrime department at Wanamaker 's . It is a corner apartment , facing southeast , and arranged so that there is a large bay window , in the upstage left angle of the scene , which looks out across the park toward the Plaza . At the right , upstage , is a door leading into the dining room . Downstage , right , is a door opening onto the hall , which leads to the main entrance and also to the kitchen . At the left is a door leading to the bedroom . At the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the centre is a couch , and behind it a refectory table . Another small table at the left bears the one-piece telephone . There are various ornamental chairs about , and art work on the walls to match . There is a tall mirror on the wall at the left . LUCILLE , the colored servant , is sitting on the couch , reading The Daily Mirror . She is neat and respectable-looking , and wears pince-nez eye-glasses . The radio is going ; it is some pianist , rendering " By the Waters of the Minnetonka . " The door at the left is open . The time is somewhat later in the same evening as Act I. PHYLLIS ADRIAN 'S voice is heard from the left . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Hey , Lucille . p. 52 LUCILLE Yes , Miss Phil . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Have n't we had about enough of that ? LUCILLE Yes , Miss Phil .

LUCILLE ( placidly ) No , Miss Phil . ( PHYLLIS comes in from the bedroom . She is slim , graceful , studiously poised and only partially dressed .

That was n't the word she used when she told me about it . LUCILLE I s'pose not . Well  --  she 'll know better next time . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Fasten this , will you .

HARRY GLASSMAN I lost a boat off Montauk this morning . Six thousand cases . I guess the Coast Guard is cock-eyed drunk to-night . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dramatic section . ) That Theatre Guild show got wonderful notices . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Did you go to the opening ? HARRY GLASSMAN I did . And it was a honey . If they do n't do any better pretty soon I 'm going to cancel my subscription . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I read what that Atkinson said about it in The Times . HARRY GLASSMAN Did he like the show ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN I could n't make out . How 's Clarisse ? HARRY GLASSMAN Clarisse is in bad shape . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that . Hey ! Look out for that pin ! LUCILLE Now you ai n't hurt yet , Miss Phil . PHYLLIS ADRIAN What seems to be the chief trouble with her ? HARRY GLASSMAN She 's been hitting it again . p. 55 PHYLLIS ADRIAN No !

But can I tell her that ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN You ought to be thankful to have somebody as crazy about you as that . HARRY GLASSMAN I sometimes wish to God she 'd get sick of me . PHYLLIS ADRIAN No , you do n't . You 'll always be a sap about her . Well  --  it just goes to show that even a gorilla has human weaknesses . ( She goes back into her room .

I wish my kid would grow up to be like him  --  well educated , and snappy . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Your kid ? HARRY GLASSMAN You did n't know I had one , did you ? Well  --  I have . He lives out on the Coast , with his mother . He plays polo , too . He 's going to enter the University of Southern California next fall . I wanted him to come East and go to Harvard or Yale , or one of those high-class schools . But I guess my ex-wife wanted to keep him as far as possible away from me . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Do you blame her ? HARRY GLASSMAN No  --  I do n't . She 's even changed her name  --  to Glaezer  --  so when the news breaks that I 've been bumped off , the boy wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PHYLLIS appears in the doorway again . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Nobody 's going to bump you off , Harry . p. 57 HARRY GLASSMAN No ? They got Rothstein , did n't they ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Well  --  if they do get you , I hope it 'll be your own friends that do it , and not the law . ( She goes back into the bedroom . ) HARRY GLASSMAN Say  --  the law is the best pal I 've got . Did you call up that smart lawyer I told you about ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN No . HARRY GLASSMAN You better do it . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I 'm not splitting with lawyers  --  not yet . HARRY GLASSMAN Well  --  you 'll be a sucker to try to swing a thing like this by yourself . You 're liable to overplay your hand . If you take my advice , you 'll turn it over to Nick Pinanski now , and do everything he tells you . He 's settled plenty of cases exactly like this before . Why , the muggs shiver at the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and close . JOE comes in . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh  --  hello , Harry . HARRY GLASSMAN Why , hello , Joe ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Where 's Phil ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Hello , sweets . I 'll be right out . ( JOE has wandered over to the left , glanced into the bedroom , and then turned away . He is obviously distracted. ) p. 58 HARRY GLASSMAN ( very genial ) Well  --  what do you think of Federal Power today ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I have n't seen a paper . What did it do ? HARRY GLASSMAN A new low ! ( He laughs . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Were you on it ? HARRY GLASSMAN I certainly was . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Too bad . HARRY GLASSMAN Well  --  I took the loss and pulled out . By the way , Joe  --  I want to offer my congratulations . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . What for ? HARRY GLASSMAN I 've heard some pretty marvellous news about you . They tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh  --  yes . HARRY GLASSMAN I do n't happen to know the young lady in question , but I 've seen her pictures plenty of times in the papers , and she looks good . I mean , I certainly congratulate you . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Thanks very much . HARRY GLASSMAN It 's a great little state , matrimony . I have n't been there in years , but I can tell you it 's a lot better than it 's made out to be . There are plenty of things that 's worse . ( He accompanies this sage observation with a glance upward . PHYLLIS comes in , fully dressed. ) p. 59 PHYLLIS ADRIAN Well , sweets  --  it 's a surprise seeing you here . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Yes  --  it is . HARRY GLASSMAN I suppose you want me to bow out at this point . PHYLLIS ADRIAN No , Harry . You stick around . HARRY GLASSMAN I tell you what . Why do n't the two of you come on upstairs to my place . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can PHYLLIS ADRIAN Yes . I know what you want . You want to have us as escort when you face Clarisse . HARRY GLASSMAN You 're a fine neighbor ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . If you do n't mind , Harry  --  I have n't got much time , and there 's something I 've got to talk to Phil about . So , if you do n't mind . HARRY GLASSMAN Not at all , Joe . Far be it from me to be the third party . PHYLLIS ADRIAN ( to JOE ) Is it so personal as all that ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Yes . HARRY GLASSMAN ( at the door ) But will you please come up soon ? p. 60 PHYLLIS ADRIAN Sure . HARRY GLASSMAN ' By , Joe . ( He goes out . ) ( JOE has sat down on the couch . PHYLLIS stands behind him and strokes his hair . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Well  --  what 's on the little mind now ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Cut it out . ( He brushes her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . You know damned well what 's on my mind . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Yes  --  and I 've told you just how to get it off , have n't I , sweets ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . And do n't call me sweets ! I never did like that word . Now , it 's just simply nauseating . PHYLLIS ADRIAN You 've got to forgive me , Joe , if I ca n't help being a little sentimental . You see , it is n't so easy for me to realize that all our happy times are over . I 've been thinking about them those rides we used to take down to Long Beach on hot nights , and all those cozy little suppers at Reuben 's and  --  and , well , I 'm afraid I cried a little . ( JOE gives her a look , but makes no comment on that statement. ) p. 61 JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I came here to tell you that there 's absolutely nothing doing on that deal of yours . PHYLLIS ADRIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a hundred thousand dollars . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I 've heard different . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . You 've heard wrong . PHYLLIS ADRIAN What 's become of all that dough ? Has the Chase National Bank failed ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . You could n't begin to understand all the difficulties there are . Have you ever met my father ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN No , I have n't . But any time you want to bring him up , I 'll be only too pleased to . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh , for God 's sake , Phil . Have n't you got a spark of common kindness in that ice-box of a heart of yours ? You ought to realize that I 'll give you just as much as I possibly can . PHYLLIS ADRIAN If I only had myself to think of , it would be different . We 'd part with a handshake and not another word . But there are others . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Yes  --  I know . There 's your old mother , and your thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already staked the whole outfit to at least six operations apiece , and I do n't know how many trips to California . What 's the matter with them now ? p. 62 PHYLLIS ADRIAN The doctors say they have to be moved to the south of France . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . All of them ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN All except little Fred  --  and if he does n't get into the Alps at once , it may be too late . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Now listen , Phil . Suppose I tell you on my word of honor that I 'll raise every last cent I can  --  every last cent . It might be as much as forty or fifty thousand . Whatever it is , I swear it 's all yours . PHYLLIS ADRIAN You 're very white , Joe . I 've known that all along . You 're as white a man as God ever created , and I only wish there were a few more like you . But there are n't , Joe . There are n't enough decent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I 'm holding out for one hundred grand . ( JOE goes to the window and contemplates the electric signs on 59th Street . ) What are you looking at , Joe ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . At the General Motors sign . " The Most Significant Chevrolet in Chevrolet History . " As if anybody cared ! ( This seems to inspire him to an outburst of courageous vehemence . He turns on her . ) All right , hold out for your hundred thousand . Hold out forever , and see what it gets you . Not a damned nickel out of me  --  and a lot of lawyers ' fees out of your own fat bank account . Because you know you have n't got any case if it ever comes to court . p. 63 PHYLLIS ADRIAN I do n't need a case . All I need is a good lawyer  --  and I 'm going to get one . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Who ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN You 'll find out . If you want to be a little soldier about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose this South Dakota dbutante you 're so JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . You do n't know what you 're talking about . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I do n't , eh ! I guess that ham senator from the West will stand by you when your name is being dragged through the dirt . I guess your own father will stand by you . Yes ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . What kind of story are you going to cook up ? I suppose it 'll be that I promised you marriage , and then stole your poor little virtue . PHYLLIS ADRIAN It 'd be pretty hard to prove that you did n't . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Impossible  --  but I hope you wo n't stop at anything as obvious and simple as that . You know , to get any attention in this town nowadays you 've got to make me out some kind of a fiend . You ought to be able to do that , with your nasty mind . PHYLLIS ADRIAN You think I 'm pretty cruel , do n't you ? p. 64 JOSEPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADRIAN Well , you are n't far wrong . I 'll be honest with you , Joe  --  and tell you that I would n't even treat a dog the way I 'm going to treat you . And do you want to know why ? It 's because I 've never yet seen a dog that had any money . And I 'm not falling for that hard-times gag , either . One hundred thousand dollars is a drop in the bucket with you , and you know it , and so do I. And if I do n't get it before Wednesday noon , my affairs go into the hands of Mr. Nicholas Pinanski , of Callahan , Pinanski &amp; Hughes . ( JOE regards her with loathing for a while , then turns and strides to the door . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Good-by , you bitch ! ( He goes out . PHYLLIS follows him to the hall entrance . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Good night , sweets . ( The slam of the front door is heard . After a moment , PHYLLIS calls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Miss Phil . " ) What was the station where they were going to broadcast that speech ? ( LUCILLE has come in . She goes to consult The Mirror . ) LUCILLE It was JZ , I think . ( While LUCILLE is searching the radio column , PHYLLIS goes to the radio , at the right . ) Yes  --  WJZ , " Banquet of Society of Sons of the Northwest , Hotel Astor , 9 P.M. " ( PHYLLIS has been tuning in on WJZ , passing one or two stations on the way . The resonant voice of KRULL booms forth from the loud speaker . It is much too loud at first , but is softened by PHYLLIS 'S manipulation of the volume control. ) p. 65 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL For a hundred and fifty-four years , since the first , faint rays of golden light heralded the dawn of liberty , Europe has looked upon these United States with frank and confident scorn . Among the sovereign nations of the Old World , our country has been regarded as a red-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's him . LUCILLE It certainly is . I heard him lots of times on the radio when he was talkin ' against Al Smith . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL But now  --  to-day ! What now is the attitude of the Old World toward us of the New ? It is one , my friends , of cringing , obsequious respect . ( Applause . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN How would you like to have that for a father-in-law ? ( The door-bell rings . LUCILLE goes to answer it . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Within the past decade , this former step-child among nations has achieved recognition  --  universal recognition !  --  as the Big Brother of all humanity ! ( Prolonged applause and cheers . ) LUCILLE It 's a lady that wants to see you . p. 66 PHYLLIS ADRIAN Who ? LUCILLE She do n't say who she is . ( EMMA comes in . ) EMMA KRULL I 'm terribly sorry to have to crash in like this . PHYLLIS ADRIAN What do you want ? EMMA KRULL Are you Miss Adrian ? PHYLLIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The applause has died down , and KRULL 'S voice is again heard . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We find ourselves on top of the world ! ( Startled , EMMA has wheeled around and seen the radio . ) EMMA KRULL It 's Pop ! PHYLLIS ADRIAN What ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL But , my friends , the position of leadership is not always an enviable one . ( PHYLLIS shuts off the radio . ) EMMA KRULL I beg your pardon . That voice made me jump . It 's my father . PHYLLIS ADRIAN ( peering at EMMA ) Well , well ! Of all people ! How do you do , Miss Krull ? p. 67 EMMA KRULL How do you do , Miss Adrian ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN He sent you here , did n't he ? EMMA KRULL Who ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Joe  --  the big coward . EMMA KRULL He does n't know I 'm here . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Oh , no . He just went down in the elevator this minute , and you were waiting for him outside in the taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For God 's sake you go up and try to reason with her . " EMMA KRULL I was waiting outside , but he did n't know it . I was across the street , on one of those park benches , watching for him to come out . And when he did , and I saw him drive away , I came in . PHYLLIS ADRIAN All right . We 'll let it go at that . Sit down , Miss Krull . EMMA KRULL Thanks . ( She sits . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Will you have a drink ? EMMA KRULL I 'd love to . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Lucille ! ( LUCILLE 'S voice replies . Presently she appears . ) What would you like ? We have Scotch , rye , champagne , liqueurs , beers . p. 68 EMMA KRULL I 'm very fond of champagne . PHYLLIS ADRIAN We have tastes in common . Champagne , Lucille . LUCILLE Yes , Miss Phil . ( She goes to get it . PHYLLIS sits down . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN So Joe told you the bad news about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me everything  --  I hope . PHYLLIS ADRIAN He was even thoughtful enough to give you my address . EMMA KRULL Oh , no . I found that out through a friend of mine who works on a newspaper . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Well  --  that 's possible . EMMA KRULL It was n't very polite of me to come up without any warning  --  but  --  I was afraid that if I did call you beforehand you would n't let me in . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I do n't know how I could have stopped you . After all , it 's Joe who pays the rent here , and I guess you have as much right to use it as I have . EMMA KRULL ( looking around ) It 's quite an attractive place . PHYLLIS ADRIAN It 's novel . p. 69 EMMA KRULL Did you do it yourself ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN No . It was an interior decorator , Sheila Lavery . EMMA KRULL Oh , yes . PHYLLIS ADRIAN She 's queer , but she 's clever . Joe got her up here one day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later it was all set for me to move in . EMMA KRULL You must have been thrilled . PHYLLIS ADRIAN What ? EMMA KRULL I mean  --  it must have been just like a bride , coming in to her new home . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Well  --  I did n't think of that at the time . EMMA KRULL How many rooms have you ? I hope you do n't mind me being so inquisitive  --  but  --  you can imagine that I 'd be interested . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I do n't mind at all . In there 's the dining room , and beyond it , the kitchen . And on this side 's the bedroom . ( Indicating the left . ) EMMA KRULL ( looking toward the bedroom ) I see . Just one bedroom ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Just one . p. 70 EMMA KRULL You must be very comfortable . PHYLLIS ADRIAN That 's my ambition . ( LUCILLE comes in with a tray , on which are an open bottle of champagne and two glasses . She hands the drinks to PHYLLIS and EMMA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've always wanted to live somewhere where there 's champagne always on ice . PHYLLIS ADRIAN You 'll get your wish . Joe 's very lavish  --  in some ways . EMMA KRULL Well , thanks very much . ( She takes a good gulp of the champagne . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Do n't mention it . ( She takes a more discreet sip . ) Does your father know where you are ? EMMA KRULL Oh , no . I 've got to get back to the hotel before he does . I 'll go now if I 'm interfering with your plans at all . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I 'm in no hurry . You can take all the time you want getting around to the main subject . EMMA KRULL What main subject ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Money . EMMA KRULL Oh ! You still think that Joe sent me here to  --  to reason with you ? p. 71 PHYLLIS ADRIAN I 'm making no accusations . I 'm just waiting for you to begin . EMMA KRULL I do n't even want to mention that subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Well  --  you ought n't to worry about a little matter of a hundred grand out of Joe 's roll . He 'll have plenty left . EMMA KRULL Of course he will . More than I 'll ever need . This is marvellous champagne . PHYLLIS ADRIAN It ought to be . It comes from headquarters . I 've got a neighbor upstairs who 's one of the biggest shots in the business . ( She is pouring some more champagne . ) EMMA KRULL You mean a boot-legger ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Oh , no . He 's the one the boot-leggers get it from . EMMA KRULL I 'd love to meet him . PHYLLIS ADRIAN That could be arranged . EMMA KRULL I envy you , Miss Adrian . Knowing everybody , going everywhere . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Now , you need n't be formal . Everybody calls me Phil . EMMA KRULL Thanks . There 's really no reason why we should n't get to be friends . We 're just two girls , in practically the same boat . p. 72 PHYLLIS ADRIAN The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But  --  I 'm a stranger on board . You see , Phil  --  I come from the Great North-west  --  the wheat country . Out there , when a young man kisses a young girl for the first time , that 's the same as PHYLLIS ADRIAN I know . EMMA KRULL My parents never told me about the facts of life , and you ca n't blame them for neglect . In South Dakota , there are n't any facts worth repeating . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Well , my dear , you 've come to the right place to get an education . In this town , you learn fast . EMMA KRULL That 's what I want to do . I want to be just like you , and live in a place like this , on the nineteenth floor , with a view of Central Park , and a big boot-legger for a neighbor . PHYLLIS ADRIAN When you get married to Joe , you wo n't live in this neighborhood . You 'll be on the other side East . ( With a gesture eastward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN It used to be , but it 's changing . The Christian colony over there is getting smaller and smaller . p. 73 EMMA KRULL Joe and I will have to come over here often to see you . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Oh , I 'm planning to move to Park Avenue myself , if all goes well . EMMA KRULL Let 's hope it will . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Let 's be pretty damned sure of it . ( She refills the glasses . ) Joe certainly thinks he 's wild about you . EMMA KRULL Do you think he is ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN I know it . I can tell it by the way he acts . EMMA KRULL How does he act ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN He takes things so seriously . He 's moody . And that is n't like him . He 's usually one of those what-of-it boys . But I 'd like to give you one piece of advice , Emma . EMMA KRULL I 'm crazy to hear it . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Do n't let yourself fall in love with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EMMA KRULL Would it have been so awful if you had ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN It would have been ruinous . If I 'd got myself in love with him , do you think I 'd have been able to stand up to him the way I 'm doing now , and make him pay me off before he marries you ? p. 74 EMMA KRULL You 'd have just as much of a right to get what you deserve . PHYLLIS ADRIAN More of a right . But I 'd be sentimental about it . I 'd say , " Go ahead , Joe  --  have your happiness  --  marry the girl you love  --  and do n't think any more about me . " And then the minute he went out the door , I 'd jump out the window  --  another broken doll . Have some more champagne . EMMA KRULL Thanks . PHYLLIS ADRIAN You may find yourself in the same position one of these days . Not that I want to seem pessimistic , but EMMA KRULL Oh , I know what men are . PHYLLIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KRULL I do n't , by experience . But anyone who has ever read a book is bound to have a few suspicions on the subject . PHYLLIS ADRIAN When he does cool off , he 'll come around and ask you to be a good sport about it . EMMA KRULL Naturally . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Do n't let him get away with it . You 've got to hold out for your accident insurance , like I 've done . But you 'll never be able to do it if you 've made the mistake of falling for him . ( The door-bell rings. ) p. 75 EMMA KRULL Who 's that ? It is n't Joe , is it ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Oh , no . He has a key . Who is it , Lucille ? ( JEAN 'S strident voice is heard as the front door opens . ) JEAN DORAN Hello , Lucille . Are we welcome ? ( JEAN comes in . She is very girlish , but not very young ; her hair is too red . She is followed by BABE SAVITO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADRIAN Hello , Jean . Hello , Babe . JEAN DORAN Hello , darling . BABE SAVITO Hello , Phil . JEAN DORAN We 've been up at Harry 's , and , my dear , words ca n't express it . PHYLLIS ADRIAN This is a friend of mine . ( Indicating EMMA . ) Miss  --  Miss Jessup . ( EMMA darts a glance of gratitude at PHYLLIS for this display of discretion . ) Miss Doran . JEAN DORAN How do you do , Miss Jessup ? So glad to know you . PHYLLIS ADRIAN And Mr. Babe Savito , champion of the world . I can never remember what weight . p. 76 BABE SAVITO All weights ! JEAN DORAN Well , my dear , the party upstairs is sim ply beyond words . Everybody 's leaving . You ca n't conceive of the way Clarisse is behaving . She 's got herself so full of cocaine she 's pos itively disgusting . BABE SAVITO If I was Harry , believe me I 'd take a sock at that dame . JEAN DORAN It 's the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a drink ? JEAN DORAN ( looking at the tray ) What is this , champagne ? No  --  I 've been sticking to rye . PHYLLIS ADRIAN There 's some in the dining room . Lucille ! ( The door-bell rings . ) JEAN DORAN Never mind . We 'll get it for ourselves , wo n't we , Babe darling ? BABE SAVITO Sure . ( JEAN goes into the dining room , chattering gaily , followed by BABE . ) EMMA KRULL Who are they ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN She 's some kind of fancy buyer  --  with Macy 's , I think . Spends half her time in Paris . And Babe Savito  --  I guess you 've heard of him . p. 77 EMMA KRULL They seem awfully nice . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Well , they 're not . They 're a couple of punks . Oh , hello , Judge . ( JUDGE GOHAGAN comes in  --  a suave , sleek , hard-boiled , Tammany good fellow ; he is in the prime of life , and enjoying it . With him is MILT FLIESLER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior decorator . SHEILA is very smartly dressed , her skin is chalk white , her lips gaudy red , and she has an ominous expression . ) JUDGE GOHAGAN Hello , sweetheart . We got thrown out , upstairs . ( He kisses PHYLLIS . ) SHEILA LAVERY ( in a bored baritone ) Hello , Phil . JUDGE GOHAGAN ( eyeing EMMA ) And who 's this little ornament ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN This is I 'm terribly sorry , but I 've forgotten your name . EMMA KRULL I think it was Jessup . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Oh , of course ! Miss Jessup  --  Judge Gohagan , Miss Sheila Lavery and  --  who 's that ? Oh  --  hello , Milt . ( There are general greetings and bowings , not joined in by SHEILA. ) p. 78 SHEILA LAVERY Where 's Jean ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Gone into the dining room , to get some rye . SHEILA LAVERY With that greasy prize-fighter ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Yes . ( SHEILA strides into the dining room . ) JUDGE GOHAGAN Can you beat it ? She 's burning ! MILT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending his butler down with all the supper because he ca n't use it . JUDGE GOHAGAN He 's turning the whole party over to you , including the bad will . ( To EMMA . ) Have I met you before , blondie ? ( He is making a pass . ) EMMA KRULL No  --  I do n't think so . ( She tries not to shrink . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN She 's just in from the Northwest . She do n't know anybody here . JUDGE GOHAGAN Well  --  we got to do something about that , eh , baby ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Why do n't you go on in with the others and have a drink , or something . ( LUCILLE comes in. ) p. 79 MILT FLIESLER I 'd be glad to . ( He goes into the dining room . ) LUCILLE Mr. Glassman 's butler and the maid and the chef has come down with a lot a sandwiches and salad and things like that . Do you want ' em put in the dining room ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Yes . JUDGE GOHAGAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing and then the other , I 'm hungry . LUCILLE ( wearily ) All right . ( She goes out . There is plenty of talk heard from the dining room . ) JUDGE GOHAGAN Say  --  there 's some battle royal going on upstairs . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Hopped up again , is she ? JUDGE GOHAGAN To the eye-lashes . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Poor kid . I suppose I 'd better go up and see if there 's anything I can do . JUDGE GOHAGAN I would n't . You 're liable to get hurt . She 's tearing hair , throwing things , smashing up expensive early American antiques . It 's going to cost Harry a lot of dough . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Is he with her ? p. 80 JUDGE GOHAGAN Yeh  --  and he 's taking it on the chin , believe me ! I 've been telling him for a long time he ought to get rid of that snow-bird . I mean to say , a man like Harry Glassman ought n't to have to put up with that stuff . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  what do you say we go eat ? You come along with me , cuteness , and we 'll split a lettuce and tomato on rye . ( He has put his arm around EMMA and is leading her to the dining room . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Hey ! You go ahead , Judge . We 'll follow . JUDGE GOHAGAN Something private ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Yes ! JUDGE GOHAGAN ( knowingly ) I get you . But do n't forget , baby  --  when you come into the bar , just ask for the judge . ( He goes to the dining-room door , from which issue raucous sounds of strife . ) What 's this , what 's this ? More fighting . Now , please , ladies . ( He has gone out . PHYLLIS goes after him and closes the door . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Look here , girlie . I think you 'd better be going on home . p. 81 EMMA KRULL Am I in the way ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN It is n't that , but I do n't like the looks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad as long as there 's a judge present . PHYLLIS ADRIAN The judge is n't on legal duty to-night . He 's on the make  --  and I do n't think your father would want you to learn too much all at once . EMMA KRULL You need n't be nervous about me , Phil . This is just the kind of party I love ! Wait a minute . ( She goes to the radio and turns it on . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL had it not been for the policy of weak-kneed vacillation in the White House , this nation would have marched on to EMMA KRULL ( switching it off ) It 's all right . Pop 's still talking . I do n't have to go yet . ( GLASSMAN has come in . ) HARRY GLASSMAN The front door was wide open , so I just walked in . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Oh , that 's all right . Leave it wide open so that everybody can come in . ( He has slumped down on the couch . ) By the looks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been put up in Joe Leblang's. p. 82 HARRY GLASSMAN I 'm sorry , Phil . But there was just no use . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Never mind . How 's Clarisse now ? HARRY GLASSMAN She 's quieter . PHYLLIS ADRIAN That 's good . Oh ! Excuse me  --  I want you to meet my friend , Miss Jessup . This is Mr. Harry Glassman , one of our most outstanding racketeers . HARRY GLASSMAN ( without looking up ) Glad to meet you . Where 's the rest of the gang ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN They 're in there , some of them . The others must have gone home . Would it do any good if I went upstairs and talked to Clarisse ? HARRY GLASSMAN You can if you want to . But you might just get her started again . You have n't got such a thing as any bromo seltzer , have you ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Certainly . There 's some in the bathroom . HARRY GLASSMAN ( standing up ) I need it . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Take a couple of heaping teaspoonfuls . HARRY GLASSMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , Phil : I 've stood it just as long as I can stand anything . p. 83 PHYLLIS ADRIAN I know that , Harry . Now go on and HARRY GLASSMAN If I thought it was my own fault that she 's got herself into this state , why , I swear to God I 'd go through with it and I 've put her through two cures already and she 's come out of them worse than before . One of these days she 's going to get a hold of a gun and kill me . I 've got to send her away . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Is she going to like that ? HARRY GLASSMAN No  --  she is n't . But it 's got to be done . There 's a place out in Indiana  --  everybody says it 's fine , and healthy . They know how to take care of  --  of people that get like that . Maybe she 'll be absolutely O. K. in a couple of months . Oh , jeez , Phil  --  I know everybody 's going to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Never mind , Harry . You 'll only make your headache worse . Go and take that bromo seltzer . And lie down for a while , if you want to . HARRY GLASSMAN All right . ( He goes out at the left . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN There , Emma  --  get a load of that little lesson . There 's a fine demonstration of what love is. p. 84 EMMA KRULL Is that love ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Yes . That 's love . That poor little floosie upstairs  --  the one they call Clarisse  --  she 's just absolutely nuts about him . She eats and drinks and breathes Harry Glassman . Can you believe it ? EMMA KRULL He must have treated her terribly . PHYLLIS ADRIAN He has not . He 's been wonderful to her . He picked her up when she was a bum cooch dancer , and he 's given her everything . But just because his business takes him out of the city a lot well , you can see what 's happened . She 's taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's away . EMMA KRULL How long have they been married ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN They never bothered to get married . But they 've been living together for seven years . Seven years ! That 's a long time in New York . EMMA KRULL And is he going to leave her now ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN I guess so . He 'll take care of her all right . He can afford it . But what good will that do her , when she ca n't have him ? EMMA KRULL Is it anything like that with you and Joe ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN No  --  nothing at all . But I 'm going to make it sound like that by the time it comes out in the papers . p. 85 EMMA KRULL It 'll be a sensational story , wo n't it ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN It 'll be a beaut . But do you or do n't you admit that he 's got it coming to him ? ( EMMA has glanced at her watch . ) EMMA KRULL Look here , Phil . I have n't much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the main subject now . Do you mind ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Certainly not ! EMMA KRULL ( advancing ) I 'm glad to have had a chance to know you , Phil . It strengthens my faith in Joe 's taste . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Go on , dear . I know what 's coming . EMMA KRULL You 're honest . You 're not at all like what I expected . And I want to be the same with you . I 'm going to marry Joe  --  and all the scandals you can cut loose wo n't stop me . PHYLLIS ADRIAN You mean you 'd stick to him even if I made him the gag of the town ? EMMA KRULL That 's what I mean . You 're wasting your time threatening him . The only one you can really hurt is my father  --  and  --  and certainly you have n't got anything to gain from that . You do n't care who wins the next election in South Dakota . Now , listen , Phil , you 've got brains  --  and what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get what you can , and do n't think I begrudge it to you ; but I do n't want to see you come out of this with nothing but the knowledge that you 've injured a kind man who does n't ask for anything in this world but to belong to the U. S. Senate . So I advise you to be smart and settle with Joe for whatever he can raise  --  because that 's all you can possibly get . ( PHYLLIS regards EMMA with unconcealed admiration. ) p. 86 PHYLLIS ADRIAN You 're a funny kid , Emma . I wonder how Joe ever happened to pick you out . ( The JUDGE comes in bearing a huge platter full of sandwiches . ) JUDGE GOHAGAN Say ! Ai n't you kids ever going to eat ? ( As he leans over to hand them the platter , he says , in a low tone . ) Confidentially , we got a new uproar on our hand . ( JEAN and SHEILA come in , carrying highball glasses . ) SHEILA LAVERY I 'll slap his filthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please try to believe me when I BABE SAVITO ( coming in ) Well  --  if there 's going to be any socking going on around here JUDGE GOHAGAN Attaboy , Babe ! SHEILA LAVERY ( to BABE ) Would you be interested in knowing exactly what you can do , you God-damned PHYLLIS ADRIAN Now , wait a minute . You ladies and gentlemen can either behave yourselves respectably , or get the hell out of my place . SHEILA LAVERY Your place , you cheap kept woman . p. 87 JEAN DORAN Please , Phil , do n't listen to her . She does n't mean any offence . PHYLLIS ADRIAN No ? Maybe she only wants to get a few of her front teeth knocked out . JUDGE GOHAGAN ( to EMMA ) Just like so many nuns . BABE SAVITO ( to PHYLLIS ) It ai n't any of my doing  --  and I want to apologize to you , Phil . SHEILA LAVERY How charming of you . BABE SAVITO But I just want to tell you , that if there 's going to be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get two words out of that Wop mouth of yours without one of them being " sock " ? JEAN DORAN Oh , darling  --  lay off ! MILT FLIESLER ( coming in excitedly ) Say , everybody ! Look out the window . You can see the big Zeppelin . ( He has rushed to the window . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN We 've seen it . Now are you going to cut it out , or go home  --  which ? ( This is addressed to SHEILA , who does n't deign to reply. ) p. 88 BABE SAVITO It 's all the same with me . ( He wolfs a sandwich . SHEILA sits down on the couch and lights a cigarette . ) JEAN DORAN Darling  --  you must n't be like this . JUDGE GOHAGAN ( singing ) " Happy Days are here again  --  cha , cha , cha , cha " ( He jazzes off into the dining room . ) MILT FLIESLER ( still at the window ) Jeez  --  how 'd you like to cross the ocean in one of them ? Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you staring at ? EMMA KRULL I beg your pardon  --  I PHYLLIS ADRIAN ( to SHEILA ) Get out of here ! BABE SAVITO All I ask is just one sock . PHYLLIS ADRIAN You heard me . SHEILA LAVERY I 'll be glad to let you know when I 'm ready to leave . BABE SAVITO Just one  --  that 's all I ask . JEAN DORAN Oh  --  this is terrible ! p. 89 PHYLLIS ADRIAN Are you going to walk , or do you have to be thrown ? SHEILA LAVERY If I 'm not mistaken , you 've been kicked out of here yourself . ( All of this has been jumbled together in the general heat . ) JEAN DORAN ( jumping up , with appalling gaiety ) I tell you what . Let 's have a little cheerful music . ( She starts singing jazzily herself as she turns on the radio . ) BABE SAVITO I 'd hate to sock a woman , but you 're different . SHEILA LAVERY ( with a merry laugh ) Of course  --  the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( from the radio ) Europe is pouring her poison into the life blood of America  --  and that infection , my friends , is entering through this open wound  --  New York ! ( Applause . ) JEAN DORAN You do n't tell me so . ( She turns the dials until she has picked up Rudy Vallee 's band playing something or other . ) There  --  is n't that better ? I 'll tell you what , everybody . Let 's roll back the carpets and have a little stepping , what do you say ? Huh ? ( There are a series of violent rings on the door-bell . ) Say ! Maybe that 's Harry now . I hope he left the storm upstairs . ( She goes to the hall door. ) p. 90 PHYLLIS ADRIAN If it 's Clarisse , you let me handle her . JEAN DORAN Come on in , Harry , you big stupe ! MILT FLIESLER Say  --  you 're all missing it ! It 's right over the Sherry-Netherlands . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Now listen , Emma . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My God ! It 's a raid ! ( She retreats hastily . PETE , a detective , comes in , followed by CONWAY , a traffic officer . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN What do you want ? PETE Is Glassman here ? JEAN DORAN No  --  he 's upstairs . He lives in the penthouse . PETE We 've just been there and he ai n't at home . Where is he ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Who are you ? ( An elevator boy , terribly scared , has come in in the wake of the cops . ) PETE I 'm a policeman , madam . PHYLLIS ADRIAN In that case , probably you can tell me what business you 've got coming into my apartment . p. 91 PETE ( to the ELEVATOR-MAN ) Who is this ? ELEVATOR-MAN It 's Miss Adrian . She 's the tenant here . PETE Oh , Miss Phyllis Adrian . Quite a public character . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Have you got a warrant that lets you break into a private home ? PETE No  --  I ai n't got any warrant . PHYLLIS ADRIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kind of fresh , eh ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Yes , and what 's more , I 'll tell you something . You 'd better be careful how you talk to me , because I happen to be a personal friend of the mayor of this city . PETE Well , who is n't ? Where 's Glassman ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN How should I know ? PETE That 's your problem . But he ai n't in his own place , and he ai n't left this building  --  at least , so far as the operator knows . We 'd better take a look around , Con . CONWAY O. K. ( He starts toward the dining room . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN He 's in the bedroom . p. 92 PETE In there ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Yes . PETE Bring him out , Con . ( CONWAY goes out at the left . PETE produces his note-book . ) Now  --  if no one objects , I might take a few names . ( He looks at MILT . ) Who are you ? MILT FLIESLER John Smith . PETE No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAVITO . ) Hi , Babe . BABE SAVITO Hi . ( The radio has been going all this time , the orchestral part having given way to Rudy 's inevitable solo . ) PETE Now there 's one guy I do n't want to hear from is Rudy Vallee . Turn that off . ( Someone turns it off . GLASSMAN comes in , followed by CONWAY . ) Good evening , Harry . HARRY GLASSMAN Good evening , Pete . What 's the idea ? PETE How long have you been down here ? HARRY GLASSMAN I do n't know . PETE You 'd better know . HARRY GLASSMAN Fifteen or twenty minutes , I guess . p. 93 PETE Can you prove that ? HARRY GLASSMAN Prove what ? What are you getting at , Pete ? What 's wrong ? PETE Your servants upstairs did n't see you leave the apartment . HARRY GLASSMAN They were n't there . They were down here , helping . ( The JUDGE comes in with a highball . ) JUDGE GOHAGAN Well , have you sweethearts settled your PETE Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off here ? HARRY GLASSMAN Miss Peretti was up there . She saw me go . She 'll tell you . PETE Miss Peretti ai n't telling . And she ai n't going to . HARRY GLASSMAN ( scared ) What 's the matter with her ? PETE She 's dead . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Oh ! ( PATROLMAN KAVANAUGH , a thin cop , ambles in . ) JUDGE GOHAGAN You mean she 's dead ? HARRY GLASSMAN She killed herself . PETE ( looking at his watch ) A little over ten minutes ago she hit the pavement , on Eighth Avenue , after having fallen twenty-one stories . p. 94 HARRY GLASSMAN Do n't tell me about it . I do n't want to hear it . JUDGE GOHAGAN Take it easy , Harry . ( To PETE . ) Well  --  what of it ? PETE This officer and I saw her land . The doorman identified her , and we went up to apartment 21-B . There were signs of a struggle all over the place . HARRY GLASSMAN She was crazy , Pete . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for doing a thing like that when she was crazy . PETE I said  --  there were signs of a struggle , especially right around the only window in the apartment that was open . It looked a lot to me as if the girl had been fighting for her life . ( Another patrolman , SZTINECK , comes in . ) HARRY GLASSMAN ( approaching PETE ) What are you saying ? Are you trying to tell me that I could do a thing like ? JUDGE GOHAGAN I 'll be going . HARRY GLASSMAN And leave me to get myself out of this the best way I JUDGE GOHAGAN What 's the matter with you ? Have the guts fallen down on you ? ( He turns to PETE . ) Now , ask plenty of questions  --  and take your time about it . Do you get me ? p. 95 PETE O. K. , Judge . ( The JUDGE goes . ) HARRY GLASSMAN Go ahead . Get out of it , you yellow son of PHYLLIS ADRIAN Keep quiet , Harry . He knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a party going on upstairs , and then it moved down here . Everybody in this room can tell you everything that happened up to the time Clarisse was left alone , which she wanted to be . PETE ( to the ELEVATOR-MAN ) Did you bring any of these people down in the car ? ELEVATOR-MAN Well  --  first I brought Babe Savito , and that lady over there . Then there was another ring , and I brought him , and her and the judge ( indicating MILT and SHEILA ) , and a couple of others that did n't get off here . PETE Was Glassman with them ? ELEVATOR-MAN No , sir . I did n't see him . PETE How 'd you get down , Harry ? HARRY GLASSMAN I walked down . JEAN DORAN It 's only two flights . PETE ( to JEAN ) Were you here when he came in ? p. 96 JEAN DORAN Well , I  --  I was n't exactly in this room . PETE Where were you ? JEAN DORAN In the dining room , having a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAVITO I was in there , too . And the door was closed . Somebody shut it . PETE Anybody else with you ? JEAN DORAN ( indicating SHEILA ) This lady was with us , and so was the judge . MILT FLIESLER And so was I. JEAN DORAN We did n't have the faintest idea of what was going on . PETE ( to GLASSMAN ) Well ! It looks like everybody was somewhere else at the crucial moment . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I was here , you fat-head . I had a long talk with him . PETE You were the only one ? EMMA KRULL No  --  I was PHYLLIS ADRIAN You keep out of this . You 're not needed . PETE What were you saying ? EMMA KRULL I was here all through it . It was easily twenty minutes ago when this gentleman came in. p. 97 PETE Who are you ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Her name 's Jessup . PETE What ? EMMA KRULL Jessup  --  Florence Jessup . PETE Where do you live ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN She comes from out West . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose . ( He glances around at the assemblage . ) Well , Harry  --  you 've got two nice alibis . But we 'll have to wait and see just how much they 're good for . In the meantime , I think we 'd all better take a little taxi ride over to West 68th Street and talk things over . Want to get your coat and hat ? HARRY GLASSMAN Yes . They 're upstairs . PETE Go with him , Con . I 'll be up in a minute . HARRY GLASSMAN ( at the door ) Say , Pete . She  --  she is n't up there ? PETE No . ( As GLASSMAN is going out with CONWAY , JOE comes in  --  startled , of course , at the array of blue uniforms . ) PETE Who 's this ? You 're a little late for the party . p. 98 JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . What 's happened ? Who was it that they were ( He makes a sort of gesture toward the street below . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN No  --  from her place . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . ( seeing EMMA ) Emmy ! What in the name of God are you doing here ? EMMA KRULL I 'm sorry , Joe . PETE Emmy ! ( He looks at his note-book . ) Is that short for Florence ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . ( to PETE ) She has n't got anything to do with this . She does n't know any of these people . EMMA KRULL I have to tell him , Joe . I was here . ( Two REPORTERS rush in , one of them with a camera . ) CAMERA-MAN Hello , Pete  --  can we get any pictures ? REPORTER ( looking around ) My God , Ben  --  look who 's all here . It 's an orgy . PETE Keep ' em quiet , Kav. p. 99 KAVANAUGH Come on , boys  --  you 'll have to wait . BABE SAVITO ( ferocious ) You ai n't got no excuse to get me into this . PETE Do n't get excited , Babe . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to get things a little straighter . Will all of you kindly line up over there ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN You need n't think you 're kidding anybody with all this . ( She crosses to join the frightened group before the window . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . She does n't know a damned thing about this . You do n't have to PETE Get over there . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Look here , officer  --  ( he speaks to PETE in an undertone )  --  my name is Gresham , and I 'll be glad to fix this up PETE You need n't bother about me . I 'm not important enough to be bribed . Get over there . EMMA KRULL It 's no use , Joe . I 've got to do it . ( She goes over to join the line . JOE reluctantly follows . ) PETE Now  --  we 're going to take down all the names  --  and this time , we 're going to have only the right names . Who are you ? p. 100 MILT FLIESLER Milton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heights . I go to N. Y. U. I live with my mother . PETE That 's great . And you ? SHEILA LAVERY Sheila Lavery  --  Hotel Belgrave  --  Madison Avenue at 76th Street . PETE And you ? JEAN DORAN Jean Doran , 365 East 49th Street . ( She has been sobbing softly . Now she bursts into hysterical laughter . ) PETE Ah  --  shut her up ! And Babe Savito . And how about you , Miss Jessup ? What 's your name ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Do n't tell him . PHYLLIS ADRIAN She gave her right name the first time . PETE Just repeat it  --  because I want to be sure to have it straight when they call you for the Homicide Bureau . EMMA KRULL It 's Emma Krull  --  Sioux Falls , South Dakota . ( The CAMERA-MAN has been furtively focussing his camera . There is a sudden flash-light explosion. ) p. 101 PETE What the hell ! I thought I told you guys REPORTER It 's all right , Pete . Just a little group . PETE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last name ? EMMA KRULL K-R-U-L-L . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh  --  God  --  almighty ! ( It 's a species of moan . EMMA pats his hand , which is on her shoulder. ) @x SCENE : The same as Act II , an hour or so later . There are some half-empty glasses about , and many teeming ash-trays . LUCILLE is cleaning up the mess in a rather desultory manner , dumping the ash-trays on to a large tray which she carries . PATROLMAN KAVANAUGH is listening to the radio , his ear close to the loud speaker , from which is issuing a virtually inaudible murmur . He is solemnly eating a sandwich . LUCILLE makes something of a clatter with her work . KAVANAUGH Keep quiet ! ( LUCILLE suspends her operations for the moment . ) Yeh  --  I was right . It 's KMOX , St. Louis . LUCILLE ( resuming ) That 's nothin ' . We get Denver any time we want it . ( The telephone rings . LUCILLE puts down her tray and starts toward it . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone . ) Yeh . Who ? No  --  there 's nobody here just now . All right . Who ? Senator who ? Is that a State senator , or one of the other ones ? Yeh . Yeh . O. K. I 'll tell her . ( He hangs up. ) p. 103 LUCILLE Was that the Senator wanting his daughter ? KAVANAUGH Nah  --  it was some newspaper man . ( He takes a sandwich from the platter , which is still on the table , and bites into it . ) These sandwiches is stale . LUCILLE Had I better send out to Reuben 's ? KAVANAUGH ( back at the radio ) Hey  --  listen ! They 're playing " Little White Lies . " ( He starts to dance with an imaginary partner . ) LUCILLE They play it better in Denver . ( The front door is heard to open , and PHYLLIS comes in , followed by EMMA , JOE and PATROLMAN SZTINECK . PHYLLIS goes to the radio and turns it off . ) SZTINECK Hi , Kav . KAVANAUGH Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Phil ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN To the station house . We registered on the blotter . KAVANAUGH Is one of you Miss Krull ? EMMA KRULL Yes  --  I am . ( LUCILLE goes out with the tray , on which she has placed the mess . JOE has sat down on the couch , his hat still on . He is not cheerful. ) p. 104 KAVANAUGH Well  --  some guy named Hauser from The Telegram called up to say he located your father . EMMA KRULL Where  --  at the hotel ? KAVANAUGH Nah  --  he 's been over to the station house , too , with your mother . Only they got into the wrong one , West 47th Street . EMMA KRULL Poor pop ! Does he know where I am ? KAVANAUGH That Telegram guy said to tell you he 'd keep in touch . EMMA KRULL Thanks . PHYLLIS ADRIAN All I ask is you do n't have the family reunion in here . SZTINECK You do n't have to stick here any longer , Kav . The big chief 's on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then come down and ask you folks a few questions . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Tell him to make it fast , because we ca n't sit up all night . KAVANAUGH I 'll see that he gets your message . ( SZTINECK goes out . KAVANAUGH takes another sandwich and is about to follow him . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . And tell those cops down in the lobby to shoot any newspaper men that try to get up here . p. 105 KAVANAUGH I 'd be glad to . EMMA KRULL Except that Mr. Hauser from The Telegram . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Yes  --  we 'll see him . KAVANAUGH O. K. , ladies . ( He goes out . EMMA goes over to the mirror , at the left , to do some work on her appearance . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Do n't you want to go into my room , Em , darling ? EMMA KRULL Thanks , I will . ( She goes out at the left , amazingly unperturbed . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN ( to JOE ) Take your hat off . ( He takes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want a drink ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Yes . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Lucille ! ( To JOE . ) Scotch ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I think I 'd rather have a cup of coffee . ( LUCILLE comes in . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Bring a lot of coffee . LUCILLE And some scrambled eggs and bacon ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Want any eggs , Joe ? p. 106 JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . No ! PHYLLIS ADRIAN Just the coffee , Lucille . ( LUCILLE goes . PHYLLIS looks at JOE . ) Now , listen  --  there 's no excuse for you to sit there looking as if this was your private funeral . It 's a tough break for everybody . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . As though I give a damn what happens to Harry Glassman , or any of that outfit  --  PHYLLIS ADRIAN Well  --  I guess it has n't been any fun for her , either . ( With a gesture toward the left . ) But have you heard her say one word of complaint ? You have not . JOSEPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what it is to be a good sport . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Just what you crave , is n't she ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . ( rising and pacing ) Why did she come here ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Do n't ask me . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I 'm not asking you . I 'm talking to myself . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Are you keeping yourself interested ? ( The telephone rings . PHYLLIS answers it . ) Hello . What ? Yes , certainly . You can get all the pictures of me you want in the art department of the Metropolitan Museum . ( She hangs up . ) Listen , Joe  --  you 're not going to take it out on her just because there was an accident . p. 107 JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . She was a crazy fool to step into this mess . PHYLLIS ADRIAN No , she was n't . She was smart . She wanted to see something of the surroundings in which you grew up . There are n't many girls , getting married , who have sense enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bill . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I hope she learned a lot . PHYLLIS ADRIAN She 'll always learn . And if it had n't been for for what happened  --  I 'll bet anything she 'd have done what she really came here for . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . What ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN To save you a lot of money . She 'd have got me to come down in my price . I 've got to hand it to you , Joe . You certainly do pick clever girls  --  JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Yes  --  I run to the peaceful , homey type . PHYLLIS ADRIAN And I would n't be surprised if this last one turned out to be the flower of the flock . But if you split up with her , I advise you next time to get somebody dumb . You 'll find it a lot safer . ( EMMA comes in . ) EMMA KRULL How long do you suppose we 'll have to wait ? p. 108 PHYLLIS ADRIAN There 's no way of telling . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wo n't make any trouble , will he ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Oh  --  he 'll make a big splurge , for the sake of publicity . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . They have n't got any chance of proving it was n't suicide . PHYLLIS ADRIAN No ! But seeing it 's a famous racketeer like Harry Glassman , the cops will play it up big . It 'll help to take the public 's mind away from all those vanishing judges . EMMA KRULL I feel terribly sorry for Mr. Glassman . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . A worthy object of sympathy . EMMA KRULL Well , he really loved that girl . PHYLLIS ADRIAN ( to JOE ) And love is the most marvellous thing in the world , is n't it , sweets ? EMMA KRULL ( with a glance at JOE ) It ought to be . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I 'd be in more of a mood to talk about love if I could only stop thinking what the Mirror , News and Graphic will look like to-morrow . p. 109 EMMA KRULL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADRIAN I do n't know . I never even knew her right name . She told me once she came from Little Rock . Maybe she did . But do n't be thinking about her , Em . She did n't have any notion of what was happening . The condition she was in , I guess she thought she was flying , out over the trees in the park . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Like Peter Pan . ( The telephone rings . PHYLLIS goes and answers it . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN This line is busy ! ( She leaves the telephone disconnected . ) What you want to do , both of you , is learn the Broadway idea . When somebody dies , or gets killed , just tell yourself , " Well  --  when all is said and done , it 's the best thing that could have happened to poor So-and-so . " That may n't be true , but it gives you a good excuse for forgetting all about it . ( She looks at herself in the mirror at the left , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I 'd like to know , Joe . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Has n't your desire for knowledge been satisfied yet ? EMMA KRULL Why  --  why did you come back here to-night ? p. 110 JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Why indeed . EMMA KRULL Was it because you wanted to see Phil again ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Yes , it was I came back here to tell her I 'd got the money . EMMA KRULL All of it ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . All of it . One hundred thousand dollars . EMMA KRULL Joe ! How did you get it ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I went to my father . I faced it out with him . I promised him that if he 'd advance me that much , in cash , I 'd never get mixed up in any kind of scrape again . He said he 'd heard that before . Then I told him that if he did n't come through , I 'd do some things he had n't heard of . I swore to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole family  --  aunts , cousins and all . And that scared him , because he knew damned well I was capable of doing it . Well  --  I seem to have made a good start to-night . EMMA KRULL That was brave of you , dear . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . My great bravery was wasted . EMMA KRULL No , it was n't . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Everything that I 've done has been wrong , from start to finish . Well  --  anyway  --  when you see your father you can have the satisfaction of telling him that you 've learned your lesson , and that the engagement is off . p. 111 EMMA KRULL Joe ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . And you can tell him also that he 's entirely right in his opinion of me and of this rotten city . The whole place is a nightmare . EMMA KRULL But we could live somewhere else , could n't we ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . You can live wherever you want to , but not with me . EMMA KRULL Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I love you . EMMA KRULL Somehow or other , that does n't seem to follow . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I love you so much that I could n't bear to see you condemned to spend your life with a weak , ineffectual , vicious imbecile like me . ( PHYLLIS comes in . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Has n't she cooked that coffee yet ? EMMA KRULL Joe has some strange news for us , Phil . PHYLLIS ADRIAN What is it ? EMMA KRULL He went to his father , and he collected that hundred thousand dollars , to pay you off . Did you ever hear of such heroism ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN Why , Joe  --  I 'm overcome ! p. 112 JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . It 's some consolation to know that you wo n't see a nickel of it . EMMA KRULL You 're not going to pay her ? JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . After what 's happened ? It 's too late now for her to do any damage . That 's been done . The beans have been spilled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . However  --  when you want any letters of recommendation to the boys at the Racquet Club , do n't hesitate to call on me . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Just write me out a blanket endorsement  --  to whom it may concern . EMMA KRULL And what 's more , Phil  --  he 's broken off with me . PHYLLIS ADRIAN What ! EMMA KRULL He 's through with me . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Oh , he is , is he ? Well , do n't you fret about that , little girl . There 's someone I want to put you in touch with . It 's a Mr. Nicholas Pinanski , of Callahan , Pinan ( The door-bell rings . ) See who that is , Lucille . Do n't let ' em in . ( She goes to the hall entrance . ) Come on , now  --  get out of here . ( She has gone into the hall . ) We 're not seeing any What ! ( She comes back into the room . ) She 's in here . ( KRULL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KRULL ( jumping u p ) Pop ! SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We 've been trying to find you for two hours . We were shocked , stunned . We did n't know where to turn , what to do . EMMA KRULL I tried to reach you . I called the hotel , twice . MRS . KRULL Do you fully realize what it is you 've done ? EMMA KRULL It could n't be helped , Mother . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . It was my fault , Mrs. Krull . Em was only trying to SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Fault ? Fault ! What difference who 's fault it was ? All that matters is the shameful fact that my daughter EMMA KRULL Now , please , Pop ! Do n't start it now , because I just ca n't ( Nobody is being allowed to finish a sentence in the intense agitation . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . There 's no reason for you to blame Em for anything . She MRS . KRULL ( too loud ) We have no desire to hear your version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help matters at all by shouting . p. 114 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Perhaps you 'll help matters by giving us an immediate explanation of this horror . EMMA KRULL I will , Pop . I 'll explain the whole thing . But not now . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Would n't you like to sit down , Mrs. Krull ? ( PHYLLIS has been remaining discreetly out of it , but she intrudes in a commendable attempt to do some soothing . ) MRS . KRULL Thank you , no ! EMMA KRULL This is Miss Adrian  --  my mother and father . PHYLLIS ADRIAN How do you do ? I wish you 'd sit down . You must be terribly tired . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We 've come to take our daughter back to the hotel . Are you ready to go , Emma ? EMMA KRULL I ca n't leave here yet , Pop . MRS . KRULL Are you still in custody ? EMMA KRULL They told us to wait . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . The Police Commissioner is coming to ask questions . SENATOR HARVEY L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have n't heard . p. 115 MRS . KRULL And to-morrow I was to have joined my colleagues of the Daughters of the American Revolution ! EMMA KRULL You do n't need to wait here now , Mother . The Commissioner does n't want to see you . MRS . KRULL We will wait ! SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You broke your word of honor to your mother and me . EMMA KRULL I did not . MRS . KRULL You promised faithfully that you would n't see him again this evening . ( This is indicating JOE . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . She did n't , Mrs. Krull . I swear it was entirely MRS . KRULL ( scornfully ) I have said that we do not EMMA KRULL I came here by myself . Joe did n't know anything about it . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . If you 'd only let me stay there , to watch her , she would n't have stirred out of the hotel . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I suppose you 're aware that this sickening affair is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes  --  we 've had some hints of that . p. 116 MRS . KRULL Ever since we heard about it we 've been assailed by EMMA KRULL When did you hear ? MRS . KRULL Your father had barely completed his address  --  when the reporters appeared . They crawled over us like vermin , shouting that our child had been implicated in a murder , with a beer baron , and a prize-fighter , in a love nest ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . It was n't a murder . It was suicide . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL And do n't think it 's limited to the New York papers . Among the hooligans who have been following me about this city was a representative of the Associated Press . All the gruesome revelations are being flashed throughout the length and breadth of the United States . Unfortunately , your participation gives this tragedy a national significance . ( LUCILLE comes in with a tray on which are a silver coffee pot and three large cups . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Ah ! Here 's the coffee . Just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some ? MRS . KRULL ( shortly ) I do n't think so . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Senator ? ( She is pouring the coffee. ) p. 117 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL No ! I do n't want any coffee ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Neither do I , now . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Take it away , Lucille . LUCILLE Yes , Miss Phil . ( She goes . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I know perfectly well that you hold me responsible for all of this . And you 're not doing me any injustice if you do . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We 're aware of that . MRS . KRULL I think you can save yourself the effort of trying to make any explanations , young man . PHYLLIS ADRIAN ( to Mrs. KRULL ) When the whole story comes out , as it certainly will , you 'll find out that it 's really my fault that Em got mixed up in all this . You see , Mrs. Krull , the trouble with me is I 'm just the least bit mercenary . SENATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just why my daughter saw fit to enter your JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I 'll tell you who she is , Senator . She 's my  --  she was my mistress . She was blackmailing me . PHYLLIS ADRIAN That about sums me up . p. 118 EMMA KRULL And I stepped in and fixed everything . ( The door-bell rings . ) MRS . KRULL I do n't care to stay here , Harvey . LUCILLE ( coming in ) It 's that reporter  --  the one you said was O. K. PHYLLIS ADRIAN All right . Let him in . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Do we have to have a reporter ? EMMA KRULL I sent for him , Pop . He 's the one from The Telegram . He 's helping us . ( HAUSER comes in . ) HAUSER ( surprised to encounter KRULL ) Oh ! Good evening , Senator I 'm very sorry that we should meet again under such unfortunate SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL The situation calls for no comment . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . ( muttering ) If that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HAUSER I 've been down at headquarters , and I think I can assure you that everything is going to be all right . MRS . KRULL They 're going to suppress this whole scandalous-story ? p. 119 HAUSER I 'm afraid they can hardly do that . But they 'll bring in a verdict of suicide , sure . The authorities ca n't touch Harry Glassman , and they know it . However  --  the papers are bound to make a lot of noise about it , because of Glassman 's notoriety . So the police want to make a great show of investigating the matter thoroughly before they slap on the white-wash . That 's why the commissioner is taking a personal hand . It makes it look as if he meant business . ( This last is in the nature of an explanation to the senator . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL And when Tammany Hall has completed this  --  this mock display  --  will my daughter be called upon for any further participation ? HAUSER There 'll be the Homicide Bureau investigation , of course  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Miss Krull avoided that . She 's the only really respectable alibi that Glassman has got . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I love that ! HAUSER I do n't suppose , Senator , you could be induced to issue a statement on this regrettable occurrence ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I do n't suppose I could . HAUSER If I might offer a suggestion , Senator  --  it might look well if you were to say something in  --  in extenuation of your daughter 's part in this . p. 120 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Are you daring to suggest that Miss Krull requires any exten ? HAUSER Oh , no , no  --  I was only considering the possible effect on public opinion , especially out in your own section of the EMMA KRULL He has the right idea , Pop . Remember what Heflin did . MRS . KRULL All things considered , I believe you should announce that in so far as we are concerned , no disgrace whatever attaches to Emma 's name . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Very well . You can quote me as saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this emergency . ( Almost unconsciously , he takes on the manner of one who is dictating an important letter , choosing his words . ) We are aware of all the circumstances surrounding her  --  her involvement , and we are thoroughly satisfied that they reflect no discredit whatever on her character . MRS . KRULL Senator Krull is first , last and always a loving father , and I am a mother ! HAUSER That 's perfect ! ( He jots down the words " mother gag " on a wad of copy paper which he has taken from his pocket . ) SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You 'll see to it that that statement goes to the press outside New York ? p. 121 HAUSER Oh , yes , Senator . The U. P. will send it out everywhere . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL And you might add that this sordid affair only tends to confirm my previous opinions of the conditions of civilization in New York City . It 's a sewer ! PHYLLIS ADRIAN The Chicago papers will certainly print that . HAUSER Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  unless there 's anything more that I can do . EMMA KRULL Thanks . You 've been fine . HAUSER It 's been a pleasure . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . ( with a look ) Has n't it ! HAUSER Well  --  good night , everybody . ( He goes out . ) MRS . KRULL ( to EMMA ) Do you see now what you 've subjected us to ? The Homicide Bureau ! EMMA KRULL Oh , I 'm sorry , Mother . I 've done an awful thing to you and Pop . And I wo n't blame you if you disown me , cast me out . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We contemplate no such course of action . We 're going to take you home , to Sioux Falls , and we 'll face it out together  --  even if it costs me the election . p. 122 EMMA KRULL It could n't do that . You 'll be more popular than ever when the people of South Dakota see what a fine , loyal , devoted father you are . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered some good in your parents , after all these years . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL My dear child  --  I 've never had the slightest doubt in my mind that you 'd work out your destiny in the right way . I know you 're head-strong , and independent  --  but you come by it honestly . It 's the pioneer blood that flows through your veins . But now you 've witnessed a typical demonstration of their vaunted Eastern culture . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . You call this typical ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I do ! Every phase of it ! And particularly the twenty-story leap to death . And I thank God that , horrible as it is , it has given my daughter vision to see the truth . ( He addresses EMMA . ) After you 've been home a while , and got yourself back to normal , you 'll appreciate what an escape you 've had . ( KRULL is becoming increasingly pleased with the trend of the conversation . He considers that he is scoring some telling points . ) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American man , and you 'll marry him , as the good Lord meant you to . p. 123 PHYLLIS ADRIAN And raise a whole brood of candidates for the U. S. Senate . ( JOE comes down from the aloof position he had been occupying , upstage . ) JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Are you going to do that , Em ? MRS . KRULL She is ! ( She turns to KRULL . ) I approve everything you 've said , Harvey . You 're a good , Christian gentleman . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Em ! Are you going to do what your father says ? EMMA KRULL You are a Christian gentleman , Pop . You could have raved and ranted at me , and thrown me out onto the streets . Or worse , you could have said that you forgive me . But you have n't , and I 'm grateful to you , and I 'll always be grateful . But I 've said that I was going to be married to Joe , and I intend to do it even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the match . MRS . KRULL You propose to complete the disgrace that you 've started this night ? EMMA KRULL It is n't a disgrace , Mother . You said so yourself , to that reporter . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL You mean that , my daughter ? You mean that knowing what you do of his character , seeing what you have seen of his environment , you still refuse to give him up ? p. 124 EMMA KRULL Yes , Pop . I mean it . ( JOE seizes her hand and holds it tightly . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN She does , Senator . It 's that old pioneer blood . MRS . KRULL ( to KRULL ) You ca n't stand by and let this happen . You can force her to obey you , to do what you know is right . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . You ca n't force her . God only knows why she 's made this choice , but she 's made it . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL ( very tense ) You 're quite right . I ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to face the bitter fact of our own failure to hold the child that we bred . We have n't disowned her  --  but she has renounced us , and everything that we stand for . She has chosen to become an alien . So be it ! I will make no further attempt to reclaim her . Let her rot in the charnel-house that she has selected as her habitation . Come  --  we 'd better be going on . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Just a minute , Senator . I 've made every conceivable effort to ingratiate myself , and avoid any open conflict with you . I do n't seem to have been very successful . So I 'll stop being discreet just long enough to tell you that I think you damned well ought to be ashamed of yourself for talking that way to your daughter ! p. 125 EMMA KRULL You ca n't say that , Joe , because you do n't understand what 's behind my father . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I understand that statement that you gave out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive me for saying so  --  it 's bunk ! All you thought about was making a good impression on your constituents . You 'll stand up for Em , yes  --  just as long as she conforms to your South Dakota ideas of morality , just as long as she lives the kind of narrow life that EMMA KRULL Joe ! You 've got to stop that ! Do n't listen to him , Pop . He is n't being SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I am listening to him . I 'm treasuring every word he says . I am glorying in the realization that such as he is opposed in every way to such as I  --  the realization that I have been right , eternally right , when I have said that New York is not America . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Now listen JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . You keep your mouth shut . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I 've heard that crack before . Will Rogers always gets a hand with it when he 's playing Chautauqua time . Well  --  what I want to know is , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go back where you came from  --  and take your amendments with you ? p. 126 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL It 's peculiarly appropriate that the spirit of this city should find voice in one of your kind . MRS . KRULL You 're degrading yourself by entering into any discussion with her . PHYLLIS ADRIAN Why do n't you get into it yourself , Mrs. Krull ? It 's turning into a free-for-all . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL By God  --  I wish the whole pack of you would secede , and precipitate another Civil War , so that the true patriots might have an opportunity to wipe out this  --  this bawdy shambles of law-breakers , and millionaire wastrels , and drug addicts , and perverts and harlots . EMMA KRULL That 's right , Pop . Stand up to ' em . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . ( to KRULL ) I suppose there are n't any law-breakers or harlots in Sioux Falls . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL If there are , it 's because this city with its stinking money power is seducing the inherently decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Hollywood that was supposed to be doing that . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Hollywood is the illegitimate offspring of Broadway ! p. 127 PHYLLIS ADRIAN Do n't let Will Hays hear that . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Oh  --  you New Yorkers are willing enough to exploit America , to suck America 's life-blood  --  and at the same time to champion every cause that 's un-American , to flout the Constitution , to sneer at the very flag itself ! JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . Oh , for God 's sake ! Who cares what 's unAmerican and what is n't ? SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Who , indeed , in this European pig-sty ! EMMA KRULL Do n't argue , Joe . You 're not in Pop 's class as a debater . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . I do n't want to argue . ( He approaches the senator . ) I only want to agree with you , Senator , and be on your side , and admit that the whole thing is rotten , and degraded . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I do not solicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm speaking in good faith , do n't you , Mrs. Krull ? MRS . KRULL I do not ! You 'd best leave your defense to this trollop of yours . EMMA KRULL Mother ! PHYLLIS ADRIAN That 's what I am , Mrs. Krull . A hundred per cent American trollop ! p. 128 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Do n't you befoul the name of my country by mentioning it in that PHYLLIS ADRIAN Your country ! Your exclusive country ? Would you like to know where I come from , Senator ? I come from Texas . That 's in America , too . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL I take note that you 've found your own level , here . PHYLLIS ADRIAN I got here just the same way that you got to Washington . You 're not the only one who has represented the U. S. in an official way . You may not know it , but I 've been Miss America in my time . Yes , sir ! I carried the Stars and Stripes in the International Beauty Contest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been for me , the championship would have gone to Czecho-Slovakia . And then where would our great nation have been ? So maybe you 'll pay a little more attention to me when I tell you that New York is America  --  boot-leggers and millionaires and crooked politicians and all . In fact  --  that 's my chief complaint against this town . EMMA KRULL That 's enough , Phil . It 's a dirty , low trick to pick on my father . You can get him at a disadvantage  --  because he needs votes , and you do n't . MRS . KRULL ( to KRULL ) Will you please take me away from this place at once ? p. 129 EMMA KRULL No ! You 've got to listen to me , both of you ! MRS . KRULL ( almost tearful ) We 've heard about enough of cynical irreverence . We 've suffered enough humiliation . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL What have you got to say ? EMMA KRULL Just that I 'm not planning to renounce you or mother or our native land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be married , right away , and as soon as we 've attended to that , we 're going to move out to Sioux Falls , South Dakota . And when we get there , you 're going to buy a ranch ( this to JOE )  --  thousands and thousands of acres  --  thereby relieving a lot of starving farmers that are n't any too grateful to you , Pop , for what you have n't done for them . And Joe is going to give out statements to all the local papers , panning New York and explaining that he 's come out to the Great West to live , and breathe fresh air , and cleanse his system of the poison of the Big Evil City . And he 'll become a popular hero over night with all the women voters  --  your buddies , Mother  --  because there 's nothing they love so much as a New Yorker who has reformed . Joe , you 'll be adopted as a prodigal son of the prairies . You 'll wear a ten-gallon hat and make speeches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why  --  for the price of one of your race horses you could buy all the votes there are in South Dakota . And on November the fourth Senator Krull and the Republican party will ride in to victory on an overwhelming wave of public enthusiasm . ( She turns again to JOE . ) And when Election Day is over , you and I will move back and live on East 72d Street . p. 130 PHYLLIS ADRIAN You ca n't beat that , Senator . She 's got you licked  --  and on your own home grounds , too . You 're not the last politician in the Krull family . EMMA KRULL And you need n't think he 's going to let you down , Phil . He can easily spare , say , twenty-five thousand dollars . JOSEPH GRESHAM , JR . What ? PHYLLIS ADRIAN You mean I 'm to split with the Senator ? EMMA KRULL I think that 's only fair . ( The door-bell rings . ) PHYLLIS ADRIAN Twenty-five grand ! With that I could get myself a coat of Riviera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to go back into circulation . ( Looking out into the hall . ) Hello , Harry . ( GLASSMAN comes in . ) Is everything all right , Harry ? JUDGE GOHAGAN ( coming in briskly ) Everything 's lovely ! Old Harry thought I was walking out on him . As if I 'd two-time a pal ! I was just in a hurry to get things fixed , and when I say fixed , I mean ( He sees KRULL . ) Well ! Senator Krull , I believe . I 'm glad to know you , Senator . I 'm Judge Gohagan . ( He has extended his hand. ) p. 131 SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL Good evening . JUDGE GOHAGAN Great little girl you 've got there , Senator . Full of the right stuff . I regret she must be detained for questioning , but you 'll appreciate that our police force must be on the alert . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL We know all about that ! HARRY GLASSMAN ( to EMMA ) I want to thank you for the way you came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to EMMA KRULL ( hastily ) Oh , that 's perfectly all right , Mr. Glassman . JUDGE GOHAGAN As a matter of fact , Senator , there was no real need for your daughter to be dragged into this . I mean to say , if they 'd only had sense enough to leave the works to me . SENATOR HARVEY L. KRULL My daughter can stand on her own two feet , thank you ! JUDGE GOHAGAN Certainly she can . But just the same , a word or two in the right place sometimes saves a lot of trouble  --  but I guess I do n't have to tell you anything about that , huh ? ( Very knowing . ) HARRY GLASSMAN ( still to EMMA ) Maybe I 'll be able to do something for you , some time . p. 132 PHYLLIS ADRIAN You can do something for her , Harry . You can help her father get re-elected to the Senate . ( GLASSMAN has a good luck at KRULL . Then he turns to EMMA . ) HARRY GLASSMAN Do n't you worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A CAMERA-MAN comes in , bearing his camera with tripod , and saying , " Here comes the commissioner ! " On his heels comes another CAMERAMAN , also saying , " Here comes the commissioner ! " They set up their cameras .
