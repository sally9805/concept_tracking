txt The treaty between the United States and Canada to govern the development of the St. Lawrence waterway into an ocean lane and great power project was signed at a simple ceremony in the State Department at 10 o'clock this morning , thus bringing , to a conclusion diplomatic negotiations extending over eleven years . President Hoover , in a statement issued for him at the White House , hailed the treaty as of first importance to the whole continent and a i redemption of his promise made to t the mid-West that the project would be pressed to a conclusion . The State Department made public the text of the pact and issued a statement summarizing it and reviewing the negotiations . The ceremony of signing was so brief as to suggest an anti-climax , considering the long period of difficult negotiations . It required not more than two minutes and took place in the reception room of the i Secretary of State . As to the Cost of the Project . The treaty provides for a two-stage project with a 27-foot channel in the reaches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint board of engineers of the United States and Canada in 1926 of $543,429,000 . This estimate covers the distance from the Great Lakes to Montreal . It omits work already done on the river east of Montreal , as well as other developments not directly connected with the proposed improvement of the waterway . Had all these other elements been included , the estimate would have been in the neighborhood of $800,000,000 . Deducting credit for work already done , the United States ' share of the cost was estimated at about $258 , - 000,000 , less realization from waterpower projects . Immediately after the treaty was signed the State Department sent a copy of it to Senator Borah , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , so that his committee may begin hearings on it without delay . Due to the many complicated political , economic , international and engineering problems involved , a long period of exhaustive and perhaps stormy investigation is looked for , but the administration is confident that the Senate will in due time give its approval to the pact . Fight to Begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indications that all sections appear to want the treaty , with differences on points of detail only . These differences probably will be emphasized during consideration by Congress of legislation to carry out the provisions of the treaty after it has been ratified , but the opening guns are almost sure to be fired before the Foreign Relations Committee , and the general lines of the battle developed during the hearings in immediate prospect . The chief points of dispute , according to views held here , will be the division of costs , the power problem centring in the attitude of New York and the issue of the level of the Great Lakes centring in Chicago water diversion , which is governed by Supreme Court decree , as it affects not only that . city but States other than Illinois bordering on the Great Lakes . Eighteen States are more or less directly concerned in the great project . Senator Borah today declared that Governor Roosevelt will be heard by i the Foreign Relations Committee if he desires to testily on New York 's position . The State of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenditures it will be called upon to make . TEXT OF HOOVER 'S STATEMENT The President 's statement follows : The signing of the Great LakesSt . Lawrence waterway treaty marks another step forward in this , the greatest internal improvement yet undertaken on the North American Continent . The treaty must yet be ratified by the legislative bodies of the two governments and is not effective unless this is done . The treaty represents to rue the redemption of a promise which I made to the people of the Midwest . It provides for the corstruction of a twenty-seven-foot waterway from the sea to all Canadian and American points on the Great Lakes . Such a depth will admit practically 90 per cent of ocean shipping of the world to our lake cities in the States of New York , Ohio , Michigan . Indiana . Illinois , Wisconsin and Minnesota . Its influence in cheapening transportation of overseas goods will stretch widely into the interior from these points . Its completion will have a profoundly favorable effect upon the development of agriculture and industry throughout the mid-West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These benefits are mutual with the great Dominion to the north . Ten Years for Completion . The waterway will probably require ten years for completion , during which time normal growth of traffte in the nation will far more than compensate for any diversions from American railways and other American port facilities . The economic gains from improved transportation have always benefited the whole people . Under the engineers ' estimates , the total cost will be approximately $543,000,000 , of which approximately $272,000.000 will need to be expended by the United States . Some portion of these expenditures has alreaclv been made by both countries , and the actual total amount of new funds to be called on from the United States is estimated at about $258,000,000 , and from this sum nuts ' be deducted the realization which may be made from about 1,100,000 horsepower on the American side of the international section . The disposal of this power is reserved as a purely domestic question in the United States . The question of the effect of the treaty provision covering the diversion of water from Lake Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been raised . Chicago Waterway Protected . I may quote the statement I received from General , Acting Secretary of War , which clarified this question : " Dear Mr. President : " I am in receipt of your request for a statement from this department in confirmation of the verbal assurances given to you and to the Secretary of State by the corps of engineers , that the provisions in respect to the diversion of water from Lake Michigan in the proposed Great Lakes-St . Lawrence deep waterway treaty are sufficient to provide for the maintenance of the nine-foot waterway from Chicago to the Mississippi . " I am glad to confirm that the provision in the treaty does provide the necessary diversion for this purpose . " Respectfully , " DOUGLAS , " Acting Secretary of War . " The Canadian project of a twostage development in the international section has been adopted instead of the original American project of a single stage development . The cost is slightly more , but the Canadian officials have felt that the two-stage development is desirable for many reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city of Montreal . The project Is of first importance to the whole continent . The many and extremely complex engineering , legal , commercial and international problems have been worked out by the representatives of both countries in a spirit of cooperation of which all North America can be justly proud . Ceremony Quickly Over . There were no speeches and no formal congratulations as the treaty was signed with business-like dispatch . The only evidence that something unusual was in progress was the presence of newspaper correspondents and photographers . Secretary Stimson and W. D. Herridge , the Canadian Minister , signed the pact . They entered the room , sat down at a table , affixed their signatures , arose and departed . Mr. Stimson was accompanied by James G. Rogers , the Assistant Secretary of State , who had direct charge of the negotiations for the United States , and by John D. Nickerson , the Canadian expert of the State Department . Mr. Herridge was attended by Hume Wrong , counselor , and other officials of his legation . Estimates of the propect 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now lower than in 1926 , while the actual cost to the United States and Canadian Governments will be less , due first to the fact that some of the work done will fit into the great development and , second , to the pre sumption that for the power to be developed New York and Ontario will make payments . Making allowances for these considerations , it was roughly estimated today that the new outlay for work might be about $400,000,000 . Total Cost to Be Shared . Of the total estimated cost of Z543 , - 429,000 , the United States will s : end $272,453,000 and Canada $270,976.000 . A considerable part of this has already been expended in works . New construction by the United States will amount to about $258,453,00J , and by Canada to $142,976,000 . The United States ' total of S27 " . - 453,000 includes $56,500,000 for clecpeninng channels in the upper lreke- ; . providing a new lock in the St. Mary 's River near Sault Ste Hari ( , and constructing compensating works in the lakes . Of the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new funds is required . In addition , the United States ' expense will include $461,000 for deepening the river in the Thousand Islands section , which has already been appropriated , and $215,492,000 in the International Rapids section . The Canadian total of $270,976,000 includes $128,000.000 already expended on the new Welland Canal , now completed ; $59,250,000 for the International Rapids section , $772,000 for work in the Thousand Islands section and $82,854.000 for improvements in the Lake Francis .
