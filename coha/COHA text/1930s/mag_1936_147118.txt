Instead of a sweltering day in Topeka , it was a cool evening in Chicago . Instead of a rural throng of picnicking Kansans on the State House lawn , it was an urban crowd of 20,000 packed into Chicago 's enclosed Stadium. * Instead of the flat prairie voice of Alf M. Landon , it was the boom of Frank Knox . But the difference was more than a difference of weather , crowd , voice . <P> In formally accepting his nomination for the Presidency , Governor Landon chose to fight with cold water the fire of New Deal enthusiasm ( TIME , Aug. 3 ) . Against the advice of those who felt that Republicans must start a back-fire of enthusiasm , against rabid New Deal haters who wanted him to preach a holy crusade , Nominee Landon offered no burning sentiments , spoke in no burning voice . Last week in accepting the Republican Vice Presidential nomination Publisher Knox of the Chicago Daily News cut loose with a red-hot attack on the New Deal which made GOPartisans jump with joy . <P> By now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said . Last week in Chicago Nominee Knox said it all over again with a vim which so impressed the Republican National Committee that it decided to keep him almost continuously on the stump until November . Because Vice Presidents do not make national policies , he did not presume to set up a Party program but confined himself to straight-forward criticism , bold but not bitter , vigorous but not violent , scorching but not sarcastic . Excerpts : " An endless succession of interferences and experiments was inaugurated under the deceptive slogan of a new deal . This policy of government by guess , officially explained by President Roosevelt as founded on a philosophy of try-anything-once , was initiated under the title of economic planning . No one of its proponents has even been able to define the New Deal or to explain what it is aimed at or where it is going . No one of them has been able to make clear what the economic plan is . <P> It began with a proposal for a belt of trees in a territory that nature had decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of public funds to conduct classes in tap-dancing . . . . <P> " The Republican Party recognizes that changing social and economic conditions call for increased Federal activities . But it always insists that such new activities shall be legalized by proper constitutional amendment . It always will . It approves the horse-and-buggy method of changing the Constitution , and it disapproves a philosophy that laughs at the horse-and-buggy method and wants to use only the buggy whip . ... It prefers a government guided by constitutions to a government guided only by caprice . . . . Whatever concrete measures the Republican Party has in mind will be presented to the voters before election , not after . . . .
