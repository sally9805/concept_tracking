At a convention of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen at Houston last week Secretary of Labor William Nuckles Doak pulled from his pocket an old , flat , Irish potato . This , he announced , was his " magic potato . " It brought him good luck . Said he : " It is even good for neurasthenia . " <P> Secretary of Labor Doak had good reason last week to be glad of a " magic potato . " Throughout the land the following events were taking place : <P> In St. Louis when Public Service Co. announced a 10% wage-cut for its 3,500 streetcar employes , the motormen and conductors promptly voted to strike in protest . After two days of negotiations , city officials secured from the company and its men a tentative agreement to arbitrate . <P> At Mansfield , Ohio , Empire Steel Corp . ordered 15% wage-cut in its plant . Out walked 1,600 Empire workers in the first steel strike of the Depression . Three days later Empire officials rescinded their pay-cut order . The victorious strikers trooped back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike against a blanket 20% pay-cut and went back to their jobs when the contractors capitulated . <P> At Glen Falls , N. Y. , a 10% wage-cut for shirt-cutters in the Yorke , McMullen Leavens and the Bronne factories precipitated a protest strike . <P> At Pittsburgh , Vesta Coal Co . ( Jones &; Laughlin steel subsidiary ) , announced a pay-cut from $6 to $5 per day , affecting 3,000 men . <P> In New York the U. S. Lines ( Leviathan , George Washington , etc. ) cut all salaries over $150 per month by 10% . Affected were 600 non-seagoing employes . <P> These and other reductions last week had spread to such an extent that William Green , conservative president of the <P> American Federation of Labor , began to talk publicly about strikes . Said he : " We feel we are being driven to the point where we must resist attempts to reduce wages , even though it may be necessary for workers to go on strike . " At the White House conferences in the first days of the Depression , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in return for Industry 's promise to maintain existing wage scales . Now he suspected Industry of beginning to break its promise . He felt labor would thus be automatically released from its no-strike pledge . Cited was the fact that the 1921 Depression produced 2,400 strikes whereas this one has witnessed less than 40 , most of them small and local-so far . At Indianapolis the national executive committee of the American Legion voted to petition President Hoover to call a nonpolitical national conference to do something about Unemployment and Depression . Legion reports to headquarters showed 6,000,000 jobless of whom 750,000 were former service men . At the White House the Hoover secretariat announced : " Mr. Hoover is as interested in maintaining the American wage scale as any man alive . " Returned to Washington , Secretary Doak took credit for settling six threatened strikes during the week , announced that any wage reductions by Industry would be considered by the Administration a violation of confidence , would justify Labor 's demand for pay increases .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
