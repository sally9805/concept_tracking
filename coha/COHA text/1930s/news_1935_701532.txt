txt Tropical trees , believed to have grown from 10 to 20 million years ago , have been found perfectly preserved in the relatively cold Idaho mountain lands . Dr. F. B. Laney , head of the University of Idaho geology department , kept secret the exact location today to ward off souvenir hunters , but said the trees resemble the bald cypress now found in Florida swamps . Sixteen carbonized logs from eight to 24 inches in diameter , some with roots exposed , were found within a space of 100 feet , Indicating the forest was thick with the now extinct species . In their place grow the pine , fir and tamarack . " Growth rings , cellular structure , even the bark in places , are well preserved , " Dr. Laney said . The trees were green before the high Cascade mountains to the west were forced up by volcanic disturbance , Dr. Laney added .
