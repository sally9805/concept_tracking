txt President Hoover was described as being " not a dry at heart " but " dry because of the prospective profit in votes , " in a letter written by Captain William H. Stayton , chairman of the board of the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment , and read at the Senate lobby hearing today during the second day of Captain Stayton ' . testimony . Captain Stayton , writing in March , 1929 , to Herbert L. Clark of Philadelphia , expressed the view that Mr , Hoover had made up his mind.that the drys " somewhat fanatically regard the wet and dry issue as being superior to all questions of government and of morals , " and that " as a matter of vote-getting he had betOr take the dry side , " since " he can get votes from the wets without espousing their cause . " The letter concluded that " nothing that has to do with right and wrong or with facts will make any impression upon him . " Another letter read today and applauded by the audience referred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The letter , taken from the files of the wet association , was written by Representative Peavey of Wisconsin . Heflin and Sheppard Attacked . Still another letter , written by Captain Stayton to General Lincoln C. Andrews in 1927 , referred to Senators Heflin and Sheppard and the late Senator Willis of Ohio as being " abusive men , very fond of boasting that the wets have no strength , " and charged that " they are perpetually sending out this propaganda so as to get more money out of their people . " The Supreme Court under Chief Justice Taft was characterized in one letter as " wishy-washy . " Memoranda concerning expenditures for liquor for a dinner the more in 1928 were placed in e record , but Captain Stayton denied that the association was responsible either for the dinner or for the liquor . Captain Stayton was told to appear later with information on one point in his previous testimony , after which he will be excused . This concerns a contribution of $5,000 to the association from Nicholas F. Brady of New York , which Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as his own donation . Senator Robinson told him today that he had been unable to find any report of such a contribution and asked for proof , which C-.stain Stayton said he would supply . The activities of the ' Anti-Saloon Lea r ; ue will be the subject of inquiry when the committee reconvenes on Tuesday , Senator Caraway anr ounced at the close of today 's session , but he said the selection of the first witness has not been decided upon . It is expected , however , that the witness will be the Rev. Dr .. F. Scott , general superintendent of the league . Captain Stayton 's Letter . Captain Stayton 's leter to Mr. Clark read as follows : March 19 , 1929 . Herbert L. Clark , Esq. , Locust at 16th Street , Philadelphia , Pa . Dear Mr. Clark : I am very grateful for your letter of March 12 . I am absolutely in r : cord with you as to the desirability of writing to the President , and , if you will send me a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other directors . You will recall that there were two groups formed , both headed by your directors . One group was formed by General Atterbbry and included friends around Philadelphia , while the other was a group in New York , headed by Courtland Nicoll . Both groups published the fact that they were wet and that they were affiliated with this association , but they did not believe Mr. Hoover to be a dry and would therefore support him . It seems to me highly important that those groups recall to Mr. Hoover the attitude they took prior to election . - * -* S * From what I hear , Mr. Hoover has made up his mind that the drys are of that temperament which Impels them to somewhat fanatically regard the wet and dry issue as being superior to all questions of government and of morals , and that , consequently , a dry will always scratch from the ticket a man who does not do lip service to the dry cause . At the same time Mr. Hoover , I learn , believes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks that he can get votes from the wets without espousing their cause , and that , therefore , as a matter of vote-getting , he had better take the dry side . If he were sincerely a dry , one might hope to convince him by argument or statement of facts , but as I know that he Is not at heart a dry I fear that I must approach the conclusion that he is a dry because of the prospective profit in votes , and nothing that has to do with right and wrong or with facts will make any impression upon him . Sincerely yours , WILLIAM H. STAYTON . Senators Termed " Abusive . " An indication that Captain Stayton had cooperated with General Andrews , former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , at General Andrews 's request , in pushing legislation regarding medicinal liquor , was contained in a letter from Captain Stayton to General Andrews in January of 1927 , which also contained the following discussion of the Senate : " In that body there are a few abusive men like Willis , Heflin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wets have no strength whatever ; that the drys control 90 votes out of 96 , or some other fool statement , and they are perpetually sending out this propaganda in the form of speeches so as to get more money out of their people . " " Do you want that charge to stand ? " Senator Caraway asked . " Yes , sir , " Mr. Stayton replied . " You say their purpose is get more money Irom their people ? " " That is what I meant . " " Do you believe that ? " " Yes , I do . " " What speech did Senator Sheppard ever make on which you could , with any kind of a show of self-respect , make that charge ? " " I think most of his speeches justify that , " said Captain Stayton . Senator Caraway quoted Captain Stayton 's letter further that " they have not been fair and square about it , but quite partisan and untruthful about it . " " You want that charge to stand ? " asked Senator Caraway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The examination of Captain Stayton covered a large file of letters and other material , including some penciled slips bearing notations of money presumably spent for liquor , which were attached to correspondence regarding a dinner at the University Club in Baltimore on Friday , April 13 , 1928 , at which former Senator Wadsworth was the principal speaker . These slips were examined in detail by Senator Caraway , three of them indicating original quantities , the amounts returned , and finally the bill , which was $76.50 . This represented , the slips were interpreted as meaning , three bottles of gin , one bottle of vermouth , twelve of champagne , three of Scotch and one of " liquor . " Stayton Denies Buying Liquor . Following the reading of the slips Senator Blaine , while looking at a letter which was not entered in the record , asked Captain Stayton : " Mr. Stayton , have you any knowledge or information as to whether or not the liquor that is listed on the loose slips here which the chairman read was served at a ? dinner evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States just prior to June 20 , 1928 ? " " I have no personal knowledge , sir , " Captain Stayton answered . " You have no personal knowledge ? " " I was not present at such a dinner , sir . " " Was there such a dinner held ? " " Yes , there was such a dinner held , " Captain Stayton  --  admitted , but he added that the association did not purchase liquor and he did not know whether any had been bought , or if any was bought , who bought it . A qualification of Captain Stayton 's testimony yesterday that six members of the Cabinet believe prohibition a failure was noted today , when Chairman Caraway said a friend of Secretary Davis had protested at Mr. Davis 's being named among the six . Captain Stayton pointed out that he at first had said Secretary Davis was wet , and then added , " not wet hardly . " References in letters by Captain Stayton to " packages " brought out another long series of questioning , culminating in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain was carrying on a correspondence last year in an effort to obtain the appointment of Professor C. W. C. Schantz as superintendent of schools at Wilmington , Del. , the activities indicated by the letters including conferences with Irenee du Pont . One of the letters , addressed to G. T. Barnhill Jr . at Wilmington , stated : " It may be that I have another package , but as to that I am not sure . If it has been consumed , bully for you . " Says Package Contained Brandy . " What was in that package ? " Senator Caraway asked Captain Stayton , " I should say that referred to peach ? , " he began . " Cough drops ? " asked Senator Caraway . " No , peach brandy , " replied the witness . Mr. Barnhill wrote to Captain Stay ton : " There is another one of the large packages remaining , and I think one or two of the smaller ones . If you come to Wilmington during the week of July 22 , Mr. Abberger is familiar with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abberger ? " asked Senator Caraway . " He is the local secretary in Wilmington of the Delaware Association . " " And to qualify for that job he has to be an expert on packages ? " " Not necessarily , but it is convenient , " answered Captain Stayton . This letter to Mr. Barnhill urged the selection of Professor Schantz " in order to establish contact with the school system in Wilmington , and thereby prevent the teaching of dry propaganda originating with the Anti-Saloon League and kindred organizations . " " The Supreme Court , under Chief Justice Taft , was described as being " as wishy-washy as was his administration in the Presidential office ; " in another letter from Captain Stayton to Henry Alan Johnston of New York , written on March 13 , 1929 , and it was suggested that " we might wait until time and nature make some changes in the personnel . " Captain Stayton again denied that his organization had supplied liquor for a dinner , when the correspondence revealed a letter from Emory W. Clark of Detroit , dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for men only in New York the other evening , where the Statue of Liberty was made the butt and ' Uncle Sam ' ridiculed , was , to say the least , an unfortaunate affair . If there is to be a revolution in this country , let us approach it with a calm and sane mind . " This affair , Captain Stayton told Senator Caraway , was not in any way connected with the association . Much of the correspondence dealt with other matter of the same nature as those noted , and one , written by Arthur W. Machen , former president of the Maryland division of the association , contained a forecast of possible revblution , saying : " If the dry tyranny is not overthrown by ballots now it is bound to be destroyed by bullets hereafter . The patriots must be up and stirring while peaceful means are still possible . Maryland is a small but strategically important part of this great battle . It is vital that no backward step be taken here . " Replying to Senator Robinson , who interrupted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain Stayton said he certainly did not subscribe to such a view of the situation . Mr. Machen 's letter continued : " Throughout this land the spirit of liberty is stirring . ' Caesar had his Brutus , Charles I his Cromwell , and Herbert Hoover may profit by their example . ' "
