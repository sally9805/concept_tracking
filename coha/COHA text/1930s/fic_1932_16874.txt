The rest of the available space is filled with a crowd of two or three hundred cab drivers , with perhaps a sprinkling of wives and sweethearts . At one end is an impromptu platform constructed of rough planking , on the front of which is draped an American flag . Seated on the platform are , on one side , Danny , Skeet and Slats . On the other are a man with dark glassos , a woman holding a baby , Sue and Ruby . Matt is standing in the center of the platform , in the midst of an impassioned harangue . He is unused to oratory , so his voice and manner are somewhat theatrical and declamatory . &nbsp; MATT NOLANNow , fellows , I ca n't see there 's any use in our stallin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm puttin ' it right up to you .

Well , we ca n't have old Pop with us tonight , leading the fight , but we got his daughter .... ( indicates Sue ) Fellows , Sue Riley is going to say something to you . I want you to listen and I 'm sure she 's got something hot to say . She 's got a personal interest in all this .

I even egged him on ... ( she sucks in her breath ) ... why , if Dad had n't shot that man  --  maybe I would have shot him myself ! The audience buzzes approvingly , and a few men applaud . Matt beams . Sue pauses for their attention , then continues in a higher key , as if she were restraining her emotions at great effort . &nbsp; SUE RILEYA short time ago I would have felt the same way , Mr. Nolan does ....

This ai n't a matter for a woman ... &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( excitedly ) Is that so ? How about Mrs. Kelly ? How about me ? Do you think we can stand by and see everything happen to the people we love ?

We PAN across showing the rest of the audience ; Ruby , Skeet , Slats , in fact all of Matt 's intimate friends and a dozen or more drivers in uniform . As the priest concludes . CUT TO : 82 : LONG SHOT Of a line of Independent Taxicabs , driving out of a cemetery . CUT TO : 83 : MATT 'S CAB DRIVING ALONG It is being driven by Slats . Matt and Sue being seated in the rear . Matt 's expression is frozen with grief . At length , Sue takes his hand , her eyes brimming with tears ;  --  58  --  &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( tenderly ) Please , Matt ... I know what you 're thinking ... but do n't think it ... please ! Matt 's face works peculiarly , and his mouth grows taut . Sue is frightened . She knows what he is thinking about . &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( pleading ) That wo n't bring Danny back ... Do n't look that way , Matt . Matt makes no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , like a man with the thought of murder in his mind . His hands twitch nervously . FADE OUT . FADE IN  --  59  --  84 : OFFICE OF CHIEF OF DETECTIVES Matt is being questioned concerning the identity of Danny 's murderer . He is perspiring , but obviously unyielding . On one side is Father Nulty , on the other the Chief . Flanking him are two police officers in shirt sleeves . A stenographer sits at the end of the desk . &nbsp; FATHER NULTY ( gently and persuasively ) Come now , Matt .... be sensible about this ... I 've known , you since you were a little boy , and you can trust me to advise you right ... toll them who it was , Matt my boy ..... Matt shakes his head resolutely . Nulty steps back , wiping his brow . &nbsp; CHIEF ( shaking his head ) I ca n't figure you out . A man murders your brother  --  your pal  --  and you wo n't tell us who he is . The murderer ca n't be a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOLAN ( eyes flashing ) I ai n't shielding him ... and you 'll find that out some day ! &nbsp; CHIEFSo you do know who he is ? &nbsp; MATT NOLANNo , I do n't ! One of the officers , an ignorant fellow of the bruiser type , leans forward . &nbsp; OFFICERYou ought to come clean , Nolan . You may get it the same as your brother did . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( disdainfully ) I 'll take my chances . The chief motions the policeman away .  --  60  --  &nbsp; FATHER NULTYDo n't you understand , we 're all working toward the same goal . We want the murderer of your brother brought to justice ... &nbsp; CHIEFI 'll guarantee you , he 'll pay the penalty . &nbsp; MATT NOLANYour penalty is too good for that rat . &nbsp; CHIEF ( straightening up with finality ) Well , someone else will tell us if you wo n't  --  and everything will be even . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( straightening up ) It wo n't be even for Danny and me . The chief shrugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows behind him . Simultaneously , we see another door open into the office and Slats , in cab driver 's uniform , is let in . He sees Matt , but Matt does n't see him . Matt exits with the priest . &nbsp; CHIEF ( motioning to chair ) Sit down , O'Brien . Slats obeys , his manner is timid and very shifty . &nbsp; CHIEF ( after a moment 's deliberation ) You were at the Cotton Pickers ' Club the night Danny Nolan was killed , were n't you ? &nbsp; SLATS ( quickly ) I was there , but I did n't see who did it . &nbsp; CHIEFWe know who did it , all right ... Matt just told us , and he told us you were there . We called you in because we need more than the testimony of one man . &nbsp; SLATS ( becoming confused ) Well , if Matt told you Gerard did it , I ai n't got no reason for holding out .  --  61  --  &nbsp; CHIEF ( ironically , with a wink to the stenographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right. I just ' wanted to be sure that you saw the actual killing . &nbsp; SLATS ( leaning back in his chair with self assurance ) Sure , I seen it and believe me he had no right to give it to a nice fellow like Danny . He come in drunk , this Buck , insultin ' everybody ... even Sue ... on their weddin ' night ... Matt did n't want no fight that night , but when Buck starts the trouble , all Danny does is go to help Matt ... Danny had no gun or knife or nothin ' ... this Buck just gives it to him . The stenographer has been writing this down . The Chief takes the testimony , puts it before Slats and hands him a pen . &nbsp; CHIEFJust sign that and raise your right hand . FADE OUT . FADE IN  --  62  --  Section Details 85 : ATTIC OF ROOMING HOUSE EARLY MORNING It is a large irregular room , sparingly and poorly furnished . A mattress and springs in one corner constitutes an improvised bed . The sole illumination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed . Next to the lamp a cheap alarm clock ticks monotonously . As we OPEN , Gerard is lying on the bed , playing with a black cat with a piece of string . We HOLD on him in a CLOSE SHOT to get across the effect of great monotony and nervous waiting . His grim idling is interrupted by a soft knock at the door . He listens , stiffening ... the knock is repeated ... he gets up and moves toward the door , his hand at his back pocket . &nbsp; BUCK ( in low voice ) Who is it ? &nbsp; MARIE 'S VOICES ( off scene ) It 's me , Buck . He unlocks the door and opens it to admit her ; locking the door again immediately . Her arms are laden with two or three large paper bags . &nbsp; BUCK ( unpleasantly ) What 's been keepin ' you ? You been gone an hour . She rests the bags on the table and commences taking out an assortment of little paper buckets , paper pie plates , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just had a lot of stuff to get , that 's all . He fusses over the food  --  peeking into the buckets and apparently looking for something . &nbsp; MARIEWhat are you looking for ?  --  63  --  &nbsp; BUCK ( disagreeably ) Cigarettes . What do you suppose ? I ai n't had one in a couple of hours . &nbsp; MARIE ( unhappily ) Oh , I forgot them , Buck . I was nervous , I guess . &nbsp; BUCKAbout what ? ( she is embarrassed ) About what ? ... What 's happened ? She extracts a newspaper from under her coat . &nbsp; MARIE ( almost inaudibly ) Bad news . He seizes the paper and steps over near the lamp to read It . CUT TO : 86 : CLOSE UP OF NEWSPAPER SHOOTING OVER BUCK 'S SHOULDER The headlines read : " KILLER OF DANNY NOLAN REVEALED " PAN DOWN TO Sub-headline , which reads : " Witness to Stabbing Names Murderer " PAN DOWN TO Strip , which begins : " City wide search began this morning for the killer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the assassin , or of his accuser , but feel confident of his capture within forty-eight hours ..... CUT TO :  --  64  --  87 : GERARD Who is deeply shaken by the information . &nbsp; MARIE ( patting his arm ) Do n't worry , Buck . She starts for the door . He looks after her quizzically . &nbsp; BUCKWhere you goin ' ? &nbsp; MARIEI 'm going after the cigarettes . ( she opens the door ) Lock the door after me . She exits . Buck , still holding the paper , locks the door ... then suddenly unlocks it and calls hoarsely after her . &nbsp; BUCKMarie ! .... Marie ! &nbsp; MARIE 'S VOICE ( off scene ) ( muffled ) Yes . &nbsp; BUCKHurry back with them smokes , will ya ? He walks to the bed , and In a MEDIUM SHOT in which the cat is cut off by the bed , he kicks out viciously . We hear the shriek of the cat in pain . FADE OUT . FADE IN  --  65  --  88 : THE TENEMENT FLAT OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests in the center . Sue is preparing the evening meal , while Ruby wanders about the room , inspecting the furniture and babbling incessantly . &nbsp; RUBY ( standing appraisingly before the divan ) You get this at Lacy 's basement too ? ( she nods ) Looks like Fifth Avenue to me ... That just shows what you can pick up by not bein ' proud . The trouble with most people is they 're ashamed to go shoppin ' in basements . And they miss some swell bargains ..... She pauses , and a faraway look comes into her eyes . She continues dreamily . &nbsp; RUBYIt ai n't what you buy , honey .... it 's the sentiment ... Take poor Pitzie  --  the guy I used to go with . ( lowers her voice ) I never told you this before , Sue ... but you know what ? We was shoppin ' around for furniture just like you and Matt. ( she smirks ) Pitzie used to say we was feathering our love nest .... and we picked out a lotta swell stuff , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the trouble was , the check Pitzie give ' em was no good ... ( disconsolately ) So we had to give up the idea .... The door opens suddenly and Matt comes in , just as Ruby is finishing her speech . He looks at her unpleasantly . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( as he enters ) You still babbling ? &nbsp; RUBYWhy , I have n't said a word . Matt sniffs and goes into bedroom . &nbsp; RUBY ( suddenly reminded ) Oh , I forgot what I came for . Can I have an egg , Sue ? I wan na wash my hair .  --  66  --  &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( getting an egg ) Sure . One enough ? &nbsp; RUBY ( taking egg ) Thanks . ( climbing up onto fire-escape ) Matt comes out of the bedroom wiping his hands on a towel . &nbsp; MATT NOLANSupper ready , honey ? &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( taking his arm ) All ready to sit down , dear . A knock is heard at the door . Sue crosses and admits Father Nulty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; NULTY ( stepping inside ) Hello , Sue , my child . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( rising ) Hello , Father . &nbsp; NULTY ( hesitating , apologetically ) I did n't know you were eating . I 'll drop in some other time . &nbsp; MATT NOLANThat 's all right . I ai n't so hungry . &nbsp; SUE RILEYWill you have some coffee with us , Father ? &nbsp; NULTY ( shaking his head ) No thank you . I just stepped in a minute to bring Matt this catalogue . ( takes a small booklet from his pocket and hands it to Matt ) I got it from Murphy and Lombardi . Their prices are reasonable and they do good work .  --  67  --  Matt is thumbing through the catalogue , deeply interested . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( regretfully ) I 'd like to get the best , Father ... ( frowns ) ... but it looks like they run pretty high . &nbsp; NULTY ( gently ) Danny would n't want any thing more than you can easily afford . It is n't the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .. Why do n't we go over to Lombardi 's and look them over ? &nbsp; MATT NOLANWhat 'll I say on it  --  you know , the ..... ( fishes for correct word ) &nbsp; NULTYThe epitaph ? I 'll help you figure that out ... Well , when do you want to go ? &nbsp; MATT NOLANAny time you say , Father . Tomorrow morning all right ? &nbsp; NULTYFine . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( nodding ) I 'll pick up at ten . &nbsp; NULTY ( opening door ) Goodbye , children . &nbsp; MATT NOLANGoodbye , Father . &nbsp; SUE RILEYGoodbye , Father . He exits . Matt takes Sue over to the tablo and they sit down . Sue places a plate of stew before him , and he commences to eat it voraciously . She gets her own plate , pours the coffee , then picks up a letter .  --  68  --  &nbsp; SUE RILEYYou got a letter today , Matt . He ceases eating and looks up in surprise . &nbsp; MATT NOLANA letter ? From who ? &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peters  --  out in Illinois . ( she hands it to him ; he opens it and reads ) Is n't he the fellow that runs that tourist camp ? &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( nodding as he reads ) He 's got a garage now too . ( he puts the letter down and resumes eating ) &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( curiously ) What 'd he have to say ? &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( indicating the letter with his knife ) He wants me to come out and he 'll give me half interest in the garage ... Read it . She picks it up , reads it quickly , her face lighting up . &nbsp; SUE RILEYIs n't that wonderful , Matt ! You could make enough money in a year to pay him back , he says ... ( her face clouds ) ... but do you think you could fix cars all right ? &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( disdainfully ) I ai n't been hackin ' around four years for nothin ' . &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( enthusiastically ) That 'd be swell ... We could go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see the country over since Dad used to tell me about the farm he worked on once . ( more enthusiastically , laying a hand on his arm ) Ca n't we go , dear ? You could sell your cab to raise the fare ! ...  --  69  --  &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( continuing eating ) We 're not going . &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( her face falling ) Why not , honey ? You always said you 'd , like to get out of Hew York .... &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( coldly ) Yeh  --  but right now I 've got some things to take care of . &nbsp; SUE RILEYYou mean Danny 's tombstone ? &nbsp; MATT NOLANYes  --  and some other things too . There is a lull as the two remain seated . Matt 's eyes are focused on the dishes before him . &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( sadly looking at Matt ) ( low tone ) I know what you 're thinking about ... what you 're always thinking about . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( without looking up ) You ought to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get these thoughts out of your mind .... always thinking of getting even .... brooding like you do all the time is n't going to do you any good ... Oh , Matt , honey  --  the police will eventually get Gerard ..... She tries to take Matt 's hand , but Matt stands up and pushes his chair away . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( heatedly ) The police nothing ! ... Danny was my brother ! ... I 'll handle Gerard my own way ! &nbsp; SUE RILEYI know ... I know how you feel ... but your way is the wrong way ! .. And ... it can only ruin both our lives ! ... We have each other ... our home ... we could be happy !  --  70  --  Matt has no answer . At this moment , Ruby intrudes her head in the window . At sight of her , Matt 's face takes on a look of disgust , and as Ruby starts talking , Matt plants himself in a chair and picks up a paper . &nbsp; RUBY ( apologetically ) Aw  --  Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg ... Skeet ate the other one .... ( Ruby , taking the added steps into the room ) How can a person eat a raw egg , like that ? ... and when I told him it was for my shampoo .... he said he needed it worse than I. Sue , a faint smile on her face , goes and gets another egg . Ruby has been looking out of the window . &nbsp; RUBY ( looking out of the window ) I see the sun is still shining . ( she turns around and as Sue hands her the egg ) You know what I was just thinkin ' ? ... I was thinkin ' what a sap I was for stayin ' as a hash-slinger ... Every time I see some dame in one o ' those big limousines  --  with silk stockings and fur coats  --  I get sick . I could get some o ' them things too . I always say to myself .... All you have to be is smart .... You know how they get all them luxuries , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bein ' Secretaries , that 's what ! Secretaries to rich men ! ... I bet I 've seen a million movies when it happened . .... Pitzie Hartz  --  the guy I used to go with  --  was always sayin ' to me , " Ruby , why do n't you do somethin ' like that , instead of dishing up grub all the time ? You 're too good to be a hash-slinger , " he used to tell me . He used to say I was the berries . Sure , it was baloney ,  --  but I used to get all hot and bothered when he said it ... Now I 've sorta come to think he 's right ... ( pauses , then continues half-apologetically ) O' course , I ai n't as good looking as some of these girls ... but it ai n't that that  --  71  --  gets men always ... It 's personality . Sue is compelled to smile .... &nbsp; RUBYSo tomorrow I 'm going to start learning how to run one of those typewriter machines ... I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge to teach you how ... Plenty of girls ... &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( looking up from his newspaper ) ( harshly ) Say ! .. Will you over shut up ! &nbsp; RUBY ( tartly ) ( gives him an annoyed look and continues ) As I was saying , maybe my legs ai n't the last word in mahogany , but as Pitzie Hartz used to say , plenty of girls no better'n me .... Ruby turning toward fire-escape . FADE OUT FADE IN pp. 21-41 &nbsp; pp. 72-91B 89 : EXT . NOLAN TENEMENT BUILDING EARLY MORNING Marie stands in the doorway , across the street . She is clearly waiting for something , and is extremely nervous . After a moment of fixed eyeing of the Nolan entrance , she crosses the street and enters . CUT TO : 89A : RUBY 'S FLAT She is in bed , but awake . Reaching over to her portable phongraph she starts a record ( the familiar tune ) playing , then she rolls over comfortably . CUT TO : 89B : THE NOLAN FLAT Sue has just finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk bottle and sets it out in the hall . As she returns Matt emerges from the bedroom , dressed in dungarees or overalls . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( indicating upstairs with his eyes ) Someday I 'm gon na commit Harey Carey with that dame and her one record ! Sue shrugs , then she observes his dress . &nbsp; SUE RILEYAre n't you goin ' to the stone cutters ' with Father Nulty ? &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( disagreeably , going toward the door ) It 's only 9 o'clock . I 'm going to go over to the garage with the back ... I got clutch trouble . He goes out with no further word . CUT TO :  --  73  --  90 : HALLWAY Marie is approaching slowly up the hall when Matt comes out of his flat . She ducks into an alcove quickly . We have a moment of suspense as he stops but a few feet from her to light a cigarette  --  he passes on . CUT TO : 91 : INT . NOLAN FLAT Sue is in the bedroom making the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocks are heard at the door . Puzzled , she crosses the room and opens the door , disclosing Marie . &nbsp; MARIE ( deeply agitated ) Sue  --  Can I talk to you a moment ? &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( coldly ) What do you mean coming here ? &nbsp; MARIEIt 's terribly important , honey . I 've got to see you . &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( opening the door wider ) Make it snappy ... What if Matt catches you here ? &nbsp; MARIE ( entering and closing door ) I 've been waiting since six o'clock  --  I had to come ! ( swiftly ) The cops are hot on Buck and I 've got to do something quick . I 've got to get him out of the country ... He was hiding out in Jersey until Monday ... but the landlady got suspicious so we had to move him back here .... &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( cutting in ) Why are you telling me all this ?  --  74  --  &nbsp; MARIEI 'll get to that in a minute ... Joe Silva knows a purser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's fixing it so Buck can get smuggled on tomorrow night ... Sue frowns and moves as if to interrupt her , but Marie continues , even more rapidly : This purser guy wants a hundred dollars and we have n't got a cent .... &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( interrupting ) ( frigidly ) What has that to do with me ? .. I 'm not interested in what happens to Buck Gerard . &nbsp; MARIE ( pleadingly ) You ... you have to help me ... You 've got to give me the money ! &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( stiffly ) Me ? ... I have n't any money ... and ... ( emphatically ) I have no intention of helping the man who killed my husband 's brother , ( reaches for doorknob ) ( haughtily ) Please go ... if Matt finds you here .... &nbsp; MARIE ( clutching her arm ) ( excitedly ) I know Buck 's no good ! ... I know you hate him ! ... but ca n't you see that you 're the only one I can come to ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to Buck ? ... He 'd kill him ! ... Your husband  --  he 'd be a murderer ! ... And he 'd go to the can just like your Dad did ! There is a sound of footsteps in the hallway . CUT TO : 92 : STAIR OF NOLAN FLAT Matt is running up the steps . CUT TO :  --  75  --  93 : INT . NOLAN FLAT &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( suddenly panicky ) Maybe that 's Matt now .... Galvanized into action , she looks around the room , sees fire-escape . &nbsp; SUE RILEYHere , go on up a few steps ... hide there . Marie complies . As she climbs out , Matt comes in , a cigarette in his hand . &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( trying to cover her confusion as she follows him into the bedroom ) What 's the matter , honey ? &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( commencing to change his clothes ) There is too much work on the car to do it this morning ... everything 's wrong with it ... clutch ... starter ... ignition ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do the job right . Sue continues making the bed . &nbsp; SUE RILEYThat 's too bad , dear . You going over to the stone cutters ' now ? &nbsp; MATT NOLANYeah ... it 's a little earlier than Father Nulty said ... but maybe he 'll be ready when I get there . There is a long pause then Matt begins in a warmer tone . &nbsp; MATT NOLANYou know I was just thinkin ' that I ai n't been very nice to you ... considerin ' we just got married ... ( by this time he has changed into his driver 's uniform ; he takes her by the shoulders and turns her around ) ( contritely ) I 'm sorry , honey .  --  76  --  &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( gently ) I know what 's been bothering you , Matt . All you can think about is getting even  --  but , dear , why ca n't you let the police take care of that ? CUT TO : 94 : FIRE ESCAPE LANDING Marie re-acts sharply to this , her eyes dilating wildly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( dropping his arms , his manner chilling somewhat ) You 're a woman , Sue  --  you do n't understand how a man feels about a thing like this . Matt walks over to the fire-escape window and flips out his cigarette , just past Marie 's feet . &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( softly ) Maybe so , Matt ... but why ca n't we forget all this and start life over again out there in Illinois like a couple of human beings ? &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( smiling ) You still talking about those cows and chickens , eh ? ( she nods simply ) Well , we 'll talk about that later . ( he pats her cheek ) I 'll run along and pick up Father Nulty. ( he gets halfway to the door , then turns ) Say , why do n't you go along with me and help pick out the stone ?  --  77  --  &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( stammering ) Why ... I ... I ... I 'd like to , Matt ... but ... but ... I 've got a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( turning again to go ) All right ... I 'll see you later . He exits . A moment later Marie comes down from the fire escape and into the room . &nbsp; MARIE ( her excitement unabated ) Sue ... see what I mean ? ... I heard what he said ! ... He 'll never rest till he gets his hands on Buck ! ( wildly ) He 'll kill him ! ... He 'll kill him , I tell you ! ( her voice drops to an anguished pitch ) Then ca n't you see you 'd be in the same spot I am now ? ... He 'd be a murderer ! ... just like my man is ! &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( despairingly ) Yes ... I know ... &nbsp; MARIE ( clutching Sue wildly ) Then please help me ! ... Please help me get him away ... I know he 's rotten and mean ... but he 's mine , honey ! .... he 's mine just like Matt is yours ! ... and I love him too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! .... You 're not doing it for me ... you 're doing it for Matt , for your man ! Please ! Sue is moved . Suddenly she comes to a decision . Breaking away from Marie she goes to the pantry , takes down the Quaker Oats box and empties its contents upon the table . She counts out a hundred dollars , leaving but a few bills and the silver and hands it to Marie . &nbsp; SUE RILEYHere ... Take it . Marie takes the money and puts it in her bosom , then seizes Sue 's hand and covers it with passionate kisses .  --  78  --  &nbsp; MARIE ( weeping and incoherent ) I 'll never forget this .... honey .... Sue puts her arm around her and leads her to the door . &nbsp; MARIE ( wiping her eyes ) I 'll send it back to you as soon as we 're set . &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( unhappy ) I should n't have done it ... I should n't have taken Matt 's money ... but ... ( with a wry smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point there is a knock at the door and it opens before either girl can move . Skeet intrudes his head . &nbsp; SKEETMatt ! ( sees Sue ) Is Matt in ? &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( embarrassed ) Why .... why ... no ... he left a half hour ago ... Skeet sees Marie , gapes at her , then after regaining his composure ... turns to Sue again . &nbsp; SKEETWhere 'd he go ! ? I got something very important to tell him . The Consolidated has offered us both a swell job ! &nbsp; SUE RILEYWhy ... why ... he ... wont over to the garage . &nbsp; SKEET ( backing out , after one more gape at Marie ) All right ... I 'll see him later . He exits . &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( turns on Marie ) He 'll tell Matt he saw you here . He recognized you right away ... you 'd better go .  --  79  --  &nbsp; MARIEMaybe he did n't know me . Sue shrugs , then opens the door . &nbsp; MARIE ( with deep feeling ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sue walks slowly across the room , presses her temples with her palms and running her fingers through her hair . CUT TO : 96 : STONE CUTTERS A large wooden sign , set up on posts , is prominently in the f.g . It reads . " MURPHY AND LOMBARDI " " Monuments of Character " The lot is sprinkled profusely with an assortment of monuments , ranging from huge granite shafts to simple tablets . In the rear is a small building , marked " Office " , and next to it is an open face shack , used as the workroom of the stone cutters . One of them is working on a marble mausoleum in the b.g . Father Nulty , Matt and Lombardi are standing in the center of the lot . Lombardi is pointing to a small conservative headstone , adorned with two white doves ; &nbsp; LOMBARDIYou can not do better anywhere for that price ... a hundred dollars is cheap . ( he winks significantly ) Lombardi knows . &nbsp; MATT NOLANAll right ... go ahead ... you have the  --  effitaph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call it ? &nbsp; NULTY ( gravely ) The inscription . &nbsp; LOMBARDIThank you , Mr. Noolan ...

I did n't like to ask you ... but you understand ... &nbsp; MATT NOLANSure ... that 's all right . I want you to engrave it right today . Father Nulty , who has been reading the inscription on several nearby stones comes up smiling . &nbsp; FATHER NULTYEverything settled ? Matt and Lombardi nod and the three pick their way toward the sidewalk . &nbsp; LOMBARDII do a nice job ... You no have to worry . ( bows ) Thank you very much ... Goodbye , Mr. Noolan ... Goodbye , Father . He tips his hat and commences walking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab , which is parked at the curb . &nbsp; FATHER NULTYThere 's no use of your taking me back , Matt ... I have some sick calls to make right in this neighborhood . &nbsp; MATT NOLANI 'll be glad to wait for you , Father . &nbsp; FATHER NULTYNo ... no , thank you ... You run along to your business and I 'll see you and Sue later . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( tipping his hat ) Goodbye , Father . Father Nulty walks down the street and Matt climbs into his cab . He steps on the starter , but it fails to work . After one or two tries , he gets out a crank , walks around in front and commences turning over the motor with it . As he is doing so , Skeet drives up , honking his horn . He jumps out and runs up to Matt.  --  81  --  &nbsp; SKEET ( out of breath ) I 've been looking all over for you ... first I goes to the house and then Sue tells me you are at the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The garage ? ...

Tell ' em it 's too far away from Xmas . ( hands Skeet the crank ) Here  --  turn her over for me , will ya ? The starter 's stuck . Skeet is crestfallen . Matt climbs into the cab and Skeet labors over the crank , then leans on the door . &nbsp; SKEETYou know ... A funny thing happened just now ... When I goes up to your house ... to tell you about the proposition ... who do you think I saw there with Sue ? &nbsp; MATT NOLANWho ? &nbsp; SKEETMarie ... Buck 's girl ! &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( frowning ) Marie in my house ? ... How long ago ? &nbsp; SKEETJust a few minutes ago ... you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage and over here ?  --  82  --  &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( grimly ) That 's funny ....

You knew it was for Danny 's headstone , did n't you ? &nbsp; SUE RILEYYes ... but Ruby promised to give it back in a day or two . Matt grunts in contempt .

It is Skeet . &nbsp; RUBY ( quickly ) Oh , you 're just in time , Skeet ... come on , you run me up to 33rd Street . &nbsp; SKEETI got to see Matt . He motions to Matt , who joins him in the corner . &nbsp; SKEET ( whispering excitedly ) Slats comes to me just now and tells me Buck is in town . &nbsp; MATT NOLAN ( quickly ) Where ? &nbsp; SKEETHe was hiding out in Jersey , but he come in town the other night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out down on 15th Street .

You 're just like the rest ... what did you do with my hundred bucks ?  --  88  --  Instead of answering , Sue grabs the pistol under the newspaper and levels it at him . &nbsp; SUE RILEY ( her voice trembling ) I 'll tell you ...

She has backed up to the wall leveling the revolver at him tensely . Matt laughs derisively . &nbsp; MATT NOLANGo on shoot ! ... if you can ... it is n't loaded ! Her arm relaxes helplessly .
