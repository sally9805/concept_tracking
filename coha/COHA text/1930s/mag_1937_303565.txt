Parading smartly about the U. S. these past few weeks has been the elegant figure of M. Lucien Lelong , French War hero and member of that small coterie of Paris couturiers who rule the world of feminine fashion . M. Lelong has been in the U. S. frankly drumming up trade for his dresses and for his new perfume Impromptu which now shares honors with dress shields , bathing caps and fingernail polish in many a corner drugstore . An up &; coming rival of M. Lelong is M. Marcel Rochas in both Paris fashions and perfume . He too is in the U. S. drumming up trade but by different means . His rivals concede that he is doing a daring thing for a Paris dressmaker , for Marcel Rochas last week opened a Manhattan branch , the first such opened by a major French couturier. * <P> U. S. women are wealthier and , according to no less an authority than M. Lelong , better dressed than any others in the world . Therefore they are one of the best markets for Paris dressmakers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entailing a little risk and certainly much courage . Let M. Rochas do it , and then , if he succeeds and is not dmod , certainly others will follow . <P> Sleek , medium-sized Marcel Rochas , a conventional French brunet , is grandson of a Burgundian shepherd and son of an Avignon artist . He was born in Paris in 1902 , and presently set out to be a lawyer . He readily explains how his Gallic temperament led him to become a dressmaker : <P> " I was madly in love with my young and beautiful bride but our means were limited . And so I came swiftly to the conclusion that the best way to meet my budget and still have my wife beautifully dressed was for me to become her couturier . A solution both simple and complicated at the same time . Simple because I was in love ; complicated because I possessed only $5,000 . " <P> M. Rochas now has a pretty blue-and-white salon at 12 Avenue Matignon where he does a thriving business , sketching his designs himself and personally directing fitters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan establishment is identical in style and layout with his Paris shop . An old five-story private house at 32 East 67th Street , with a new , shining , white faade and MARCEL ROCHAS in deep blue over the lintel , it sits in a row of old brownstone apartments , like a blue-eyed blonde on a bench with pickaninnies . Inside is a big desk which no one , however pompous , may pass without presenting an invitation ( issued this week only to socialites and nouveaux riches ) -a barrier raised partly for swank , partly to keep out style pirates of whom couturiers have a healthy fear , in spite of the fact that to make cheaply a good copy of either the drapery or workmanship of a fine dress is often virtually impossible . <P> In Paris , Rochas sells models both to individuals , retail , and to stores , " wholesale " for copying . In Manhattan he will sell retail only , at prices from $300 up , higher than any other U. S. dressmaker . All dresses will be made on order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week includes about 100 dresses and will not be shown to Rochas ' private customers in Paris until October . Rochas ' clothes , generally simple and neat , often have vigorous color combinations . Rochas makes no hats , but does produce three brands of perfume : Audace , Ave . Matignon and Air Jeune.
