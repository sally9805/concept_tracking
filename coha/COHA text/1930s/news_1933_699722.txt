txt Plea for Pedestrians . To the Editor of The New York Times : What is one to do when in crossing a street the lights change when one has reached the middle of the street ? The automobilists promptly start on their way without regard for the poor pedestrian , who must of necessity remain marooned . Then , if a car skids or the driver is not particularly careful , the pedestrian is in danger of being hit . Also , the pedestrian is liable to injury from a car coming around a corner , although again the lights are in favor of the walker . For a short time , a year or more ago , there was in effect a traffic rule requiring automobilists to keep their cars standing when lights changed until pedestrians who had left the curb had an opportunity to gain the other side . Why ca n't this regulation be again put in operation ? B. KIRCHER . New York , May 3 , 1933.                @ @ @ @ @
