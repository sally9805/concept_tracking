Down the gangway of S. S. Paris as she docked in Manhattan one day last week cautiously stepped a small dark man whose face wore the faintly perplexed expression of a foreigner . As he has done each year for the last 19 , Laurence Hills was returning to his native New York City to report on the condition of the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune , of which he is editor and general manager . Three facts made this trip different from its predecessors : 1 ) Laurence Hills was sick , 2 ) Europe was sick , 3 ) his paper was not too well . <P> Probably the most storied newspaper of its size in the world , the Paris Herald , as most Americans call it ( Parisians call it Le New York ) , has lived through three distinct careers , under three publishers . Each career has reflected the condition and aspirations of its readers-the Americans who live in Europe . Founded in 1887 by the late great James Gordon Bennett , it was for three decades a society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write . It carried whole pages of yachting news , maintained its own coach to Versailles , was written in two languages , with the somewhat quaint idea that people who spoke both French and English liked to read their news the same way . <P> Laurence Hills was Washington correspondent for the New York Sun in 1920 when Frank Andrew Munsey bought the New York Herald and with it the Paris edition . Hills asked Munsey to let him run the Paris Herald and got , with the job , Munsey 's blunt opinion that " there is no need of a first-class newspaperman on the Herald . " Laurence Hills , then 40 , remade the paper nevertheless . He threw out the French departments , put in United Press service , used airplanes to get his paper to London and Amsterdam , upped daily stock quotations from five or six to 600 . Hills wanted to make the Herald an international paper , and did , but at the same time it remained a small-town sheet , written by small-town newspapermen for the army of small-town Americans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1920s was a newspaperman 's alcoholic dream . The pay was not much ( $40 a week was top ) and the turnover was fast , but the work was easy and two big staffs ( afternoon and night ) of rewrite and copydesk men could spend half their time in the bistro on the corner or playing cards on the copy desk . The Herald was published in an old building in the Rue du Louvre , adequately covered by insurance , and it was considered all right to light fires in the wastebaskets and put them out with imitation champagne . Only permanent fixtures on the staff were Managing Editor Eric Hawkins ( who , being an Englishman with a French wife , was adept at suppressing what the French would n't like and correcting the more objectionable misspellings of the native composing room crew ) ; Sportswriter " Sparrow " Robertson ( who sent his copy over from Harry 's New York Bar ) , and Laurence Hills himself ( who was a little aghast at it all , except when he added up the profits ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid 5 to read its cabled news from New York , its " Letters From the Mailbag " ( occasionally staff-written ) , its classified ads for apartments and friendships , its homey items from Sioux City and Dallas .
