Overshadowing every other event in the Far East this week was the abrupt appointment of Japan 's arch-Fascist and patrioteer Yosuke Matsuoka as President of Japan 's most potent engine of economic expansion into China , the South Manchuria Railway . This appointment ousted S. M. R. 's comparatively mild and cautious president , Count Hirotaro Hayashi , who balked schemes of Japanese jingoes to establish a Development Company for North China in which S. M. R. would hold a controlling interest . Such a company was to exploit North China , as the British East India Company exploited India a century ago . <P> New President Matsuoka , brilliant , ruth less , resourceful , has been called " the most Westernized of Japanese leaders and the most dangerous to the West . " It was he who haughtily led Japan 's delegation out of the League of Nations when Geneva tried to curb his country 's invasion of Manchuria ( TIME , March 6 , 1933 ) . <P> Brought up in the U. S. by a hardy Oregon woman , Yosuke Matsuoka was toughened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Coast , returned to Japan to become secretary to the great empire-builder , Field Marshal Prince Yamagata . Matsuoka 's appointment as President of S. M. R. means that Japan 's most determined militarists again dominate the Government . Smart , they put up a great smoke screen of announcements last month that War Minister General Senjuro Hayashi was appointing " milder men " to key posts . <P> In Japan proper the object of Fascist Matsuoka and his clique is to crush all political parties and usher in a " Showa Restoration " of imperialistic militarism sanctified by fanatical devotion to the Emperor as Son of Heaven ( see below ) . Said the new President of S. M. R. , who is expected to establish as soon as possible a Development Company for North China : " I have assumed the Presidency of the South Manchuria Railway with the firm determination to become active on the Asiatic mainland . Japan is going to start operations in North China . The arrow has left the bow ! Most Japanese do not yet understand the great importance of these operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really serious national crisis . The progress of these operations will decide the destiny of the Japanese race and its rise or fall in the World . To carry through these operations a domestic renovation is inevitable which is why I am a champion of Showa. "
