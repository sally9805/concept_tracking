" L'AFFAIRE JONES " A STORY BY HILLEL BERNSTF , IN June 19 F OR three days I have been a political prisoner in the Sante Prison . All Paris is in uproar . The newspapers denounce me . The Chamber of Deputies is full of speeches . Outside the prison a mob howls for my bead . I can not hear them howl , but the guard delightedly assures me that it is so . I am a grand eriminel and an enemy of France . I am a spy , an agitator , a conspirator against the safety of France , and what not . I have heard so many things about myself in the past three days that I am becoming almost too weak to protest . But in spite of everything I cling tenaciously to two facts : that I am Henry Jones , from Windfall , Georgia ; and that I came to France to write a cook hook . Nothing more than that . A. cook book extolling the glories of the foods and wines of France , and deriding the gastronomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed down my special recipe for cornpone-and-potlikker . And yet I am a prisoner and a national issue- " Calle/ire Jones " ? and the Government may even fall . How do I account for it All I am able to grasp is that whatever one does in France  --  be it art , study , filet mignon , or love  --  one stumbles very soon into the debt question and the battle of Verdun . When a French person and an American in Paris get into an argument about a padded bill , a burned steak , or even Picasso , it is only a matter of seconds before the French person will bring up the debt question and " we who were at Verdun , " et cetera . Two such instances and two such French persons  --  a patriotic housewife and the proprietor of a restaurant ? conspired to bring about my downfall . Three days ago the woman  --  she is a Mme. Gauthier , I learned later  --  swept like a tornado into my room in the Rue du Val-de-Grace , where I was enthusiastically noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare of Georgia . I had never seen her before ; she was a complete stranger , and yet she accused me of having taken her husband 's new coat in a restaurant that day and of leaving him my old coat . In the pocket of that old coat , mysteriously enough , was a slip of paper bearing my name and address , and  --  stranger still  --  in my handwriting . I did not know what to make of it but argued that it was more likely that the man who left the coat was someone other than myself , someone for whom I had written my name and address , although my memory failed to identify the person . But no explanation satisfied . She searched my wardrobe ; she cross-examined me ; she made references to the police . Bewildered , I still pleaded innocence , and then she became very furious and patriotic ; she mentioned Verdun ; she demanded that I go with her to the restaurant , to be identified by the proprietor . If it had been any other establishment than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed with alacrity , the quicker to get rid of her . But it so happened that I had once been an habitu ? of that restaurant . There had finally been a scene between the proprietor and myself over an underdone rognon and a bottle of alleged Saint-Emilion that was only vin ordinaire . That was five months ago , and the restaurant saw me no more . Now I dreaded meeting that man again , but I had to prove my innocence ; it should have been a simple matter to establish that I was not in the restaurant that noon , or any other noon in recent months . On the street en route to the restaurant my accuser resumed the argument about the coat . We had progressed no more than a block when the usual patriotic interlude occurred : la France ; Verdun ; the debt . 1 said , " Madame , this matter of the coat may be very important , but I can not see where it involves la France . It is not an international issue , it is purely local . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France for one little moment ? " " No , " she cried , halting and throwing her right arm upward . " I will never forget la France . Vive la France ! Vive la patrie ! " As with any controversy on the streets of Paris , it brought a crowd . Noting that it was a controversy between a Frenchwoman and a foreigner , an American , the curious who flocked around us took up the national cry like a football cheering section , shouting " Vive la France ! A bas les strangers ! " That was not so good . The crowd increased in size and vocal volume with each step , it accompanied us all the way , with patriotic lungs extending themselves to serve as an adequate chorus for our procession . I became too concerned to laugh ; I could not even venture a smile . When the proprietor of the restaurant saw me , his eyebrows lifted , and he smiled . Approaching , I pleaded with him to forget our past controversy over his wretched cuisine and still more wretched wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been there for luncheon that day . He replied , " You are an enemy of /a cuisine frangaise . " " Not of la good cuisine frangaise , " I insisted . " Am 1 not writing a cook book about la good cuisine frangaise ? " " Only to insult it , without doubt , " he said . " La France , which saved you at Verdun , and for which service , instead of being grateful , you demand that we pay the debt ? " " Monsieur , please , " I pleaded . " It is not a question of la France . It is a question of a missing coat and of a luncheon . If I did not have the luncheon , I could not have taken the coat . Wo n't you please confine yourself to that ? " " And I insist that it is a question of la France , " said the proprietor in a ringing voice , as he looked about for moral support from his audience , which was augmenting every minute . " We others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Monsieur , " I broke in , desperately , " please do n't tell me about Verdun . Please try to forget la France and Verdun for one moment , and tell Madame whether I was here for luncheon to-day . " The restaurateur became majestic , there was fire in his eye . " Forget la France ? Forget Verdun ? Never ? Vice la France ! " " Niue hr France ! " cried Mme. Gauthier . " Vine la France ! " went up a roar from sixty or seventy throats . The police came . They were greeted by cries of " An enemy of France ! A spy ! An insulter of France ! Down with the foreigners ! To prison ! The debt ! The debt ! " The police asked me for my " papers . " I had neglected to obtain an official identity card , which neglect was a State offense , and so , whether I was wrong or right in my quarrel , there was a valid reason for my arrest . I was marched off to jail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kaleidoscopic hours , during which I was hustled from place to place , whirled all over Paris , examined by official after official ; so rapidly did one thing succeed another that it is mostly a blur now . My inquisitors , apparently , had decided that there was an organized underground conspiracy against France . They were looking for spies , and in spite of my heated denials to the thousand or more questions they put to me , in spite of my insistence that it was a mistake about a coat , they convinced themselves that I was a spy , and an important one too . What a night I spent ! I sat on my " bed , " my head in my hands , trying to piece together the occurrences of the day , wondering whether this could all be real  --  coat , luncheon , slip of paper , mob , enemy of France , spy , official questioning , prison . And all through the night I was tormented by that bit of paper . I had written my name and address for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the morning . With glee the guard brought me the newspapers . All over the front pages there was smeared the story of a sensational capture . A notorious spy and conspirator against France had been arrested . He was the spearhead of agreat thrust against the security of the Republic . His ramifications had spread everywhere . He had been active in Syria in the rebellion of the Druse tribes against the French authority . He had been in the Damascus affair . His hand was recognized in some trouble in French Indo-China . He was the man who had been behind Abd-El Krim in the Riff chieftain 's war against France . He was high in favor in Moscow and Berlin . He was known to have conferred with Fascist chiefs in Rome . Wherever and whenever France had been imperilled there were traces of the work of this man Jones . All this he was able to do under the cover of his American nationality ! So audacious had he become that he was operating openly in Paris . A loyal Frenchwoman who had only expressed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not content with that , he had even gone so far as to attempt an anti-French demonstration in the capital of France ! Certain queer writings found in his quarters , obviously in code , were being deciphered at the Quai d'Orsay . These writings dealt with every part of France , and the names of foods and wines were cleverly adopted as covering words for fortifications and garrisons . The Government was congratulated in some newspapers for having tracked this menace to earth . The Government was denounced in others for having permitted this condition to exist . The Government should resign . The Government should not resign . At first I thought of communicating with the American Embassy , but I feared that if I did so the Embassy would get in touch with my people in Windfall , and I squirmed when I thought how they would enjoy my discomfiture . Then something better occurred to me . There were three Americans in Paris whom I knew , and who were supposed to have a great deal of influence with French officials . Known as Brands arms de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legion of Honor in the next lists . Why not appeal to them ? So I wrote letters to Harrison Jaxey Irvine , J. Walter Wilberforce , and Noel S. Wilkinson , and gave them unsealed to the prison authorities to mail . In my letters I stated my case fully and eloquently and pleaded for their immediate aid . It was merely , I felt , a matter of waiting a few hours , until they had received my letters , and then I should be freed in short order . Hour after hour passed without any word from Irvine , Wilberforce , and Wilkinson . I wondered whether they had received the letters . I wondered about the mysterious bit of paper in my handwriting . Then the guards took me to a large room , where three men from the Quai d'Orsay questioned me for an hour . I insisted upon my innocence . I explained that I had not taken Mme. Gauthier 's husband 's coat , that I did not know how my name and address happened to be in the pocket of the substituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquisitors . " What has a coat to do with this ? " " Everything , " I said . " It is because of a coat that I did not take -- - " " This is no matter of a coat , " he replied , loftily . " It is a matter of the safety of the French Republic . " June V Much to my disappointment , the prison gates have not opened for my exit . There has been no word of any kind from Irvine , Wilberforce , or Wilkinson . I do not understand it . And all the while the volume of accusation increases . The newspapers amuse France with more revelations of my secret activities . In addition , I have again been subjected to officialquestioning , but I continue to deny everything . The situation is more bewildering than ever . This morning there were three separate demonstrations outside the prison . I saw them from a window in a corridor . My two guards had been taking me for a twenty-minute exercise along the corridor , when one of them suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what I had done . From the window I saw three hundred Royalists march past , armed with heavy sticks . They shouted , " Long live the King ! Long live Daudet ! Down with the Government ! " Several minutes later three hundred Communist marchers came into sight , carrying even stouter clubs than the Royalists . They shouted , " Long live the Soviets ! Long live Stalin ! Down with the Government ! " Before I had time to puzzle it out , another small army marched past . These were shouting , " Long live the Socialists ! Long live the levy on capital ! " " Do you see what you have done ? " said the guard , smiling . I did this ? I , Henry Jones , of Windfall , Georgia , who only wanted to write a cook hook ? " Tell me one thing , " I asked the guard . " Why are the Communists here ? " " Evidently they are here because the Royalists are demonstrating . " " And why are the Royalists demon-strating ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And the Socialists ? " " Why not ? " It is very strange . Because a coat is unaccountably missing , I am in prison , the Royalists want a Bourbon King , the Communists want a Soviet , and the Socialists want a capital levy . Things were not like this in Windfall . The guard is very nice . He has six children . When I complimented him on the number , he took it very graciously . He said , simply , " It is for France . " The guard also was at Verdun . June 2.2 To-day there was frightful news . The Communist and the Royalist demonstrations clashed . The police tried to stop it . Thirty Royalists went to the hospital . Thirty-five Communists have broken heads . Fifty policemen were injured . The guard was very pleased . " Do you see what you have done ? " he said . He brought me a much larger ration of beans . I could not eat . The newspapers called it " La Aurae Sangtante . " There were interpellations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputies . Two things trouble me more than anything else . Why has there been no word from Irvine , Wilberforce , and Wilkinson ? And what is the secret behind that mysterious bit of paper with my name and address ? June ZS About eleven o'clock this morning there was a visitor . It was Prester ! Now it all came back to me , in one flash from the past . It was Prester for whom I had written my name and address . I recalled a day when I had run into Prester at the Restaurant des Trois Freres ; he still ate there regularly , the fool . He had asked me where I was living , and I had written it out for him . And in his pocket the address had obviously remained . I said quickly , " Were you at the Restaurant des Trois Freres on Thursday ? " " Yes , and do n't I know it , " he replied . " I was a little bit lit , and I picked up the wrong coat . I 've been asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't figure out till yesterdaywhere I got it . When I returned it I heard this wild yarn about an address in the pocket and an American in jail . Had n't seen the papers . Say , you 're famous . " " How did you get in here ? " I asked . " 1 know somebody 's wife , " he said . I pleaded with him to help me get out , and he promised . I told him about my letters to Irvine , Wilberforce , and Wilkinson , but he laughed scornfully . " I know those ribbon chasers , " he said . " Just a trio of professional growls amis de la France . " He snorted . " Think they 'd help you ? They 're over here to get the Legion of Honor by hook or crook , so they can go back to America and improve their social standing in their home towns . Those boys spend a lot of dough wining and dining French officials ; they contribute to all kinds of funny French causes ; they spread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think they 'd throw away their campaign for the ribbon by helping a guy who 's called a spy and an enemy of France ? Help you ? Why , when you get out  --  if you ever do get out  --  they wo n't even speak to you . " He waxed very bitter . " There 're plenty of Americans who 've done real things for France , and if they want to accept the Legion of Honor , it 's all right with me . But those three birds ! What did they ever do ? Does n't it get you when you think that Napoleon started that Legion of Honor business as a reward for heroes ? " He continued in this strain , and then said , " Well , I 'm off , and I 'll see what I can do . " About fifteen minutes later an extraordinary thing happened . The guard brought to my cell  --  Mme. Gauthier ! Mme. Gauthier , who had caused me all this trouble with her miserable " coat of my husband . " There she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought that she had come to gloat , but it was not so . " Oh , Monsieur Jones , how sorry I am , " she said . " It was all a mistake . A terrible mistake . It was not you who took the coat . It was another , and he has returned it . " " What then ? " I said , bitterly . " I have caused you so much trouble . Oh , how I have reproached myself . I was so excited , I said things that were wrong , that should not have been said . I wish to apologize . Oh , you must believe me . I have suffered . I wish to do what I can to make reparation . I went to the director of the prison and I told him the truth as I now know it . But he said , oh so stupidly , ' Madame , it is not a question of a coat , it is a question of In France . " " And in spite of that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We French are great lovers of la justice . When we find that a wrong has been committed , we will fight to the end for la justice . Read our history . You have much leisure now , so perhaps I will bring you books of French history to read . " " But , madame , have you not heard that I am accused of being a spy , that I am an agent of Moscow and Berlin and Rome , that I incited the Druse uprising in Syria , that in 1925 in London I was overheard advising people not to go to the Exposition of Decorative Arts in Paris , as it was not very interesting ? " " You did not take the coat of my husband , " said Mme. Gauthier firmly . " Have you not heard them say that 1 was with Abd-El Krim in the Riff , that I provoked a mutiny at Oran , that I disapprove of the tenors at the Paris Opera ? " " You did not take the coat of my husband , " said Mme. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your hand , madame , " I said . June 24 To my cell there was admitted today a lawyer , Mattre Chollet of the Paris Bar . He is fat , bustling , red-bearded , and cheerful , although what there is to be cheerful about I can not see . " I am organizing la justice , " said Maitre Chollet . " Never fear , we shall have you out very soon . I have many friends in the right places , I have much influence . We go to work immediately . " He smiles too much , as if it were all a joke . My confidence in him is not very great . Getting me out is serious business , and should it not be approached seriously ? June 25 I have seen the firstfruits of Maitre Chollet 's work . There were leading items to-day in two newspapers in which a little doubt was expressed , for the first time . These journals wondered whether I could really be such an enemy of France as I have been pictured . Could I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places ? Could I have been bright enough to be so effective against the security of France ? After all , I am an American , and Americans , as all Frenchmen know , are notoriously stupid . Late in the day Maitre Chollet came to see me . " The truth is on the march , " he said , rubbing his hands with satisfaction . June 26 " La justice " grows . Eight newspapers now agree that no American could have been bright enough to operate so successfully against la France . Twenty-four newspapers still hold to the original accusations . There are signs of acrimony among the opposing editors . Prester seems to have joined the indifferent company of Wilberforce , Irvine , and Wilkinson ; I hear no more from him than from them . But Maitre Chollet bounces in and out . I must confess that this cheerful lawyer is very irritating , especially when he speaks gloatingly of how my innocence is becoming more and more recognized . If that is his idea of innocence , 1 do n't like it . June 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was arrested as a spy , all France arose as one to protect the nation . Now that I have defenders , the French are fighting among themselves . People are either pro-Jones or anti-Jones . Newspaper editors assail one another 's character . Apropos of l'affaire Jones one editor has accused another of not having been at Verdun . Apropos of the same cast ! , a ten-year feud between a famous playwright and a. critic , due originally to an unfavorable criticism of the playwright 's play , has broken out anew . The count is now fourteen newspapers for Jones , and eighteen against . My defenders bring forth new and devastating proofs of my stupidity . My accusers insist that I am as clever as Machiavelli , devilishly subtle , able to play upon the weaknesses of humanity , able to corrupt angels . My accusers , who give me credit for possessing brains , please me more than my defenders , who insist that I have none . Not one newspaper , by the way , has mentioned the coat . A note has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bar . He writes , " Do n't give up hope . I am on your side . " When Maitre Chollet breezed in , I almost had a row with him . I said that " la justice " was going too far . He merely repeated that the truth was on the march . I said that it had better " about face " and march back . Ifhis campaign kept up , I should probably be released as a complete idiot . I preferred prison . June 28 That miserable Chollet and his " la justice " ! All the pro-Jones newspapers  --  there are sixteen of them now ? came out in general agreement today that I am a dolt . When Maitre Chollet arrived in my cell , strutting in his self-satisfaction , I flew at him . I would have done something awful to him , but the guards separated us . He denounced me as an ingrate . He said the campaign to liberate me would go on . There were two duels this morning over l'affaire Jones . The anti-Jones playwright and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-Jones editor and the anti-Jones editor who had accused him of not having been at Verdun . Nobody was hurt . The editors shook hands and agreed that they had both been at Verdun , but they had just not seen each other . The playwright and critic refused to shake hands , the critic still insisting it was a bad play . I said to the guard that I thought duelling was illegal in France . " And prohibition in America ? " he retorted . Another note has come from Prester , from still another bar . He writes , " Courage ! We , who are about to drink , salute you ! " June 29 I am very unhappy . All seems to be lost . L'affaire Jones is hotter than ever , and in the turmoil I am forgotten , even if this strife is supposedly about me . Maitre Chollet made no call today . There were two more duels in the suburbs , as well as demonstrations and counter-demonstrations in the streets of Paris . To cap it all , a fist fight enlivened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters to the Minister of Foreign Affairs , the Minister of the Interior , and the Minister of Justice . I stated that I did not approve of the campaign for my liberation . I insisted that I was not an idiot . I demanded to be heard in my own behalf . June 30 At two o'clock this afternoon four soldiers in full trench equipment took me from my cell and escorted me to one of the Ministry buildings . I was brought before one whose face 1 recognized instantly , so often had I seen his photograph in the newspapers . I knew I was facing a great Minister of the French Republic , and I was very nervous . On the table before him was a huge pile of papers , about six inches high , and I felt this must be the official dossier of my case . " What have you to say for yourself ? " he said . I began telling him about the unfortunate episode of the coat , and he looked puzzled . " Coat ? Coat ? There is nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ? " I tried again to tell him the whole story . but he appeared unconvinced . I told him that the sole purpose of my stay in France was to write a cook book about the foods and wines of France , to proclaim before my countrymen the superiority of these great products of France . He looked skeptically at me , and said , " Why should you want to do this ? " Launched on my defense , I felt that I was talking for my life and must leave nothing unsaid that might save me . I told him that there was a cabal against me in my native town , that this cabal had cast doubts upon my ability to prepare a great dish , and that the shame of it had driven me from my native land , to seek consolation in the culinary products of anotherland . The great man seemed bored , and I felt that my cause was lost . He yawned , and said listlessly , " You are from Chicago ? " " No , monsieur , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My home is Windfall , in the State of Georgia . " " Georgia ? " His expression changed , and he looked interested . " You are from Georgia ? " " Yes , monsieur . Georgia . It is in the South . " " I know very well where it is , " he snapped . " I was there for a week twenty years ago . " He fell silent for a moment , then looked up sharply . " If you are from Georgia , perhaps you can tell me something . There is a certain dish , I wonder whether you know about it . It is called cornpoue-and-potlikker . " " But , monsieur , it is the very dish to which I have been referring . My mother 's great recipe , and mine . " He seemed electrified . His mouth opened , he got up , he sat down again . " And you say you can prepare this dish ? " " But magnificently , monsieur , " I said . He arose from his seat , walked the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were standing on guard at the door . " Outside , " he said . They went out . The great man closed the door carefully and returned . He faced me . " You 're certain you 're not lying ? " he said , sternly . " Why should I lie , monsieur ? You can easily establish the truth . " He was silent for a moment , then he almost exploded . " Imbeciles ! " he cried . " Your people at your Embassy are all imbeciles . Thirty men on the Embassy staff , and not one of them knows how to prepare this marvellous dish , the memory of which has remained with me for twenty years . Listen ! I will take you at your word . To-morrow night I am giving a dinner for twenty . Can you prepare this dish ? " " If I can obtain the ingredients , monsieur . " " I will give you four or five commissionaires to go through Paris and seek them . Spare no money or effort . " " Gladly , monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We are going home . " Outside the four soldiers fell into step . The great man waved them away . July 1 There were twenty men at dinner . Leaders of all parties , they rarely spoke to one another in public , except to denounce one another as fripons and incompetent bunglers and betrayers of la France . But these leaders belonged to a club of political gourmets who met once every two weeks and ate , each time under the auspices of a different member of the club . There were two paramount rules . One was that each dinner must serve as the occasion for the introduction of a new dish . The other and equally important rule was that the members must not speak to one another ; they must only eat . This was convenient politically for many reasons , but political convenience was not the chief reason for the rule . The highest authorities among gourmets agree that the art of appreciating good food should not be interfered with by conversation . To that foremost of gastronomic tenets the club was scrupulously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its preparation . Therefore the Minister was not in evening clothes like the rest , but was all in culinary white , with a great chef 's cap on his bead . There were six waiters to do the serving , and there were six men in the vast kitchen besides myself . One of my confreresidentified the guests for me . There were two Royalist leaders , two Communist chiefs , four Radical Socialists , three pure Socialists , five National Republicans , two Radical Republicans , and two National Radical Socialist Republicans . Worried as I was , with my fate dependent upon a dish , I could not help giving a thought to this remarkable demonstration of poise and self-mastery . Here were a score of political enemies , most of whom hated one another ; yet these enemies were able to forget the others ' presence and concentrate whole-heartedly upon the blessings of good food . I was full of admiration . For the first time , I believe , I really glimpsed the greatness of France . Such a nation can not be defeated . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fate would be decided . The silence became oppressive . Perspiration stood out on my forehead . I could feel my heart thumping . Suddenly I heard noises . They sounded like cries , but I could not tell whether of joy or of fury . They sounded like explosions . They sounded almost like the great guns at the second battle of the Marne . I heard someone running . Louder came the footsteps , and the great man burst into the kitchen . His arms were outstretched , his eyes were shining . He rushed to me , and put his arms around me . He implanted the accolade on both my cheeks . July 4 I am free . I am happy . On all sides I am congratulated . The newspapers are very kind . They say that " la justice " has been rendered , that a grave mistake has been righted . I am not a dolt and I am not an enemy of France . " Au contraire , c'est un grand ami de la France . " They emphasize especially that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( There had been so much talk about Verdun that 1 had forgotten to mention the Marne . ) Mattre Chollet also tells me that my arrest and confinement served a great purpose for France . Under cover of the agitation and din caused by l'affairs Jones the Government was able quietly to put through a very necessary economy . July /4 To-day the new lists of awards for the Legion of Honor were published . And near the top of the list of the newly created Chevaliers of the Legion of Honor was this entry : " M. Henry Jones , of Windfall , Georgia , for his services to France . " Nothing for Irvine , Wilberforce , or Wilkinson . Vire la France !
