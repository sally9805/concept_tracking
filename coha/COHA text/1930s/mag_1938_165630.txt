As old as ballparks is the box-office problem of the peeping urchin at the knothole . When radio stretches the knothole to fit its public 's enormous ear , the problem swells to lawsuit size . Pittsburgh Athletic Co. has banned any broadcasting from the Pittsburgh Pirates ' home grounds ( similar bans are in force at the Yankee Stadium , Polo Grounds , Ebbets Field ) . But at the beginning of the baseball season Pittsburgh Athletic Co. sold to General Mills , Inc. , Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. , Inc. , for broadcasting over Stations WWSW and NBC 's KDKA ( Pittsburgh ) , exclusive rights for games played by the Pirates away from home . <P> Much to the annoyance of all parties to this agreement , a third Pittsburgh station , bustling KQV , impudently proceeded to pirate not only the broadcasts of the Pirates ' out-of-town games , but of home games as well . The Pirates ' owners joined NBC and its two sponsors in an appeal to the courts . <P> Although KQV ceased broadcasting out-of-town games early in May , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month to lift its ban and allow to its sponsors the games KQV was pirating . In Federal district court , KQV , still brash , explained that it had rented space in a building overlooking the ball park , argued that it had a perfect right to broadcast what it saw from its own property . Promptly the Pirates raised a canvas screen to shut off KQV 's knothole . To plug the knothole tight , last week Judge F. P. Schoonmaker ruled that the club has a property right in broadcasts of its games , issued a preliminary injunction against KQV 's broadcast peepshow .
