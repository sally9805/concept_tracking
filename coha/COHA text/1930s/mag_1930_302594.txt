" The Christian Century stands alone among the independent opinion-making weeklies . . . of national circulation , as an advocate of Federal prohibition . " <P> Under the heading " A Solemn Responsibility , " leading editorial in last week 's Christian Century , Editor Charles Clayton Morrison made that statement which , he said " has been a fact for a long time but has not been recognized until now . " Occasion for Editor Morrison 's awakening was the announcement of the change of Christian Herald from weekly to monthly schedule beginning next February. * " It is not too much to say that the success or failure of Prohibition may rest with The Christian Century , " he added . <P> Editor Morrison had to bank heavily upon his distinction between an undenominational magazine , as The Christian Century describes itself , and the denominational press . Except for the Wet Catholic journals , most important of which are Commonwealth and America , the denominational press is mainly a Dry bulwark . Prohibition leans hard upon the support of the Methodist Episcopal Christian Advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34,553 ) , and their like . <P> Editor Morrison further said : <P> " We wish that there were journalistic allies by our side . We wish that the Atlantic Monthly , Harpers , Scribners , were with us . We wish that the Nation , the New Republic , the Outlook ( Lyman Abbott must have turned over in his grave when that paper recently became the most liquor-soaked organ in the country ) , the Literary Digest , TIME , the Forum , the World Tomorrow , or any other of the major weeklies were with us . But they are not . One dares to hope that among them one or two converts may yet be made . " * <P> To meet what Editor Morrison described as a deplorable emergency he rallied his readers as follows : " Our readers already constitute the most powerful moral bloc of public opinion in this nation . How better can they exercise their power than by enlarging the bloc itself ? . . . Every teacher in your public school should now be sought out-every professor on your college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing your state at Washington-every colleague on your board-every parishioner in your congregation who can read serious discussion-every lawyer , physician , club woman , thoughtful business man , political leader - these should be sought out and enlisted as readers of The Christian Century . " <P> Obvious was the sincerity of this appeal . No less obvious was the fact that , however intended , it was excellent business for The Christian Century ; that The Christian Century ( present circulation 32,500 ) stood to reap the sort of benefit that befalls munitions makers in wartime . <P> <P> * A canvass of leading non-religious magazines made by TIME ( March 24 ) revealed no avowed supporter of Prohibition save Ladies ' Home Journal . <P> * TIME 's position has been and will remain unbiased on Prohibition and all other public questions. - ED.
