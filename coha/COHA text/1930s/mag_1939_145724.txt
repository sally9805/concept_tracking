Quo Vadimus ? - E.B . White-Harper ( $2 ) . <P> Elwyn Brooks ( " Andy " ) White for eleven years wrote the oxymoronic introductory paragraphs to each New Yorker issue . The tone of these paragraphs , a kind of precocious , off-hand humming , has been imitated but never exactly reproduced by his successors . In 1937 he resigned from The New Yorker , after writing an inimitable farewell whose gamut ranged from a baritone sigh to a neurasthenic squeak . True to his theme ( that the town was getting too much for him ) he went off to live in the Maine countryside , at North Brooklin . Thence he contributes a monthly page ( considerably duller than his New Yorker quiddities ) to Harpers . <P> Last week was published E. B. W. 's second slim collection of little prose pieces-most of them from the files of The New Yorker-which will please the melancholy humor of many a modern Jaques . E. B. W. dips the broken reed with which he writes into various liquids-diluted acid , crocodile tears , the milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like the trail of a sometimes sympathetic , sometimes exasperating , always bewildered insect . <P> Out-loud laughs , as in all up-to-date humor , are few , but E. B. W. sometimes unbends to such old-fashioned jovialities as pointing out the difference between a major and a minor poet : " Any poem starting with ' And when ' is a serious poem written by a major poet . . . . Any poem , on the other hand , ending with ' And how ' comes under the head of light verse , written by a minor poet . " Or his suggestion for a digest to end digests , " which condensed a Hemingway novel to the single word ' Bang ! ' and reduced a long Scribner 's article about the problem of the unruly child to the two words ' Hit him . ' " The most polished baiter of TIMEstyle extant , he includes A Guide to the Pronunciation of Words in TIME . <P> In so serious a book as Quo Vadimus ? , however , such relaxations are few . E. B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humorist , and that he still considers being a humorist no laughing matter .
