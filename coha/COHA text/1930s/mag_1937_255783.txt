Like the sap rising in a forest is the morning flow of Manhattanites to work , as packed elevators in tall buildings whisk them upward by thousands to disperse on higher and higher floors . By the time this life has drained out of the office buildings at 5 p.m. and apartment houses and hotels are full for the night , Manhattan elevators have carried 13,000,000 passengers 95,000 miles . In the business of furnishing vertical transportation to New York and other cities , famed Otis Elevator Co. held an unworried near-monopoly from about 1900 to 1926 , controlled as much as 75% of elevator installation in the U. S. Then Westinghouse Electric 's new elevator division made Otis feel the pinch of competition , now handles about 20% of the business . In Westinghouse engineering Otis met a worthy rival , perhaps for the first time . <P> All elevator engineering is based on the simple hoist . Suspended by cables ( still " ropes " to elevator men ) and balanced by a counterweight , the car is drawn upward on its rails by a motor-driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaft . The development of this mechanism from the old geared , hand-operated elevator to the modern skyscraper type was chiefly a matter of making the necessary high speeds comfortable and safe . Pioneering Otis engineers experimenting on Otis employes found that a speed of 1,200 ft. per minute was fast enough , that the rate of acceleration upward of an elevator can not be greater than 14 ft. per sec. without causing passengers ' knees to buckle as gravity 's pull abruptly increases their weight. * To slow down and stop high speed elevators Otis perfected its " signal control " system , by which contacts made at every floor with the braking mechanism become effective only when a button has been pushed for a certain floor . Of this type are the Otis elevators ( capable of 1,200 ft. per min. ) in the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings . <P> One of the first big Westinghouse coups was the installation of 36 top-speed ( 1,400 ft. per min. ) elevators in Radio City 's 69-story Rockefeller Tower . These smooth performers differ from Otis elevators in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for braking and for leveling off at each floor . In en- gineering innovations Westinghouse has kept in stride with Otis by matching Otis ' double-decker elevators in Manhattan 's Cities Service Building with a system for running two elevators in the same shaft . But Otis ' great advantage lies in its maintenance operations , which during Depression reputedly accounted for two-thirds of its total business . <P> Most likely field for new elevator business in the near future is that of apartment houses and housing projects . What in view of this appeared to be an extremely astute transaction , was announced by Westinghouse last week : the acquisition of old , privately owned A. B. See Elevator Co. , third largest in the land and a specialist in medium-height elevator jobs .
