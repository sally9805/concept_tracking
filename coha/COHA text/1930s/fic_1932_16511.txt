Her legs are encased in sheer silk hose and her feet are smartly shod . Her black dress is of modish cut , and the satin of her frock is drawn tautly over her thighs , making highlights on her hips and legs .

He picks up the sash-weight rather gingerly and toys with it thoughtfully . Then he suddenly charges on the now almost hysterical witness , and his tone changes to one of booming menace . He waves the sash-weight close to her as she shrinks back and covers her eyes with her hands , in which is a small lace handkerchief . &nbsp; CARDIGAN ( cont 'd ) It was not a Roman Holiday , that bloody February 14 .

In my long career , both as defender and prosecutor , I have had some reputation as a fiery advocate . I come to you today with all fires drawn and a voice robbed of its thunders . A drowning man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last struggle . A man standing on the trap of a gallows perhaps thinks back and re-lives his days from youth to the day of death . My friends , this afternoon I have lived an eternity . By agreement , counsel for the defense and myself are allotted four hours each for our closing addresses . No doubt my friend , Gray will take four hours in which to tell you that Powers was a creature of environment . That he was sent to reform school for burglary . That he never had a chance . That he did n't shoot Duffy , or that Duffy was shot in self defense . ( 625 ) &nbsp; GRAY ( interrupting ) The defense will do its own summing up , Mr. Cardigan . The defense also will have much to say concerning persons who serve time for burglary . ( 626 )  --  140  --  &nbsp; THE COURTGentlemen ! ( 627 ) &nbsp; CARDIGANBut I shall not take four hours to tell my story . I ask you to send Vanny Powers to the gallows on the evidence alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my career . And in so doing , I reveal to you all the mystery that surrounds the case , regardless of what it costs or whom it degrades . The hour has come for me , the District Attorney ; for me , the man who entered this room today , as on other days , with great ambitions ; with the prospect of becoming candidate for governor , if you please , to seek peace of mind and clarity of soul . Do not laugh or think me suddenly daft . ( 628 ) CUT TO 149 INT . COURTROOM - DAY CLOSE SHOT - June . She leans forward and can not hold back an exclamation . &nbsp; JUNETom ! Do n't !

I do not blame him for that . I sacrificed him as I sacrificed everything else on the altar of ambition . I was mad with the desire to become Governor . I was blind with ambition . To achieve my ambitions , I slyly hid what I had been , what I am . A hypocrite . Let this sink in on you deeply . Vanny Powers and I had the same start in life , the same environment . He went to reform school . I know he did , because I was in reform school with him . His counsel has hinted at a burglary episode . I now tell you that Powers and I years ago were found guilty of burglary . ( 631 ) CUT TO 151 INT . COURTROOM - DAY CLOSE SHOT - June . She is horrified .

The jurors look at him in amazement . &nbsp; CARDIGANThe trouble with Powers and myself was that we had the right kind of mothers , but our mothers had the wrong kind of sons . Today , in this court , I softened somewhat when the woman witness was on the stand . For the moment I determined not to cross-examine her . Why ? Because I saw in her another one I had wronged in my mad plunge toward ambition . I saw in her the woman I loved . ( 634 ) &nbsp; GRAYI petition the court to stop this mock-summation , these theatricals. ( 635 ) &nbsp; THE COURTPlease confine yourself to a discussion of the evidence , Mr. District Attorney . ( 636 ) &nbsp; CARDIGANYour Honor , is it mockery to declare one 's innermost soul ? Is it theatrical to realize one 's love , and to repent for one 's errors ? ( 637 ) &nbsp; THE COURT ( to Cardigan ) After all , you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARDIGAN ( proceeding regardless ) Is it mockery to admit what one has hidden all these years , a record that includes burglary ? A record that automatically blocks the road to high office ? Is it going beyond the fact to say that I softened when I saw the woman I loved on the witness stand , that I did not want to hurt her further until  --  ( he turns on Powers )  --  this rat laughed ? That laugh cost me the chance to be Governor . And I trust it will cost him his neck . But what do I care now ? What does anything matter ? Governor 's chair , Powers ' neck , or the flatteries of the public , now that I have lost the one thing I loved beyond all ? ( he turns to June ) The woman who sits there .
