CAME to America in 1934 as a political I exile who could hardly speak English . In 1932 I had become involved in Yugoslav university students ' riots and in printing pamphlets against King Alexander 's dictatorship . I was twenty-seven years of age then , a doctor of political science and a practicing lawyer in Belgrade . Before the political police could seize me I managed to cross the Yugoslav frontier disguised as a peasant . I went to Paris where I spent two years , helping my father ? a former member of the Yugoslav cabinet and also an exile ? to write a book on democracy . I quarreled with the painters of Montparnasse on art , played the violin , and argued with my exiled countrymen in cafs clouded with tobacco smoke about the perfect democratic society . Then I thought I would visit a relative of mine in New York . I signed under oath a long printed paper in English declaring that I was not a bomb thrower , lunatic , or venereal patient , and landed in Manhattan . Corning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was confused by the many incomprehensible contradictions of American life . Yet I found to my astonishment that my American friends thought the French were a crazy people . When they asked me why France has more than twenty political parties , I countered : " Why do you jam Roosevelt , Glass , and Hague all in one party , and Hoover , Borah , and La Guardia together in the other ? " I could not understand why the country with the largest workers ' population in theworld should have no labor party ; why centralization should be advocated by liberals , and States ' Rights defended by big corporations ; why Tom Mooney should be in jail for murder and Al Capone for tax evasion ; why aliens should be regarded with contempt by the sons of aliens ; why religion should be separated from the state , and Darwin 's theory of evolution banned by one State in the name of the Bible ; why bishops should oppose child-labor regulation ; why gangsters and kidnappers should grow up next door to the strange prophets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and OldAge-Pension plans ; why the dictatorships of Louisiana and Jersey City should flourish under a democratic federal Constitution . Only gradually did I begin to grasp the deep significance of American inconsistencies which so strike the set , static mind of a European : to realize that they were mere symptoms of growth , showing a slow trend of the nation toward everincreasing democracy . In this country I experienced for the first time the magnificent feeling of absolute personal freedom . No policeman could stop me in the street or in a restaurant and ask me to show him my papers . I could walk about without carrying an identity card in my pocket , change my address without reporting to the police , and slap a cop on the shoulder just because I was feeling fine . Only a European can appreciate the personal freedom a man enjoys in this country . I decided to stay here ? and went back to France to change my legal clothes . I obtained an immigration visa and , toward the end of 1935 , returned to America as an immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried to get a job in Europe either I could get no appointment or I was treated rudely . Here I was received very politely by bank directors or the heads of law firms . I was helped out of my overcoat , shown a chair , and offered a cigar . Then I would tell my story to an attentive listener . " Right now there is very little I can do for you , " the man behind the desk would say apologetically , " but I shall certainly be glad to get in touch with you if anything should come up . " Then he would take my address and telephone number and escort me to the door . It was not until I reached the street that I realized I had not got the job . It is almost a pleasure to be turned down in this country . Finally I secured work . Despite my four languages and legal training , it was the job of a worker in an Ohio machine shop . It happened this way . Three and a half years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . He teased me , saying that as a newcomer to America I should learn about American life by spending a few months as a worker in his shop . I did not see him again . When , in 1936 , 1 was unable to find a job in New York and found myself penniless , I wrote to him and asked whether he remembered me and his invitation . He replied that he did and renewed his offer . I packed my things and went . Instead of a few months , I spent a whole year in his shop . II When one gray , foggy morning in the beginning of 1937 I got off the train in Cleveland , I became dismayed at the thought of what lay before inc . I did not know a soul in this city . I had never done physical work before . I wanted to return to New York where I had friends . But there was no more money for another train fare and no way out . As I stood in the cold , damp mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the X Company ? " I asked a passer-by . He pointed to a waiting trolley car . Rolling along the dingy , interminable avenue , I began to whistle . The morning sun pierced through the torn rags of dirty fog , and slowly a feeling of glory descended upon me . I was following the old trail that for forty years before me had been trodden by those countless thousands of immigrants from Yugoslavia who had helped to build America . With a few borrowed dollars in my pocket I was on my way to work in an American factory . " It 's a great thing , " I said to myself . It was bitter cold and a heavy snowfall set in as I walked through the gloomy , smoky industrial district to put on overalls for the first time . The huge plant , covering two blocks , all in steel and concrete , was run by electricity . Passing through enormous rooms , I saw countless machines swinging their metal arms through the air like fantastic octopuses , hissing furiously , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were bending rough , athletic-looking workers , with rolled-up sleeves and black caps , their faces grim and smeared with oil and grease , their eyes intent . The so-called " turret lathe " was manufactured in this shop . This is a machine which in its turn makes tools and machine parts . You can fabricate almost anything with it , from automobile parts to bullets . The factory itself was spotless . I had seen orderly European shops , but they had not gleamed with such beautiful cleanliness . was assigned to the second shift . Through underground passages I was led to the Assembly , another huge room where the finished parts of turret lathe machines were put together , tested , and taken apart for shipment . The workers cast curious glances at the newcomer . They were amused at my clumsy attempts to punch the dock and showed me a vacant locker along the left wall where I changed clothes . Then , at four o'clock , the note of the factory bell sounded in my ears , and our shift started off like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool boxes in our hands , we waited in line for the foreman to assign us our jobs . I did rough work on that first night . I swept the floor and picked up waste and dirt with my bare hands . I carried heavy machine parts in my arms or on my shoulders . I screwed big pipes together . A compassionate worker showed me how to hold a file , and with it I smoothed off the edges of five push-button plates . Within fifteen minutes my hands were blistered , my arms impregnated with black metal dust and machine oil , and my mouth full of grease . When I was through at midnight the muscles of my feet , legs , fingers , hands , arms , and back ached terribly . I dragged myself home and slept like a dead man . " How do you feel ? " the foreman asked me as we washed up the following night . I shrugged my shoulders . He winked at another worker and laughed : " It 'll do him good ; in three weeks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory reminded me of a European dictatorial state , where bureaucrats plan and order and citizens work and obey . The board of the Company was the government , and the workers were the people , ruled through a centralized hierarchy of officials and controlled by a mechanized system of registration , bookkeeping , time cards , and punch clocks . Like citizens of authoritarian states , we did our individual assignments without knowing their purpose or the general plan of work . I met a worker whose specialty was to assemble gear boxes to the turret lathe machines and who had no idea what the machines were for . The foreman was our supreme visible authority . With his superiors we could not communicate . And the president , with his board members and directors , sat high above us like art invisible , unapproachable god . Watchmen were stationed inside and outside the building to let nobody in or out except on a special permit . We even had our numbers . Mine was 1941 . I was struck by the contrast between the American worker 's political freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French worker can not conceive a personal freedom which does not include a certain leisureliness at work . So he must work six days a week if the production is not to lag and the production costs to rise . The American worker pays for his two free days by straining his energies under a mechanized discipline during the other five . A German-American worker , who previously had been employed in an automobile plant , said to me : " What are you talking about ? This machine shop is a fine place to work . On my last job , after we 'd won the sit-down strike , the Company made us punch our cards even when we went to the toiled " I have often wondered whether the willingness of the American worker to submit to such regimentation might not be due , not only to his sense of efficiency but also to a general American trait . In spite of their fundamental belief in the democratic form of government , Americans show a certain predilection for personal rule and the " one man " system in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the significant terms " chief " and " boss " so frequently heard . We were only twenty in our group in the Assembly Room , but we were of fourteen different nationalities : Serbs , Slovenes , Croats , Italians , Hungarians , Rumanians , Czechs , Germans , Poles , Swedes , Englishmen , Scotchmen , Irishmen ? even Americans . When , later , I was transferred to other departments , I found Slovaks and Lithuanians in addition . Of course only the older men were foreign-born . The young workers were horn in this country , mostly of foreign parentage at least on one side . They hardly spoke the native languages of their parents and cared little about their old countries . During an entire year I never witnessed a nationalistic dispute among these people . There was something humorous about our racial differences in this American shop . We cracked jokes at one another and imitated the various foreign accents in our English speech . There was an Italian who never took offense when called " Spaghetti . " A pro-Hitler German laughed every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitlerl " at him . " Hey , you You took our country ! " shouted a Hungarian at me from his machine one day , referring to Yugoslavia 's annexation of southern Hun-garian provinces after the World War . " Surel " I retorted , swinging my hammer ; " you had us for a thousand years , and it 's our turn now ! " We both laughed . And yet I knew that in Europe , or even in their native-quarter saloons , these same fellows would fight bitterly on less provocation . International politics were a daily topic . Most foreign-born workers thought they were safer and better off here than they would be overseas . Some Italians were pro-Mussolini , and of course had to take a lot of chaffing . The anti-Fascist Italians did not speak to them . The Germans were rather silent about their beliefs , and it was difficult to find out whether they were for or against Hitler . The reasonable guess was that those who would not divulge their opinions intimately disapproved of the Nazi regime . All workers regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception , they hated General Franco intensely . Most were anti-Communist , but many expressed interest in Soviet Russia 's economic experiment . At first my fellow-workers showed annoyance at my ignorance of a mechanic 's work , but when they realized I had never been in a shop before they were eager to help me . They showed me how to file , hammer , and scrape . They let me usetheir tools , air hoses , and trucks . They pulled heavy crane chains for me ? and fixed up my mistakes . Their sense of comradeship and co-operation was genuine and magnificent . I profited by it greatly ? and so did the Company . A robust Rumanian , after having loaded some eighty pounds on my back one day , said : " So you never work before ? I work when I was sixteen ! " He obviously considered intellectual occupation as just fooling around . Naturally , they were all curious about my background . No matter how hard I tried to conceal it , I would repeatedly give myself away by some such form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " or " Thank you . " They instinctively regarded such politenesses as the social affectation of an upper class . Correct grammar was also a high-hat pretense to them , and I soon caught myself saying " He do n't " or " I says . " Like school children , they loved to throw paper balls and orange peels at one another or to pinch an unsuspecting posterior . After my transfer to the smalltool department I was solemnly escorted to a " weight guesser " who held me on his back , while , surrounded by a roaring crowd of the " brotherhood , " I unexpectedly received three burning slaps on my rear . My unpronounceable last name was a cause of great fun . Everybody practiced it with comical variations . My stern-faced foreman was greeted with loud cheers one night when he gave it up and shouted in desperation : " Where 's that new fellow , what 's his name , Pepperbitch ? " Most of my fellow-workers disapproved of drinking but chewed tobacco enthusiastically . Every night in the Assembly I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams of coffee-brown liquid in an arc over his machine and never missed the spittoon . The stories of some of the immigrant workers were tragic . There was an emaciated Scotchman with a finely chiseled face and trembling hands , who collapsed nearly every week and had to be sent home , his eyes glassy . Years before he had contracted tropical malaria working for a British company in India . A Swede , with all the symptoms of stomach ulcers , lips tightened , skin earthen , drilled and hammered doggedly . From time to time he crouched down behind his machine to endure silently an intolerable pain . A poor Italian , his wile long dead , had to leave his children without supervision while he worked at night in the shop . Almost every year his eldest daughter brought him an illegitimate child . She had been only sixteen when she had the first one . A Croat with an ambassador 's face had been worth fifty thousand dollars before the depression . Left without a cent , he was prevented by his children from committing suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croat was picked up in 1903 at the age of nineteen in a desolate mountain region of Croatia by the agents of an American railroad company , who took him away from his sheep and shipped him off to America . On his arrival in Pennsylvania he was lined up with many others in an open held . The foremen stripped off their coats and examined their muscles as if they had been cattle or African slaves . Still another countryman of mine told me that he came here at the age of thirteen to fell trees with the Negroes in the forests of Virginia . He is a fine machinist now and speaks good English . He made a very significant statement to me : " Nobody knows how many dramas are buried in American shops . Most of our people do not prosper in America because they do not take the trouble to learn English . And they never will as long as they live in racial colonies . " Yet most of the immigrants loved America with a peculiar sense of pride . " We are told to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serbian worker from California . " No , sill This is our country , And our affection for it is all the more deep for having watered it with the sweat of our labor . We made this country what it is today . " I often hear about the unemployment of men over forty . But in this machineshop wherever skill or experience was needed most men were over forty . And even physically many of them had more resistance than the young fellows . lIl I did not really mind being ignorant of a mechanic 's work , I could always ask for help or advice . But unfortunately I belong to that class of persons who become panicky every time they have to hammer a nail or open a stubborn lock . Every worker knew , for instance , how to sharpen a drill on the automatic stone wheel . But in my hands the thing invariably went crooked , and I left part of my skin on the whirling grinder . Stamping numbers on a machine part , I would first hit gently ; the number would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrific whack which , of course , would land right on my knuckles . And the holes I drilled were always cock-eyed . Irritated and impatient , I tried to overcome my subconscious fear of mechanical things by the use of physical force and , naturally , ruined both my work and my hands . It took me a long time to realize that a mechanic 's ability resides in a careful deliberation and calculation of movements rather than in brute strength . I began to observe that my fellow-workers used their hands with caution , sized up every load before lifting it , took care to place their fingers in the right places , and then pushed or pulled with just the required physical energy . When their efforts were unsuccessful they repeated them slowly over and over again . It was a superb lesson in self-control and patience . Like a fine racehorse , a machine wants to be treated firmly , but with kindness and intelligence . " Take your time , my boy , " remarked an old Slovene , watching me tighten some screws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrying . " I was amazed by the tenderness which the workers showed toward the inanimate objects of their labor . " Oh , she 'll be all right again , " said a youngster of a machine he was repairing , and patted it as though it were a sick person . After " tapping " ? cutting screw threads in -- a big turret one night , I left it dripping with oil on the bench and turned to my next job . Immediately a bushy-haired fellow ran up to me and shouted angrily : " You ca n't leave her like that ! Are you a machinist ? " And he neatly wiped it off with his rag . " See ? " he said and looked fondly at the shining metal . I took such rude reprimands without resentment , learning that these men did work of fine quality and that infinite care was the first requirement . Helping to take complicated parts out of the machine ' ' heads " and to replace them , I always had the vivid impression of assisting at an operation on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scrapers , pliers , drills ? were similar to a surgeon 's or dentist 's instruments . A mechanic 's work is surgery on metal . In spite of scale and micrometer , the human eye and hand have the final control . No mechanical device can supplant the craftsman 's sensitive fingers in fitting a bar to a hole , in feeling the evenness of a slide , or in the finishing touch of smoothing and polishing . Whenever I got stuck and called for help , unable to find the cause of trouble , my neighbor would shout over the noise : " Find out ! Think ! " Then he would come closer , look the machine over , and adjust something at the far opposite end which had made my bar in front fit badly . It was this power of quick mechanical diagnosis that my legally , abstractly trained mind could not grasp . But no worker or instructor ever troubled to give me a theoretical explanation of a job . They would say : " Watch mel " then pull a lever , push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to repeat their movements . They would tell me how , but never why . The invisible control of the worker 's activities through bookkeeping and job cards was so ubiquitous and inexorable that the office could at any time find out which worker had put which screw onwhich part , and on what day . Once I broke a small handle . " You ca n't get away with that ; they 'll find it out , " said a man who saw me do the damage . " You 'd better go to the foreman and report . " Every operation , no matter how small , had to be accomplished within the prescribed standard time , marked on special cards . On my first day in the shop I was warned by fellow-workers not to " ring out " my cards before the allotted time was up , or the office would cut down the standard norm for everybody . This had been tacitly agreed by them all to prevent the management from speeding us up . Whoever " rang " less than one hundred per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took no steps against this . But the collective work of a shift could sometimes be speeded up imperceptibly . One week we were told we were to work six days and be paid time and a half for overtime . When Friday came the foreman said he had changed his mind . Asked why , he answered : " The department has caught up . " In other words , under his continual gentle urging during that week we had all worked slightly faster , with the result that the shift accomplished six days ' work in five days for five days ' pay . Most men disliked the time-card system . " I like to do a good job but I hate to have a time limit for it , " said a German scraper to me . It was easy to keep to time norms either in very simple or in very mechanized jobs ; but when the quality of each piece depended on the skill of the worker 's hands , the uniform time rules became meaningless bureaucratic measures . Once I took three hours and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on eight parts . Another time I took nine hours . In spite of the time cards the foremen had to give us individual allowances on all quality jobs . One night as the " pay man " distributed our checks , a bad-tempered Swede flung his on the floor and spat on it . Shaking his fists he roared : " They deduct money for social security , for the community fund , for hospital insurance , and I have to pay my union dues and the income tax . God damn it , I work for everybody except myself ! " " I am afraid , " I tried to pacify him , " you 'll have to pick up your check anyway . " The workers work hard all their lives and get enough for a living , sometimes a comfortable living , but never enough to stop working . " Once in a shop , always in a shop , " was the gloomy refrain in every department . Sitting on wooden boxes or machine levers at lunch or dinner time , we often exchanged confidences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake their heads telling of twenty , thirty years spent in shops . The young ones would dreamingly speak of their hopes for the future . A fine machine operator said bitterly : " I get sick looking at this machine . Shall I run it when I am fifty ? What a life ! " Another hoped to get an office job some day . Still another dreamed of becoming a schoolteacher . He had finished high school ; then he had got married , had had two children , and had gone into the shop instead of to college . Most wanted to go into " business for themselves " some day . Not one wished to remain a shop worker . Discussing the reasons for the complete failure of the Marxist class ideology in this country , Mr. George Sokoisky said once that the American worker is merely a capitalist without money . I do not think that this is quite correct . My fellow-workers did not like being laborers but they also had no desire to become employers . They wanted to be on their own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not proletarian nor was it capitalist ; it was typically middleclass . IV We had an " open shop . " Most men were unorganized . Of the rest , a larger part belonged to the AFL , and a smaller to the CIO . The organized workers were not always ready to divulge their affiliations , so that the exact strength of these groups could not be ascertained . Once I met a man who pretended to be a CIO sympathizer and later admitted AFL membership . Some workers actually signed up for both organizations . It was particularly hard to tell whether the unorganized workers were really indifferent or had secret leanings . Only a few expressed themselves outspokenly . Sometimes when I was going to the factory I would pass a couple of men at the gates distributing CIO leaflets . The mimeographed handbills did not assail the rival union directly , but attacked the Company and called upon the workers to join " the only powerful , militant union . " Then in all departments AFL notices would appear calling the members to a meeting to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole year . There was no disturbance , except that one afternoon when I arrived at work I found the day men sitting on the floor smoking . The first shift of the entire plant had gone on a sit-down strike to force the Company to fire a man . Some said that he was a CIO committee man who had gone over to the AFL . Some , that he was a Communist . Some , that he was a Company spy . Some , that they did not know . Whatever the charge against him may have been , he was fired , and the second shift resumed work . Many unorganized workers felt apathetic toward unionism . They either saw no reason to pay the dues or resented the AFL-CIO strife . " When two unions fight each other , " said an old workingman , " it is the Company which profits , not the workers ; until they settle their affairs I wo n't join either of them . " But a union member was quick to reply : " You are helping the Company if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " In the Assembly the CIO seemed to have more sympathizers than the AFL . The Assembly workers were mostly common laborers . They did not know much about " vertical " and " horizontal " unionism , but disliked the upper labor crust and looked upon the CIO as an organization of commoners . One day I was transferred to the Small Tool Department . Here most of the workers looked like real artisans , distinguished , middle-aged , or elderly . Everybody worked at his own machine or bench , quite for himself . There was no such collective activity as in the Assembly . The men had a contempt for " mass psychology . " They were not too familiar with one another , did not swear or laugh loudly , and seemed to dislike common manners as well as common labor . They were almost all members of the AFL . An officer of the AFL Local took the trouble to explain to me at length that social distinction between the skilled and unskilled workers was necessary . " We ca n't mix with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One Saturday the Company took us , a group of young workers , to see an Ohio foundry some forty miles away in the country . In the humid , suffocating air of what looked to me like a subterranean prison , I watched workers covered with dirt and shining with sweat struggling with heavy molds of cast iron . Others , stripped to their waists in the unbearable heat , tended the huge blazing furnace . Horrified that there should be people who spent all their lives doing such work , I spoke to a youthful mechanic . He shrugged his shoulders and replied dryly : " Somebody 's got to do it . These fellows arc no good for anything else . " It dawned upon me that there are as many class differences within American Labor as exist within the nation . We all believe that youth is by nature revolutionary , and old age conservative . I was surprised , therefore , to observe that social discontent was more frequent among the old than among the young generation in the shop . While the older men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned employers , the young ones talked sports , movies , dancing , and , eventually , Japan . The older fellows were bitter because they had gone through the depression and had no more hope of recovering . They were interested in unionism because they felt a need for protection . On the whole my fellow-workers were less interested in politics than are European workers . I heard no ideological arguments . While in Europe unionism plays an important part as an instrument of the labor parties in their struggle for political power and control of government , here it was presented to me merely as a paying proposition . " The union , " I was told by an AFL man , " will fight for your raise . Therefore the dues you pay are sort of an investment . " Questioned about the reasons for the heavy dues in the AFL , an officer explained : " Members do n't quit easily an organization to which they have paid large sums of money . " Yet in spite of the complete absence of a Marxian point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the management , that atmosphere of mutual mistrust which is at the bottom of every class antagonism . The office people were inclined to assume that the workers would naturally like to do as little work as possible for as much money as they could get . The workers , on the other hand , were convinced that the management made profits by obtaining the maximum of work for a minimum of pay . In every move of the Company they suspected a trick . Their mental attitude unconsciously adopted the doctrine of class exploitation . In November , 1937 , the management announced a bonus for all the workers then in their employ ? and laid off a number of men a few days later . The " layoffs " continued . Every two or three weeks the foremen made the rounds of their departments . We knew that the fellows by whom they stopped to say a few words were working that night for the last time . Within some three months the labor force was cut down to two thirds , and the three-day week became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the men that the new depression was caused by a " business sit-down " and forced by the " big shots " to sabotage the President . Indignation and fear grew every day . Fighting for existence , the workers began to mistrust not only the Company but one another . They lied to one another about their wages . The more skilled resented the less skilled staying on the job . The older ones wanted the younger ones to get out first . Everybody was anxious to punch his time cards one hundred per cent . And many jealously kept their time-saving tricks from others . Yet there was no general feeling of panic . Last January they still believed that the recession was temporary . Then there was the Relief . And those who had savings in banks knew they were safe . I had been told that before the great depression American workers , like all Americans , were encouraged by the current business philosophy to be spendthrifts and to live like millionaires on the installment plan . On my first day of work I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory parking place ? like a bankers ' convention . But the American worker 's economic psychology is undergoing a great change . Time and again I was warned by the older workmen : " My son , save every cent ! You do n't know how long you 're going to keep your job . " Never in my life have I so often been asked whether I was married and why I was not . Practically everybody in the shop had a wife . The fact that I was a bachelor did not please my fellow-workers and counted definitely against my character . Once I said I did not want to get married . " What are you living for ? " a young worker asked me contemptuously . " I was married when I was eighteen , " he added defiantly and turned his back on me . Another youngster , who at twenty-four had a six-year-old child , wondered : " What the hell are you waiting for ? " This was strange to me , for in Europe I had been brought up to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working masses . And yet swear words , dirty jokes , and foul expressions were in common use all over the shop . Some fellows kept pornographic booklets and pictures and enjoyed showing them secretly to oneanother . The rear of the factory bordered on a Negro district , and on sunny afternoons black women ? or " brown peachies , " as the workers called them ? leaned over the window sills or stood on their wooden balconies . Gathered at the factory windows across the street , the workers complimented them with bawdy invitations . But I soon sensed that their obscenity was only an emotional release . Divorce and adultery were rare among them . They just liked to pretend to be over-sexed . On winter nights lonely pedestrians were exposed to frequent hold-ups in the deserted streets between the plant and my living quarters . Walking home once after midnight in the dim light of the avenue , I saw the slim , figure of a young blonde woman emerge from a restaurant ahead of me . A man , rather unsteady on his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , narrow street . Soon I heard the light steps of the woman running behind me . Catching up with me , she said , panting : - Would you mind taking me to the next avenue ? I 'm afraid of this man . " She was pretty . " All right , " I replied , smiling and wary of a frame-up at the same time , " but this is not the place nor the hour for pretty girls to be . " She shivered arid said nothing . The man , muttering , was close on our heels , and I carefully watched his shadow on the pavement in front of me . As we reached the corner a black car came swinging round and stopped . There was a man behind the wheel . The young woman hesitated for a moment , whispered : " Thank you ! " and rushed into the car . The drunk on the sidewalk swore , I bowed like a disappointed cavalier , and the automobile dashed off in the dark . The following night I again heard steps behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for the X Company ? " he asked me brusquely . There had been labor troubles in the city , unrest among the workers , and a half-day sit-down strike in our plant . " Yes , " I said , bracing myself . " Did you pick up the girl last night ? " The dark fellow looked searchingly into my eyes . " Yes , " I repeated more defiantly , ready for a fight . " I was in that car , " he continued mote softly and looked away . " I also work for the X Company , and she 's my wife . You see , she works nights near here , and I usually meet her with the car after work . Last night I was late . She told me you protected her from a man who annoyed her . Thank you . " I relaxed . We walked on together and became friends . V At work a curious mental trance would occasionally take possession of me . I came to like monotonous jobs which Ieft my mind free . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would begin to play before my eyes , and the factory would seem a fantastic vision where I saw workers and machines only through a mist . At such moments my fingers worked with relentless , mechanical speed . Once I turned threads in 270 holes and made altogether more than 6,000 identical arm movements . My mind sank into a complete oblivion of the world , and all night I swam in hallucinations and reveries like a drug addict . In the fall I was transferred to the Machining Department , a huge white room where countless machines were lined up in impeccably straight rows , and the noise was so hellish that one had to shout into one 's neighbor 's ear . There I had the thrill of my life starting and stopping the motor , putting my turret lathe into high or low speed , throwing it into reverse , pulling the levers and handles , turning the wheels , and watching the indicators . The docile monster responded sensitively to every touch of my hand and turned out identical finished pieces at equal intervals . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming at work . The slightest mistake in the synchronization of movements resulted in a damage to the machine , the product , or my hands . Every day there came a moment when the attention suddenly gave out from overstrain , and an attack of dizziness made things swim before the eyes . I was advised by older workers to stop working for a while at such moments . I have often read that , generally , the two or three first hours of work are the most productive . That is not always true . In the Machining Department we regularly took one or two hours to " warm up . " Then , after several hours of efficient work , a short period of mental weakness and distraction would set in . Renewed concentration would follow , and during the last one or two hours we worked at our best and fastest ? because subconsciously we strove to get home . It was fascinating to measure the .001 part of an inch with a micrometer . But it took me some time to learn to read a blue-print drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose you get a blue print calling for 75 screws which have to be made of a 5/8 hexagonal steel bar . The length of the head must be 5/16 of an inch , and the length of the body , 1 inch and 11/16 . The thread must fit the gauge and be 1 inch long . Both . And the width of the narrow round body of the screw must be turned down to 1/2 an inch minus .003 of an inch . Well , I did it one night , set up the machine for the job , figured out everything with scales and micrometers , and made the called-for number of screws in the prescribed time , and the foreman checked and approved my work . But often I got hopelessly stuck . Then the assistant would come along , throw all my pieces into the scrap pan because they were .002 of an inch undersized , and reset the machine for me . It was exceedingly difficult for my theoretically trained mind to acquire a machinist 's fine sense for exact physical measurements . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate legal case . There was a symphony of strange noises in the Machining Department . Some machines beat like the tom-toms of the jungle . Some puffed like locomotives . Some whistled , hissed , or howled . Some hummed or purred gently like cats . The steel under the cutter screamed like a human being , and when the huge machine drill pierced a one-foot iron bar the room resounded with the angry roaring of a lion . The men , grimly earnest , worked in tense concentration . Suddenly somebody would shout : " Hey ! " A chorus of men would answer him , yelling at the top of their voices . Then they would fall back into silence for hours . Again a laugh would ring out from a corner . For a moment all the men would stop their work , and the entire place would echo with nerve-racking laughter . At first I felt uneasy every time I saw the men lift their heads from the machines . But later I too was carried away and howled with them- It was fun . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental tyranny of the machine . VI Years ago I had an ambition to become a concert violinist . I am glad I never became one . But I kept up violin playing with that zeal and determination that distinguishes the stubborn amateur , and after some months in Cleveland I began to be asked to play the violin at musical parties in the evenings . I found that many workers in the shop were musical . Some sang , some played instruments , some were members of choirs and bands . One night in the Assembly I whistled the leading tune from the first movement of the Beethoven violin concerto . A handsome young Pole looked up : " Do you sing ? " " No , " I replied , " I fiddle . " " I sing , " he explained , " and I knew you must be a musician the way you whistle . " We talked music all night while I washed the machines with rags dipped in kerosene and he screwed bolts on them . When my people overseas heard that I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much about the physical hardships I should have to endure as about the social humiliation I should have to suffer . Professional and class standards are so set in Europe that an intellectual who resorts to physical work for a living is considered ( Mc-lasse . Here I saw the sons of rich lawyers and business men spend their college vacations working in a shop . America ? we all know ? has long ceased to be a pioneer country ; but ideas often survive the facts , and certain social standards of the pioneer era still persist here . One of them is respect for physical work . In no European country could I come home all dirty from shop work , lay off my working clothes , take a bath , put on a dinner coat , and play the Cesar Franck or the Brahms D-Minor violinpiano Sonata before an audience in evening clothes at some private house . One day I was asked by a prominent local organization to give a series of lectures on Central Europe and the Balkans . I spotted a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last lecture I put on my overalls again ; but my anonymity in the shop had been completely killed by the newspaper publicity , and I was afraid the workers might resent me . As I took the elevator I was greeted with hearty shouts : " Hey , Doer " or " Here comes the Docl " They were interested to know whether there was more money in lecturing than in machine running . I told them that , for the time being , I would rather stick to my machine . After a full year spent in the factory I returned to New York . Looking back upon my year-long experience in this American shop , I am fully aware that it does not give a general picture of the American industrial life . One can arrive at a just evaluation of it only by comparing it with industrial conditions elsewhere , here and abroad . We were paid at an average rate of 84 cents an hour . We worked 40 hours a week , in clean , healthy surroundings . We were given time and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cultural activities . We had a two weeks ' vacation with pay . We were treated fairly as men and as workers . The foremen were willing to make exceptions in emergencies and to help out in trouble . Not seldom they would give us time-saving jobs ( the so-called " good jobs " ) when we were behind on our time cards But the people whose character left the deepest impression on me were the workers . Humaneness and sympathy were concealed under their brusque ways and manners . On their faces , which sometimes reminded me of those of the peasants in my old country , lines of dishonesty or wickedness were rarely to be found . Many of them came from distant , forlorn corners of the United States , or from faroff , backward countries ; they grew into the soil of a new community , excelled at work , and managed to give their children better care than they had enjoyed . When I think how tremendously handicapped they were by lack of means as well as of background and education , I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were men of simple taste and reasonable , sane attitude toward life . No fanaticism colored their discontent . And their ambitions were undistorted by megalomaniac wishes to make " a career " or do " great things . " Their objectives in life were within the limits of the possible . Again and again I feel compelled to reflect upon the question which that young married worker once put to me : " What are you living for ? "
