txt The three survivors of the ? 1 . S. S. Akron left here by airplane for Washington to testify before a naval board of inquiry into the crash of the huge navy dirigible off Barnegat light Monday night . Meanwhile , United states naval vessels and aircraft continued to search the New Jersey and Virginia coast lines hoping to pick up other survivors and to salvage wreckage from the airship . Lieut. - Conunander Herbert Lee Wiley , the only surviving officer of the Akron ; Boatswain 's Mate Richard E. Deal , and Metalsmith M. Erwin slipped out of a back door of the United States Naval Hospital in Brooklyn into a waiting automobile and went to Floyd Bennett Airport . where they took an airplane for Washington . They said they would report to Rear Admiral Pratt , chief of naval operations , on their arrival at the caiptal . Appear Fully Recovered They were apparently fully recovered from their experiences aboard the Akron , wherein ' 13 of their comrades were lost . Early in the day they testified before a local board of inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akron 's chief radio operator , on board the oil tanker Phoebus . Meanwhile , the theory that the Akron was struck by lightning is being discarded and the consensus is that the airship ran into a storm . the peculiar nature of which forced her down into the sea . Support of this theory is found by meteorologists in the account of the crash of the Akron given by Lieut. - Commander Herbert V. Wiley , U. S , N. , the only officer aboard the Akron who survived the wreck . They hold that in all probability powerful vertical air currents forced the airship down . Commander Wiley , in an interview at the United States Naval Hospital in Brooklyn yesterday , and later , speaking over a nation-wide radio hookup , described a violent storm into which the Akron rode , with lightning flashes all about her , Monday night . While he refused to give any opinion regarding the cause of the crash , he discredited reports that the airship had been struck by lightning . " I do not think the ship was struck by lightning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " although there was plenty if lightning all around us . " He said that just before the crash , the air became " exceedingly turbulent and the ship was tossed about violently . " This was a sign , he added , that they were near the center of the storm , " because the sir is most disturbed near the : enter . " Discovering this , he immediately gave the signal for all hands at landing stations . Commander Wiley praised the heroism of the crew and officers on the Akron . The order " Stand by for crash " caused neither disorder nor confusion , he said . The men in the control car stood calmly by their pests , and orders to the engineers in charge of the motors were carried out promptly to the last , he said . Commander Wiley 's story was told in terse sentences delivered in a matter of fact manner as though he were rendering an official report to a superior officer Warning the reporters that he could give no opinions nor technical observations , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Lakehurst the previous evening . On Scheduled Flight " We left Lakehurst last night at 7:30 o'clock on a regularly scheduled flight . " he said . " One object of the flight was to calibrate some radio stations in New England . Since this calibration could not begin until daylight , and it was foggy over the sea , we decided  --  or rather , it was decided to cruise inland where the ground could be seen , and we were over Philadelphia about 8:10 and headed south , following the Delaware River . It was expected it would be foggy south of New Jersey and that the fog at sea would clear in the morning . " About 8:45 last night , when 20 or 30 miles south of Philadelphia , lightning was seen ahead and in a few minutes we had a report of a thunderstorm over Washington . We headed east and northeast , toward the ocean , flying at about 1600 feet altitude . " The ground was obscured by fog , but we knew our position quite accurately and occasionally we would glimpse a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our course . The ship was in good flying condition , slightly heavy . " The lightning to the south , became quite extensive and also appeared to the west . About 10 p. m. , just after we had left the Jersey coast  --  that is , we were over the water  --  the storm became general all around us . " I do not think the ship was struck by lightning , as there was no indication of it at any time , although there was plenty of lightning all around us . In Center of Storm " We continued to the eastward for about-one . hour and then reversed the course . When we reached the land again , we saw a group of lights and identified the shore line . This was about midnight and the course MO changed to the southeast . About 30 minutes later , the ship began to descend rapidly from about 1600 feet and I dropped emergency ballast forward , and the fall was stopped at about 800 feet . " We rose rapidly and leveled off at 1600 feet again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full speed and when we regained altitude changed to standard speed again . " About three minutes later , the air became exceedingly turbulent and the ship was tossed about violently . I knew we were near the center of the storm , because the air is most disturbed near the center , and called all hands for landing stations  --  that I gave the signal for all hands to landing stations to have them available and not in their bunks . " The ship took a sharp lurch and the rudder control wires to the upper rudder carried away . " Replying to a question at this point , Commander Wiley said the control wires to the upper rudder " carried away  --  they broke . " " Stand By for Crash " " I unclutched the upper rudder and tried to steer with the lower rudder , " he continued . " I was on the right side  --  that is , the starboard sicie  --  of the control tower and superintended the rudder and the captain was on the left side and superintended the elevators ; that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had the steerman steer with the lower rudder . However , within leas than a minute afterward , I heard a popping noise and the lower rudder control rope was also broken . " The elevator man repeated several times that the ship was falling and heard him report ? ' 890 feet ' By this time the bow of the ship was inclined up about 20 degrees , but the ship was failing quite rapidly , " In the fog nothing could be seen . I asked the altitude and the answer was ' 300 feet " I gave the order , ' stand by for crash , ' and that signal was rung up to the engine cars . Almost immediately we hit the water . " We had , as I remember , a list to starboard , to my side of the control car . Water rushed in the windows on my side , carried me out the windows on the otheg side of the control car . as tried to swim away as.rapidly as I could to get from under the ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship drifting away as the lightning flashed . The bow was up in the air and the whole structure was a general wreck . " I saw two lights on what I thought was the stern . On one side I saw the lights of a ship . " I also thought I could see the for its trial flights , and there is possibility that it will be stationed in the East rather than on the Pacific coast , as had been planned , as a result of the Akron 's loss . Certain it is that a searching investigation of the causes of this morning 's disaster will speedily take place . Effects of this probe on airship policy are expected to be far-reaching . Chances are certainly great at this writing that the United States blessed with all advantages for airship experimentation , such as helium gas and enormous rubber companies , will take the same sine as all great powers save Germany . Recalling Germany 's success with the Graf Zeppelin , airship experts here are reiterating that Dr. Hugo Eckener , the world 's greatest dirigible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to avoid electrical storms . Thus , coupled with his expert handling under all conditions , he has been able to take the Graf Zeppelin on its astounding cruises , which have almost become a matter of routine Some of his conservatism , it is hinted here , is needed in control of American airships . London Hopes Inquiry May Increase Safety By Press Wireless from Monitor Bureau LONDON , April ** that a thorough inquiry into the Akron disaster may develop facts which , combined with British experience , may bring new safety to lighter-than-air transportation , was expressed in aviation circles here . This hope was combined with expressions of sympathy as word of the wreck of the world 's largest commissioned airship reached London . The Akron mishap , together with the crash of the R-101 at Beauvais , France , on Oct. 5 , 1930 , make clearer than ever before a reassessment of the technique of airship construction navigation necessary , British aeronauuscal opinion indicates .

Experience gained from exhaustive inquiry after the crash of the R-101 was made fully mailable to American experts . Although actuated largely by reasons of economy , England discontinued the lighter - than - air craft experiment and construction , technical experts of the Air Ministry continued to follow all new developments , especially in the United States , and had been guests on previous Akron flights . World Nations Extend Sympathies Over Akron By the Associated Press Foreign nations joined the United States today in mourning the loss of the dirigible Akron 's men . King George of Great Britain sent the following message to President Roosevelt : " I am greatly shocked by news of the disaster which has overtaken the airship Akron , involving the loss of so many gallant lives , and I hasten to express to you .

Designer and Builder To Study Akron Crash Special to The Christian Science Monitor AKRON , Ohio , April ** of the disaster to the Akron are to be sought by the designer and the president of the building company , who are going to New York and Washington to assist in the official investigations . They go partly with a view to applying any lessonl learned to the sister ship , Macon , which was recently christened and will soon be launched . Dr. Karl Arnsteln , designer of both ships , said that in the absence of other than meager reports he was at a loss to understand what caused the wreck . He Could not conceive of any fault in the construction , in view of the fact the ship has withstood severe ordeals successfully . Mr. Paul W.

Akron , when delivered to the Navy Department , was 18,181 pounds overweight and six knots slower than specifications , but Dr. Arnstein pointed out the ship had really been strengthened because of those features . Two Akron men , Lieutenant Karl Fickes and Ensign Frank Trotter , of the Naval Reserve , who missed being aboard the Akron by only four days , declare the ship was in excellent condition when they left Lakehurst last week after a nine months ' tour of duty aboard the ship . Upsurge Against Dirigibles Annears to Be Growing WASHINGTON , April 5 VP/ ?

One of the principal exhibits at the investigation of the Akron disaster will be a curious piece of wreckage somewhat resembling a stove pipe , about 16 inches in diameter and 5 feet long , picked up by the coast guard cutter and turned over to the navy last night . Officials said they believed it was a section of the ventilating duct which carried air to the living quarters of the dirigible . It is dura-lumin , a light aluminum alloy , and is wrapped in kapok .
