Up to last week the reflecting surface of Mount Wilson Observatory 's 100-inch glass mirror , world 's largest telescope reflector in use , was covered with a thin film of silver . If it were coated with aluminum , as all Mount Wilson astronomers have long wished , it would quickly acquire a protectively oxidized surface , it could be cleaned with ordinary soap and water and it would seldom if ever have to be removed from the telescope tube . <P> Last week Mount Wilson 's big mirror got its first coat of aluminum , a film .00001 in. thick . The method of application was developed by Dr. John Donovan Strong and others from a plating process first hit upon by Thomas Edison . The glass disk is first thoroughly cleaned with blasts of electrons . It is then placed in a big sealed tank from which pumps suck almost all the air . Within the tank is a coil of tungsten wire covered with aluminum . When the wire is electrically heated the aluminum boils off as a vapor which , when it strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even film .
