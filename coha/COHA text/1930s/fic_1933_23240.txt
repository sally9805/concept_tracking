COLLOQUE SENTIMENTAL A STORY BY GRIFFITH BEEMS M ISS NACHTIGAL was taking dictation . With her stenographic pad on her thigh , she sat in the morocco-upholstered chair beside Mr. Dutton 's desk and waited . Mr. Dutton had been dictating for two hours . He had swung away from her , facing the silver-mounted French telephone , so that she lost his prepositions and suffixes when he spoke ; but Mr. Dutton did not like to be interrupted . He wrote the corrections in her letters in ink , which compelled her to retype the page . When he faced her and she could hear every syllable , she thought about David and the preceding evening ; but when he turned away she had to be more attentive . Now while she waited , with the tip of her carefully sharpened pencil she traced in the air , idly and minutely , the outline of Mr. Dutton 's lower lip , chin , second chin , neck , and collar . Mr. Dutton was in his forties . He sat massively upright with his arms folded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said finally , " cost analy-ses and survey dat-a could not be more conclusive we happen to know that Southern Latex and Rubber is working along the same line speed in getting into production is essential we want to hear from you by January thirty-first at the very latest very truly yours sign as chairman of the board . " Mr. Dutton got up , hitched at his trousers , stamped , stretched and , walking to one of the four windows , looked down on the asphalt roofs between the Woolworth Building and the river . " Tired , Miss Nachtigal ? " " Oh , no . " " Never get tired working , do you ? Well , I do . " Mr. Dutton was a large man . His body in the window hid half of Jersey City . From under his armpit as he stretched issued a tug on the North River . " I 'm tired of working right now . " He turned and looked down at his secretary , seated in the overstuffed chair . Her fingers , as she stretched them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black wool-cr  --  pe dress and , extending her legs , she knocked the toes of her shoes together . Then she relaxed . Mr. Dutton withdrew his steel-rimmed glasses from his breast-pocket , found his handkerchief and , putting one foot up on the radiator underneath the window , he rubbed at his eyes . He transferred his glasses and handkerchief from one hand to the other and back and poked at the russet silk draperies with his fist . " What do you do when you 're tired , Miss Nachtigal ? " " It all depends . " " It all depends . That 's exactly what my wife would say . But saying it never helps any , " cleaning his glasses with his handkerchief . " You 're a clever girl . What would you recommend for a man that 's tired , dog tired ? " " I 'd take a couple of aspirins and lie down for a while . " They laughed together . " You do n't help me one bit , " he said . " Not one bit , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiator and walked across the large oak-panelled room , putting on his glasses as he went , and stopped in front of an English sporting print . He looked from another window northward at the roofs . He stood , tapping his fingers on the desk , moved the telephone several inches , sat down , tapped with his fingers , swivelled toward her . Miss Nachtigal selected one from among her three pencils , examined the point , crossed her knees , and waited . " Put your pencil down . I 'm not going to dictate . Not yet . Put it down . Please . We 're still resting . " He laughed , reassuringly affable . " Let 's see . You 've been my secretary more than two years now , isn t it ? " " Yes , sir . " " We never talk much , do we ? " " No . " Mr. Dutton paused to clean his glasses again and to compose his next remark . " I suppose you 're the new generation I read about . Two different people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business hours . How about it , Miss Nachtigal ? Are you the emancipated modern woman ? " " I do n't think so , " she smiled . " I live very quietly . " " That 's not a very incriminating answer . I wonder if it would seem quiet to an old fogy like me . I suppose you have an apartment in Greenwich Village , lots of parties , lots of young men , lots of fun . I think Mrs. Abbott told me once that you lived in Greenwich Village . " " I did for a month or two several years ago . That was when I first came here . I was down in the stenographic room then . But by the time you 've worked for five or six years , as I have , you are n't willing to put up with a furnished room and a gas heater that takes an hour to get the chill off when you come home . Not if you can afford better . I live in a business women 's club on Forty-Seventh Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't they ? " Mr. Dutton swung suddenly around ; the mechanical swivel crunched under his weight ; he went to the window . " They would , I know . I 'm positive they would , " he ran on , " I know how young men are . " His breath clouded on the cold windowpane . " That 's the way they would be with a girl like you . " " You are mistaken . I live very quietly . " " Yes , of course , " he admitted hurriedly . He turned toward her and put one foot on the radiator . " You 're a nice girl . I did n't mean  --  I do n't doubt what you say . I know you 're a nice girl . " Abruptly he took his foot down . " You must pardon me . I do n't mean to be disrespectful , putting my foot up like that . I forget . I forget you are n't another man . " " Certainly , Mr. Dutton . Please do n't bother about such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , that 's right No . No . That 's all for to-day . " He watched the automatic arm dosing the office door after her . " Holy , holy , holy , " he said , turning to the window , He sighed against the pane . A spot of moisture lengthened under his sigh and as it went away , the edges withering inwardly , he renewed and enlarged it . He stood , panting soberly against the pane . With his forefinger he wrote on the cloud , read over the words , hurriedly rubbed them out , and breathed again upon the glass . January 31 Miss Nachtigal closed her notebook , collected the extra pencils lying on Mr. Dutton 's desk , and stood up . One hand smoothed at her skirt and with a twisting movement she settled her dress slightly from the shoulders . " You have n't dictated anything on the Achilles Waterproofing matter . It was to come up again to-day . It 's on the pad . " Mr. Dutton read the memorandum . " Sure enough , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go get the file . Please . " When she returned , he leafed the top pages of the file . " They have n't answered , so I 'm not going to bother . Put it down again for the fifteenth . " " Is there anything else ? " " Well , yes  --  and no . " " Shall I wait ? " " You know , Miss Nachtigal , I think you 're avoiding me . " " Avoiding you ? " Miss Nachtigal deliberately smiled . " No , Mr. Dutton , I 'm not avoiding you . Quite the contrary . I come whenever you ring . " The torsion spring in his chair sang as he tipped slowly backwards . " You know , do n't you ? " he said . She did not answer until she got to the door . " Yes , " she said over her shoulder , opening the door , " I know . " The automatic arm closed the door carefully . Mr. Dutton rang . He gripped his thumb on the electric button , waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he ordered . " You must n't run away like that . Go on , sit down . I want to talk about this . I 've dozens of things to ask you . I like to talk to you , but you 're always putting me off . You 're a very clever young woman , Miss Nachtigal . I 'm almost afraid of you . So you knew all along . How did you know ? Tell me that . " " Do n't you think it would be more sensible of us to leave matters as they are ? " " Now , now . You take this too seriously . Certainly not . You must n't keep on putting me off this way . There 's no harm in talking to each other calmly . Your knowing now  --  I ca n't get over that  --  it interests me tremendously . How did you know ? " " You 're sure that you ought to have your own way ? " " Positive . Begin . " " Beginnings are hard . Let 's see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first bottle of Scotch . Or more probably the day you began taking your feet off the desk when I came in . And certainly the day you accused me of having lots of men make love to me . But then , how should I know ? It gets in the air , affects the nerves , makes you drop things . I 'm not quick at diagnosis . " " You 're laughing at me . " " I 'm just doing as you said  --  not being too serious any more . " " You 're angry , are n't you ? " " No , it 's a compliment . " " That 's right . That 's the way I intended it . I just ca n't help myself . I never thought about you at all until one day all of a sudden I noticed  --  Iyou do n't know what a relief it is finally to speak out about it . II  --  listen , Miss Nachtigal , what are we going to do about this ? " " Nothing . " They looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became portentous and strained . " I can understand how you look at it , " he said , lowering his eyes . " I suppose I 'm just an old fool . I do n't know what to make of it . I 'm no woman chaser , Miss Nachtigal . No , I 'm not . I 've had dozens of secretaries , but this never happened to me before . It floors rne . It seems as though something could be done about it . I mean I feel better for it . I 'm glad to come to the office in the morning  --  have you noticed how much earlier I get in nowadays ? I was here by half-past nine this morning . Did you notice ? " " I had noticed that several mornings you got here ahead of me . " She spoke drily . " Yes , " he said . " Yes , when I get up in the morning now , I think I 'm going to the office , and when I ring she 'll come in , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bandbox . You do n't know how neat and attractive you are . You 're like  --  you 're like a young tree . " Miss Nachtigal had been looking at the unornamented hands folded in her lap . Now she looked up , smiling . Mr. Dutton hesitated , grinned . " That 's what I mean , " he said , laughing . " I stand to it . A young tree . " " It 's very flattering , but you know as well as I do , Mr. Dutton , that there are hundreds of reasons why you must n't go on like this . No office can be run on this basis . " " Now , now . You are n't Mrs. Abbott , thank heaven . You do n't look like her and you need n't talk like her . The mere fact of a man being in love for the first time in his life need n't harm anyone . " " I 'd be surprised if it did n't . Anyway , if this is going to go on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Resign ? " Charging at her in her chair , he put both his hands on her shoulders . " Listen , " he said , shaking her , " I do n't want to hear another word about resigning . You 're indispensable to me , Miss Nachtigal . Do you hear ? Indispensable . Whatever I say or do , you must n't think of resigning . If I do anything you do n't like , you just must n't pay any attention . Promise me that you wo n't ever think of resigning . Promise . " She looked straight before her at the six buttons on his vest . " I promise . " He sat down . " You understand , Mr. Dutton , I do n't want to resign . I like working for you . I think we work well together . And sixty-dollar-a-week jobs do n't grow on bushes . But this thing will have to stop . I want you to promise , too . " " I would , but what would be the use ? After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like a boy again . What 's the harm in that ? I ca n't help looking at you . I ca n't help watching you walk around , can I ? Do n't be too hard on me . I 'll just say a word now and then to let you know how good I feel . I promise not to bother you . That ought to be enough . " " All right , " she said smiling . " That ought to be enough . Now may I get this dictation out ? " " Yes . It 's a bargain between us , is n't it ? " Tipping backward in his chair , he smiled up at her . " We used to seal bargains in my day , " he chuckled . " Your word is sufficient , " she said , walking quickly to the door . Mr. Dutton opened the top desk drawer . He had the box of cigars in his hand when he noticed the nail file . He put the box of cigars back , closed the drawer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " I 'm only forty-three . " April 19 Miss Nachtigal ground out her cigarette and left it in the howl with seven others . She heard Mr. Dutton coming heavily down the outside corridor . " You still here ? " he said . " I 'm sorry . I forgot all about you . " He slumped into his chair without taking off his spring topcoat . " No use your waiting . There is n't going to be any dictation . " He slid his derby across the desk viciously . " The deal 's off . " " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I know you counted on it . " " Counted on it ? " With a large paper-pin he jabbed at his blotter . " Counted on it . If you want to know what happened , in words of one syllable , " jabbing through the blotter into the desk , " I failed . That 's what happened . I thought I was all set , and I was n't . I failed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't your fault . " " What do you know about it ? You were n't there . " Miss Nachtigal was concerned . She sat down in the morocco chair without answering . " I 'm sorry . I 'm in a rotten temper . Do n't mind me. " lie walked up and down the length of the room , talking . " I had my heart set on it , " he said . " I 've told Behrens , Proctor , a dozen others it was going through . But it is n't . Their board would n't see it . Damn hard-shells . They ought to have seen it . They ca n't beat the Bertolotti process . I was n't up to myself , I never got going . I do n't know ? I thought I knew how to get my own way  --  but I do n't know . Look at you and me . I walked back from McGovern 's office  --  I almost got run over a couple of times  --  but I did a lot of thinking . Something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like opening the door and letting the light in . It is n't the money ; I do n't care about the money . But it makes you take stock of yourself . You look back at your own life . You remember how you were when you were starting out , real stuff in you , young , full of energy , ideals , potentialities . I was twenty-two , just fresh out of college , when my father started me here . You look back and wonder what the hell has become of you , what hit you , what happened to you . Yes , " he said slouching down into the chair again , his topcoat rumpling around him , " I might aswell be honest . We both know what it is . I 'm a failure , Miss Nachtigal . " He looked at her , his face tightened , the eyes hard . She stood by the corner of his desk . " You must n't talk like this . You 're upset . Do n't think about it . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's troubles . Put it out of your mind . Fine . With a man it 's different . What I need to do is nothing else but think about it , to think it through , look back at my life and think hard . What am I living for , working for , day after day ? What am I working for ? I know . To pay off a mortgage , meet insurance premiums , support stockbrokers , keep up the house , cars , servants , Mrs. Dutton and the two girls . What do those things mean to me ? The one thing I do that I really enjoy is a game of golf on a fine day , a day like to-day with spring in the air . And where was I ? Shouting at the top of my lungs up in Jack McGovern 's office . Shouting about diphenylguanidine and a million dollars . What is diphenylguanidine ? I do n't know . Nobody does . Just a word with money in it . The less you know the louder you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing but a game of golf on Sunday if it does n't rain . Yes . And look at you . I must n't forget that . " " It 's oftener than Sunday . And you enjoy your work . It 's interesting . You have ? " " I used to enjoy it . When I came to the office I was young , I worked like a dog , I went from the bottom of the ladder up in five years ; my father tried to keep me down but he could n't , I worked too hard , he had to keep moving me up ; but now I 'm at the top and I 'm dry , stale , rusted out . I hate it , the sameness , the routine , the pretense . I worked too hard and married too young . That 's the whole thing . I did n't intend to , but I 've said it . You 've met Mrs. Dutton . I do n't say anything against her . I 'm fond of her . And I love Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to dancing school together , college proms . The families were friends  --  you know how it is  --  first we got engaged and then we got married . She 's  --  she'sI 'm not going to talk against her  --  the point is  --  we 've been nothing but respectable , respectable as hell ; and I feel as though I were in prison or a treadmill barred off from everything I really want . I want you . I 've been in love with you for months and it never means anything more than an occasional word . If you only understood what you mean to me , Miss Nachtigal . You 're young . You 're of a different generation . Your generation knows better than mine . You 're not obsessed with money , with getting ahead , respectability , material things . You understand whatever it is  --  freedom , love . I know you do n't love me , but if only  --  damn it  --  the point is  --  I do n't know . You see , I want so little . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though I ought to get a little something out of them . But look at me . What am I ? Getting old , getting fat , getting stodgy . And there is n't anything I can do . What do I know that 's any use ? I do n't know how to enjoy myself , to relax , to have a good time , to be happy . I ca n't even learn . I 'm a complete failure . I ca n't learn , I ca n't change , I 'm all set inside , rusty , stuck , no good . You talk about married men . I 'm a married man . Getting married young is like getting slowly paralyzed . You ca n't make love to a woman . I do n't know how and if I did I could n't . You 're standing there , and I do n't know how to get you into my arms , how to act , what to say ; and if I knew , I could n't do it  --  it would be like breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything I say is heavy , it creaks , I ca n't move . What kind of a man is it that does n't even know how to make Love ? Lord , I 'm not a man at all . I 'm  --  I 'm  --  I do n't know  --  I ? " " Please do n't , " she said , coming quickly to him , where he sat , his head bowed . " Please do n't . I ca n't bear to hear you . " He seized her hand and kissed it . The hot tears fell on the back of her hand and he kissed them away . " Please do n't , " she repeated , holding his head against her body . When at last she withdrew her hand , he cried out , objecting , and she lifted up his head and kissed him . " Do you know what we 're going to do ? " she said . He put up his arms to pull her down upon his knee . " No . We 're going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to have dinner , we 're going to dance , and we are n't going to think about troubles . Just you and I. For this one evening . " " You 're so all-fired sweet , " he said . " Kiss me once again . Please . " " No , " she said . " I 'm too hungry . I do n't enjoy kissing on an empty stomach . And do n't begin again jabbing holes in your lovely desk with that pin . Come along . " " I feel as though I 'd been through the clothes-wringer . " Reaching behind him , underneath his topcoat , he straightened his clothes , adjusted his coat collar , and pushed at his hair and his tie . " I do n't dance any too well , " he said . June 11 When Mr. Dutton came in , Miss Nachtigal was leaning on one elbow over his great oak desk , noting telephone calls on the typewritten memorandum for the day . " Good morning , " he shouted , and hung up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Nachtigal . " " Please take your arm away , " she said , while her writing became larger and less slanting . " Certainly , I 'd oblige anyone this morning . On a morning like this I 'm clay in a woman 's hands . " " Clay ? " " All right , mud then . Mud in the hands of the potter . You may do anything with me this morning that you like , Miss Nachtigal . Anything , that is , but one  --  do n't lecture . You do n't need to lecture . I admit everything . I admit you could blackmail me for a million dollars if you were that kind of a girl  --  and I had a million dollars . I admit I 'm breaking the office rules . I admit I 'm taking advantage of my position . I admit I 'm not being fair to my wife . I admit that my children would be better fatherless than cursed with a monster such as I. Everything you 've said is true , absolutely true , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worth of difference . The only thing I can think about when I see you bending over my desk is to wonder how in the world it is that you always get the seams up the back of your stockings straight . It 's a miracle . " " The seams in my stockings are n't going to decide what you 'll say to Mr. Reverdy when he gets here at ten-fifteen . " " Shush , " he said lightly , " they 'll be bearing you through the transom . Here . " In two steps , with a rush , be kissed her mouth , her two closed eyelids , and the part in her hair . She submitted impassively . " Damn it , " he said , " if you do n't respond , at least by the shaking of a nostril , I 'll tear you into bits one of these mornings . " " I 'm afraid they might hear me tearing , through the transom . " " If anyone around here eavesdrops on anything he  --  or she  --  should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing . " I 'm on the top of the world , " hesaid , picking up one of her pencils from the desk and waving it gently . " Except for you . If only you would be nice to me . I do n't ask much . Nice to me , just occasionally , say once every blue moon . It 's months since that evening we went dancing together . Are n't we ever going again ? " " That was a mistake . " " Nonsense . " " It changed you . You lost all your boyishness , or whatever it was , that made you  --  not very much , but a little  --  appealing . " " I get frightened when I see that dead-in-earnest look gathering in your eyes . Surely you are n't going to be serious on a morning as glorious as this one . Oh , what is so rare ' and so forth . " " Are you afraid of being serious ? " " Of course not . But whatever have I done to deserve it this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little nicer . " " You did a trifle more than suggest . It is n't polite to have forgotten that bear hug so quickly . Do n't you remember ? " " But I 've done that before . " " Yes . That is n't what I object to so much . You wo n't take any responsibility for your actions . You never question yourself . You 're spoiled  - -  thoroughly spoiled . " " What is there to question ? What is there ? After all , I ca n't any more resist wanting to kiss you than I can fly. , , " Why ca n't you resist ? You 're a grown man . " He contradicted her , grinning . " No , / ca n't . " " You 're drifting straight into a mess and you wo n't lift a finger to stop it . " " That 's the first hopeful word I 've heard . A mess . Fine ! I 've been worried that I was n't getting anywhere . " " There you have it . I carry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really mind your running after me . In a way , I like it .

It 's a load . " " What are you driving at , anyway ? " " We might do some clear thinking once in a while . It might simplify matters again . For instance , what do you mean by being ' nice ' ? " " Well , that I can answer . You know as well as I do . It means  --  well-dining , dancing , having a good time together . It means  --  well  --  you know ? it 's going on in the office all the time ? Mr. Proctor and Miss Cummerford , Mr. Guernsey and Miss what's-her-name The pencil had become slippery with perspiration . It slipped out of his fingers and fell on the floor . " If you do n't finish your sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not trying to hurt you . I 'm trying to get you to think this thing through . You say you love me . Are you planning to give up your girls , divorce your wife , set half of Long Island to talking about you by causing a scan-dal ? " Mr. Dutton smiled . " Are you proposing to me , Miss Nachtigal ? " She flushed , her eyebrows pinched firmly together , abruptly she walked over to the window . To her back he said hastily , " I only want us to he friends . " " Are Mr. Proctor and Miss Cummerford friends ? " " You make everything sound so  --  so sordid . It is n't at all . I only want ? I  --  Fin not suggesting anything  --  anything improper . What I mean is ? " " Mr. Dutton , I 'm engaged to be married . " The breath went from his body . About his wrinkled eyes the skin tautened . He moistened his lips . " What are you saying ? " He strode at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ago about your proposing to me ? What are you saying ? " She took a step away from him backward against the wall between the windows . " It 's true . I 've been engaged for a long time . " " But you never told me . You never let on . You do n't wear a ring . You do n't act  --  engaged . " " I do n't know what you mean by not acting engaged . I never encouraged you . I never encouraged you a particle . As your secretary I put up with some things as part of my job but I never encouraged you in them . That is what you have been complaining about . I tried to be as decent to you as I could . I tried to respect your feelings . A moment ago , when I lost my temper , I was n't trying to hurt you . I 'm sorry for you , Mr. Dutton . I feel a kind of responsibility toward you , I  --  I ? that is n't exactly how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've said it . Go on . " " This is how it was . When I first became engaged you would n't have been interested  --  and since , as matters went along getting more and more involved , I did n't feel called upon to tell you because  --  you wo n't understand this  --  I could handle the situation without telling you . I do n't want to be let alone , respected , because I 'm engaged . I can look after my own self without dragging David into it . It had nothing to do with David and me at all . Being in love with David was my own affair . It had nothing to do with the office . I was n't called upon to discuss it with you in the slightest and , what 's more , it is n't the sort of thing I 'd want to discuss with you . Of course if you had ever wondered about me a little , instead of yourself , you would have asked me long ago whether I did n't care for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave this other out of it . I do n't suppose you 'll understand . Anyway there was n't any diamond ring because we ca n't afford one . David is just starting out . And there were practical considerations . The office does n't employ married women . Down in the stenographic room it 's generally considered poor tactics to talk about your engagement to Mrs. Abbott or any of the men . You see , I need the position . I meant to go on working after my marriage , for a few years at least . If I had to find another job it would make everything harder . There were lots of things to consider . I probably should n't have spoken now if you had n't made me angry . " " You make me feel like a cad , " he said , rubbing the palms of his hands slowly up and down on his trousers . " What an opinion you seem to have of me . I ca n't take it in . You should have warned me , stopped me . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it , Helen . You ca n't mean it . No , you ca n't . You just ca n't . You must n't .

No . " With both his hands he forced back her head . " Look at me . You understand ? " He held her face as in a vise . " I wo n't have it . You talk as if  --  everything you say  --  you ? " He threw himself against her . With one hand she clung to the window curtains while he beat upon her mouth . His lips were fierce and hard . She labored , twisting , to turn her face away . With a sharp noise , the curtain bracket snapped . The heavy silk folds sagged , swayed , and fell disorderly around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she gasped , pushing the material away and struggling out of his arms . " You 're the most tempestuous man . " Mr. Dutton was trembling . In a stride he yanked the curtain completely down , wadded it , and threw it into a chair " I wish you 'd leave me alone , " he said . " Please go . " For a long time he sat humped in his chair . Finally he picked up the pencil from the floor . With a quick movement he snapped it vindictively , once , twice , into three pieces . He walked to the window and threw the sash upward . The sun-warmed air flowed round him He thought of his body falling and held his breath , thought of his body impacting on the green copper roof with the ridge of finials eight stories below . He leaned in the window opening , threw out a part of the broken pencil , and listened . No sound came back . He heard the second bit , wind-caught , strike against the terra-cotta walls . He dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was standing behind the morocco chair when the telephone rang . Suddenly , sheepishly , he kissed the leather back of the chair . " Hello , " he said to his secretary . " Who ? No , not now . Certainly not . Before R , everdy ? ? Oh , all right . Send him in . " Miss Nachtigal came in , bringing with her the building superintendent 's helper , carrying a stepladder and a tool kit . September 26 Mr. Dutton , except for nine telephone conversations , had been dictating all morning . When he came to the last letter , he lighted a cigarette , put his feet on the desk , exhaled comfortably , and resumed in a rapid even voice . He finished the letter and abruptly , sharply , he demanded , " What have you been laughing at ? " Miss Nachtigal was surprised . " I did n't know that I had been laughing , " she said . You have been sitting there smiling to yourself at my feet , " he asserted , putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I did n't know that I was . Of course I did notice them . I 'm glad to see them back in their old place . " " That 's certainly very nice of you but do n't you think you 'd better let bygones be bygones , Miss Nachtigal ? " " I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to offend you . " " All right . Maybe I was touchy . Dictating makes me tired . But it 's strange how the past keeps popping out at us . I should have thought that after what has happened we 'd be closer together , but nothing ever seems to work out as I expect . " " I 'm afraid I 'm an unhappy reminder , " she hinted , carefully smiling . " No , it is n't that . Although I will admit that everything has n't been easy . There have been times when I felt that matters would be simplified if you were as ugly as sin , had a hump too , and neither of us had memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Dutton , is another secretary , a lovely young blonde thing , who would be extremely " ? she emphasized the word ? " nice . " Mr. Dutton leaned back in his chair rumbling with laughter . " No , thank you . No more trouble . Above all , no blondes . I prefer brunettes . " He started to put his feet back on the desk but stopped . " With the help of your mirror , Miss Nachtigal , you ought to be able to draw a very good specification of my requirements . But I am surprised . I thought you were a friend of Mrs. Dutton . " " No , " she said . " I 'm a friend of yours . I 'm resigning . " " What ? " he cried . " What ? " " It is n't a sudden decision . I 've known that something was wrong for quite a while . Now I 've made up my mind . " " I wo n't hear of it . You have no reason  --  no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . Some of them were apparent this morning . I 've been sounding you out . You do n't want me around . I make you feel uncomfortable . You see , you 've always had a way , Mr. Dutton , of letting me know what you wanted long before you were able to name it to yourself . You want me to go . " Mr. Dutton 's hands lying on the arms of his chair contracted and slowly curled into fists . " If I understand what you 're driving at , " he said , " you 're accusing me of wanting to get rid of you so I can get another secretary . That 's a nasty charge and entirely unjustified . I do n't want adventures . I do n't want anything except to forget this whole unfortunate affair . I was seriously at fault in that , I admit , but I 've behaved myself since , and the matter should be allowed to drop if only you would let it . You 're too damned clever altogether . You led me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get some kind of satisfaction , revenge , or something , out of reminding me of it , taunting me . That 's all I see in it . You 're too  --  I 'm willing to stand criticism as well as the next man but you 're too  --  well , the point is , we do n't seem to be able to get back on the old footing . " " I 'm sorry you feel this way . " " I do n't feel any way , " he contradicted , " but you 've raised this issue . I never would have done so . Now it 's up , we might as well face it . If you want to resign , you may . But as some of the responsibility has been mine , I 'm going to compensate you for losing the position . " " No , thank you , Mr. Dutton . This is not a matter for compensation . I will not accept more than two weeks ' salary . " " Oh , yes , you will , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his checkbook . " I 'm going to have a clean conscience in this . You and your young man can get married on it . " They argued for a long time . After she had left the room he continued to smoke thoughtfully . He reviewed in his mind what she had said concerning him and he decided firmly , lighting another cigarette , that she was wrong . He would not even take part in the choice of her successor . That was up to Mrs. Abbott . He put out his hand to the telephone to call Mrs. Abbott , but stopped . It could wait until to-morrow . Shaking his head , he returned his checkbook to the desk drawer and locked the drawer . From where she had thrown it , he picked up and smoothed out the crumpled check to Miss Helen Nachtigal for one thousand dollars . He stared at it for a long time . He put the check in the ash-tray and burned it , watching the paper writhe and blacken against her name , and with a pencil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHALLENGE BY GRANVILLE PAUL SMITH WHO shall rebuke me that I still must sing Amid the shattering of the testing time ? Even though I hear the vast , avenging wing Beating the dusk above the belfry 's chime ; Even though I see the lean form of despair Turn from the bread line to the bitter night , Roofless and hearthless in the lethal air , Loin of the hope that guides the gander 's flight . Let me be broken on starvation 's wheel , Aye , let me share the universal dearth , If so my voice be raised like glittering steel To shake a few bright , burning stars to earth  --  Great God , are we so futile that we die Without a challenge brandished in the sky !
