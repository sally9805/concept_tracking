" I could swing it from side to side as I pleased , quickly in short jerks or slowly and largely , and its motion seemed always to have a mysterious correspondence with whatever I desired and undertook . " Whenever , across the street , the pageant of a funeral procession wound its way up to the cemetery on the hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wailing , the child was filled with glee . " I used to sing , whistle , and yell as loud as I could , letting the bead swing as far as it would go . " <P> Of his granduncle Georg , who had once been a conjurer , he lived in thrilling awe .
