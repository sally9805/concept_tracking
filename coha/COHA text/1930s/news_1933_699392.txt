txt Religion of Foundlings . To the Editor of The New York Times : In a recent issue of THE TIMES the statement appeared in connection with the leaving of a baby girl at a Brooklyn home that the Department of Public Welfare 's system distributes foundlings under a rotation plan , the city declaring the foundling to be Protestant , Catholic or Jew in turn , depending on the order in which babies are brought to the department . That is nOt the case , though the suggestion has upon several occa- ' sions been made by me in connection with the work of the child adoption committee of the Free Synagogue , that such plan or system should be followed . In any event , wherever possible , every effort should be made by the department to place a Jewish foundling in a Jewish home , a Protestant foundling in a Protestant home , and a Catholic foundling in a Catholic home . This of course must be done under the law , but in case of foundlings difficult to identify the division of such foundlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children being allocated to Jewish institutions .
