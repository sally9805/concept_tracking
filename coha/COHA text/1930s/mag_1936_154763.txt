Upon new King George called last week " The Next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , " as many call hawk-nosed , hawk-minded Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain . Meanwhile a bona fide offer of $1,000,000 to go to Hollywood had been cabled to the Duke of Windsor &; Mrs. Simpson ( see p. 31 ) and , however remote acceptance was from their minds , it behooved the United Kingdom not to be niggardly with the Duke . At 5% , the interest on $1,000,000 is $50,000 per year and the Chancellor of the Exchequer was presently reported to have agreed with King George last week that Parliament be asked to vote $125,000 annually to maintain the Duke and problematic Duchess of Windsor . There was no thought of maintaining them in the style to which Mrs. Simpson has become accustomed in the last few months , though she will doubtless receive for Christmas the $25,000 ermine wrap now being completed in Oxford Street . <P> The question whether some of the many " distinguished Americans " going to the Coronation next May should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new King George in Buckingham Palace also arose last week . The late King George had no personal friends of U. S. nationality . As a rule , in the case of " Americans , " he gave audience only to Morgan partners . In the last year of his reign , excepting U. S. diplomats on official missions , George V audienced just two " Americans , " Morgan Partner Morgan and Morgan Partner Lamont . King Edward VIII , again excepting U. S. diplomats , accorded audience during his reign to no U. S. citizen- an amazing fact , revealing the grip which permanent Court functionaries maintained over even an extremely pro-American King . <P> At Marlborough House last week a secretary to H. M. Queen Mary , the Queen Mother , appeared horrified at the question , " Who are Her Majesty 's American friends ? " He replied , " I can not answer that question . I believe Her Majesty is acquainted with Mrs. Andrew Carnegie . " Significantly not mentioned were Mr. &; Mrs. Henry Ford , once asked by Viscountess Astor to tea at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Mary also came for tea ( TIME , April 23 , 1928 ) . Mr. Ford was , however , twice " commanded " to audience with Edward of Wales , as a special favor before Edward came to the throne . <P> The issue was up before His Majesty 's Government last week because nearly every London newspaper has editorially let slip during the recent crisis its fears that when the next war comes U. S. citizens may have a slogan as important as " Remember the Maine ! " - namely , " Remember Mrs. Simpson ! " - and be disinclined to rush overseas a second time to help the " Mother Country " fight . Not in the least far-fetched in the United Kingdom today , this authentic fear was giving serious concern in Whitehall . In 1936 thus far Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin has received at No. 10 Downing St. no U. S. citizen of however great distinction , excepting diplomats , and to a member of his own Cabinet who attempted to introduce an American he replied .
