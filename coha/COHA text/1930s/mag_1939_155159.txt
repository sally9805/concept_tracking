S. airlines , 35-year-old Jack Frye of Transcontinental &; Western Air and his 43-year-old executive vice president Paul Ernest Richter , are tough , practical airlines pilots . Burly Jack Frye bats up &; down the line through all kinds of weather in his Northrop Gamma , usually testing new equipment as he flies . Wiry Paul Richter regularly gets into a captain 's grey uniform and shoves a passenger-laden DC-3 over a scheduled run . <P> About the technical operation of well-run TWA , Frye and Richter today have few worries as they fly the line from San Francisco to Newark . But they never look at the instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card a sharp reminder of a TWA deficiency : all its routes run east and west . For TWA is , more strictly than its two coast-to-coast competitors ( United and American ) , a transcontinental line , a long thin line with no feeders to bring in side traffic . <P> Last week Jack Frye , worried about his growing waistline , announced a deal that will fatten his airline : the purchase for $350,000 of Marquette Airlines which ( when Civil Aeronautics Authority approves ) will give TWA a closely knit 565-mile feeder system in the heart of rich midwest traffic territory . <P> Marquette was organized little more than a year ago , by another executive with an airline pilot 's ticket in his pocket : convivial , pianoplaying , 33-year-old Winston Weidner Kratz . He ran it on a shoestring for months with outdated Stinson tri-motors . The line was a natural . From a TWA connection at St. Louis it ran to Cincinnati , crossed TWA again at Dayton , and continued north to Toledo and Detroit . But until CAA gave it a certificate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no sales value . Loudest to shout against a certificate for Marquette was naturally Jack Frye 's TWA which wanted no newcomer in the field it hoped eventually to develop . When it was granted TWA lost no time in demanding a rehearing from the CAA . <P> That was the beginning of a deal . While the airlines ' lawyers were arguing before the CAA , opponents Frye and Kratz went hangar-flying over drinks in a nearby bar , became fast friends . A few weeks ago they met again on a New Mexico dude ranch at a meeting of Conquistadores del Cielo ( Conquerors of the Sky ) , an airline executives ' organization for making hoopla in ten-gallon hats and hair pants ( see cut ) . Over the poker table where they played with steady hand for fat stakes , and on horseback trips where they rode for saddle-galls , the deal was made . The sale was for cash , in which Marquette 's chief financial backer , Pittsburgh Capitalist John McKelvy , will have the chief share .
