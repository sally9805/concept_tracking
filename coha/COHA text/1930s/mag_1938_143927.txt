Abner Doubleday was a general in the Civil War . The world will probably little note nor long remember what he did at Gettysburg* but it can never forget what he did at Cooperstown . In that sleepy little New York village 99 years ago , he invented baseball . <P> It was not until 1907 , 14 years after General Doubleday 's death , that a research committee definitely established Cooperstown as the birthplace of baseball . Civic-proud Cooperstownians , whose pastoral background had already been immortalized as the home town and nameplace+ of James Fenimore Cooper , bought the original baseball field , spent $25,000 to transform it into a modern ball park and public playground , named it Doubleday field . Three years ago , in anticipation of the 100th birthday of the game , baseball bigwigs and benefactors joined hands to make Cooperstown a bigger , better shrine . To preserve its treasures , baseball sentimentalists decided to build an imposing three-story colonial brick museum . To immortalize its heroes , baseball administrators voted to establish therein a Baseball Hall of Fame - to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition hall . Last week the Baseball Writers Association of America , in its third annual election , chose Grover Cleveland Alexander to join the 13 Immortals** already selected . <P> There are two ways to become an Immortal : 1 ) election by a 75% vote of the members of the Baseball Writers Association , who have been given the task of choosing players whose careers ended some time between 1900 and the year of election ; 2 ) selection by a committee of oldsters , who choose 19th Century heroes . In this year 's ballot , Grover Cleveland Alexander was the only player who received enough votes to qualify . Of 262 votes he received 212 . <P> Immortal No. 14 , whose career , like most baseballers ' , has been a poignant illustration of the old baseball adage-a hero in the third inning may look like a bum in the seventh-was last week swapping tales with local barflies in the Empire Hotel at Springfield , Ill. , when he was informed of his fortunate rescue from obscurity . One of the most effective right-handed pitchers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Alexander , now 50 , could review a career that reached its third inning in the 1926 World Series ( between the Cardinals and Yankees ) when , after a night of carousing in celebration of two victories for the Cardinals , he was called from the bullpen at the crucial point of the crucial game to pitch to Tony Lazzeri , with the bases full of Yankees . Lazzeri struck out . Alexander was the hero of the year . When , four years later , he stepped out of major-league baseball , sportswriters extolled Pitcher Alexander 's 20 years of major-league play , his National League record of 373 victories in 696 games , his 90 shutouts , 16 in one season ( an all-time record ) , his 28 victories in his first year of big-league baseball ( 1911 ) . But last week " Old Pete " was managing a hotel ball team called the Springfield Empires-a station he had reached via the characteristic twilight trail from major-league to minor-league to semi-pro baseball , including an interval of barnstorming with the bearded House of David troupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops on the first day of the battle .
