Swinging off special trains , stooping out of special airliners , squinting at California highway signs , nearly 4,000 U. S. bankers merged into San Francisco last week for the 62nd annual convention of the American Bankers Association . In their baggage were golf bags and tail coats . In their heads were vivid memories of the 1934 convention in Washington , when Jackson Eli Reynolds of Manhattan 's First National Bank swayed them by eloquence and earnestness into a truce with Franklin D. Roosevelt . And on their collective conscience was last year 's meeting in New Orleans , where they had broken that truce by damning the New Deal until they were hoarse . But they had not circulated long at convention headquarters in the St. Francis Hotel before they knew that 1936 was another truce year . <P> Early comers had been spooked by the knowledge that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Marriner Stoddard Eccles , Comptroller of the Currency James Francis Thaddeus O'Connor , and RFChairman Jesse Holman Jones , still convalescent after his air-crash shake-up three months ago , were all in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address the convention but rumor had it that his colleagues represented a New Deal concentration for pressure purposes . It was a false alarm . Mr. Eccles disappeared in the general direction of home at Ogden , Utah . Mr. O'Connor merely issued cheery figures on California banking and equally cheery denials of an engagement to Cinemactress Elissa Landi . At the last minute Mr. Jones packed off for Washington , pleading that he was still too " shaky on his pins " to make his speech . In parting he rumbled genially : " It has been a pleasure to work with the bankers during the trying period from which happily we have emerged . . . . " <P> Left to play in their own backyard , the bankers followed a program carefully planned to keep political rancor out of hearing , focus attention on professional problems . For U. S. Banking , shifted off its old base by Depression and the New Deal , they considered reorientation . Most of the speakers at A. B. A. 's general sessions were businessmen , not bankers , invited to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the convention , A. B. A. President Robert Vedder Fleming of Washington 's Riggs Bank had stopped off in Spokane , Wash , long enough to get himself named " Chief Black Hawk " by the Flathead Indians . This warlike title he bore gracefully . Mr. Fleming , amiable and solid as he is jolly , reminded the bankers that during the year Congress and the Administration had given A. B. A. " courteous and attentive consideration . " Banks had been excluded from the provisions of the law taxing undistributed earnings . " Splendid cooperation " had been received from the Government in a survey aimed at ending " competition between banks and government lending agencies . " <P> " With regard to expenditures which have caused deficit financing , " the Washington banker observed . " I think every fair-minded man recognizes that in times of national emergencies . . . the Federal Government of necessity , by virtue of its duty to the people of the nation , must undertake steps involving unusual expenditure of funds . . . .
