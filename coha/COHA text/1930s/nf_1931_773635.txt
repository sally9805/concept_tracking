txt // feel surprised that there is little or no oxygen left in the atmosphere of Venus ; what would be surprising , if we did not know the explanation , is that there is so much left in the atmosphere of the earth . The explanation is that every tree and every blade of grass on earth is a sort of oxygen factory ; the earth 's vegetation keeps up the supply of oxygen . The circumstance that no appreciable amount of oxygen can be detected in the atmosphere of Venus goes far to suggest that there is no vegetation on Venus , and so probably no life of any kind . THE OUTER PLANETS Mercury and Venus are so near to the sun in space that we always see them near to the sun in the sky . The six planets which we have not yet discussed move round the sun in circles which lie beyond the orbit of the earth . As we look out at these other planets from our position near the sun , they appear to journey not only round and round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we frequently see them in directions right away from the sun in the dark night sky . Under these conditions , the two planets which lie nearest the earth , Mars and Jupiter , can both form imposing objects ? indeed , at their best either of them may be the brightest object in the whole of the sky . They are only about a tenth as bright as Venus , but Venus is a lamp which burns mainly in daylight or twilight , while Mars and Jupiter are candles which burn in the darkness of the night ; they do not have to compete with the fierce light of the sun . All the other planets are far fainter than these . Saturn , the brightest of them , only looks like a very ordinary star . Uranus can just be seen by the unaided eye , but Neptune is well below the limits of visibility , and Pluto is enorTHE // mously below ; we need quite a powerful telescope to see Pluto . Mars , which comes first as we recede outwards into space , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more than half of the diameter of the earth . Thus Mars temporarily breaks the rule that the planets increase in size as we recede from the sun . But Jupiter , which comes next , restores it in full force . It has nearly eleven times the earth 's diameter , and 317 times its weight ; indeed it has more than double the weight of all the other eight planets rolled into one . As it is the middle one of the series of planets , fifth out of nine , it must have been born out of the middle part of the cigarshaped filament , where the matter was richest . This fits in with its being the largest and most massive of all the planets . Beyond Jupiter , both the sizes and weights of the planets steadily decline ; we have passed the middle of the cigar , and are approaching its thin end . Saturn , which comes next in order , contains less than a third of the substance of Jupiter , while the other three planets are enormously smaller than Saturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigar , appears to be hardly larger than Mercury . THE CLIMATES OF THE PLANETS A telescope is primarily an instrument for collecting a great amount of light from a star , or a group of stars , and sending it all into a man 's eye or onto a photographic plate ? just as an ear-trumpet collects a great amount of sound , and sends it into a deaf man 's ear . A telescope also collects a great deal of heat , and instruments have been devised for measuring this heat with extreme accuracy . They are now // made so sensitive that a big telescope could measure the heat sent out by a single candle hundreds of miles away ; it quite easily measures the heat sent out by the nearer planets and the brighter stars . Broadly speaking it is found that the planets send out just about as much heat as they receive from the sun , and no more . We have long known that they shine only by reflected light ? in other words that the light they emit is merely the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the same proves to be true of their heat . When they first came into being as flecks of fiery spray thrown off from the sun , they must have been intensely hot , and must have sent out fierce heat of their own , but 2000 million years have intervened since then , and have given them ample time to cool down . They no longer have any heat of their own , and are warm only in so far as they are warmed by the sun . As a consequence , the further they are from the sun , the colder they are ? like campers sitting round a camp-fire . Indeed , we may think of the sun and stars as a vast collection of camp-fires scattered through space . Out in the remote depths of space , far away from these fires , the cold is intense ? about 480 degrees of frost . As we move inwards towards the sun , or of course any other camp-fire , we come to more genial temperatures , but we have to move in a long way before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as comfortable ? or , indeed , on which life can be possible at all . The outer planets , Pluto , Neptune , Uranus and Saturn , must be colder than anything we ever experience on earth . Even Jupiter is almost unimaginably cold . The amount of heat we receive from it shews that its temperature must // be about 270 degrees below zero on the Fahrenheit scale . This is so cold that not only would water be frozen , but the commonest gases , like those of our own atmosphere , would be turned into liquids . Yet the planet is not altogether devoid of activity ; definite features appear in its atmosphere which persist for a time , and then disappear much as rain-clouds do in the atmosphere of the earth ( see Plate XXII , p. 57 ) . The clouds of Jupiter must presumably be clouds of carbondioxide , or of some other gas which only condenses at very low temperatures . When we come to Mars , the planet next to the earth , we encounter less inhospitable conditions , yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A spot on its equator at noon , with the sun beating right down from immediately overhead , is probably about as warm as London on a November afternoon . But , as we know , Mars has very little of an atmosphere to retain this heat . Also the quality of the light it sends us suggests that its surface , like that of the moon , consists mainly of volcanic ash , which again has no power of storing heat . Thus , as the sun moves on and night approaches , the temperature falls very rapidly ; frost sets in before evening , and by midnight it must be about as cold on the equator of Mars as it is at our North Pole . Our earth is at what may be described as a comfortable temperature , but as we pass on , and move still nearer to the sun , we find that the two inner planets , Venus and Mercury , are not , Venus being distinctly too warm for comfort , and Mercury very much so . A " place in the sun " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a grill over a hot fire . // IS THERE LIFE ON MARS ? Thus the earth is the only planet whose temperature seems entirely suited to life of the kind we know . Its most serious competitor is its chilly neighbour Mars . Many astronomers have seen markings on Mars , which they describe as canals , and believe to have been artificially constructed . On the other hand , photographs of the planet give no indication that intelligent beings have left their marks on its surface . The evidence for the existence of such marks has so far rested almost entirely on direct visual observation , and the human eye is notoriously capricious and unreliable when it is forced to work with inadequate light . Various experiments have proved that the eye which is struggling to study outlines in faint light tends to connect up the light and dark patches on a dimly lighted object by nonexistent straight lines , like those which the early observers of Mars believed they saw on the planet . It is in keeping with this that early observers claimed to see very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the visible surface of Venus consists only of clouds , and Mercury is obviously unsuited for life . At a still earlier period , observers used to put markings of similar type on their charts of the moon ; some of these are known to be wholly imaginary , while others , which really exist , are certainly not canals . The general life-history of such markings appears to be that they are originally put into drawings made with inadequate light and inadequate magnifying power , and subsequently disappear in the light of fuller knowledge . In view of all this , most scientists will suspend judgment on the supposed evidences of life on Mars until the camera confirms that they really exist . // There is , however , no question that certain seasonal changes are observed on Mars . During the planet 's winter a white snow cap undoubtedly forms round the North Pole . In summer this melts and , as it does so , the country further south changes its appearance . Some astronomers think these changes may be caused by the growth of vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others it seems more likely that they are caused by rain falling and watering a lifeless desert of volcanic ash . On the whole , the case for life existing on Mars , or on any other planet in the solar system , can hardly be called a strong one , and , although there is still room for much difference of opinion , it seems to me most likely that the life which exists on our earth is the only life in the sun 's family , although other stars far out in space may include inhabited planets in their families . THE SATELLITES OF THE PLANETS Most of the planets are accompanied by retinues of satellites , or moons , proportional in number to the size and dignity of the planet . The two largest planets , Jupiter and Saturn , each have nine ; Uranus , which comes next in size , has four , while the still smaller planets have two , one , or even none at all . We believe the satellites to be fragments which were torn out of the planets , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by much the same sequence of events . For mathematical theory shews that there is what may be a danger-zone surrounding every big body in space . A small body enters this danger-zone as soon // as it comes within a certain calculable distance of the big body . And , when it does so , the gravitational pull of the large body proves too much for it and tears it to pieces . No small body can enter the danger-zone of a big body and come out entirely whole , although the amount of damage done will depend on the length of stay inside the danger-zone . We believe that , long ago , in its blind wanderings through space , the sun entered the danger-zone of a bigger and more massive star , and paid the usual penalty of being broken up in the way already described ( see p. 41 , above ) . Matter was torn out of it , forming a cigar-shaped filament , out of which the planets were born . We have seen how these planets would not at first describe the regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be far more erratic , and might take them into the danger-zone surrounding the sun , in which case they would be broken up much as their parent , the sun , had been broken up before them . It seems most likely that the satellites of the planets were born in this way . Indeed , the satellite systems are so much like tiny replicas of the main solar system that we are almost compelled to suppose that they were produced by the same process as the main system . If so , the sun is the parent of the planets , and the grandparent of their satellites . SATURN 'S RINGS Saturn is in many ways the most interesting of all the planets , and is certainly the most sensational in appearance . It not only has nine moons , but also is surrounded by three flat circular rings , which form a sort of frill or collar round its middle ( see Plate // XXI ) . Galileo first discovered these in 1610 , and many speculations were made as to their true nature . In 1750 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view Saturn through a telescope capable of it , we should find his rings no other than an infinite number of lesser planets , inferior to those we call his satellites . " The truth of this conjecture has been proved up to the hilt . In 1859 , Maxwell , the Cambridge mathematician , who described the rings as " from a purely scientific view , the most remarkable bodies in the heavens , " proved mathematically that they must be of the nature which Wright had conjectured . In 1895 the American astronomer Keeler clinched the matter with some observations which shewed that the substance of the rings was moving round and round the planet , but that the outer parts of the rings moved more slowly than the inner . Again , as in the solar system as a whole , we find one-way traffic with the slower traffic keeping to the outside . We could not possibly find this if the rings were solid , but we could find nothing else if they consisted of millions of miniature moons . There is every reason for thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one time formed a quite ordinary full-sized moon of Saturn . This probably entered the danger-zone of Saturn , which no small body can enter with impunity , and paid the usual penalty of being shattered into fragments . Just as we believe that in the remote past a passing star broke up the sun , and so formed its present family , or again as we believe that the sun broke up Saturn and formed its satellites , so we believe that Saturn itself broke up its nearest satellite into millions of // fragments and so formed its own system of rings ? a third generation of astronomical bodies . Yet the two processes were not entirely similar . The sun only made a temporary stay inside the dangerzone of the bigger star . It was moving through space at a good speed , and its motion carried it out of the danger-zone before it was completely broken up . So also the stay of Saturn inside the danger-zone of the sun was only temporary . The satellite of Saturn , on the other hand , was describing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger-zone of Saturn was that this circle was shrinking gradually in size . In this way it had the bad luck to get inside the danger-zone without ever being able to get out again , and so was broken into fragments . There can be little doubt that this conjecture is sound , for we can calculate the distance to which the danger-zone of Saturn extends . Saturn 's innermost satellite is just outside it , as of course it must be to remain whole , but the rings are inside . Nowhere in the solar system do we find a satellite of reasonable size revolving inside the danger-zone of its planet . Jupiter 's innermost satellite comes nearest , being very near indeed to the danger-zone of Jupiter . It seems likely that in course of time this satellite must draw ever closer in towards Jupiter , and that sometime in the not very remote future it must enter the danger-zone of the great planet and be broken up . Jupiter will then be surrounded by rings as Saturn now is . In the same way , although only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably be drawn in closer and closer to the earth , until finally it approaches too near for safety and meets the same fate . After // this the earth will have no moon , but will be surrounded by a frill of rings like Saturn . These rings will not only reflect far more of the sun 's light than our present moon does , but there will be full moonlight all night long . While this will no doubt add to the amenities of life , things will , in some respects , be less comfortable than now . For at frequent intervals , moons must crash into one another and their broken fragments fall onto the earth like huge rocks falling from the sky . THE ASTEROIDS In between Mars and Jupiter , thousands of small bodies , called " asteroids " or " minor planets , " travel round and round the sun with the usual one-way traffic of the solar system . These , too , are probably the shattered fragments of a single big body . There is an abnormally wide gap between the paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single quite ordinary planet used to revolve in this space , and met its fate by entering the danger-zone of Jupiter . COMETS AND SHOOTING-STARS The remainder of the sun 's family are quite small objects . Foremost in size and importance come the comets . These resemble the planets in travelling round and round the sun , but differ from them in mostly having very elongated paths , so that at one time a comet may be far out in the cold depths of space , and at another quite close to the sun . Comets are usually invisible until they get well into the light and heat of the sun . Then they are apt to become conspicuous , II // and even sensational , out of all proportion to their true importance . They too are broken up when they enter the danger-zone surrounding a big body such as the sun or Jupiter ; the broken fragments then form showers of stones which we call meteors . Occasionally the earth happens to pass right through one of these showers , so that some of the meteors get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a white heat by the friction of the air , and we have what is known as a meteoric display ? a shower of shootingstars . In a few cases the paths of these meteor showers coincide exactly with the former paths of vanished comets , giving a very convincing proof that the comets have been broken up into a swarm of smaller bodies . And , indeed , the whole history of the solar system is in large part one long story of big bodies being broken into smaller ones , not so much by direct collision as by gravitational forces , such as raise tides on our earth , tearing them to pieces . Most meteors are no bigger than a walnut or a pea , if as big . Generally they are small enough to be completely vaporised before they strike the earth , leaving only a bright trail of luminous dust . The end of this trail marks the spot at which they became completely dissolved into vapour , and it is usually many miles above the ground . Occasionally , however , a meteor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the air , and what is left of it strikes the earth as a meteoric stone . All parts of the earth are of course liable to bombardment by these stones , which appear to fall out of the skies . The Book of Joshua tells how " The Lord cast down great stones from heaven . " Many other falls of stones are mentioned by early writers , and great numbers of fallen meteorites // have been preserved , some of them of considerable size and weight . In Arizona there is an enormous hole , shaped like the crater of a volcano . This is believed to have been formed by the impact of a huge meteorite , as big as a mountain , in prehistoric times . No meteorite of comparable size has fallen in recent years , although a very large one fell in Siberia in 1908 , making a wind in its fall which devastated the forests for miles around ; hardly a tree was left standing in the space of 100 square miles . HOW OLD IS THE EARTH ? Certain substances which occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their composition gradually with the passage of time . By noticing how far this change has proceeded , it is possible to tell the age both of the earth itself and of the stones which fall onto it from outer space . Both the earth and the meteorites are found to have existed for about 2000 millions of years since they solidified , which seems to shew that both are the result of a cataclysmic event which occurred about this number of years ago . Even smaller bodies circulate round the sun , like planets of infinitesimal size . These include small particles and specks of dust , single atoms and even broken bits of atoms . After the sun has set , some of these particles may reflect its light , and produce the phenomenon known as the zodiacal light . Others may reflect its light when it is hidden behind the moon at an eclipse , and produce what is called the solar corona ? a sort of atmosphere of dust lighted up by the rays of the hidden sun ( see Plate XXVI ) . // Every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant planet Jupiter down to the tiniest speck of dust in the sun 's family , has its motion mapped out for it , and is controlled , by the force of gravitation which we must now discuss . CHAPTER IV WEIGHING AND MEASURING THE STARS WE have already seen how important the force of gravitation is , both to astronomy and ourselves . It keeps the moon tied . to the earth , and maps out the paths of all the planets and other members of the sun 's family ; it raises the tides in our oceans , and , we believe , raised those far greater tides in the sun which , some 2000 million years ago , brought our earth , and so ultimately ourselves , into being . Finally , it keeps us alive , by making the earth stay near the sun instead of running away into the icy depths of space . Let us try to understand a little more as to what this force is . THE FORCE OF GRAVITATION No man can lift a ton weight ; he is prevented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually call it when it acts on earth . This pulls the weight to the ground , and proves too strong for him . Again , we find it impossible to throw a cricket ball for a mile ; we are prevented by the same force , which continually pulls the ball towards the ground , and invariably succeeds in getting it down before it has travelled a mile . We can easily throw the ball out of our hands at twenty miles an hour , and if gravity did not draw it earthward , it would cover a mile every three minutes , and after a year it would be far out 63 // in space , 175,000 miles away from the earth . Actually gravity interferes with this motion by continually pulling the ball earthward . Or again , to take an example of another kind , the moon is at present moving over our heads at about 2300 miles an hour ; if it were not pulled earthwards , it would continue to move in the same direction as now with the same speed as now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , twenty million miles out in space . Instead of this , it moves round and round the earth ; its path continually curves towards the earth , like the path of the cricket ball . Sir Isaac Newton saw that this continual earthward curving of the moon 's path could only mean that the earth was continually exerting a pull on the moon . He conjectured that this pull must be similar to that which the earth exerts on objects near its surface . Tradition says this was first suggested to him by the fall of an apple in his garden . This led him to propound his famous low of gravitation , according to which every object in the universe exerts a pull on every other object , no matter how distant it may be . Of recent years Einstein has shewn that Newton 's mathematical statement of the law was not absolutely accurate . Also the pull has proved to be of a rather different nature from that conjectured by Newton ; we no longer think of it as a mere mechanical force , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our present purpose the difference between Newton and Einstein is unimportant . STUDYING GRAVITATION Scientists can study this gravitational pull in detail , both in terrestrial laboratories and in that far greater // laboratory of the skies in which Nature for ever performs experiments , on her own colossal scale , and allows us to watch the results . The more massive a body is , the greater its gravitational pull is found to be . The great bulk of the earth is so incomparably more massive than anything else we encounter in our ordinary lives that we are generally unconscious of any gravitational pull except that of the earth , and so are tempted to think of gravitation as inherent in the earth alone . Yet delicate measurements , such as can only be made in the laboratory , shew that every object exerts its own gravitational pull . As with all forces between bodies , the gravitational pull of a first body on a second is exactly equal in amount to the gravitational pull of the second body on the first . For this reason , it is perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A and B. This means either the pull of A on B , or the pull of B on A ; they are precisely the same in amount . The fall of an apple to the ground provides direct evidence of the pull of the earth on the apple , but it is less easy to obtain evidence of the exactly equal pull of the apple on the earth . A pull of this amount has a large effect on a small body such as an apple , but its effect on the huge mass of the earth is quite inappreciable . The gravitational pull between two objects is found to depend on the amounts of substance they contain , but not on the nature of their substance . For instance , the earth exerts the same pull on a ton of lead as it does on a ton of water , or on a ton of sand , or on a ton of any other substance . This is the scientific principle which underlies all ordinary commercial weighing . When the grocer weighs out a pound of tea , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a quantity of tea against the earth 's pull on a standard quantity of iron or brass in the form of a pound weight . If the pulls are the same , the amount of tea is equal to the amount of iron or brass in the weight . Two tons of substance exert exactly twice the gravitational pull of one ton , and so on . This is why the grocer can weigh out two pounds of tea by balancing its pull against the combined pulls of two separate pound weights . WEIGHING THE EARTH If , however , we move two objects further apart , the gravitational pull between them is found to decrease . We know exactly how the pull decreases with increasing distance , so that we can always allow for the effects of distance . The experimenter in the laboratory can measure the pull which a ton of lead exerts on another ton of lead at a known distance away . Knowing this , we can reckon what weight the earth must have to exert its gravitational pull on a ton of lead or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravitational pull of the earth , whether exerted on a ton weight or on a flying cricket ball or on the moon , shews that its weight is just about **29;514;TOOLONG tons . WEIGHING THE SUN Since Newton 's day , the facts of astronomy have proved , beyond all reasonable doubt , the truth of his conjecture that this force of gravitation acts throughout the whole of space ; every body pulls every other body towards it , no matter how distant it may be . Newton 's apple not only exerted its pull on the earth , but on every star in the sky , and the motion of every star // was affected by its fall . We can not move a finger without disturbing all the stars . It is through this force of gravitation that the sun controls the motions of all its vast family of planets , comets , meteors and so on , from the huge bulk of Jupiter down to the smallest speck of dust which makes its humble contribution to the zodiacal light or the solar corona . We know this because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the law of gravitation . Just as we can calculate the earth 's weight from its pull on the moon , so we can calculate the sun 's weight from the pull which it exerts on the earth or on any other planet to keep it from running off into space . All the planets agree in assuring us that the sun has 332 , - 000 times the weight of the earth ; for every ounce of substance in the earth , the sun has very nearly a ton . Because the sun has this huge weight , its gravitational pull is tremendous . On the surface of the sun , a strong man would hardly be able to lift a 7 lb. weight , and would not be able to throw a cricket ball for more than two or three yards . He could not even perform these modest feats unlesshe was made of steel ; a man of ordinary flesh and blood would simply be crushed flat under his own weight . While the sun exerts this huge gravitational pull on all the members of its family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . For instance , any planet , asteroid or comet whose path takes it near to Jupiter , is pulled conspicuously out of its course by the gravitational pull of the giant planet . Indeed it has been suggested that the two outermost moons of Jupiter may not have been born out of Jupiter at all , but may be asteroids which the huge gravitational pull of Ju THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES iter has " captured " for it ? i.e. pulled so far out of their original orbits that they have been compelled to revolve round Jupiter ever since . This seems very possible , since these two tiny moons do not move round and round the equator of Jupiter ; they cross its sky from north to south and south to north instead of from east to west . The outermost moon of Saturn and the one solitary moon of Neptune have similar motions , and it is just possible , although less likely , that either or both of these may have been captured in the same way . Even the smaller planets exert noticeable gravitational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future path of a planet or a comet must take all these pulls , small as well as big , into consideration . THE DISCOVERY OF THE OUTERMOST PLANETS A century ago Uranus was thought to be the outermost planet of the sun 's family . Astronomers had taken account of the gravitational pulls of the sun and all the other known planets , and had calculated the path it ought to follow . They found it did not keep strictly to its predicted orbit . They then began to suspect that some other , and hitherto unknown , planet must be pulling it out of its course . Two young mathematicians , an Englishman , J. C. Adams of Cambridge , and a Frenchman , U. J. J. Leverrier of Paris , set themselves the problem of discovering what and where the new planet must be , if its gravitational pull was to account for the erratic behaviour of Uranus . In due course the cause of the disturbance was found , almost exactly in the position which Adams and Leverrier had predicted . It is now known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same // situation has recurred . Even after the gravitational pull of Neptune had been allowed for , Uranus still did not keep strictly to its predicted path , and astronomers began to suspect that yet another planet , out even beyond Neptune , must be pulling it from its course . This time it was an American , Professor Percival Lowell of Flagstaff Observatory , Arizona , who calculated how the supposed new planet must move . After fifteen years ' search ? and unhappily after Lowell 's death ? the planet was discovered in March , 1930 , fairly near to where Lowell had predicted it ought to be , and moving pretty much as he had predicted it ought to move . It is the newly discovered planet Pluto , which is about forty times as far from the sun as we are ? so far out in space that its journey round the sun takes about 250 years to complete , and so far removed from the sun 's light and heat that in all probability not only all its water but also its atmosphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These two outermost planets , Neptune and Pluto , were both discovered as a result of the confidence astronomers feel in the law of gravitation , and their discovery provided a sufficient vindication for this confidence . If we are asked why we believe in the law of gravitation , perhaps the simplest answer we can give is that it enables us to discover new planets , although a more satisfying answer would be that it makes it possible to predict the motions of all the known planets . WEIGHING THE STARS So far we have only dealt with the small colony of . objects we call the solar system . Far out in depths of space ? far beyond Neptune , Pluto , and the outermost // confines of the solar system ? we see other compact colonies . They are so far away that we should not see such small objects as planets and comets , even if they existed , but we see groups of stars which do not scatter but remain close neighbours in space . It is natural to conjecture that these , like the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony which is believed to be nearest of all consists of three stars ? two fairly bright , and one very faint ( p. 89 , below ) . But there are simpler colonies even than this . The simplest type of all , which we describe as a " binary system , " consists of only two stars , each describing an orbit round the other ? like two children holding both hands and dancing round and round , or like two partners in a waltz . They move exactly as they would if they were held together by the gravitational pulls they exert on one another , like the earth and moon , or the sun and earth . Thus we conclude it is gravitation that holds them together . The astronomer , watching the motion of the two stars round one another , can calculate how big a pull they must exert on one another to keep from separating , and in this way we learn the weights of some at least of the stars . The results are interesting . Our sun proves to be of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole , the stars shew only a small range in weight ; if we compare the sun to a man of average weight , most of the weights of the stars lie between those of a boy and of a heavy man . Yet a few exceptional stars have quite exceptional weights . A colony of four stars , 27 Canis Majoris , is believed to have a total weight nearly 1000 times that of the sun , although this is not certain . An ordinary binary system , PlasMEASURING // kett 's star , is believed , this time with fair certainty , to have a total weight of more than 140 suns . But such great weights are very exceptional . It is very rare to find a star with ten times the weight of the sun , and no star yet found has as little as a tenth of the sun 's weight . Thus on the whole the stars shew only a very moderate range in weight . THE CANDLE-POWERS OF THE STARS In contrast to their uniformity of weight , the stars shew a quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most brilliant star in the whole sky , has , close by its side , a quite dim star which only sends us about a ten-thousandth part as much light as Sirius does ; it is so faint and so enshrouded in the glare of light from Sirius that it was not discovered until 1862 . It is not a case of one star looking fainter than another because it is more distant , for this little star and Sirius form a binary system of the kind I have just described ; the faint star does not move in a straight line through space , but goes round and round Sirius , shewing that it is permanently gripped by the gravitational pull of the brighter star . We can be sure , then , that the two stars must be at very nearly the same distance from us , and that the fainter star not only looks faint , but is faint ? it is of low candle-power . Even more sensational contrasts are known . The bright star Procyon has a faint companion which gives less than a hundred-thousandth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or Omicron Ceti ) also has a faint companion ( see p. 85 ) which gives only about this same tiny fraction of the light of the main star . It is , then , certainly true that " one star // differeth from another in glory , " and this not merely because one star is further away than another . Usually , however , we can not compare the intrinsic brightnesses ? the candle-powers ? of two stars unless we know their distances . Only then can we tell how far apparent differences in brightness originate in mere differences of distance , and how far they represent true intrinsic differences of power . As we know that the sun 's distance from the earth is 92,900,000 miles , we can calculate what candle-power it must have to illuminate the earth as it does from this great distance . It must give out as much light as 3,000 , - **31;545;TOOLONG candles . Sirius is more than half a million times as distant as the sun . Light reaches us in eight minutes from the sun , but takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this information before us , we can of course calculate the actual candle-power both of Sirius and of its faint companion . Sirius itself proves to be an unusually luminous star ; it has about twenty-six times the candlepower of the sun , and its power as a radiator of heat is almost on a level with its light-radiating power . If Sirius were suddenly to replace the sun , our rivers and oceans , and even the ice continents round the poles , would rapidly boil away , and life would be banished from the earth . On the other hand , the faint companion of Sirius is of very feeble luminosity , even in comparison with the sun ; it has only about a four-hundredth part of the sun 's candle-power . If this faint star were put in place of the sun , and we had no other source of light and heat , the rivers and seas , even at the hottest parts of the earth 's surface , would immediately freeze into solid ice , while our atmosphere would condense into liquid air . // Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from representing the utmost extremes we observe in the sky . The faintest star known , Wolf 359 , is at least a hundred times feebler even than the faint companion of Sirius . At the other end of the scale is a " variable " star , S Doradus ? a star , that is , whose light continually fluctuates in brightness . Its average candle-power is well over 10,000 times that of Sirius , and over 300,000 times that of our sun . When it is at its brightest , it has over 500,000 times the candle-power of the sun , so that it pours out as much radiation in a single minute as the sun does in a whole year . If the sun suddenly became as energetic as this star , its extreme heat would rapidly turn the whole earth and all objects on it , including ourselves , into vapour . If we compare the sun to a single candle , we must compare this star to an exceedingly powerful searchlight , while the faint star Wolf 359 must be compared to a very feeble glow-worm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams out uniformly from its whole vast surface , which is nearly 12,000 times as big as the surface of the earth . It is natural to wonder how large the surfaces are of the other stars , which pour out such different amounts of radiation . What , for instance , about S Doradus , when it is pouring out 500,000 times as much radiation as the sun ? Has it got 500,000 times as big a surface as the sun , or does it pour out 500,000 times as much radiation from each square yard of surface , or what ? We may set about answering this question in one of two ways ? either we may try to find out the size of // S Doradus , directly , or we may try to discover how much radiation it pours out from each square yard of its surface , and then deduce its size from the total amount of radiation it is known to emit . Unfortunately there are great difficulties in measuring the sizes of the stars directly . When we look at a planet in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , only smaller . If we could get near enough to the stars , they also would look like round discs , just as the sun does . But the sun is the only star which shews a disc of appreciable size , even in the most powerful telescopes . All the others are too far away for their discs to be observed ; we only see them as mere pin-points of light , and so can not measure their sizes directly . There are , however , two exceptions to this general statement . The most ingenious instrument used by astronomers , the " interferometer , " makes it possible to measure the actual sizes of a few of the largest stars by direct observation ? it , so to speak , magnifies the tiny star discs in a very intricate way , until they become large enough to measure . In another field , the most ingenious physical theory used by astronomers , Einstein 's theory of relativity , makes it possible to measure the sizes of the smallest stars by direct measurement . So far this method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion to Sirius . The number of stars whose size can be measured in either of these ways is , however , exceedingly small . Apart from these few , we have to approach the problem of how a star emits its energy from the other end , by trying to discover how much energy it emits from each square yard of surface . And here , happily , our way is clear . // THE COLOURS OF THE STARS To begin with , suppose that a football team is photographed , wearing its colours of red and blue . Everyone knows that the blue will come out nearly white in the photograph , while the red will come out nearly black . The reason is that the camera is very sensitive to blue and very insensitive to red , as compared with the retina of the human eye . Now we find that the camera plays similar tricks with the stars ; photograph any bit of the sky we please , and some of the stars will come out unduly bright while others will come out unduly faint . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colours . Some are bluer than the average , others are redder ; and the camera favours the blue stars and is quite unfair to the red . A conspicuous instance of this is shewn in Plate XXVIII , a photograph of part of the constellation of Orion . The faint star indicated by the arrow furthest to the left is Betelgeux , or Alpha Orionis . To our eyes , it appears the second brightest star in the constellation , and the twelfth brightest in the whole sky . Yet , because it shines with a deep red light , the camera exhibits it as a far feebler affair than the three stars of the belt . These latter look much fainter to our eyes , but as they happen to emit blue light , the camera sees them as very gorgeous stars indeed . This gives us an obvious method of discovering the colours of the stars , and it is found that the colour of a star can be told fairly accurately from the way it is treated by the camera . Other methods are available as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera . The reason why stars are of different colours is that they are at different temperatures . As the blacksmith heats up a horse-shoe , its colour gradually changes ? // first it is dull red , then vivid red , then yellow and finally almost white , and the colour gives an indication of the temperature of the iron . In the same way , when a workman wishes to estimate the heat of a factory oven , his best rough-and-ready method is to look at the colour of the light it is sending out . A faint dull plum colour goes with one temperature , dull red with another , a bright red with another , and so on . Instruments are made to give the exact temperature of the interior of an oven from an examination of its light . In precisely the same way , the astronomer can discover the temperatures of the stars . They exhibit a complete range of colours from a dull red , through yellow and white , to vivid blue and violet , and their range of temperature is correspondingly great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with temperatures of about 1400 ? Centigrade , or about 2550 degrees on the ordinary Fahrenheit scale . Yellowish stars are at least twice as hot . After these come stars like the sun , with temperatures of about 5500 ? Centigrade or 10,000 ? Fahrenheit , and so on until we come to the hottest stars of all , with temperatures of perhaps 70,000 ? Fahrenheit . The whole observed range of temperature ? from about 2550 ? to 70,000 ? Fahrenheit ? is immense , and most of it lies entirely beyond anything we know on earth . Nevertheless , we can calculate how much radiation is given out by a given area at each temperature . The results are sensational . A surface at 70,000 ? Fahrenheit emits so much energy that power for all the railways of the world could be got from less than the standing-room for a single locomotive ; each square inch of a surface at this temperature provides enough power to keep an ocean liner like the Mauretania going conMEASURING // tinuously at full speed . On the other hand , a square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coolest stars known , hardly gives out enough power to propel a rowboat . Area for area , the hotter surface emits about 300,000 times as much radiation as the cooler . Consequently , a star at the lower temperature would need to have 300,000 times as big a surface as a star at the higher temperature , if it had to discharge an equal amount of radiation . This of itself suggests that the stars must be of very different sizes . If the dull red stars are to be of reasonable candle-power , they simply have to be enormous ; their candle-power per square inch is so small . In actual fact some of these dull red stars are of quite terrific candle-power , and give out great amounts of heat as well . For instance the total radiation , light and heat added together , of the star Betelgeux , or Alpha Orionis , which we mentioned just now , is about 6000 times that of the sun . As the star is dull red in colour , it can emit nothing like as much radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface must be far more than 6000 times as big as that of the sun . If we can find the exact temperature of Betelgeux from its colour , we can calculate how much radiation pours out from each square inch of its surface , and so can discover how many square inches of surface it needs to emit its observed total radiation ? in brief we can tell how big it is . The same method is of course applicable to any other star . First , its observed temperature tells us its output of radiation per square inch . And then , if we know its total radiation , a simple division gives us the total number of square inches of its surface . We have already noticed the two ways in which the // sizes of a few stars can be measured directly . Whenever the size of a star has been measured in either of these ways , the result has come out very near to the calculated value ? the value we obtain by dividing the total radiation of the star by its radiation per square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our method of calculation . Now such calculations give very sensational results . They shew that the stars vary far more in size than in weight or temperature , and more even than in candle-power . The smallest star so far discovered , Van Maanen 's star , is hardly , if at all , greater than our earth ; a million such stars could be packed inside the sun and leave room to spare . This makes the sun seem quite a big star , yet there are other stars , such as Betelgeux , so enormous that many millions of stars of the size of the sun could be packed inside them and leave room to spare ; they are so big that if one of them were put in the position of the sun , we should find ourselves inside it , the radius of the star being greater than that of the earth 's orbit . Let us again imagine that the sun is represented by a pea , then the tiniest of stars , such as Van Maanen 's star , will be represented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely cover the dot of an " i " in this type , while the largest stars must be represented by globes as big as motor-cars . We see that the museum of the sky contains a vast range of exhibits , and we can not but wonder what is the origin and meaning of so amazing a variety . Why are the stars so much alike in their weights , and so little alike in everything else ? To this question we shall turn in our next chapter . CHAPTER V THE VARIETY OF THE STARS WE have seen how the stars shew as great a range of candle-power as there is between a glow-worm and a searchlight ; while their range of size is as that between a speck of dust and a motor-car . The range in their weights is much smaller , but still it is about equal to that between a feather and a football . And in every respect the sun is somewhere about average . It could hardly be expected to strike the exact happy mean in every way , but it never misses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less complimentary way , the sun is totally undistinguished in all respects ? in weight , in size , in temperature and in candle-power . Clearly , however , we get very little knowledge of the general nature of the stars from a mere mention of extremes and of one average star . We should not know much about the English population if we had only been told the heights and weights of the shortest dwarf and the tallest man , and that a particular man 5 feet 9 inches high was a good average Englishman in all respects . We want a more detailed knowledge as to the classification of the stars by size , candle-power and weight . Suppose that all the entrants to a dog-show broke loose and ate their labels , and had to be reclassified . A novice would probably think it necessary to classify 79 // them several times over , first by weight , then by colour of coat , then by length of coat , and so on ; the expert would at once set to work to classify them by breeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would vary substantially inside each breed , but nothing like so much as through the whole range of dogs . THREE TYPES OF STARS It is much the same with the stars . They look an exceedingly mixed lot to the casual observer , but the expert astronomer knows that they can be classified into distinct types with almost the same precision as dogs at a dog-show . Indeed there are almost innumerable breeds of dogs , but only three main types of stars , which are distinguished primarily by their sizes . We must not compare the stars to a whole dog-show broken loose , but only to three classes , one of very small , one of medium-sized , and one of immense , dogs . Of course the comparison is not perfect ; the sky is not quite so simple as this . The main respect in which it fails is that there is a gradual transition between the two largest classes , although not , so far as we know at present , between either of these and the class of very small dogs . Before trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us try to understand how they come to exist . First of all , why are there distinct types of stars at all ? Our knowledge of the structure of the atom seems to provide at least a partial answer . During our rocket-tour inside the sun , we noticed that an ordinary atom consists of a central nucleus with a number of tiny and almost weightless electrons arranged round it . At such temperatures as we experi-ff // ence on earth , the nucleus holds all its electrons in a firm grip . With greater heat , such as we found in the sun 's atmosphere , the outermost electrons begin to work loose . Finally , at the extreme heat of the sun 's centre , we found that all the electrons had worked loose except for an inner ring of two which are held in a very specially firm grip , a grip so tight that it can defy a temperature even of 40 million degrees . WHITE DWARFS Yet stars are known whose centres are ten , twenty ? perhaps even fifty ? times hotter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip its electrons strongly enough to defy such heat as this . At the centres of these stars every atom is completely broken up ; the only substance there consists of what we may call powdered atoms , a mere disordered crowd of nuclei and electrons dashing about helter-skelter in all directions without any attempt at coherence ? matter in its most rudimentary form . As we have no experience of such a state on earth , it is difficult to find a single word with which to describe it . It is like a gas in consisting of a number of tiny particles each of which moves independently of the rest . Yet the particles are jammed so closely together that perhaps we shall get a better picture if we compare the substance to a liquid such as water or quicksilver . A complete unbroken atom is like the solar system in miniature ; the massive central nucleus is the sun , ) ! and the electrons are the planets . And again , it is like the solar system in consisting mainly of empty space . We have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their distances apart . We made // a model of their arrangement by laying out a pea , two small seeds , some grains of sand , and some specks of dust in Piccadilly Circus . The whole of Piccadilly Circus was needed to represent the space of the solar system , but a child can carry the whole substance of the model in its hand . All the rest is empty space . It is the same with the atom . If we take Piccadilly Circus to represent the space occupied by the atom , its material ingredients ? the nucleus and the electrons ? will at most be a few small seeds , which again can be packed in a very tiny space . At the centres of the hottest stars of all , the tiny ingredients of the atoms are so packed . After the fierce heat has broken the atom into its constituent nucleus and electrons , the intense pressure , produced by the weight of all the rest of the star , comes into play and jams these ingredients close together . This packs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the star is of very small size . This way of packing a star 's substance gives us the smallest class of stars , the class which astronomers describe as " white dwarfs . " An extreme instance is Van Maanen 's star ( p. 78 ) , which is no larger than the earth . A less extreme example is the faint companion of Sirius ( p. 71 ) . This is about thirty times as big as the earth , but as it contains 300,000 times as much substance , it must be packed 10,000 times as closely as the earth . We see that Nature can still teach us something in the art of packing . If we could pack our terrestrial goods as closely as these stars are packed at their centres , we could carry about 100 tons of tobacco in a tobacco-pouch , and several tons of coal in each waistcoat pocket . Compared with the powdered atoms of which these stars are formed , the solid substance of our // earth is but the finest of gossamer ? a sort of spiderweb spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so compact , each bit of their minute surfaces is called on to radiate a vast amount of energy . Generally speaking , every square inch of surface gives out about 250 horse-power of energy , as against 50 horse-power per square inch for the sun . To get rid of all this energy , the star 's surface must be at a white heat . We now see why stars of this type are known as " white dwarfs " ? dwarfs because of their small size , white because they are white-hot . MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS The white-dwarf stars are rather exceptional , and the substance of most stars is not so closely packed . When we were inside the sun , we noticed that the majority of the atoms were not completely broken up ; many of their nuclei still retained one or two electrons , thus forming real atoms of a definite , although very minute , size . Such atoms can not be crammed into almost no space at all , like the substance at the centres of the white dwarfs , but they can be packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are packed in this way at the centre of the sun , so that a cubic foot of substance contains some tons ? we do not quite know how many . At the centre of a white dwarf , a cubic foot contains many thousands of tons . The sun , with its substance packed in this way , is representative of the largest class of stars , the stars of medium size , which are known as " main-sequence " stars . This class comprises perhaps 80 per cent . of all the stars in the sky . The centres of all main-sequence // stars are about as hot as the centre of the sun , with the result that the atoms usually retain their two innermost electrons and no others ? we may compare them to solar systems in which only Mercury and Venus are left describing their orbits . And although matter which is broken up to this extent can be packed very closely , it can not be packed anything like as closely as it is packed in the white dwarfs . The result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white dwarfs , and do not shew any enormous range of sizes . But apart from their sizes they shew the utmost diversity , their weights ranging through the whole gamut of known stellar weights , and their colours through the whole spectrum of known colours from the most vivid violet to the dullest red , Yet , as the name " main sequence " implies , they form a true sequence . When we arrange them in order of weight , we find that we have also arranged them very approximately in order of colour ; their heaviest stars are also their bluest , and with decreasing weight , the colour passes steadily down the spectrum , through blue , white and yellow , to the dullest and deepest of reds . And again , with decreasing weight the candlepower continually decreases , running through the whole range of stellar luminosities from the searchlight to the glow-worm . RED GIANTS Stars of the third class are distinguished by their centres being much cooler than the centres even of main-sequence stars ; the temperature may be as low as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this , the electrons are not stripped off the // atom down to the innermost ring of two , as they are in the sun . Other rings of electrons are left clinging to the nucleus , so that the atoms remain of very respectable size and can not be packed very close together . Indeed , they seem to make themselves very comfortable , retaining so much elbow-room that the stars we are now discussing are of immense size . A typical example is the star Betelgeux , or Alpha Orionis , which is 25 million times as big as the sun , although probably containing only about forty times as much substance . A still larger example is Omicron Ceti , which is so large that 30 million suns could be packed inside it . This has been recently found to have a faint companion in the shape of a white dwarf , the two together forming a binary system . If the stars had a sense of humour , this ill-assorted pair ought to create some merriment by their absurd incongruity and inequality of size . Landseer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is as though an elephant and a sandfly were to join hands and travel about through space in one another 's company . Most of these stars are big enough to hold at least a million suns in their interiors . Although their candle-power is terrific , yet they have such immense surfaces that each square inch has only a small amount of energy to dispose of ; sometimes as little as half a horse-power , as compared with 50 horse-power in the sun , and 50,000 horse-power in some blue main-sequence stars . The surface can dispose of this small amount of energy without becoming unduly hot , so that its colour is generally red or , less often , yellow . These stars may be described as red and yellow giants ? giants because of their size , and red or yellow because of their colour . // STELLAR ENERGY It seems pretty clear that the wide difference in the size of the stars is associated with a corresponding difference in the size of the atoms in the star 's interior , but we understand the wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each star must be regarded as a huge power-station , which generates energy in its interior , and pours it out into space in the form of radiation from its hot surface . The sun 's output of 50 horse-power per square inch may seem tremendous at first glance ; but we must remember that a square inch of surface is the only outlet for the energy generated in a large bulk of star . As the sun has a radius of 432,000 miles , all the energy generated in 432,000 miles of substance behind a square inch of the sun 's surface has to pour out through that square inch . When we look at it this way , 50 horsepower per square inch does not seem excessive , rather the reverse . We know that radiation has weight , so that a stream of weight must continually be pouring out of every bit of a star 's surface . Calculation shews that the total radiation which pours out from the sun every second has a weight of 4 million tons . Thus the sun must continually be losing weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is about 10,000 times the rate at which water flows under Westminster Bridge . Its weight is diminishing as surely as if there were 10,000 gashes in its surface with a whole River Thames pouring out of each . At this moment it weighs many millions of tons less than when you began reading this chapter ; by this time to-morrow it will weigh 350,000 // million tons less than now . Where does all this weight come from ? THE STARS DESTROYING THEIR SUBSTANCE We still do not know for certain how a star generates its radiation , but it seems most likely that it does it by destroying its own substance , just as an ordinary power-station generates energy by burning coal . But the process going on in the star is something very different from a mere combustion , which only involves a re-arrangement of atoms . More probably it is an actual annihilation of atoms : an atom exists at one instant , and the next it is snuffed out : nothing remains but a flash of radiation , which , however , will have precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the true origin of the radiation of the stars , the sun is destroying its atoms at the rate of 4 million tons a second , or 350,000 million tons a day , and other stars must be destroying their atoms at other , but comparable , rates proportional to their various candle-powers . Because of the weight they continually lose in the form of radiation , the stars must be continually getting lighter in weight , so that , broadly speaking , the oldest stars ought to be those of lightest weight . There is a good deal of evidence to suggest that such is actually the case . We have already seen how the stars of greatest weight , which we must now regard as the youngest , are far and away the most luminous , and generally speaking , the candle-powers of the stars fall off with diminishing weight . But they lose in candle-power far more rapidly than in weight . The old star not only has less substance left , but what is left is less efficient in // radiating power per ton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of a mixture of substances which turn themselves into radiation at different rates . Some substances transform themselves very quickly , and so give off radiation very rapidly while they last , but do not last for long . While they last the star radiates furiously . After they have been used up , the feebler kinds which are left give off radiation more slowly , and so last for much longer , so that , after a brief but boisterous youth of squandering its substance at a profligate rate , a star can look forward to a serene and protracted old age in which it radiates its energy more sedately . Although this scheme can not be said to be finally and unalterably established , it accords well enough with the known facts of astronomy , and it will at least serve to give interest to the great variety of stars observed in the sky . THE NEAREST STARS With the foregoing classification of the stars in our minds , let us briefly survey our nearest neighbours in space . These probably give us a fairly good sample of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should quite certainly get a worse sample , because we should then be ignoring great numbers of very faint stars , which are unknown and unobserved as the result of their combination of distance with faintness . It is only quite near home that we can count on very faint stars being observed . A list of our 26 nearest neighbours in space , with their distances in light-years , is given opposite . The circles which follow give ( approximately ) the relative sizes of the stars , and this is followed by their colour as seen through the earth 's atmos90 THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES phere . Finally the last column shews the approximate radiating powers of the stars , that of the sun being taken as unity . Assuming that these 26 stars are typical of the whole sky , we notice at once that the majority of stars are both redder and smaller than the sun , and so of course must also be less luminous . Probably only four of the 26 stars are larger than the sun , while only three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sirius and Procyon , are more luminous . We notice that the whole group of stars does not contain a single red or yellow giant . This does not mean that the vicinity of the sun is in any way abnormal . Giant stars are extremely rare in space , so that there are immense odds against even a single one occurring in any small collection of stars . If there had chanced to be a red or yellow giant in the vicinity of the sun , we should not have been able to exhibit it in our diagram : an average red giant would be represented by a circle 12 feet in diameter . Out of these 26 stars , 23 are certainly main-sequence stars , while one , the faint companion to Procyon , is doubtful ? it may be a white dwarf . The remaining two , the faint companion to Sirius and Van Maanen 's star , are certainly white dwarfs . Our sample is adequate to shew that the vast majority of stars in the sky belong to the main sequence . These 26 stars are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them more slowly than the sun ; only three , one in each of the systems of Alpha Centauri , Sirius and Procyon , are wasting away more rapidly than the sun , and these all have more substance to waste . The sun 's present store of atoms would last it for about 15 million million years at its present rate of consumption , but long before it comes to its last // atom , it will have reached the state of the smaller and fainter stars , and be radiating its substance away far more slowly than now . Allowing for considerations of this kind , it seems probable that most stars may look forward to lives of hundreds of millions of millions of years before darkness finally overtakes them . Whether this estimate becomes finally established or not , one thing seems certain ? our human lives fade into utter insignificance when measured against astronomical time . We have seen how the earth is only a speck in space ; we now see that our lives , and indeed the whole of human history , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we discussed the face of the sky in our first chapter , the stars were nothing to us but a distant background of points of light . This background enabled us to fix our bearings in space , and we saw how we could pick out our near neighbours , the planets and other members of the sun 's family , by their rapid motion against it . Since then we have examined what the stars really are , and have discussed their various physical characteristics . Amongst other things , we have found that they shew great variety in their candle-powers . While some are thousands of times more luminous than our sun , others are thousands of times fainter . If we compare our sun to an ordinary candle , some stars must be compared to searchlights , and some , at the other end of the scale , to glow-worms or fireflies . It has only recently been discovered how great a range there is in the candle-powers of the stars . For a long time it was supposed that the stars all had pretty much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? so that when a star looked very dim , it was only because it was very distant . In 1761 the astronomer Lambert argued that as all the stars had been made to serve the same purpose , there was no reason why some should have been made fainter than others ; 92 // if some appeared fainter it could only be that they were more distant . We have already seen how utterly and completely wrong this conclusion was . MAPPING OUT THE UNIVERSE If Lambert had been right , and all the stars had been found to have the same intrinsic brightness , like a row of street lamps , astronomy would have been a much simpler science than it is . We could at once have deduced a star 's distance from its apparent brightness , and so could have mapped out the universe star by star . As things actually are , the faint star we are looking at may be a very distant searchlight , or it may be a very near glow-worm . It is hard to say which ; we can only decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can measure the distances of some stars by the ordinary surveyors ' method , noticing how much they change their positions as we move about in space . But this only applies to a few very near stars . The longest journey Nature permits us to take is the journey of 186 million miles which we take every six months as the earth passes from one side of the sun to the other . And most of the stars are so remote that even this long journey causes no appreciable change in the directions in which we see them . ' We are in effect faced with the problem of measuring the distances of objects by merely looking at them , without being allowed to move about . How are we to do it ? We have seen how we could do it with a row of street lamps , provided we knew they were all of the same candle-power . We use the same method for the stars . As a whole , they are of widely different candlepowers , but it has recently been discovered that certain // classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a uniform standard candle-power . As soon as we know the candle-power of one , we know the candlepower of them all , and then we can use the " street-lamp " method to judge their distances ? the fainter the star looks , the more distant it is . Or , even more concisely , the star is just as distant as it appears to be . The street-lamp method would of course fail if there were any sort of fog or obscuring matter pervading space , and extinguishing light after it had travelled a certain distance . On a foggy night , we can only see a few of the very nearest lights in a street , and must not judge their distances from their apparent faintness ; the faintest are not as distant as we might think them , if we did not know that we were looking at them through a fog . Very careful investigations seem to shew that there is no such fog in space , except in a few special directions . Scattered here and there over the sky are a number of clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , or else a few whose brightness proves them to be quite near . A conspicuous instance is the jet-black patch known as the Coal Sack , which appears near the middle of Plate XXIX . These patches look like yawning cavities and used to be interpreted as such ; they were thought to be holes in the system of stars ? a system of tunnels reaching from outer space to the earth , although it must always have seemed very odd that so many tunnels should converge on our tiny earth . We now know that the black empty spaces are not tunnels at all ? they are clouds of dark matter , fairly near home , which prevent us seeing the stars beyond . A mere inspection of modern photographs is enough to establish this interpretation . For instance , the dark patch shaped like a horse 's head near the middle of // Plate XXX , can not possibly be interpreted as a tunnel through the stars ; we see at once that it is some kind of obstruction . Except in the few directions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomical space appears to be perfectly transparent . Starlight travels through it without let or hindrance and suffers no diminution except on account of distance . So that of any special classes of stars which are of uniform candlepower , it is strictly true that a star is just as distant as it appears to be . The most interesting stars of this kind are a class known as Cepheid variables . CEPHEID VARIABLES The light of most stars is perfectly steady , but there are a few rare stars whose light continually fluctuates from bright to faint and back again , as though some one were continually turning the tap of a gas-lamp up and dawn . Long ago a star , Delta Cephei , was observed to fluctuate in a very peculiar way ? as though the tap were turned down gradually , and then suddenly turned up again with a rush . It repeats this cycle of changes with the utmost regularity every 5 %3 days . A distant star-cloud , the Lesser Magellanic Cloud ( see Plate XXXI ) , contains a whole lot of stars exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all look equally bright . As they are all at the same distance , this means that they must all have the same candle-power . Other stars of precisely the same kind are found so near home that we can measure their distances by the ordinary surveyors ' method , and so can of course calculate their actual candle-powers . All these , too , are found to have the same candle-power . To sum up a whole lot of . lilt // astronomical research , it is found that every star which behaves like Delta Cephei has the same candle-power as Delta Cephei. 1 Other stars shew characteristic light-fluctuations of the same general kind ? the same gradual dimming followed by a rapid restoration of brightness ? but have periods of fluctuation different from the 5% days of Delta Cephei . All such stars , as a class , are known as Cepheid variables . Again all those which have the same time of fluctuation , whatever it is , are found to have the same candle-power , which we discover , as before , by calculating the candle-power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle-power of any Cepheid variable in the sky by noticing the time of its fluctuation , and then we can deduce its distance from its apparent brightness . These stars are like lighthouses in the vast oceans of space . We recognise them at once and unmistakably by the characteristic fluctuations of their lights , and knowing their candle-powers , we can at once deduce their distances . This gives us a most valuable method for sounding space , or at least those parts of space in which we can see Cepheid variables . Shortly after the method was discovered , the present director of Harvard Observatory , Dr. Shapley , used it to measure the distances of certain clusters of stars , known as " Globular Clusters , " each of which contains some hundreds of thousands of stars . GLOBULAR CLUSTERS Imagine a swarm of bees settling in the open air . They form a central globular mass , round the outskirts of which an enormous number of bees buzz about and 4 // form a sort of atmosphere to the main swarm . If we replace each bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation of what a globular cluster looks like ? a round mass of stars , whose members are closest together at the centre and more widely spaced on the outskirts . A typical cluster is shewn in Plate XXXII . About a hundred of these globular clusters are known . No new ones are being discovered now , or have been discovered in the last century or so , so that we may take it that there are none left to discover ; we know them all . They mostly look very faint objects in the sky , only five or six being visible to the unaided eye . They all contain great numbers of Cepheid variables , and this makes it possible to estimate their distances with considerable accuracy , and with sensational results . Even the nearest of the globular clusters proves to be so remote that its light takes about 18,400 years to reach us . We do not see it as it now is , or where it now is ; we see it where it was , and as it was , 18,400 years ago ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light which started out on its long journey to us while the earth was still covered with primaeval forest and overrun with wild beasts , while agriculture was unknown and man lived by the crudest kinds of hunting and fishing . While this light has been travelling through space on its way to us , all the recorded history of mankind has taken place ; 600 generations of man have been born , lived their lives and died ; empires have risen , decayed and fallen ? it has taken all this time for the light from even this nearest of the globular clusters to reach us , travelling through space at a rate of more than 11 million miles every minute . This cluster contains hundreds of thousands of stars , many of which are far more // luminous than the sun . And yet it is so distant that it can only be faintly seen by the unaided eye . If this cluster should contain astronomers amongst its inhabitants , who study us as we study them , they will see the earth 's yearly path round the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This shews how useless the old surveyors ' method of measuring the distances of the stars becomes at these great distances . Beings who can only crawl round a pinhead can not expect to see objects 400 miles away changing their positions by a measurable amount . Shapley further found that the most distant cluster is about ten times as remote as the nearest ; while the light from the nearest cluster takes about 18,400 years to reach us , that from the furthest takes about 185,000 years . He also measured the distances of all the intermediate clusters , and mapped out their positions in space . Their general arrangement in space proved to be rather like the arrangement of currants in an ordinary currant-bun ; in other words they are fairly uniformly distributed through a space shaped like a bun , a space of circular cross-section whose thickness is less than its length and breadth . Although this is not yet certain , it now seems likely that in mapping out the globular clusters in this way , Shapley was solving a bigger problem than was realised at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stars in space . Probably the first instinct of primitive man was to suppose that the stars went on for ever and ever . It is the simplest , and in many ways the most natural supposition to make . Yet a great many considerations shew that it can not be the correct one . To mention only one , if the stars went on for ever and ever , arTHE // ranged as they are near the sun , then , in whatever direction we looked , we should be certain to come upon a star sooner or later . The whole sky would appear as a uniform unbroken blaze of light , just as in a blizzard the whole sky appears as a uniform unbroken sheet of snow . As the greater part of the night sky is black , we may be sure that the stars do not go on for ever ; after we have gone a certain distance into space they must begin to thin out and finally disappear . Apart from the special regions already mentioned , in which star-light is blocked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black where we have looked right through the whole system of stars into the vacant space beyond . THE MILKY WAY Yet not quite all of the night sky is black . On any clear moonless night , we see a great arch of faint pearly light , spanning the sky from horizon to horizon . We can not see what happens to it below the horizon , unless we travel round the world . We then find that its two ends join up in the southern sky , so that it forms a great endless circle of light which goes round the whole sky ? a belt of light encircling the world . In nearly all languages it has the same name ? the Milky Way . Not only primitive peoples but even the early astronomers were much mystified as to the nature of this arch of light . The Mexicans called it very poetically " The little white sister of the many-coloured rainbow , " and with most civilisations it formed the subject of innumerable legends ? you may remember Tintoretto 's picture " The Origin of the Milky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Then in 1609 Galileo // turned his newly constructed telescope upon it , and the mystery was immediately solved . The Milky Way was seen to be nothing but a cloud of faint stars , scattered like a fine silvery dust on the velvety background of the sky ( see Plates XXIX , p. 94 , and XXXIII , p. 104 ) . Galileo 's telescope further shewed that , even in the Milky ' Way , the greater part of the sky is blackness , stars being only incidents on a black background . Except where there are patches of obscuring matter , this blackness can only result from our looking through the whole system of stars into the vacant space beyond , so that even in the direction of the Milky Way , we come to the end of the stars in time . Yet many more stars can be seen in this direction than in any other ; also they look fainter , which suggests that they are more distant . Clearly we can travel much further in this direction than in any other before coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE STARS Sir William Herschel reached this conclusion 12G years ago . He thought that the stars were arranged rather like an enormous cart-wheel , with the sun somewhere near the hub . He supposed that the stars in the rim of the wheel formed the Milky Way ; the stars in this direction looked faint because they were so distant , and they appeared specially numerous because , when we looked in this direction , we saw not only the stars of the rim but the stars all along the length of a spoke as well . Recent work in astronomy has confirmed Sir William Herschel 's conclusions in many respects , but shews that in one respect he was wrong : the sun is not at , or even near , the hub of the great wheel of stars , but // part way along a spoke ? perhaps something like a third of the way from hub to rim . For we now know that a this great wheel of stars is rotating in space . It is not rotating round the sun , or round a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant that light from it takes about 50,000 years to reach us . This hub lies in almost exactly the same direction as the centre of the bun in which we have imagined the system of the globular clusters to be enclosed , and is at about the same distance . Also the plane of the wheel , which is of course the plane in which the Milky Way lies , agrees exactly with the central plane of the bun ; half of the globular clusters lie on one side of the Milky Way , and half on the other . This establishes , almost beyond doubt , that Sir William Herschel 's round cart-wheel is essentially the same thing as the round bun by which we have represented the arrangement of the globular clusters in space ; the stars occupy the same region of space as the globular clusters , and as we travel out into space the two leave off more or less together . There is only one difference : the cart-wheel which represents the stars is not quite so thick as the bun which represents the globular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us butter our bun . Let us cut it into two halves , top and bottom , spread a good thick layer of butter between the two halves , and then put them back into position again . Then the butter represents the stars , and the currants the globular clusters . The sun is not , as Sir William Herschel thought , near the middle of the bun ; it is true that there is as much of the bun above it as below it , so that it comes in the middle of the layer of butter , but it is nearly half-way out from the centre to the rim . This very prosaic model is the simplest I can devise // to explain the arrangement underlying the majestic magnificence of the night sky . To pass from the model to the reality , we must magnify and magnify and magnify , until each tiny speck of space becomes millions of miles : we must replace each currant by a cluster of hundreds of thousands of stars , our layer of butter by a cloud of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the velvety blackness of empty space , or , at most , into sparsely scattered atoms , or broken fragments of atoms , and clouds of dust . If we can persuade our imaginations to make all these transformations for us , the result will be anything but prosaic ; it will provide us with a key to the most impressive spectacle which the eye of man ever beholds . It will enable us to look at the wonderful panorama of the sky with a new understanding of what it all means . THE NIGHT SKY Yet , even so , we must not expect to see the whole structure spread before our eyes when we stand in the open and look up to a clear night sky . The distances in space are so immense that even the most luminous stars only affect our unaided eyes if they happen to be comparatively near to us . Unless their light can reach us in less than about three thousand years , we shall not see them without optical aid . Now even the nearest of the globular clusters is six times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the stars we can see individually , as stars , lie in a very tiny bit of space surrounding our sun ? in a bit of our currant-bun which it itself not much larger than a good-sized currant . If every star outside this tiny bit of space were suddenly annihilated , our unaided eyes would not see a // single star disappear from view . The Milky Way would disappear , because it is formed by the combined light of a great multitude of stars which are too far away from us to be seen individually ? like the lights of a distant town . And the general background of the sky would become just a bit darker , because a faint and almost imperceptible haze of light is spread all over this by distant stars , which again are too remote to be seen individually . But our unaided eyes would discern no other changes . All the stars we see separately as stars would remain unaffected ; they are all very near home indeed , when we measure distance on the astronomical scale . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two distinct parts . First , we see the constellations , which consist of a very near foreground of separate stars ? that is to say , near on the astronomical scale . Second , we see the Milky Way , which is a background formed of stars so distant that we only see them as a crowd . Constellations and Milky Way ? these are all that we see . In the middle distance between are millions of stars which we do not see at all , because they are too distant to be seen as separate stars and too few to appear as a continuous cloud of light ; at best they merely lighten up , in small measure , the dark background of the sky . This whole system of stars , the wheel-shaped system bounded by the Milky Way as rim , is usually described as the " Galactic System . " THE NUMBER OF THE STARS If we could see all the stars of the Galactic System as separate stars , how many would there be ? At // first this may seem the simplest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely he has only to count them in his telescope . Unfortunately it is nothing like so simple as that . The larger the telescope the more stars we see . The largest telescope yet built shews about 1500 million stars ? roughly a star for each inhabitant of the earth who is more than five years old . But a still larger telescope which is now under construction will almost certainly shew many more , and even then we can not expect to see all the stars , or anything like all . No ; it is no use trying to count the stars ? there is only one way of telling their total number , and that is to weigh them all together . It may sound crazy to talk of weighing stars we can not even see , but this describes quite literally what astronomers have recently been doing . For a long time there was some doubt as to how the system of stars was able to retain its shape of a disc or a wheel . It was hard to see why the gravitational pull of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars of the rim until they all fell together in a bunch at the centre . This puzzle is now solved ; the wheel retains its shape simply because it is revolving round the hub . In this it is rather like the solar system , but on a stupendous scale . The solar system is also shaped like a disc or a wheel . There is no mystery as to why it retains this shape ; it is because the planets are revolving round the sun . They would fall in if they stopped revolving ; actually their motion round the sun saves them from this fate . The planets which are nearest the sun have to move fastest , because the sun 's gravitational pull against which they have to contend is strongest where they are . It is the same in the far larger system of stars : their motion saves them from falling into the hub . The gravitational pull is strongest near the // hub , so that the stars which are nearest the hub move fastest . The sun , at some distance from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is 10,000 times the speed of an express train . And its distance from the hub is so great that , even moving at this speed , its journey round the hub probably takes two or three hundred millions of years . These figures are not at all exact ; we still do not know with any accuracy how far we are from the hub round which we are turning . We have a far better knowledge of the direction in which this hub lies . It must of course lie in the Milky Way , and is almost certainly in the stretch shewn in Plate XXXIII . Probably it is somewhere near the middle of it . Now the middle of this stretch has long been known as the richest part of the Milky Way . We should expect the stars to cluster most thickly round the hub of the wheel , and in any case we should see the greatest depth of stars by looking in the direction of the hub to the rim beyond , so that it is not surprising that the hub should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way . The richest part of all is the Great Star Cloud in Sagittarius . This lies close to the centre of Plate XXXIII , and is shewn in greater detail on Plate XXXIV . A great number of very varied investigations combine to assure us , with remarkable unanimity , that the hub of the great wheel lies somewhere in or near this star-cloud . In all probability , it lies behind the patch of dark obscuring matter which occupies the righthand half of the plate . If so , we shall never see the hub round which the great wheel turns . We can picture the motion of the stars most simply if we think of the path of every star as being continually curved in towards the hub of the wheel by the 0 // gravitational pull of some huge central sun . Yet it is highly improbable that any such central sun exists . If we could see through the dark clouds of obscuring matter , we should probably see nothing more than a fairly dense crowd of ordinary stars . It is most likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the two components of a binary system , and are not controlled by a single big central mass . As soon as we know the speeds with which the stars move round the hub , we can weigh the system of stars , just as we could weigh the sun when we knew how the planets moved round it . Each star is under the pull , not only of the stars in the hub , but of the whole system of stars , so that we can find the weight not merely of the hub but of the whole cart-wheel . And as we know that the average star has about the same weight as the sun , or perhaps somewhat less , we can say how many stars go to make up the cart-wheel . Needless to say , we can not tell the number with great accuracy . It is almost certainly greater than 100,000 million ; that is to say , there are almost certainly more than 60 stars for each man , woman and child living on earth . It may well be twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . It is not easy to realise what such numbers mean . First of all , how many stars can we see on a perfectly clear night , without a telescope at all , using only our own eyes ? They look a vast multitude , and most people , if asked to guess , will say a hundred thousand , or twenty million , or some such number . But actually the very best eyesight can only see about 3000 ? rather more than the number of letters of type on two pages of this book . // Now imagine every one of the 3000 stars we can see to spread out into a whole new sky-full of stars . Even this feat of the imagination only gives us 9 million stars , and this is still only a tiny fraction of the whole number of stars in the sky . It is the number of letters in about forty books , each the size of this one . To imagine the total number of stars in the sky we must think of a huge library of at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters of type on all the pages of all the books of this library will be about equal in number to the stars in the sky . If we read at the rate of a page every minute for eight hours a day , it will take us 700 years to read through this library . In the same way , if we count the stars at the rate of 1500 a minute ? 25 a second ? it will take us 700 years to count them all . Our earth is a tiny appendage to one , and a rather inconspicuous one , of this vast multitude of stars . It is less ? very much less ? than the dot of an " i " in our library of half a million volumes ; it ought rather to be compared to a microscopic speck of dust imprisoned between two pages . And this is the speck of dust whose inhabitants thought , until about 300 years ago , that it was the centre of the universe , and that all the other stars circled round it ? had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle round it , and shed a bit of light on it now and then in the absence of the sun and moon . We begin to see now how insignificant our home in space really is , and yet , as we shall see in the next chapter , the greater part of the story remains to be told . CHAPTER VII OUT IN THE DEPTHS OF SPACE WE have seen how , when little was known about astronomy , it was natural to imagine that the stars went on for ever and ever , so that , however far one probed into space , one merely came to more stars . It was only like the town-bred child imagining that the lamp-posts go on for ever and ever . Yet we now know that if we go far enough out into space , we come to regions where the stars first begin to thin out , and then disappear altogether : we are now out in the depths of space beyond the Milky Way . The stars are like the lights of a vast city , but no city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go far enough , we get out of the city , and come at last to the dark open country beyond . Yet this is not the whole story . We now know that the wheel-shaped system of stars bounded by the Milky Way is not the only system of stars in space . Far beyond the Milky Way are other cities , each with its own system of lights . The dark open country which surrounds our own city is not the end of everything ; if we persevere through it for long enough , we shall come in time to another city whose lights are stars similar to those surrounding our sun . Let me explain the evidence for this statement . When we are far out at sea we can not see the lights 108 // of a seaside town as separate points of light ; they all run together and form a sort of confused cloud of light . Then , as our ship brings us nearer inshore , we begin to see the separate lights , first the brightest and later on the fainter ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant star-cities far out in space . We have not come any nearer to them , but the ever-increasing power of our telescopes has , in a sense , brought them ever nearer to us , and , just in the last few years , we have begun to see their individual lights , and recognise them for what they are ? cities of stars like our own . Their nature had , however , been suspected long before it was known with certainty . In 1755 the philosopher Kant described them as " systems of many stars , whose distance presents them in such a narrow space that the light which is individually imperceptible from each of them , reaches us , on account of their immense multitude , in a uniform pale glimmer . " As they were only seen as dim clouds of light , they were called " nebulae , " a Latin word meaning mists or clouds . Not all nebulae consist of groups of stars . True nebulae are of two distinct types , which can be distinguished by their shapes . The first type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second type are completely irregular in shape ; they form by far the more impressive objects when seen in a telescope , but only because they are nearer to us ? just as the moon looks more impressive than Betelgeux . They generally look rather like drifting masses of smoke such as one sees when a house or a haystack is on fire . And , indeed , they are , so to speak , only the smoke of our own star-city , lighted up by the lights of our own star-city ; they are wisps and clouds of dust and luminous gas stretching from star to // star within the confines of the Milky Way , and forming light and dark patches against the sky , much as the smoke and flame of an ordinary fire form light and dark patches against the sky . Two examples of this type of nebula , both in the constellation of Orion , have already been shewn on Plate XXVII ( p. 74 ) and Plate XXX ( p. 95 ) . A third , in the constellation of Cygnus , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPACE The other type , the nebulae of regular shape , are the distant cities of stars . They are so far away that they look singularly ineffective when viewed directly , even through a powerful telescope . Their faint light makes very little impression on our eyes . The brightest of them all , the Great Nebula in Andromeda ( see Plate XXXVI ) , was described by the astronomer Marius as looking like " a candle-light seen through horn . " To understand what these nebulae are , we must let their light impress itself , hour after hour , and perhaps even night after night , on a photographic plate . When this is done detached individual lights begin to emerge from the general light of the nebulae ( see Plate XXXVII ) . These prove to be stars . We know that they are stars , because many of them are unmistakable Cepheid variables , shewing exactly the same characteristic and familiar fluctuations of light as the Cepheid variables nearer home . This is a great piece of good fortune , because , as we have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable from its apparent brightness or faintness . The Cepheid variables in the nebulae all appear very faint , and as we know that they are // very bright stars in themselves , this alone proves that the nebulae are at very great distances . We need rather a long yard-stick to measure this kind of distance . Light travels 11 million miles in a minute , and so about 6 million million miles in a year . Astronomers take this distance as their unit of measurement , and call it a " light-year . " When the Germans speak of a distance of an hour , they mean the distance a man walks in an hour . In the same way , when an astronomer speaks of a light-year , he means the distance light travels in a year . THE NEAREST STAR-CITIES We have seen how the light from the nearest of the globular clusters takes 18,400 years to reach us , or as we can now say , the nearest globular cluster is at a distance of 18,400 light-years . But the nearest nebula , the nebula M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proves to be about 850,000 light-years distant ; it is more than forty times as remote as the nearest globular cluster . The light by which we see the globular clusters had started on its long journey through space before man had become civilised , but that from even the nearest of the nebulae had started before man existed at all . If the first man to inhabit the earth had built a wireless station and sent out a call , calling all stations in space to inquire if there were any other intelligent beings in the universe , his call would not yet have reached the nearest of the nebulae . Even the furthest of the globular clusters is less than a quarter as far from us as the nearest nebula . After we // have left all the globular clusters behind , we must go four times further before we begin to encounter the nebulae . And as the globular clusters map out the confines of the Milky Way , this means that the nebulae are entirely clear of the Milky Way . If we take London to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in space will lie somewhere near Cambridge ; there is plenty of open country in between . The second nearest star-city is only a shade further away , at a distance of 900,000 light-years . If the nearest star-city in space is represented by Cambridge , this may suitably be represented by Oxford . It is the Great Nebula in Andromeda ( see Plates XXXVI , XXXVII and XLII ( p. 115 ) ) , the best known of all the star-cities out in space , and the only one which is quite distinctly visible to the unaided eye . It lies almost north of the star Beta Andromedae ( see Star-Map I and p. 147 ) . As a spectacle , it must be admitted that it is very disappointing , and yet it is perhaps worth looking at once in a lifetime , if only to reflect , while you look on it , that the retina of your eye is being affected by light which has travelled uninterruptedly for 900,000 years to reach you . Waves of light , generated by the jumping about of electrons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undisturbed through space ever since , and now , as they enter your eye , are encountering solid substance for the first time since they left the nebula . They come in an unbroken sequence , at the rate of about 500 million million every second , and the ray of light which connects your eye up with the nebula contains enough waves to keep up the supply of waves at this rate for 900,000 years ; those who like arithmetic can calculate the exact number . Not many nebulae are near enough for Cepheid va- // riables to be detected in them . When this can be done , the sizes and distances of the nebulae can be discovered at once , but in most cases , other methods must be used . If a number of exactly similar objects are placed at different distances from us , they of course look of different sizes , but their surface-brightness is not affected by distance ; it would be if there were dimming or obscuring matter in space , but we have every reason to think that there is so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few special parts of the sky . Now Dr. Hubble of Mount Wilson Observatory finds that nebulae of the same shape all appear to have the same surface-brightness , and differ only in apparent size . This suggests strongly that they are similar structures which differ only in being at different distances from us , so that we can tell their distances either from their apparent sizes or from the amount of light we receive from them ; in brief , the smaller and fainter a nebula appears , the more distant it is . Plate XL shews a cluster of nebulae in Coma Berenices , at a probable distance of SO million light-years : nebulae are so thick in this part of the sky that the plate contains more nebulae than stars . Plate XLI shews a still more distant cluster of nebulae in Pegasus . Every one of the faint ill-defined objects in the plate is a nebula , there being 162 in all ; many of these , could we see them from near enough , would appear as vast systems with complicated structures like those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 116 ) . The most distant of all the nebulae revealed by our telescopes are so remote that their light takes about 140 millions of years to reach us . Our comparison of the Galactic System and the two nearest nebulae to London , Oxford and Cambridge // proves to have been a good one in many ways . The largest telescopes reveal about two million nebulae in all , not a single one of which , so far as we can tell , is as large as our own star-city , so that , to begin with , we did well to compare this to London , the largest city in the world . Indeed many astronomers are inclined to regard the Galactic System as an aggregation of a number of overlapping star-cities , just as London is an aggregation of overlapping towns . If London represents the Galactic System in size , Cambridge and Oxford just about represent the sizes of the two nearest star-cities . And the comparison holds good in respect of the number of inhabitants as well as of the arrangement in space ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Oxford , and our own starcity contains something like 100 times as many stars as either of its two nearest neighbours . It may , however , seem surprising that we can speak with so much confidence as to the total number of stars in nebulae which are so remote that we can see only a few of their very brightest stars . WEIGHING THE STAR-CITIES We have seen how our own system of stars , the Galactic System , is flat like the solar system . Also , like the solar system , it can preserve its flat shape because it is in a state of rotation . Many of the nebulae are also flat in shape , and it would seem reasonable to conjecture that they , too , preserve their flat shape through being in a state of rotation . Observation confirms this conjecture , for these nebulae are found to be rotating . It must almost certainly be this motion of rotation which saves the stars on their rims from falling in towards // their centres . If we know the speed of this motion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so can weigh the nebulae ? just as , nearer home , we weigh the sun or Jupiter or the whole Galactic System of stars . The average nebula is found to have two or three thousand million times the weight of the sun . This does not necessarily mean that there are this number of stars in each nebula . Few , if any , of the nebulae appear to consist solely of stars ; most of them have a central region which looks more like a cloud of gas than a cloud of stars . At any rate no telescope in existence can break it up into stars ( see Plate XLII ) . It must of course exert the same gravitational pull as an equal weight of stars , so that the weight of this cloud of gas , or whatever it is , is included in our estimate of the weight of the nebula . But if these apparent clouds of gas do not already consist of stars , it seems likely that they are destined to form stars in due course of time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVOLUTION OF THE NEBULAE The two nearest nebulae , which we have compared to Cambridge and Oxford , are about as flat as pancakes . Our own system of stars , the Galactic System , is also flat , although not to quite such an extreme degree . But not all the regular-shaped nebulae are flat . Plates XLIV and XLV shew various types of observed nebulae . We see that some are as round as cricket balls . Others are a bit flattened , like an orange . Others are far more flattened , and so it goes on , until finally we come to the completely flat nebulae like the two nearest home . We can arrange the various shapes of nebulae in order of flatness , just as we could arrange a heap of // beads in order of size , or colour , or shape , or by any other single characteristic we please . In Plates XLIV and XLV they have been so arranged . Now when we have arranged the nebulae in order of flatness , we find that a number of other characteristics also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as though we had threaded a heap of beads on a string , the largest at one end , the smallest at the other , and then discovered that not only the size , but also the shape and colour changed gradually on this as we passed along the string , so that in trying to arrange our beads by size we had unwittingly arranged them by colour and shape at the same time . We find , for instance , that , broadly speaking , the flattest nebulae are the largest , and vice versa ; our arrangement by flatness is also an arrangement by size . The same is true of shape : two nebulae which have the same degree of flatness are generally almost identical in shape , and so on . In brief , nearly all of the regular-shaped nebulae can be arranged in a single sequence , like beads on a string , and all their characteristics change gradually as we pass along the string . Or again , to go back to our old comparison , it is as though we had started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange them by size , and then find that we have at the same time arranged them also in order of weight , height , length of coat , and so on . We should conclude that all the dogs were of one breed , and might suspect that the order of our arrangement was approximately one of increasing age . In the same way we may say that the majority of the nebulae are of the same breed , and it seems most likely that the single sequence in which they can be arranged is simply one of increasing age , or , to be slightly more acOUT // curate , of advancing stages of development . In spite of their marked diversity of appearance , the different nebulae probably differ mainly in being more or less advanced in development , like a sequence of babies , children , boys , men and greybeards . THE BIRTH OF THE STARS One other characteristic , which has not so far been mentioned , also changes gradually as we pass along our string of nebulae ; it is , perhaps , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is occupied by nebulae with no flattening at all , nebulae which are as round as cricket balls . No stars can be detected in any of these : they look like mere fuzzy balls of gas or fuzzy clouds of dust . As we pass along the string the nebulae get flatter , but for a long time no stars can be detected in them . It is only after they have become very flat that stars first begin to shew . They appear first at the outer edges , the regions near the rim of the nebulae . Then as we pass along our string to still flatter nebulae , the starry regions occupy more and ever more of the nebula until finally even the centre succumbs and breaks up into stars . Indeed Dr. Hubble has shewn that the sequence shewn in Plates XLIVXLVI can be extended quite naturally by the addition , first , of our nearest neighbour in space M 33 ( Plate XXXVIII , p. 111 ) , which is nearly all stars , and then by the addition of the lesser Magellanic Cloud ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but stars . The nebula is now nothing but a cloud of stars ? a starcity of the kind we have already discussed . Thus our string or sequence of nebulae starts with something that looks like a fluffy , featureless ball of // gas , and ends up as a city of stars . It would in any case be hard to resist the conjecture that such a sequence is one of advancing development , so that as we pass along it , what was originally a cloud of formless gas has been condensing into stars . We can , however , check this conjecture by calculating mathematically how a cloud of hot gas would behave as it gradually cooled down with advancing age . We find that it would go through the sequence of shapes and conditions represented on our string of nebulae , and end up as a cloud of stars . More than this , we can calculate what amount of gas ought to go to form each star ? in other words , we can tell what would be the weight of stars formed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , because we do not know enough about the state of the original gas , but even without this knowledge it seems fairly clear that stars formed in this conjectural way would have just about the weights which actual stars have . This makes it highly probable that the stars are nothing but condensed drops of gas , of course on the astronomical scale , born through nebulous masses of gas condensing into detached blobs , much as a cloud of steam condenses into drops of water . This explains very simply why stars occur in big groups ? the cities of stars ; each star-city is the produce of a single ball of nebulous gas . Thus we must think of the regular-shaped nebulae , not only as the dwellingplaces , but also as the birth-places , of the stars . There they are born , live and die . When we arrange photographs of actual nebulae in a continuous sequence in the way I have described ? globular nebulae at one end , flat ones at the other ? and look along such a sequence ( as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XXXVIII , XXXI in this order ) , we see a chaotic mass of gas changing gradually but steadily into a multitude of stars . We are in effect studying the birth of the stars . We discover at once why the stars all have much the same weight ; it is because they are all formed by the same process . They are almost like manufactured articles turned out of the same machine . THE EVOLUTION OF THE STARS The stars do not of course permanently retain the weights they have at birth . We have already seen how they are continually losing weight , destroying their substance and turning it into radiation . Although there is plenty of divergence of opinion , most astronomers agree in thinking that the average star is born as a very fluffy baby of quite large size . Star-babies differ from human babies in that they lose size as well as weight as they grow older , and their candle-power wanes at the same time . If these views are correct , our sun is not only losing weight at the rate of 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and brilliancy . If we look far enough ahead in time we see it shrunk to an " oldman " star ? possibly a " white dwarf , " such as the faint companion to Sirius now is . It will not emit heat enough to prevent everything on earth freezing , so that in all probability all life will have disappeared from the earth before then . Instead , however , of peering further into this rather dismal future , let us look backwards in time , and review the past history of our sun . First we see it merely as a baby star ? a fluffier , larger and more luminous globe than it now is . Further back still , we can hardly call it a star at all : it is merely a yet more fluffy blob of // gas , mixed up with other similar blobs in a nebula of fuzzy gas ? the nebula which is destined ultimately to condense into our star-city . And scattered all through space are other gaseous nebulae which in the course of time will form other star-cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further back in time , although only rather conjecturally . Let us imagine , as a conjecture , that at the beginning of time the whole of space was uniformly filled with gas , just as a large hall or cathedral is filled with the air we breathe . Then it can be proved that the gas would not stay spread uniformly through space in this way , but would immediately begin to condense into detached balls . Once again we can calculate how much gas would go to form each ball . And the result of the calculation is significant ; we find that each ball would contain just about as much gas as each of the nebulae that we believe are destined to form star-cities . This makes is probable that the matter of the universe started as a gas uniformly diffused through space , and that the nebulae originated by the condensation of this gas . If this conjecture is sound we can piece together the story of the evolution of the universe somewhat as follows . THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE We start at the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form the sun and stars , the earth and the planets , your bodies and mine , and also all the radiation which has been poured out from the sun and // stars ever since , are jumbled together and form a chaotic mass of gas filling the whole of space . As the gravitational pull of each bit of gas acts on all the other bits of gas , currents are gradually set up . Wherever these currents produce a slight accumulation of gas , the gravitational pull is increased , so that each small accumulation draws still more gas in towards it ; Nature acts according to the law " Unto him that hath shall be given . " The successful bits of gas grow into huge condensations which continually increase at the expense of the unsuccessful bits ; these they ultimately swallow up into themselves . Just as the earth , sun and planets have assumed regular shapes under the action of gravitation , so these condensations now begin to assume regular shapes : they form what we have called regularshaped nebulae . The currents of gas which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are not strictly globular in shape . At first they are orange-shaped , like our rotating earth . As they shrink , their shapes continually change and they flatten out ever more and more . Again we see the gas in their outer fringes condensing into distinct masses , and the stars being born ; the formless nebulae are changed into star-cities which are flat at birth and remain flat because of their rotation . And now , as we watch the great drama enacting itself , we may notice a particular star , our sun , meeting with the unusual accident we have already described . A second star approaches it more closely than any star has ever before done , and raises tides higher than have ever been raised before ? tides like huge mountains of fiery gas travelling over the sun 's surface . Finally the second star comes so near that , to anyone standing on the sun , it would fill up a large part of the sky . As it does // so , the gravitational pull of the second star becomes so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and itself condenses into drops . These drops are the planets , and one of the smaller of them is our earth . At first it is a chaotic mass of fiery gas , but , as it cools , its centre liquefies . In time it becomes so cool that a solid crust forms over its surface . And later , when it is cooler still , a strange new phenomenon appears on this solid crust . Groups of atoms begin to combine into coherent organisations of the kind which we ? knowing nothing of their nature or of the way they first started into being ? describe as life . Whatever this life is , it shews a strange capacity for reproducing itself , and as it does so , it for ever forms organisations of greater and greater complexity . Finally we see ourselves , standing at the furthest point to which time has so far unrolled itself and representing the most complex organism that has so far been produced on earth . Whether there is more complex life on other planets of other suns , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , we simply do not know . But as we look back down the almost endless vistas of the great corridor of time , we realise that our race is an absolutely new corner in the universe ; our brief past is a mere speck of time in the history of the universe . Still the great panorama goes on unrolling itself , and , turning our backs on the part already unrolled , we face a future stretching out to thousands and probably millions of times greater length than our past ? a future longer than anything our minds can imagine . We realise that we are , in all probability , at the very beginning of the life of our race ; we are still only at the dawn of the day of almost unthinkable length . CHAPTER VIII THE GREAT UNIVERSE A CENTURY ago astronomy was concerned with little beyond the sun , moon and planets ? the small colony we have described as the sun 's family . To-day it is mainly engaged in studying in detail the various other stars and colonies of stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpha Centauri , our nearest neighbours in space . The aggregate of all such stars and colonies constitutes the Galactic System , the vast conglomeration of stars whose rim is the Milky Way . At the same time , astronomy has discovered that even this huge system is only one of a vast number of somewhat similar systems . The present situation may be perhaps summed up in the three statements : ( 1 ) The earth is only one member of the sun 's family . ( 2 ) The sun 's family is only one member of the Galactic System . ( 3 ) The Galactic System is only one member of the system of star-cities in space . This is the furthest that astronomy has travelled so far , but we may well wonder what the situation will be , say , a thousand years hence . Will the above three statements still suffice , or will they have been supplemented by more statements of the same kind ? In other words , shall we find that the whole system of star-cities 123 // only forms one unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere unit in something vaster still ? The question is an old one . As far back as 1755 , Kant wrote , in his Theory of the Heavens : If the grandeur of a planetary world in which the earth , as a grain of sand , is scarcely perceived , fills the understanding with wonder , with what astonishment are we transported when we behold the infinite multitude of worlds and systems which fill the extension of the Milky Way ! But how is this astonishment increased , when we become aware of the fact that all these immense orders of star-worlds again form but one of a number whose termination we do not know , and which perhaps , like the former , is a system inconceivably vast ? and yet again but one member in a new combination of members ! We see the first members of a progressive relationship of worlds and systems ; and the first part of this infinite progression enables us already to recognise what must be conjectured of the whole . There is here no end but an abyss of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human conception sinks exhausted . It was a sensational conjecture , but modern science does not confirm it . Instead , it tells us that the system of star-cities constitutes the complete universe . If there is anything beyond , it can only be other complete universes , having no interaction with our own , so that the three statements on p. 123 are complete , and admit of no extension . A MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE We have compared the great nebulae in space to star- cities . We took London to represent our own city of stars , the system of stars in which our sun figures as a // very ordinary citizen , and whose most remote members form the Milky Way . Then we saw that the two nearest star-cities in space might appropriately be compared to Cambridge and Oxford . Each inch in London or Cambridge or Oxford represents about 1Y2 million million miles in the corresponding star-cities , the distance which light travels in three months . And each inch in the open country between London and Cambridge or Oxford represents the same distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect building a sort of model , drawn to scale , of our own starsystem and its nearest neighbours in space . The scale of the model is of course exceedingly small . It reduces the yearly path of the earth round the sun to a microscopic speck an eight-thousandth of an inch in diameter , and the whole solar system , right out to the orbit of Pluto , becomes only the size of a grain of sand . All the stars which we can see with our unaided eyes lie within a few yards of this grain of sand ; most of them , indeed , within a few feet . The system of Alpha Centauri is less than 18 inches away , and Sirius less than a yard . Let us go on building our model on the same scale . The largest telescope on earth shews about two million regular-shaped nebulae , so that about two million star-cities must be placed in our model . London , Cambridge and Oxford give quite good representations of the three we have so far discussed , but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the most part these are not quite so close as we and our nearest neighbours happen to be ; we inhabit a rather thickly populated region of space . On an average , light or a wireless message takes something like two million years to travel from one star-city to the // next nearest city in space . We realise what ephemeral beings we are in the universe , when we reflect that to flash a signal from one star-city to the next and get an answer back requires 60,000 times the span of a man 's life . The nebulae shewn in Plate XLIII , at a distance of 50 million light-years , must be placed in our model at about 3100 miles from London ; they would be represented by a group of cities and towns somewhere in the eastern United States of America . The furthest of the nebulae that we see in space are about 140 million light-years away ? their light takes 140 million years to reach us . With our own star-city as London , and our nearest neighbour as Cambridge , these furthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . Where does this take us ? A journey of 8500 miles from London over the earth 's surface may take us to Cape Horn or Western Australia or mid-Polynesia or the Antarctic Continent ? we can put our furthest starcities at any of these places , and their distances from London will be about right on the scale of our model . These , together with the less distant nebulae , will now have covered almost the whole of the earth 's surface . Only a small region round the Antipodes remains unoccupied ? to be exact , the interior of a circle , less than 4000 miles in radius , lying in the Southern Pacific Ocean . If we are building our model on the earth 's surface , we have not much room left for representing still more distant parts of space . Yet we must remember that the American astronomers are planning a new telescope with power to probe twice as far into space as any at present in existence ; they may reasonably hope soon to be discovering nebulae // twice as remote as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to go into our model , we must place them 17,000 miles from London . So long as we stay on the earth 's surface , we can not ( lo it . It is easy enough to take a journey of 17,000 miles over the earth 's surface , but this will not take us 17,000 miles from London . Indeed it will bring us nearly back to London , for we shall have gone threequarters of the way round the world . This , you may think , shews that the earth 's surface was a very bad object to choose as a model of space ; we ought to have chosen something in which we can travel on for as far as we want ? for ever , if the need arises . Not only did Kant think this in 1755 , as witness the passage already quoted , but most scientists would have thought the same even twenty years ago . To-day , however , we think that in one respect at least the earth 's surface gives a very good model of space . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , because it is of limited amount , because it does not contain room for endless star-cities stretching away into endless depths of space . THE FINITE UNIVERSE We have seen how , until quite recently , astronomers felt very little interest in anything beyond the sun , moon , planets , and the few nearest stars . It was not a matter of choice . Their feeble telescopes were inadequate to explore any great distance into space ; whether they liked it or not , they were limited to the regions near home . They were like the Greek sailors who , three thousand years ago , explored a few small islands in the Aegean Sea . These few islands were the whole of the // world for them , because they had no means of navigating to greater distances . They cared little whether the ocean round them stretched for hundreds or for thousands or for millions of miles ; they could never in any case hope to get to its more remote regions . Then men learned how to increase the size and power of their ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of navigation . Longer and longer journeys were taken over the sea until , in the great times of Magellan and Drake , ships were taken round the whole world to return to their starting-point . The entire world then lay open for exploration . But , more than this , the size of the world was now known . It had been proved that the earth 's surface did not extend for an infinite distance ; there was only a limited amount awaiting exploration and survey , and men could hope that before very long the whole of the earth 's surface would be known to them . And indeed we of to-day , four centuries later , can say that it is almost all known . The astronomy of to-day is reaching a position similar to that of the geography of four centuries ago . The early astronomers did not concern themselves overmuch as to whether space went on for ever or not , because they knew that in any case its further stretches were as much beyond their reach as the Antipodes were beyond the reach of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern astronomer regards the universe as a finite closed space , as finite as the surface of the earth , and if he is not yet acquainted with the whole universe , he has good reason to hope that he will be before very long . We of to-day no longer think of vast unknown and unsounded depths of space , stretching interminably away from us in all directions . We are beginning to think of the universe as Columbus , and after him MaTHE // gellan and Drake , thought of the earth ? something enormously big , but nevertheless not infinitely big ; something whose limits we can fix ; something capable of being imagined and studied as a single complete whole ; something capable of being circumnavigated , if you like . And this explains why , in one respect at least , the earth 's surface gives a good model of space . If we travel straight on over the earth 's surface for long enough , we come back to our starting-point ; we have travelled round the world . Scientists now believe that if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should also come back to our starting-point ; we should have travelled round the universe . The reasons for this belief are not astronomical in their nature , and it was not an astronomer who discovered that space must bend back on itself like the surface of the earth ; it was Einstein , who is a mathematician and a physicist . If his theory of relativity is true , space can not go on for ever ; it must bend back on itself like the surface of the earth . And now you will ask whether this theory of relativity is true ? I can not tell you for certain . All I can say is that every single experiment which has ever been performed to test the theory of relativity has decided in its favour . For this reason scientists to-day have no hesitation in accepting both the theory and its consequences . And one of the most important of these is that space is not of unlimited extent , but curves back on itself , and finally closes up , like the earth 's surface . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes up , there are two ways from London to New Zealand . A traveller may go east via Suez and the Indian Ocean , or he may go west via America and the Pacific Ocean . Every summer a great number of New // Zealanders come from New Zealand to London , some travelling one way , some the other , so that when they meet in London , some arrive from the east , and some from the exactly opposite direction , the west . In the same way , if space is like the surface of the earth , there must similarly be two ways from one end of the universe to the other . If we still take London to represent our own star-city , a star-city in a region of space corresponding to New Zealand will be sending out light in all directions . Some of this must fall on the earth , and we see the nebula by it . But the star-city will also be sending out light in exactly the opposite direction , and some of this , coming the other way round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we shall see the star-city by this light also . Light from the same star-city will be reaching us along two exactly opposite directions , like the New Zealanders reaching London . Consequently we shall be able to see the same star-city by looking along two diametrically opposite directions in space . To take a definite instance , the star-city nearest us in space is the nebula M 33 , in the constellation Triangulum . If light can travel round the whole of space , some of the light from this nebula ought to reach us from the direction exactly opposite to the constellation Triangulum , so that on looking in this opposite direction we ought to see the nebula M 33 , although of course only as a very small and dim object , because the light by which we see it would have travelled nearly all round the universe to reach us . In the same way , if we look in the direction exactly opposite to the constellation Andromeda , we ought to see our second nearest neighbour in space , the Great Nebula in Andromeda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we turn our telescopes in the directions
