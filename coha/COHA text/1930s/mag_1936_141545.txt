RICH LAND , POOR LAND-Stuart Chase - Whittlesey House ( $2.50 ) . <P> Among U. S. economists . Stuart Chase has a reputation for being the best storyteller of the lot . Master of the art of leading audiences up the mountain , he has held out bold and attractive visions of happy economic futures , plausible-sounding and easily-attained , in most of the sprightly , bright , informal , argumentative volumes he has written in the past eleven years . Interspersing his books with anecdotes , personal reminiscences , moral tirades against waste , he has always discussed human problems as an economist , economic problems as an evangelist , political problems as an engineer , and philosophic problems as an irascible citizen who wants to know why something is not done . Last week Stuart Chase offered a typical volume to stand beside his The Tragedy of Waste . In Rich Land , Poor Land , he discusses for 347 pages the natural resources of the U. S. , their exhaustion , misapplication , cost and preservation . <P> The book is somewhat like an old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers , plains , mountain ranges , rainfall , Stuart Chase proceeds to long , eloquent , angry lament on the squandering of native riches . Like the Whitman of a bankrupt country , he composes a great catalog of lost national wealth , including the buffalo , the passenger pigeon , eastern salmon , Pacific halibut , petroleum , timber , coal , the great auk , the Carolina parakeet , the drought-impoverished Dust Bowl . It is a disturbing account , calculated to make any responsible citizen treasure every green tree and each clear brook of his native land . The oyster catch declined from 25 million bushels in 1901 to 16 million in 1926 . Beavers " were butchered to make ugly hats , " thereby removing a genial animal as well as causing floods . In 1857 the Ohio legislature decided that passenger pigeons " the most abundant and the most beautiful of American game birds , " needed no protection . The last existing specimen died in Cincinnati in 1914 . " One solitary heath hen was living at last accounts . " * The catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to less than one million . Enough timber is destroyed by forest fires every year to build a five-room house every 100 feet on both sides of the road from New York to Chicago , although the effect of that , Stuart Chase observes , " might be worse than the conflagration. "
