 | Tenements , you would call them ? Palaces , they were . Mrs. Marks herself said so as she marched through the houses on that opening day . Palaces ! The stairways were bare black iron and the rooms were ten by twelve because the idea was the more rooms in the less space the less overhead and the cheaper you could give it to the people , and the kids from twelve families rattled up and down the iron stairs , and the radios from twelve flats sang into the six-foot courts , but it was just like the Garden of Eden with stucco walls and automatic refrigeration for the working classes . JOE JORACEK was one of the laborers who carried planks and pipes in the construction of the Gardens , and when the job was finished he said , this is a pretty good place for the money , maybe I move in myself . It was kind of far to go to work , especially if you got work in the city ; it cost two fares and took an hour and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street cars would run across the bridge and then it would be just like right inside the city , costing only one fare . Anyway , what for would he have to go to the city to work ? The  | Marks Company was going to build up a whole lot more blocks around here , so there would be plenty of work right here for a long time yet , so why move anywhere else ? Anna Joracek looked into the new houses and saw the little rooms , but Marie , her daughter , looked and saw the automatic refrigerators . " What can I do with them ? " Anna said . " That 's for making ice . " And Marie showed her . Then Anna thought , Marie is growing up , it will be fine to have a nice home for her . And Anna knew that all the swell homes like in hotels and elevator apartments had ten-by-twelve rooms and kitchenette refrigerators . So Joe and Anna bought a new set of furniture for a hundred and sixty-nine dollars on payments ; for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden designs on the purple plush , and the furniture dealer threw in free as a compliment an end table with carved mahogany legs . They bought a new bed with fancy posts ; and for the bed Anna had to get a stylish store quilt , yellow with red stitching ; this they would sleep under instead of the thick old comforter she had brought from the other country . Then she bought table lamps and a bridge lamp and beautiful  | lamp-shades with many pear-shaped domes like the domes of the churches in the old country ; she made fringes of hand-knitted lace for the lamp-shades . Mrs. Joracek had a fine time fixing up the new flat . Joe made beer in the tile bathroom . Marie got little books from the gas company and made all kinds of cold pink jelly in the refrigerator . BECAUSE she knew this was the day they were coming to kick her out of the flat , Anna Joracek could not even get up heart enough to make the bed in the morning . First , after she got up out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quilt they slept under , then she looked at the dark hollows where their heads had lain on the pillows . The hollows were far apart , on either side of the bed . With a few flails of her arms she could beat the pillows back into shape , and she ought to pull the quilt smooth as a cover over the bed , but what was the use ? Maybe they would come right away to throw her out and she would have to take everything off again . Better she should tie all the bedding together in some way so it would not look so undressed when they put it out on the street .  | Marie was already up from the folding bed ; she never got up so early but to-day she had even put the bed together , acting as if it was a special day . " Why could n't you sleep ? Sleep a while longer , " Anna said to Marie . " I could n't sleep , " Marie said . She stood waiting with eagerness , as if to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . He always did that ; got up at six o'clock just like when he had to go to work , just to show he was n't lazy . There he had been sitting for an hour , pulling at his hands . If nobody brought him some coffee it would n't matter either ; he would just keep on sitting there until they came and carried him out , chair and all , and put him sitting on the sidewalk . She almost had to laugh at the thought of it . Yah , Joe . Anna tied her skirt around her and went and took up the coffee pot . She looked inside at the grounds ; no , it was like sour-smelling mud . There was still some new coffee in the bag , and it might as well be good coffee to-day , so instead of adding only a little fresh coffee to help out the grounds she emptied all out from yesterday , and cleaned the pot , and put in new coffee . But not a lot . Marie said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | pot to go across the hall to Mrs. Feingold 's , where they had been cooking since their gas was shut off . So Marie was going to act like an angel to-day , herself jumping to do things instead of having to be told , acting as if she understood something sad was happening , just as she had acted with a grand sadness the time last year when Anna Joracek 's sister had died . Only to-day was not the same kind of trouble as death ; and Anna Joracek watched her Marie , thinking maybe when people are so young all troubles seem the same kind of trouble . Other times Marie pretended she hated to go in there to the Feingolds ' . On account of Red Feingold , Anna knew ; Red bothered Marie . He said dirty words so she could hear them . But to say he bothered her was not the whole thing . Sometimes , Anna felt , her Marie hung around on the street , walking down the block with her girl friends just so she would pass by where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to ask for something . But what would it matter after to-day ? Anna gave Marie the coffee pot , while she herself turned about in the room , feeling surrounded with so much to do this day . But really there was nothing to do ; she did not want to begin to pack  | things up ; until they came she would not touch a rag . After all , maybe nothing would happen , maybe the men would not come , or maybe there would be a slip of paper giving them another week . Then she would have to unpack everything . THE electric light was still burning a sickly yellow in the hallway , making Marie feel she was up so early it was still part of the night . The janitor would turn off the light at nine o'clock when he came to collect the slop pails . Just as she crossed , Mr. Herbert Stratford came out of his door at the end of the hall ; he was an old man wearing a stiff black coat and a wing collar ; Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the night he would be stretched out on the bed wearing the same coat and collar . As Mr. Stratford came out the door , his old lady called after him , " But the postman does not come for an hour yet ! " Even when she said a few words like that you could tell that long ago she was from Germany . Mr. Stratford did not mind what she said , but almost as if her words had driven him , marched down the stairs to look in the mailbox . All day long every day he did that , marching down the  | stairs every half-hour to look for a letter . He was waiting for a communication from the government to inform him that he had been appointed to a position in the " civil service . " For a long time now , since before Marie had ever seen him , Mr. Stratford had not had a job . But she knew there had been a time before she could remember , a time spoken of when Mr. Stratford had worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was what made him seem a very old man to her . Twenty years begun and ended , like the whole life of a great-grandfather who had lived and died before she ever had been born . Now Mr. Stratford waited for a letter to come any moment , direct from the government to him , and when that letter came he would again be some one who had a job . Marie knew people according to if they were people who had a job , or not . In that way Mr. Stratford might be like her own father , except that she could remember when her father had worked , so he seemed a better kind of man than old Mr. Stratford . Mr. Stratford was like those men who sat in the public library reading a dictionary all day long ; they were men who would never again do anything . They were men who would never again be young .  | Mrs. Stratford was different . She worked . She could be thought of as much younger than her husband , as still alive and kicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to fix Mr. Stratford a snack for lunch . " Do n't bother , " he would say . " I do n't need it . I can take care of myself . " But she would leave the lunch standing on the table , and when she came back in the evening it would be gone , and the dishes would be washed and put away . Mr. Stratford would not leave dirty dishes around the house for his wife to wash . No . To him , it was wrong for the lady of the house to wash dishes . His mother had never washed dishes . There was always a maid in the house . And when he cleaned his luncheon plates it was not as if Mr. Stratford was doing that task , but as if he took leave of himself while he put on the black over-sleeves that he had been accustomed to wear on his arms when he was a clerk writing in the ledgers of the Express company , he became some one else , a dishwasher for those moments ; but after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he removed the sleeves , put on his coat , and walked through the room gazing upon the dishes with the eye of a master who appraises a servant 's task .  | Mr. Stratford was very delicate and particular about the kind of work he would do . He was a clerk , he said . And his wife was a  --  a nurse , he said . But when Mrs. Stratford got a job where she had to bring her own mop and pails she left the things at night with Mrs. Feingold and picked them up as she went out in the morning , so Mr. Stratford would not know . Mr. Stratford would be ashamed of her for doing such work . In his heart he had never forgiven her for being a foreigner , a German . His marriage , he said to himself , was the tragedy of his life , but he bore it with noble spirit . Mrs. Stratford was not ashamed for herself . She was round and small and cheerful , with a plain red face . She looked like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the master . She had been a servant , Marie liked to imagine . He had run off with her , years ago , and now he lived his life hiding in far-away corners among the common people so that his fashionable relatives might never find him . For he was a man of refinement , a man of letters . That was what it meant to be a man of letters : he wrote letters all the time , and when he was not looking in the mailbox for replies , he was walking gravely and  | importantly to the corner to post his own correspondence to the press and to the government . ' What if he were simple Herb Stratford who came from a Methodist home in Danbury and got a job checking off packages in the Express company , and thought by never being late and never making a mistake and wearing high collars to attract the attention of his employers and win advancement  --  but he being so perfect at his job they never even thought of putting him to a higher task ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good address like the Y.M.C.A. hotel , being at last worn down by bodily loneliness , he had allowed the young round-faced German waitress in the restaurant to recognize him one day , to recommend dishes to him another day , to ask his health a third day , at last had taken her walking after work , had gone to another hotel with her , and then , tormented by his sin , had asked her to marry him ? And what if all these years he had been ashamed of her , impelled to go hide , to live in the furthest quarters of the town , feeling that he had thrown himself away for a common woman when he might , by waiting for advancement , by brilliantly seizing some slim overture of fate , have married the daughter of the president of the Express company ?  | And what if she , Mathilde , felt all the time that he was ashamed of her , but smiled upon this in him as upon a sweet tooth in a child , and what if she had no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment agencies to get days or even half-days of work , while he sat at home waiting for the government to send him a suitable appointment through the mails , coming way out here to Marks Gardens to live because the new houses with their bright bricks had an air of refinement and gentility that could be found in no other tenements at the price , and because her husband for some reason always liked to live at the furthest ends of the city . It was the women who worked , Marie knew , and took care of the men . Mrs. Feingold worked too . But Mrs. Feingold did not have a husband to feed . " He walked out on me , " she said . Marie had never seen that husband , but nevertheless she could make a picture of him , a big man slapping his hat on his head and walking out on Mrs. Feingold , while Mrs. Feingold went on talking , running after him to the very door and talking after him all the way down the stairs while he walked out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she must have stood there on the stairs and  | cursed after him , as a store-keeper swears after a customer who has walked out on a sale . Now Mrs. Feingold would be asleep . She stayed up till late at night , sometimes almost all night , at her newspaper stand , so it was only right that she should sleep during the day . Red would be up . He was a tough , all right . He was still sore because he had n't been around the time his mother had the scrap with the racketeers . He was still talking about it . " Jeez , if I had only been there . I 'd show ' em . Jumping on an old lady . " Mrs. Feingold had n't needed any help . She could take care of herself , and then some . When the bums came around asking her for a dollar a week for " protection " she told them to go to hell . She told them that plenty of times , until they got into the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street . Call a cop . Yah . A lot of good that does . But the last time was when three of the toughs came up and said they would n't take any more kidding from her , she would pay for protection or need it . She called them a lousy bunch of gutless crapeaters , and they jumped her . Then Mrs. Feingold did what got into the papers . She pulled a leg off of her stand and began swinging it around  | without looking where she hit . She never stopped batting until two of the bums were laid out and the third was lamming it for his life . By that time a couple of cops decided to put up a show of helping her , so they pinched the guy that was lamming . Then they picked up the other two bums and took them to the hospital . For a week it looked as though one of them was going to be blind where his left eye got scratched by a nail in the stick . The newspapers were full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcoat , holding the spiked club in her fist . Her face was so boiling red you could almost see the red in the paper . They called her some French name , a modern Joan of Arc . Others called her an Amazon . Marie thought now that Mrs. Feingold was a famous heroine maybe her husband would come back to her . Surely he would see her picture in the papers , and he would come home again . Marie expected him to walk up the stairs carrying a bunch of flowers . Maybe Mrs. Feingold thought something like that would happen , for all through those days there was a feeling of waiting inside her , a feeling of excitement , like you never knew what was  | coming around the corner . But he never showed up . She had the newspaper clipping pasted on a white cardboard and nailed over her stand , and for a couple of months she sold twice as many papers as before . By that time rain had smeared the newsprint all over the sagging cardboard , and business had fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again . That was Mrs. Feingold ; she lived next door . After all that stuff was in the papers , a society lady came and said she would help take care of the two children , but Mrs. Feingold said , " I guess I can take care of my own brats , " and Red said he would kick the whole society in the pants . Red was all right . Sometimes he was funny , but he was always talking about people 's pants , and people 's behinds , and then snorting a loud snickery laugh . Red Feingold was fourteen , but he looked three years older . He was kind of skinny , had pimples on his chin , had yellow hair , a twitchy mouth , and watery blue eyes . In the evening he would stand around the corner with some of the boys calling " Hey beautiful " to the girls that passed on the street . Red was the kind of kid that if he got into the subway with some fellows and girls ,  | he 'd give one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on her knees , yah , hah , suddenly opening his face and laughing that jolly laugh of his , showing his uneven broken teeth . He was a tough kid all right but a good-hearted guy . Marie never said anything , but she kind of liked it when she passed on the street and Red yelled " Hey beautiful " after her . She kind of liked to walk slowly along and see him standing sort of waiting with the rest of the boys on the sidewalk ; and just when she came near , a couple of the boys would suddenly dance out laughing and swearing and making jabs and passes boxing at each other , she always knowing they pulled the fanciest fake punches for her to see as she walked by . Red was a man already , Marie Joracek knew that too . She was n't sure just how she knew this , or exactly what it was , but she knew that it had begun maybe a couple of months ago . Red 's gang had a punk in the next block , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the girls called her . She was n't any older than Marie , Marie knew , though she went around with her waist belted tight and high to make her breasts stick out . They were big as buckets anyway , and Marie thought if she had  | breasts like that she would want to hide them . All the boys went to Josie , but you did n't see them walking on the street with her . Marie knew about when it started because that was when Red stopped horsing around so much ; before that he had used to wrestle with her , get into scraps , and slap her on the behind , but from then on he was sort of stiff near her , and once when they got into one of their arguments and she got mad and jumped on him to fight him his whole body went hard as a board and he shook her off yelling " Lemme alone , cantcha ! " But she felt forgiving toward him for his going to that girl . " Men have to do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be pure . " And she had a picture of the time when he would come to her , wild as he was , and lay his head in her lap , and ask forgiveness . And she would stroke his hair and say all right she understood . Probably she would be a movie star then . He would be a little afraid of her because she was beautiful and famous while he was just Red like he had always been ; but she knew that when she was a movie star she would be just his anyway ; she would come back and be with him no matter what he was ; like the janitor 's beautiful wife , she would bring her beauty just to her man and she  | would n't want him any different than when he was standing around the corner and bossing all the boys . Red had to be at the stand a couple of hours to catch the morning trade , he was dressing when she came into their flat . His little brother Oscar was washing ; he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any shirt on . " Hello baby , " he said when she came in , " how 's my little sweetheart ? " " Do n't yell , " she said . " You 'll wake up your mother . " " The old lady ? You could n't wake her with a steam-shovel . She sleeps like a team of horses . " " Yah ! " yelled Mrs. Feingold from her bed . " I 'll show you who is horses ! " The kid Oscar yowped laughing at Red . Red made a dive for him . " Yah , go on , laugh , laugh , " he said , knuckling Oscar 's skull , almost skinning off the hair . " Ouch , for cry sake , Red , cut it out ! " the kid yelled . " Laugh , go on , laugh , " Red said , letting him go , then pouncing after him with a punch that passed right in front of his nose . " Cut it out , willya ! " the kid yelled , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth trembled with fright . " Let him alone , " Marie said . At the same moment Mrs. Feingold 's huge voice rolled out of the bedroom , you would have thought she was booming a Lindbergh extra , " Stop it , Red ! D' ya want me to come out and lam yuh one ? " " Yah you and who else ? " said Red , winking at Marie . " I do n't need anybody else . " " Listen to the old lady ! " Red kidded . " Just because she chased a coupla flies off her stand she thinks she 's a whole pack of bloodhounds . " Marie was lighting a match on the stove . He blew it out , then struck another match on the seat of his pants and lit the gas for her . " Say ! " he said to the bedroom , " the next time those bozos come around tell them you do n't need any protection . Tell them you got a son . " " Aw do n't make me laugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na sleep . " Red lifted the lid off Marie 's pot and stuck his nose inside . " Call that coffee ? " he said . " You do n't have to drink it , " said Marie . " Feed that to the canaries , " he told her . Then  | he took a bag , grabbed out a fistful of coffee , and dumped it into the percolator top . " Say , that 'll be too strong , " she said . " I like it strong ! " he told her , sticking out his bare chest . " See that ? " He yanked up her hand and rubbed it against his chest . " That 's hair ! That 's what you need on your chest ! Hair ! " He made as if to put his and her hands down under her dress . She did n't know whether to be scared or disgusted ; then his eyes caught the look on her face , he stopped in the middle of his snickery laugh , and dropped her hand quicker than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a roll from the table . " Wan na ? " he said . " No , I do n't want any . " She kept thinking of when she would come back to him , a movie star . " Gowan , eat it . " Just to make him shut up , she took the roll . " I 'll take it inside . " " Naw , eat it yourself . " " Sure , eat it yourself , " said Oscar , from under the table . And burst into his silly laugh . Red went for him . " Do n't hit me ! Do n't hit me ! " the kid yelled , fending up his arms in terror . " Gwan beat it , " said his brother . " You wan na be late ? "  | " It ai n't late ! " said Oscar , but circled warily toward the door . They thought he was gone . After a quiet minute Marie took up her pot and said , " Well , I guess I wo n't bother you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could n't bother me enough ! " Red sidled against her . He was going to take the pot from her hand . He moved awkwardly so that his shoulder leaned over hers and the bare side of him came against her breast . He moved very slowly , like rubbing , so he could feel the soft of her against him . He felt a little drunk with the blood coming up under his face . Marie knew he was doing it on purpose , but she never moved away ; it was like a good-by . It was nice . " Ouch ! " said Oscar . " You hoo ! " His pesty little face leered at them from behind the half-opened door . Red flung after him , but his kick only landed on the closed door . They heard the kid 's small steps rattling down the iron stairs . She was n't half sore at Red . She felt sort of hurt for him . It was the only way he knew of telling her ; if he could be any different he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if by rights , to spite the kid 's laugh , he put his arm around her ,  | with his hand lifting upward under her small breast . She said , " I meant maybe I wo n't see you any more . " " Huh ? " he pulled away . " It 's all right , Red . You 're all right . " That wild angry and hurt look passed off his face . But it left him looking plain dumb , not knowing what she was talking about . " We 're moving out , " she said . " Yah ? Did your old man get a job ? " She shook her head . She changed the coffee pot from one hand to the other , then took hold of the door-knob . " Then how the hell yu gon na move ? " Red said . She was silent . There was a bigness about him now , and a gentleness , as if they had both grown older , as if he was n't standing there without a shirt on . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to him after all sorts of things had happened in between , and they had to talk things out . " Where yu gon na go ? " he said . " I du n no . " Red clicked his tongue between his teeth . " Jeez , he ca n't get a thing , huh ? "  | " There ai n't any building going on , " Marie said . Red looked at her with points of light in his small eyes . " If I had a wife and kid I 'd get something , " he told her . She was silent , as if she were walking away . " Well , we get along , do n't we ? Without an old man ? " " My pa ca n't sell papers , " Marie said . Red wore an iron ring on his finger ; there were two pointed knobs on the ring . He set the knobs right over his knuckles . " Listen , " he wet his lips , talked fast , " you can move in here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out his hand so his fingers touched her bare arm . He said , as if it were no matter to him , " We 'll put a bed in the kitchen . " Marie did n't understand if he meant that for just her , but she was afraid to make him explain , instead she let it be as if she understood he meant it for all of them . " There would n't be room enough , " she said . Then she looked up into his face , with her eyes all the way open , to let him see she trusted him , though in herself she was n't sure what kind of thing it was to trust a man , she was n't sure she would trust even herself ; but she felt she had to look at him that way with her eyes . His fingers  | tightened around her arm , and she was glad because he gave the right answer . " You do n't have to be afraid of me , kid ; I 'm not such a tough guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time both of them knew they were talking about nothing for real , because anyway Mrs. Feingold would never stand for such a thing ; yet they pretended he had the right to make the offer , and they pretended the danger of it , too , or the joy . Marie had a funny cold feeling down her back , she felt tiny and young like a trapped mouse and at the same time she felt very wise , like a woman who has had lots of children . " Say ! " Red went on , " I 'm gon na be a respectable guy . I 'm gon na own a store or something . A radio store . " " The radio business is n't so good , Red "  - -  What a crazy thing I said , she thought . " Hell , there 's gon na be television , " he came back . " Well , she put out her hand , like the hand of fate . " Good-by , Red , " she said . " Good luck . " He held onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered , " they ca n't put you out . " " Well , that 's what they 're gon na do . " " Who ? " Who ? For a moment her thoughts circled without  | finding any place to alight . Then she saw the information as it was written on the notice they had received in the mailbox . " Simon Marks Inc. , " she said . " Simon Marks hell . " That was the name that appeared a couple of times on dotted lines in the printed document . She thought of the name as somebody with a star and a lot of papers , and behind him a squad of men that looked like policemen or private detectives . Or she thought of the name as an office filled with rows of desks and blondes at switchboards and clean-shaved men behind the desks , and you never could find out which one was the right one to talk to . She repeated , for her own belief , " That 's what it said . Simon Marks Inc . They 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , " Red announced . " Who 's going to stop them ? " He lifted one shoulder higher than the other . " Me . " " Yah , " she said , pulling a grin onto her face . It was getting on her nerves now , like talking about your own funeral . " Sure , " said Red . " Just watch me . " He sounded as if he meant something ; she had  | to look close at his face . He was all right when he was this way , he was nice . " What cha gon na do ? " she said , still ready to laugh when he turned it into a joke . But his face got older . " I 'll stop them , that 's all ! " He monkeyed with the ring on his finger , set the spikes , took an imaginary sock at a copper 's jaw . " Just watch me ! " " Yah , you and who else ! " She heard her own voice sounding just like his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling her body too close to him . She opened the door , this time to leave . " You 'll see ! They ca n't chuck you out on the street like that ! What the hell ! " Quickly she touched her hand against his chin . " You 're all right , Red . You ai n't so tough , " she said . " Oh , I ai n't huh ? " He grabbed her head and kissed her across the mouth , hardly a real kiss it was so hurried and wrongly placed . She pulled away , turned a grin at him , and went fast to her door . WHILE the girl was across the hall , Anna felt this was the time for them to talk things out .  | Joe sat solid with his two hands on his two knees . He was not watching her but he knew every movement she made in the room . He was like a man on a hospital operating table who knows what the doctor is doing behind him , picking out small knives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close his readiness to be hurt . She went into the pantry and began taking things off the shelves ; but even in the corner of the small pantry she felt his waiting eyes upon her . She could no longer bear the silence between them . She would come out of the closet and say something to him , say anything , like " In a minute she 'll bring hot coffee . " Anna prepared those words . He could not bear to be any longer in the house , waiting . He got up . " In a minute  --  " she said , and saw he had risen to go out . " I do n't want any hot coffee , " he said . Then he mumbled , " I 'll be late . " He stood by his chair , undecided where to go . " Maybe I catch a job . " Anna saw him as he would be going around all day walking from one construction office to another . Everywhere he would go they would say , " Not yet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . There in front of the workshack the watchman would be sitting , holding his short pipe in his hand , gazing with his always sleepy eyes across the wide barren blocks that had been marked off for the building of houses just like these . " Not yet , " he would say . Then Joe would walk across the long new bridge , without a nickel for carfare he would walk down through the city . There where the biggest skyscraper in the world was being built , he would stop to ask maybe somebody was sick to-day , maybe they had a day 's work for a man . That never happened ; it was only something to go and ask for . " To-day you got to stay here , " she said . With his slow habit of obedience to her , he sat down . She explained , " Maybe somebody has to talk to them . " If he went out , he would not even know where to come home . What if they were moved somewhere , and he came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street ? She could see how he would stand quietly looking at the outside of the house , and then go slowly away by himself , without even trying to ask the neighbors what had happened . He would walk slowly  | down the street , if he found her all right , if he did not find her , he would only keep on walking . Could n't he stay in the house in a time like this when she needed to feel a man near her ? Why was he always trying to run away from her , in these last months ? He would rather sit alone on a bench somewhere all day than sit in the house ; sometimes she thought he would rather hide somewhere in a basement at night than sleep in her bed in the house . What was the use then of trying to hold everything together , of trying to keep a place for them to be together , with Joe feeling that way , with Joe all the time pulling to get away ? Now he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " speaking of her brother who had a candy store in Newark . " And you ? " " Me ? " He swung his head . " Stay here . Find something to do , I 'll send for you . " " No , " she said . " No . " She did not have to tell him there was no room in her brother 's place , he knew himself that there were three of them living in a couple of dark rooms back of the store , and that business was terrible for her brother . He knew all this before he had spoken , so his having spoken meant , " You  | have no other thing to do but to go there . " And for himself ? He would be standing in line to get a cup of coffee , he would be sleeping with lice on a tin bed in a warehouse ; that was what became of the men when they were left alone . Then he would move off somewhere , go on a freight train if he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be ashamed to come back to her with nothing , and if he got nothing he would never come back . She knew how it was with men . It was not like with herself , needing only him . A man would go crawl in with any woman , when the time came . She said , " There ai n't room there ; he ai n't got room for himself , my brother . " " Anyway he got a store . " So he was cursing himself now for being less than her brother because her brother had a store . It was just like her brother said : even if you owed people more than the couple of counters and the cigar case were worth , even if you did n't take in fifteen cents all day , everybody thought you had a good living because you had a store ; her brother said he would rather take a job any day , still he stuck to the store one year after another hoping things would turn better . And now because her  | brother still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen Joe , " she made a plan , " we got to sell all this furniture . They put it out on the street anyway , and we got no place to take it . If we sell the furniture we can get enough money to pay rent for a room some place for a couple of weeks , and by that time maybe you can find something . " The three of them in one room . What could he find in a couple of weeks that he had not been able to find all these months ? But the three of them sleeping in one room . " That is no good for Marie , " he said . He should be the one to say that ! The way they were to each other now , the way he had been to her for so long , did it make any difference if a young girl slept in the room ? Yet it must have cost him hard to say that . She spared him looking into his face . That was her Joe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small of himself . Even when they had been going together he had been bashful to take a cigar from her brother ; he had used to stand polite in her brother 's store as if it were the palace of some high lord , so wonderful a lord who could just put his hand into the case on the counter and take out all the cigars he wanted . " No  | thanks , " Joe would say when her brother offered him a fistful of cigars . " Take ! " she would say , laughing at his bashfulness , " take ! " But when her brother forced the cigars into his hands Joe would get red , and at last to satisfy them he would take and smoke one . Even at meals he would always say " No thanks " when a dish was offered him ; they would have to put the food on his plate . At last when the two of them had been going out steady and things were understood between them she made herself talk to him of this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you something we want you should take , with both hands , do n't be bashful ! Or is it that you do not like to have things from us ? " No , no , he had tried to explain , but it had been so hard for him to explain : it was only that all his life he had had to sweat for everything he needed , and so it was only when he got something after sweating hard for it that he knew the thing was his own , justly earned , that was all . But if a man had no job surely he had a right to live , to eat the food that was put before him ! " Joe , " she said . He turned away . " What is the matter , Joe ? " she said . That was all she could say , his name , when she wanted to tell him she knew what was the matter  | and to explain in some way to him that those things like having jobs and not having jobs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were small against everything else that should live between them . " Take , take ! " She wanted to lay herself abundantly before him , to bare herself now with him so he would know there was a richness of things in her he had not yet tasted , an endless richness of things in her to make up for the poverty outside . Now , because they were in trouble . But he too must make a sign . Why did he not show her that what she wanted to give was good , that he desired what she would give ? Standing before him , she would say , " It is not yet too late , for me . " Did she have to tell him ? Job or no job , this much was left for them : to be together . Now was no time to give up that last thing . What if a man planted wheat and no rain fell and the grain did not grow , should he run to his master and say , " Eat my flesh ! I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to him , " See , I am the woman . It is the woman , and not the job , that makes you a man . " Did he have to run away into himself feeling because he had no job he could not be a man to her ?  | All this she could not say to him . She could only say , " What 's the matter , Joe ? " And he , knowing what she meant , could only answer , " Huh ? " He dared not look to her . In his mind there was a remembrance of a story one of the men had told about a prisoner who was going to be executed . The whole flavor of the story-telling came over him now : how he might be sitting with Dominic and Stanley somewhere on a job , sitting on some planks of a scaffolding unwrapping sandwiches for lunch , thick cheese sandwiches that Anna had wrapped in yesterday 's American . " Say , then this fellow , they were going to hang him the next day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You got a right to get anything you want today , you say anything you want to eat this last night and we bring it to you , or anything you want . Then he says to them , You mean that ? And they say , Sure , anything you can have in here , we bring it to you . Then he says , I ask you for something , you bring it to me ? And they say , Sure , what ? So he says , Well , then I ask you for one thing I want for this be the last time . Then he says , You bring me a old lady for to-night ! " How the men had all burst out howling with  | laughter at the story of the one thing the prisoner wanted before he died ! " Sure , he got the right to ask for that . So they bring him one , right in the jail . " Sure , he got the right for that . Joe wanted to explain to Anna not so much the joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old lady that had come to the man in jail , the man that was going to hang the next day , early in the morning , right after he got through with her . Suddenly he pictured Anna in jail with him . She would have come . But better when he could come to her with nine dollars a day earned in his pockets ; sure , he had never minded when she put her hands in his pockets and took out the money , not waiting like some women did for when the man slept and his pants were hanging on a chair . That was when she was younger . She had had that little trick , and coming home he would put money in all his pockets for her to find . But after they were settled down and after a couple of years it was no joke any more to play around like that . Then he was one of the men that turned over his payroll to the old lady , and got his carfare every day from her . " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | looking at her as she was turned away now ; " I never went after no chickens . " She was not beautiful . Her face was solid like the face of a man , her neck was short , and her hands were big almost as his own . Sure there had been times when he had looked at other women , but always he had brought his want of the other women home to Anna . Especially when he was much younger there had been times when in the midst of lying with her he had made off to himself that he was lying with some other woman , some beautiful woman he had seen , and then he had been ashamed of betraying her that way in his thoughts , though she could never know ; and he had driven his love hotly upon her at such times , to make up to her for his wayward thoughts , or still as if she were the other beautiful woman of his thoughts , until in confusion he did not know which of them was there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes looking at their daughter Marie he thought it was out of such a wild night that Marie had been born , because she was a beautiful young girl . A man like himself should be afraid to have a beautiful woman . When he looked at the janitor 's wife , it came over him as something strange that the janitor , Stanley Dobrowsky , a man like  | himself , should not be afraid to have so beautiful a woman . How had she come to him ? Where had he found her ? With her great eyes , and her many children near her , she was so quiet and dark like a lake at night . Never even in those better times when they had first moved into this place had Joe Joracek dared bring that beautiful woman in his thoughts to Anna 's arms . " Wait now , " Anna said . " Marie is bringing the coffee . " Plenty of hours , these nights these last months he had lain beside her wanting her , and knowing it would be all right if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in the moment that he made up his will to turn for her , he felt a dizziness of shame and fear , then his strength went down within him . That was not because of anything that came from Anna ; Anna was good to him , so much he knew , she would let him have anything of her that she could give . She was not so old but that he knew she was there , they had plenty left in them yet , the two of them , and she was strong , he could feel her stronger than in the youngest days ; she had been soft then and he had had to watch out with her , but soon she became strong in love , sometimes he thought stronger than himself . That was what he was afraid of  | now , afraid he did n't have the man 's blood to come and take her as a wild rider snatches a woman off the field . He lay there often in terror that she would reach out after him ; if that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like to run away ; such a thing would be worse than this of having her be the one to find out where to get food to feed them , all these months . WHEN Marie went out with her coffee , Red slammed back into the room and said , " Hell ! " He began pulling on his shirt , all the time fouling out a string of blazing bastards and sons-of-bitches long enough to curse an army through a war . Ida Feingold heard him working himself up like that ; it sounded almost like her husband was in the house again , like he used to swear when he came home from losing his last nickel in a poker game . She listened , knowing Red 's every movement : now he had his jersey over his head , now he was tearing at his belt-buckle , now he had on a shoe . But when she heard him blasting for the door she stopped him . " Hey , Red , you did n't eat ! "  | " I 'm going ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya think you 're going ? " " I 'm gon na get the gang . " " Yah ? Well , wait a minute . " He had been stalling for her to stop him . " They 're throwing them out , " he said . " Who ? When ? " " To-day . " He stood in the bedroom doorway . " For cry sake ! " she said , getting up on her elbow . " I 'll show ' em , " said Red . " I 'll get the gang ! " " Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Not so fast . " She knocked back her hair that was short and clumped like bunches of withered grapes . " You lemme take care of this . " " For cry sake , " he said , " half the house is empty . What 's the use of throwing them out ! " " He ai n't worked since Dempsey was a prizefighter , " said Ida Feingold . " I guess they must be pretty far behind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if the house is empty they might as well let some one live in it . " " If I do n't sell any papers d' ya think I 'm gon na give ' em away ? D' ya think Simon Marks is putting up houses for charity ? " she said . " Aw who the hell is Simon Marks ! " He kicked  | the imitation wood bedstead . " I 'll tell that guy where he gets off at . Putting up a lot of houses and throwing people out of them . " " Yah go tell him , " she said . " You do n't even know where he lives . " " I 'll look it up in the phone book , " he muttered . But already his plan fizzled . Saying it in front of her made him feel like a hot-headed kid . That was a dead end way of trying to get out of the hole : going to look up a name to talk to . Red stood confused , trying to get back the wild sureness he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to get the gang ; but what would he do with the gang when they came ? " Listen , " Ida pulled her legs from under the covers . " You sit down and eat your breakfast . I 'm going in there and talk to those Polacks . " He went back into the other room . He did n't like to watch the old lady mussing around with her clothes . When she got out of bed her face was pasty sick . She wore a thin pink nightgown that looked like it never belonged on her ; she was pretty big on top , and her bare crooked toes and her short skinny legs sticking out of that pink nightgown gave him a rotten feeling as if he was in the wrong place . When she got on her clothes she looked like she had some life in her .  | While his mother was still in the bedroom , he said easily as though it was just a hunch he got as he bit the raisin-roll , " I 'll tell you what , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room in here until they get set . " She got his idea right away . Just like that , from another room , Julius used to pop out with the things he was ashamed to say to her face . She watched the back of his head . Then she knew how she would handle this . " Are you crazy ? " she said . " Well , jeez ? " " Where would they stay ? " " I 'll go sleep somewhere else , " he blurted . " Marie can have my bed . " Ida had to laugh . She came and stood in the doorway . The back of his neck was getting redder all the time . " Ahah , " she said . " Well , what the hell you ca n't let a kid like that get chucked out on the street . Anything might happen to her . " " She 's got a mother and a father , " said Ida . " Yah , a lot of good that is . " Instead of a dressing gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look like an old lady with skinny legs any more , she had a way of belting on a coat that made her look tough as a cossack .  | Her feet were easy in a pair of men 's shoes that she wore around the house . They were patent-leather shoes her husband had left ; he was a natty dresser . " Go on , dress up ! " he would always be after her . " Do n't slop around the house . " And she would scream , " That 's all you got to worry about , clothes ! If I was a man I 'd worry about paying some bills once in a while ! " But you had to say this for him , when he made a pot he was easy with his money . That was just like him , not even coming back for his clothes , he must have had to buy a complete new wardrobe . She shut him out of her head ; marched across the hall to talk with the Joraceks . Joe Joracek was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , Mrs. Joracek ? " Ida said . " They coming after you to-day ? " " Yah , " said Anna . " I guess they come to-day . " Joe put down his cup . Anna opened the drawer of the kitchen table and took out a folded sheet of paper . " Lessee , " said Ida . But she did not bother to read the notice . " Listen , " she said , " how much you owe those bastards ? " " Three months , " Anna said . Joe sunk lower  | in his chair , as if they were talking bad things about him . " Ninety bucks , " said Ida . These blood-sucking landlords , if you gave them a couple of nickels sometimes they let you go on living . She was thinking maybe she and the other neighbors could get together a little money . But three months was a lot . " You ai n't had a job for a long time , " she said to Joe . He did n't answer . Marie said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last job was up here . We moved in the first house that was finished . " " Huh ? " said Ida . " You worked on these houses ? " " Yah , that was the last job , " Anna said . Now it was as if a handle had been put to the whole problem for Ida . She felt something coming inside her besides pity for these poor dumb Polacks . Their trouble was swinging around into a new light , where she could see better . " You got a claim ! " she wanted to say , " You got a claim ! " Her question seemed to have lifted Joe Joracek out of his deadness . " Yah , I worked on all these houses , " he said . " This house too ? "  | " Sure , this house too . The Simon Marks company , they built them . " " You built this house ! " Ida Feingold cried , " and now they want to throw you out of it ! " Her words seemed true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a glass of water and then rises slowly spreading upward until it has colored all the water in the glass , the truth of her words took possession of him . What if he might not be sure he worked on this very house ? The houses were all alike , one to another . Trudging under the front or the rear end of a plank , that was a job , that was building a house . Beginning among some stumbly holes , among piles of sand and gravel that had to be shoveled from one spot to another , going through mazes of scaffolding carrying pipes here and planks there , never being able to understand how those smart engineers would remember to leave holes in the walls for the electric wires , the gas pipes , the water pipes , the plugs , the faucets , at last coming to the day when they said to clear away this framework , to take away those ladders , and then finding the finished house standing inside the maze he had been treading ! Now as Ida Feingold spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had raised them entirely  | with his own two hands ; this house especially : he had dug out every spadeful of dirt for the foundation , he had mixed the cement and poured the basement walls , he had handled every brick in the building , hammered every nail in the lath , he had laid on the plaster with his own hands , he had sawn the wood of the stairs , he had made this house and brought his wife and child to live in it , and now they were throwing him out . " They ca n't do it ! " Ida Feingold said . " They ca n't throw you out of the house ! You worked on it yourself ! " " What can we do ? " said Anna , putting new creases in the piece of paper . " Do ? " Now Ida 's loud battle voice was roused . " We 'll show those bastards if they can throw you out ! When are they coming ? " Anna did n't know . " To-day , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ida . " All right ! " She pushed the coat-sleeves up from her wrists . " We 'll be ready for them ! " And she strode to the door . " What do you mean ? " cried Anna . " What do you want to do ? " " Never mind . " Even at that moment Ida did not know just what she would do . All she knew was that her blood was up . She felt almost as mad  | as she had felt that time when she grabbed the stick and let the three chiselers have it in the eye . She would do something . She would get the rest of the neighbors and do something . That was the ideal " You wait here , " she ordered . " Do n't let nobody in . I 'll be back in a minute . " FIRST thing , instead of going to neighbors on the same floor , Ida went downstairs to Mrs. Pincus . Maybe because she wanted to talk Yiddish to somebody . Besides , Mrs. Pincus knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's union called out a cap-makers ' strike . She would understand what had to be done to help these poor Polacks who had stuffed heads themselves and did n't know their toes from a hole in the ground . This week there was no strike , so Mr. Pincus was already gone to work . It was a good thing he was out of the house , Ida felt , because he might stand in the way of action . He was a very gentle kind of man , a pacifist , an idealist : he always wanted to talk things over before doing something . Like he advised her when she wanted to get the police after her husband : Think first , then  | act . What was the use , Ida said , in the end you had to take action anyway , and all that time wasted . No , Mr. Pincus would n't raise a finger against a fly ; but for that matter Mrs. Feingold always said she would n't go chasing a fly herself if it was minding its own business on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a different thing . This week , Mrs. Pincus had her sister staying with her . Otherwise the whole thing might have fallen out differently . It was strange about those two sisters : even after they were married women with husbands and children to care for , Mrs. Feldscher would leave everything and come to stay with Bertha Pincus for a week at a time . There was an old yellow wrapper that she had once loaned to her sister . " My favorite wrapper , " she called it . Each time she came for a visit she put it on over her dress and wore it all week , saying , " I must remember to take this home . " But she always forgot . Would you think she enjoyed her visits ? No . Mrs. Feldscher was sour every minute , crabbing about how small the place was , worrying how her children would get along without her at home , bossing her sister , telling her what to cook and keeping her from eating so she would get a little  | thinner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two sisters slept in the big bed . All their lives Celia Feldscher had bossed her sister Bertha Pincus . Bertha did not mind . It was as if some one else was helping to carry her two hundred and fifty pounds of flesh , that was such a job to lug around . As a girl she had weighed much less , almost a hundred pounds less , but only because Celia had always kept jumping at her , " Do n't eat so much , do n't eat so much , reduce , reduce , how do you think you 'll ever get a husband ! Do n't eat so much , reduce ! " The burden of her flesh had been all that Bertha could bear . To think about things , to make decisions like what movie to see , what dress to wear , what food to eat , had been a horrible torment to her . All life somehow had seemed a dark trap to her , where she lay roped in coils of heavy flesh . Always , Celia warned her of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to spend on trashy movies . Do you know there are people that have no food to eat ? " " What if he is a shrimp , be nice to him , how will you live if you do n't get a husband at all ? " The need to make the slightest decision threw Bertha into a turmoil of fear . Suppose Celia would not like it ?  | She had come to feel Celia as the bones of herself , the hard solid fibers that somehow drew together and held up the loose flowing flesh of her body . When the time came for marriage , Celia had been so busy watching out for a husband for Bertha that she had violated the rule that an older sister should marry first , neglecting to get a husband for herself until she had found little Mr. Pincus and brought him to Bertha . When at last the smiling , gentle , steady Mr. Pincus asked her to marry him , Bertha told him to wait a day for his answer . And as soon as he was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wants to marry me , what shall I do ? " " If you want to marry him then marry him ! " Celia said . And at once Bertha felt a tremendous load lifted from her , the decision was made . And she began to eat chocolates right away . After that , living without her sister , she was like a figure without corsets . She was like a body of water flowing easily into a new wide valley . But occasionally , for a few days , for a week , Celia would come , rushing to build walls , to fill swamps , to keep the water within some boundaries . Bertha never went to stay with Celia . In the beginning after their marriages she had gone to visit Celia . There she had met the husband , a  | strange man with thin lips and a high forehead , a stranger to whom she found it hard to talk . And yet , while visiting her sister and that husband , she had been dumbfounded by a feeling that these two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood and pursued life , and were therefore far different and superior to herself ; they were of a higher race of beings . She could only catch from them the feeling that life was something brutal and evil ; they were smart enough to see small footholds where they might stand and fight against it , however hopelessly , but she was one of the dumb beings who could only lie oppressed under the terror of life . In the face of that strange husband , Bertha had been troubled with the suspicion that her sister was not the same person she had always known , but some one with vast reaches of darker wisdom . Here was a man , a family , with whom her sister lived in utter familiarity , but whose ways were entirely strange to Bertha . Could her sister who had all those unknown qualities still be the same sister she felt so close to herself ? A fear came over Bertha when she went to that house , a sickening sense of betrayal , a ghastly bonelessness and yet a yearning for freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a person who has always worn dark glasses . One day the glasses are taken away . A strange world , hazy with light , sways impalpable before the weak eyes . She seems to float with a continual dizziness among weightless objects that seem suspended in the air ; she is continually afraid she will overturn and break these weightless forms that have taken the place of the solid dark world she knew . But sometimes , for an instant , her eyes have a hint of new strength , a cool atmosphere settles the swaying world about her into something like solidity , and in those instants she is thrilled with a wild sense of the existence , the beauty of light . In those flashes she feels that the world does not live only in darkness , she feels the truth of her old intuition that something like this existed , something about which she had never been told . But the moment passes , leaving her more than ever unbalanced , astray , in need of the shade of the dark glasses . So , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly that the world was harsh , evil , bitter , that people never got what they wanted , that the way to live was by always being ready for unhappiness . When Ida burst into their kitchen after having given one quick knock and opened the door for  | herself , she saw that Mrs. Pincus 's sister was there , so instead of coming right out with the trouble she had to say , " How are you ? " to Mrs. Feldscher . Then she had to ask about her five-year-old son , who was going to be a violin prodigy . " In another year his teacher says he can give a concert , " reported Mrs. Feldscher . " But I am against it . " " Well , some people get all the breaks , " said Mrs. Feingold , " and some people get all the broken necks . " " Yah , " said Mrs. Pincus , sighing for the ones that got the broken necks ; like herself for instance , what did she get out of life ? With her two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in a day to get out into the street once and up into the house again ; often she had tried to eat less and grow thinner , but after all what do you get out of life if you stop eating ? " And your boy ? " said Mrs. Feldscher to Ida , " what is he going to be ? " That hit Ida . A boy had to be a doctor or a lawyer or a musical genius or something . But with Red it was no use . He had his father 's dumb ox blood in him . The best that could be hoped was that some good girl would get ahold of him and that he would want her enough to get a job and  | keep straight and not go gambling like his old man , but ten to one if he ever did get married he 'd walk out on his wife some day . " He 'll probably be a jailbird , " she said to Mrs. Feldscher , and before they could begin asking questions about little Oscar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got to help me with those dumb Polacks , the Joraceks . " " Yah ? They got nothing to eat ? " said Bertha Pincus , and she was already thinking what she could spare out of her icebox . " First they shut off their lights , " said Ida , " and then they shut off their gas . You know for three weeks she 's been cooking on my stove  --  when she got anything to cook . Well , that 's all right with me , so it costs me a couple of cents gas . But to-day is the finish . Outside . On the street . " " No ! " said Mrs. Pincus . " They would n't throw them out ! " That 's the way she was , an idealist like her husband ; she could n't believe people would do things like that no matter how often she had seen them done . She picked strands of damp hair off her cheek . " Half the house is empty anyway ! " said Ida . " If the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feldscher , " things like that would n't  | happen . " She quickly shut her mouth , and made idle circles on the table with the sugar-bowl . " Well , they ai n't gon na put them out , " said Ida Feingold . " We wo n't let them . " " We ? What can we do ? " said Mrs. Pincus . " The masses are unorganized , " said Mrs. Feldscher in her quick rattly way , " and the capitalist holds the whip . " " All right ! " said Ida . " Then we get organized . That 's what I came here for ! You got to help , Mrs. Pincus ! You know how to work such things ! " " I ? " said Bertha Pincus . " Me ? " " Listen ! " cried Ida . " Joracek built this house , he worked on this house with his own hands , and now they want to throw him out of it ! " Mrs. Pincus looked at her with slow understanding . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she looked to her sister . " You got to have a committee , " said Mrs. Feldscher impatiently . " Up in the Bronx they could n't get away with stuff like that . They all have committees . That 's what I heard . " " That 's it ! " Ida jumped to her . " Say , you just show us how to get started ? " " What ? I do n't know anything about it , " said Mrs. Feldscher . But she went on breathlessly , " All I know is when they come to throw out a  | neighbor some people in the house make a committee and they go on a strike , they say if they throw one out we all go out ! But I do n't know a thing about it ! " " Yah ? Well , what do they do ? How does it come off ? " said Ida . Mrs. Feldscher spoke as if of something that everybody knew . " Why , sometimes when the marshal comes to throw somebody out , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broom or anything , and then they just stand in the doorway and do n't let them in . That 's all I know . But you do n't have to take my word for it . " " That 's it ! " Ida had heard her own language spoken ! " We 'll give them a fight ! That 's it ! We 'll crown ' em ! " " But what is the use ? " said Mrs. Pincus . " They 'll call the police and put us in jail . " " There 's only one or two comes with the marshal to carry out the furniture , " said Mrs. Feldscher . " If you do n't let them in sometimes they go away and do n't bother any more . They 're just loafers on the payroll of the politicians , that 's all , they should worry what they do . I would never know a thing about it myself but somebody told me it happened in the next block . There were only half a dozen neighbors but they got together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was in the papers . Do n't take my word for it . " " Sure ! " said Ida . " We got to stick together . To-day they kick out the Polack , to-morrow we get the gate . What if your husband has to strike again and you ca n't pay the rent , Mrs. Pincus ? Then Mr. Simon Marks says out you go , and out you go ! " " The trouble is like my husband says , " murmured Mrs. Pincus . " You ca n't change human nature . " " The trouble is you got no organization . You got no leader ! " Mrs. Feldscher said . " All right ! " cried Ida . " You got a broom , have n't you ! " She seized the broom that was standing against the gas stove , and handed it to Mrs. Pincus . " You be ready ! " she commanded . " I 'll knock on the radiator , see . Three knocks . Then you grab the broom and rush out on the stairs in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ida started to go , but remembered Mrs. Feldscher . " You too , " she said . " You got to help us . You know the works . " " I ? What can I do ? " said Mrs. Feldscher . " I 'm not very strong . " " What do I have to do , do I have to fight them or what ? " said Mrs. Pincus . It was like when her  | husband brought her to the street in front of the cap-making shop , to march back and forth on picket duty . If she was told to do a thing , that made it easy , she just had to do as she was told . Principles and ideals you could have , but what you had to do you had to do . " You stop them with that broom . Do n't let them get up the stairs , see ! " Ida could picture Mrs. Pincus standing at the top of the stairs , her broad body blocking the passage like a cork in a bottle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to do yet , " Ida said . " Now remember , when I knock on the radiator ! " And she grabbed Mrs. Pincus 's thick fingers and gave them a quick military squeeze . Mrs. Pincus , a little dazed , let her hand be shaken . " We got to have organization , " she mumbled , holding the broom in front of her . Then she sighed a little because there was so much wrong in the world . Then she began to sweep the room . As she swept , she became more cheerful . It would be sociable , like when she was on picket duty with all the other wives of the cap-makers . As she swept , her sister told her she was crazy to let that crazy woman talk her into a crazy thing like that but if she thought it was the right thing to do then she ought to do it .  | " Listen , " said Mrs. Pincus , " I 'll bet those Joraceks have n't had a square meal since Christmas . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batter ready , so she began to fry potato pancakes . Mrs. Feldscher decided she had better stand in the doorway when the trouble began , or God knows what would happen to these fools . IDA FEINGOLD went back at once to the Joraceks . " It 's all right ! " she said . " The whole house is with you ! All you got to do is sit tight ! Now I got to talk to Mrs. Smiley . " She was rushing off again , but Anna stopped her with questions . Then Ida explained about watching through the window , and knocking three times on the radiator . " It 's all right . That 's the way they do in the Bronx . Mrs. Pincus 's sister , you know , Mrs. Feldscher , the one that has the boy the musical genius , well , they tried to throw her out and the neighbors all got together and showed them where they get off . Listen , you got a gun in the house ? " This was the word that reached Joracek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists that waved like the arms of a jewelry auction salesman , all these had knotted him into a sweaty confusion like  | he sometimes got on a job when a new foreman came to him with a bunch of blue sheets of paper and started giving him orders and showing him white lines on the dark papers . He would have to wait , letting the foreman go on talking , until at last the foreman walked with him over to a pile of lumber and said , " Here , " and then walked with him to another spot where digging was going on and said , " Right there . " That he understood . So the word " gun " had suddenly brought him to the point of understanding Ida Feingold . He rose up . " No ! no ! such things we do n't do ! " and shaking his head with finality , he sat down again . " Well , that 's all right , " said Ida . She looked at him now , admitting him as some one whose word belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're right . That might be kind of dangerous . If you do n't have no cannons you do n't do no shooting . Yah , I 'll tell them . No cannons . Brooms , baseball bats , that 's all right . Y'got a bat ? " She looked anxiously at him . Her question was more than for a bat . It was would he stick . Would he go through with the thing . Now she had forgotten how the fight started . Now she had forgotten whose was the cause . She was in it now . She would carry it all the way through . Even if the Joraceks were not with her she would go through . That 's the way it was ,  | sometimes you had to force people to do things for their own good . He was silent . He had said what he had to say about the guns . The rest was no matter . Whatever they wanted to do , let them do . " Well , Red has a couple of bats in the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was out the door . " I 've got to talk to Mrs. Smiley , too . " The minute Ida was gone , Anna Joracek turned on Marie . " You go to school . What you standing here for ? " Marie picked up her books but did not go . " I do n't know where to come back , " she said . " You come back to Mrs. Feingold if we ai n't here . She 'll know where we are . " Marie stood there holding her books , she let tears run out of her eyes . " Oh , shut up , " said Anna . The girl wrinkled her face holding back a sob . It was all so cheap . Fighting with people . That 's what she was crying about . It made her father and her mother and everybody seem so cheap . And herself , too . They were going to stand on the stairs and fight with policemen . Their clothes would be torn , their hair would be wild , they would have scratches on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jail ; then all the kids in  | school would know that her father and mother were in jail . Instead of going to school she would walk straight across the bridge and keep on walking down some street where nobody would know her . If a man offered her a ride in an automobile she would go . She would become a bum like that dirty Josie . " Maybe let her stay home to-day , " Joe said to Anna . Just then Red Feingold came in with his arms full of baseball bats that stuck out on all sides of him like guns on a warship . One of the clubs was wound with tape for a steady grip . Red dumped the other clubs on the table , but swung the taped bat in a slow high arc . " That 's a wicked baby . Knock their blocks off ! " He whirled clean around , with the bat stuck out in front of him , so you could just see it slicing off a whole row of policemen 's heads . " Want this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Red held out the bat . Joracek stared unblinking at the boy . Then Red dropped the first bat and picked up another one , which he balanced on his palm . " This stick 's a little lighter , " he said , " but it sure can crack them out . " " That 's all right , " said Anna Joracek.  | What did she mean ? That he should go ? Christ , they were a funny bunch of Polacks . Maybe they were scared . Maybe they were hungry , Maybe he 'd act funny too if he did n't know where he was gon na sleep that night , and not a nickel in his pocket . " Sure , " he said , and left the bat with the taped handle lying on their table , near Joracek . He took a look at Marie as he was going out . She looked sort of blue . He wanted to put his arm around her and take her away some place . " Haya , babe ? " he said , waved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rest of that floor stood vacant . She felt lonely up there ; lonesome most of the day alone . Having the baby did not help . The first year she used to tell her big husband , Charlie , how lonely she felt when he went away to his job , then he always laughed and said , " Wait till I lose my job , kid , and come home and sit around the house all day . Maybe you 'll like that better ! " She used to kid him back and say , " Sure I would ! " and rough his hair . He was young to be a street car conductor , you never saw them so jolly and young . She used to sit there alone and think of him flirting with other girls  | that asked him crazy questions about how to get downtown , just as he had flirted with her . First after they got married she would go out to his line and wait on a corner till his car came , she would climb aboard and pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would flirt all over again , she would ask him where to get off for Africa . But after a while he said the other men razzed him on account of her riding on his car . Sitting alone in the house she suddenly wondered was that why he had wanted to move way out here not minding the daily walk across the long bridge for himself ? Just to stick her out of the way ? No ! Not Charlie . She had thought after the baby came she would be less lonely . But strangely it was just the same . Long hours in the afternoons , after the man 's air of him had faded out of the house and out of herself , she would sit struggling with a terrible want that she could feel right under her breast . She wanted a man around the house . Terribly sometimes there came to her the feeling that it did n't even have to be Charlie , it could be some other man . And she shrank from the thought of herself as one of that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want inside herself to do  | things she was ashamed to think of other women doing . Just like she had got right up and flirted with Charlie that first time on the street car , and given him her telephone number . She was tired of being so young , even having the baby did not make her feel older . She would like to know better the other women in the house . But the only one she felt she knew warmly was Mrs. Dobrowsky , the wife of the janitor ; they lived in the basement four houses away . Sometimes she even wished Charlie was a janitor , that would keep him around the house all the time , coming in and out , that would save her from the terrible feeling about other men . Or , if they lived away somewhere on a farm , where she would be a smiling little busy wife , and he would come tramping into the house every hour or so , bringing the smell of the fields into the house with him . Was it having her man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blooming , so beautiful ? She was like a cake with a perfect brownish crust just taken out of the oven . Was it because she had so many children she seemed so ripe in her life ? Five , six little children , yet she never seemed cluttered with them . Was it because she was religious , a Catholic ? It seemed so strange , a  | janitor 's wife , living with all those kids in four rooms in a basement , and yet so beautiful . " How are you ? How is your husband ? " she and Mrs. Dobrowsky would say to each other when they met on the sidewalk , never much more . And yet she felt if she were in deep trouble that was the only woman who could help her . She felt if she had another baby she would like to have Mrs. Dobrowsky by her side at the birth . Maybe then it would be a boy . If there were people living on her own floor maybe she would get to know them , maybe they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors . Now this morning she could tell there was something going on in the building . She counted the number of times the doors slammed : Mrs. Feingold was going in and out every minute . Usually Mrs. Feingold was asleep at this hour . That was what made Tillie Novak feel especially unimportant : there were times when she knew that something was going on , that people were doing things together , and she felt she was the only one being left out . Before she was married she had worked in a big office where there were lots of girls , and sometimes she would see Mary Blake going from one to another , plotting  | something , maybe it was a party or an excursion , and Tillie would be terribly afraid they would leave her out ! Often Mary Blake got around to her , almost always the last , sometimes she imagined one of the girls spoke to Mary Blake and pointed her out saying it would be unkind to ditch her , and then Tillie blushed to herself and made up her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and ask her , she would pretend she had something else to do . But when Mary Blake came it would turn out she was taking up a collection to buy a vanity set for one of the girls that was getting engaged , and Tillie would quickly open her purse and give a dollar , as much as any one else gave . But she was sure there were lots of times they had parties and did n't ask her , that was because she was so quiet , not much fun , well , she could n't help that . Maybe , in the end , that was why she had to flirt with a street car conductor to get a husband , when so many of the girls got husbands right in the office or at parties . But when those thoughts came , Tillie would be mad at herself , because Charlie was a swell fellow and she would have loved him anywhere she met him , it was a case of love at first sight . She heard Mrs. Pincus 's door close . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard a snatch of words in Mrs. Feingold 's banging voice . For a while she sat waiting patiently , her small hands locked together . She had shut off the radio so she could hear anything that was said in the hallway . At last she got up and opened her door and stood right behind the door listening . The hallway had become quiet . It was quiet for what seemed a terribly long time . But , all the same , she could feel something going on , feel an excitement all through the house , as if , she would tell Charlie later , as if she were standing on top of a volcano that she could feel boiling under her feet ! Then suddenly a door slammed  --  it sounded like Mrs. Smiley 's  --  and Ida Feingold marched down the hallway saying , " Well , I 'll be a son of a gun ! " And then Ida Feingold 's door slammed . Tillie Novak could n't bear the suspense any longer . She put on her coat , took her pocketbook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery . Maybe she would meet one of them in the hallway and they would tell her what was happening . Or , she could take something in to Mrs. Joracek , like Mrs. Pincus was always doing ; but , after all , she had never talked much to Mrs. Joracek and  | maybe Mrs. Joracek would feel insulted at having food brought to her like to a beggar . Tillie walked halfway down the stairs . She could stand there as if she had stopped , trying to remember something she had to take with her . In case somebody came up the stairs and caught her standing there she could make a sign of having suddenly remembered , and run back to fetch an empty cream bottle . But long as she stood , all she could hear was Mrs. Smiley 's radio . Tillie Novak was funny with radios . She could never get interested in listening to her own , but the minute somebody else put on a program she could sit and listen , trying to make out what it was , for through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was interesting trying to put the meaning together if you missed a couple of words ; sometimes , if it was low music , it seemed the tune had stopped altogether , and then you listened hard , waiting , wondering if it had ended or if it would start again . And then the song picked up again , like a swimmer who goes under water and is n't seen until his head comes up way out somewhere in another direction entirely . Now the radio was playing Minnie the Moocher , that was a crazy song .  | Minnie had a heart as big as a whale . It always made Charlie bang out with great laughter ; maybe the men knew a dirty meaning to those words . Tillie Novak was standing there on the stairs timidly trying to hum the second part of the chorus , Haad- eee-haaa- cha-chaa , when suddenly , in panic , she realized that Ida Feingold had come out again and was heading up the stairs ! Tillie Novak rushed back to her door , and was fumbling with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Novak ! " IDA FEINGOLD had just been to see Mrs. Smiley . If her blood had been up before , it was boiling now . She could feel it seething in her teeth . So that 's the way people were . So that 's the way they stuck together and helped each other when there was trouble . No wonder some louse like Simon Marks could come along and walk all over them . That 's all they deserved . Mrs. Smiley was getting aid . Everybody knew that . Her husband got fifteen dollars a week for working three days a week on some fake job that was as useful as curling a dog 's tail . Mrs. Smiley was just in the same class as those poor dumb  | Polacks , the Joraceks , and a fine one she was to stick herself up as better than them . " They can go and do as I did , " she said . " Let them apply for aid . " Sure , if Anna Joracek would go and lick somebody 's boots maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fine little smile . Sure . Ida knew . Anna had gone three times , a dozen times , and filled out God knows how many blanks . Ida felt as mad as if she herself had gone there and stood hours in line and been told to come back next Tuesday or been told to wait until her name came up in alphabetical order or been told to go and get a certificate from somebody or been told to wait until an investigator came to investigate . Fifteen dollars a week , Mr. Smiley was getting , and all he had to do was go to Belleview hospital and push invalid chairs around for a couple of hours a day three days in the week . He was learning all about hospitals , he said , and taking the opportunity to improve his mind , and if he was a couple of years younger , darned if he would n't drop everything and study medicine . He was getting to know the interrres and doctors , sure , he would , that oily little mutt , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a steady job as an orderly .  | " If my husband can do that , there is no reason why somebody else ca n't , " said Mrs. Smiley . " I have told them many times to go to the proper social agency . There is no need for disorderly conduct . " " You ai n't got any guts , " Ida had said to her . " Oh , I have n't ! " said Mrs. Smiley . " Well , I know enough to mind my own business . " " Yah , " said Mrs. Feingold . " You 're yellow . You 're scared . You 're afraid if you stand up for your rights they 'll take that little hand-out away from you . That 's what you 're afraid of ! " " All right then , " said Mrs. Smiley , her little eyes blazing , and her mouth screwed tight . " All right . That 's what I 'm afraid of . All right . I 'm yellow . Sure I 'm yellow . Now , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her radio . " Rats ! " said Ida Feingold . And slammed the door . Minnie had a heart as big as a whale .... Mrs. Smiley sank trembling into a chair . She had stuck it out all right in the face of that bloody Mrs. Feingold , but really she was so scared she felt her insides must be white as paste . Now what should she do ? Maybe she ought to phone the police and warn them that there was going to be a revolution when they came to evict Mrs. Joracek.  | Maybe she would get a reward for warning the government ! But if that terrible Mrs. Feingold ever found out she had snitched ! There was nothing you could put past a crazy woman like that . And the wild boy she had ! Mrs. Smiley could already feel Mrs. Feingold creeping up behind her with a butcher knife . Still , if the police put them all in jail , and gave Mr. Smiley a full-time job as reward for the warning ? ? No . Mr. Smiley had said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in this world . Just tend to number one . Mind your own business and let the next fellow mind his own business and everything will be okay . If you see trouble coming the best thing is to just step right out of its path . " And that was what she would do . She would just put on her hat and coat and go for a walk . Or go visit somebody . Go visit her aunt in Brooklyn . That would take all day and when she came back the Joraceks would be cleared out and Mrs. Feingold would be in jail and that 's all there would be to it . Back and forth the thoughts scurried in her mind , like mice in a cage . But she sat there frozen in her chair , and did nothing . Every moment she expected the sound of machine guns to burst along  | the hallway . She wondered if the bullets would come through the wall and kill her ? The outer door slammed . She jerked in her chair . No , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could tell him ! He was responsible to see that everything was in order ! Yet she held back . That dumb foreigner would never understand what she was trying to tell him . His head was so thick ! He would listen to her while all the time his sleepy dog 's eyes looked in her face . He would be thinking she was not so beautiful as his wife . He would stand there stupidly silent , his great arms hanging , sleepy , loose , as if he had just crawled out of bed where that sexy woman was waiting for him to return . It was like slime , hot slime , the way those two lay in their basement and spawned out children . It made Mrs. Smiley shudder across her tight flat chest . The dumb brute he was . Stupid . Even a little thing like collecting garbage . Instead of going to the top of the house with his empty bushel-basket and dumping the pails into it as he came down , he started dumping pails at the bottom , carrying all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Smiley had called her attention to the stupidity of that procedure .  | She sat still , waiting for him to get away from her door . THAT Smiley woman was what Ida had left when she came spluttering up the stairs to talk to Mrs. Novak . Her mouth felt full of poison , she wanted to spew out what had happened in words smothered with curses . But even while she was climbing that flight of stairs , Ida got hold of herself . No sense in scaring that rabbit little Mrs. Novak . Telling her some one else backed down would just give her the idea to back down . " Oh , hello , how are you this morning ? " Mrs. Novak breathlessly greeted Ida as she reached the top floor . " You know I was just going out for some cream and I forgot to take the bottle , " and she giggled . That was the way with her , giggling about everything . Just a kid . Ida Feingold sized her up . Though she gave the impression of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to size her up . Maybe she would be some use , but not much use , Ida figured . Probably get scared and faint in the middle of the scrap . " Listen , " said Ida , " you grab ahold of a hammer or a mop handle or something , and when you  | hear me knock three times on the radiator , you come dashing downstairs and meet me on our floor , see ? " Tillie Novak stared at her . It was just as if Ida Feingold had come upstairs , put a lion in her arms , and said , " Here , nurse him . " But in a way it was good that nothing was explained . It made her feel she was one of them , no questions asked . " What are you looking at ? " said Ida . " They 're going to throw out the Joraceks to-day , and we 're going to stop them , that 's all . " " Oh , " said Mrs. Novak . " Oh . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hurt . There 'll be a whole bunch of us , see , and we 'll just scare the pants off them . Now do n't forget , when I knock on the radiator , three times . " And she went clattering down the stairs . Tillie Novak watched after her with the feeling that she ought to salute . Then she went into the house to search for the hammer . All the neighbors were going to be in this thing so it must be all right . She would stand near Mrs. Dobrowsky . But no , Mrs. Dobrowsky could not help them because she was the wife of the superintendent and would have to be neutral . Then Tillie Novak felt a scare . Would this thing count against Mr. Dobrowsky ? Would there be a chance of his losing his job ?  | She 'd better find out before  --  No , they could n't do anything like that ! She found Charlie 's tools in a box wedged between the bathtub and the wall . There was a ten-cent-store hammer . It looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But hers could not be separated from the mop , and she would look funny carrying out a mop for a weapon . Then she had an idea . She could soak the mop dripping wet and slosh it at them . She wondered if she ought to ask Ida Feingold if that would be a good way to scare them . She could see herself swinging the wet end of the mop into the face of some skinny little man who held a bunch of eviction papers , getting his face all wet and his collar wet and the papers wet and knocking his hat off . She had to sit down and laugh , it was such a funny idea . STANLEY DOBROWSKY grunted as he lifted the pail from Mrs. Smiley 's door . There was quiet to-day . All the doors were closed . He shouldered his basket . He would sweep the stairs to-morrow . It did not pay to work too hard . Better sit a while in the house , to eat . Better if they had a flat upstairs , not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty upstairs flats vacant . Soon  | would be another , the Joraceks ' . Bad times , bad times , America . Three and forty maidens stood in a row . Yi-huppah ! He had to stand aside flat against the wall to let Mrs. Pincus pass . She was carrying something in a plate upstairs . It smelled good . " Why do n't you start at the top and come down ? " she said . It was an old joke between them . He smiled and said to her in Polish , " Upside down is a peasant 's head . " How could a man be with such a fat wife ? A mountain of flesh ! Two and forty maidens stood in a row Yi-yi-huppah ! Ayah ! Mrs. Feingold had not put out her garbage . He stood for a moment at her door . Should he knock and remind her ? Maybe she slept ; she worked hard , let her sleep . A woman without a man ! One and forty LITTLE Mrs. Novak waited for Dobrowsky 's slow feet to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to put a package of rubbish into her pail . " Hullo , " he said . She pleased him . She said in one breath , " Oh , Mr. Dubrowsky , I  | wanted to ask you something , you do n't have anything to do with the renting , I mean if people do n't pay their rent  --  " He looked with his warm puzzled eyes upon her . Her husband , too ? " You got no money ? " he said . He could pity her . She was not like other American women , she was warm . " No , no , not me , I mean the Joraceks , if they come to put them out , you do n't have to put them out , do you ? I mean  --  " " I do n't put nobody out , " he said stoutly . Then he smiled . " You want something to fix , I fix it , " he offered , putting his great hand on her arm . She pleased him . In terror she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand could do this to her ! " No , it 's all right , nothing , " she mumbled . She drew quickly behind her door . He heaved up his basket and went down the stairs . Yet she was glad she had spoken to him ; it made her feel easier . MRS . PINCUS came into the Joraceks ' flat and deposited the bowl of pancakes on the table . Seeing the baseball bat there she let out a big laugh .  | " That 's a good one , " she said . " Where did you get that ? " " Red brought it , " said Marie . " Sure , he would , " said Mrs. Pincus . " He 's got some more , if you want one , " said Marie . " That 's all he 's got in the head , baseball bats , " said Mrs. Pincus . " You would never believe it was a Jewish boy . I wonder if she ever thinks what will become of him ? " Joe Joracek began to eat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt easier about the whole business . It was like a fellowworkman coming on a job . " My nephew , " Mrs. Pincus was saying , " that 's my sister 's husband 's older boy  --  the younger one you know is going to be a musical genius  --  but the older boy , from her husband 's first marriage , is just the same size as Red Feingold , and he already has his heart set to be a chemical engineer . " She took one of the potato pancakes herself , and stood there eating while she talked . Marie ate one , in small bites . They were good . " He says , " Bertha Pincus went on , " that all the professions are no good any more , you might just as well be a bricklayer . Doctors , can you imagine , they go to school for twelve years and when they get through they  | ca n't even earn a living . That 's a fact . He started out to study to be a doctor but now he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't earn a living ? " said Anna . " Why not ? " " There are too many , " Mrs. Pincus explained . " There are too many doctors , and too many dentists , and too many everything . That 's the trouble with the world . " THERE was only one other person for Ida Feingold to get into her army , then she would be ready for battle . She was not eager to talk to Mr. Stratford . His wife was all right but with him she had never spoken ten words . Still , he was a man and she needed men in her gang . She had to wait for the janitor to get out of the hall . Suppose some one talked to him and spilled the beans ? He was at Mrs. Smiley 's door . Ida held her tongue in her teeth . If that little stool pigeon ? . No , nothing . He was coming upstairs . He was standing at her own door . The dumb ox , would he never go away ! At last the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked at Stratford 's door . There was a wait long enough for it to seem that no one  | was home . Then the door was opened . " Mr. Stratford , " she said , " I got to talk to you . " He stared at her . Then , with the manner of a distinguished attorney showing a client into his office , he bowed her into the room . She felt that she entered some strange oldfashioned house , not a flat in the same building . The very walls seemed aged , their new stucco hidden under a vast number of photographs of all shapes and sizes that fitted together like pieces of a picture-puzzle , covering the entire surface . In triple-deep black frames the pictures showed longfaced women with high-piled hair , round-eyed men with large mustaches , families grouped on dim back porches . A document sealed with red ribbon , framed in a gilt frame , occupied the center of one wall , while on the wall opposite was tacked an American flag , against which there hung a fancy-handled sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the big war , and the sword , his wife had once explained to Ida Feingold , was his emblem of office in a secret order that was in some way connected with his patriotic service . The furniture in the flat was old style , heavy and big . A wide table surrounded by six solid chairs was in the middle of the room ; there was a  | sideboard almost the size of a grand piano , upon which rested a large cut-glass bowl and pitcher ; there was a desk , crammed with papers , burdened with thick books . Mr. Stratford motioned her to one of the chairs , seated himself stiffly opposite her , and said , " Yes ? " She tried to speak without swearing and with plain words in good English . " They 're going to throw out the Joraceks , " she said . " Ah . An eviction . Most unfortunate , " he repeated , and she thought he was going to write it down with a pencil . " Hell , " she said to herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a certain stiff strength in him , like the unexpected strength of a rusty wire when you try to break it in your hands . Looking him over , he could n't be more than fifty . She stammered through with her story . As Mr. Stratford listened he found it hard to restrain himself from seizing her by the shoulders ; should he tie her to the chair and then telephone the government that he had captured a foreign spy , an agent of revolution ? But no , he would be clever ! He would let her go on , let her divulge her entire scheme , and then , at just the right mo-ment ?  | " All the neighbors got to stick together , " she said . " I might be next , you might be next . We got to strike for our rights . " She thought his eyes would pop out of his head . He gave her a fright , the way he rose up at her . " In other words , " he said , " it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ida , " we just got to help out those dumb Joraceks , that 's all . " " Do you believe in our democracy ? " he said . " Have you no faith in the justice of our govern-ment ? " " Sure . " She tried to quiet him . " That 's okay . I got nothing against the government . Only ? " " Very well . " He pointed the pencil down on the table . He seemed greatly relieved . " Very well . As a loyal citizen who has offered to lay down his life on the altar of liberty , I am happy to hear you say that , Mrs. Feingold . I am happy to have persuaded you ! Then you will not continue with this disgraceful plan . If your claims are just , you will find a just and lawful way to bring them to the attention of the proper authorities , and I am sure  - -  She was in a lunatic asylum ! " Take it easy , " she said to herself . " Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Feingold , "  | he said , " I have an idea ! I have conceived a plan ! Believe me , I am in sympathy with your cause . My heart is always touched by honest poverty . I too , as you may know , have suffered unemployment . But we must bear with the times . We must not allow our personal difficulties to embitter our attitudes and endanger the very structure of our government , the very principles of law and order . My plan is this . We will write a letter to the proper authorities . We will write an open letter to the mayor of the city calling his attention to the need of this family . I myself will write the letter . I shall send a copy to be published in the newspapers . I am certain that aid will be forthcoming . Mrs. Feingold , I 'll write the letter at once ! But you must promise , " and now his voice was softly chiding , " not to go any further with those uh  --  impulsive plans ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had , in some way , prevailed . He had always known that when a great crisis arose at which he might be of service to his country he would be found adequate , and ready . " I 'll sit down at once to write the letter . " " Yah , " said Ida . Maybe he was n't crazy . Maybe he was trying to kid her . And at the same moment she felt a pain right inside her for poor Mrs. Stratford . " Yah , it 's a good idea . A letter . You  | write it and I 'll sign it . " She began to back to the door . But she could n't get out so easy . He was standing over her with that strange insistent smile on his face . My God , he wanted her to stay there . " I 'll sit down at once to write the letter . " She 'd slam him one and beat it . But just then , bursting into Stratford 's sickly smile like a tempest into a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're coming ! " His fierce whisper was almost a yell . Ida whirled , dashed out . They left Mr. Stratford standing there , his mouth open , his pencil poised . Ida ran after Red . " Are you sure ? How dya know it was them ? " " Ca n't I tell a flat-foot when I see one ? " said Red . " There 's a cop and two guys . A little guy and a bigger guy . " " A cop ? " said Ida . She had not figured on a cop . Who ever heard of sending policemen to carry out furniture ? " That 's all right , " Red said . " We can take care of him , too . " And he spat on his hands and gripped the bat . They had got into their flat . Mrs. Feingold stuck her head out the window and saw the three  | men coming up Spring street . They were looking at the numbers on the houses . She must bang the signal on the radiator . With what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near her hand  --  a table-spoon , and struck it against the metal . It made a feeble sound . " Here ! " cried Red , and banged the bat on the radiator . " Say , you 'll have the fire department out ! " Ida snatched hold of the bat . Then she went into the corridor , to station her army .  | IT 'S a ten to one shot that horse was poisoned , " said Jerry Geiger , coming up Spring Street with the man named Young Harris and the cop Mullins , and talking of the race horse that had died last night of the colic . " Jeez , that always makes me mad , " he said . " Take a poor defenseless animal like that . Somebody comes sneaking along and puts poison in the feed . A man has a chance . A man can fight back . But only a bastard would poison a poor defenseless horse . " " Yup , " said Harris . He never said much more than that . He said " Yup " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he said " Yup " when he got a dime handout . He would say " Yup " if some one took the dime away from him , and if he got into court and the judge said " Twenty days " or " Twenty years , " it would make no difference , all he would say would be " Yup . " You could n't call Harris dumb . Plenty of the boys on the road could tell you of the nifty wriggles he invented when some one had to squirm  | out of a hole . But things had never come much his way and he had n't bothered to go out of his way to collect them ; he did n't believe in trusting anything , luck or men ; take what comes was what he did , take what comes with a " Yup . " Luck was like a train you see sometimes on a movie screen , it seems to be coming head-on toward you but just before it 's on top of you it swerves to a side and misses you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the name Young Harris that a silly mother had given him , " Be always young , " she had said ; and he had turned old at twelve . That was when she skipped the coop with some traveling bird , leaving her son with that fancy label , blessing him with eternal youth , bless her in hell ; at the age of thirty Harris was a bum with a limitless stretch of the road behind him , and even then his face was like it was now : a dry whitish skin with hollows deep as screw-holes pinched under the cheeks , a shrunken jaw suggesting toothlessness : it was the face of a quite old man , a man that might be sixty-five . Not that he was glad or sad of his life . Things could have been different , he knew . Shape it another way and it would be different . But a lot would have to be changed in this world before  | bums like him could fall into a softer mold , a hell of a lot . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do what you could , whenever the throttle came into your hand , but keep your mouth shut . The way he happened to be here to-day was funny , if that kind of thing tickled you . The other night he had been hanging around Columbus Circle at the edge of the park . There being a couple of swell hotels there , people buzzed around , lots of fat gents came out with their cigars for a stroll in the park , making it a good spot for a hungry man to haunt . Especially a handler like Young Harris ; he was always good in fat spots , and extra good with men . He hit them where they were soft . After one look at him they were struck with the thought , there , but for the grace of God , goes yours truly . Maybe he knew he made that come into their minds . There was a kind of a personal squint in his eye when he stuck out his hand to a man . It got results . That night along came two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked like a college athlete and his proud father , the older one being built like the prize bull that still can lift the  | offspring on his horns and toss him for a goal any fine morning . Young Harris drifted by them , making a little mumble as he passed , barely lifting his palm . That was his way . Never fully honor them with the begging hand . The two men halted , and halted him . The junior of them looked him over up and down . " Well , you 're getting pretty much on in years for this sort of thing , " the junior said cheerfully . " Yup , " said Young Harris , letting the men feel their own youth more strongly , though the junior of them was no kid himself , but up to forty at least . Then the older man looked at him cheerfully and said , " At that , I bet you are n't as old as I am ! " With a grand swing of his arm he lifted away his hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How old do you think I am ? " he said , standing stiff as a recruit , smirking eager as a kid who announces he 's eight going on nine . Young Harris let his rheumy eyes wander up and down the chesty gymnasium-stuffed figure of the old man . But he did n't offer any guess . " Sixty-nine ! " announced the hale and hearty white-haired gent . And then , still looking at  | Harris , he said , " Yes , I 'm pretty well preserved for my age . The junior handed Harris a quarter . But the senior , with brisk friendliness , said , " Say , you ought n't to be going around like this ! " With keen lively eyes he saw under the decaying crust of Harris 's flesh , saw that the beggar might be no older than his son ! " I think I could get some work for you . Want to work ? " " Yup , " said Harris . You could duck a job any time . The senior took out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harris saw the words : " Friend of mine . Fix him up . " " Must be a judge , " Harris figured . " You take that around to the marshal 's office in the morning , " said the judge . " That 's his name on there . They probably need a little more help these days . " With a final great smile he handed Harris a half dollar , then marched springily on his way . As the two men went , Young Harris heard the senior telling the junior , " It 's all in the way you take care of yourself . " A COUPLE of days went by before Harris bothered to scratch that card out of his pocket and  | drift over to the marshal 's office . With all the evictions going on , the marshal needed an extra hand occasionally , so Young Harris was sent with Jerry Geiger to perform a day 's work . " He would have broken all the records ! " Jerry Geiger swore about that poisoned horse . " He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a candle . Jeez , a thing like that gets you . " And glancing up at the number on the building , " This is the joint , I guess . " WITHIN the house , things were quickly ready for them . Ida Feingold burst into the Joracek flat . " They 're coming ! " she cried . Anna Joracek went at once to the window , and looked out . Two men , she saw , and a policeman . " Is that them ? " she said . " Who dya think they are ? Get a move on ! " Anna kept looking at them . Maybe she had been waiting for an army of soldiers carrying bayonets ; Polish soldiers . Strange she should feel now as if she was back home . Marie was leaning far out of the other window . " You come away from there ! " Anna ordered .  | Silently Marie withdrew her head . She slipped into the hallway . Joracek stood by the table . Absently , as one might hold a pipe , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Ida Feingold was running here and there , bursting through doors , talking to people , something muddled inside him had been growing clear . This whole business that had at first seemed the excited play of women had been coming home in him until now he felt it right , he would answer with this deed as he would answer with his name . What else should he do ? If people came and tried to drive you out of your house , you with your wife and your children , out of your own hut that you had built , you fought them . No matter who they were or how many , you fought them . All those others , the excited Jewish woman , and the woman with the pancakes , and all the women that were rushing into the hallway as if there was a fire in the house , all those others were attending to something else . He was tending to his own , house , to Anna and to Marie . He would stand in the doorway and would not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing there . For the first time he saw that he held the stick . He hefted it and felt that it was a good weapon , a cudgel.  | Thus he stood . He was not a tall man , but he was broadly made , and he looked solid and obstinate as a tree-trunk that would not come out of the ground until it was blasted . He saw Anna and Marie in the hallway . This did not seem right to him . His women should be inside his house . " Get inside , " he said . Red Feingold stood there swinging his bat back and forth like a home run hitter getting ready to step to the plate . Marie ran up to him . " Whatcha gon na do , Red ? " " Baby , I 'm gon na knock ' em for a goal . ' " Get inside ! " Joracek commanded the girl . Anna took hold of the girl and pulled her toward the door . " That 's right , kid , you better get inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father , poking her head between his arm and the door frame to see what happened in the hall . Anna Joracek stood partly in the doorway , beside her husband . She had nothing in her hands . Ida saw this and yelled , " Here , you take this ! " pressing her own weapon , a piece of iron curtain pole , into Anna 's hands , and rushing into her flat to find other arms . She looked wildly around , saw  | nothing dangerous , only a big pitcher , no , find something better , she pulled open the closet door , all the time her ears were listening for steps on the stairs , her hair clung damp to forehead sweat , she yanked an umbrella out of the closet darkness , you could poke their eyes out with that , no , then she stumbled on some tools she had never thrown out after her husband had left , there was a big hand-saw , she grabbed that , " Oh boy ! " she said aloud , " that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw . Mrs. Pincus was already at her post at the top of the stairs , holding her broom horizontal to bar the passageway . Stanced stoutly on her spread feet , she looked , from below , like a colossal stone monument , immovable , stuck across the passage filling it from wall to wall . From her door below her sister called up to her , " All right , stay there ! If you want to do it , stay there . But do n't say I sent you . " " Aw , come on , come up here , " said Mrs. Pincus . " I ? ' What are you talking about ? " " Come up with the neighbors ! " said Mrs. Pincus . " Sure , Mrs. Feldscher , do n't you live in the house ! " yelled Ida .  | " Me ? I am a visitor , only a visitor , " declared Mrs. Feldscher . " She wo n't come , " said Bertha Pincus . She wondered should she go back into the flat ? But Celia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only her way , standing on the side-lines and watching life . Times like this , or when she stood with the other wives of cap-makers on strike in front of the shop where her husband worked , Bertha felt in herself a wakening pleasure ; she liked to be sociable , to be in the swim of life . Her sister , she suddenly saw , was like some one who takes a child to the beach , remaining on the sand watching the child splashing among the waves . " Come on in ! The water 's fine ! " the child cries , but the watcher , though an expert swimmer , stays on the sand , ready to rush in and rescue the child if the waves become treacherous . Just then Bertha felt Ida 's hands on her shoulders . Ida 's hands were almost like her sister 's hands , strongly pulling her together . " You stand a little lower . Here . Fine ! " Ida said , marching her down to the turning of the stairs , a more sudden and strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . " Mrs. Feingold ! " she hissed , waving her little hammer .  | " Shhh ! " said Ida , whirling on her . " Oh ! " Mrs. Novak put her hand to her mouth . Holding up the hammer , she whispered , " I only wanted to ask you , is this all right ? " Ida burst into laughter . " Say , you look like the Statue of Liberty ! You could n't scare a mouse with that thing ! " " Say , " Tillie pleaded , " do you think a mop would be all right , a wet mop ? " " Now you 're talking , " said Ida . Mrs. Novak rushed off . Then stopped . " Have I got time ? " she said . " Hurry up ! " hissed Ida . " And come and stand right here , behind me . See ! " Mrs. Novak ran upstairs for the mop she had all ready , soaking in a bucket . The baby was asleep , she saw , as she flew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy Bertha Pincus as advance guard on the middle stair landing . Then came Ida Feingold flush on the top stair , her murderous saw held aloft ; a streak of light shone down its teeth , making it look much bigger than it was , making it terrible and huge as the jaws of some prehistoric animal . Behind Ida was her son , Red . He could n't stay on one spot , but jerked continuously in a circle , still trying that bat , like the  | swat king who hovers around the plate till the ball is pitched , then suddenly steps in and wow ! Every second Red looked back to Marie , giving her nods and motions of assurance . Sturdy little Mrs. Novak , with her dripping mop uplifted , stood between Ida and Red Feingold ; and just back of the three of them , at their door , stood Joracek with his wife . Through that hushed moment , before the men came up the stairs , the whole thing felt like a surprise party joke , so funny , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of them to stop a runaway horse ! One quiet waiting minute they all listened . The bell rang . Though they were all waiting for it , the sound felt sudden like a jab in the back . All turned their heads to hear the bell ringing in the Joracek flat . " Do n't answer ! " Ida whispered hoarsely . At that instant Mrs. Smiley opened her door . She was dressed in her fur-collar coat and her little black hat , with her neat black gloves on her hands . She was locking her door when Ida hissed at her , " Where do yu think you 're going ? " " None of your business , " said Mrs. Smiley . " Oh , no you do n't . Not now . Get in there . " Ida advanced on her .  | " I 've got a right to go out whenever I please . Say , who do you think you are anyway ? " " Get in there , you little stool pigeon ! Get in there or I 'll ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Red came behind Ida . " Get in there before I sock yu down , " he said . Mrs. Smiley felt a horrible fear that nearly turned her stomach . She was afraid to scream . " Bunch of murderers ! " she sobbed hysterically , her little fists clawing the air . " Bunch of murderers ! " She tore at the key , unlocked her door , ran inside feeling Red 's broken-toothed laughter like bayonet-stabs in her back . She flung herself on the couch . Through her fierce , fierce anger she unwillingly kept seeing the Joraceks sitting on their cheap furniture at night on the street . " What are they to me ! What are they to me ! " she muttered , pounding the couch . Red Feingold saw where Mrs. Smiley had left the key in the lock . He turned it shut . " For cry sake , Red , she 'll call the police or something ! " said Ida . " She ai n't got no telephone . " " She 'll scream out the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off her , " he said . The Joracek bell rang a second time , long and hard .  | A man 's voice downstairs said , " Maybe they ai n't home . " Another said , " Aw , they 're home all right . " " It 's the third floor , ai n't it ? " The other voice , harder , more authoritative , said , " Second . That 's the bell all right . " The smaller voice spelled out the name . " J-O-R-A-C-E-K . " It spoke somewhat huskily as through a fur-lined throat . " Maybe we ought to get the janitor . " " Hell , never find them around these dumps . They got one janitor for the whole block . Come on up . " Yeah , the door 's open . " The steps of the men were heard now , advancing on the stairs . " Three of them , " Ida muttered . And behind her the words echoed , from one mouth to another , " Three of them . " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she suddenly said , turning to her son . " Oke , " he said . And spat on his hands , gripped his bat . " Gim me the cop . " With each upward step of the men , the excitement in the waiting ones was screwed tighter , as if the legs of the men were treading on cogs of a spring within them that tightened , tightened .  | Now the thing seemed no longer funny at all . Tillie Novak saw the staff of her mop trembling . She did n't dare go away . Some of the water dripped into her shoes . Maybe she was doing something wrong . Mrs. Dobrowsky was not there . It was like coming to a party only to find the friend you wanted to see was n't there , instead all were strangers , and it was n't even a party , but a serious meeting . Maybe she was doing something wrong . Maybe Charlie would lose his job on account of her . In a panic , she looked behind her . If only her baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected what the next turn in the stairs would disclose , and they made their way casually upward , with the deliberate casualness of men bent upon some known cruelty . Young Harris was n't bothered if he had to chuck some wops onto the sidewalk . His inside feelings , kept away from the feelings that had to do with the motions he made in the world , might be something else . Only a few times in his life had those inside feelings come up into action . He had long ago reached a way of life where no suffering  | either in himself or in others could make him bat an eyelash . He had been in a war , once . Jerry Geiger knew what he was come here to do , all right , but he had done it plenty of times before , hell , somebody had to do the dirty work in this world , it was like being an undertaker , you could n't help it if people died and it was your job to bury them , and the best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your job no matter what it was . He had a couple of cigars in his vest pocket right now ; after he was through he would smoke a cigar and give a cigar apiece to the boys . Sort of took the taste out of your mouth . That would be an extra cigar for the cop . Never sent cops along before ; did n't need them in this district anyway ; hell , he could handle anything himself . They were getting so scared up in the office , the next thing you know , they 'd be calling out the militia every time they had to pinch a guy for parking . Al Mullins was just a policeman . That was the way he thought of himself all the time . " I 'm just a cop . " He used to say that to his wife , pulling his good-natured grin , every time she bothered him for something she could n't get . " I 'm just a cop . Cop 's kids do n't go to college . "  | BUT as the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Pincus spread across the stairs , her broomstick barring the passage ; there she stood with her face all pulled into a knot , like some crazy woman in a Russian revolution movie . " What the hell , " said Jerry Geiger . The cop just stood there with his arms loose at his sides , looking up at the bulk of that woman . Her legs above him were as fat as tree trunks . She could have been in a circus . Mullins did n't reach for his stick . He had come along on this job like for a couple of hours off . Nobody would expect to have to raise a stick in a place like this . Finding the woman there was like walking into a hold-up when you were off-duty and out of uniform ; that had never happened to him , but he had never felt he 'd be the one to pitch in and arrest the guys like some of the heroes on the force were always doing . When Young Harris saw the woman on guard , and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the landing behind her , he just leaned himself against the bannister and got ready to be an observer . He was like a taxi driver who does n't mind waiting while the meter ticks . In a minute he would sit down on the stairs and  | fish for a cigarette-butt he had stowed away under his shirt . Let the rest of the apes palaver . Jerry Geiger , coming up on the inside , could n't see the rest of the tenants above the bend of the stairway . But the minute he saw Mrs. Pincus , knowing that something was up , he decided to take it easy and pretend maybe she was just sweeping the stairs and did n't want to let strangers into the building . He said in a friendly way , " Does a Joracek live up here ? " There was no answer . The fat woman simply stood there staring at them , her broom held firmly in front of her . He spelled out the name . Suddenly , from above , there came Ida Feingold 's raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . And descending a few steps , so that her angry red face appeared just above Mrs. Pincus , she flung at them , " What of it ? " " Nothing much , " said Jerry Geiger . " I got a dispossess for this Joracek family . Is that you ? " " None of your business , " said Ida . " You ai n't gon na dispossess nobody . They live here and they 're gon na keep right on living here . " With that she swung her saw up above her head . " Now beat it ! " she commanded .  | Al Mullins shrunk a step downward , his hand in front of his face . " Say ! " Geiger crowded close to the policeman . That red-faced woman made his spine crawl . " Who the hell are you ? " he roared . " Are you Mrs. Joracek ? " At that moment Red came behind his mother . Standing on the stair above her , his head over hers , he looked a lot bigger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Gwan chase yourself . " Jerry Geiger elbowed the policeman . " Come on , " he said . " We better get to work . " Mullins slowly unlimbered his club . " One side ! " commanded Jerry Geiger , making as if to advance , but at the same time placing himself so that Mullins had to go in front of him . Mrs. Pincus did not budge . Her face remained unchanged . She might have been made of stone . " One side , d' ya hear me , or the whole bunch of you gets pinched . " A sort of titter moved through the hall . Geiger 's head jerked . The laughing sound strangely seemed to start from below him where Young Harris stood , and to go up through Mrs. Pincus and Ida Feingold to the others back there . He whirled on Young Harris , but saw him only  | leaning in a dead uninterested way against the wall . " Come on , you , " Geiger said , and Harris straightened apathetically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , and a woman in the doorway watching him . Seeing the woman in the doorway make a sign to the fat woman on the stairs , he whirled back again toward Mrs. Pincus . Geiger had a rotten feeling now that the whole place was filled with crazy women all armed with bottles , brooms , mops , hammers , rolling-pins , all of them peering from behind doors and corners of the hallway , all tittering at him standing there helpless before the fat housewife . " Arrest that woman ! " he ordered Mullins , indicating Mrs. Pincus . The policeman hesitantly went up one step . Then Mrs. Feldscher , standing in the doorway below , opened her mouth to make a speech . " You go back to your bosses , " she said , " and tell those dirty slave drivers that you ca n't get into the house , tell them they ai n't going to put anybody out of here unless they put everybody out , and the only way they can do that is to carry out our dead bodies ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What the hell ! " cried Jerry Geiger , as if a  | brilliant light had suddenly been switched on , letting him recognize everybody in that murky hallway . " It 's a bunch of bolsheviks ! " He prodded Mullins . " Come on ! " Mullins went up one more step . Now , if he reached out his arm , he could seize the broom . He raised his club . " Let her alone ! " cried Joracek , rushing forward . " She ai n't Joracek . I 'm Joracek . What you want ? You ca n't come in here ! " He stood , his bat raised , gaping at the marshal , himself startled that he had rushed forward , that he had spoken . Geiger looked him up and down . " Hiding behind a bunch of skirts , uh ? " He turned his lapel , showing his deputy marshal 's star . " In the name of the law , " he announced , " get out of the way . We got to carry out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't carry out anything to-day . " Geiger could feel her hot breath in his face . " You ca n't scare us with your little tin star . " " That 's enough ! " yelled the marshal . " You 're the trouble-maker here , I guess . " He seized her arm . With one pull she freed herself and swung the saw over him . He leaped back , nearly tripping , catching at the bannister to keep from falling  | down the stairs . There was an instantaneous laugh . Mullins lifted his club to strike the woman with the saw . Like a shot , Red came from behind Mrs. Pincus , grabbed the club out of Mullins ' hand . The movement was so sudden that the policeman had n't even gripped the club . Now the laugh was sharp from Red and Ida . It was echoed behind them , hesitantly , by little Mrs. Novak . She even waved her wet mop , pushing it slightly forward , to show she was ready to stick it in their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mullins , curtly , under his breath . " What the hell you standing there for ? " Mullins , dazed , reached into his holster . He drew the pistol and held it firmly in front of him . A lulled hush fell over all the people . " Come on , " said Geiger again . He and Mullins went up one step . They stood now where they had stood before . " Come on , " and they moved again . First , only Mrs. Pincus 's eyes changed from immobility . They turned slowly downwards , fastening on the small black mouth of the pistol . Then her body mounted backwards , one step . Geiger let out a little laugh . " Bunch of crazy women , " he muttered . But  | they heard him . He felt his words thrown back at him from every corner of the house . " Yeah ! " Ida yelled . " Well you just come one step nearer , I dare you ! " She waved with her arms , and the people closed behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocking the landing . They stood there , staring at the pointed gun in the hands of the policeman . Geiger swallowed . " Now listen , " he said , assuming an equable tone , " listen to me , you dames . We 're just here in the line of duty and we got to dispossess the Joracek family . They ai n't paid their rent for three months . Now get back the bunch of you and leave us do our work , and any complaints you got to make go over to the department with them . We do n't want to hurt anybody but if any one starts trouble , we 'll go the limit . " Even as he spoke he told himself that was the way to handle this kind of a situation , he could hear himself telling the boys in the office how he had handled it . Ca n't ride over Geiger . All the time , Mrs. Pincus kept staring at the small round mouth of the gun . Somehow the sight of the gun sickened her flesh . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . She wanted to stand firm , but the gun moved so  | slowly toward her , and her body backed upward , backed one step , another step , until she stood on the top landing and saw that the others had closed in front of her : Ida Feingold , her son Red , and Joe Joracek were standing one step below the landing , between her and that murderous small mouth . Red swung his bat in one hand and the policeman 's club in the other ; his lips were clamped into a narrow red line , and his eyes gleamed with insane pleasure . As he talked , Geiger figured out what to do next . Now he felt sure which door opened into the Joracek flat . The woman with the curtain pole stood in the doorway , a little girl was inside . " All right now everybody get away from there , " he said , and pressed the policeman forward toward that door . " The hell we will ! " It was the crazy red-faced woman with the saw again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geiger reached out his arm and gave Ida a sudden push that sent her stumbling backwards . No one knew exactly what happened in the next instant . It was one of those strange moments when a single movement releases a whole series of wild unrelated movements . Red started forward in a lunge at the cop .  | At the same instant , Anna Joracek let out a low growling kind of scream , and the scream set off that whole mob of women , they seemed all to come in one surge toward the policeman and the marshal . But what made Mullins completely lose control of himself was the flash of the sword from behind them . The sense of the boy lunging at him , and the nerve-racking low animal scream of the woman that accompanied the lunge , were suddenly convulsed into a terrifying movement , a waving sword charging at him , coming faster than the lunging boy 's body . That sword was in the hands of Herbert Stratford . Mr. Stratford had been sitting right behind his door , listening , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policeman arrive . He had heard the clamor in the hallway , heard what seemed to him the desperate fighting of one officer against a horde of women . And when Geiger 's voice cried " Bolsheviks ! " Herbert Stratford arose , went to the wall , and took down his huge dull sword . Now he emerged , waving the sword above his head , charging upon the crowd , and yelling some  | mad , undistinguishable fragment of battle-cry that sounded like " Down with the revolution ! " It was that sword , seeming to come directly at his eyes , that gave Mullins the sense of having already been blinded , of being hacked to pieces by this infuriated mob . Al Mullins had never been meant to be a policeman . He was all right for standing on a corner and telling an old lady how to get to Mulberry street , but no good for anything else . All his twelve years on the force he had lived in a constant dread of the moment that would show him up , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting in some alley and have to act quick , of the moment when he might have to stand in a riot line with a picked squad and hold back a fighting mob . Now here the moment had come , and he was alone , facing a crowd of crazy women ; from the time he had reluctantly taken out his gun his head had been swaying in a blurred and drunken daze , and he had no idea where he stood or what he was doing . And just as the kid Red and the sword lunged toward him on that low animal scream , for some impossible reason , surely not because his finger had wilfully pressed the trigger , the gun went off . The kid fell on his face right there in the hallway .  | No one believed it . They all heard the shot , an instant later saw the policeman holding the gun that looked so exactly the same , as if nothing had come out of it ; they saw Red bleeding on the iron stairtop , and no one believed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those unmade sounds that are nevertheless audible , went like a spine shiver all up and down the hall . The people were silent as a group of children whose innocent game has suddenly resulted in disaster . Then , before a word had been spoken , Anna Joracek walked forward and took the gun from the policeman 's hand . He gave it to her , just as a caught murderer , surrounded and covered , gives up his weapon to the law . Ida Feingold fell to her knees beside her son , turned over his body , and began frantically to tear pieces off her clothes pressing the cloth against the blood flowing from the boy 's breast . Out of her there came spiked sobbing , jagged sounds that seemed to have torn their way through crags . Her whole body jerked tight with each sob , and she had to wait for her trembling hand to steady before she could touch his open flesh . Afterwards  | she began a moaning murmur over him , calling to him in Yiddish , " Zuhnaleh , Zuhnaleh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of older people ; she sat on the floor now holding Red 's head in her lap . Within her heart , she felt the strangest way . She had never known she could feel like this . It was as though she were all the time knowing how she wanted to feel and still feeling different . She wanted to feel for him like for a dead loved hero . Instead she kept feeling different . She kept feeling as if there was a black empty hole inside her , and two converging sharp pains , like needles burned red hot , were going through the points of her breasts into that black hole . No one had noticed Young Harris before . He had been standing down there somewhere on the stairs . But now he was standing over the body . " Call a doctor , " Jerry Geiger was chattering . " No use , " said Young Harris . " He 's dead . " He stooped , peering into the hard eyes . " Yup . " Marie looked up to him . Always afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not Red 's face . Times , at night , she would brush her nervous hands against her forehead , whispering " Go away , go away " to drive off that  | solemn face so she could see Red Feingold , so she could call him to her , Red , the man who gave his life for her ! Now she looked at Red , close , close , trying with all that was in her to gather the sight of him into herself in that one moment , so he would be with her always . His mouth drew her terribly strong , she could see nothing else but his mouth fallen just a small crack open , as if a funny tough word had dropped from it ; something wise and warm and brute ugly was about the mouth , something she had been afraid of but liked this morning when he had come and stood by her and pressed his naked skin against her side . Marie was all mixed now , between what she was doing because she must , and what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself at this moment doing a certain thing . She bent her face over his mouth . Instead of the way she thought she was going to kiss him , small and short and gentle , she found her mouth holding tight to his , sucking all the dying warmth out of his mouth ; she was feeling a terrible hunger for the life of him all down inside herself , feeling his dead kiss all the way below her heart , in her very insides ; she was trying to pull life upward in him , upward to the kiss of his mouth ; almost , almost she drew life into his mouth , but it was n't there .  | And somebody 's strong hands lifted her and stood her on her feet . That was her father , Joe Joracek , he had lifted her up . Then Joe knelt to pick up the body of the boy . But the moment he felt the weight of the warm flesh on his arms , he felt his heart raw , as if that weight had somehow ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this day . He arose with the body in his arms . Only one other time in his life had he felt his heart so naked within himself . The time Anna had given birth , and the midwife had placed the very small live body of Marie on his open hands . So , within him at this moment , the grief was as for the death of his one child . Red 's right arm hung down . The policeman 's club , dragged loose from his hand , fell and rolled down the iron stairs with slow staggering bumps until it reached the landing , where it lay cornered . Ida his mother caught Red 's hand and held it in her two hands , pressing close until the points of the iron ring on his finger dug far into the flesh of her palm . Joracek carried the boy into the Feingold flat , and placed him on the bed still rumpled from his mother 's sleep . Ida Feingold clung after  | Joracek as though she were part of the body he carried . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly much smaller , suddenly much more the body of an ungrown kid , than it had seemed alive a moment ago ; then it had seemed almost a large angry man , in its furious tight-knuckled lunge . IN the hallway , Mrs. Novak had moved close to Mrs. Pincus . Tillie Novak kept whispering , " He killed him ! No ! Is he dead ! He did n't kill him ! He 's dead ! " Her mop , still dripping wet , lay on the hall floor near the splotch of dark blood . Mrs. Pincus did not answer Mrs. Novak . Her flat watery eyes were fixed on the gun in the hands of Anna Joracek . When the shot had sounded , Mrs. Pincus had felt a stabbing shock through the middle of her body , as if the bullet had entered there . Slowly she realized it was another who had been killed , not herself . But still she saw the black round mouth of the pistol prowling in the hallway . It had already killed , and it was free ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the policeman , who stood there frozen still , his eyes glassy almost as those of the dead boy . " You killed him , " Anna said in a strange  | heavy voice that hit Al Mullins like a sledgehammer . " Put it away ! Throw it away ! " Mrs. Pincus cried to Anna . " It 'll kill somebody ! " Just then she felt the grip of her sister 's hand on her arm . " Shut up ! " said Mrs. Feldscher . " Let her do what she wants . " Now Bertha Pincus could take her eyes from that small round mouth of iron . She saw the policeman . He was familiar to her eyes . His was the same face that had been coming up the stairs at her . But without the gun in his hands he did not seem a killer . It was not he that had killed . " She 'll shoot him ! " Bertha Pincus gasped to her sister . " She 'll shoot him for revenge ! " " Let them do whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is none of your business . Go in your house . " " What ? " said Bertha Pincus . For the first time she heard the words of her sister as coming from outside of herself . She turned , startled , as if seeing a stranger there . A small dark woman , she saw , some one separated from herself . " Let them kill each other , what do you care ! " snapped Mrs. Feldscher . Her cold angry eyes whipped over all those people in the hallway as over so many fish in a basket .  | " No ! No ! " cried Mrs. Pincus . " Why should any one be killed ! There should n't be any guns ! No one should be killed ! " Anna Joracek stood in front of the three men , holding the revolver . Mrs. Pincus stuck out her hand , putting the fleshy palm against the mouth of the gun . " No one should be killed ! You hear , Anna ! No one should be hurt ! " Until then Anna did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known she must hold the pistol . She would not have felt it strange if the pistol in her own hands had shot out a bullet , if she had seen one of the three men drop dead . She felt rising , rising within herself a great mountain of grief , she felt that somehow , somewhere about her there was a way through which the grief and the swelling hatred within her would be released , eased . A bullet , spewed from the gun , would leave an opening out of which the black poison that now mounted in her breast would flow , leaving her eased . But yet her ache of pity seemed not for the dead boy , and her pain of hatred seemed not for the guilty man . Heavily , heavily she felt the ache of pity for her husband , Joe Joracek , who stood by the bed of the boy . " No one should be killed ! No one should be hurt ! " she heard Mrs. Pincus crying . Then Anna  | motioned with the revolver at the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door of her own flat . " Go there , " she said . The policeman and the marshal shuffled obediently toward the door . " You too , " Anna said to Young Harris , and he shrugged slightly and followed the other men into the room . TILLIE NOVAK in horror watched Anna Joracek hold the gun against the three men . " What is she doing ! What is she going to do ! " Any second the gun would go off , the men would fall dead ! Oh ! She had fallen into another world , a world of slaughter where animals that seemed like human beings slaughtered each other and wallowed in blood . Oh , if she could run , run away ! Yet drawn by her horror she followed Anna to the door of that room . Anna jerked her head toward the pantry . The three men pressed themselves into the small space . The minute they were inside she closed and locked the door on them . The turning of the key was as a release to Tillie Novak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run to Mrs. Dobrowsky . She would bury her face in Mrs. Dobrowsky 's lap . The woman would  | stroke her hair while she sobbed , " They killed the boy ! I saw it with my own eyes ! And now she is going to kill the men , three men ! Oh , stop her ! " She ran to the stairs . Anna Joracek saw little Mrs. Novak scurrying away . " Where you going , you ! " she called , halting her . " I ? I ? " Tillie Novak could not say she was going to Mrs. Dobrowsky . " Outside . I 'll call the police . " " Police ! " Anna felt it in herself to laugh . " Yah , then they shoot all of us . " The big frightened eyes of the woman were like Marie 's eyes . " You come back here , " Anna said , without realizing that with all her commands now she waved her gun at people . " Everybody stays here , " she said . " Everybody keep still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her heart pounded . Now she wanted Charlie . If she could only get to him , get on his car . " Charlie , they killed some one in the house ! Charlie  --  ! " And then it seemed to her that Charlie was in the house , Charlie was locked in that room ! No , it was the policeman . The policeman , not her Charlie .  | She caught at Mrs. Feldscher 's dress . " What will they do to him ? " " Who ? " " Him . The policeman . " " Him ? " Mrs. Feldscher shrugged . " He 's a cop , ai n't he ? He got a right to kill anybody . " THROUGH her darkness , as she huddled by the bed , those last words came to Ida Feingold . Over and over she heard them . She jumped up , went into the hall . " Well ? " Anna Joracek said to her . " Where are they ? " Ida demanded . " In there . I got them locked . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . She felt she could see through the door , inside , see the three yellow bastards . Her lower lip sucked under her bared upper teeth . " Gim me that gun ! " she said . Anna drew back . Mrs. Pincus cried , " Ida ! Ida ! what good will it do you to kill people ! The boy is dead . Alive it will not make him ! " Mrs. Feldscher said , " Let her alone . She got a right . " " Do n't give it to her ! She 'll kill him ! " Mrs.  | Novak put the back of her hand over her mouth . Ida stood in front of Anna . " Well ? " Her fists were clenched . She would seize the gun and kill . " I 'll kill the whole damn bunch of them ! " But as Ida , blazing with hatred , came toward her , Anna held the gun more tightly . " Not this , not this , " she felt . The right was Ida 's , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were three men , and the boy was one ? She stood immovable , looking into Ida 's face . Would such slaughter bring her peace ? In that moment Anna saw as if somewhere a guilty one stood against a wall . A man held a gun , and fired . The figure crumpled to the ground . And with the shot , out of herself and out of Ida Feingold there eased a pent-up blackness of grief . Joe , too , was given that ease , and somehow Marie : all their feelings were now joined together as the feelings of one person . " Gim me that gun ! " Ida screamed to her , and Ida 's rage was as a hurricane beating against the stone mountain of sorrow that Anna felt within herself . Steadily , endlessly in that moment she looked into the eyes of the maddened woman , drawing Ida 's pain into herself . And under those quiet eyes , Ida 's strength suddenly broke , her  | muscles went soft , and she sank as if she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upheld her , leading her into her house to a chair . Ida touched Anna 's hand . Ida was all weak now , all woman . She was a sister , Anna felt then , a sister in blood . Joracek stood there on the other side of the bed . Anna looked to him , and both of them looked down to Ida . Joracek slowly nodded . He understood . Anna pressed Ida 's hand . " Joe is here , " she said . Ida was quiet . After a while she asked , " Where 's Oscar ? " " He 's all right . He 's in school . " " Do n't tell him , " Ida said . Mrs. Pincus stood near . " I 'll take him into my house when he comes home , " she said . JOE was standing by the bed with Marie . Marie could not take her eyes off the face of the dead boy . She leaned against her father , who had his arm around her waist , and who held her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead boy . " Joe , " Anna said .  | In him , this was happening : He was the only man . They were in a hut back home , back in a wide farming land , where the few houses of the village were set against dark miles of trees , under hills that hid the lights of other far villages . And from the woods some one had come and broken into the hut and killed a child of the family . All were women , there , and growing children . He was the only man . He went over to his wife : " I locked them inside , " she said . He nodded . She had done right . Anna did what was right . Now did she want him to take the gun from her hands and go in there ? That he would have to do . He would have to lead out the policeman . Dimly he saw himself leading the man to a place against the wall . His arm , his hand felt numb against what he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She herself went into the flat . MRS . NOVAK caught at her as she crossed the hall . " You ca n't do it ! Do n't do it ! " she begged . It was her husband , in that closet . A boy in a jersey had run across the car tracks , before Charlie could stop the car the boy lay under the wheels . What if she had asked a policeman instead of a  | street car conductor the way downtown that day ! Anna had shaken her off , gone into the flat . Still Mrs. Novak begged her , " You ca n't kill any one that way ! It 's murder ! Without a trial or anything . " Mrs. Feldscher said coldly , " A lot of trial they gave that boy . " " She 'll shoot them ! " " Why not ! " Then Bertha Pincus knew she hated her sister . All her fat flesh felt a twisted anguish , as if part of her flesh was throwing off another part of herself , throwing off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been within her , and now only she knew that her oppression , her getting no joy out of life came from the feeling of that small dark woman fastened like a crab on her flesh . " You ! " she cried at Celia . " You come here and tell them to murder people ! You hide yourself if you have to fight but if it comes to tell some one else what to do you are here . Do n't listen to her ! " she cried out . " Who will suffer ? Mrs. Joracek ! If you kill him he will suffer , and you will suffer , but she will only watch you and laugh ! Mrs. Joracek ! You will be a murderer ! "  | ALTHOUGH many bright advertisements spoke of the real life-size pantries that were a feature of the model tenement apartments in Marks Gardens , the closet into which the three men had been locked was scarcely large enough to allow of their turning around . Young Harris sat down on the floor , then finding that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squatted there , like an article folded into a box . Jerry Geiger set h , is weight against the door , trying the strength of the lock . If he had room to swing his body , he felt , he could crash the door open . " Come on , push ! " he muttered to the policeman . But Mullins did n't help him . Huddled together in that darkness , they did not talk . Al Mullins wanted to talk , but he felt the near walls crowding the words back into him . Inside himself he chattered continuously , making excuses , explaining , asking , begging to be let off . He stood with palms flat against the rear wall . Stood up there to be shot . His hands were trembling : he could feel the palms rattling against the wall . He kept saying , " Christ , I did n't mean to shoot him , you know I did n't mean to shoot ! But he rushed at me ! And that guy with the sword ! He rushed at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword coming at his eyes , coming to pin him against the wall . He held his breath until it flashed past him . Then , after a moment , with a faint return of strength , he began again , " He rushed at me ! Did n't he ? " At last he raised his voice so the others could hear him . " Did n't he ? " " Yup , " said Young Harris from under the shelf . Geiger had stopped shoving at the door . He said , " Whatya think they 're up to , huh ? " Nobody answered . " If we only could get word to somebody ! " muttered Geiger . Then he had a bright idea . He reached out his arms , feeling for the cop . " Say ! You got your whistle , ai nt cha ? " Young Harris laughed . Fumbling in his shirt , he found another butt and some matches . He lit the cigarette-end , and sat under the shelf smoking . Geiger had changed his mind about the whistle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris . " Yu want to choke us with that smoke ? " " Yup , " said Harris ; and blew the smoke carefully through the crack under the door . Geiger watched ; then hope came to him . " Say , maybe they 'll think the place is on fire and let us out . Keep it up ! "  | MULLINS tried not to listen to Geiger ; weak and gone as he was in nerve , there was still enough strength left in him so that he felt a pulse of rising anger at the man ; if he could have hit Geiger it would have done him good . " Me , " he thought , " hit anybody . " Then for a while leaning back there against the wall , letting the blackness and the crawling air of the closet go into his brain , he found himself feverishly free of Geiger and all this murder , his thoughts going back in a crazy way to something long forgotten . First there was a feeling that what he had done to-day , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly as it had happened when he was a kid . In the back yard of the house where they lived was a shed filled with empty boxes , sacks , old magazines , rusty tools : his father had been the kind of a man who hung on to all sorts of worthless junk , packing the stuff into the shed until his mother once a year got into a fury and called a ragman and cleaned out the place . Now this was winter , and Al Mullins was building himself a seat on an old sled . What he wanted was a box . He went into the shed to look for one . He hunted around , climbing over mountains of barrels and crates , shifting and digging through  | the clutter , and at last decided on a box that was standing near the doorway : it was just the right size for him . But it was filled with empty bottles . So Al began unpacking the bottles . Just as he was down to the last layer , he noticed a little mouse lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field mouse . There it lay in its nest of wadded felt , and three tiny mice , pink , each no bigger than a finger , lay sucking its milk . Mullins felt now how he had stood as a child at that moment , holding his breath in fascinated abhorrence mingled with tenderness , looking at the creatures in the box . It helped a little that they were field mice , they were n't rats . The light coming through the doorway made everything quite plain : he saw the life-pulse beating under the thin pink delicate skins of the mice ; excited , frightened they were ; up and down their sides went . Ugh , the bare pink of their bodies and heads made a nausea in him ; but yet he watched . He did not want to turn them out . He even went climbing again over the mountain of trash in the shed , moving heavy crates in his search for another box , but there was nothing else so suitable in size . He was in a hurry to finish that sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the box . He did n't want to  | touch the nest with his hands . He turned the box on one side , and gently as he could jerked it so that the nest would slide little by little out onto the floor . At the first turn the mother-mouse , terrified , scuttled out of the nest and disappeared under the mountain of rubbish . He was so startled by her movement that he knocked over the crate ; one of the mice fell tumbling onto the floor of the shed . He could n't bear to touch the thing , and left it there . Grimly , setting all his will to the task , he finished shifting the nest with the other two mice out onto the floor . The tiny animals quivered violently . He seized his box and ran to the farthest corner of the yard ; there he cleaned it , and nailed it onto his sled . But he saw himself now as he had gone back later to the shed and looked , finding the nest empty of mice . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the one knocked to the floor had been killed . For a long time he had felt some unlucky thing would happen to him as punishment . That was when he was a boy . But nothing ever happened . After that memory , Al Mullins ' mind was darkly unpeopled for some time , it was just a blackness , not like the closet , but a wider darkness in which  | he fumbled as in the space of a dream , trying to get hold of something , but with his hands always empty . Then he said aloud , " He 's dead , huh ? " " Yup , " said Harris . " Jeez Christ ! " he said . His palms again began to tremble on the wall . " I did n't mean to shoot the kid ! What for ! " IN the dining room of his flat , Herbert Stratford sat writing . His back was to the door . Every moment he would jerk upright , pen poised , listening . Then he would bend again to his swift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a young boy . He would tend to them . They would not escape justice . The instant he had seen that Joracek woman seize the policeman 's pistol he had known what to do . He had remembered that the power of the pen is mightier than that of the sword . Quietly he had backed toward his door . In the confusion , he congratulated himself , they had not noticed him . He had slipped into his flat , opened his desk . Swiftly he wrote . Time pressed . He must confound them with his document , before it was too late !  | FOUR houses away , in the basement , the janitor Stanley Dobrowsky sat eating his second breakfast . He had finished his rounds up and down the stairs of the six houses in his care , he had fed all the garbage into the incinerator , and come tramping back to his home . His wife was named Maria . She sat across the table , watching him eat . Her eyes followed his hand to his mouth , each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her second youngest child sat on her knee . The child had a hand against her full firm breast . The child , too , watched the man eat . The child 's eyes were very large , black and wondrous shiny , they were like the eyes of the mother . Dobrowsky leaned back for a moment . " Today they throw out the Joraceks , " he said . ' " No . " Her voice was one with her breast , with her eyes , warmly the voice of a woman large and healthy of body . " What they do ? " He shrugged . " Too bad . " Yet in his shrug , in his feeling of goodness for the Joraceks , there was that which said , See , I take care of my family so that they are not thrown out of their house . He tore a piece off the soft bread that she had baked . " Bad times . Terrible , " he said . " Where they go to-night ? " she said . The twoyear-old  | child rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was dim there , and smelled sweetly strangely damp . She passed her hand over the fuzzy blond hairs of the child . Then her eyes became fluid , coursing with a new wish . " Maybe you let them sleep in some empty rooms , " she said to her husband . " Nobody will know . " He ate for a while , without answering her . Then he got up . " I 'm not the boss , " he said . He would go out now to work , to tend furnaces . She arose , holding the child . The only thing was to go out in back of the house , to sit in the courtyard there and try to catch a little sun in the morning . There was a time when her Stanley would not have been afraid to open doors for such homeless people . Now he too was afraid for his job . She wrapped her great shawl around herself , and sat on a canvas stool she had placed in the yard . There was little sun . MARIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All through her life Marie would say , " When I was a girl some one gave his life for me ! " In her years behind the counter at Gimbels she could  | find , in that death , a pride that made her different from the other girls . But it was no good to her if she was lonely some evening without a date to try to bring alive Red Feingold 's love , to feel they would have been so happy living together . " We were childhood sweethearts . He was going to be a television expert . " She might try to summon Red to her at such hours , but only a wooden dummy of him , with painted flaming hair plastered on his skull , would appear . He would kneel at her chair and hold her hand , so tame , so ideal , a man who had given his life for love of her . Even in this moment she could live far into the time when other men would propose to her , and always she would ask the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Her voice , awed at itself , would add , " Well , some one did . " And , " You see , dear , there will always be the memory of that other . Of him . " With a smile of great , of tender sweetness . " You understand ? " And looking into her tragic face , the man would say , " But how you must have suffered ! " " But I loved him , " she would tell the suitor . " I wish , I wish I could love you , but I never can love any one else . " And she would watch him go away . Ruined , ruined her life , ruined of joy , all by that one cruel bullet .  | Oh , she could kill ... ! With her bare hands she could kill ... ! ANNA JORACEK unlocked the door and motioned to the men in the pantry . " You , " she said . " The cop . " Sweat started to his forehead . " Me ? " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending . She was motioning with the gun for him to come out there . He squeezed past Geiger . In a second she had locked the door on the others . " You ca n't do that ! " yelled Geiger , beating on the door . " You 'll swing for it ! The whole bunch of you ! " He stood against the door , waiting , waiting , listening for a shot . Young Harris had rubbed out his cigarette . He sat up , almost straight with eagerness . " Hey ! " Geiger called to him . " Hey ! " Geiger needed some one , any one , to agree with him , to reassure him . They could n't do it ! Not to an officer ! At the same time his head was filled with wild torture-pictures . These Polacks and Russians , they were worse than savages . The pictures tumbled through his mind : bodies found mutilated , his own body found mutilated , long Chinese knives slicing the soles of his feet , people coming at him  | with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already he felt himself blind , wildly he put his hands in front of his face , he could not see the fingers , no it was the darkness of the closet . Then he stood holding his breath , listening for the sound of the man 's screaming , or of a revolver shot . ANNA JORACEK brought the policeman out to the middle of the hallway . Until then she felt she knew what she must do . She walked as through a ritual settled unchangeably by ancient commandment , and she was a priest 's servant . He would be placed against the wall . She would hand the gun to her husband . But just as the policeman came into the hallway Marie Joracek leaped from where she sat . Furious as a bounding cat , she caught at the face of the man , her small hands tore and pounded his face . This was Red 's killer . Mullins did not try to stop her . " I got it coming ! I got it coming ! " Only his hands went up in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small sharp fists , and his body cringed . When the man put up his hands to shield his face , Anna for the first time saw him . He was no longer a form that moved to crumple against the  | wall . The form had turned a face to her , startling , the face of her brother , her husband . She tore the rising pity from herself , but it grew again swiftly . The picture that had been in her mind of the blue form crumpling to the floor no longer made her feel good with a feeling of deep passionate easing ; now she saw only what stood there : a man scared for his life . Joe Joracek came up and pulled Marie from the policeman . He took hold of her two arms from behind and pinned them to her sides . " I 'll kill him ! I 'll kill him ! " the girl cried , but her voice kept shrinking as if her father had pinned it down with her arms . Now the policeman stood before them . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anna said suddenly , " Tell her why did you kill her son . " It was worse than if she had sent a bullet through his back . He stood , dumb , looking at the mother who had raised her head to stare at him with crazy unseeing eyes . " I  --  I  --  " he could n't make his mouth work . " Tell her ! " Anna said . Why did n't they kill him and have done ! His eyes went hunting among all the faces there . Only then he saw , leaning toward him , the warm pleading  | eyes of young Mrs. Novak . He stammered looking at her , but trying to speak to the others , " I  --  Jeez madman , I  --  oh Christ , I lost my nerve . He jumped at me , and the fellow with the sword , and all the rest of you  --  waving that saw  --  Christ , I just lost my nerve . I did n't want to hurt him , why , he had n't done anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked at his hand , as if to see the mistake there . " Yah , a little mistake , " said Mrs. Feldscher . " I got a coupla kids myself , " he begged , still to the small young woman . " Jeez I 'd do anything to make it right . I never wanted to hurt anybody . " " You 're a policeman , huh , " said Mrs. Feldscher . " All you know is to shoot . " " No ! " he said . " That ai n't fair ! Listen , lady , I 've been on the force twelve years and this is the first time I  --  " But his voice fell . " I do n't say that excuses what I did . I was always on a quiet beat . I used to take the kids across the street on their way to school . " " Why did you come here to-day ? " Anna Joracek said . " They sent me with the marshal . They never used to send cops . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get my orders from the lieutenant . " Mrs. Feldscher cut in . " Did he order you to kill this boy ? " It was unfair , her butting in ! " No ! Nobody told me to kill anybody ! Jeez Christ  --  " " Fine ! " she said . " That was just a little extra , to show you did a good job , to show you were a fine policeman ! What do you come here for , to kill innocent people ! Do you ask yourself who they are and who you are ? What is a policeman for , he is supposed to protect people , but you , you are not a policeman , you are a soldier ! The lieutenant tells you , ' Go , shoot ! ' and you will shoot your own brother ! Go , put them out of their houses , ' and you go ! What if to-morrow you will lose your job , in a couple of months the pennies you saved will be gone , and then you will be thrown into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right ? You stand there ashamed with the blood on your hands , you are afraid that any minute we will kill you for killing this boy . But do you know what I say ? I say you did a worse thing than killing this boy . I say people like you should be exterminated before they do any harm . Because you are a coward and you sell yourself to the rotten government that is run by rotten bosses ,  | and you are a traitor who will hold a gun against his own brothers , against poor people like himself , to keep up the power of dirty politicians and racketeers . Why are you here in the world ? What do you live for ? What do people like you live for ? Ca n't you look around yourself and see that thousands of people are starving , plain people , like yourself ? When you are sent out on a dirty job , ca n't you stand up on your feet and say , I wo n't do it ! ' No , you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people like you should be exterminated . You should be shot , not for what you did , but for what you are . " " It is wrong ! " Bertha Pincus cried . " It is not his fault , what he is ! He has killed the boy , that is another thing , for that he should be taken to the law and punished . " Her sister laughed at the word , law . " But how can he help what he is ? He has to live ! We all have to live ! " With all her inward strength , she seemed to be drawing the muscles of her brain out of their beds of soft flesh , to struggle against the harsh power of her sister , who wanted only death . " What good will it do ? " she cried . " We will make ourselves murderers , we will kill him . Will it make anybody happier in the world ? Will it help anybody ? " " Us , it will not make happier , " said Mrs.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will do as we do , and in the end the world will wake up from slavery ! " Tillie Novak put her hand over the policeman 's breast . " But why should he have to die ! Why should it have to be this man ! " she cried out . " Shut up ! " Anna Joracek turned from them . Their words were no help . Before , all had been known within her . Now she had lost her way . She dared not look again at the soft face of the policeman . She could not yet give over the deed to Ida . At last she turned to her husband . " What you think ? " she said . It was not good to be asked . All that time , Joe had held his eyes on the policeman . The words of the women he had not heard . Laws were made so that a man should know what to do . In the old time there was a law , he who kills should be killed . But now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer given to the man to help him , but the man was taken to the law . Joe looked at this man that had killed the boy . Then he looked at Mrs. Feingold . Anna Joracek followed her husband 's thought . She said to Ida , " What should we do with him ? " Ida Feingold did not move her head . She too  | had not heard all the spoken words . They had danced , danced off the tight drum that was her heart . Black gall of bitterness filled that heart . First her husband had gone away from her , and now they had killed her Red . Would the bullet that pierced the policeman 's body also make a hole in her own breast , would it free the black gall to flow out from her heart as his blood flowed out from his body ? Would it bring her ease ? She heard their words : " What do you live for ? " They were talking about happiness , about other people in the world ! She looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wanted to live . Plenty of times after having reported his evidence as arresting officer Mullins had stepped back against the rail and watched the prisoner standing below the judge waiting for sentence to be spoken . Mostly vags they had been , and beggars without license , people that got a couple of days or a couple of weeks in jail . But no matter how slight the case , Mullins sensed in every prisoner that same special feeling , a kind of concentrated terror , when the man stood there waiting for the final word to be spoken ; and often the thought had passed through the policeman 's mind , how tough it must be for a guy standing up there charged with something big , maybe murder , a guy waiting  | to hear the judge say twenty years , or life , or the chair . Now he knew that feeling , standing before this red-faced woman , and now he wanted his life . What do you live for ! they had cried at him . What should a man live for : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself ! He had never thought there was anything wrong in being a policeman . That was on his face now : I am not a bad man , I admit I shot the boy , I got punishment coming ! Then he would quit the force ! If they would let him go , he would quit the force to-morrow ! Take no more chances killing people ! " You know I did n't mean to hurt him ! " he cried to the woman . " I would n't even of pulled out my gun if Geiger had n't made me . If the kid had n't yanked the club out of my hand ! " Unwittingly he had touched the right word , Geiger . " That 's it ! " cried Mrs. Pincus . " Why is he to blame more than the others ? They are just as bad as he ! " Anna too felt a strange response to the name . All this time something had been holding back her hatred from this man , and now she knew , it was because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other man , the big fat talking fellow . " That 's true , " Mrs. Feldscher admitted . " The other two of them are as much responsible as this one . As much as if they had pulled the trigger themselves . " Still Ida Feingold said nothing . Anna turned on Mullins . " You stay there , " she said , and made him sit on the stairs . Then she went into the flat to get the other two men . TILLIE NOVAK moved nearer to the policeman . She kept herself from looking too much at his face . He had said he would quit the force . What would he do ? How would he take care of his wife and two children ? " Say , " she whispered to him , " It 'll be all right . Do n't worry . " She smiled quickly to him , and looked away . But he was no longer fearing what they would do to him . Being made to sit down had somehow broken the fear of death . They would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing for them to do . He did n't believe any one could do that , just as he did n't believe it of himself , not even now . But as he sat there he was overcome by a feeling of being vastly alone , and then the real  | terror of his deed engulfed him . He seemed to see the boy constantly in the act of falling ; the shot body seemed suspended right there in front of him , right there over the spot where it had lain ; and he had a sense of himself sitting forever just as he was sitting at this moment tightly gripping his knees and staring at the falling body in front of him , the falling body that never fell . He was jerked from his obsession by the small warm voice of Mrs. Novak . " If you want , I 'll call help ! " she whispered excitedly . He looked up to her and tried to smile . " No , lady . Thanks . " She seemed a little hurt . He added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " JERRY GEIGER heard some one coming to the door again . He gripped the knob with both hands , pulling to keep the door shut . " Who 's there ? " he said . Anna spoke . " You come out now . " " Where 's Mullins ? The policeman . " " You come out . " " What did you do with him ? " " You come out now or I shoot ! " she said . His fingers went limp on the knob . She drew  | the door open . He stood there with his hands up . " Do n't shoot ! " he said . He was fat . She had not noticed before , he was fat . There were white cushions of flesh on his upraised palms . There was a gold ring on one fat finger . Anna saw the little old fellow squatting under the shelf . " You come out too , " she said . Harris scrambled to his feet and was ready . He was nobody , she thought . A bum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs , new strength came into him . These people were afraid to do anything . The best plan was to humor them a little , but at the same time to show them they could n't bulldoze him . " I just want to remind you folks , " he said , " you better be careful what you do here , because we men are here as officers of the government , and every one of you will be held responsible for any trouble that  --  " " Shut up , " said Anna . Startled , he shut his mouth . Then Anna said , " Who are you ? " He did not answer . " Who sent you here to murder innocent children ? " Mrs. Feldscher snapped . Trying to be easy , he replied after a moment ,  | " I 'm the city marshal 's assistant , and I 'm here as part of my job . If you people had n't been so foolish trying to resist the government nothing would have happened . You all know that boy got hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The officer shot in self-defense . If you do n't let us out of here pretty soon they 'll be sending a squad to look for us , and then there 'll be plenty of trouble . " Mrs. Feldscher said , " So you 're the city marshal 's assistant , huh ? How did you get your job ? " He recognized her . The bolshevik that had made a speech from the downstairs door , too yellow even to join the fight . " None of your damn business ! " he said . " How much do you get paid a week , " she taunted , " for throwing poor people out of their houses ? Ten dollars extra for each one , is n't it ? " He bit his tongue . " And in his spare time , " continued Mrs. Feldscher , " he passes out cigars for the ward boss , and gets bums to vote for the organization , so he can keep his job . " He burst out , " Say , what do you think you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Maybe this is a trial . Maybe you are on trial for murder . And here you wo n't bribe anybody . "  | He looked at them , from one to the other . Later , if he got out , he would tell the boys what it felt like to be in a lunatic asylum . Now he figured the best thing was to stall for time . She was n't the whole works , this woman , he felt that . The others were only letting her talk . They were watching him . " I did n't pick this job out for myself , " he said . " I only got it this year , they needed some extra marshals on account of all the dispossesses . I did n't have no choice in the matter , practically . A man has to take care of his family . " A question had come in Bertha Pincus 's mind . From where , she did not know . But the answer would prove something great , she felt . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment seemed a place where everybody did not have to be unhappy . Her sister , everybody had to listen to the question . " If you got a job killing people in the electric chair , " Mrs. Pincus asked Geiger , " would you do it ? " He looked down . " No , " he said . " I guess I would n't do that . " " Even if your family was starving ? " He was silent . He felt the brown puzzled eyes of the man Joracek looking into him . He spoke  | honestly , the smirk gone from inside himself . " I do n't know , " he said . " No man ever knows what he 'd do if he came to the limit . " Joracek felt he could speak to this man now . " How many children you got ? " he asked . " Four . Oldest boy goes to college . That keeps me stepping . " " What 's he going to be ? " put in Mrs. Feldscher . " Lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl works . " " Yes ? That 's fine , mister marshal , and where does your girl work ? " It slipped from him before he could catch it . " Why , she works for the city , too . " He smiled . " But she 's gon na be married pretty soon . That 'll leave a job for some one . " Anna looked to Joe . " He 's no good , " she said . Joe waited . Jerry Geiger smiled blandly , giving himself confidence . He knew they were whispering about him . Just one more touch , he felt , and he could get himself out of this jam . Suddenly an idea came to him . " What does your husband do ? " he said to Anna . " He 's a building worker . " " No job , huh ? " " Eight months , he 's out of work . " She answered  | him suspiciously , as if not granting him the right to ask . " Who 'd he work for last ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? Was it for this her son had died ? Anna Joracek would not let him go any further . " What you care ? " she asked sharply . " Oh , " he smiled , " I was thinking , maybe I can fix up your husband with a city job . He had said the wrong thing . He felt that at once . The worst thing he could have said . They were all coming at him . The mother had risen from her chair . The Joracek woman was coming straight at him . He thought it was his last moment . " You , you go to hell , you dirty bastard ! " said Anna Joracek . Ida Feingold raised her lips over her teeth to spit at him , to spit at the low vile dirt that he was , dirt full of worms . Anna Joracek , motioning to the wall , said , " Get over there . " They could n't . They could n't stand him up against the wall like a nigger and shoot him to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body began to wriggle and creep . He felt tears going to fall out of his eyes , and in a breaking voice he began to cry . " Do n't kill me !  | Do n't kill me ! I did n't do anything ! I did n't shoot the kid ! I did n't hurt anybody ! For God 's sake , do n't kill me ! " All compressed in his heart was the prayer for a miracle . " I used to be a good Catholic once ! " he was saying to himself . " When I was a boy I was a Catholic ! " He thought wildly , Maybe if I say a word , name a Saint  - -  Then he blurted out , " Why do n't you kill him ! He 's the one that shot your boy ! Why do n't you kill him , not me ! " That instant Anna could have shot him . He was nothing at all . A rooster that runs over the yard flapping and squawking until you seize it by the throat and lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least had been something of a man . But even in that moment , while he was standing against the wall , while the other one , the policeman , had leaped to his feet as if to stop them , while little Mrs. Novak had come running forward gasping with her hand to her mouth , in that moment the old man Herbert Stratford broke in upon them . He waved a white sheet of paper . " Stop ! " he commanded them hoarsely . " As a citizen of this republic I command you all to stop ! " So strange was his coming , that the thought of  | his madness did not fully reach them until he had had his effect upon them . They waited , staring . " I have been listening ! " said Mr. Stratford . " I have heard every word ! And I am outraged ! Here are two officers , representatives of our government ! In the heart of revolt and violence they have allowed themselves to be taken prisoner by a pack of ruthless foreigners ! I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them the first tentative movements against his sudden wild spell . " I am a veteran of two campaigns ! I have risked my life upon the altar of war to make this republic safe for law-abiding citizens . And what do I see ? Murder and revolution at my very door ! " He surveyed them with his fanatic , commanding gleam . Perhaps through this speech not one of them was really listening to him . To Jerry Geiger the raving old man had come as a heaven-sent savior , an answer to his belated prayer to some saint he had been unable to name . Mullins , slow-witted , stared with paralyzed mind at the man ; but gradually it became clear to him that this had been the wild body waving the sword , and that the sword that had seemed to pierce to his very eyes had even then been brought to his aid ! And it was the sword that had made him shoot ? !  | Joe Joracek 's thoughts were still on Geiger . It was like if you were run against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plunge against the machine , smash out the headlights , smash the window-glass , strike blows on the body , would that give you satisfaction ? Smashing , while the automobile just stood there ? Like that fat fellow was just standing against the wall . " Therefore ! " cried Mr. Stratford , " I have prepared this letter to the department of justice , setting forth the facts in regard to the tragic events in Marks Gardens this day . No matter what you may do to me , this letter is on its way , and justice shall be dealt to the guilty ones . " He began to read from the sheet of paper in his hand . The only ones hearing him seemed to be Young Harris , with a sad amusement , and Mrs. Feldscher , with an air of breaking in and arguing . " As this letter is written the house is in a state of virtual siege . The police have been captured by the revolutionists whose names and descriptions are here appended ! But the truth shall be known ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer who was forced to shoot in self-defense just as the undersigned was approaching to the rescue . The guilty  --  "  | But he got no further . Young Harris sprang up and tore the letter from his hands . " Kill me if you will ! " cried Stratford . " A copy exists ! The truth will out ! " " Aw , go write a letter to Santa Claus ! " Harris snarled at him . Then , one of the few times in his life , he began to talk . " There 's your answer , " he said to Ida Feingold and the Joraceks , to all those standing there . His tone was something of a sneer , and yet not unconcerned for them . " A bunch of crap like that , does it deserve any better than it gets ? " He flung the crumpled piece of paper through the doorway into the room where the dead boy lay . " It 's a fine time to wake up to yourselves , when your kid is dead in there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a year with no rain in sight . Sure , go busting around with your fists trying to take it out on the first guy you can reach , and look what you grab , a couple of harmless saps like that , the only difference between them and you is that they can take a little better care of their skins . " Go on , make it even , shoot him , shoot the cop , shoot a couple of dozen of them , a hell of a lot it 'll mean ! " He stopped , and they were afraid he would n't say any more . He had ceased to appear  | so lifeless and old when he began to speak ; come to look at him , Joracek thought , he is no older than I am . " What should we do ? " Anna said . The man laughed . " Do ? There ai n't a thing you can do . They got you all beat . Bury your dead . " And he flung back to the stairs and sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him now you would think he 'd crept into the hallway from the street looking for some place to sleep , you would n't think it was he that had spoken . " Somebody made it like this , " Anne said . He looked up , weary . His face wore a small wry smile again . " Sure somebody made it . Somebody made the war , too . " Since the bum had opened his mouth Mullins had been wondering at a response in himself to this man , a response as to one who had known deeply what he had only begun to know . Now he understood , the bum had been in the war , had got further than the rear lines . " Sure , " Young Harris went on , " you want to blame somebody , you want to kick somebody in the pants . Well , who started this little scrap today ? Who sent these guys to chuck you out ? " " He 's right ! " cried Mrs. Feldscher . " He 's right . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you poor sap , " Young Harris said to Joracek . " And me , well , maybe I 'd of been a bum anyway . " " Simon Marks ! " cried Mrs. Feldscher . " He kicks you out of Marks Gardens ! " For one instant , angry life came back to Ida Feingold 's face . " Sure ! " She turned on Joracek . " Marks kicked you out of your job ! " She heard herself and sank back , sore at her thoughts for having , even for a moment , left her dead boy . " Aw , him or any other name , " said Harris . " It is n't one or the other . For cry sake , the way they run things is enough to make anybody a lousy bolshevik . What the hell , if you got to take it out on somebody you might as well take it out on one of them . " A chill went through Anna when she heard that name uttered : Simon Marks . Those sounds seemed to suck all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown in her during this last short hour , that had sought a way outward , now flew to that name , there it belonged . How many times a day now , for how many months of days , had the dread and the hope in that name hung over her ! Will he give you a job to-morrow ? Will he let us stay in the house ? Will he begin to build again ? Even now she knew it was nothing but a  | name , a great meaning that had grown for them around a sound , around two words ; but there her hatred belonged . As surely as if she had gripped his arm and spoken , Joe knew the thought that was in Anna . To him , the hatred had not come so quickly , but the sound of the name had stopped that in him which had been seeking . There he remained . If a machine runs into you what is the use of taking a hammer and smashing at the machine . It is the driver that is to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be smashed . " It ai n't going to do you any good , " said Young Harris . " Hell , y ' ca n't do a damn thing that 'll do any good . " He seemed to be chewing on something for a while . " That 's the way I am , " he ended . But anything more he might have said would have been as unheard as the jabber of Herbert Stratford . The one thing he could tell them , Harris had uttered . He was like a native met by a lost traveler ; the native points the road for the traveler , and then wanders off down his own path . That name was still in Anna 's mind : Simon Marks . She went up to the fat marshal who stood there trying to look as if he were master of himself . " Go home , " she said .  | The words bounced against Jerry Geiger like a gun going off but shooting a blank . Then ease spread through his flesh . Sure , they would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to swing for it . And the strength rose in him so fast that his next thought was of how he would come right back with a squad and pinch the house . He would throw them all in jail and show them  - -  But maybe there was some trick in it ? These Polacks were as bad as wops . Maybe they only wanted to get him out of the house , and then , down some side street , so no one could tell they did it  - -  The Joracek woman was standing before the cop . " Go home , " she said to him . Al Mullins was not startled or frightened by her . " Jeez , if there 's anything I can do  --  " he said . " Go home . " Home . That meant go back to everything as though nothing had happened . Would he have the nerve when he got into the station to walk up to the desk and turn in his star , then go home and say to Helen , " I quit the force " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would turn in nothing more than a report of the shooting of the boy , that he would sit through a short investigation  | where Geiger would get up and prove what heroes the two of them had been fighting off a mob of radicals all morning , the shooting would be pronounced justifiable , he might even get a mark of merit , they might even come to regard him as one of the quiet , reliable men of iron nerve , one of the boys to be sent on emergency calls . God ! that might be his eternal torture , having for the rest of his days to go around never a second free of the fear of the clanging bell , the screaming whistle , the sound of shots from the gun in his own hand ! and the sight of that body , falling , suspended over the landing , never falling ... . " Come on , let 's get out of here . " Geiger took him by the arm and stayed close to him . " Come on , you too ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , still working his mouth as if he were chewing on a bit of straw , went down after them . As they went down the stairs , Geiger whispered to Mullins , " We better beat it over to the station to make a report . I 'll stick by you all right , Mullins . " He felt in his vest pocket for the cigars . IDA FEINGOLD watched the three men go down the stairs . It seemed that they were carrying her  | boy out with them , to the grave , and her body was so heavy she could not rise to follow them . " I do n't want to kill anybody , " she thought . THE strain was gone from the heart of Tillie Novak . As Mullins passed her she dared to look deep into his eyes ; then she felt his troubled look way inside herself , with terrified joy she felt it real like only two other things in her life had felt real ; like the first night of love ; like the first time her baby stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her baby . OUTSIDE , pressed against the front doorway of the building as if to avoid rain , Mrs. Kusick waited . When she heard people coming down the stairs she scuttled quickly away , pretended to be walking along the street . She heard them come out . After a moment she risked turning her head . She counted them : the three men . They were all safe ! She slowed her step so they would catch up with her . " I called the police , " she gasped as they passed . " I climbed out the back window and called the police . They 'll be here any minute . "  | FROM the front of his basement the janitor saw the three men going away , and glancing up the street he saw that the sidewalk was bare . Maria would be glad if he told her this . His wife was sitting outside in the little courtyard , she was holding the baby now , giving it suck . There , in the cold , her body glowed , her breast was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child , so close to her warmth . He saw her eyes still troubled toward him , as they had been all morning . " Well , those men they went away , " he said . " Joracek is still in the house . " He stood boldly , triumphantly before her , letting her feel , and feeling himself that somehow he had had a hand in bringing it about that the men should go away leaving the Joraceks unmolested . " Yah , good , " she said . Then Maria looked down and kissed the head of the baby . UPSTAIRS in that corridor , as soon as the sounds of the men were gone , Anna took hold of Joe , and went aside with him into their flat . " It is not the policeman , but Simon Marks that has killed him , "  | she said . And she handed the policeman 's pistol to her husband . Then she went and got her pocketbook that was on the dresser in the other room . There was a dime in the pocketbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him , " she said .  | EARLY that day Simon Marks had set out from his apartment . He had been up at seven o'clock . Like he always said , " I stick to my habits . Get up early . Get a lot done in the morning . " From the days when he used to get up at seven o'clock to take the iron grating off the windows and open the doors of his pawnshop , till the days when he was Simon Marks , Inc. , giving the girls in his office a pain in the neck because no matter how early they came he was already there waiting for them , he had not changed his habits . Mrs. Marks had changed . She had learned that when you live on Park Avenue it is a shame before the servants to get up sooner than twelve o'clock . Plenty of times she had talked to Simon , begging him to act a little more dignified , like an important head of a corporation . " You do n't have to get up so early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You can take it easy now ! " And whenever she had to find a new cook it was a terrible job to get one that would wake up at half-past six , in time to have coffee ready for Mr. Marks .  | To Simon Marks that early morning was maybe the only enjoyable part of the day . Maybe it was what he lived for . When terrible thoughts came upon him , especially in these last months , and he was almost on the point of swallowing a little too much headache powder and dying of heart trouble , he would sit back in a chair and try to feel that it was early in the morning , he had just been in the shower bath . That was the one new thing he got out of life after he got so far up in the world : the shower bath was a pleasure . And it was a pleasure to have a fresh shirt every day ; in the pawn shop he had used to change his shirt only once to twice a week , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer when it was so terrible hot and the sweat came under the sleeves , maybe three times a week . But now every day . That was one thing about him , he was clean and neat . He liked everything compact , clean , and neat . To some people it would seem things were too small the way he liked them . Rooms in a house ; he did n't want large rooms . Even his office was very small , only a space for a desk and a couple of chairs . But this gave him the feeling that everything was small enough so he could control it right under his hand .  | That was the best time , in the morning , when he came from his shower wearing his clean shirt , and sat down before the small table in the breakfast room with nobody else . The coffee stood on the table , where the girl had already left it for him . And a roll on a plate beside the coffee . That was all he wanted . There he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window he could see over the city . He never liked the sun that shone too strong , and at this time of the morning there was never too much sun . Outside everything looked even , graylike , and the sky looked graylike and not too far up , it looked almost like a calcimined ceiling . When he sat there like that he had no wife and he had no son and daughter . He had only himself and the city . Often he cast his eye on stretches of street down there , where there were only small houses , few skyscrapers . In back of his mind he had an idea , sometimes when Marks Gardens had grown up and he could reinvest his money , he would take whole blocks down there and build them into model tenements , with even more conveniences than there were in Marks Gardens . In the last year of troubles it did not sadden him to look out over those streets ; his vaguely distant plan would come to his mind , and it was  | as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something could be done , was an assurance that some day he would do it . That morning Simon Marks had taken his coffee slowly , and yet with a fear of lingering . There was no more ease in the house , even at his seven o'clock breakfast . He could feel that the girl was moving about in the kitchen ; any minute she might decide to come in and ask him for wages . As he drank his coffee he was ready at a coming noise from back there to jump from his chair and show himself in a hurry to get to his office . The girl did not bother him ; and , when at last he stood up to go , he remained standing and looking out the window at the stretch of unimproved streets . Thus he stood for some moments , with his fingers on the table . The girl thought he had gone , and came in to take the cup and plate . He jerked his fingers from the table , buttoned his coat , and went out . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes too late in the morning , or they would look at him as if he was sick . He could not go down to his office , either . For what should he do down to his office ? The stenographer would hand him the few letters that were only advertisements and bills , and then she would  | look at him wondering if he could pay her any money that week . He could not even pretend to dictate letters any more . To whom should he write letters , and for what ? If he had a letter to write to somebody he would do it himself , by hand , with bad spelling even , for he would be writing only to a few friends who might help him if they could . Yah , if they could . And what friends ? A man has no friends . Only a few people in the world who fight together with you because it is better for them to do that than to fight against you , you owe them so much money , maybe . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet written to Rosenblatt helped him a little to face the elevator man . With Rosenblatt , it would not be because they were relatives . What business man is not a relative either of the Rosenblatts or of the Strauses ? That was only a matter somewhere vaguely of aunts marrying cousins . But one time he had gone to see Rosenblatt at his office , and just as they had finished their deal Rosenblatt had been going out to lunch , and had said , " Come along . " Without ceremony Rosenblatt had taken Simon Marks down on Fourteenth Street to a dairy restaurant where the tables had white porcelain tops , and baskets of all  | kinds of bread and rolls stood on the tables . There they had eaten potato pancakes together . " A man like myself , " Simon Marks had thought all through lunch , and every moment he sat there his blood had been pounding in wonder that after all Rosenblatt was a man like himself , very much like himself , a little Jew who had once owned a shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rosenblatt . That thought made him feel like a general who is playing with a small enemy , pretending to be on the verge of defeat , but all the time knowing , with a smile behind his mouth , that he has only to send to his brother general for a reserve army . And yet he might not write to Rosenblatt at all . It might be that just knowing he could have done it would be enough , and with that knowledge he would go to defeat , the letter unwritten . That was what gnawed inside Simon Marks : he was not sure if at the last minute , when there was no other way out , if even then he would do it . Now he did not want to go to the office . He began walking , and walked past the first station . But it was already half-past seven ; if he was not there before eight o'clock the girls would begin coming in and they would make knowing faces at each other , and if he came in afterwards he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . He had a right to stay away if he wanted . He was the boss . In the end , at a quarter of eight , he jumped into the subway , and all the way downtown he kept pulling out his watch , to make sure he would not be a minute late . When the girl brought him the letter that contained the final notice he could not even have the relief of jumping up from his desk and running around the room with his hands to his hairless head . No . He had to sit there and look at the piece of paper for a minute and then put it aside on top of the other letters that had to be answered , doing nothing more than make a ticking sound through the space between his teeth . And all that while he felt as if he were behind the counter on that street under the elevated tracks , and a letter had just come saying the rent was raised , and he ran from behind the counter and ran up and down the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make long speeches to his wife , telling her how he was ruined , and at the tinkling of the bell ran into the store again to be suddenly and suspiciously silent before a customer that had a watch to sell . Now he was a big business man and had to sit  | still and keep his face still no matter what happened . Nevertheless the minute she had gone out of the room , and she went out of his private office quickly to-day as if  --  he thought  --  she knew something of what had happened , she knew too much , that girl  --  that same minute he was up standing in front of the window , walking back and forth in front of the window . The letter was from a lawyer for a group of creditors that had brought the matter to court and they wanted him to turn over the deed for Marks Gardens into the hands of a receiver . So . Burst , his big bubble . Simon Marks put on his hat and his coat , waited until there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through without being stopped ; before he opened his door he took off his hat again so he might be putting it on as he went through the office , so they could see he was on very urgent business , things were not all over with him yet , so they would not even dare ask him when he would be back . But as he went no one called after him about telephone messages or appointments . To-day he could feel as he rushed through the office that the two girls merely looked up from the magazines they were reading , and the boy was filling in a  | crossword puzzle and did not even raise his head . Loafer ! Simon Marks walked until he came to Fourteenth Street . He had not started out to walk there , but only to walk ; except when he came up far enough he decided he would go there to the bank on Fourteenth Street . In that bank he had a small personal account , separate from all his business accounts . It was a superstition with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This had been his first bank account in New York . And afterward , when he got into big business with deeds and mortgages and debentures and securities , he had kept for his own personal use for small change that account in the bank on Fourteenth Street . He went inside , stood by one of the glass-topped writing tables , and drew out of his pocket the small check book he kept for this account . He noticed there were only a couple of blank checks left . Then he looked at his balance and saw that it was eleven dollars and thirty-one cents . Hastily he made out a check to cash for ten dollars . And he took what remained of the check book and tore it across and dropped it in the little wastebasket under the table . There were four wickets marked Deposits and  | Withdrawals . The clerks behind three of those wickets were old , they had been there for many years and knew his name and his face . He went to the last wicket where there was a young clerk who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a man who was his own height but at least three times his girth . The man was without a hat , he must have been a delicatessen storekeeper from the neighborhood , who had run in to make his daily deposit in order to get the cash out of the store . Like that , without a hat , Simon Marks had used to run to this bank . Although the day was chilly , there came a rancid sweat smell from the heavy fellow in front of him . Simon Marks found himself looking carefully at the other man 's head and face . It was a huge head , blond , with wide lips that were the same pink color as the rest of the face , everything was the same color except for the flat eyes , which seemed to be little dark chunks of dough floating in unclear soup . Somehow , not only because the man was so fat , but maybe because of the color of his lips and the way his mouth hung partly open , he made Simon Marks think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marveled at the way his side-turned face was without a flicker of life , it just sat there , a chunk of flesh stuck on the  | shoulders , with small eyes pointed into the barred window opening . The fat man 's fist held a bankbook in which were folded several checks and a fairly thick wad of bills . " And he has money to put in the bank , " Simon Marks kept thinking . At last the delicatessen storekeeper pushed the money under the wicket , received back his book , and looked closely at the notation of the deposit , which Simon Marks fleetingly saw was a continuation of a long steady row of deposits ; then the man left the bank , his face still dead like a head of pork with buttons for eyes , set in a gentile butcher 's window . He had no dreams of building model tenements . Simon Marks passed his check through the window . While his face did not show he was afraid the clerk would look at him to see if he looked all right for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely he knew the name Simon Marks , Inc . But no gleam of recognition appeared on the face of the young man ; he merely stamped and spiked the check , then reached into the drawer for two five-dollar bills , without looking up the account to see if the balance covered that amount . Sometimes they looked it up and sometimes they did n't . Simon Marks wondered would the clerk  | have looked up his Account if he had passed in a check for a hundred dollars ? Perhaps he should come back later , come back several times during the day and cash checks for himself , now with one clerk , now with another ? Or would the other clerks , who knew him , already be on the watch ? Would a secret bit of paper have been passed around , names to watch , his name among others , so that the tellers might carefully , smiling brightly , say to him , " Sorry , Mr. Marks , did n't you know your account ? ? " And if he got a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had already taken the two five-dollar bills and put them in his wallet . He walked briskly and hastily from the bank so that none of the vicepresidents he knew should have a chance to hail him . Fourteenth Street was crowded . Yet he remembered it later in the day as though he had been the only one , walking on the street , as though the street had become an old-country fair , and he was the single customer that strayed through the narrow path crowded with stalls . Everywhere hawkers sprang before him , sometimes surrounding him , so that he had to force his way onward . Now a woman with a suitcase open on the sidewalk shook an armful of socks in front of his face crying ,  | " Twelve pair for one dollar ! A dozen for a dollar ! " Now a negro with a goldfish bowl on a tripod shook some packets before his face crying , " Overnight she grows , Overnight she grows ! " Immediately after the negro was a parrot on a stand telling fortunes . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawkers , Minnie had a heart as big as a whale ! while a man without legs , pulled along on rollers by a dog , held up pencils for sale . Here , two hawkers , one armless and the other on a crutch , were standing talking together , forgetting to ply their trade , and by them stood a red-headed boy selling shaving cream from a great carton on the sidewalk , " Now ten cents , Now ten cents ! " and his cry turned into the cry of a small boy who carried a roll of wide yellow sheets of paper on which were the words of popular songs . I 'm gon na go home to mamma  - -  Eyes turned , eyes turned , all of them , the armless one , the legless one , the woman , the boys , the parrot-man , while they sang their wares , their eyes turned from left to right , from right to left , regularly as an electric fan on a pivot machine , ' Cause mamma loves me best ! If the eyes saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted , behind the policeman everything opened again , a dozen a dollar , a dollar a  - -  The window of every store was covered with huge selling-out signs , and from the doorway of every store radio megaphones cried out the news of the sale , the auction , the bargain , the fire , the disaster , the gives up , sang out the latest song , Minnie had a heart  --  Simon Marks floated in the sounds , they enclosed him all around . From a jewelry store a man darted out to seize his elbow , from a clothing store a man came toward him with pairs of pants . And everywhere the newsboys running against him , and men dangling necklaces of beads that were like pearls for five cents . Through this went Simon Marks , downward , eastward , feeling all the time as if he would take nickels from his pockets , hordes , tubfuls of nickels , and give away , give away . No one bought . No one ever bought . This street had come to be his life and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantically dangling the beads , the songs , the pocket-knives , the shaving cream , the frozen candy , the magic flowers , the neckties , the pairs of pants , the quarter watches , turning his eyes from left to right , from right to left , while no one ever bought . Down among the streets he went . On Third  | Street he stood in front of a house he had once owned . For many years he had owned that house , paying off mortgages , taking new mortgages . There was one window , the third story up , on the left , where , for some reason , the shades never fitted . All the Sunday mornings he had spent in the basement of that house , taking apart shades , sawing them down to make them fit that window ! Every time a new tenant moved in , new shades . And on the second floor there was a faucet that was all the time needing new washers . What had changed ? By a piece of paper , a deed , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But how if he would go in there now , up the dark hallway , and knock on each door and say " How do you do " to Mrs. Pechter and Mrs. Lipschitz and Mrs. Finkelstein , and collect the rent , and tell one that next month , not this month , she could have her kitchen painted , and tell the other that he would take care of the door-handle right away himself , then go look in the basement shed for a screw-driver . What if he did that ? What was there to make the house no longer his ? But when he thought he saw a face staring at him from behind window curtains , he quickly moved along . Nevertheless , all that afternoon , possessed by  | his loneliness , he went up and down those streets , passing hastily with furtive glances in front of all those houses he had owned , traded , shared ; this one he had got by a smart trick when he had held a second mortgage and taken up the first mortgage , this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been nearly fooled on but had got rid of it by a smart deal , so he had moved upward , upward to the Gardens . All through the morning and the early afternoon he had walked , upward , upward weaving in a meandering pattern among the streets , but nevertheless constantly tending upward , from Sixth Avenue to West End , weaving toward Amsterdam , toward Riverside , through the nineties , through the hundreds , shuttling along the trail of houses he had owned , until at last he found himself at the beginning of the bridge . On the other side , the very sight of those white perfect streets , those solid houses , set down perfectly in line one after the other , would make him know that everything was all right . This he possessed . He would have to walk across the bridge . And then , for the first time , he felt his weariness . Miles he had walked , in and out among the streets ; now he stood on the bridge and knew himself without strength . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost he was afraid to go there . All that was no longer his . The whole thing might have vanished , like a piece of paper blown out of his hand . Paper . The piece of paper he had to surrender . He kept it in the apartment . An old habit , from the very first days , when he had kept valuable papers , the guarantees of his possessions , in an iron box in the flat behind the store . Those documents seemed a part of the family , to be kept in the same place as his wife and children , rather than in the office with business , or in a stranger 's place , the bank . That was what he had to do . He had to go home , and get those papers . He took out his watch , his fine watch thin as paper . Late , it had come to be , and where had he been all day ? He stood on the bridge , so broad , so wide it was ; just as an ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to another , but was in itself a place , so this bridge was not a stick from shore to shore , but itself a shore , a place with benches . His eyes went dizzy looking up into the immense girders ; should he look below ? He stood for a long time , maybe hours , looking down at the far water , at the stones and bare twiggy bushes by the water 's edge . All exact as though made in miniature , all so very  | far away ; it could be looked at with a telescope ! That was the country down there , a river , a stony shore , wild stones and trees . Simon Marks remained there until dusk came ; then he left .  | ALL right , take it easy now , " the lieutenant said . " You pulled out your gun ? " Mullins was slumped in a chair beside the lieutenant 's desk . It was an old-fashioned roll-top desk , stuffed full of papers . On some of the pigeonholed documents Mullins could see a film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy . Sometimes the lieutenant called him Al . Seven years Mullins had been under Hayes . Before that , there had been a man named Swanson who was cold and meticulous and on the other side of a wall between himself and his men . Swanson was a captain in another district now . Hayes was old and easy , but Mullins never got over being to Hayes as if he was Swanson , being like a schoolboy to a teacher . When Hayes called him Al he could never feel easy . " After he pulled the club out of my hand I pulled out my gun , " Mullins said . He did not mention Geiger 's command to pull out the gun .  | Through a partition he could hear Geiger 's voice where the marshal sat in the back room telling the boys about the affair . But Geiger seemed out of the whole thing now . Mullins wanted some one else . His eyes went all over the little dark office as if to find some one . On the wall there were a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company lined up on special occasions : anniversaries , field days . Mullins kept looking for himself in the wide lines of the group pictures . He had some of those pictures at home , he remembered , he could pick himself out easy at home . " Yeah . Well , you had to pull out your gun , " the lieutenant said . " Yeah . I guess I had to . " " And then they jumped you and you had to shoot . " " Yeah . I guess I had to . " His eyes came away from the picture , and looked for a scared moment into the old , fat-pouched eyes of the lieutenant . Almost , he felt as if he could break out and talk . " Now what was this business of locking up you guys ? " the lieutenant said . " Aw , that was nothing , " Mullins said . " It was just for a couple of minutes . After the kid was killed they grabbed the gun away from me and  | locked us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . You ca n't blame them . They let us go after a while . " But the lieutenant 's eyes were a little harder , smaller . " They still have your gun ? " " Yeah . " The lieutenant swung heavily in his smooth swivel chair . He reached for the telephone . " I 'll send a couple of the boys up to investigate , " he said . Then he added , with a sidewise look that was like calling Mullins Al , " You do n't want to go back there ? " " No , " said Mullins . " Say ? " he was going to ask , he was going to ask something . This was the moment . If he did n't talk now , he could never talk . Before the lieutenant picked up the telephone he had to say his words . He had to say : " Listen , Hayes , I 'm through . You see how it is . I just want to get cleared of this mess , and then I 'll step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or else he must ask , " Say , lieutenant , ca n't you put me on some kind of an inside job , a desk job or anything , I  --  " But the lieutenant 's face was an answer to him , before he spoke . " What ? " the lieutenant asked , looking slowly , easily at him . " Nothing , " Mullins said . " You 'll have to stick around until the boys  | come back with some kind of a report . Then you can go home and tell it to the wife . I guess you did enough for one day , " the lieutenant said . Again , for an instant , his eyes seemed to come toward Mullins , to make themselves open for him . But , as if to cover that softness , he turned away and picked up the phone . MULLINS had to go through the back room . " ? just faced it out , " Geiger was saying . " Just nerve . Iron nerve , that 's all . " He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hell , any man can do it if he 's got the stuff in him . They 're nothing but a pack of wild animals . Keep cool , stare them straight in the eye , and they back down . " Mullins was staring at Geiger 's leg , swinging easily back and forth . Geiger looked down ; for an instant he was surprised to see his leg there , moving so freely , so alive . Mullins went out . " Of course , for a minute there when they had us backed against the wall , it looked as if it was all up with us , " Geiger said . " That crazy bolshevik dame that grabbed Mullins ' gun right out of his hand  --  of course he could n't help it , they had us about sixteen to one , but , believe me , if I had a gat in my fist there would of been more than one  | of them laid out ready for the undertaker . Believe me  --  " " How many of them did you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the city news reporter asked . Geiger leaned back , as if counting them in his mind 's eye . " Yeah . About that many . " He suddenly lowered his voice . " Listen , buddy , that thing was no accident . Those people did n't just happen to be there . Somebody organized that riot , see ? They had one dame there just to stand up and make speeches , inciting them all the time with that crap about capitalists and all that bull . Say ! I 'm going to clean out that place . I 'm going to see that a full investigation  --  " Two cops came out of the lieutenant 's office . They were grinning , as at some joke just told . " Say , Geiger , dya want to come back with us ? " they said . " We 're going over there now . " Geiger said he had to report to his own office . He was terribly busy , he said . BERTHA PINCUS knew everything that had to be done . Suddenly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell other people what to do instead of having other people tell her what to do . She got hold of Ida Feingold and took her out  | of that death-filled room . She made Ida Feingold come downstairs to her flat . " You sit here , " she said . Then she got busy preparing food . " That 's for Oscar when he comes home to lunch , " she said . " We 'll bring him in here . " When the first carful of policemen came in answer to Mrs. Smiley 's call , she went out into the hall to talk to them , kept them from bothering Ida Feingold too much . All the time their heavy feet went up and down the stairs she listened for the steps of the kid , Oscar . She did n't bother about her sister . It was as if Mrs. Feldscher were not there at all . Celia Feldscher had taken off her wrapper and tied it in a newspaper . " You do n't need this any more , " she said to Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Huh ? " said Mrs. Pincus . " Oh . You going ? So long . " A policeman stopped Mrs. Feldscher at the door . " I have to be home ! " she declared . " I am only here on a visit to my sister . You have no right to detain me . My boy has to have his music lesson this morning ! " " That 's all right , sister , but you better wait till we find out something about this , " the policeman said . He backed her into her sister 's house .  | Celia Feldscher sat on a chair , silent , sputtering , but saying not a word either to Mrs. Pincus or to Ida Feingold . They had wronged her , she felt . IDA listened to the many feet on the stairs . Not for Oscar 's light step , she listened . Now , more than ever , a certainty had come into her heart . Her husband would come home to-day . He would know , he would feel that something had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had liked Red . They used to rough-house together . It could n't be right that the two of them should be taken from her . It was not fair . One would have to return . She waited . The heavy steps that passed the door were not his steps . His feet were dancing feet , he was a flashy guy . She would know the sound of him on the stairs . She waited . There was a bubbling eagerness within her as she sat on the edge of the chair , waiting , ready to spring to the door and meet him on the stairs . And all the time words went over and over in her mind . " How terrible ! how terrible ! I 'm not sorry Red is dead . I 've forgotten Red is dead . I 'm glad that Red is dead because it might bring Julius back to me . How terrible . I 'm glad that Red is dead ! "  | MRS . PINCUS stopped Oscar on the stairway . " Come in here , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wondering he came into her place , where she had already set upon the table every sort of food that he might like . Marinated herring she had ready , with black bread , and hard cookies that were peppered with poppy-seeds ; she had a small piece of fried steak for him , too , and coffee almost white with milk . His mother did not say anything to him when Mrs. Pincus brought him into the room , she did not even act as if she saw him . It was all as if Mrs. Pincus had become his mother , the way she acted , too , as if she owned him . He did not want to eat there . All the good things on the table made him feel awfully afraid and hurt . But he sat down on the chair Mrs. Pincus held ready for him . It was as though he were walking a high fence ; he did not dare place his feet anywhere but on the narrow board , or he would fall , fall . He sat eating , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to go in our house , " he murmured . " Nothing is the matter . Everything is fine . Eat , eat , " said Mrs. Pincus . Quickly she sat down  | opposite him and put a great chunk of black bread into her mouth . " See , I am eating , too , " she said . His great round eyes were fastened on his mother . " You eat ! " he said . After a moment she replied , " I ai n't hungry . " His great eyes never left her face . He watched her as closely as though she were a magician doing a card-trick . Suddenly he said , " Where 's Red ? " She hated him ! She knew , she knew all the time he was not like her child . He was too smart . He would cry . He was a cry-baby . That 's what he was . A cry-baby . " Where 's Red ? " he whined . " Why do n't he eat ? I wo n't eat unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ida burst out . " Red got killed ! " The little boy went sick , as if he had been eating the flesh of his brother . ALL day , all day policemen . Anna Joracek smiled to herself . It was a good thing that Joe had not waited . The policemen that came at first knew nothing . But the policemen that came afterward had been told . " Where is that gun ? " they said to her .  | She shrugged her shoulders . " Your policeman brought the pistol , " she said . " You ask him . " " Listen , lady , do you know you are liable to fine and imprisonment for keeping the policeman 's gun ? " The one that spoke so loud was the more important of the two men . " Come on , out with it ! " he said . " You admit you had the gun , do n't you ? " " Search , " she said , motioning to include all of her house . " Search . " The less important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him something on a slip of paper . " That 's right ! " the first one said . And turning on her , he demanded , " Where 's your husband ? " " Huh ? " she said . " There was a man , Joracek , here this morning , " he said , waving the slip of paper . " That 's your husband , ai n't it ? Well , where is he ? " " I du n no , " she said . His mouth tightened . " What 's he doing with that gun ? Listen , lady , you 're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble ? " At last she said , " He is gone out . " " Where ? " She was silent .  | " All right , " he said . " We 'll find him and put him in jail . Y ' ca n't get away with that stuff , swiping an officer 's gun and running loose . " He turned to his partner and said , " We better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to snivel . The second policeman murmured to his boss , " He musta gone out to hock the gat . They 're stone broke . " " Yeah ? " said the boss policeman . " More likely went out to do a stick-up . " Anna watched the men 's faces . She understood . " Listen , " she said hastily , with a pleading honesty in her voice . " I tell you . My husband he went to sell the gun . We have not a cent . He said he can sell it . " " Oh , is that so ? " The policeman looked with a twisted grin into her face , but she kept the pleading humble honesty strong in her eyes . The policeman looked over at Marie , where she sat huddled on a chair , small , and yet not altogether a child . He shrugged . " All right , " he said . And to his partner , " Better stick around till he gets back . " The policeman sat in the hallway , waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus he was the first to encounter the newspapermen . A skinny fellow , who , from the first moment , looked as if he was turning and going away , came together with a middle-aged cameraman ; almost immediately after them came a woman ; while Mr. Stratford was still standing in the vestibule with these three , there arrived a young-faced chap who had gray hair . " This way , please , " said Mr. Stratford . " I suppose your editor has sent you in response to my message . In his intense elation , it seemed to him that his letter must have gone swiftly as a telegram , because it was addressed to a newspaper office , and marked " Urgent . " " I have been expecting you , " he told them . " You may trust me to give you the complete and accurate facts . " " Where is the mother ? " said the woman . " Where 's the body ? " the photographer said . " This way , please . " He led them up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . " He motioned them to chairs around the large table . The thin young man seemed hesitant about entering . The woman sat down . He waited for the  | others to be seated . They stared at him . And then , with sudden quick movements , sat down . " My name is Herbert Stratford , " he said , and waited for them to write out his name . " Say ? " the thin fellow got up . " Just one moment , " said Mr. Stratford . " I am sure that your editor ? " Another reporter appeared at the door . " Is this the place ? " he said . And , seeing the others , came in and sat down . Mr. Stratford gleamed satisfaction upon them . " In 1907 , " he began , " I received this sword as a token of esteem from my fellow-members in the ? " " What 's the name of the boy that was shot ? " the new reporter asked . Mr. Stratford glared at him . The reporter turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recognition of my services , " Mr. Stratford began again , " for twenty years as a clerk in the employ of the Express company , from whom I have a recommendation signed by the district manager , personally . . . . " The skinny young man had arisen , was at the door . The others were exchanging uneasy glances . " This house has been the scene of a bold revolutionary plot ! " declared Mr. Stratford , desperately .  | " If not for the presence of one staunch and loyal veteran  --  " Again , he was interrupted . Mrs. Stratford had had only a half-day 's work cleaning a doctor 's office . She returned to the house now , coming up the stairs with her mop and brushes , intending to leave them with Mrs. Feingold . First she saw the policeman sitting on the stairs . Then she saw the blood-stain in the hallway . " Gott ! " she cried . Her husband ! Still holding the mop , the brushes , and her bundle of scrubbing clothes , she rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried as she came into the room . Mr. Stratford stared at her as at an intruding scrub-woman . Blood mounted to his face , to his ears . He choked down the rage in his voice . " You should make clear to your editors , " he tried to continue , coolly , to address the newspaper people , but the thin one was already out the door . The others had arisen . The woman stood there , facing him . Then she realized that she still held the brush and the bundle of clothes . Hastily , as if she were a cleaning-woman , she made a little apologizing movement and went into the kitchen .  | " Thank you very much , " the gray-haired man was saying . " But are you sure you have all the facts ? " Mr. Stratford hung over him . " Oh , yes . Oh , yes ? " he folded his notepaper . " But  --  " There was no keeping them . They were already trooping down the hallway . One of them knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room for an instant , holding his bitterness . Once more , she had ruined his career . ANNA JORACEK had answered all their questions . Her name . Her girl 's name . How long her husband was out of work . But the photographer would not go away . He wanted a picture of the family . The evicted family . " No , " she said . " No picture . " Marie sat silent in the corner . The photographer kept talking , talking . It would only take a minute , he said . Just her and the girl . Just for a favor to him . What harm would it do her ? And all the time he kept looking to Marie . " No , " Anna said . " Go away . "  | He smiled , he begged . She did not want it . That she knew . She did not want the picture in the paper , herself and Marie , beggars who were thrown on the street . " No ! " she said . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push him to the door . A little while afterward , Marie got up and went out . MORE people had come , photographers , reporters , policemen . They were all together now , more than a dozen of them in the hallway . " The body , " they said . Then some one opened the door to the Feingold flat . The naked body of the dead boy lay on the table . Behind the table stood a woman . Her arms were bare . She was washing the body . They saw the brownness of her arms and face , golden brown as richly moistened earth , bare and warm against the pale shrunken body of the boy . Not a clothed woman , she seemed , but an engulfing , living form . Her arms outstretched , they saw , the fingers reaching to close the wound in the poor flesh of the boy . They stopped in their coming into the room . Maria Dobrowsky lifted her eyes to them .  | " What do you want ? " she said . The woman among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want the mother . " Yet , though she knew at once that this was not the mother , she could not ask her question of one who seemed so completely , so more the mother of the flesh . " We wanted to see ? " they said , remaining at the door . Her eyes watched them , unangry , unpuzzled . " He is dead , " she said . " The boy . " She lifted her hands a small way from the body , to let them see , to show them how he was dead . Then she looked again down upon the body . Her eyes rested , calm , absorbed , upon the unclothed form . The man with the young face and the white hair said , " Excuse us , madam . " He closed the door . Maria Dobrowsky passed her smoothening hands over the hair of the dead boy . WHEN the newspaper people were out on the street they saw the little Joracek girl . " Hey ! " the photographer said . " Hello , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his camera .  | SWEET pussy ! what a skin she had ! When she rolled that belly button the same time she rolled her eyes ! You 'd go dizzy it was so cute ! So white , so baby lamb ! So slim in the waist , so soft there he could break her in two ! Jerry Marks tapped his toes , jerked his knees , as he waited for his number . Four days , five days now she had him waiting in the fire . He twitched and he itched , he could n't sit still . He could n't stop singing and he could n't sing a whole song through . Everything went snatch , snatch inside of him . " You 're my summer , winter , spring ! baby ! " All day long his mother had been hanging around the phone calling the old man at the office . Christ , what if the kid had tried to buzz him and the line had been busy ? She 'd never try twice . Boy , when she heard that new baby-talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that music talk ! How he could make the **44;324;TOOLONG talk ! Oh , could she roll the whites of her eyes , roll her  | little white belly button to that song ! Boy ! could the two of them make an act ! Would that knock the whole world gaa-gaa ! And then she would come through all right . He could feel it , feel it now ! Just as soon as she got the idea he was right in her own crowd , no Park Avenue swell , but a kid that could do mean things on that mouth-organ , a kid that could pull an act with her and would they go big ! He could see it , feel it now ! After their first big success , they 'd pile into a cab and burn up the town ! He 'd get her lit ? boy how she could get lit ! Then he 'd show her how he did that little trick with the harmonica . " Cmere , baby , cmere ! " Pretend her mouth was the mouth-organ . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boy , they 'd finish that in bed ! " No , Mr. Simon Marks is not here ! " he yelled , exasperated . " I 'm trying to get a number . Get off the line , willya ! " He heard her telephone ringing . She 'd reach for it out of her bed ! " What ? What ? " They were still on the wire . The old man 's office . " Huh ? All right , make it snappy , what is it ? Yah , an eviction . The police shot a kid . Well , what the hell could he do about it ? All right , I 'll tell him , good-by . " He jiggled the hook . Would he never get that number ? When you hear that waa-waa  --   | This time she answered the phone ! " Say , cheater , where yuh been all day ! Asleep ? Yah , in whose bed ? Well then , why didn'tcha answer ? I phoned a million times . Well , listen , I got a stunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuh ! " She had him nuts . She had him so he could n't hold the phone ! " Yah ! Yah ! I 'll be up early . Say , maybe we 'll try it out to-night , huh ? " Just then he felt his mother there , hanging around the hallway . What did she want around the phone all day ? Could n't she let a fellow  - -  He quickly finished the conversation . " Like father , like son , " she said , in her hard tragic voice . What did she have against the old man now ? " When your father comes home , " she announced , " if he maybe thinks of coming home to his family to-night , you get him to write that letter for you to take to Mr. Rosenblatt , you understand ? Mr. Rosenblatt is a good friend of the governor , and his wife promised me he would do for you like for his own son ! Even Clifford Ogden could not get more than he should be secretary to the consul in Smyrna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " But  --  " he said . " What ? " He was silent .  | " You think it is easy for me ? You think it is easy for a mother to have her son go to the other end of the world ? But do you realize what it means ? The most distinguished , the highest kind of profession in the world . A diplomat ! A lot of help I get ! All day a man ca n't even be in his office ! All right , let him run around , let him have fifty women , to me it does not matter any more , but at least he can help out a little when I have moved mountains for the career of his son . At least  --  " Jerry Marks got up and walked away .  | BOY KILLED AS TENANTS FIGHTING EVICTION BATTLE POLICE TRAGEDY stalked in the corridor of the new tenement at 312 Spring street in Marks Gardens to-day as Harry Feingold , 14 , was killed by a police bullet when he joined a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Joracek from the premises . The Joracek family owed three months ' rent . Joe Joracek , a building worker , had been unable to obtain employment for eight months . At nine A.M. Jerry Geiger , assistant marshal , arrived to effect the eviction . He was confronted by a massed array of tenants armed with brooms , bats , and all manner of household weapons . The neighbors , Mr. Geiger asserted , had been incited by a communist agitator . Geiger was accompanied by patrolman Al Mullins and by an assistant named Young Harris . The three men were attacked by the neighbors . In the ensuing battle , the policeman was forced to draw his gun and fire . The Feingold boy , who had been in the thick of the fray , was killed . Later the infuriated tenants captured and imprisoned the marshal , the policeman , and their assistant , threatening them with death . Mr. Geiger however was able to calm the attackers and win the release of the three men .  | THERE were pictures of Marie Joracek in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other story about Ida Feingold beating the racketeers ; he printed the old picture of her at the newsstand , with a feature story headed " Amazon 's Cub Slain ! "  | JOE JORACEK was in a subway . A long , long time the train had been going in that dark tunnel . The sound was like churning , churning rocks in a cement mixer . A hole opened . Something poured out . Something poured in . The mixer rocked . The pouring and the rocking was all one long flowing curling churn of time , was all in the length of the tunnel ; a hole , a rocking blackness . Not people coming in and going out , but sacks , dumped in , wheeled away . Inside of his head was a heavy stone . He could not think . He needed to lift away the stone ; he needed to think . It was like once when he held a puzzle in his hands . A tricky little key puzzle that Marie had brought him out of the ten-cent store . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Take them apart , " Marie said , laughing . That had happened outside of the house . He was coming home from work , and Marie was outside with the other children , with the red-faced boy from next door ; they had all been playing with  | that puzzle , and the minute she saw him coming Marie ran to him and said , " Take it apart . " He stopped and set his lunch-box on the steps . Then he took the puzzle in his thick fingers . His fingers were so used to holding large heavy things that it was even difficult for him to get hold of the two loops separately , they kept being both in the same hand . But at last he held one loop in each hand , delicately , like holding open the wings of a butterfly . Thus he inspected the puzzle . Oh , they were cunning small tricks to fool a man . For it was plain that the little mouth between the ends of each loop was purposely made just too small for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along one wire there must be a flattened spot that was not easily seen , but that could easily be passed through the little open mouth , if the thing was properly twisted around . Marie hung over his arm watching , laughing , while he turned the loops in and out , up and down , clumsily tangling his fingers , until the other children all laughed , and his forehead was covered with sweat . " Damn it ! " he said , " I show you ! " He gave a quick yank that separated the two keys . He held them apart from each other , one in each hand , and was pleased .  | But Marie had stopped laughing . " No fair ! No fair ! " she said . " You forced it ! You forced it ! No fair ! " Then the boy Red took the things out of his fingers and said , " Here , I 'll show you ! " But Joe had picked up his lunch-box and gone into the house . It was as if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers were sweaty with dirt , and his eyes were dizzy from trying to find the trick opening . He shook his head , to shake off the confusion of the puzzle . He blinked his eyes , and looked away from his hands . On the wall , high in the car , were signs for cough medicines . One after another , cough medicines and yellow teeth . That was all . Twenty cards , every one for a cough medicine or yellow teeth . Pictures of people in the snow , clutching at their throats , their mouths open , as if they were choking from a cough . Pictures of girls , crying because they had yellow teeth , and then suddenly smiling with white teeth . His eyes went down the dirty whiteness of the car walls , white like in the waiting room of a free hospital . Then he saw the faces on the seats opposite him . The faces too were like faces of people sitting waiting , where , anywhere , everywhere , they  | were sitting waiting . In a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free soup kitchen , they were sitting like this and waiting . There was no hurry for him . He was sitting and waiting . Anna had told him to wait until the night . All day he had waited . For a long time he had been on the bridge , waiting . He had sat there on a bench , looking far away and down at the gray water , looking far up into the gray girders . Like forever , he sat there . Then it was night . It was easier to do this because Anna had told him to do it . So many times in his life he had done a thing because Anna had told him to do it , and long afterward it had come to his own mind to do that thing , but then he would remember that he had already done it at Anna 's word . On the seat opposite him was a blonde woman , a bleached blonde as they were called , other women were scornful of them because they washed their hair in acid to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it was a sign to the men that it was all right to approach her , she was opening herself to men . Many times , before Anna , he had gone to places where there were women . But that cost a lot , and the men said when you had a wife yourself it was better , you had her all the time and it did n't cost you anything . But that  | was not the true reason for Anna . All these last months , if he had had a couple of dollars , there were nights when he might have gone back to one of those women , away from Anna . Why ? Not because of fault in Anna . A little Jew sat near the blonde woman but did not know she was there . He was so worried , his skin was all wrinkled leather . He had big hands , twisted like vines , gripped as if they had grown around his knees . Three young fellows were standing up though there was plenty of room to sit down , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they kept shoving each other around , kicking each other and looking away to pretend another one had given the kick ; at last one of the boys , he had dark marks all over his face , gave a smaller blond fellow one heavy shove that swung him with the sway of the car tumbling upon the seat against the blonde woman . The young fellow jumped up as though he had sat on coals . Joe Joracek put his hand in his overcoat pocket . A boy came through the car selling newspapers . " News , Mirror , News , Mirror . " He was skinny , had a red face , red hair , and scattered teeth . " News , Mirror , News , Mirror . " Joe carefully watched him go all the way through the car . Joe  | never saw what was in the papers . Somewhere in the middle , compressed in the thick fold of the sheets . Boy Killed in Tenement Battle . The story of the brave marshal , Jerry Geiger , and the brave policeman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negress sitting at the far end of the car . She looked old , perhaps she was thirty . Her feet sprawled in broken slippers of peeling cardboard , her stockings were black cotton . She wore some sort of coat of rubbed-off plush ; her hands were folded in her lap , and her face seemed utterly without life . Sometime Anna would be an old woman . A man on a crutch came into the car , went carefully and silently from one passenger to the next , putting envelopes of assorted needles on the knees of each person sitting there ; up one aisle and down the next he went , then started back the way he had come , from one passenger to the next , without a word , picking up the envelopes he had placed on their knees . When the car lurched the man held onto one of the poles , leaning at the same time on his crutch . He had been in the war . Joracek did not pick up the needles that lay on his knee ; at last the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not look at him . All the people in the car had been sitting as  | if that man were not there , had not touched them , had not passed . Sometimes a pair of eyes followed him as he picked up his needles and jerked himself to the next person . In the whole car he got not a nickel . He pulled open the door , bracing his crutch against the opening , and so made his way into the next car . But right after him there came a boy with packages of chewing gum . The boy was very young . This late at night young children should be asleep . The boy did not look sleepy . He was not smiling either . He walked along , putting a package of chewing gum on the knee of each person . Then he started back , picking up his packages of chewing gum . He went very fast as if he were racing to overtake and pass the cripple with the needles . To Joe now it was like a whole procession of people putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Far in the center of himself it was if he were sitting in a prison , with his arms chained to his sides , and people came and put things on his lap . A golden brick , they put there , and let him look at it for a long while ; then they took it away . They brought a platter of beautiful food and placed it on his knees : roast chicken with baked potatoes , and fresh peasant bread , and  | new corn . That , too , they took away . Then there was something they had brought him that was neither gold nor food . Then , even while he was sitting in a small stone prison , it was as if he were sitting on a fence looking out over a green field , where not far away a brook flowed , and there were pear trees . He was resting , behind him was the framework of the house that he was building . Anna came toward him with his food . She was beautiful and warm-looking in the sun as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wife of Stanley Dobrowsky . She brought him his food and was going to sit with him . Then that too was taken away . Instead of it all , the gun lay there . His hand was on the gun now , within his pocket his hand held the gun . The subway car had stopped and he was through its doors . Now he was among a maze of square white pillars . He felt that he was caught here . Inside his breast there was a feeling like the grinding of hot ungreased wheels that would soon crash and explode . He must push , he must push with his arms against the walls to be up out of here , to reach the air of the street . It was a light over a stairway that brought him out . An endless stairway , three times up it went ,  | each time turning into more corridors of shiny white bricks . But at last he stood in the night , in the street ; it felt like being washed after a long day of sweating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather have had a cup of coffee and an egg sandwich in a Coffee Pot somewhere than come home for supper . But if he did not come home to eat , Minnie would be even worse . She would go around looking as if the next minute she would take poison . As if everything he did , he thought of doing only because it would make her feel bad . So it was : for the last three days she would not talk to him even . She made it a sickness for him to be in the house . But if on account of the way she acted he stayed away from the house to breathe a little peace , she would only make it seem that he was staying away to torture her more . She wanted him to pay the rent . She was ashamed to look the doorman in the face when she went out of the building . She was sure the doorman knew that Mr. Marks had not paid the rent for his apartment . She was sure she saw a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he opened the door for her . She was a prisoner  | in her own house because she could not face the doorman . " Minnie , " he had explained a hundred times to her , " I have n't got any money , I have n't got a cent . I 'm poor . " But she never listened to such explanations . All her life when she wanted something he had told her he did n't have any money , she claimed , but all the same when he needed money to buy a new building he found plenty ! That was the way she looked at him as if to say , " You still have property , you still have a whole city of property , you are worth millions ! " How could he explain to her ... . Maybe when he came home to-night he would take out the two five-dollar bills he had got in the bank and give them to her saying , " That 's the last cent I have in the world . " Would she understand then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had telling him to turn over his property to the receiver ? Would she understand then that the houses were no use to him , that half the flats were empty , that you could n't make them pay their rent , those people ? Maybe if she would understand , if she would soften a little , then the two of them could sit down and talk together once more , like in the old days when they sat together in the room behind the  | store and figured out what to do . Sensible , she had been , good and sensible , never then had he felt alone in the world . But how could he talk to her , be friendly with her , make her understand even that he needed her just to be somebody near him , when the minute he came near her these days she was filled with a poison of suspicion , and if he tried to be nice to her she took it at once as a clew that he was easing his conscience for having betrayed her with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am an old woman ! " she would cry . " Go , go , get yourself a young woman . I am used up . You and your son and your daughter have used me up . " He would say to her to-night , " I am an old man , too . " Perhaps that would quiet her fears . " Let us live peacefully , " he would say . " The children are grown up . What do we have to fight for any more , why do we have to tear our hearts ? " Then perhaps they would sit down to discuss what should be done with the business . A good adviser she had been in the younger days , shrewd , understanding every little twist and turn of credits and loans and interest rates , and always finding little schemes how he could use his money for two things at one time , always making him go bigger ,  | higher in the world . But now she would be on the other side . Even Marks Gardens she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawling for across the river ? Do you want to own the whole United States ? You have enough , Simon . Keep what you have , it is clear property , it is yours , you can retire and better we should spend our time making something of the children . " So she would say now , " Sell the property , no matter how little is left , it will be enough for us to live on . When the children are married we will retire into some little corner to live out our days . " Sell it ! Now ! If he could make her understand ! Understand , Minnie , I 've got to hang on , overnight I 've got to find some way to hang on until times are a little better . Maybe Rosenblatt will help me pull through ... . No . It would be no use to talk to her . SO they sat eating dinner . " Tell your father , " Minnie said to their daughter , " what happened at the clinic to-day . " He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl who was in the room that Minnie wanted something said . Something to show off , it must be . " Oh , it was just a silly mistake , " said Beatrice .  | " Of course I have no right to the degree for a couple of months yet . But you see I was taking down some case histories , when the new psychiatrist came into the office , and Dr. Walters introduced me to him as Doctor Marks . So now all the clients around the place keep calling me Doctor Marks . " All the same , Simon Marks could see that the girl was proudly glad of this , and it did not make him so happy . " It sounds funny but you get used to it , " she said . " I really have n't the right to it for a couple of months , yet . " " What 's he like , the new psychiatrist ? " said Mrs. Marks , her eyes gleaming . " Oh , " said Beatrice , with the small drawl that came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sort of affected and rather stupid . " Mrs. Marks cut angrily at her steak . " Pass the sugar , will you , Dr. Marks , " said Jerry elaborately . She made it seem as if it was only to torture her that Beatrice refused to fall in love with the new psychiatrist . Especially to torture her , the boy ran after night club girls . And for no other reason than to torture her , her husband did not pay the rent . How could he come to her now and show her the lawyer 's letter and say , " What shall we do ? "  | After supper he went silently into the other room . He went to the desk that was made of hand-carved wood . In his desk was a drawer with a combination lock . There he kept valuable papers . He opened the drawer and took out the deed to Marks Gardens . That was the whole thing , Marks Gardens , in that folded oblong of paper . Now he placed it on the desk , near his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then more strongly than ever the strange resistance came upon him . At the same moment that he felt he was in desperation for help , that he must write to Rosenblatt , he felt almost with laughter that he would not write at all ! It was not that he was too proud to ask for help . Surely it could be put on the basis of business . But some unreal floating feeling came like a veil over his mind , something like feeling that the whole thing was in a dream . There , across the river , he had built houses . With one piece of paper he gave them away . With another piece of paper on which he wrote to Rosenblatt he still held them . But the houses were all the time there , steel , brick , wood , concrete . How was it ? And was it true that if he did not put his hand to this white piece of paper , the houses would vanish ? A crazy lust had taken hold of him , like when a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time under water . Can it be that in one second less he is alive , and one second more he is dead ? But that special deciding second of time , is it not like every other second of time that passes ? He would not write the letter . He would not write the letter , and see what would happen ! Nevertheless he held the pen in his hand . He could feel Minnie 's heavy anger like a pile of dishes hanging unbalanced on a shelf , any minute it would fall . And he could not write a word on the paper , for he was really listening for that crash of her anger . He sat spellbound , waiting . Suddenly she was in the room . " Stop him ! " she cried . An agony was in her voice , that she should have to come to him for help . " What , Minnie ? " he asked . " God in heaven ! I 'll die of shame ! And you sit there ! Stop him ! A fine son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club ! " Jerry stood behind her , his mud plaster of a face trying to make a show of concern for his mother , while all the time it held a grin of triumphant delight . In his hands he carried his fancy silver-plated mouth-organ . A wet smack , that 's what he was , this boy .  | " Jeez , what 'll it hurt ? " he said . " I just got a call . It 's a swell chance . If I make good to-night they take us on  --  me on as a regular specialty . Listen , if I ca n't make this thing talk ! " He puckered his mouth and tongued into the instrument , Cha-da chaa-da chaaa  - -  Minnie had a heart  --  " Stop it ! Stop it ! " screamed Minnie Marks . The boy took the harmonica from his mouth , and looked blankly at his mother . He could not understand why any one should n't like those sounds . " You 're not going , do you hear ! " she said . " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't got anybody else . " " Who cares ! Let them pick up an organ grinder on the street  --  " " Say  --  " In a night club ! You 'll ruin your career ! " she cried . " Say , I can make my career to-night ! " White-faced , Mrs. Marks stared at her son . Then Beatrice had to come in . " Let him go , mother , " she said precisely . " It 's probably what he 's best fitted for . Every one should be allowed to do what they want to do . " Mrs. Marks whirled on her . " Who asked you !  | Our fine doctor ! Our psychologist ! That 's the best you understand , to tell your brother to ruin his life ! " She towered over her husband . " You sit there ! If you are asked even to write one little letter , to get him into a decent career , you sit there and let him go to hell ! Did n't I work myself to the bone he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take insults and shut my eyes and swallow all kinds of snobbish poison so he should get a chance to be taken into the diplomatic sewice ? How much dirt I stood from that Mrs. Ogden just to get you introductions . I get you a chance to get into the highest profession in the world , where people are gentlemen , where you would be treated everywhere with respect . Mrs. Ogden told me for her own son she could not get a better job than he should be assistant consul this year , and you want to be a harmonica player . All right ! Ruin your life ! " " Well , all right , mother , it 's his own life ! " said Beatrice . " You shut up ! " Minnie cried . " Why God should punish me like this I do n't know . I always was a good wife and a mother . My whole life I laid down for you .

All right . No one is good enough for you . All right . Be an old maid . That 's the reward I get . In my old age my husband can go and get himself a new young wife , I am no more use to him  --  " " Shut up , mother ! " said Beatrice . Telling her to shut up ! And he , her husband , sat there silent . Sat there and let his children walk all over her . " Good . I 'll shut life . Twenty years from now you will remember what I said to you . A life , without a husband , without children  --   --  " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so coldly and understandingly at her mother . Mrs. Marks felt doubly angered , and yet weakened . " Go on , laugh at me ! All of you ! Make fun of me ! A raving old woman , huh ? My husband , my children , a fine reward for my life ! I slave my best years away to make a good home for you , and now look , I have to stay a prisoner in the house because the  | great Mr. Marks , the millionaire , ca n't even pay the rent for his apartment . I have to hide my face from the elevator man and the doorman . I have to listen to the maids whispering  --  " Beatrice said , " Is it father 's fault that things have turned out so badly ? I am sure there are plenty of other families on Park Avenue  --  - " " It is n't his fault ? Then whose fault is it ? Maybe my fault ? He has n't got the money ! All my life that 's what I have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pawnbroker with my life 's blood . Every time I wanted a dress for you , I had to tear it from him with my flesh . For myself I do not even speak . I would go in rags , barefoot , rather than ask him for a nickel . I would live in a basement . But for my daughter I wanted good clothes , a nice home , so she could stand a chance to marry a fine man  --  he has n't got the money . Twelve blocks of houses he owns , and he has n't got money to pay the rent so the elevator man wo n't laugh if my daughter brings a young man up to the house  --  " Beatrice said to her father , " Ca n't you do anything about the rent ? " " No , " he said , shrugging his shoulders . " Well , if all this elegance is for the sake of your daughter 's young men , " she said , " you might as  | well give it up . You 're an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marks had to hold his breath , then , for these words of his daughter cut into him . How she stood there , straight , this Dr. Marks , and hard . Like an old maid already , he thought , though often when he came into a dim-lighted room where she was reading he saw her looking sweet and round-faced like a young girl that a man might well want . But other times , like now , hard surfaces came on her face , while her whole body seemed to freeze tight : an old maid giving a lecture , a Dr. Marks , she was . She would analyze them all like one of her precious cases . Well , maybe he was a case , a charity case pretty soon . " As far as I am concerned , " the young woman continued , " there is no need for any fake elegance . You 'll have to drop that excuse , mother . I think if the family is broke and all we have left are those tenements out there , and since so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good time for us to go and live there . We would n't have to worry about the rent , and I am quite sure I should not feel ashamed to invite young men to see me there . They are rather nice little apartments . Model tenements , are n't they ? Designed for small families just like ours . Modern , with every convenience , and suited to a modest income . With  | my salary at the clinic , and Jerry 's income as a harmonica player  - -  Mrs . Marks had collapsed into a chair and was weeping . The boy stood there as if holding himself by sheer will on a bed of nails . Then , of all the crazy things , he drifted over and turned on the radio . Minnie had a heart  --  " For God 's sake ! " cried Beatrice , " shut that damn thing off ! " She strode across the room and turned the knob . But Mrs. Marks had already rushed toward her bedroom , just as if she were going to take poison . Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew she would not take poison . Then , even if she would ... . He pushed that terrible thought from himself . He knew that if he believed for a second she might do it he would stop her . This was not her fault . She had had a hard life . The boy picked up his fancy instrument , hung around a moment . " Say , I forgot to tell you , " he said . " Your office called . Something about an eviction in the tenements . The police killed some one . " " What ? " said Simon Marks . " Police ? Who ? " " That 's all I know , " said the boy . He pocketed  | his harmonica . " Hell , I 'll be late , " and he went out . Simon Marks was alone with his daughter . " Killed . Police . " The words flashed off and on in his mind , but only as startling lights against a vast , a heavy wall , against all that had been going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , he dared lift his eyes . There was even a small hope far inside him , as if a test he had long awaited was now to take place . Maybe they two could say something to each other , be some use to each other . She held very still under his look ; he hoped one instant that her lip was trembling . " Oh , what 's the use , " she said . " I 'd better go look after mother . " SO Simon Marks found himself alone in the room . Before him still lay that sheet of paper upon which his plea to Rosenblatt , his last hope for the salvation of his fortune , was to be inscribed . " Killed . Police . " The words seemed to flash on and off the paper . But what could he do ? Did the place even belong to him ? " Way back in my family , " he liked to think , " the men were all scholars and philosophers , learned rabbis . Maybe I am a little like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing in this world , running around , buying houses , building houses , has only been because I was scared of myself and in a hurry to build a wall before my thoughts , so that the thoughts would not take hold of me . Maybe the whole world is not so real to me as my thoughts , my feelings . Maybe if I had led another life , studying , thinking .... And again the dizziness came over him , the dizziness through which he tried to grasp all of his possessions , all those rows of houses , to feel them on his hand heavier than a piece of paper , heavier than the ink of a signature , heavier than the thought in his mind . Through this confused dizziness , he heard , as if he remembered hearing , a name . What ? He listened . A strange voice was speaking in the room . The radio had not been silenced . Beatrice had mistakenly turned the knob so that it almost reached another station ; the sounds could not be very clearly heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . ... well known financier and philanthropist . . . News of the suicide was withheld until after the closing of the market .... " This too was not real . He could make four steps , turn the knob with his fingers , and there would be no more sounds . Then surely it would  | be as if the thing had never happened . The voice went on , " Mr. Rosenblatt is survived by  --  " Simon Marks sat still , hearing over and over the words that had been in the air . They were even less real than words written on paper . Words spoken from a mouth could be seen . Words written on paper could be touched . But this that was nowhere ... . " . . . the suicide of Mr. Rosenblatt .... " He looked about the room , as if to make sure that no one stood there and spoke , to make sure that the thing was unreal , untrue . Then he saw the maid who had been standing in the doorway trying to get his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking , and yet her words were less real than the words that came so indistinctly from behind a small piece of wood . " ... he insists on seeing you , " the girl said . Marks nodded his head , blankly , not understanding her , knowing merely that the nod would make her leave the room . The girl went out , and left Joracek standing in the doorway . Simon Marks sat with his back to that doorway , staring at the radio that had spoken the news of Rosenblatt 's death . He stared at the machine as if he would ask a great many questions about  | stocks , assets , dividends , reports , and yet as if he knew the answers all by heart . Joracek saw only the back of the head , the baldish head of the man who must be Simon Marks . Joracek raised the gun , feeling still the command of Anna within him . But his thick clumsy finger would not bend to press the trigger . There , for some seconds , he stood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and died a terror that was exactly like the terror he sometimes felt at night when he feared that Anna would reach out her hand for him ; when he lay filled with heavy desire for her , and yet held himself from taking her , and all the time feared that she would reach out her hand for him and that in that moment the strength would go shamefully down into his blood . So now it happened . In this terrible instant , the strength went down within him . He could not shoot . Simon Marks became aware of the man in the doorway only after he had been looking at him , at the pointed gun , for several seconds . Then all at once he had a full , exact knowledge of the man standing there with the pistol pointed toward him , but the man had already whirled and vanished . " What ? " said Simon Marks . " What , what ? "  | This too seemed a diseased vision , questionable as the voice over the radio . But no , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He rose from the chair . In his head , there was a whirring from side to side , like an electric fan turning on a pivot . Rosenblatt had killed himself and some one had wanted to kill him . Some one had been killed and he had been killed . The rents were unpaid and his rent was unpaid . The paper was his and the houses were theirs , the houses and the paper ... . Minnie had a heart  - -  Then , knowing only one blind necessity to get out of that place , he had quickly stuffed the folded document into his breast pocket , put on his derby hat and his velvet-collar coat , and walked .  | THAT night in the middle of the night the air was cold and loose , drifting in rare chill strands over the crust of the earth . The bridge was a street that suddenly left the city by launching itself into the black empty sky . It gave no seeming of return to another shore . Mr. Simon Marks walked fast onto the bridge way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other could be felt . There , the black zigzag irons stuck up around him like so many clubs over a mouse . Off the bridge , below , and all about him everything was black ; the bridge under his feet seemed no more solid than a black line drawn on black paper ; or else the whole thing was solid : the bridge , and out there the night , and below the water : it was all a solid blackness . Some one had tried to kill him . Mr. Simon Marks walked very fast ; his movements seemed erratic like those of a pendulum set at a crazy pace . With each step it seemed that he must fall over his feet or start running ; he saved  | his balance only by jerking out another step , lurching forward like a competitor in a fast-walking race who wants to cheat and run but who is held by the rule of touching heels first to the ground . Then , as when a hand is put to the pendulum , Mr. Marks was stopped short . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fleshly than the chill strands of night air that seemed to weave through the jungle of his brain , had touched the very center of his senses , touched a button that called the whole mechanism to an emergency stop : touched the thought : some one had tried to kill him ! For a long moment he was held frozen still . Then , as when the hand is watchfully withdrawn , leaving the pendulum shivering with the habit of momentum , he felt a straining dizziness there in his brain , a confusion of other thoughts seething under the thought that some one had been killed , some one had tried to kill him ; and his body , as if charged by the new struggling thoughts , began to quiver and weave into motion . He pulled himself over to the bridge railing , and with his two hands flat on the railing and his body rubbing against it , he continued to drag forward , lagging ever slower , until at last , the ferment  | in his brain boiled down to decision , he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small man of that average insignificant stature which at times when many men are gathered together , as at political conventions or baseball games , seems by its very conformity in littleness to achieve a rightness suggesting grandeur . He was that sort of insignificant man who comes walking around with ten or twelve others , all of them wearing derby hats and velvet-collar coats , to launch a great battleship that men have built . They , the designers , engineers , executives , walk around under the cliff-like shelter of its hull as it waits upon the slideways , pointing their little sticks up at its vast spreading hulk . Once he had led men across the six-foot cement courtyards between the newly built houses , he had led them up one row and down the other , and everywhere he had tapped his stick against the cement of the sidewalk , against the brick of the walls , against the iron of the stairways , against the wood of the doors , the glass of the windows , the porcelain of the bath-tubs , and always the solidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact to him , though always he had felt as if a little surprised at the solidity that resisted the tapping of his arm , for had not that very
