In the Margin LET 'S GET THIS STRAIGHT , BEFORE WE START : All dentists have bad teeth , all barbers need haircuts , and all wars are fought in the name of peace . NEW THINGS REPEATING THEMSELVES : Times of crisis are times when a new act of dissociation is necessary . Then , it was dissociation of church and state . Now , it is dissociation of business and production . SOCIAL ARITHMETIC : PROGRESS OF THE EYE : From nature , to landscape , to real estate . PROVERB NO . I : Corruptio optimi pessima ? The corruption of the best is the worst . Show me a gentle person , and I 'll show you the one who , when balked or warped , will do the most thorough job of brutality . Show me a man trained in clarity , and I 'll show you the one who , when once he has decided to sell out , is admirably equipped to spread confusion . pacification appeasement . You " pacify " a weak country , and " appease " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FELL WHEN MEETING HITLER AT MUNICH ? We 'd like to know , because of what Freud says about such symbolic falls ( Freud , on that score , also finds justice in the superstition of the Romans , who would not carry out a plan of battle if they stumbled before beginning ) . And we watch the saga of the umbrella with engrossment . " In private conversation with friends recently , Chamberlain jokingly indicated his present frame of mind by telling the story of an old lady with an umbrella who , pursued by a lion , suddenly turned , opened her umbrella and frightened the lion , which turned tail . Chamberlain concluded his story smilingly : ' And I am taking my umbrella to Rome . " But it turns out that this was not the conclusion of the " old lady 's " story at all . The conclusion came , some days later , with the news that Chamberlain , on his visit to Mussolini , left without his umbrella . He had forgotten his one weapon , frail as it was for frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush from book to book like jitterbugs rushing from nightclub to nightclub . The resulting attempt to meet this demand is better for the book trade than for literature . I grant that production and distribution of books , like production and distribution of motor cars or magazines , ca n't be maintained without relying heavily upon " obsolescence . " Still , could n't this divine dispensation of finance be got in a less drastic way ? Why not , instead of reliance upon obsolescence in the book 's contents , get the same result by an improved manufacturing process ? Why not have books so constructed that you could n't read page two without tearing out page one ? PREEN AND PRONE : Preen may say to himself , " Prone is flattering me , " and be right . But he 'll accept the flattery as truth none the less . Why ? Because : To flatter a man is itself a flattery . Call a prominent fool a genius ? and you pay honest tribute to his prominence . DOING TWO THINGS AT ONCE : A wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fox hunt are acting symbolically . They are taking on social insignia , in such ways as Veblen makes clear in his " Theory of the Leisure Class . " Similarly , in warfare , a symbolic ingredient enters , in proportion to the indirectness that goes with the development of invention . As for bombs and gas capsules released from airplanes , what kind of weapon might that be ? Do we here get cows that fly , and that conquer by their sheer droppings ? What else would explain the particular kind of exaltation behind the Italian Futurists ' cult of war , and the quality of " heroism " in young Mussolini , expressing himself in his plane over Ethiopia ? FOOLING THE SQUIRREL : Once I fooled a squirrel . I deceived him completely . It was in the city of Columbus , Ohio . I was a student at the university , where there are squirrels on the campus . I passed a squirrel clinging upside down on a tree trunk , and held out my hand to him , as though I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I realized that I had to make the deception more realistic . So I grasped the tip of my middle finger between my forefinger and thumb , and held this tip out to him . Thus , it looked as if I really were offering some morsel to the stupid squirrel . My ruse worked perfectly . The imbecile promptly came forWard ? and in the belief that the tip of my finger was something for him to eat , he snatched at it , and bit clean to the bone .
