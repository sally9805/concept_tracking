An Ashram ( retreat ) in Lucknow , India is the spiritual home , and sometimes the physical home , of the world 's greatest Christian missionary-Dr . Eli Stanley Jones , Methodist , author of The Christ of the Indian Road , evangelist to high-caste Hindus , who call him Rishi ( a saint ) . From his Ashram last summer Dr. Jones wrote his friends about the Kingdom of God , declaring : " Never have I been so convinced that this is the one hope of the human race . How my heart tingles with joy that we have such a message for such a time as this . " Missionary Jones then left India , bound for the U. S. where , for two months during the autumn , he toured the country as chief speaker in a University Christian Mission of the Federal Council of Churches . <P> The Christian Mission , most vigorous evangelistic onslaught on college youth in a generation , brought Dr. Jones and his dynamic , intensely personal message to a dozen State universities . Last week , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thence he will make a four-day airplane dash to Madras , where this month meets an international missionary conference of high import . <P> The University Mission , staffed by speakers who are all able if not all of Dr. Jones 's high calibre , continues through the winter at 15 more colleges . Altogether , the Mission 's sponsors hope to reach 130,000 students . Results to date , while they have not included a general increase in churchgoing in the colleges , have borne out what the missioners felt at the beginning of their tour-that " American students are in a mood of vague wistfulness and are open to a vital presentation of the Christian message . . . .
