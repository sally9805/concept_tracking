President Roosevelt last week sent a chit to remind his Congress that one of his New Deal projects would be ready to begin functioning before the end of this year . That was the $45,000,000 Bonneville dam on the Columbia River 30 miles above Portland . He sent a report saying : " Incidental to its major purpose of improving navigation , the project will produce electric energy which will be used in the operation of the dam , locks and fish-ways , and surplus power will be available for distribution to the public . " He urgently advised Congress to pass a bill providing for Bonneville 's administration . <P> Bonneville dam is really not one dam but two , situated catercorner to each other on opposite sides of Bradford Island which lies in midstream . It has a single-lift lock which will raise vessels 66 ft. , higher than any other single lock in the world . Since it is the only dam in the U. S. ( except abandoned ' Quoddy on the opposite side of the U. S. ) situated on tidewater , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to go 50 miles farther up the Columbia to The Dalles , and when eight or nine more dams are built ( if ever ) , will open some 600 miles of the Columbia River to navigation . At present one boat with 600-ton capacity is being built and half a dozen 300-ton barges are planned to make use of the 50 miles of new watercourse . <P> Navigation , however , is not the chief problem involved in the administration of the new dam , nor are the fish problems . Two salmon ladders were built-cascades with steps one foot high and 16 ft. wide . Six salmon " elevators " or fish locks were also provided . These are chambers 20 by 30 ft. into which the salmon may swim ; then a gate is closed and a grating , similar to an elevator , rises until the fish can swim out into the reservoir above the dam . These devices have not yet been tested , for salmon are still able to swim between the piers of the unfinished dam . Unfortunately salmon swim blindly into places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salmon a day which pass upstream at spawning time do not like the new conveniences provided for them , it will be just too bad for the $10,000,000-a-year Columbia River salmon industry. * <P> But last week it appeared that from the beginning the Power tail is to wag the dam dog at Bonneville . Not to ship experts or fish experts but to power experts did Franklin Roosevelt go for advice on Bonneville 's " incidental " problem . The President 's Committee on National Power Policy ( created six weeks ago ) recommended in its first report that an administrator be appointed for Bonneville to conduct its operations along lines " not incompatible with any national power policy which may ultimately be established . " <P> The outlines of this ultimate power policy were foreshadowed by the chief recommendations of the committee for Bonneville : <P> To prevent the waste of surplus power , the Bonneville administrator should be empowered to build transmission lines , substations , etc. etc . More than that , he should have a power ( which TVA does not have ) " to acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal property , franchises , electric transmission lines and facilities as may be necessary " - in short to condemn and take over private facilities .
