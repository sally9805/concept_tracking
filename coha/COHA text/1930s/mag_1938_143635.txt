" I wish you all a very Happy New Year . . . . " <P> With this ingratiating preamble , Franklin Delano Roosevelt this week began to discharge his constitutional duty of addressing Congress on the State of the Union . Surrounded by microphones , against a background formed by Vice President Garner and House Speaker William Bankhead ( see cut ) , the President proceeded to cover assorted aspects of the Union 's condition without concentrating on any one . His address lacked the fire of his historic denunciation of " entrenched greed " in 1936 , the amiability of his complacent curtain-raiser to the Supreme Court fight a year ago . Its 4,000 words had , instead , a special quality of earnest persuasiveness combined with that vigorous self assurance which is characteristically Rooseveltian . His major points : <P> War and Peace . Without referring to the Panay incident by name , he said : " I am thankful that I can tell you that our nation is at peace . It has been kept at peace despite provocations which , in other days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . . . . <P> " Resolute in our determination to respect the rights of others , and to command respect for the rights of ourselves , we must keep ourselves adequately strong in self-defense . " <P> Legislative Program . The working plan which the President originally laid down for Congress last autumn contained five items of which one-anti-trust legislation-was left out of his message to the Special Session two months ago . This week , the President omitted another-Regional Planning-recommended for enactment 1 ) the Farm Bill , 2 ) a wages- &-hours; bill and 3 ) modernized anti-trust laws . Of the first : " It is shameless misrepresentation to call this a policy of scarcity . It is in truth insurance before the fact instead of Government subsidy after the fact . " Of the second ( which the House sent back to Committee in the Special Session ) : " We are seeking of course only legislation to end starvation wages and intolerable hours . . . . Wage and hour legislation ... is ... definitely before this Congress for action . " Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow ) : " Capital is essential ; reasonable earnings on capital are essential ; but misuse of the powers of capital or selfish suspension of the employment of capital must be ended or the capitalistic system will destroy itself through its own abuses . ... " <P> Budget- " The proposed budget for 1939 the fiscal year beginning next July 1 , which I shall shortly send to the Congress , will exhibit a further decrease in the deficit , though not an actual balance . " <P> Taxes , " In relation to tax changes , three things should be kept in mind . First , the total sum to be derived by the Federal Treasury must not be decreased . . . . Second , abuses by individuals or corporations designed to escape tax-paying by using various methods of doing business , corporate and otherwise-abuses which we have sought , with great success , to end- must not be restored . Third , we should rightly change certain provisions where they are proven to work definite hardship , especially on the small businessmen of the nation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
