did n't lie , " interrupted Rugg . " There 's none better nowhere . " " I 've seen a lot of horseflesh , " put in Finney , eyeingEllery coldly , " but never anything better than what Cayetano raises here on his place . " " I had the good fortune to spend two nights with Captain Bidwell at his rancho in the Sacramento , " said Ellery , answering Don Cayetano 's question . " We were looking over his horses when he told me of your animals . To tell the truth , it was the story of them that made me ride so far south on my journeyfrom Shasta to San Francisco . " Don Cayetano was upon his feet now . He bowed . " Had you ridden a thousand leagues , your time would not have been ill spent , Senor Ellery , for I swear that in all California there are no finer horses than those of Rancho Linda Vista . " Ellery knew that the don was not boasting , for Bidwell of Rancho Chico had told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had managed to get from Don Cayetano 's band . Meanwhile Finney 's thin lips were compressed under his red mustache , and his eyes were squinted and calculating . Rugg was scowling , and Hailey 's cold eyes followed every movement Ellery made . He leaned over and whispered something to Rugg . Rugg shrugged an answer . " I would buy a horse of Rancho Linda Vista , Don Cayetano , " said Ellery , " if you have one for sale . " Don Cayetano looked his visitor over , from the toes 20of his polished boots to the crown of his expensive sombrero . " The best caballo you will want , senor , " he declared . " And be satisfied with nothing less . " " The best has never been any too good for Jim Ellery , " the visitor returned with a smile . " I am willing to pay you well . " " Sometimes it stands a feller in good , stead to be up on the best horse , " Finney ventured . " Maybe a question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellery gave the handsome young red-head an understandingsmile . " I see you savvy the value of a good horse yourself , Finney . " " That 's right . Like you , the best is none too good for Jack Finney , stranger . I paid Cayetano five hundredpesos gold for that bay yonder . " Ellery glanced at the ' animal , then back at Finney . " He 's worth it . " " He sure is , " agreed Finney . Don Cayetano clapped his hands , and presently two mozos appeared from the shade of a great fig tree and ambled up the slope . " Sleepy pigs , " Don Cayetano cried , not ill-naturedly , " wake you and lead out El Real for the caballero to see . " The prospect of leading out the fine horse aroused the drowsy peons . As they trotted away Rugg said : " You mentioned bein ' up Shasta way , Ellery . How 's things up there ? " 21 " Fairly good . I had a rich claim on Clear Creek , but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang still runnin ' loose up there ? " went on Rugg . " I hear they was plenty bad three , four years ago . " " There 's still plenty of talk up there about Harper and his cut-throats , " said Ellery , " but they have n't been heard of since they stuck up the stage from Whiskeytown to Redding more than two years ago , though Captain Bidwell told me it is thought they are responsible for some of the killings and robberies along the Feather and Yuba since then . " " To my way of thinkin ' that ai n't likely , " Finney put in . " From what I heard , Harper and his men got enough from that Whiskeytown hold-up to last ' em the rest of their lives . They likely headed back east where they come from , or south into Mexico or Texas , where there ai n't quite so much law and order . " " I hope they stay , wherever they went , " Rugg declaredwith ' a curse . " I met this Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole a year 's hard washin ' of dust from me and my pardner , and never so much as said thankee . " " Haw , haw , haw ! " chuckled Hailey , his sallow face for the first time showing any expression . " I always like to hear you tell that yarn , Rugg . Why ' n hell ' d you let ' em'take it ? " " I reckon if you 'd had a dozen guns poked agin you , you 'd let ' em take it , " grunted Rugg . " There 's plenty more gold , but I ai n't got nine lives like a cat . I reckon you 'd put up a fight . " 22 " I might ' a ' done just that , " said Hailey , Ellery recalled what he had heard of Harper and his gang , how the miners had run them out of the Shasta country , how it had been reported that Vigilantes had taken the law into their own hands on the Feather and Yuba , and how , though some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader had always managed to escape , usually to lead another and more daring raid , as if by it to show his defiance . Soon the mozos came in sight leading the horse up the slope , and Ellery had no ' thoughts except for the beautiful animal . Don Cayetano took the hair rope from the peon who held it . " He ees El Real , " the hidalgo said proudly . " He ees the finest of all the fine caballos of Rancho Linda Vista . A finer horse have you ever seen , Senor Ellery ? " " I never have , " Ellery answered slowly . The animal was such a light sorrel that it was almost a palomino ' in coloring . Its long mane and full arched tail , however , were flaxen , such as might have better fitted a chestnut sorrel . Ellery walked slowly round and round the horse , examining with open admiration the muscled forequarters , the deep chest , the neatly turned flanks , the perfectly moulded stifles and pasterns , the small , trim hoofs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Blue Grass , Ellery 's love and knowledge of good horses was instinctive . He told himself that but for color , he had never seen a more perfect specimen , of horseflesh . El Real was fully23sixteen hands high , and his every line bespoke speed and endurance . " El Real , he ees un ver ' fine caballo , no ? " demandedDon Cayetano . " He is a beauty , " declared Ellery . He took the halter-rope , and after stroking the sleek head and looking into the soft brown eyes , lifted the upper lip . " Six years old , eh ? " " Six years last spring , senor , " replied Don Cayetano . Ellery ran his experienced hands down the trim legs  --  not a blemish . He turned to ask Finney 's opinion of the horse , but discovered that the red-head was nowhere in sight . " What do you boys think , of him ? " he asked . " He 's sure one fine hoss , " returned Rugg . " I never seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own him , " grunted Halley . " Cayetano 's goin ' to separate you from plenty dust , stranger , before that hoss belongs to you . " " A thousand pesos , " said Don Cayetano . " Not a centavo more , nor a centavo less . My price do I get for El Real , or he remains my saddle horse on Rancho Linda Vista , Senor Ellery . " Silver spurs jingling , body swaying lightly at the hips , there was something feline in Finney 's movementsas he entered the casa . Inside the big livingroom , with its massive oaken table and many rawhidecoveredchairs , he stopped , leaned forward , rested his hands on the guns at his hips . Except for the door , the24large room was lighted only by two small windows at the easterly side , and now that the sun , was in the west , the illumination was not good . Finney whistled softly . A door at the farther side opened , and Carlotta appeared , vivid as ever . She laughed as she ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His fingers clasped back of her supple waist . Presently she leaned back , that she might look into his face . The crimson patches were playing hideand-seekunder the soft olive of her cheeks , and her eyes shone with passion and admiration for this redheadedman . " Ah , mi Jack , you are ver ' angry , ver ' jealous ? " she asked . " You think I am the bad girl , no ? " " You did it fine , Carlotta . Could n't have done it better if we 'd rehearsed it , but be careful you do n't fall in love with that good-looking gringo . " " You would have the ' and-some gringo fall in loll with Carlotta ? " she demanded naively . " From the looks of hees guns and hees eyes , he might make the fight for the girl eef he loll her ver ' mucho . " " What you want is to make him love you , Carlotta , " he whispered . " I 'll take the chance that you do n't love him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be any , muchacha . He has much gold , sabe ? " " Oooh ! " she cried . " Mucho oro , si . Never have I seen so much gold . " He checked her with an oath . " Listen to me , Carlotta ! I want that gold . Sabe ? " She drew back against his clasped hands , looked up archly , a little defiantly. 25j " And you ' spec ' Carlotta to help you get all the gold ? " " I expect you to see that this hombre do n't get away from this rancho to-night , " he corrected with a chuckle . " You can leave the rest to me and the boys . " " But suppose Carlotta should fall in loff with the caballero ? From his gold he must be the ver ' rich , no ? " " He 's richer now than he 'll be to-morrow , and likely a lot better lookin ' , " he growled as he suddenly unclaspedhis hands . As suddenly the fingers of one hand clamped about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Will you do as I say or do I have to choke you ? " She did not flinch under the cruel pressure of his fingers , before the burning command in his eyes . Tears welled into hers . " You are hurt me , Jack , " she whispered . " You are hurt your Carlotta ! " His fingers relaxed , and he- chuckled metallically . She flung her arms about his neck , buried her face in his gay jacket . " Damned if I know whether to trust you always or not , " he muttered . " Listen to me ! I want that gold , and I do n't want you to fall in love with this Ellery . If you do , somebody 's pretty throat 's goin ' to be slit . " Her eyes were moist , her lips quivering as she looked up . " Jack , eef I was the ver ' bad girl , eet was because for you ! I was for see in your eyes that you want 26that gold , the ver ' minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the beeg chair with your Carlotta . " Don Cayetano was explaining how the distant forebearsof El Real , the Royal , had been brought from Spain by the Conquistadores . They had been of pure Arabian strain . Fifty years before , a magnificent stallion , direct descendant of the original Arabians , had been brought across the long desert trail and up the coast to Mission Santa Barbara by Don Esteban Esqueval , Don Cayetano 's grandfather . " In California , " went on the hidalgo , " the Arabian has been crossed with the finest of the native stock , and you see the result , Don Jeem . The sire of El Real ees none less than the famous Rey de Monterey , that ees owned by the illustrious gubernador of California , Senor Alvarado . Have you the pleasure of knowing El Gubernador ? " " It is my misfortune that I do not , " said Ellery . " A misfortune indeed , senor . Eet was from El Gubernador that I obtained this grant , ten leagues of land , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eet not a magnificent view off yonder toward the distantmountains , senor , as the sun hangs low ? " " Very beautiful , " replied Ellery , his mind on the horse . " Don Cayetano , I will give you five hundred dollars for Real . " Don Cayetano flung up his hands . Did not the caballero know a thoroughbred when he saw one ? Did he not know that a good cow-pony was worth half that27much , and that El Real was so gentle and well broken that even a woman might safely ride him ? Ellery 's journeyings had thrown him into frequent contact with men like Don Cayetano , and he had learned their innate propensity for bargaining . He raised his offer to six hundred dollars . Don Cayetano dropped to nine hundred . Ten minutes later they agreed on seven hundred and fifty . Ellery was transferringhis saddle to the back of the sorrel when Finney swaggered from the house . He stopped and grinned . " What 'd you pay for the caballo , Ellery ? " " Seven fifty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all he 's worth . " Finney chuckled . " I see you 're no tenderfoot . You know how to deal with these Mexicans . " Don Cayetano spread his hands and shrugged in sad despair , declaring that for the price he had made Ellery a present of the fine animal . " All the presents you make I can put- in my hat , " Finney declared with a , grin . " I want a word with you , Cayetano . " They walked some distance aside , and for a few minutes talked in low tones , after which Finney called to his men . Finney , with the same feline grace , swung into his saddle . Rugg and Hailey mounted , and the three galloped down the slope and along the lane to southward . " They live near , Don Cayetano ? " Ellery asked as he tested a stirrup . " Two leagues of my land toward the Tuolumne28have I sold them . They are starting a cattle rancho . " Don Cayetano shrugged wearily . " Alas , I fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not caballeros like yourself , Senor Ellery. " 29CHAPTER IIIFinney and his companions had reached the foothills and were rounding a patch of chaparral when they saw a horseman approaching . At Finney 's command the trio reined up . " It 's Tex , " said the red-head . The man came on at a gallop , and drew up with a flourish . He was armed like the other three , but dressed differently , in jeans and boots and cotton shirt . His hat was the low , flat-crowned affair of the Americans , instead of the peaked Mexican sombrero . He was tall , lean , with cold blue eyes and a drooping yellowish mustache . " Howdy , " said Finney . " Howdy , Jack , " returned Tex Winder . " How 's things at the rancho ? " " Muy bueno , " Finney answered with a dry chuckle . " There 's unexpected pickin ' there to-night , stranger rode in from the north , grass-bellied with dust . " Tex rolled a cigarette and puffed impassively while Finney told of Ellery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine horse from Don Cayetano . " Mean to get that gold ? " queried Tex . " I 'm goin ' to get it , " corrected Finney . " Everything'sfixed. " 30 " I reckon as how the girl 's goin ' to be of some help ? " " A little , " Finney chuckled . " What 'd you find in Columbia , Tex ? " The men dismounted , drew the reins over the heads of their horses , and squatted on their heels beside the trail . " The bank 'll be easy , " Tex said . " I got the lay of everything , and it 's got plenty of dust and coin . " " Damn the dust , " interrupted Finney . " It 's too common . What we want is coin . Get time to ride back to the cabin ? " " Yeah , took a pack-horse load of stuff back with me . Wal , as for coin , I reckon there 's plenty . The town 's full of money , and the mines is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen so much money ! " Without emotion Hailey suggested that it ought to be a thirty or forty thousand dollar haul . " Ca n't tell just how much , " replied Tex , " but it 'll be big . She 's sure a rich camp , if I know the signs . " " You ought to , " declared Finney , not without admiration for this calculating lieutenant of his . " What 'd you find out about that rich feller they call the colonel , and his daughter ? " " The colonel 's there all right , and from the way it looks he 's got plenty dinero , Jack . Fine lookin ' old gent , too . And I saw the girl , got a line on her . She sure likes horses , and rides about the finest I ever set eyes on , takes a ride every day just after dinner . I met her a couple of times on the trail . She 's a good lookin ' piece , quality , too . " 31 " Damn her looks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is does she look like she 's worth money ? " Tex chuckled as he rolled another cigarette . " From what the colonel seems to think of her she 's worth plenty to him . " Tex had apparently done his reconnoitering thoroughly , and Finney was pleased with him and with the anticipation of a rich haul . " Now looky here , Jack , " said Rugg . " With all this dinero in sight what 's the use of takin ' a chance with that feller back at the rancho ? If I 'm any judge , that hombre 's bad . " Rugg ceased speaking as Finney turned a livid face upon him . " Who the hell 's runnin ' this outfit , Rugg ? I do n't care a damn who that hombre back at the rancho is , or how bad he is . He 's got at least ten thousand in his saddle-bags , and I need just that much dinero . " " Sure , I know that , " Rugg returned without apology , " but it 'll be takin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know Carlotta . That hombre 'll either be asleep or dead drunk when I see him next time . Boys , it 'll be so easy it makes me ashamed of myself . Besides , I want Real , along with his dust . I 'll always be down on Cayetano because he would n't sell me that horse . " Finney told little of his plan to get Ellery 's gold , but enough to explain that it included murder if this was necessary . The sun was low over the Coast Range when he ordered the three men to ride on . " I 'll wait here till after dark , and head for the rancho , " he explained . " I 'll be into camp by mid-32night . You fellers tend to the plans , and do n't overlookanything . " Ellery did not have enough coin to pay for the horse , but Don Cayetano agreed to accept gold-dust . As there was no means of weighing the nuggets , Ellery suggested that a heaping cup of them should equal seven hundred and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew this would be ample measure . He poured the dust into a leather pouch , and was tying it when Carlotta ran from the casa . The girl stopped before Ellery , disappointment in her eyes . " Don Jeem , you are not going ? " " I must be on my way , " replied Ellery , not unmovedby her vivid beauty and the veiled promise in her eyes . " But where , Don Jeem ? No , no , you must not go thees night , or I will be distract . Now that peeg of a red-head ees gone , I had counted on having such a ver ' fine veesit ! The hospitality of Rancho Linda Vista ees all yours for the asking . But say the word you will stay , and a feast I will order , ees eet not true , padre mio ? " " Him have I told many times that our casa is his casa , " said Don Cayetano , " and I am grieved that he will not at least spend the night with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . There was more than a plea now in her half-closed eyes , her red lips. 33 " You are not ver ' gallant to Carlotta , " she said with a little pout . " Ees eet all senoritas you treat like thees , man of stone with no fire in heel heart ? " " You are very pretty , Carlotta , " Ellery said , " but I have urgent business ahead . " Don Cayetano reiterated his invitation , but Ellery was obdurate , though it took all his will power to refuse , for he was tired and he was not unconscious of the girl 's charm . " You have forgotten the red-headed caballero , " he suggested with a smile that crinkled the tiny crow-feet at the corners of his eyes . " Unless I am mistaken he will be very jealous if I remain . I have heard much of the anger of love-smitten men with red hair , senorita . " She tilted her head as if to see him better in the declining rays of the sun . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . " That do I care for the red-head ! He ees much less as . nothing to Carlotta , Don Jeem . Please stay , jus ' for to-night . Eef you do not , leetle Carlotta. will be the ver ' lonesome senorita , ver ' lonesome ! " Ellery seemed hesitating , and she took full advantage of his vacillation . To her guile Don Cayetano again added his hospitable invitation . " Bueno , " accepted Ellery , " but first I must try out my beautiful caballo . I have not yet tried him under a saddle , and he may be no better than a sheep , senorita . " " If a sheep he ees , ten times your gold you shall have back , senor , " Don Cayetano declared haughtily . 34 " I will wager el rancho that you will say never a finer caballo did you have under you ! " Carlotta 's glance caressed Ellery , and there was half-tearful disappointment in her eyes when he turned away . He was striding to his horse when she cried impetuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not go . " She called to one of the grinning peons . " Pedro , lazy son of a sow , La Reina ! Pronto , lest I have you lashed ! " Pedro ran toward the long adobe stable where the finer horses were kept . Carlotta turned to Ellery . " Don Jeem , alone I must not let you ride . You must see La Reina . She ees won'erful , but 000h , not so won'erful as your El Real . " Carlotta ran into the house , and by the time the peons were leading her saddled horse up the knoll she had reappeared . At first glance Ellery did not recognize her . She had on mauve charro trousers with lines of silver conchas down their outer seams , and a flaming jacket embroidered in gold thread . A silken scarf of brilliant yellow was about her throat . Her blue-black hair was hidden under a small sombrero , the peak and band of which were ornamented with silver filagree . She stopped before Ellery and her father , and bowed low . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You certainly are ! " Ellery declared . " I never saw a prettier one . " " Carlotta ! " cried her father . " A brazen hoyden you are , girl . But , Lord , how I love you ! It ill be- ( 35comes a daughter of Don Cayetano to act thus . Have you no shame ? " " Por Dios , padre mio , shame I have , of course , but you will not deny me the leetle fun , no ? Perhaps eef Don Jeem , he sees I am only a , good-looking boy , he will not be so bashful , and will consent to remain for the night with us . Ees that not true , my timid Don Jeem ? " " I told you I would stay for the night , senorita . " Ellery was looking at the approaching horse . " Buena ! Bueno ! " cried Carlotta . " Such hospitalityyou will find at Rancho Linda Vista ! Padre , will you tell old Felipa to prepare a gran ' feast ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the one he had bought . Then he noted that the sleek coat was a shade darker , and the animal was a mare and not a gelding . " Half sister she ees to El Real , " said Don Cayetano , " and a year older , senor . " The girl gave the mare a caress and swung into the silver-ornamented saddle . " Listo , Don Jeem ? " she queried eagerly . " I 'm ready , senorita . Hasta luego , Don Cayetano . " Ellery had touched the stirrup when the girl cried out : " The gold , Don Jeem ? It will be safe with mi padre . " Ellery did not pause his graceful swing into the saddle . " I shall take the gold . I want to see how Real travels under a full load . I often ride heavy . " 36The girl reined down the southerly side of the knoll in the direction Finney and his men had taken , but Ellery called to her . " Dispenseme , senorita , but I think we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . She clattered up beside him and they rode down the slope and out the short lane between the patches of beans and chili , and onto the open plain , which now the slanting sun was lighting until in the far distance it shone orange-blue and opalescent . A man less wary than Jim Ellery would have been intrigued , persuaded by the soft splendor of the scene , the vivid creature beside him . There was a little smile playing about the ends of his mouth as he turned to her . " You are very beautiful , Carlotta . " " Theenk you really so , Don Jeem ? " " I am sure of it , but are you as smart as you are pretty ? " Something like suspicion flashed into her eyes . Her delicately rounded shoulders moved in a slight shrug . " Quien sabe , Don Jeem ? Women are never what you call clever , no ? Men do not like them that way . " " What about a. race ? " he demanded . " An ounce of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabbit you call my beautiful Reina ? Bah ! That ees but a crippled coyote you yourself ride , Don Jeem . " They were off , at first in an even canter with reins held tight . Then as the reins slackened the magnificentanimals stretched out , side by side , supple mus-37cles working rhythmically . Faster , faster they went , till the plain seemed to slide under them like a brown carpet . The girl leaned slightly forward . The wind dragged a tendril of her blue-black hair from under the silverornamentedhat . She turned toward Ellery , who was riding as though he were one with horse and saddle . " Won'erful you ride , Don Jeem ! " she cried . " But thees ees not running . Spurs you must put to that crippled coyote , or you will be lost . " Then she flashed ahead , but instantly Ellery 's mount stretched his stride , quickened it . Over the dry turf they flew now , straight into the north , where brown plain and azure sky met . Try as he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurs as she would , Carlotta could not draw away . The animals were of a size , and Ellery saw that the girl had the advantage , with her lighter weight . Not since he had left Kentucky had he so thrilled with the appreciation of good horseflesh . The lure of a race had been born into his blood as much as the instinct to love fine horses . Half a mile they ran into the north . Then Ellery began swerving in a. wide arc toward the foothills . Carlotta was quick to see the change of course , and reined in abreast . Ellery 's spurs touched gently . The gelding responded so quickly that before she could realize it , Carlotta was three lengths behind . Now she rode as she had not ridden before , but the gap slowly widened as the two reaching animals flashed across the plain . The ground was gently rising toward the chap- 38 1arral-covered foothills when Ellery reined up , stopped . The girl slid the mare to her haunches beside him . " Por Dios ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diablo heemself do you ride , Don Jeem ! Never before have I seen such a caballero . For your riding alone I could loff you ! " " You 're all right as a rider , Carlotta , " he told her , " but when it comes to acting , you 're a poor excuse . " " Don Jeem ! What mean you ? Are you make fun of me ? " " I ought to laugh , Carlotta , but it would n't be the right thing . " " Am I that funny you must laugh , Don Jeem ? " Then with one of her quick changes of mood she spurred in close . Her knee touched his , her hands dropped upon his , which rested on the pommel . " You are not the fun make of leetle Carlotta. , who loff you , Don Jeem , so ver ' , ver ' mucho , no ? " Tears glistened on her long , curved lashes . " Listen to me , muchacha , and listen well , " Ellery commanded in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easy to see through as a pane of glass . I am not riding back to the rancho . You can offer my regrets to your kind father , and tell him I am more than satisfied with Real . " " Back to el rancho you are not going , Don Jeem ? " " That 's right ! " " But why ? Ees eet something Carlotta has done which has offend ? " He caught her wrist in a grasp that made her wince , and when he spoke his voice was hard. 39 " If I go back to the rancho , I 'll be a dead manbefore the sun rises again . Why , Carlotta , I saw through your scheme the minute you first jumped up and ran to me there under the oaks . There was much in the flash of an eye that passed between you and Senor Finney  --  as you call him . Please tell Senor Finney , the next time you are in his arms , that Jim Ellery is as bad a bandit as he ever dreamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men than all his gang combined . " " Don Jeem ! " she whispered . " I was know you were ver ' bad man , that was why I loff you so from the first ! Ah , Carlotta she knew you were worse as el diablo heemself . Corazon , ride back to el rancho with Carlotta , and she will prove to you she ees ver ' simpatica . Please , Don Jeem ! " Her pleading , baffled eyes caught no hint of yieldingin his . She jerked away , tossed her head . " So ? You scorn the loff of Carlotta ? " she cried fiercely . " A day will come " I would n't give one hair out of this horse 's tail for all your love , Carlotta , " he said coldly . " Take your love back to Senor Finney and tell him , with my compliments , to go to hell ! " Ellery touched spurs to his horse and was away up the slope toward the chaparral . Like a dull yellow flash the girl 's mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat tense , baffled , until horse and rider had disappeared in the brush . It was ten minutes before Carlotta turned to ride slowly back to the rancho , heart-heavy and somber , 40for the strange part of it was that she did love Jim Ellery , and with all the hot , unreasoning impetuosity of her savage nature . Sadly , yet with defiance , she wondered what she was going to tell Finney . " Ver ' angry the red one will be , " she told herself with a mirthless little laugh . " Already he could feel hees feengairs on the gold of Don Jeem . " Afar , over the summits of the Coast Range , the settingsun was painting the crests of the cloud masses in orange and crimson and gold . The shadow deepened on the plain , and out of the south a cold wind came , chilling a little more the blood which only a short while ago had run so hot in Carlotta 's veins . She was slumped in her saddle , a dejected little figure , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hoofs Don Cayetano came from the casa . Carlotta swung from the saddle and tossed the reins to a mozo . " Por Dios ! " cried Don Cayetano . " Where is el Americano ? " " Puerco ! " Carlotta said fiercely . " The dog , he would not leesten to me . He lied ! I am ver ' glad he ees gone ! " Something like a smile of grim satisfaction played across Don Cayetano 's aristocratic face , but it was twilight under the oaks and his daughter did not see it . " A wise man I reasoned your Don Jim was , my daughter , " he said in Spanish . " A wise man it always is who knows a good horse , and has much gold . It is the way of these Americans to treasure their gold , too , as much as they treasure their worthless lives . Woe to us for the day they ever set foot in this beautifulcountry , which was all ease and peace and happinessuntil they came . " He spread his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You speak like an old man who is afraid , " sneered the angry girl . " I am not old . Neither am I frightened , " Don 42jCayetano said sadly , " but it is hard for a man who has been reared a gentleman to be otherwise , even when necessity forces him to become the consort of vile men who are not of his own race , my dear . " Carlotta was chagrined , more at having her love spurned than at the loss of the gold Ellery had carried . She ran past her father into the big house , where she proceeded to vent her anger upon the criadas for not having supper on the table . A chill wind was sucking down from the hills , and the night was black except for the scintillating stars when Finney approached Rancho Linda Vista . Insteadof riding boldly up the knoll , he left his horse behind an adobe at its foot , removed his spurs , and hitched up the belt that held his knife and gun . This was a night for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some peons were singing . Peace seemed to hover over Rancho Linda Vista , but there was no peace in Finney 's heart , and even less in the heart of pretty Carlotta . The girl , who for an hour had waited on the bench under the oaks , rose as she made out the familiar figure approaching . " Jack ! " she called softly . The figure stopped , searched the gloom . " ' Well ? " " Eet ees I , Carlotta . " She ran to meet him , would have thrown herself into his arms had h , e not thrust her back . " Where 's the hombre with the gold ? " he demanded in a savage whisper 43 " Por Dios , Jack , he ees gone ! " " Gone ? Gone where ? " With trembling lips she told the story , a story repletewith humiliation and confessions of her own unworthiness , while her hands crept out in vain attempt to sense his forgiveness . He grasped her shoulders , shook her . " I ought to slit your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have n't they brains of a jack rabbit . " In a flash her mood changed . She squirmed from under his hands , sprang back , faced him with eyes that gleamed , even in the gloom . " Let him get away I did not , Jack ! He went , went , went ! " Her voice rose shrilly . " He went , though I tried with all my heart , all my soul to keep heem . Don Jeem ees un ver ' wise , ver ' mal hombre , when he will not let leetle Carlotta make her loff to heem . " " Well , he 's gone , and there 's no use grievin ' over spilt milk , " he growled profanely . " What 's this you say about him bein ' bad ? " " He ees tell me for tell you , Jack , " she managed to wriggle into his lax embrace , " that he ees keel more men as you and all your mal hombres ! " " Killed more men ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think " He ees un mal hombre , thees Don Jeem . Do you not recall now that he had a wise look , a ver ' hard look ? " The devil-may-care look was back in Ellery 's eyes , and the grin on his face seemed ready to break into a 44chuckle as he reined up on an open slope and gazed at the darkening plain across which a solitary rider was traveling . " She 's one mad girl , " he said aloud . " But Carlotta , your work 's so crude a cock-eyed man could see through it . Unless I 'm a liar , Rancho Linda Vista is little more than a thieves ' nest . But I 'll say one thing for Don Cayetano . He raises good horses . " Ellery stroked the sleek neck of his mount , wonderingvaguely what the color of it was . He decided that it was about the shade of strong coffee with plenty of rich cream in it . There came to him the realization that his love for fine horses was second only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wondered if he would ever find a girl that suited him for a wife as this magnificent horse suited him for a mount . When he found her would she be like Carlotta , vivid , bold , primitive , almost savage in her passionsand desires and cunning ? He rode on . The night dropped about him . As the chill wind met his face he took his coat from back of the cantle and buttoned it about him . As he had ridden up to Rancho Linda Vista , Ellery 's plan had been to purchase the best horse Don Cayetanohad , and then head west for Altamont or Pacheco pass , and ride on to San Francisco . Now his plan was definitely changed . He had made a discovery , a discoverywhich must be reported to the officers at Sonora or Columbia . What his plans might be after this Ellery did not know . Life to him was a good deal like a story , unfolding , developing as it is written , and45often stopping where roads branched , leaving the puzzledwriter undecided for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not perturbed , not impatient . For years he had wanted to visit the famous camps of the SouthernMines . Perhaps after he had seen them he would ride to San Francisco , have his fling , and head back to the Northern Mines which had been so generous with him . This was a new country to him , and in the dark , a somewhat baffling one . Real kept trying to head back toward the great valley . It was a region of chaparral , of wide swales and grassy ridges ever lifting toward the black slopes of the Sierras . Across it Ellery rode , slowly , for it was no place for speed and he had no desire to ride fast . He kept his direction by the stars and the valley behind him and the black slopes ahead . He came to gulches where miners had abandoned their diggings because of the lack of water for washing in the long dry summer and autumn . In the pitchy blackness he crossed the Sonora road without knowing it , and continued eastward . It was nearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this night was concerned . He had a little food in his saddle-bags . He reined up in a small swale deeply carpeted with dry grass . About him on the ridge Digger-pines and white-oaks stood out , their crooked branches in silhouette against the stars . Feeling that he was far enough from Rancho Linda Vista for safety , Ellery unsaddled and tethered his horse , who began to nibble fastidiously at the dry46fox-tail . Soon Ellery had a fire blazing at the edge of the clearing . The fire started to spread to the dry grass , but he whipped it out with a bush after letting it burn over a narrow circle . He ate his food , rolled a cigarette , and sat down on his saddle to meditate . The night was colder than he had anticipated , and soon frost gleamed on the dew-touched grass outside the radius of the fire . Under the chill stars a flock of wild geese honked their way southward . At intervals coyotes howled dolefully , as if with complaints of the approach of winter . Ellery built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the saddle for a pillow , and tried to sleep , but slumber would not come . His mind was too full , his body too virile . He reviewed the events at Rancho Linda Vista , mapped his plans for the immediatefuture . From time to time he rose to replenish the fire , for as the hours wore into morning the cold became more biting . Out of the present , out of the recent past his thoughts drifted , across the mountains , across the vast desert reaches which five years before he had traveled with a wagon-train bound for the West , back to his old home in the Blue-Grass . With these memories came a sudden decision . He would get across the mountains before snow blocked the trails , and go back home . His eyes were tender as he pictured the surpriseof his mother and father . He saw the old home , staid , comfortable , with its fluted white pillars extendingto the level of the second-story roof . He could hear the darkies singing in their cabins next the fields47of tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been at sixteen . And had she married ? He would ride into Columbia or Sonora , tell the officers what he had discovered , help them prove it if they asked , then take the Mono Pass trail across the mountains . He had recognized the signs , but felt sure he could get across into the sage desert before winter fell . Impatient now , chilled , unable to sleep , Ellery saddledabout three o'clock . The straggling , wind-driven clouds had formed a solid canopy , and the night was black as ink . It was the horse as much as the rider that found the way around patches of manzanita and chaparral , through them . At times Ellery led the animal , lest it should be injured in some rocky descent . By the first hint of the cold dawn he was in a splendidforest , tall pines and firs rising ghostlike about him . Among them spread frequent black-oaks . The air was filled with balsam and the perfume of the morning dew . Strangely , Ellery had for miles traversed a region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not come upon a single human habitation . Once he had smelled smoke , but the shifting , puffy winds had prevented his locating it . Dawn revealed a sky leaden and cold . The wind moaned through the forest with a dirge-like promise of early winter . Ellery tied Real to a tree , and finding a fallen log , built a fire near it , and curled up with his back against the log . He was asleep within five min- 48utes . When he awoke he stared up through the treetopsto a brighter spot in the clouds that told him how high the sun was . " Ten o'clock , " he muttered . His watch showed ten thirty . He was ravenously hungry , but his first thought was of food for his horse . There was no grass in the forest , only the inevitable " mountain misery , " a short , fernlikeweed that seemed to grow everywhere . The tarry secretion of the weed had caked the animal 's legs to the knees . A survey of the country from an open slope told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must drop down to find the settlements . He set out in an arc to northward , meaning to reach the head of a long basin he could see . It was past noon when he came to a trail and reined into it . There were patches of manzanita and mountain-lilac now interspersed among the pines and oaks . The trail was rounding the end of a thicket when Real suddenly thrust his short ears forward and quickened his light step . Ellery was prepared for a meeting with some miner trudging back to his diggings , but not for what he saw as he rounded the point of brush . Not twenty paces away stood a fine sorrel , every inch a thoroughbred , if Ellery 's astonished eyes knew anything about horses . It was not the fine animal , however , that held his attention after the first quick look . Beside the horse a girl was straightening up , as if she had just released one of the sorrel 's hoofs . She 49was slim , of medium height , and wore a long ridinghabitof dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid her soft brown hair . At sight of the man on the coffee-colored horse she uttered a little cry , and with a quick gesture released the tucked-up skirt of the long habit . It fell about her slim ankles and lay in folds upon the ground . The horse was holding up its right forefoot . Ellery swept off his sombrero . Even now he could not believe that his eyes were seeing this beautiful girl . A creature like her had no place in this primitive forest . Her delicately oval face was flushed with exertionand embarrassment . " Good day , ma'am , " said Ellery . " Good day , sir . " Her soft , half-hesitant reply flashed Ellery back to the Blue-Grass , through the South . He was off his horse before he realized it . He bowed as he advanced . " May I be of some assistance , Miss " Thank you . Tennessee has picked up a stone . I was trying to dislodge it . I shall be mightily obliged . " " Both thoroughbreds , " Ellery mused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefoot , he found a hard , flat stone wedged into the shoe . He grabbed up another stone and rapped the flat one out , but he did not immediately drop the hoof . The shoe , a slim , skilfully fashioned strip of iron , interested him for a few moments . It was not the shoe of an ordinary saddle horse . He straightened to see the girl six feet away . Was she real ? Was she a dream ? Was he crazy ? 50 " Thank you , " she said with a little curtsey . " I hardly know what I would have done alone , and I could not ride a lame horse , you see . " Without knowing it , Ellery was staring at her , for she set his brain awhirl , so strangely did she contrast with the girls he had met since coming to California . Her delicate beauty , her evident refinement , her gentle , wide-set gray eyes all seemed so unreal that he felt an urge to sweep her into his arms to see whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bone like himself . And in that short survey he compared her with Carlotta Esqueval , the brazen , primitive girl of Rancho Linda Vista ; and found himself wondering if , after all , she were like Carlotta inside . The girl was flushing at the close scrutiny . " I beg your pardon . I am James Ellery . " A smile flashed over her sweet face , and when she spoke it was in a soft drawl , and she slurred her r 's . " I am pleased to make your acquaintance , Mister Ellery . I am Nancy Beaufort . " Ellery started to take a step toward her outstretched hand , but as she moved quickly to meet him , one of her small boots caught in the folds of her skirt and she toppled toward him . With a leap he reached out , but instead of setting her on her feet , he swept her into his arms , lifted her . Then before either of them knew what was happening , he was kissing her upon the mouth . Three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sudden shock . Then she was fighting 51like a tigress . Ellery , now almost as stunned as she , set her upon her feet , and stepped back . His face had gone white with the realization of what he had done . " You cur ! You coward ! You brute ! " she cried . " How dare you ? I have a mind " She half lifted her crop . Every bit of color had drained from her cheeks , but her eyes glowed . Her white lips were parted until her even little teeth were bare to the gums . Ellery was exerting every atom of will to hold himself . He inclined his head , lifted it . " Nancy Beaufort , " he said solemnly , " I ' just could n't help it ! With all my soul I beg your forgiveness ! " Her hauteur was superb , her indignation a grand , tangible thing that to Ellery made her all the more beautiful . " I have heard that gentlemen come from Kentucky , " she said witheringly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are not a gentleman ! " Ellery bowed his head . " Are you going to Columbia , sir ? " " I am , Miss Beaufort . " " Then my father will call upon you there ! " Gatheringthe folds of her habit so that it dropped just above her ankles , she moved quickly to her horse , and though Ellery meant to give her a hand up , she was in the saddle before he could assist . " My father will call upon you , Mister Ellery , " she repeated , " that is if you are gentleman enough not to turn tail and run . " 52 " I am riding to Columbia , " Ellery returned , eyes steady upon her glowing ones , and wanting mightily to smile . I shall look forward to the pleasure of meet- ing your father , Miss Nancy Beaufort . " " It will not be a pleasure ! " she corrected , and reined about and headed down the trail. , llery rubbed a hand across his forehead and felt drops of cold sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of all the damned fools , Jim Ellery , you 're the biggest ! Why in God 's name did you do that , man ? " Still stunned by what he had done , Jim sat down in the trail . It was going to take courage to ride into Columbia , if Nancy Beaufort 's father were like Nancy herself . " Of all times in my worthless life when I should have kept my head , " he muttered savagely . " She 'll never understand ! " She had , been gone half an hour before he mounted . He had not ridden more than a quarter of a mile before hame to a small clearing . At the farther side of the opening was a rude log cabin , and before it stood an old man clad in fringed buckskin , and with a bat- tered coonskin cap partly hiding his long gray hair . There was a smell of frying meat in the air , and with characteristic impetuosity Ellery reined off the trail . AsThe approached he noticed that about all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of gray beard were a high , thin nose and two very blue eyes . There seemed to be a twinkle injhe alert old eyes as Ellery reined up. 531 " Howdy , sir , " he said . " Did I smell venison frying , or did my nose deceive me ? " After a quick look at his visitor , the old man took two steps with the soft bent-knee tread peculiar to the born mountain man , batted his cap to one side , and said : " Do n't ye sir me , ye danged young upstart ! I jest ai n't used to it . I 'm Uncle Sim Knight from Turkey Track Holler back in the Blue Mountings o ' C'liny , and I aim to be ' dressed as sech ! " " Howdy , Uncle Sim , " said Ellery , a slow smile lighting his face . He had seen many men like this one , but not in the California mines , and his heart suddenly warmed . " I 'm Jim Ellery . " " Howdy , Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm right glad to meet ye . Yeah , ye shore smelt deer meat a-cookin ' , and if ye ai n't a mind to rile Uncle Sim Knight , ye 'll ' light and wrap yerself round a sample o ' that thar buck . " 54CHAPTER VThe spot was one of sylvan beauty , and one which such a man as Uncle Sim Knight would have been expected to select as a camp . The grassy glade containedperhaps two acres . Along the gulch maples flamed from dull gold to ? fight crimson , and back against the dark green of the encompassing forest the dogwoods stood out like irregular balls of flaming bronze . At Uncle Sim 's urgent invitation , Ellery unsaddled and picketed his horse with a lariat . He had seen at first glance that the old man was mining in the gulch . " Good diggings ? " he inquired . " Wal , fair , Jim . ' Bout a couple o ' ounces a day , ' nough to keep a old badger like me in grub . I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till I git started or riled up . Then like as not I 'll bet my pile , " gay on a hoss race . That 's a danged fine nag ye got . " " About the finest I ever owned , Uncle Sim . I bought him yesterday . " " Whar ? Come on in . " They entered the cabin , and Uncle Sim turned to his cooking in the rude fireplace . Ellery saw on the floor a big gold-pan half filled with nuggets and fine gold . He laid his heavy saddle-bags beside it. 55 " I bought the horse from Don Cayetano Esqueval at Rancho Linda Vista , " he said . The old man whirled , eyes suddenly narrowed . " This hyar Don Cayenne Pepper a friend o ' yourn ? " " I never saw him until yesterday . " " Wal , " the old man tightened his lips , " I 'm glad o ' that , fer I kind o ' took a likin ' to ye , Jim , fust off , and it 'd shore been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend o ' this hyar greaser . " Ellery 's interest was roused now , by what the old man had left unsaid . He asked him to explain . " Ever hear o ' Juan Moreno , Jim ? " " Who has n't ? " queried Ellery . " He was the worst of the Mexican bandits . " " Not when I fust knowed him ! " Uncle Sim bristled like an angry badger . " No siree , when I fust knowed Juan over in the Chispa Loma hills thar war n't a lovin'er boy in all Californy . It war us ' Mericans what made a hellion outen him , Jim . Somedaymebbe I 'll tell ye the whole story , how Juan got so danged bad I jest had to help trail him down . He war killed by Lee Swinburn over to Sangre de Cristo in the Coast Range . But what I wuz aimin ' at was that this hyar Don Cayenne Pepper used to perteck Juan and his cut-throats . That 's what got most of us ' Mericans down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that if Don Cayetano gave protectionto Mexican bandits , Uncle Sim , he would sort of hobnob with Americans of the same stripe ? " 56 " What ye mean ? " Ellery explained part of what he had seen at Rancho Linda Vista . Uncle Sim waged his hoary head . " Wal , thar 's a old sayin ' as onet a man takes to bad comp'ny , it 's sort o ' nacheral fer him to keep it up . Squar ' yourself round now and try this hyar deer meat and sour-dough bread . I ' low it 's fair , ' special if a fellea 's hungry . " That Uncle Sim Knight was none too tidy did not dampen Ellery 's appetite . In his soiled buckskin , and with his unkempt hair and beard , the old man was somehow remindful of a grizzly bear . Ellery was yet to learn that he was a man given to strange , quick and enduring friendships , in which he would joyfully lay down his life if this became necessary ; or that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known Ellery for years . " Whar ye from in the lust place ? " Uncle Sim demanded , as he folded a piece of meat into a slab of bread and poised it ready for a bite . " My home is in Kentucky . I crossed the plains in ' 49 . " " Wal , by Gawd ! I 'm from C'liny myself , which danged nigh makes us kin . Ye ' n ' me ' re goin ' to be friends , Jim . " " I surely hope so , Uncle Sim . " " Thar ai n't no doubt ' bout it . Hell and molasses , I plumb fergot ! " He hopped from , his stool and dragged a jug from under the bunk , drew the cork with his teeth , and extended the jug. 57 " She 's fair cawn-juice , Jim . She 'll start yer blood runnin ' . " Ellery took a drink , and Uncle Sim took a longer one , after which he chuckled : " Boy , I war weaned on hard likker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me no harm , and thar 's many a time it 'd been powerful hard gittin " long ' thout it . " Then , tilting back his head , he chortled in a cracked old voice : " A scorpeen set on a t'rantler 's back , And chuckled in ghoulish glee , If I do n't sting that pizen son-of-a-gun , He 'll shore be a-stingin ' me ! ' " " That thar 's my fav'ryte song , " announced Uncle Sim . " Allus sing ' er when I feel good luck , and when thar 's a fight in the air . Jim , I 'd ruther fight ' n eat any time , and Uncle Sim Knight from Turkey Track Holler 's shore a old hellion when he gits riled . More'n once I licked my weight in wildcats and clanged fools throwed in . " As suddenly as the hilarious outburst had started , it ceased . Uncle Sim dropped to his stool and took a mouthful of meat and bread . " Ever have a shore ' nough fight , Jim ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few fights . Uncle Sim squinted one eye and appraised him for perhaps a half-minute . " Danged if I do n't b'lieve ye got nerve , " he decreed . 58 " Wal , if ye happen to pair up with me , ye 'll likely git a chance to show it . " It was not a protracted meal , for Ellery had been ravenously hungry , and the old man wasted no time in formality . When it was finished Uncle Sim took anotherstiff drink , and handed Ellery the jug . " Thanks , Uncle Sim , " said the latter . " I never like it after eating . " " Wal , ever ' man to his taste . I like ' er any time , and the more I git inside me the better I feel . ' Sides , I kind o ' got a feelin ' somethin 's goin ' to happen to ye ' n ' me that 'll keep us from cawn likker fer quite a spell . " " Me , too ? " Ellery was amused . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he appreciated the old mountain man 's hospitality . " I said ye , did n't I ? " Uncle Sim bristled . " Do n't ye b'lieve in signs and feelin 's ? Wal , I do , and somethin ' tells me ye and Uncle Sim Knight air goin ' to have a heap o ' work cut out fer ' em . Nope , I cai n't ' splain jest now . As fer signs , we 're goin ' to have a danged early winter , and a hard un . The deer 's been comin ' out o ' the high mountings a month early . The oaks is sheddin ' , and fer two weeks I noticed geese travelin ' south ; but what 's wusser , fer the last three days thar 's been sun-dawgs chasin ' the sun . Sech signs never fail . " Ellery told of his plan to get across the mountains before winter broke . Uncle Sim wagged his head in abrupt negation . " Ye ai n't goin ' ! 59 " But why ? " " Wal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , and in the second place I jest got a feelin ' ye ai n't . " Ellery listened , and wondered a little if old Uncle Sim were gifted with the power of prophecy . Some people were , though it was more probable that Uncle Sim had gained his knowledge of the subject from the superstitions of the darkies in Carolina . The old man tamped his pipe with some natural leaf . Ellery rolled a cigarette . " Uncle Sim , " he asked , " did you see a young lady ride past not long before I arrived ? " " I shore did , and she had that sorrel thorerbred at a run . Wonder what she war in sech a hurry fer . That was Nancy Beaufort . She 's Cunnel Beaufort 's gal , boy . Rides out this way most ever ' day , but ai n't very sociable , not that I blame her much , her bein ' quality and me jest a old C'liny hill-billy . I jest know her by sight and name . " Ellery admitted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She appeared very beautiful , Uncle Sim . " " Purtier'n a yearlin ' doe in summer hair , " agreed the old man . " And she shore looks like she 'd be sweeter'n wild-bee honey . " In reply to a question from Ellery , Uncle Sim explainedthat Colonel Beaufort had been a planterlawyerin Tennessee before coming west . Report had it that he was a man of more than ample means and that his residence in the mines was merely the satisfaction of a desire for the adventurous and picturesque. 60Besides holding rich claims near Columbia , Beaufort had a law office in Sonora , and owned a substantial interest in the Milner bank at Columbia , which was making money hand-over-fist buying gold from the miners . " I hear the gal 's all he 's got , " Uncle Sim added . " She goes ever'whar with the cunnel . They tell me they 're as much to home in San Francisco and Sac'ementoas they are at the Columbia House . Miss Nancy , she 's quite a belle down in San Francisco . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pretty , indignant face . " And the cunnel shore is a man fer race hosses . Jim , if he sets eyes on that thar yaller hoss o ' yourn he 'll likely make ye a fine offer fer him . " " He ca n't have him , " Ellery declared . " I 'm going to ride that horse back to Kentucky . " " By Gawd , ye 're not ! Why do n't ye stay right hyar with me on this hyar claim this winter ? Thar 's plenty o ' gold fer two , and ' sides , what do I care fer gold ? " Uncle Sim made an indifferent gesture toward the pan of it on the floor . Indeed he did not care for gold except in the satisfaction of his simple tastes . The getting of it afforded him the adventure his old soul craved . Strangely , in this land of lavish gold there was much suffering , the suffering of failures and incompetents , and Uncle Sim Knight took more pleasure in giving a sack of golddustto some poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct , training had made the old man a 61woodsman and mountaineer . When the news of the gold discovery in California had reached the Cumberlandshe had set out , across the South , across the unexploredSouthwest , braving Comanches and Apaches , out along the arid Gila Trail , across the Colorado , the Tehachipi , and up the San Joaquin to the mines . Here he was in his element . The gulches and flats gave him so much gold that he had to scatter the surplus with a lavish hand . He mined perhaps a fourth of his time . A fourth he spent in the towns . The remaining half he devoted to hunting , for to him there was a far greater thrill in killing a big grizzly , stalking a puma , or bringing down a cunning old buck than in finding ten-thousand-dollar nuggets . They went outside and sat on a log . The sky was still leaden , and the variant puffs of wind through the woods sent leaves of oak and maple and dogwood tumbling in swift color against the dark background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shore a-goin ' to storm . Snow afore tomorrernight , or I 'll eat my moccasins . I never yit seen them sun-dawgs fail . No siree ! " Suddenly from the timbered trail came the pound of hoofs . A man on a mule swept into sight and reined into the clearing . With a mighty " whoa " he pulled the puffing animal to a stop . He was a gawky young fellow with a lantern jaw which worked excitedly on a cud of tobacco . " Howdy , Johnny , " said Uncle Sim . " What 's all the rush ? Most usual ye and that than myule ai n't in sech a danged big hurry . " 62 ' Johnny 's jaws worked faster . His mouth opened , closed , opened . His protruding eyes were wild . " Hu-hu-hu " he stammered , glancing back toward the trail . " Hu-hell 's turned loose in town ! The M-Milner bank 's been robbed and two men shot ! " In a panther-like spring , entirely unlooked for in a man of his years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the mule and demanded that he give a sensibleexplanation . Meanwhile Ellery was on his feet , listening alertly . Uncle Sim 's eyes glowed triumphantly as they turned upon Ellery . " Thar ! I told ye somethin ' war a-goin ' to happen , Jim ! This hyar country 's been too danged peaceable . I told ye ye ' n ' me 'd have somethin ' to do . " " But I do n't understand , Uncle Sim , " said Ellery . " I do n't see what I can do . " To the great astonishment of Johnny , who by nature feared violence , Uncle Sim laid one hand upon his knife , the other upon his revolver . He leaned forward and glared at Ellery . " Ye do n't ? Wal , Jim , ye ' n ' me 's goin ' to ketch them robbers . Cunnel Beaufort 's a Tennessee man . Ye 're from Kaintucky , and I 'm a old C'liny hill-billy . If that thar do n't make us ree-lated , jest tell me what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ellery smiled whimsically to hide the thrill that was beginning to race through him . " I think I 'll go along , Uncle Sim . It 's going to be too late for me to get across the mountains . " 63CHAPTER VIAfter Johnny Walker had had a drink of Uncle Sim 's " cawn-juice " he was able to give a more coherent story of the robbery as he had seen it . Four horsemen had dashed into town , two from each direction , their revolvers driving most of the men off the streets . Then while two had stood guard outside , the other two had entered the bank . Two men had been shot , and it was reported that the bandits had headed up the Woods Creek trail toward the higher levels . " It was all over quicker'n a wink , " said Johnny . " But to me it seemed to take more'n an hour . " " I ' low mebbe ye war skeered , Johnny , " Uncle Sim ventured . " There was n't any maybe business about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , and I ducked in ' tween two houses and just lay there till them bandits had rid off toward the hills . " " Was n't there any shooting as they went ? " asked Ellery . " Plenty , but it was too late . Them robbers was gone like the wind . They had the best hosses I ever seen . " At Ellery 's request the youth described the horses as best he could . The one that had impressed him 64most had been a fine bay ridden by a tall , redmustachedman who seemed to be the bandit leader . The red-headed man and a stocky fellow with a black beard had been the two who had entered the bank and emerged with the two sacks of loot . " They 're the same ones , Uncle Sim , " declared Ellery . Johnny turned quickly to Ellery . " Then you know ' em , mister ? " " I do n't know them , but I may have heard of them , " replied Ellery . He glanced at Uncle Sim . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if I wuz ye I 'd jest ride on over to yer diggin 's and tell yer pappy ' bout this danged hold-up ; and sort o ' suggest to him ye 'd better stay holed-up fer a spell . Thar 's no tellin ' how long them danged robbers 'll run loose in these hyar hills . And recollect , they 're plenty bad . " " You 're right they 're bad , Uncle Sim ! Did n't I see it all ? Did n't I see ' em leave two dead men in the street , and git away with Lord knows how much money ? Yeah , I 'll tell Pap what you say , Uncle Sim . " Johnny clambered onto the mule , flogged the animal with a switch , and galloped away into the forest . " The boy 's still a little upset , " said Ellery with a grin . " Jest a leetle case o ' buck agger , " agreed Uncle Sim . " Now ye set down hyar and tell me just how them fellers at Rancho Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smell a polecat . Couple o ' weeks ago I was trackin ' a old grizzly back yander in the timber when all to once I come to somethin ' that at65the time strikes me as a leetle onusual . Now she seems to be couplin ' up to somethin ' else . " Ellery accurately described the three men he had met at Rancho Linda Vista . Uncle Sim cocked his head and listened , occasionallyinterrupting with a grunt . Half his thoughts were back in the forest that stretched to the summitsof the Sierras . No man had explored that sea of timber and brush as had he . From the Clavia , far to south , he knew it , to the Dardanelles , those majestic lava ramparts and citadels at the head of the Stanislaus ; back to the summit where the timber was sparse and stunted , and from where a man might gaze out across the high sage desert to the distant mountains of Nevada .

Why did n't ye shoot ' em thar at Don Cayenne Pepper'swhile ye had the chance ? " " They were three to one , Uncle Sim , and I was n't quite sure . " " Wal , mebbe ye 're right , but the next time ye see snakes as look like rattlers jest kill ' em and look fer their rattles afterwards . Most any sort o ' snake needs killin ' . " Ellery was still in the dark as to what the old man intended to do , but his face lighted as Uncle Sim explained . " Air ye with me , Jim ? " " I sure am , Uncle Sim ! " 66Reaching for the jug , Uncle Sim took another pull at it . The next moment he was giving orders , putting things about the cabin into shape for a long absence . The pan of gold and Ellery 's saddle-bags were buried in a shallow hole under the bunk . Uncle Sim gathered a little food in a sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowie on a stone . " This hyar old toad-sticker , " he said fondly as he squinted at Ellery , " has more'n once got me outen a tight pinch . " Uncle Sim took up his heavy Hawkin rifle , examined it , and set it against the wall . He dropped a handful of bullets for the weapon into one pocket and a handful of balls for his revolver into another , slung his powder-horn over a shoulder , set his moth-eaten coonskin cap more firmly on his hoary head . MeanwhileEllery had about completed his own preparations . " I ai n't much of a man with a pistol , " Uncle Sim admitted , " but I 'm hell and all with a bowie or a rifle-gun . More'n once I 've carved my way outen hell with this hyar old toad-sticker , and when it comes to old Betsy , " he glanced affectionately at the heavy rifle , " I kin shoot the eye outen a gnat and never disfigger him a-tall no other place . " With his swift , bent-knee gait the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his nondescriptsorrel mare which he profanely addressed as Molly . " Dang ye , Molly , " he adjured as he cinched the saddle , " ye 're likely to have to eat snow ' stead o ' 671grass afore we git back . Let out yer breath , ye contraryfemale ! " Ellery had saddled his horse and tied a light pack back of the cantle . He looked at the old man , who now seemed even more primitive , more formidable . Uncle Sim picked up the jug , took a long pull at it . " Likely it 'll be quite a spell afore we git any more likker , " he announced as he passed the jug to Ellery . " So I figger I mought as well start primed . " Ellery touched his lips to the jug and handed it to the old man , who tossed it into the cabin and shut the door . " Uncle Sim , " Ellery said seriously , " I 've been thinking about Miss Beaufort , and I 'm worried about her . She may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she did " " That thar sorrel she rides 'd show his heels to any hoss any danged robber ever rid , " finished Uncle Sim . " Climb yer saddle , Jim . It 's gittin ' late . " The calamitous entry and swift departure of the bandits left the town in a turmoil of excitement . Men tumbled from buildings , from between buildings , from all the places into which they had dodged when the shooting desperadoes had come into the main street from both directions . The robbery had been committed so quickly that the inhabitants two blocks from the main street did not know of it until the news was scattered by excited men . The town was without a leader until Marshal Tom Slavin arrived . He immediately dispatched a mes-68senger to Sonora , the county seat , to notify the sheriff . Posses were formed . They spread along the trail of the fleeing robbers without waiting for the sheriff . Slavin led one of these posses straight up the Woods Creek trail . The bandits had split after fleeing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hills at the northerly side of the creek , the other two to the timbered slopes at the southerly side . Each pair had soon split , thus resulting in a total lack of well marked trail . To have followed the main trail would have exposed the bandits to view of scores of miners sluicing along upper Woods Creek . The result of their strategy was that when Marshal Slavin led his mounted posse up the creek and encountered the first of the miners , they showed surprise and consternation , and told him that no mounted men had passed that way . Slavin sent part of his posse to northward , while he himself led the other part toward the southerly slopes . They found nothing , for the bandit horses left small tracks in the dry grass and amid the pine needles which thickly carpeted the forest . To render the pursuit even more futile , all the posse , including Slavin , believed that because of the threatening storm the robbers would not press into the higher reaches , but would swerve to right or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back toward the valley . Within an hour after the robbery fully two hundred men , in twos and threes and in scores , were searching the hills , fanning out until before dark some of them69were at the Stanislaus trying to find out where the bandits had crossed . Others had circled into the hills back of Sonora , while still others were combing the chaparral-covered slopes and ridges to westward , in the direction opposite to that the bandits had taken . Uncle Sim Knight refused to explain his purpose , except to declare that if Ellery followed him he would see " plenty of fireworks . " Ellery decided to follow and ask no questions . Into his mind was coming a vast respect for the old mountain man who could drink a quart of whiskey and show no effect except a keener twinkle in his blue eyes . One thing , however , tugged at Ellery 's determination , and urged him to go back . He wanted to ride into Columbia , find Nancy Beaufort , tell her something . He did not want to apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the realization that they would think him a cur and a coward when he did not appear was like gall in his mouth . " She 'll think I 've tucked my tail between my legs and run like a mangy dog , " he told himself . Uncle Sim , on his nondescript sorrel , led the way , not as fast as Ellery would have liked , but at a ploddinggait . The old man looked as much a part of the forest as would have a grizzly . His rifle was across the saddle , his coonskin cap down to his ears , his neck drawn in to meet his hunching shoulders . Uncle Sim Knight was wise in the ways of woods and mountains . The lay of a vast stretch of timber , the slope of a ridge , the course of a canyon , the moss70upon the gnarled trunks of the black-oaks , dim marks on the needle-carpeted earth , all told him their stories . Onward , upward the horses climbed , through magnificentforest , yellow and sugar pines as straight as arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . As they climbed , the black-oaks became fewer and the pines and firs grew more thickly . In the canyons were dense thickets of mountain-lilac and manzanita . About the time Sheriff Sam Warren galloped into Columbia with Colonel Beaufort , who had been at his office in the county seat , Uncle Sim reined up on an open slope which commanded a view of the region below , and of the great valley stretching dark under the leaden sky . Rain was falling in slight , intermittentshowers . Far toward the cloud-shrouded summits snow-squalls trailed across the black forest and night was dropping fast . Sheriff Warren had left orders with Bill Yerkes , his deputy , to recruit a posse and follow . With Colonel Beaufort he went immediately to the bank , where from David Milner they learned first-hand of the robbery , and the actual extent of the loss . The bandits had taken thirty thousand dollars in coin , and had contemptuously ignored as much gold-dust . " Have you any idea who these robbers may be , Sheriff ? " Milner demanded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray eyes . " It looks like the work of an organized gang , Milner , " returned the sheriff . " There 's been none in this71part of the country since the breakin ' up of the Juan Moreno outfit . I have heard though , that there 's been some suspicious characters hangin ' round Rancho Linda Vista for the past few weeks . " Colonel Beaufort was tall , straight , handsome , every inch an aristocrat of the old South . Whether on horseback , in his office or on the street mingling with redshirtedminers , he was always faultlessly garbed in black broadcloth and gray beaver . Now he stroked his silvery imperial , and his blue eyes lighted . " By gad ! " he declared . " That 's an idea. , Sheriff . Those men who have been hanging around Rancho Linda Vista may be at the bottom of this nefarious business , though I hate to think Don Cayetano Esqueval would consort with such villains . From what I have seen of him he is a fine old gentleman . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danged well , " retorted Warren . " Us old timers know Cayetanoprotected Juan Moreno all through his damnable career , and that was the worst reign of terror any country ever passed through . I do n't trust no Mexicansince then , and I do n't give a damn whether he 's hidalgo or peon . " " Then you 'll investigate affairs at Rancho Linda Vista , Sheriff ? " suggested the sagacious Milner . " We shall offer five thousand dollars reward for the capture and conviction of these robbers . " In a few minutes the three men went out to the street . They were soon surrounded by an excited crowd , eager to question and offer advice . " As soon as Bill Yerkes comes I 'll have him take 72a posse and ride for Rancho Linda Vista , " said the sheriff . " I 'll take some men and pick up the trail . " It was twilight when Colonel Beaufort crossed the dusty street to the Columbia House , where he and his daughter made their home . He glanced about expectantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted him cordially . After returning their greetings with his customary politeness the colonel turned to the man at the desk . " William , has Miss Nancy come in ? She took her usual ride , I reckon ? " " Why , yes , Colonel , " replied the clerk . " Miss Nancy rode away shortly after noon , but I have n't seen her come back , now that I think of it . Everything 's been upset since the hold-up , you see . " The lines about the ends of the colonel 's mouth tightened , and something like fright flashed into his eyes . " Which way did Miss Nancy go , William ? " " She said she was riding up the Woods Creek trail , Colonel . I was talking with her just before she left . " After her rides Nancy sometimes ascended to her rooms by the back stairs . To relieve his mind the clerk ran upstairs . When he returned he looked worried . " She 's not in the rooms , Colonel , " he announced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For a few moments the handsome old colonel stood like a man suddenly stricken with a dire and incurable malady . His face twitched . He seemed to age a decade . His love for his daughter was an all-consum-73ing passion , greater by far than his pride , his love of fair play and his belief in all the traditions of the South . At last he regained his voice . " Thank you , William , " he said unsteadily . " I shall walk around to the livery stable and see if Miss Nancy 's horse is there . She may be calling upon one of the sick women to whom she is so devoted . " Hope made the colonel 's step brisker as he went to the stable , but when he was told by the hostler that his daughter had not come in , his shoulders sagged . He trudged slowly back to the hotel , meanwhile scanning the street in the hope of catching sight of the slim , beautiful girl who was to him more than life itself . " She ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , by gad , Nancy 's too fine a horsewoman for that . " He braced his shoulders and some of the old resiliency came into his step . " She 's just out looking after some sick lady , stopped on her way to the stable . I sha n't worry . " 74CHAPTER VIIThe tall pines bent and swayed in the wind . Small dry branches fell . The air was filled with flying twigs and pine needles . It was as if the forest were instinctivelydivesting itself of everything superfluous in order that it might bear up under the weight of snow to come upon it . Ellery was thinking of his horse . This would be a night on which the animal would have no feed , from present indications . Uncle , Sim , with eyes squinted and ears alert , was thinking more of the elements . " She 's goin ' to be a gen-ooine old southeaster , " he declared , " and when a winter out hyar opens that away she 's shore to be a hard un , Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudbanks , like a gray-black cap drawn down over a long black brow . The great valley far below was blurred through the rain squalls . A few vagrant snowflakes tumbled down , disappeared into nothing when they settled on the needle-carpeted earth . To eastward snow squalls trailed across the black forest . After reconnoitering to right and left to pick up any sign of the bandits , Uncle Sim and Ellery crossed the slope and presently halted in a low gap in the ridge . Through the gap was passing an almost continuous75procession of deer  --  does , yearlings , fawns that had lost their spots , great-antlered , blue-gray bucks , their horns back , their noses pointed instinctively toward the lower country . Uncle Sim watched the flight , occasionally calling Ellery 's attention to the points of some buck that loomed large in contrast with the others of the herd . The deer seemed to be possessed of but a single purpose , and for the time their instinctive fear of man was forgotten in their determination to gain the low ranges ahead of the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ye do n't b'lieve in sundawgsand other weather sign , this hyar orter tell ye that winter 's right onto us . Lordy , but ai n't that old mosshead yander a jimdandy ? Jim , the fat on that old feller 's rump is two inches thick , or I 'll eat this hyar danged coonskin cap ! " Instructing Ellery to ride southward a short distance and keep a close watch for horse tracks , Uncle Sim dismounted , and leading his horse , started in the other direction . Ellery had not traveled a hundred yards up the slope of the notch before he came upon the fresh tracks of not one horse but of three . He swung down and bent over the tracks , examining them with a care and knowledge gained by years on the edge of things . Suddenly his heart made a wild leap , then seemed to cease beating . He pressed his hands against his breast and for a half-minute stood staring down at the tracks . With a bound he was in his saddle and headed back across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the opposite crest. 76 " Hyar 's a couple o ' fresh hoss tracks , " announced the old man . " It 's jest as I figgered . " " Yes , yes , " Ellery panted . " Come with me , Uncle Sim . I 've found something . Hurry ! It 'll soon be dark . " Bill Yerkes swung into the main street from the Sonora road at the head of six armed men as Colonel Beaufort rounded the corner of the hotel . Recogniz- ing the colonel , the deputy reined up . " Where 's Warren ? " Before Colonel Beaufort could answer , the sheriff came hurrying across the street . There was a short consultation , at the end of which Yerkes took three of his men and rode for Rancho Linda Vista . The sheriff had by now recruited a dozen dependable men , and was on the point of calling them together into a posse when Colonel Beaufort said : " Sam , I 'm worried about my daughter , Nancy . She went for a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not returned . " " What hoss was she ridin ' , Colonel ? " demanded Warren . " Nancy always rides Tennessee , Sam . " The sheriff 's weathered face puckered thought- fully . " I do n't see as how the robbers would want to harm Miss Nancy , Colonel , but they might want that hoss . Tennessee 's worth a small fortune . " Colonel Beaufort 's anxiety had been for his daugh- ter . The sheriff 's suggestion gave him hope. 771 " Do you think that they might have taken Tennesseeand set Nancy afoot ? " he demanded in an anxious voice . " That 's the way it looks to me , Colonel ; that is if anything has happened to Miss Nancy . It do n't look reasonable that robbers 'd want to be hampered by a girl , but they might want a fine hoss . " While Colonel Beaufort 's fears were lessened , they were not dispelled . He hurried into the hotel in the hope that Nancy had returned . When the colonel descended from his rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave and gray and the hand of age seemed to have dropped upon his shoulders . " Damn it , William , " he said to the clerk , " something'shappened to my girl ! Miss Nancy has never been known to stay out so late . " " She may have fallen from her horse , or the horse got hurt somehow . We 'll hear from her before long , that is if she do n't show up . Go into the bar and take a drink , Colonel . It 'll brace you up . " The colonel went into the bar and took a stiff glass of Bourbon , but the liquor seemed for once to have no relish , no stimulant . He glanced out to the darkeningstreet , where rain was falling in gusty showers and stippling the dust of a long , dry summer . Posses and remnants of posses were straggling back with the approach of night , and reporting to the sheriff . They had found nothing , though some of the men had penetrated as far as the Stanislaus . Sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the78Columbia . House , stared away toward the darkening , cloud-wrapped summits , and shook his head . " There ai n't much use tryin ' to pick up the trail before mornin ' , " he declared , " and in the mornin ' there wo n't be any trail . It looks to me like these robbers must have known this storm was due and timed their raid to meet it . There ai n't one chance in a million they 'll head for the mountains . We 'll have to comb north and south and down into the valley . " Everybody agreed with the sheriff that any thought of the robbers trying to get across the range was foolish and childish . " Why clang it , even the deer are comin ' out in droves , " declared a bearded mountaineer who had returnedfrom the upper country only the day before . " I seen ' em , boys . " " And if you do n't believe in deer signs , look back yonder for yourself , " added a miner . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's already a foot on the summit , three feet by to-morrow . " The sheriff had already decided to remain in town for the night to keep charge of the situation , and take up the pursuit in the morning . However , he dispatchedmessengers north and south to notify other officers of the robbery and give them the best possible description of the bandits . The town had by now added five thousand dollars to the reward offered by the bank . The excitement grew as more and more men returned from the fruitless search . The saloons were filled , and in them , in the dance-halls , in the restau-79rants , everywhere , the talk was of the robbery . Groups of men congregated in the streets , despite the rain that was now falling steadily . Time and again Colonel Beaufort went up to his rooms in the hope that Nancy had ascended by the rear stairway , but each time he came down he was a. little grimmer . A dozen times he went to the livery stable . He made personal visits to homes where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , but all in vain . By the time darkness had settled over the town and yellow lights shone from the windows of saloons , dance-halls , stores , Colonel Beaufort was on the point of collapse . He had pictured a dozen terrible fates for Nancy , visualized her broken , helpless in the raindrenchedforest ; seen her the prey of the bandits ; caught a glimpse of her dead , white face turned up to the storm . By this time the town had learned of the girl 's failure to return , and this added twofold to the excitement . All Columbia loved the genial old Southerngentleman as it loved his charming daughter . The distracted colonel went from group to group , from saloon to saloon in the hope of catching some stray bit of news that would tell him his daughter was safe . A miner in the " Long Tom " saloon said that he had seen the girl as she rode up the creek . " But you did n't see Miss Nancy return , suh ? " demanded the colonel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diggin 's sort of establishes the direction she took . " 80A half-dozen other miners who had come in from their claims told of seeing the girl as she was riding away from town , but not a man had seen her coming back . The colonel met , Milner as the banker was starting up to his room . " By gad , David ! " he groaned . " Something has happened to my girl ! " Milner pursed his thin lips . " Do n't worry , Colonel , " he counselled . " Nothing has happened to your daughter . Is n't it possible that she may have decided to ride to Sonora to visit Miss Betty Fraser ? They are close friends , are n't they ? " " By Jove , that 's right , suh ! " declared the colonel . Forthwith he dispatched a messenger to Sonora on the fleetest horse that Smith , the liveryman , had left . An hour and a half later the messenger galloped back , to tell that Miss Fraser had seen nothing of the colonel'smissing daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he found in the center of a group in the " Pay Dirt " saloon . " I beg your pardon , suh , " he said in a voice that trembled with anguish and emotion as he touched the sheriff on an arm . " There is no news of Miss Nancy . I will give five thousand dollars for her return , Sam . Yes , by gad , ten thousand ! " It was not Colonel Beaufort 's offer of the reward that sent scores of men on this new search . It was the anguish of his fine old face , and the town 's love for his pretty daughter . There was not a man in allS1the famed diggings who would not have laid down his life to save Nancy Beaufort 's . Even the Mexicans loved her , for she had been kind to them when most of the Americans had been callous , often brutal . Lanterns , torches were brought , and before morning every cabin , every trail , every gulley and slope within a radius of five miles was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted only long enough to allow Ellery and Uncle Sim to gallop across the depression , and resumed its steady trot . Ellery flung himself from the saddle near where he had discovered the horse tracks . Uncle Sim was mildly excited as he clambered off the little sorrel mare . " Look here , Uncle Sim , " Ellery commanded as he bent over a clean track . " What do you make of that ? " " It 's a hoss track , a ' right , " grunted the old man , " but it 's some different from most . Looks like a race hoss shoe , Jim . " " That 's the track of the horse Nancy Beaufort was riding ! " " Naw ? Ye do n't mean that ? " Something incredulous , then hard gleamed in Uncle Sim 's eyes . " Jim , that jest cai n't be so . " Ellery now explained how he had met Nancy Beauforton the trail and how he had removed the stone from the shoe , but he did not think it necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kissed her. 82 " Uncle Sim , I 'd know that shoe anywhere on earth . I examined it closely because the instant I saw it I knew it was the shoe of a race horse . It 's a handforgedshoe , and the nails are hand-forged . Ca n't you see the hammer marks ? " " Wal , by Gawd ! " muttered Uncle Sim . He bent more closely now , and made out the tiny irregularities in the track to which Ellery called his attention . " They must ' a ' run acrost Miss Nancy , and stole her hoss ! " " Stolen her horse ! " Ellery ejaculated . " Uncle Sim , I 'm afraid they 've kidnaped her , too ! " Uncle Sim apparently did not hear , for he was on his feet , and walking slowly as he scrutinized the tracks . All his instincts were now those of the born mountain man , to whom tiny signs tell great stories , yet as he tramped slowly ahead he could not , for the life of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse . " One thing 's certain , " he finally announced . " That race hoss was bein ' led . Ye kin see fer yerself how he follers right behind t' other . T' other un is offsideyander . " Ellery was now seized with a sudden fear that because of his meeting with the girl he had thrown her into the hands of the bandits . " Uncle Sim , " he demanded , " do you think they 've got her ? " The old man tilted his head and peered up to where the storm wind was soughing through the top branches of a tall pine. 83 " This hyar 's goin ' to be a reg'lar old southeaster , Jim . " " Answer my question , Uncle Sim ! " " Jest keep yer shirt on , young un , " advised the old man . " I 'm a feller what kin think o ' one thing and talk ' bout ' nother . I 'm ' clined to think they ai n't got Miss Nancy , Jim , ' cause I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hampered with a gal fer , ' special on a trip like this hyar and in sech weather . She 's shore goin ' to snow gray geese , and plumb pronto . " With a lowering and thickening of the clouds the night dropped with uncanny swiftness . Gusts of wind brought a few desultory snowflakes , and soon the darkening air was gray with them . The migratingdeer quickened their pace , while along their flanks sleek , tawny pumas stalked , eager to make their kills when blackness had come and the deer had bedded down till morning . " Thar ai n't no use o ' us tryin ' to go futher tonight , " announced Uncle Sim . " But we must , we 've just got to , Uncle Sim ! They may have the girl ! " Uncle Sim cocked his head and regarded Ellery coolly . He emptied his mouth of a big cud of tobacco . " Wal by Gawd , if ye want to keep goin ' , jest keep on , " he announced . " Uncle Sim Knight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to camp . Ye drat dasted young fool , inside a hour these hyar woods 'll be darker'n a stack o ' black cats with all the niggers o ' C'liny throwed in , and the best man on earth 'd git lost . Thar ai n't no trails . I 'm a-goin ' to84find me a place to curl up till mornin ' . Jest keep a-goin ' if ye like , though . " Impatient , angry , Ellery stalked to and fro . Never in all his life had he wanted to do anything as he now wanted to press forward on the trail . Suddenly he stopped and peered at the old man with doubt and fear on his face . " Uncle Sim , do you suppose they might have killed Miss Nancy and then taken her horse ? " he demanded . " She may even now be lying dead , somewhere back in the woods . Let 's take the back trail ! " Uncle Sim pondered this , while about them the storm winds howled and sighed and the pines divested themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye say might be true , Jim , " he said slowly , shaking his head . " Them fellers ai n't men to treat a gal with respeck , and she may be daid , but ' twould n't do us no good to take the back trail , ' less we had cat 's eyes . ' Sides , when old Uncle Sim Knight sets out to do a , sartain thing , he 's shore sot on doin ' it till it 's done one way or t' other . Come on , we got to find a place to hole-up in . " Ellery did not mount the tired thoroughbred again , but leading the animal , he trudged after the old man on the sorrel mare . His heart was heavy with the certainty that Nancy Beaufort lay dead somewhere back in the darkening forest , or was in the ruthless hands of the bandits ; and that at least for the time he was powerless to aid her. 85CHAPTER VIIIThe forest was spectral now , but with instinct as unerring as that of the deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tumbled off the mare and began gathering fuel . Ellery dragged the saddle from his weary horse , then unsaddled the mare . By this time Uncle Sim had a fire going , and as the blaze leaped up it shone upon flaming-leafed maples and dogwoods against the background of tall conifers and spreading black-oaks . Snow was falling slowly . " We 'll jest camp hyar till mornin ' , " said Uncle Sim as he spitted a slice of venison on the end of a green stick . " Thar ai n't no use traipsin ' on . Kind o ' seems good to see it snow . " There was no beauty for Ellery in the flying flakes . He was thinking of Nancy Beaufort . " Uncle Sim , " he demanded , " do you know where we 're going ? " Coffee was simmering in a tin can . Uncle Sim stirred it with a stick . " Wal now , do ye ' low them deer back thar know whar they 're goin ' , Jim ? Git some grub inside ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died now , and snow fell continuously , in big fleecy flakes that floated out of the blackness86like white feathers . Uncle Sim looked up at the heavens . " The old woman 's shore pickin ' some big geese tonight , Jim . " " It 's going to be a hard night on the horses , " said Ellery . Slowly , implacably , as if the black sky were a bottomlessreservoir , the flakes fell . When the horses ceased trying to get the dry grass , Ellery tied them in the shelter of a thicket and came back to the fire . Uncle Sim found a , log , and soon had a long fire burninga short distance from it . Between the fire and the log the scant camp equipment was placed . The men spread their saddle blankets over them and pillowed their heads on their saddles , . Out in the blackness a puma screamed . The sound made Ellery 's blood turn cold . It was a half-feline , half-human cry . " Good God , Uncle Sim , " he groaned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Wal , if she is thar ai n't nothin ' us two kin do to help her , Jim . If she 's not she 's either safe back in Columbia , or with them robbers . " The old Carolina man had a faculty of sleeping " with one eye open , " as he put it . At intervals he awoke to look at the fire , but each time saw that Ellery had attended to it . Ellery , unable to sleep , had kept a track clear by pacing to and fro . His coat was wrapped tightly . His face was grim . " Why do n't ye try to git some sleep , boy ? " Uncle Sim demanded . " Worry never did git a feller nothin ' . " 87 " I ca n't , Uncle Sim . I 've tried a dozen times . " Dawn began to break at last , cold , miserable , gray , but no grayer than Ellery 's thoughts . Uncle Sim rose as though he had slept all night on a feather bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers through his whiskers . " Wal now , that war n't a bad night . I 've had many a worse un , Jim . " Snow lay a foot deep on the level . The forest was weighted with it . It was a white world except for the dark splotches under the pines and firs . Branches now and then emptied themselves of their white loads . Ellery was impatient to be off , but Uncle Sim insisted on preparing and eating their breakfast with provoking slowness . " Thar ai n't no use gittin ' up a sweat , " he declared . " Thar ai n't nothin ' to be gained by hurryin ' , Jim . If harm 's been done that gal it 's been done , and if it ai n't thar ai n't no use rushin ' . Did ye ever see a panther stalkin ' a deer ? " Ellery had compared Uncle Sim with a gray old grizzly . Now he thought he saw something pantherish in the old man , slow , unperturbed , calculating , yet ready to strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his rifle and revolver did not get wet . At his order Ellery led the horses from the thicket . The backs of the animals were hunched and their hair seemed to have grown a half-inch during the night . Ellery 's heart filled with pity for Real , who seemed so entirely out of place here in the snow-laden forest. 88 " Boy , " he said as he stroked the fine head , " this is certainly no place for you . " " Thar 's more places ' n a race track to try out a thorerbred on , " remarked Uncle Sim . " Jim , I 'm jest beginnin ' to wonder whether ye 're a thorerbred or jest a common plug . " Ellery 's wide shoulders went back as he regarded the old man . He swore under his breath that he would not be outdone by any such grizzled runt of a mountainman as this one . " Uncle Sim , " he declared hotly , " I 'm with you till the end . I take your orders now simply because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Instead of leading on , Uncle Sim finished cinching his saddle . Then he sat down on a log . " I done a heap o ' thinkin ' in the night , " he said , " and I done come to the ' elusion the gal 's all right as fer as bein ' alive is , Jim . " " Yes , Uncle Sim ? " " Ye see Cunnel Beaufort 's a powerful rich man , and ' cause o ' this thar may be a reason them robbers 'd take the gal , ' long with her hoss . Air ye danged shore o ' that hoss track , Jim ? " " I 'd swear on my life it was made by Nancy Beaufort'shorse ! Uncle Sim , do you think they have kidnaped her ? " " Call it what ye like , kidnaped , took , or jest plain stole . If she 's been took I figger thar wo n't any harm come to her fer at least a while . That 'll give us time . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " Ellery said . " After that I ca n't promise anything . " " And if we do come up with ' em , " warned Uncle Sim , his eyes gleaming angrily , " do n't ye git too danged rash . Thar 's only two things what orter be in a hurry . One 's a bullet , t'other 's a knife . When either one o ' them starts to travel they got to travel fast . Now hyar 's one thing I want to warn ye ' bout , Jim . " Ellery waited , impatient to be off , but with a growingconfidence in the old man . " It 's clanged likely thar 'll be other men after these hyar robbers and the gal , Jim , " explained Uncle Sim . " Now if we happen to run acrost any o ' ' em , I want ye to promise ye wo n't tell ' em nothin ' a-tall . Will ye gim me yer word ? " Ellery thought this a foolish idea , and searched the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we 've more chance of success alone , Uncle Sim ? " " Drat dang yer hide , boy , if I did n't I would n't ' vise it ! Ye heerd the sayin ' that too many cooks spoil the broth ? Wal , too many men on a trail 's apt to mess that thar trail up . ' Sides , this hyar ai n't a country fer a passel o ' howlin ' hounds . Will ye promise ? " " I give you my word , Uncle Sim . " Dawn had disclosed that camp had been made inthe bottom of a horseshoe-shaped cove . To north rosea timbered dome . To south a tall ridge curved around . " I 'm goin ' to ride up to that thar sugar-loaf and90have a look round , " said Uncle Sim , pointing to the dome . " I know this hyar country like a book in summer , but snow makes a difference . If ye do n't want to wait , jest take a run up yon ridge and see what 's on t' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hour . " Uncle Sim rode away , avoiding with almost uncanny skill the snow-laden branches . He was hunched in his saddle . His sinewy neck was drawn down until it seemed he had no neck at all . The tail of his buckskin shirt carefully covered the nipple of his heavy Hawkin rifle . Eager to be doing something , Ellery swung into the saddle and headed in the opposite direction . He gained the crest of the ridge and reined up . Below him was where the head of a long canyon , running southward , ended in a wide swale . Beyond the swale was a higher ridge , and beyond this the white landscapestretched away till it merged with the leaden clouds banked low on the summits . Ellery decided to pick his way through the timber and brush , and gain the higher ridge for a wider view . He was half-way down the slope to the swale when Real thrust his ears forward and whistled softly through his nostrils . Ellery reined him in and reached for one of his Colts . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caught the tang of wood smoke . He looked ahead for the source of the smoke , convinced that he had stumbled upon the bandit camp , and was debating whether to attack alone or slip back for Uncle Sim when the branches of a fir thicket parted at his91left and a man stepped into view . The man had a rifle at his shoulder . " Hands up ! " he growled . " Or I 'll put a slug through you . " A swift glance at the bearded face , the cold eyes back of the rifle , and Ellery 's hands shot into the air . " Hyar , boys ! " shouted the man without lowering the gun . " I got one ! Come on ! " Forty yards away was a dense thicket of small firs . In a moment a man appeared from it , then another and another . They started toward Ellery , each graspinga rifle . Other men were by this time emerging from the thicket . The rain that descended upon Columbia that night was interspersed with flurries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fell . It was a desolate night , but not one one-hundredth as desolate as the soul of Colonel Beaufort . Throughout the interminable hours the colonel waited in the hotel , or paced the streets , or went into the saloons , hoping for some word . Each place he visited , each man or group of men he met had only disappointment and sympathy for him . All through the night men straggled in from the fruitless search , bringing with them not one faint ray of hope . In the cold dawn he stood in front of the hotel and looked toward the snowy mountains and the lowdrawncloud caps . David Milner stood beside him . The banker had been up all night , for he , too , loved92Nancy Beaufort , and his worry was second only to that of her father . " Colonel , " said Milner , " the more I think about it , the more I think it 's absurd for us to think Miss Nancy met with an accident . She 's too fine a horse-woman . " " Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied the colonel . " Something dire has befallen her . I feel it here , David , " he pressed a hand to his breast . He was gaunt , haggard . " I would give all the money I own , all I hope to own , and all my interest in heaven if I only knew she was safe ! " Eight men quickly surrounded Ellery . They all carried rifles , and most of them had revolvers and bowie knives dangling from their belts . Ellery searched their faces for one that resembled Finney 's or Rugg 's or Hailey 's , and failed to find a similar feature . If this was the bandit gang , then another band than the one he had seen at Rancho Linda Vista had committed the robbery . A tall fellow with sandy hair and beard stepped forward and grasped Real 's bridle . " I 'm Jake Curtis , " he said . " I 'm leader of this posse . Who are you , feller , and just what are you doin ' here ? Talk quick ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth twisted upward . " My name is James Ellery . What I am doing here is none of your damned business ! " 93 " The hell it ai n't ? " Curtis exploded . " Drag him off , boys , and we 'll show him . " Half a dozen pairs of hands pulled Ellery from the saddle before he could reach his weapons . Again Curtis faced him . " We 'll give you just five minutes to tell us what you 're doin ' here ! " he stated . " I have nothing more to say , " Ellery declared . " Do n't fool with us ! " Curtis shouted . " We know you 're one of the gang that robbed the Columbia bank and got away with Colonel Beaufort 's gal . Where 's the gal , hombre ? Where 's the rest of the gang ? " Ellery thought swiftly . He recalled his promise to Uncle Sim to say nothing that would give away their plan , even to friends . Blandly he evaded the question . " Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl has been kidnaped ? " When it seemed that his words and looks were about to convince Curtis and most of the others , a man shouted : " Looky hyar , Jake ! This settles it . Knowed he was lyin ' from the first . " He was pointing to the brand on the left stifle of the beautiful horse . " That 's the Diamond E brand of Rancho Linda Vista , by God . We know that at least two of the other fellows that held up the bank rid Don Cayetano 's bosses ! " " I bought this horse , gentlemen , " Ellery declared . " Where ? " demanded Curtis . " From Don Cayetano Esqueval . " " When 'd you buy him ? " 94J " Day before yesterday . " It was just what Ellery should not have answered , for being at Rancho Linda Vista the day before yesterday , and here to-day was proof to the hungry and tired possemen that he might have been in the vicinity of Columbia yesterday afternoon . " I reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined the brand . " You go back to town with us , pronto . " Ellery 's hands were bound behind his back . Curtis growled : " We 'll give you just one more chance to tell where the gal and the rest of your outfit are , feller . Talk fast . " " I have nothing to say , " returned Ellery . " If I told you anything , you would n't believe me . " " Damned right we would n't and you ridin ' a CayetanoEsqueval hors , " a man growled . This was greeted by a chorus of approving chuckles . " We 're lucky to get one of ' ern , " declared Curtis . " H'ist him up , boys ; and let 's get started . " Ellery was lifted into the saddle . To struggle would have been futile . Curtis waved the men to their horses . " All right , Pete , let 's go ! " Suddenly the white forest reverberated with the report of a rifle . As the horse leaped ahead Ellery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal 's rump , sprawled on his back in the snow. 95CHAPTER IXThe shot , the wild leap of the horse , Ellery 's scramblingfall , were so unexpected that they might have been a prank of the forest gods themselves . A man grasped the bridle as the horse jumped past , but every other man whirled toward the ridge , gaped , then leaped for the rifles that leaned against the tree , though toward the ridge not a living thing was in sight . Ellery scrambled to his feet . He , of all the men , had an idea as to the origin of the shot , and he was by no means certain . Men leaped for the protection of trees . Three plunged into the thicket . The man who held the horse suddenly dropped the bridle , but Ellery ran to the animal , and by turning his back managed to hold the dragging reins . Real was shying and whistling through his red nostrils . " Keep under cover , men ! " Curtis shouted from behind a tree . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shows himself , and shoot this one if he makes a move to run . " " I sha n't run , " said Ellery . He was now the only man in plain view of the ridge , and he was smiling broadly . " That bullet came plenty close , " Curtis declared . " Be keerful he do n't get a bead on any of you men . " 96Two minutes passed , then from the ridge came a high-keyed voice , vibrant with anger and mirth : " Ye drat danged white-livered pups , if ye think ye 're skeered ' bout ' nough , ye mought come out and show yerselves . If ye ai n't " Who the hell are you ? " Curtis shouted , barely peeping around his tree . " Just show yourself ! " A wild war-whoop rang through the forest . It was a shrill , tremulous cry that made the skin creep along the men 's spines , even Ellery 's . " I 'm Uncle Sim Knight from Turkey Track Holler back in the Blue Mountings o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cut my teeth on the bar'l o ' a squirrel rifle . If any o ' ye want to see whuther I 'm a-lyin ' , jest ye show the corner o ' one eye ! " There was a short silence , then a man shouted : " It 's nothin ' but old Sim Knight ! Wal , by Gawd ! " The relief in the tone was immeasurable . The next instant Uncle Sim himself appeared from behind a pine on top of the ridge . His rifle was ready . His coonskin cap was over one ear , and he was chuckling loudly . Down the snow-panoplied slope he came , not unlike an avenging patriarch of the forest . Men emerged from their hiding places now . Fifty feet from the nearest , Uncle Sim stopped . He had ceased chuckling . " Ye drat-dasted litter o ' illegitimate pups , what ye mean a-cartin ' off this hyar friend o ' mine ? It war a danged good thing I showed up . I orter take out my old toad-sticker and cut all yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , explaining , apologizing . " But what on earth are you doin ' here , Uncle Sim ? " Curtis demanded . Before the old man replied he strode forward and with a sweep of his long knife he slashed the belt that bound Ellery 's wrists . " Thank you , Uncle Sim , " said Ellery , flexing his arms and smiling . " Do n't mention it , Jim . Ye 're shore welcome as hell . Jake Curtis , ye drat danged fool , if ye want to know why me ' n ' Jim 's hyar , we wuz jest roamin ' round lookin ' fer a big grizzly I run acrost t' other day , biggest b'ar I ever seed the tracks of , by , Gawd ! When Jim showed up at my camp yistiday , and I told him ' bout that b'ar , we ' cided to git him afore he holed up fer the winter . " Uncle Sim suddenly strode up to the astounded Curtis , and thrust out his beard . His old blue eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyar friend o ' mine , ye damned senseless varmint ? I got a notion to cut yer ornery throat ! " " We  --  we just thought he was one of the bank robbers , " Curtis stuttered . " Or one of the fellers that got away with the gal , Uncle Sim . We 're  --  we 're damned sorry we made a mistake . " " Wal , ye better be ! Bank robbers ? Gal ? " Uncle Sim 's face was innocent . " What ye a-talkin ' ' bout , Jake ? We ai n't heerd o ' no bank bein ' robbed or no gal stole . " " That 's what I told them , Uncle Sim , " interrupted Ellery , " but they would n't believe inc. " 98J " He was ridin ' a hoss with the Cayetano brand , " declareda man . " Two of the robbers rid nags with that brand , and that was proof enough for us . " The men grouped about Uncle Sim and all talked at once in their endeavor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Sim 's indignation had been superb . Now his incredulity was beyond fault . " Wal , drat my hide ! " he muttered . " This hyar 's news to me . We did n't know nothin ' ' bout no robbery or nothin ' , wuz jest out after that b'ar I wuz tellin ' ye ' bout . Ai n't that right , Jim ? " " It 's the truth , Uncle Sim . " Ellery smilingly accepted the apologies of the men for the mistake they had made . " Do n't think any more about it , gentlemen , " he advised . " Mistakes will happen , and I see your side of this case . It 's lucky for me , though , that Uncle Sim was near by . " The old man listened while the men told of their long hunt through the night , after Colonel Beaufort had offered ten thousand dollars for the discovery of his daughter . " Wall , " Uncle Sim combed his whiskers thoughtfully , " the way it looks to me , ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . Thar ai n't no chance a-tall them robbers 'd head back this away . Now if I was ye I 'd scat back to below snow-line . Like ' s not when ye git to Columbia yell find this Miss Nancy safe and sound , and them bank robbers strung up and startin ' to dry . Danged if this hyar ai n't some s'prise to me ! I 'm shore sorry I missed all the ' citement. " 99The cold and half-starved members of the searchingparty were eager enough to start for home , especially as another day in the high country meant that they might be snowed in . They began making quick preparations for the start . " After Jim ' n ' me 's seed ' bout that old grizzly we 'll skirt down toward the Nawth Fork and see what we kin see , " said Uncle Sim . " If we find anything o ' them robbers we 'll ride in and let ye-all know , fellers . " Curtis said that this was a good plan . He led his men away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few minutes later , he returned astride the sorrel mare , he found Ellery with a puzzled frown on his cold face . " Why did n't you let them go with us , Uncle Sim ? " " Huh ? Them danged fools tag along with us ? One old she-b'ar 's got more sense'n that whole passel o ' varmints . Did n't they show how danged leetle they knowed by tryin ' to take ye back to town ? Drat dang my skin , people in this hyar country 's still too ready to suspect every stranger . Why did n't ye tell ' em ' bout it , Jim ? " " I gave you my word I would n't , Uncle Sim . " The old man 's jaw dropped and his eyes bulged . " Wal , by Gawd ! " he ejaculated slowly . " I did n't mean ye wuz to keep yer danged mouth shet in a case like that , Jim . They 'd had ye in the jug by evening . " " I know they would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Danged if ye ai n't ' bout the coolest customer I ever seed , Jim ! Most men 'd be a leetle ' cited , but 100ye 're ' bout as ' cited as them snowflakes that 's : beginnin ' to come down ag'in . Wal , ye know I started fer that knob over yander ? Afore I 'd gone a hundred yards I seed what I wanted . Then I jest took the back trail to find ye . Kind o ' lucky I did , war n't it ? " " Mighty lucky for me , Uncle Sim . " The rain had ceased and through rifts in the clouds shafts of sunlight shot , to touch the bosom of the raindrenchedvalley , when Carlotta Esqueval came to the door of the big casa . She was a vivid creature with her crimson dress and black mantilla , and her eyes were still drowsy and mysterious from the long night 's sleep . Smoke rolled heavily from the adobe huts that encircled the knoll , and around the corrals , peons with their shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning work . It was a soggy morning at Rancho Linda Vista . The broad pencils of light that came through the cloud rifts were the only things to tell that there was warmth and color above the leaden sky . Carlotta leaned against the lintel of the thick wall and breathed deeply of the rain-washed air . It was good to inhale dampness after so many long hot days , but Carlotta shuddered at the thought that winter had come . She was a creature of the sun . From where she stood she had a view of the trail that led southward to the foothills . Suddenly her eyes opened , then narrowed . Their drowsiness van-101ished . She stepped from the doorway , peered for a moment , then stepped back into it . " Padre ! " she called . " Some one comes ! " Don Cayetano appeared , crossing the big room . He , too , looked toward the trail . " Five horsemen , " he commented . " They are cominghere , Carlotta . There shall be five mouths more to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I see , five unwelcome ones , " said the girl . " One of the caballeros ees that Beel Yerkes from Sonora . That man I do not like ! " " Beel Yerkes ? " Don Cayetano cried with what sounded like relief in his fine old voice . " I had thought it was that infamous Jack Finney and his men returning , querida . Por Dios , I hope they come no more ! " She whirled upon him , her beautiful face suddenly almost savage . " For why do you not want Don Jack ? Do you not know eet ees heem Carlotta loffs ? Caramba ! Don Cayetano shrugged , for he had long since learned the futility of trying to reason against these outbursts , yet he must have a word . " This Don Jack and his men will bring dishonor sooner or later on Rancho Linda , Vista , querida . " Carlotta shrugged now . " For what do we care what theenk the gringos of the mines ? Don Jack do I loff , and I will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ees a ver ' brave caballero ! " The fifth man of Yerkes ' posse was Joe Tucker. 102 Tucker had ridden all night with the news of Nancy Beaufort 's disappearance , and had joined the other four men only an hour before . The five rode up the lane , up the slope , and reined in under the oaks . Carlotta eyed them through narrowed lids , and withoutcordiality . " Buenos dias , senores , " saluted Don Cayetano , who never , under any circumstances , forgot his hospitality . " Alight and rest , senores . You have ridden far , no ? " " From Columbia , Cayetano , " returned Yerkes . " We come lookin ' for three , maybe four , Americans . Are they here ? " In a few minutes the men led their animals toward the stables . Carlotta turned upon her father with flashing eyes . " Fool , why did you tell them Don Jack and his friends had been here but two days ago ? " she cried in Spanish . Don Cayetano met her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though he realized he was powerless to cope with her , he loved her with all the love in his heart . " I have told them that Don Jack was here , because such men as he bring dishonor on our heads . Have you no shame , daughter of mine ? Do you not realize that this is no more Mexico , but the land of the Americanos ? " " And a sad land it is ! " she retorted . " What do I care for all these gringos who respect the law of the Americans ? What makes me love Don Jack is that he has no respect for these laws ! " 103Don Cayetano , hoping to ward off another outburst , went into the casa to order breakfast for his guests . Presently the girl followed him . When she came out she carried a , brimming pitcher of wine , and a cup . The five men were trudging up the slope . Patches of warm crimson played under the olive skin of Carlotta 's cheeks , and in her black eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine as the five Americans stopped before her . Her eyes lifted shyly , yet with a faint light of admiration in their smoky depths . " Por Dios , you brave hombres have ridden so far durin ' the long night you must be ver ' cold , " she cried . " Take thees leetle drink , Senor Beel , and you will teengle with the warmth to your ver ' toes ! " Bill Yerkes drained the cup , and instantly confessed that he could feel the effect of the wine to his toenails . It was indeed potent stuff , this sweet wine of Rancho Linda Vista . Carlotta poured it for the other men , who drank avidly . " That 's sure a warmin ' drink , Carlotta , " declared Yerkes . " God , but it was cold last night ! Snowin ' hard back in the mountains . " " Ah , Senor Beel , " Carlotta 's eyes were suddenly wide with astonishment , " eet ees not true that the one leetle drink you feel , no ? Eef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strong man Carlotta has theenk you . Caramba , just un leetle drink more ! " Yerkes needed little urging , nor did the other men ; and when they had each drained a second cup of the muscatel , their eyes were glassy , and near-by objects104jseemed far away . Carlotta persuaded them to take a little more wine before breakfast was called . It was a bounteous breakfast , as meals always were at Rancho Linda , Vista when guests were at table . The men ate like wolves . " Cayetano , I figure that if we wait here , that redheadedrobber 'll soon show up , " Yerkes informed his host . " You got any objections ? " Don Cayetano cast a quick glance at his daughter . Her face was vivid with approval . " Bueno , Sefior Beel ! " she cried . " Un ver ' wise plan eet ees ! Thees red-head hombre he ees fall in loff with me , and I hate heem ! I wish you stay at el rancho and shoot heem ! " Though Don Cayetano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his daughter , he heaved a sigh of relief and told his visitors that Rancho Linda Vista was theirs as long as they cared to enjoy its hospitality . " I 'd like to find some place for my men to sleep , " Yerkes said thickly , but with importance , for he had drunk two more cups of the wine . " Bueno ! " Don Cayetano agreed . He wanted to escort the men to the best bedrooms , but they insisted upon merely having blankets . They sprawled upon the floor of the big room . Carlotta , was now diplomatically bracing the big deputy as they walked outside . Yerkes had told his men he would stand the first watch . Without his knowing how he got there , he found himself sitting on105the bench against the big oak , and hazily saw the girl smiling down at him . " You are steel the ver ' tired man , Senor Beel . Un poco mas vino , and you will be ver ' strong again , no ? Carlotta she likes the men so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlotta , " Yerkes confessed , stretching his arms , and yawning . He tried with a sudden inward sweep to catch her , but she stepped nimbly back . She flashed into the casa , and in a minute flashed out , bearing a pitcher of wine . Now she sat down beside him and slipped one arm about his neck while she filled the cup he held unsteadily . A quarter of an hour later she gently slid from his embrace and got to her feet . The contempt in her eyes was illimitable as she looked down at him . She spat insolently . " Puerco ! Peeg of a fool ! " she hissed . " You will sleep long , and ver ' sound , no ? " She called a mozo and told him to saddle La Reina . As she came from the house , clad in charro trousers and bolero , and with a poncho flung across her arm , she stopped long enough to stare contemptuously at Yerkes , who was leaning against the bole of the tree , and snoring . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great rancho in the hope that she would find Jack Finney and his men , that she might warn them . She knew she would be back before Yerkes or his tired men awoke , for more than once she herself had tested the sleep-inducing potency of the sweet wine of the rancho. 106CHAPTER XFrom the crest of a white ridge Uncle Sim and Ellery had a magnificent view of the white world . The storm had abated temporarily except for squalls that trailed across the white forest . To their left was a mighty canyon , so deep that the snow-line came half-way down its rugged sides . " That thar 's the Stanislaus , " the old man explained . " Turrible rough . Best b'ar country I ever seed . " It was rough country , but little rougher than that immediately ahead of the cold travelers  --  gash-like cuts in the range , high ridges , some timbered and others with the snow lying on bare granite ; tall peaks . Above all the cloud mass was drawn like a leaden line from north to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half deep . Through it the tired horses trudged , along timbered slopes , skirting peaks , winding about the heads of canyons too rugged to be crossed . About mid-forenoon Ellery saw another deep canyon far to the right . Uncle Sim explained that it was the north fork of the Tuolumne . Beyond it the forested land stretched white , cold , illimitable . Snow was falling again , great wet , soggy flakes that melted as they struck the men and horses . Ellery and Uncle Sim were now chilled to the bone. 107 One minute Ellery was sure that the bandits had not harmed Nancy Beaufort , merely taken her fine horse and turned her afoot . The next he was certain she was in their clutches . His determination to overtakethe bandit gang became an obsession . It warmed him , comforted him , justified the long ride , the storm , everything . As for Uncle Sim , he was as silent most of the time as a gray old sphinx . Now he broke trail on the little sorrel mare . Then Ellery on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . It was past noon when Uncle Sim called a halt in a thick patch of timber into which but little snow had drifted . " I 'd give a dollar fer a snort o ' cawn-juice , " he grunted as he slid stiffly from the saddle . " I 'd give a hundred , " Ellery retorted . While Ellery unsaddled , the old man got a fire going with what seemed like magic , for everything in the forest was wet . They spread their hands to the warmth of the leaping flame . " It 's a bad storm , " said Ellery . " All storms is bad , Jim , but thar never wuz one so danged bad it could n't ' a ' been wuss . Ye orter see this country three months from now , boy . Thar wo n't be nothin ' in sight but the tree-tops . " " I do n't want to see it then , " declared Ellery heavily . They broiled their venison , warmed their bread , munched them down . But for Ellery 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . He could hardly believe that even the most desperate of 108 bandits would penetrate this snow-clad region , with only the prospect of deeper snow ahead . " Uncle Sim , do you really know where we are going ? " he demanded . " If I did n't , I would n't be a-goin ' , Jim . Jest what are ye goin ' to do when we git thar , boy ? It wo n't be long . " " I 'm going to begin shooting . " Uncle Sim eyed him long and sarcastically . " Then by Gawd , ye might ' s well turn back right hyar ! I do n't ' tend to have no damned shootin ' fool ' long with me . I figgered ye had sense , boy . I 'm sort o ' disapp'inted in ye . " " Well , what would you have me do , Uncle Sim ? " " Show ye got somethin ' under yer hat ' sides skin and bone ! " snorted the old man . " Jim , do n't ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find mebbe half a dozen , mebbe a dozen ? Ye ' n ' me 's jest two . " Ellery was thoughtful for a long time . Then he said : " I 'll do what you say , Uncle Sim . I 'll admit I do n't know your plans . I wish I did . " " Then I ' low thar wo n't be no harm in tellin " em to ye , " said the old man . " Now ye listen keerful , and if ye do n't heed ye 're danged likely to leave yer bones up hyar in the snow . " The thrill of adventure , of imminent battle was in Ellery 's veins as they started on . He forgot the cold . He had reloaded and capped his revolvers lest some of the snow water might have made powder or caps109useless . Uncle Sim always took meticulous care to keep the breech of his heavy rifle dry , but he paid no particular attention to his revolver . They had not traveled an hour more before they came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the natural place for the trail , and when they halted in the thick timber in the bottom of the pass Uncle Sim slid from his saddle and began examining the ground . From his saddle Ellery made out horse tracks . He dismounted and bent over them . " Here 's the tracks of the girl 's horse , Uncle Sim ! " " Wal , do n't yell it to the mounting tops , clang ye ! I seed it ! " Leading their horses , they followed the trail and had not gone a hundred yards before they came upon the blackened , soggy embers of a campfire . About it were the tracks of many horses and men . Uncle Sim began examining them carefully , but no more carefullythan did Ellery . " Uncle Sim , look here ! " Ellery suddenly called . He was kneeling , peering down . When the old man had taken one quick look he said calmly : " It 's jest the gal 's track , Jim . I seed ' nother like it jest as ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 've got her ! " " Wal , she 's a danged sight better off with them ' n bein ' hyar alone . " " But why did they take her , Uncle Sim ? " Ellery again felt the conviction that he was to blame for the girl 's peril . " Thar 's gin'rilly a reason fer everything , Jim . " 110Ellery swung wrathfully upon the old man . " Uncle Sim , why do n't you tell me what you know ? " " ' Cause I do n't know nothin ' ' cept they got the gal , and whar I 'm goin ' , boy . Jest keep yer shirt on . " Uncle Sim soon announced that here was where the bandits had spent most of the night . " They wuz jest ' bout hyar when the storm busted loose , and they wuz so danged cold ' n ' tired they figgered it 'd be better to wait till mornin ' . " When they started on the old man took the lead . There was now a plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plateau-like ridge between the deep canyons . For two hours the trailers followed it . Then behind a timbered spur Uncle Sim called a halt . " Leave the hpsses , " he instructed . They climbed to the crest , from where Ellery saw a small valley-like depression , almost entirely rimmed by the snow-laden forest . Through the trees , however , he caught a glimpse of a small patch of white level . " It 's only a mountain meadow , Uncle Sim , " he said disappointedly . " Thar 's fresh trail leadin ' into it , ai n't thar ? " Getting the horses , they led them across the ridge . They did not remount now . Uncle Sim led the way , and several times as they descended through the foresthe turned quickly and grasped the nostrils of the mare to stifle a whinny . Real was restive now , and Ellery watched him closely lest he should lift his head and trumpet a call. 111They struck the head of a , short canyon , its slopes magnificently forested with pines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow . " I ' low we better leave the hosses hyar , " Uncle Sim said when they came to a little flat across which the trail led . " They 'll whicker shore if we take ' em closer . " A hundred yards farther on he turned to Ellery , who was at his heels . Ellery had already seen what the old man was to point out  --  four horses picketed in the little snow-clad meadow which was so completelyshrouded in the forest that discovery of it would have been sheer accident by any one except Uncle Sim Knight . " I war up hyar b'ar huntin ' not so long ago , " whispered the old man . " I seed somethin ' that set me to thinkin ' . " " They 're here , Uncle Sim ! " Ellery cried softly . " Wal , did ye figger they would n't be ? " They crept from tree to tree , to a spot near the edge of the snow-covered meadow . Seven horses were now in sight . Two of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry grass . Ellery saw the beautiful sorrel Nancy Beaufort had ridden . The animal 's back was hunched , and its coat was rough . " Where 's the cabin , Uncle Sim ? " he called softly to the old man . " Pander to yer right , agin that clump o ' saplin 's . " Ellery had to look twice before he discovered a fair-sized log cabin , it had been that carefully screened. 112 " I ' lowed that thar cabin war n't fer no good puppose , " growled Uncle Sim . " Struck me as danged ' spicious fust time I seed it . " Uncle Sim beckoned Ellery back into the timber . When they were safely away from the meadow Ellery demanded : " What are we going to do ? " He had to strangle the impulse to rush the cabin single-handed . " Thar 's seven hosses , which means six men , " said the old man . " We could likely rush ' em , and git mebbe two or three , and we could lay out hyar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they come ; but that 'd likely mean they 'd harm the gal , or wuss . Thar ai n't no other way'n mine , Jim . " Uncle Sim detailed his plan as they trudged back up the trail for the horses . The sheer boldness and audacity of it made Ellery 's blood run hot with pleasure . He admired the old man more than before . " It may work , " he conceded dubiously . " But if it does n't it 's the best we can do . Uncle Sim , we ca n't risk their harming the girl . Lord , they may have harmed her already . " " To my way o ' thinkin ' that ai n't likely . Thar 's somethin ' deep down under all this hyar . It ai n't no accident , boy . " Uncle Sim had but a vague idea of the plot . He did not know that for months the bandits had been laying their plans for the bold stroke they had so far successfullyconsummated . They had discovered the hidden meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For weeks first one of them , then another had been in 113 Columbia , spying upon the bank , upon Colonel Beaufortand his daughter . " If any of ' em 's outside we got to take our chances , " Uncle Sim advised as he lifted himself into the saddle . " Jim , ye jest be preepared to , back up some o ' the dangest lyin ' ye ever heerd , and do some on yer own ' count . And do ' er with a straight face . " " I think I know about what to say , Uncle Sim . I promise I wo n't shoot unless it seems the only way out . " " Wal , when it seems that away , ye better count fifty afore ye shoot . " They rode down the trail now , taking no particular trouble to conceal themselves , and out into the sparser timber at the edge of the flat . Here they reined up . " Thar do n't ' pear to be nobody outside , " said the old man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm glad they 're at least keeping Miss Beaufort warm , " declared Ellery . The old man turned toward him , and grinned . " Hell 's rated a warm place , Jim , but I never heerd o ' nobody wantin ' to go thar . Have ye ? " " No ! " Ellery 's heart was heavy with fear of what might have happened to the girl , and filled with a savage determination to carry through to the limit . They rode knee to knee now , straight toward the cabin , which , in the door side , had no other opening . The door was closed . The pillar of smoke that rolled from the rock chimney loomed blue against the white forest . Out in the flat the horses had thrown up their 114 heads . Two of them began to whinny and tug at their picket ropes . Ellery dropped a hand to within easy reach of a revolver . Uncle Sim flogged the sorrel mare with his heels and she broke into a trot . Ellery touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no sound in the soft snow . Almost before the door they reined up . Uncle Sim flung up his head , then across the white waste rang his war-whoop , a quavering , eerie , bloodcurdlingyell . It died in a weird , tremulous cry , then : " What ' n hell ye-all mean in thar , a-takin ' my cabin ? Come out and give a ' count o ' yersel 's ! " In the utter silence that seemed to endure for an hour Ellery tried to sit nonchalantly in his saddle , but his every nerve and muscle were tensed . It took all his will to keep his hands off his guns . Uncle Sim Knight , however , seemed as cool as the snow itself . He was lolling in his saddle and biting a chew off a twist of natural leaf as the door flung open to admit a deluge of grim men. 115 CHAPTER XIEllery had expected nothing less than a hail of bulletsout of which he was determined to sell his life dearly , but he was disappointed . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin was armed , not one made a movement toward a gun . Uncle Sim 's face was now a bewhiskered mask . Ellery had instantly recognized Finney , Rugg and Hailey . The other three were as hard looking . Ellerysaw , too , that he had been recognized by the three men . " Howdy , " said Uncle Sim . " Seems ye 're right comfortable . " It was a situation where a wrong word , even a wrong look might have meant sudden death . Ellery waited , but not long . " What you want ? " drawled Finney . He was a handsome fellow even in his rough garb . Like Rugg and Hailey , he had forsaken the Mexican attire . " We 'd like first of all to git in out of the cold , and have some grub , " said Ellery . " Lord , but it 's a bad storm ! " " Well , you ca n't get either here , " growled Finney . " There ai n't any room . Besides , we 've only got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 116 Uncle Sim spat copiously , entirely unmoved by the lack of hospitality . " I 'd sorter hate to call ye a pack o ' damned liars , " he declared with a grin , " but not so long ago I happenedonto this hyar cabin , and it 's fair well stocked with grub . I was figurin ' on holin ' up hyar after I 'd done my last job down in the mines . " Finney 's cold eyes continued to question Ellery . He demanded fiercely : " How come you 're here ? Last time I saw you was at Rancho Linda Vista ? " " I 'd have been there yet if you 'd had your way , Buck Harper , " Ellery said , unruffled . " That was a slick game you and the Mexican girl hatched up , but it did n't work . " Finney had tensed like an overstrained fiddle-string . His arms were crooked , his hands close to his guns . Everybody else was now looking at the two . " What the hell are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ellery 's chuckle increased the tenseness of Finney 's body , the pallor of his face . " You did n't think I 'd be caught in such a crude trap as you and Carlotta set for me , did you , Harper ? " he asked good-naturedly . " That was as easy to see through as an open window , man ! " Finney took a step . His tautened fingers crept closer to his gun handles . " What you mean by callin ' me Harper ? " " I mean , " returned Ellery , " that I 'm calling you by your right name , Buck . I recognized you the min- 117 ute I set eyes on you there at the rancho . If I had wanted to take advantage of my discovery I could have ridden into Sonora and told the officers , could n't I ? " " I reckon you could , " Harper replied , but without any concessions . " Why did n't you , then ? " " I did n't want to . My action ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle Sim 's mouth was now open , his eyes wide with astonishment . " Hell and mo-lasses ! " he ejaculated . " Ye do n't mean to tell me this fine lookin ' red-haid is Buck Harper , the feller what raised hell in the Nawthern Mines fer so danged long ? I 'm shore pleased to meet ye , Buck , bein ' a sort o ' criminal myself . ' Course I ai n't a bad un like ye , bein ' just give to robbin ' sluice boxes and cabins . Onct in a while I cut a feller 's throat . " Ellery slowly dismounted , keeping his hands well away from his guns . Buck Harper cast a glance toward the old man . " What 's your name ? " he demanded in a voice of suspicion . " Wal , jest at prisent I 'm called Hedgehog Davis , " said Uncle Sim . Ellery was quick to see that his failure to report the discovery of the notorious bandit to the officers was making an impression . Harper seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes swerve from Ellery 's . " Then if you did n't turn me in to the officers , why ? " he demanded. 118 " Men who live in glass houses should n't throw stones , Buck . " " Then you 're one of us ? " " Not exactly one of you , " Ellery corrected . " I work on my own hook most of the time , except when I join up with Hedgehog here . We were just running away from a little piece of work down in the low country . What 's the matter with letting us share your cabin till the storm blows out ? " Harper was weighing this request when Uncle Sim spoke up : " Wal drat clang my hide ! In all my wuthless old life I ai n't never been treated so danged onhospiterable , even by a pack o ' lowdown cut-throats like ye-all . Ye kin jest go plumb to hell if ye do n't want comp'ny o ' the likes o ' me ' n ' Bronco Jim . " Ellery saw every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim had been almost as notorious in the Northern Mines as Buck Harper , and like Harper , he had disappeared when the hue and cry had grown too hot . It was a bold stroke . Ellery realized that even here among these bandits there might well be men who had ridden with Bronco Jim , or that Bronco Jim himself might be one of them . He breathed a little easier when he noticed some of the tenseness fade from Harper 's look . A light of faint admiration mixed with surprise , came into the outlaw leader 's face . " Are you Bronco Jim Cato ? " he demanded . " I am , suh , " responded Ellery , who knew that Cato , too , had been a Southerner. 119 " What have you got to prove it ? " " My word , " said Ellery calmly , " but if that is n't enough , Harper , I 'm not against stepping out here in the snow and settling the matter , guns or knives . I 'm not accustomed to having my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I , " growled Uncle Sim . " I 'm jest a ornery old sneak-thief , but thar 's nothin ' suits me better'n a fight ! " It was well that Ellery knew that Bronco Jim Cato had been one of the best shots and most vicious knife wielders in all the wild country . He saw two things . One was that none of the men had known Cato , the other was that this bold challenge was not without effect , especially upon Harper , who , though a daring bandit , had never sought close encounter . He was a moderate shot , and while he always carried a long bowie , had shunned the use of it . " If you 're Bronco Jim Cato I do n't see any reason why we ca n't be friendly , " said Harper . " I would n't turn a dog out in a storm like this , especially if he was a bad dog . " " I told you who I am , " Ellery declared , eyes level , " but if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter right now , Harper . Guns or knives ? " " And by Gawd , if thar 's any o ' ye doubts I 'm Hedgehog Davis , jest let him speak up , " challenged Uncle Sim . " This hyar old toad-sticker o ' mine 's carved me outen more'n one fracas . I 'll take on any two o ' ye to once ! " His eyes , now fiery , swept the bearded faces . " Do n't get hot in the collar , old man , " Rugg warned 120 with a metallic chuckle . " From the way you look you might be anything from an old grizzly down . Besides , you do n't look like you 've got sense enough to do any tall lyin ' . " Uncle Sim grinned sheepishly . " Wal , " he conceded , " I ai n't got more'n the brains o ' a louse . I ' low that 's what makes me sech a fightin ' fool . Is thar any o ' ye as 'd like to tangle up with old Hedgehog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man accepted the challenge . Hedgehog Davis was an entirely mythical character , but as Harper and his men were comparatively new in the southern country , they had no way of proving it . Moreover , Uncle Sim , hunched on the sorrel mare , eyes gleaming half-insanely , hand on the hilt of his bowie , was not a man to doubt . His belligerent glare and Ellery 's nonchalant coolnessdid more than hours of argument to convince the bandits . There was not one of the men who had not heard of the daring Bronco Jim Cato . Harper turned to his men , and after telling " Nugget " and " Arkansaw " to watch the newcomers , took Hadley , Rugg and Tex Winder and walked a little way . They conferred a few minutes and walked back . " I reckon you can stay till the storm 's over , " Harper declared . " Bein ' as you 're bad ones , too , there ought to be honor among thieves . " Uncle Sim tumbled off the mare , but Ellery made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck , I 'm willing that the little try you and the121girl , Carlotta , made to get me and my gold be called a closed matter . Is that agreeable to you ? " Harper , after a long scrutiny , shrugged . " I 've forgot it long ago . Buck Harper never remembersfailures , Bronco . " The bandit chief , however , was even then planning the death of this rival . " Thar 's one thing more what might convince ye danged cut-throats me ' n ' Jim 's tellin ' the truth , " declared Uncle Sim as he bit off a chew . All eyes were turned upon him . " Well , what is it , Hedgehog ? " Harper demanded . " Wal , me ' n ' Jim know ye-all robbed the bank in Columbia yistiday and got away with Cunnel Beaufort'spurty gal . Do n't it stand to reason that if we wuze n't ornery ourselves we 'd ' a ' went back and told the orficers , ' stead o ' ridin ' in hyar ? The whole danged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We seed one posse not more'n ten miles down , but we managed , by some tall lyin ' , to head it back , tellin ' them danged fools Char war n't no sense in pressin ' on into the snow . Even the b'ars is holed-up hyar in this snow now . " If Ellery or Uncle Sim had expected any surprise at this disclosure , he was to be disappointed . The bandits merely grinned at one another . Tex and Rugg shrugged slightly . If any last bit of proof was needed , Uncle Sim had added it . Ellery and Uncle Sim were certain that for the time being they were safe , but neither trusted the bandits . Their problem now was to work out a plan by which they could kill or capture the men and rescue the girl . Both knew it was going to be hazardous. 122 Harper sauntered into the cabin , but the other banditsremained outside , talking with apparent cordiality to Uncle Sim and Ellery as they unsaddled . Ellery expected to get a chance for a few words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat , but he was to be disappointed . Rugg and Tex accompanied them , the former carrying an axed two oaken pins which he drove into the snowy earth . The ends of the picket ropes were fastened to the pins , and the four men walked toward the cabin . Uncle Sim and Ellery watched for a chance to exchange eye-messages , but though the other men did not appear suspicious , their vigilance was so thorough that the newcomers did not dare more than a casual glance . " I suppose you 're figuring on holding the girl for ransom ? " ventured Ellery . " Do n't do too much such figgerin ' , stranger , " Rugg warned . " If you 're hankerin ' to know , though , you might ask Buck . He 's the boss of this outfit . " " No offense meant , " Ellery replied suavely . " I do n't care a damn what you do with her , but if I were in your boots I would n't want any girl on my hands . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but as long as we got her we got to make the most of her . This storm raised hell . " Uncle Sim stopped to squint up at the sky , out of which snowflakes still sifted . " This hyar storm 's not over by a danged sight . I sort o ' figger it 's the beginnin ' o ' winter . " Hailey , Arkansaw and Nugget had gone into the woods and the sound of their axes rang across the snow 123 as the other men stopped in front of the cabin . Voices came from within , and in one of them Ellery recognized the soft accents of Nancy Beaufort . His blood ran hot as he realized how completely she was in the clutches of these men , how powerless he was , for the present , to aid her . But would she accept his as-sistance ? He was not long to be kept in doubt . He knew he must meet another test , perhaps the crucial one , when he faced the girl . Whether the story he and Uncle Sim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely upon the girl 's attitude . Rugg said : " Come on in out of the cold . " He , led the way . Tex brought up the rear . The room was lighted only by the flames in the rude fireplace and tie light that came through the open door . When Tex closed the door the gloom was like that of late twilight . Ellery made out a rough table in the middle of the dirt floor . Across the end of the room several crude bunks had been built . A double blanket was stretched across the other end . There were three stools and three chunks of wood to serve as seats . As Ellery 's eyes grew accustomed to the gloom he made out a huddled figure on a stool to the right of the fireplace , felt two burning eyes upon him . He stiffened , thrust back his shoulders , and took off his hat . " Good evening , ma'am , " he said , bowing , " I hope I do not intrude . " The girl rose slowly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still wore the green riding habit . It was torn and dirty . Her hair was in disorder , but despite the ordeals she had undergone her face was still beautiful , proud , unafraid . " Wal , drat me if it ai n't a lady ! " Uncle Sim ejaculated . " Howdy , ma'am . " Nancy Beaufort instinctively acknowledged the old man 's greeting . " Good evening . " Then her eyes swept back to Ellery , whose handsome face was impassive . " You ? " she cried . " You coward ! You dishonorablecur ! You villain ! " Even in the poor light Ellerycould see that she trembled with indignation . The hauteur and loathing on her smoke-smudged face were unmistakable . He chuckled with all the good nature he could force . " I am glad you have not forgotten me , Miss Beau-fort . " " Forgotten you , you villain ? " she cried . " I hope I shall remember you to the last day of my life ! However , I had expected that you would seek companyof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had hoped her recognitionwould be at least casual . Now what was he to do to make her believe that he was her friend ? He felt Harper 's eyes upon him and turned to meet the questioning gaze of the red-headed bandit leader . " Then you have met this girl before , Bronco Jim ? " " Yes , " returned Ellery , meeting the challenging stare squarely . " I met her on the trail not long before your men got her yesterday , and  --  took some-125thing away from her , Buck . It 's apparent she still remembers me . " Harper turned now to the trembling girl , whose eyes still shone with loathing . " Is what he says true ? " he demanded fiercely . " Yes ! It is ! " she cried . " I hate him , he is a bandit , a , robber ! He took " Suddenly she could not speak . With a choking sob she hid her face in her hands and collapsed upon the stool . Ellery had to hold himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bandits , but he felt a deep gratitude toward Nancy now for having identified him as a man worse than those who were responsible for her present cruel position. 126CHAPTER XIINancy Beaufort did not long keep her face hidden . The dignity of a line of proud ancestors would not admit of it , even under these harrowing conditions . There was infinite scorn in her eyes as for a moment they rested upon Ellery . It was as if he were of so little consequence in her life that he was not worth more than the one glance . She gazed into the fire now . As for Ellery , he still had all he could do to keep from jerking out his guns and sowing a harvest of death . What if he should be killed ? That one look she had given him had somehow taken all that was worth while out of life . Like a man drawn into a maelstorm of torment , and powerless to swim without help , he glanced at Uncle Sim Knight , who was in the act of ejecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man shook his head so slightly that the warning went unnoticed by every one except Ellery . It had the effect of steadying him . Nugget , Hailey and Arkansaw came in with armfuls of wood which they dumped against the wall . When they went out for more fuel , Rugg and Tex began the preparation of supper. 127 " If this hyar storm holds , grub 's likely to run short , ai n't it ? " ventured Uncle Sim . " There ai n't any too much , " returned Harper . " We did n't figure on such a storm . " " I ' low I kin git a , deer or two if meat 's needed , " went on the old man . He began to tell of his prowess as a hunter , but no one except the girl seemed to pay him any attention . Ellery knew there was more motivethan the desire to furnish meat back of Uncle Sim 's proposal . While the bandits had welcomed a storm to cover their tracks , they were secretly appalled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the valley and thence across to the Coast Range was doubtless cut off by the posses scouring the lower country . To north and south in the mighty canyons were rivers below snow-line , but to seek these meant they would encounter miners working along the streams . While the food supply was sufficient for two weeks or more there was no hope of saving the horses from starvation unless the storm ceased and the snow melted . No one knew the perils of their predicament better than Buck Harper , but this did not dissuade him from pursuing the plans he had laid . Night dropped , cold , gloomy , and it brought a renewalof the storm . The forest bent under the southeastblast , sending down showers of wet snow from pine and fir and oak . The horses had been brought in and tied in the densest part of the thicket back of the cabin . There throughout the night they pawed and stamped and whinnied. 128Supper was a bounteous enough meal of venison , bread , beans and coffee . Harper did not sit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fire , as if he would not for a moment relax his vigilance . Uncle Sim , squatted beside the fire , broiled venison on spits and devoured it with vast relish . Ellery sat across the rude table from the girl , and several times tried to flash her a reassuring message , but always she kept her eyes averted . Ellery said he would clean up the few tin dishes , but when he went out to scour them in the snow Arkansaw accompanied him . When they came back Arkansaw said : " Seen a few stars peekin ' through . Dog-gone , I hope this thing blows herself out . " Uncle Sim got up and stretched , then declared he would go out and take a look at the weather ; but he was not to go alone . Rugg joined him . Outside the old man cast a part of his glance toward the dark heavens . The other part was on Rugg . " Seems to me ye ai n't figgerin ' on leavin ' Bronco Jim or me alone , Rugg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if ye air , thar ai n't no ' casion fer it . We 're jest what we told ye , a couple o ' wuthless cut-throats . " " There ai n't no doubt of that , " Rugg declared . " Anybody can tell that . I 'm a first rate weather prophet myself , Hedgehog . What do you think of ' er ? " She ai n't donenowin ' yit , " said the old man slowly . They went in , where they found that the girl had 129 returned to her stool beside the fire . Ellery was standingnow with his back to the blaze , and Harper was sitting at the table . The other bandits were lying upon their bunks , puffing at pipes or cigarettes . The tobacco smoke , coupled with the wood smoke the gale puffed from the fireplace , made the atmosphere a blue haze . " Young woman , " began Harper , his gaze on the girl , " I suppose you have some idea why you are here . " " I have n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hope . To Ellery she was very beautiful , even with her torn habit and smudged face . " Well , we brought you here because we want money for you , " Harper declared callously . " What else ' d you think ? " " My thoughts are my own , " she replied haughtily . " They are something you can not rob me of , Mister Harper . " " Do n't git so danged uppity ! " growled Rugg . Harper swung a fierce look upon the black-bearded bandit . " Shut your damned mouth , Rugg ! When I want anything from you I 'll ask for it ! " " A ' right , Chief , " Rugg chuckled . " She makes me laugh , though , with her high-and-mighty manners . She orter be glad she 's alive . " " I am , " declared the girl . She turned back to the bandit leader , her eyes striving to keep fear from their depths . " What were you going to say ? " she asked 130 " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willin ' to pay for you , safe and sound , " said Harper , as though he were bargaining for the sale of a horse . Before the girl could reply Ellery spoke up : " Buck , it seems that what you are saying does not concern Hedgehog and me . We 'll go out . " " Never mind ! " the bandit chief growled . " We have n't got anything to hide from you . If you 're as bad as you say , what we 're sayin ' had n't ought to offend you . " " Huh ? " snorted Uncle Sim . " That sort o ' talk ' fend me ? Why drat dast yer ornery hide , Buck Harper , many 's the time I cut a man 's gullet fer sayin ' less . G'wan with yer talk . " Even then Uncle Sim 's crafty old brain was planninghow he was to dispose of the bandits and rescue the girl , but he was not aware that Harper and Rugg , his lieutenant , had already tentatively planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing had prevented them from doing this . It was the old man 's professed knowledge of the country . In one of his periods of apparent boasting , Uncle Sim had told them he could lead them safely out of the snow-swathed mountains if this became necessary . Hope faintly illuminated Nancy 's face as she waited . " We hold you at fifty thousand dollars ! " declared Harper . " Has your father got that much , and will he pay it for you safe and sound ? " " Will he pay it ? " the girl cried . " Oh , my father will pay anything ! He is the richest man in Tuolumne ! If you will only take me to him I will 131see that you get the fifty thousand dollars , and no harm will come to you ! " Ellery clenched his hands until the nails cut the palms . The men on the bunks had swung around and were expectantly listening , their hands close to their guns . Harper chuckled harshly . " Do n't get any notion like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we 've got the money . If we get it you wo n't be harmed . If we do n't " " Oh , I 'm willing to do anything ! " the girl cried . " Only hurry , please hurry ! I know my father is alreadyfrantic ! " " He 'll likely be more worried before you get back to him , unless you tell us whether he 'll pay or not ! " " Of course he will pay ! Colonel Beaufort will pay every cent he has for me safe . " From time to time Uncle Sim stirred the fire or replenishedit . As the red flames lightened the smoky room the details for the collection of the ransom were arranged . It was decided that the girl would have to remain for possibly a week , and she had acceptedthis edict with a stoicism that surprised everybodyexcept Jim Ellery . He , of all the men , had seen what a thoroughbred she was . " If you will excuse me , gentlemen , I think I shall retire , " Nancy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only gentlemen about her . " Hope you have a good sleep , " grunted Harper . " Good night , Miss Beaufort , " Ellery said , bowing . " I hope you have a most refreshing rest . " 132 She gave him a scornful glance , and disappeared behind the blanket curtain . Ellery and Uncle Sim had no bedding except their saddle-blankets , and no objection was raised when they suggested lying down before the fire . Harper spread his bed between the table and the curtain , as if he were to guard against any one molesting the girl . " Are you all right in there , Miss Beaufort ? " he called as he lay down . " Very well , thank you , " Nancy called back . She was on the verge of tears . It was a dismal night . The storm moaned through the tree-tops . Snow continued to pile up on the white earth , though toward morning the clouds began to break and thin . From time to time Uncle Sim flung wood upon the embers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled close to Ellery , who had not slept . Snores emanated from the bunks at the end of the room , and Harper 's heavy breathing showed he was sleeping . " Hssst ! " Uncle Sim whispered . His bearded lips were near Ellery 's ear . Ellery laid a hand upon the old man . " Listen , Jim . I got a scheme fer gittin ' one , mebbe two . Kin ye watch yer chance and take keer o ' the rest ? " " Depend on me , " Ellery whispered . He would have said more , but Uncle Sim rolled to his other side and feigned a snore . Harper awoke before it was light , and roused the other men . While breakfast was cooking Nugget and 133 Arkansaw prepared for their journey . They were to descend to the South Fork of the Stanislaus and work their way down the canyon past Parrott 's Ferry and Italian Bar , then climb out of the canyon and cut across the hills to Columbia . Most of the way would be slow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time they were half-way to the river . Harper told them he would allow them two days for the trip and as much time for the return . They should collect the ransom in a day . It was a longer route than the one over which they had fled , and one so rough that the journey could not be made on horseback . The main advantage in taking it was that two men , apparently miners , trudging down the river canyon would excite no suspicion , and that there was still the danger that posses would be encounteredif the ridge route were chosen . " Tell this Beaufort that unless he pays , and pays pronto , he 'll never see his girl again , " warned Harper as he stood outside giving the men their final instructions . " The girl dies sure if we do n't get the fifty thousand accordin ' to the directions I give you . Yeah , let Beaufort know that if he tries any monkey business Buck Harper 'll come down and get him , too . " Soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the distant summits . Nancy did not appear until an hour after the messengershad gone . She was smiling bravely as she spoke to the huddled men about the fire . She even said good morning to Ellery. 134 " I hope you enjoyed a good rest , Miss Beaufort , " Ellery said . " As good as possible , " she returned coldly . Uncle Sim toasted her some bread , and she sipped her black coffee as she absently ate it . Her face showed plainly the strain under which she labored , and her smile was forced as she replied to the remarks of Tex , Harper , and Hailey . Rugg was sullen but vigilant . " Seems to me this 'd be a powerful fine mornin ' to git a deer or two down below snow , " Uncle Sim remarked . " I got a mind to see what me ' n ' old Betsy kin do , Harper . " . When the bandit chief made no objection , Uncle Sim took a yawning stretch and picked up his rifle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to his feet . " We got ta have meat . I 'm a fair hunter . " " Good idea , " agreed Harper . " Rugg , if the old badger gets any meat you can carry it in for him . " Leaning on the long rifle , Uncle Sim glared at Harper . " War ye alludin ' to me as a old badger , Harper ? " " I was , " replied Harper . " Just in fun , though , Hedgehog . " Uncle Sim relaxed slowly , and picked up the rifle . " Wal , if it war in fun it 's a ' right , but mind ye , Harper , Char 's nothin ' I 'd like better this mornin ' than slittin ' a man 's throat ! " Nancy , who from the moment Ellery and Uncle Sim had arrived had sensed hostility between them and the bandits , stared in horror now . Her hands flew to her quivering throat. 135 " Oh , please do n't quarrel ! " she cried . " Please do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  --  I ca n't bear it ! " " I 'll see it do n't happen again , " declared Harper . " Get on out , men . Next time be careful how you talk before a lady , Hedgehog Davis ! " Uncle Sim swept off his battered coonskin cap and bowed to the horror-stricken girl . " Beg yer pardon all to blazes , ma'am . It war jest my way o ' talkin ' . I 'm plumb harmless ' cept fer my tongue . " Never , perhaps , have men been more watchful of each other than were Rugg and Uncle Sim as they followed the trail broken by Nugget and Arkansaw . Each was apparently scanning the snowy landscape , but in reality each was waiting for the other to make an overt move . Time and again Rugg tried to get the old Carolina man to walk ahead in the partially broken trail , but each time Uncle Sim declared that he never liked a trail . Back in the cabin Ellery tried to appear calm , though his every nerve was tensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike . He stood with his back to the fire and watched Tex and Hailey as they began to play at the table with a pack of greasy cards . They shelled their pockets of a considerablesum of money . Meanwhile Nancy sat upon her stool at Ellery 's left , her small hands extended to the blaze as she replied in monosyllables to remarks from Harper , who stood at the other side of the table. 136 " Better take a hand , Bronco , " suggested Tex , glancingtoward Ellery . " Too early , thanks , " Ellery replied with a shrug . " Why did n't you mention it last night ? There 's nothing I like better than a little game of poker . " Though he did not know it , the man he impersonated , Bronco Jim Cato , had been an inveterate poker player , a fact which was well known to Harper . Harper glanced aside , and the look Ellery caught on his face was one of satisfaction , though his eyes were cold . Ellery could feel the tension increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been for leaving , but the old man 's message of the night before still rang in his ears . He knew that he was but one against three , and that any man of the three was perhaps as formidable as himself . He could see that the men were merely making a pretext at cards , awaiting a signal from their chief . Harper seemed nonchalant , yet Ellery knew he was ready . Ellery felt that he could not wait another minute for what was to come , when the girl unwittinglybroke the tension . She leaped to her feet . Her face wore a rapt look . " Oh ! " she cried softly . " The sun 's out ! I must see it ! The sun on the snow ! " Sunlight was indeed filtering through the loose chinking Before any one could stop her Nancy had the door open and was pressing into the snow . Harper was after her the next instant 137CHAPTER XIIIThe gorgeous beauty of the scene made Nancy forget for the moment that she was a captive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the mountains , but through a break near the lower end of the meadow there stretched a majestic panorama  --  canyons , ridges , distantpeaks , all white as alabaster . Overhead , cloud masses drifted northward across the azure sky . " It 's wonderful ! " the girl cried . " I never believed anything could be so grand , so beautiful ! " " It 's sure mighty pretty , " Harper agreed . His eyes , however , were for her . She was enough to make any man 's blood run faster . " Like it ? " " I have n't words to describe it ! " Determination gripped Ellery as the bandit chief disappeared through the cabin door . This was the time to strike . Ellery , despite the tautness of every nerve and muscle , tried to appear cool as he watched Tex and Hadley at their game . He was sure they were eyeing him more closely than their cards . " Well , if it is n't another stranger come to join us , " he said suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tex and Hailey turned toward the door for 138 an instant , and as they looked back they stared into the muzzles of Ellery 's steady guns . " Hands up ! " Ellery growled softly . " If you make a move , a noise , I 'll shoot ! " Tex and Hailey stared in cold , hard incredulity for an instant , then their hands darted for their revolvers as they leaped to their feet . The reports of Ellery 's guns blurred into one long crash . The reverberations were still filling the cabin as he leaped for the door , a gun in each hand . Simultaneously Harper had sprung for the door from the outside . The men crashed together in the opening . Harper 's ruddy face was contorted with hate . He whipped up his gun , but before he could swing it around , Ellery 's left gun crashed down upon his arm . Harper 's gun dropped into the snow . As Ellery was pivoting to shoot with his other gun , Harper 's left hand shot out and grasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolver in Ellery 's left hand . Struggle as he would , Ellery could not break the other man 's grasp . Out in the snow they surged , each man fighting for his life . Neither uttered a sound , except for his deep breathing . For a minute or so they fought , backing , surging forward , tramping down the snow in a narrow radius . The girl , shocked to inaction by the shots and the combat , stood trembling . The last bit of color drained from her cheeks . Her eyes were wide with horror . Then slowly , as the fight waged nearer , she backed away until she felt the log wall behind her . She139pressed it with her cold hands and watched with fearfascinatedeyes the combat raging in the snow . Somethingtold her that before the fight ended one or both men would be dead . This sudden realization stirred her to action . Glancing inside the cabin , she stood rigid for a moment , then recoiled . Then she was speeding around the cabin as fast as the encumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly that soon Uncle Sim and Rugg were tramping through only a few inches of snow . They were a quarter-mile belowthe lower end of the meadow when the old man said : " We 'll skirt round this away , Rugg . Nugget and Arkansaw 's skeered ever'thing down the main canyon . " Rugg agreed grudgingly . They soon came to the head of a brushy swale with a rocky ridge on each side , a canyon opening below . Across the mighty gorge they could trace the snow-line as if it had been marked out with a ruler . There were a few deer tracks . " I figger thar 's deer down thar in the brush , " said Uncle Sim . " These hyar old fellers is hell and all fer huggin ' the snow-line . Rugg , ye just mosey round to that p'int o ' rocks yander and take yer stand . I 'll go round to the right and then cut through the brush . Bet ye my moccasins I drive some old bucks right up to ye . " Rugg turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man watching the other covertly as he trudged on . Uncle Sim soon reached the rocky hogback , turned140for a moment to see Rugg , then disappeared over the top . There was a cunning , savage grin on Rugg 's dark face as he quickened his stride . He gained the ridge and dropped back of a big rock . He examined the load in his big-bore Sharps rifle , and peered over the rock . " There 'll be one less of ' em when I get through , " he chuckled softly as he gripped the rifle . On the opposite ridge , less than a hundred yards away , Uncle Sim 's face was pressed to a crack between two rocks , and his sharp eyes saw Rugg as he lifted his head above the boulder . " Think ye 're smart , do n't ye ? " the old man muttered . " Wal , afore ye 're smart ' nough to keep up with Uncle Sim Knight from Turkey Track Holler , ye got to stay up all night , Rugg . I done fergot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sliding backward on his belly , Uncle Sim found two sticks , one about four feet long , the other two . With a buckskin string he lashed them together in the form of a cross , with the transverse piece slightly askew . Then he stripped off his buckskin shirt and fitted it onto the sticks . Next he set his coonskin cap atop the projecting end of the upright , and made a few adjustments to the effigy . " I shore hate to git a hole in this hyar shirt , " he muttered with a grin . He picked up his rifle , eased back the big hammer . Then with his left hand he slowly raised the effigy above the rocks . The shoulders of the shirt had barely141appeared when from across the swale the big-bore Sharps boomed . Uncle Sim heard the slap of the bullet . The effigy was jerked from his grasp by the force of the slug . The next moment Uncle Sim had the barrel of his Hawkin between two rocks , and was squinting alongthe sights . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had dropped after he had fired . Uncle Sim 's gnarled old finger caressed the hair-trigger , squeezed . Another report boomed out , echoed into the far reaches of the snow-panopliedforest . The old man eased himself back , blew the trailing smoke from the muzzle of the rifle , and began rammingin another load , meanwhile humming joy-ously : " A scorpeen set on a t'rantler 's back , And chuckled in ghoulish glee , If I do n't sting that pizen son-of-a-gun , He 'll shore be a-stingin ' me ! ' " Around and around , to right , to left , the fight waged in front of the cabin . It was as if neither man hadan ounce more strength than the other . Harper 's eyesgleamed with desperation , and the color had gone from his ruddy face . Ellery 's jaws were clamped until knotsof corded muscle stood out below his ears . The men'sbreaths came short and fast . Ellery had heard the girl among the horses back ofthe cabin , and was determined to hold out at least un-142til she could escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gun . " Now we 're even ! " snarled the bandit chief . " Damn you , Bronco , I Still clutching with his left hand in order that Harper might not get his knife hand free , Ellery twisted violently with his right arm and wrenched it loose . His fist shot up , crashed against Harper 's jaw . Harper instantly jerked away his other hand . His fist cracked Ellery 's jaw . Now round and round , back and forth they fought , each with one hand free , each determined that the other should not get hold of his knife . They reined blows upon each other 's faces , upon each other 's bodies . They wrenched , twisted , squirmed . Their breaths were coming and going from between clenched teeth . Blood was trickling from each man 's nose . Then it looked as though Ellery had the more cunning , a little the more strength . Slowly he forced Harper back toward the cabin wall . Twice he tried to trip the bandit chief , but each time Harper extricated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his knife . Ellery 's momentary determination was to hold on until the girl could get away  --  if she were trying to get away . Why did n't she come ? With a savage twist Harper managed to swing about . His left fist shot in and out with the rapidity of a piston . Ellery 's fist was working as effectively . With a relentless grip Ellery slowly turned his antagonist , and again tried to force him back to the barer ground near the wall . Slowly Harper gave way143under the onslaught . He was leaning slightly backward . Ellery was pressing ahead with all his might , while with his left fist he pummeled the other man 's midriff . Ellery 's determination to end the combat proved his undoing . As he forged ahead his left foot slipped on the snow . Like a flash the bandit chief leaped aside , whirled . His hand darted to his knife . He crouched as Ellery whirled and drew his bowie . Again the fight raged , but differently now , for each man sparred , feinted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low ; swung through swift , short arcs , their long blades gleaming in the sunlight . Feinting as if for a blow with his left fist , Ellery drew Harper off his guard for an instant . Ellery 's blade flashed , cutting a deep gash across the bandit 's upper left arm and chest . With a roar Harper sprang in , wholly oblivious now of the other blade . Ellery 's knife again found flesh . Then his foot slipped , and as he fell he felt Harper 's blade pierce his chest . He pitched forward and lay upon his face . Harper uttered a triumphant grunt as he reeled back . He was taking a step forward to plunge his knife into Ellery 's back when the girl and the horse rounded the cabin corner . Nancy had not paused to saddle the sorrel . The only means she had of guiding the animal was the tie rope , which she had fashioned into a jacimo . The disheveledriding-habit was drawn up , leaving her slim legs exposed to the knees . Determination and fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted hoarsely . " Stop , damn you , stop ! " Nancy reined the horse to the right . Snow flew from before its hoofs as it headed down the trail . The girl leaned low , flailing with heels and rope end , and as she rode she took with her an indelible picture of what she had seen there in front of the cabin  --  a man lying on his face , with the snow reddening under him , anotherman with a bestial light in his eyes . With a snarl Harper lurched forward , picked a revolverout of the snow . His legs braced wide as he aimed the weapon at the back of the fleeing girl . Snow had worked into the priming cap , and the hammer fell with a harmless click . In swift succession Harper thumbed back the hammer to try the other chambers . Nancy never knew that it was the snow that saved her this time . Harper flung away the impotent revolver , staggered to the door , cursed as he grasped the logs and looked inside . He lurched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He braced his back against the wall , lifted the rifle . In the timber he caught a glimpse of the girl and the horse . He whipped up the rifle . The report echoed through the forest . " Damn her , I 'll show her she ca n't get away from Buck Harper ! " He dropped the rifle and lurched around the cabin . In a minute he was dragging his horse to the door . He staggered inside and came out lugging his saddle . The bay , famished as it was , snorted and shied at the smell of new blood , and it was only after five minutes 145 of hard work that Harper managed to get the saddle on . He picked up the rifle , dragged himself onto the horse . Uncle Sim Knight never suffered any twinges of consciencefrom having killed a man in good cause . He went across the brushy swale , climbed to the rim of rocks , and looked down at the crumpled form of Rugg . He leaned the rifle against a rock and turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above Rugg 's left eyebrow . " Jest a leetle off center , " mused Uncle Sim , " but fer the distance , and figgerin ' it had to be done quick , it war n't bad . " He felt much better now , even though his bullet had missed the meridian line of the bandit 's forehead by an inch . He started westward around the slope , determined to get a deer . " Jim 'll take keer o ' hisself , " he muttered . " Any feller what kin lie with as straight a face as him shore kin be depended on . " Near the bottom of the canyon which drained the meadow he came upon the tracks of Nugget and Arkansawin the snow , and leaned on his rifle to look down the mountainside . " I ' low I orter follow them varmints up and kill ' em both , " he muttered , " but I reckon I kin git ' em later . " He crossed the canyon , plodded up through a tangle of mountain lilac and scrub manzanita . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncle 146 Sim dropped the four-pointer with a broken neck . He did not stop to skin the buck , but with his bowie slashed the carcass in two at the loins , and slung the hind quarters over his shoulder . Gaining the ridge , he plodded up it to the rim of the meadow , where he dropped his burden in the snow . " Come back fer it later on , " he told himself . " Now I ' low I better see how things air at the cabin . " With his usual wariness Uncle Sim approached , not directly up the open , but skirting through the timber . Vague misgivings began to assail him as he saw the open door , the thin column of smoke rising from the chimney . He pressed on faster , floundering through the snow , and had about decided to appear boldly in the open when he stopped . " Hoss tracks ! " he ejaculated softly . " Drat my hide ! " He had come upon the trail of two horses in the snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron shoe . " Wal , dog-gone me ! it 's the gal ! She 's got away . Wonder if this other track 's Jim 's hoss ? " Uncle Sim 's old heart was beating fast with pride as he pictured how Ellery had killed the remaining three bandits and escaped with the girl . " I knowed that young feller could be depended on , " he muttered . " Uncle Sim Knight ai n't often mistook in men . He 's jest took the gal , and ' spects me to foller on Molly . Wal , I ' low thar ai n't no use o ' me stayin ' now . " The old man 's caution , however , did not leave him147in this moment of pride and exultation . Instead of walking into the open , he stole from pine to pine , and came upon the cabin from the rear . There he stopped to press his ear to a crack . " Stiller ' n death herself , " he said , wagging his hoary head . " Jim , he shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Now he walked boldly , but had barely rounded the corner when he stopped . His jaw dropped . A wild light came into his eyes . " He 's daid ! " he muttered slowly . " And Uncle Sim Knight , ye 're to blame fer bringin ' him to it . I shore hope yer old soul simmers in hell ! " I4CHAPTER XIVtHarper 's bullet had come so close that Nancy had heard the hiss of it . It told her that one of the men had survived the terrible fight , which one she did not know , for as she had rounded the cabin her mind had been too turbulent for her to recognize the man in the snow . Her one thought now was to get away . Up the canyon she forced the sorrel . The sun behind her was her only compass to guide her through the white forest . By it she managed to keep her face toward the west . Somewhere in that direction was safety . Tennessee , the thoroughbred , was not a horse to plod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in experiencehe made up in spirit . They were at the ridge when Nancy heard a shout . She glanced back , to see a horseman emerging from the canyon . " Tennessee , for the Lord 's sake , run ! " she called . How she wished for bare ground " underneath ! There was not a horse in all the country that could show his heels to the sorrel . From the ridge she caught a white glimpse of the narrow pass where camp had been made two mornings before . She headed for it , not in a straight line , for straight going was impossible . There were gullies , 149heads of canyons , clumps of timber and brush to be avoided . She knew that her pursuer had the advantage of following in a somewhat beaten track . Behind her Harper was raking the bay with cruel rowels , determined that she should not escape . He would kill her first . She must not reach Columbia and tell the location of the rendezvous . Harper reeled in his saddle , and the blood that dripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . Twice within the next mile he came within a hundred yards of the fleeing girl , but each time he shouted for her to halt she managed to get a little more speed out of the valiant sorrel . Once he flopped off , whipped the rifle to his shoulder and fired . It seemed that he could not miss , yet he did . He flung the rifle away and pulled himself into the saddle . They were in the narrow pass now . The towering pines had protected the earth to some extent here , and leaning low , the girl forced the sorrel to the limit of his stride . Behind her she could hear her pursuer thundering . They struck a long level where amid scattered timber the snow lay deep and untrammeled , like a sheet of alabaster . Across it she went , the soft snow flying before the sorrel 's hoofs . Twice the animal slipped and would have pitched forward but for the girl 's steadying pull on the jacimo . At times she was sorely put to keep her seat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think of it , her lighter weight partially offset the advantage Harper had in following in the trail she was breaking . Her face was grim , almost savage with the determi-150nation to escape . She would have turned and fought if she had had a weapon . She did not feel the cold , the snow , as she scraped against boughs and released it down upon her . Brush scratched her face , tore at her habit , raked her legs . She flogged the sorrel with the heels of her slim boots , beat him with the dangling rope end . Her thumping heart grew heavy as clouds shut out the sun . The blinding glare of the snow was gone . She must get her direction , and keep on into the west . She came to the brink of a mighty canyon , and for a few moments she was frantically undecided as to which way to go . At her right was a rolling white tablelapd , peopled only by towering trees . She reined about and headed diagonally across it , the sorrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on . Behind her she could still see the relentless pursuer . He was leaning over the horn of his saddle and swaying from side to side as he plied the spurs . " If I can only lose him ! " she whispered again and again . " Tennessee , run , run ! " Running was impossible . The best the valiant horse could do was a rearing , plunging gait through the snow . Down a long ridge they went , the girl almost unseated many times as the horse swerved around great pines that blocked their way . Once the sorrel 's hoofs almost flew from under him . Not long after that he went to his knees , pitching the girl over his head , but she managed to cling to the reins . She had buried her face in the snow and for a moment was half blinded . As she tried to clamber to the back of the151sorrel she saw that her pursuer was coming down the ridge less than two hundred yards behind . Uncle Sim was not a man to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess of things , but now it was time to see what could be reclaimed from the chaos . He glanced into the cabin . " Wal , by Gawd ! " he muttered . " It ai n't so clanged bad after all , two fer one . " He knew now that it was Harper who was after the girl , and this gave him no comfort . Quickly he scanned the snow . The blood spots told their own story . " Wal , he did n't git away onteched . It war knife work . I shore wish I 'd been hyar . " With fear gripping his old heart Uncle Sim turned Ellery over . The face was white and cold where it was not smeared with blood . The breast of the shirt was caked with clotting blood . Uncle Sim ripped open the shirt , and with a handful of snow cleaned the flesh . He saw an ominous puncture in the right breast . He bent his ear close and grinned savagely . " Wal , he ai n't daid yit , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stab . " He scooped up handfuls of snow , and plastered it upon the wound to chill it and stop the flow of blood if possible . Then , as if he were at a hog-butchering , he dragged the dead men out of the cabin and left them in the snow , all the time with the full realization that Harper might reappear. 152 By half dragging , half carrying the wounded man , he managed to get him into the cabin and onto one of the rude bunks . Bloody bubbles formed and broke on Ellery 's lips as his almost indiscernible breath came and went . " Thar ai n't one chance in a hundred he 'll pull through , but I got to do my dangdest fer him , " the old man soliloquized grimly . " I got him into this hyar , and I got to git him out . Uncle Sim Knight , ye allus war a old fool . Ye orter hang from the tallest danged tree in the woods if he dies . " Perhaps he was an old fool in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , and he was resourceful . Moreover , the knowledge that if Ellery died his death would be upon his head spurred the old man 's brain to redoubled activity and his old body to new strength . He cursed vehemently as he worked . He knew that the outer wound was too clean and too small to bleed profusely . The danger was inside , where the keen blade had passed through the lung . He managed to apply a rough bandage to Ellery 's breast as the wounded man lay inert , limp . It was this limpness that gave the old man hope , though that hope was faint enough . Uncle Sim barred the door lest Harper should return . He flung fuel upon the embers . Then he began a systematic search of the cabin , and presently rose from his knees holding a bottle of whiskey in each hand . To Uncle Sim this find was like manna from the skies . He smacked his lips . " Never in all my wuthless old life did I need a dram 153 like now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Track Holler , ye 're jest ' bout in . " He set one bottle upon the table , and with the blade of his bowie drew the cork of the other . Meanwhile his eyes were glowing with anticipation , and his tongue was running over his dry lips . He raised the bottle , marking with his eyes an imaginary line down to which he would drink . " Sim Knight , if thar war ever a time when ye needed a stiff snort it 's right now . " He touched the neck of the bottle to his lips , jerked it away . " Ye danged old fool ! " he growled . " If ye tech a drap o ' it yell be robbin ' him o ' a chance fer life . Air ye that low-down ? " He held the bottle so the flames would shine amber-like through it . Again he put the bottle to his lips . With his tongue he tasted the liquor , but jerked the bottle away as if the whiskey were liquid fire . With a curse he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thar , by Gawd , Uncle Sim Knight from Turkey Track Holler , ye old he-hellion , I whupped ye ! Ye ai n't to tech one drap o ' that likker till that thar boy gits well  --  if he does git well ! Ye onnerstand that ? " He poured a little of the whiskey into a tin cup , added warm water , and managed to trickle the toddy between Ellery 's colorless lips . Crouched upon his knees , the end of his beard upon the bunk , he gazed at the white face , at the tiny red bubbles forming and breaking upon the lips , and shook his head . " Jim , if ye git well ye 're goin ' to have a hell o ' a154fight . I 'll have to ask Gawd A'mighty to do what He kin . " He went outside . The sky was again leaden , and vagrant snowflakes were drifting before the southeast wind that bent the pines . Across the brow of the mountains the cloud-line was drawn again . " Knowed this hyar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thar ai n't no denyin ' them sun-dawgs . " He looked at the trampled , gory snow . He followed Harper 's bloody trail to where the remaining horses were . The trail told him a story that made his heavy heart a little lighter , for he knew that Harper was wounded . " I 'm shore glad Jim did n't let him git away onteched , " he muttered . " I knowed that boy war a fighter the minute I set eyes on him . Showed it , did n't he , the way he killed them other two ? " By the time he had loosed the horses that were left and started them along the trail Nancy and her pursuer had broken , snow was falling fast . He watched the eager animals disappear into the white murk , and muttered : " I shore hate to treat that thorerbred o ' Jim 's like that , but he 'll head fer his home range . ' Sides , next time Jim needs a hoss it 'll likely be one with wings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hailey , telling himself he would bury them later . He went back into the cabin and for a long time gazed down . Ellery lay as if dead , except for the soft rising and falling of his broad breast. 155The conviction that the storm would last for days spurred Uncle Sim to fresh effort . The wood supply was about exhausted , but before he began to replenish it he stripped the clothing from the two bodies . " Mebbe we 'll have to wear daid men 's boots afore spring , " he told himself grimly as he scraped snow over the bodies . He noticed for the first time that his moc- casins and trouser legs were soaked with snow water . He removed the moccasins and pulled on the boots he had stripped from Tex 's feet , took up the ax , and tramped to a dead tree . Each time he brought in a load of wood he went to look down at Ellery . Each time he found that the wounded man had not stirred . For hours the snow fell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was banked high against the walls of the cabin . Then he bethought himself of the hind quarters of the deer , and after making certain that Ellery needed nothing further , he took up his rifle and trudged into the storm . It was twilight when he returned to the cabin , but he approached it warily , lest Harper should have come back . Harper was not there . Until then the girl and the bandit chief had been little in Uncle Sim 's thoughts . Now they took hold with renewed fear. " 1 orter set out and track that red-haid hellion down , " he swore , " and I 'd shore do it if it war n't fer Jim hyar . " He looked down at Ellery . The wounded man was occasionally moaning softly , and the bloody bubbles were still forming and breaking on his mouth . " Even if ye got to die , Jim , I shore wish ye 'd come 156 back long ' nough fer me to tell ye how danged sorry I am fer gettin ' ye into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wag of his head . He dropped to a stool and for a long time stared into the fire , while outside the snow sifted down and the forest bent under the force of the southeaster . Time after time Nancy tried to clamber to the smooth back of the snorting , prancing sorrel , but each time she slipped back into the snow . It seemed that her muscles had turned to useless jelly . Only her mind seemed clear , and it , was filled with fear . She saw Harper round a tree a hundred yards up the ridge , heard his cruel , triumphant shout . Again she grasped the mane of the sorrel and tried to mount . The horse shied away , and Nancy was dragged along . Like a baffled animal at bay she turned now to face the inevitable . She saw that unless the man had a knife he was unarmed . She would die , but she would sell her life as dearly as her strength would permit . Harper was fifty yards away when she saw his horse stumble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . Harper , however , managed to clutch the reins and pull them over the animal 's head . Snorting wildly , the horse scrambled and plunged to its feet , shied away , but Harper clung to the bridle and was dragged for several yards before he could stop the horse . From where she stood Nancy saw the red track in the snow where the man had slid . Harper tried to scramble to his feet . It was then she noticed that his left breast and sleeve were red . She knew 157 now that the man she had seen in the snow in front of the cabin was Bronco Jim Cato . " Stop , for God 's sake , stop ! " Harper shouted . " Ca n't you see I 'm hard hit ? I wo n't hurt " She stopped , turned to look . Grim determination gripped her . It was the manifestation of the law of self-preservation . " If you are hurt , " she shouted back , " I am not to blame ! " She dragged the sorrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and standing upon the boulder and leading her horse close , she managed to mount . Snarling , cursing , baffled , Harper watched her ride away . Then he struggled to a sitting position , stripped off his bloody shirt , tore it into ribbons , and began trying to stem the flow of blood from the deep gash across his upper left arm and breast . He had only half finished when the storm broke in all its fury of wind and flying snow . Into the stinging murk Nancy rode , not knowing where she was bound . Hazily she tried to keep the biting wind on her left cheek . For hours , days it seemed , the horse plunged , plodded through the deepening drift , while all about her the great trees loomed spectral , and the wind howled through their tops like a dirge of doom . When it seemed that she could not cling to the , back of the horse another minute , so cold were her body and brain , the sorrel stopped . They had come out on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and smooth . There was a momentary break in the 158storm , and from far below flashed a glimpse of bare , brown hills . " It 's the foothill country ! " Nancy whispered . The realization that far down there were friends , fires , houses , warmed her chilled mind and body , but with the warmth there returned a vision of the wounded man she had left back in the storm . " Even if he did try to  --  to kill me , " she whispered , " I ca n't leave him . I would n't desert a dog like this . I 'll have to go back ! " Pressing her heels against the sides of the sorrel and dragging on the jacimo , she tried to pull the horse around , but the sorrel , too , had caught sight of the home country far below . With a lunge that almost unseated Nancy he took the slope , sliding , plunging , lunging , struggling to keep his balance . She clung frantically to the thick mane and leaned far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perilous descent had more than started they were amid brush and timber on flatter ground . About them the storm closed in anew . Nancy glanced up the precipitous slope . There was no returning , now. 159CHAPTER XVIt was the homing instinct in the sorrel horse that took Nancy Beaufort safely down the mountain . Tennessee , bred of the finest blood on Colonel Beaufort'splantation in the state for which he had been named , had been nurtured by the best oats and hay until he was four years old , but on the long journey across the plains he had learned to fend for himself . The only pauses he made on the perilous descent were when he flung his head aside to browse upon hazel and mountain lilac . He was always sensitive to the cold , now almost strengthless burden on his back . As for Nancy , all she could do was to cling to the mane and let Tennessee pick his own way . She was drenched to the skin and chilled to the marrow of her bones . It was in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and early twilight when Nancy discovered that they were following a trail that looked familiar . With all her strength she reined in the sorrel and stared . They were at the very spot on which she had encountered Jim Ellery , whom she now knew as Jim Cato , the notorious lone bandit of the Northern Mines . The trail was slippery , but carefully , yet with his 160swinging walk , Tennessee trod it as though conscious that a misstep might dislodge the rider . The sleet ceased , but was replaced by a chilling drizzle . Nancy crouched as she clung to the mane . " We 'll be home before dark , Tennessee , " she said through chattering teeth . " It wo n't be long till we reach the Woods Creek trail . Wo n't Father be glad to see us ? He must have been mightily worried . " Tennessee , however , was soon to show that he had another idea . He resolutely left the trail and entered a little meadow , pulling down his head to crop at the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for what seemed like hours she allowed him to feed . " You po ' thing , " she whispered . " You have n't had anything to eat for days except leaves and snow . Just you wait till I get you in the stable , Tennessee . " When she tried to pull up his head and rein him back to the trail the horse paid her no attention . Nancy hauled on the jacimo with all her feeble strength , hauled until the exertion sent a little warmth through her exhausted body . She kicked . She cajoled . But Tennessee continued to feed . At last in sheer vexation , the girl slid down the sorrel 's neck . The animal muzzled her gently aside that he might finish a good tuft of grass . " Tennessee , " she cried as she scrambled to her feet , " this is n't any way to treat a lady ! " Tennessee , however , must have figured that for the present he had done his part . He moved quickly from tuft of grass to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers Nancy managed to untie the knots of the jacimo . Then she fastened the end of the rope to a sapling , and looked about . A little log cabin was the only inviting thing . Gathering up the torn , bedraggled skirt of her habit , Nancy tottered toward it . She rapped upon the door , pounded , called . There was no answer . " There 's nobody home , " she cried in fear , for darkness was settling . " I 've  --  I 've just got to find somebody ! " Resolutely she drew the latch string . The interior of the cabin was black and gloomy , and smelled strongly of smoke and of food sometime since cooked . Nancy called again . Again there was no answer . " I do n't think anybody will care if I go in , " she faltered . " I 'm so cold I just ca n't go any farther . " She looked back at the feeding sorrel , then entered the cabin , timidly , yet with a certain resolve to fight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark corner to challenge her . Nancy did not know that she was in the cabin of Uncle Sim . She only knew that there were walls about her , and a roof over her dripping head . " If I only had a m-m-match ! " she stammered , white teeth chattering . She decided to see whether or not she could make a fire . There was plenty of wood piled against the wall . Dropping to her knees , she began scraping away the ashes from the green oak back-log Uncle Sim had banked two days before . She uttered a glad little cry as she felt warmth. 162 " It 's fire ! It 's coals ! " Within a few minutes she had a growing blaze , and sitting Turk fashion before it , she spread out her numbed hands . " U-rrr  --  u-rrrr ! " she shivered . " I did n't know I was so cold ! " Swiftly her determination to reach Columbia this night became a vague and hazy thought . She wanted only to be warm , then to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown , she herself turned and turned to the flames until the warmth of them reached her chilled bones , while the steam from her drying clothes was sucked up into the rude chimney . Meanwhile night had dropped , and about the cabin the storm wind raged . Behind it the creek brawled , muddy and noisy , through Uncle Sim 's diggings , cutting down red gravel banks , sweeping them away , to leave shining nuggets on the bedrock and in the sluices . Warmed at last , Nancy began to search for food . She found it , the remnant of a haunch of venison , some coffee , a pot of beans which she discarded after examining the mouldy film on them , a piece of stale sour-dough bread . There was a dirty knife , too , and without pausing to clean it she sliced off some venison and placed it in the black frying pan . She put some coffee in the smoke-blackened pot and from the partially filled bucket poured water upon it . Her escape , her warm shelter , the certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father , made life much brighter . She163even smiled as she smoothed the wrinkles out of her tattered habit and tried to put her soft brown hair into some semblance of form . " Coffee , meat , bread , " she mused . It did not sound like a banquet that would allay the hunger she felt . She began to search for more food , but the only thing she found was Uncle Sim Knight 's jug of " cawnjuice . " Sitting cross-legged before the fire , she drew the cork and sniffed . Her straight little nose wrinkled . " If Daddy were here , " she decided , " he 'd make me take a good toddy . " The only way Nancy had tasted whiskey had been in mild , sweet toddies and delicately flavored juleps , so when she laboriously lifted the jug and took a stiff drink it made her cough and turn red in the face . It had been hours since she had eaten , and the raw liquor struck with such shock that it set her blood to racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said humorously , " but it makes me feel so good and warm . " Then she ate rare meat from the frying pan with her delicate , dirt-smudged fingers , drank coffee from a black cup . She bit off chunks of dry bread as if she were a hungry dog . As the coffee and the food began to allay the effect of the whiskey , Nancy became impressed with the humor of her situation . She was alternately serious and smiling . " I 've been through such terrible things that I reckon it did n't hurt if I did take a little of that whiskey , " she drawled softly . " Besides , Daddy would n't care if he were here , and nobody 'll ever 164 know . " She sighed and stretched her tired arms . " I 'm so tired I could just curl up and sleep . " Dominated by the tiny mandatory part of her senses , she laid a piece of green oak on the coals and managed to scrape some embers and ashes over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Uncle Sim 's smoke scented blankets . In that delicious interval before unconsciousness she hazily compared the present with that to which she had been accustomed . Was she Nancy Beaufort , descendant of as old and aristocratic strains as ever trod the soil of the South , pampered , waited upon by darky servants , motherless at twelve but taking from her indulgent father not only his love but that which a loving mother had left ? The only hardships Nancy had ever known previous to those of the past two days had been on the coveredwagonjourney across the plains and in the mining camps , and these had been minimized by all that love and money could provide . Now she was going to sleep in a miner 's cabin , the owner of which she could not guess . Nor did she care greatly . About the time Nancy dropped into oblivion in the little cabin below snow-line Uncle Sim Knight was mixing a hot toddy . He smacked his lips as the bouquet of the whiskey wafted up into his nostrils . " Ai n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs ' er so danged bad ? " he demanded fiercely . He took the cup to the bunk and slowly trickled the stimulant between Ellery 's colorless lips . The old 165 man was sorely worried , for Ellery had not come back to consciousness . The drawn whiteness of his face told its own story of the blood he had lost . The only encouragement Uncle Sim had was the fact that the wounded man was breathing a little more strongly . " If somethin ' or other do n't set in , he may pull through . I shore wish , Uncle Sim Knight , ye had n't brung him in hyar to git stuck like he war a hawg . If that feller Harper comes back I 'm goin ' to slit his throat from one ear to t' other ! " Uncle Sim prepared for a long siege . He had taken stock of the provisions and found that , by conserving them , and killing meat occasionally , he and Ellery could exist for months if they had to . The openings between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the forest bent under the gale and snow whirled around the cabin , Uncle Sim dug dirt from the floor , mixed it to a sticky mortar with melted snow , and plastered at the chinks . As he worked he kept his ears " cocked " for a sound that would tell him of Harper 's return , for he was determined not to be surprised . Exhausted till every nerve in his wiry body tingled , he squatted before the fire and broiled a slab of meat . He drank a cup of black coffee as he munched . By this time he had decided that the bandit chief would not come back . " Nobody could find their way back in this hyar storm . I shore hope he 's done froze long afore now . That pore leetle gal , thar ai n't one chance in a million she ever got away . If Buck Harper did n't ketch up with her , the storm got her shore . " 166 Most of his thoughts , however , were for Ellery . Never once did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation . Weeks , months here in the deep snow meant no more to him than if he were down in the foothills . Husbanding the fuel , he dozed before the fire , wakingevery little while to tiptoe to the bed and listen . Toward morning he made some broth from the marrow and " bone-meat " of a venison haunch . Morning came , dawn of howling gale and swirling flakes . The snow had already banked half-way to the eaves , and the flimsy shake roof sagged under the load of it . Uncle Sim pushed open the door enough to admit of a look , and closed it again . " Snow , clang ye , " he snarled to the storm , " snow till ye git it all outen yer hide , and keep right on ! Thar never war a snowstorm old Uncle Sim Knight wuz afeared of , dang ye ! " There came a stifled cough , a moan . Uncle Sim turned quickly . " Jim , wuz it ye ? " he demanded . " Did ye want somethin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whispered a weak voice . The old man dropped to his knees beside the bunk , but instantly scrambled to his feet . He stirred the fire , put on wood . The red light fell upon Ellery 's drawn white face , reflected from his open eyes . Uncle Sim grabbed up the kettle of broth and poured some into a cup . " Ye jest git some o ' this hyar deer soup under yer ribs , Jim , " he advised as he held the cup to Ellery's167lips . " Ye ai n't hurt much , jest a pin-prick in yer off side , boy ; but ye shore must ' a ' carved that other feller plenty , from the blood on the snow . " Uncle Sim 's mind was working fast , preparing for the ques- tion he knew he must answer . Ellery could take the broth but slowly , but it seemed to give him a little strength . He tried to sit up , but the old man pushed him down , counseling : " Do n't ye be a-risin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bled plenty as ' t is . " Ellery turned his head to search the room . His eyes came back to Uncle Sim 's . " Whe-where 's Miss Nancy ? " " I war jest a-goin ' to tell ye ' bout her , Jim . I got back jest in time to help her git away . She 's safe home long afore this . Ye see it did n't snow much yistiday , Jim . " " Thank God ! " Ellery coughed . His hand found Uncle Sim 's . " You helped  --  her  --  get away ? " " I shore did , boy ! And that hellion Buck Harper , he 's up thar in the snow stiff er'n a poker ! " Uncle Sim knew that if Ellery were to recover , peace of mind was essential . " The  --  other two ? " Ellery whispered . " Daider'n door-nails , " the old man said proudly . Even this slight exertion proved too much for Ellery . He coughed up some frothy blood . Then his lids dropped , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost inaudible breathing . Then he spread a blanket on the floor close to the bed , and lay down. 168CHAPTER XVIWhen Nancy awoke it was to a strange feeling of unreality . Her face was hot , her body filled with aches and soreness . She saw four walls , and on them objects she hazily remembered from the previous night , a suit of buckskin , some sacks containing various articles . The little light that came in through the small window showed her it was day , but the steady drip-drip from the eaves and the roar of the creek told that the storm had not abated . Gradually out of the daze she oriented herself . She jumped from the bunk and knelt before the warm embers . With shaking hands she raked the ashes from the coals in the fireplace and soon had a blaze leaping into the chimney . Strangely it did not seem to warm her , though her body felt as if it were on fire . Her teeth chattered as with a chill . The thought of food was repugnant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wonder if it was that liquor made me feel this way ? " she asked herself . She put the jug under the bunk to get it out of sight . As though in a cloud she recalled the immediate past , but her escape , her harrowing experiences169strangely lacked terror . Home , her father seemed unreal and far away . " I wonder what 's the matter with my head ? " she asked herself . " I must have slept too hard . " She pulled open the door . A cold rain was falling . The forest moaned under the gloomy weight of the wind . The horse was huddled in the lee of some trees . Nancy looked up at the soggy sky , but saw nothing to tell her the time of day . Vaguely she felt that it must be late . Colonel Beaufort had all but given up hope . His searchers had combed every foot of the forest and grassy hills within a radius of ten miles . The colonel had aged two decades in as many days . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left its marks in his eyes and under them . His usually meticulous black broadcloth hung without fit on a body that was stooped and weary . For two days the colonel had eaten practically nothing , and though accustomed to taking his whiskey temperately he had drunk inordinate quantities of it , yet somehow it had been without the power to stimulate . For hours on end he sat in the lobby of the Columbia House , mechanically acknowledging the sympathy of his friends as he looked with hopeless gaze out into the rain-drenched world or sat with his chin on his chest , his eyes closed as they tried vainly to conjure a picture that would tell him Nancy was safe . The colonel was sitting thus in the late afternoon 170 when a man burst into the hotel and stared wildly about until his eyes rested upon the hopeless figure by the stove . " Colonel ! " he shouted . " Colonel Beaufort ! There 's somebody comin ' down the road ! It kinder looks like your gal ! " As if by magic the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fine old face . The colonel 's shoulders braced back as he leaped to his feet . He grasped the messenger by the shoulders and shook him savagely . " What is it , suh ? What 's this you 're saying ? " " There 's somebody comin ' down the street on a sorrel hoss , Colonel . It kinder looks like your Ten- nessee . " " Thank you , suh , " the colonel gasped , " thank you kindly ! " By the time he was at the door the other men from the lobby were close behind . The colonel was the first to speak as they squeezed out to the plank walk . " Nancy ! " he whispered . " Thank God ! " It was Nancy , and the sorrel was bringing her home . Drenched , her wet hair about her face and shoulders , she was clinging to the sorrel 's mane as the animal came down the middle of the street from the east . There rose a tremendous shout from the score of onlookers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been heralded before , for everybody had been indoors . As for Nancy , she dimly heard the cheer , saw the group in front of the little hotel . It was home , yet home a thousand miles away . She tried to171feel a little exultation , tried to smile , but her hot face refused to break its fixed , stoical calm . Hazily she saw her father running forward . " Nancy , my girl , my girl ! " the colonel cried as he reached up his arms . Nancy tried to straighten , to get hold of even a little of her innate dignity and sweetness , but all she managed was a hysterical laugh . She slid limply into her father 's arms . He kissed her again and again on the hot face . " Daddy , " she whispered , " I 'm  --  I 'm home . I did n't mean to be gone so " There , there , honey ! " His voice was husky and trembling . " Do n't you mind . Do n't try to explain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who wanted to take her from his arms , but he would have none of their help . " Thank you , gentlemen . I am quite able to carry her . She will be much more comfortable this way , gentlemen . " Up the narrow stairs he bore her , but not until he had told the clerk to summon Mrs. Gaines , the housekeeper , and Dr. Clampett , the best physician in town . Mrs. Gaines was already in the rear guard of the crowd that mounted the stairs , and at the top she forced past to open the sitting-room door of the three-room suite occupied by the colonel and his daughter . Staggeringand panting , the colonel laid the girl upon the little couch . He stooped to kiss her before he said : " Honey , do n't try to explain anything . There 's plenty of time . " He was worried for he had felt the 172 hotness of her face , seen the feverish light in her eyes . She stretched her arms languidly toward him , then uttered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest  --  I am . " Colonel Beaufort closed the door gently , explaining that there was nothing the curious onlookers could do . By the time Mrs. Gaines had the girl disrobed , Dr. Clampett bustled in with his black bag that was almost as much a part of him as his raven-black whiskers . He worked briskly , pausing now and then to listen to the girl 's first delirium , or to glance up at her drawn-faced father . Cold and drenched , Nugget and Arkansaw trudged into town about dark . Despite their hunger and fatigue they had lost none of their determination to make no slip in the collection of the **26;1584;TOOLONG . " Fust we got ta have some likker , " drawled Arkansawas they slouched toward the main street . He was tall , awkward , lantern-jawed . His long black mustachedropped in melancholy fashion at each side of his jutting chin , which was usually stained with tobacco-juice . Nugget was short , stocky , with a barrel-like body and a round , red face . His little blue eyes were set close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fer a bottle of raw likker right now , " he agreed . Heading for the Pay Dirt saloon , they found it packed with men , all of whom seemed unusually ex-I731cited . No attention was paid to the newcomers . They might have been two miners in from the diggings , or two of the more persistent of the searchers Colonel Beaufort had sent out . By the time Nugget and Arkansaw had taken their second drink they had begun to realize the cause of the excitement . They edged to the end of the long bar next the wall . Surprise was not all there was in their eyes as they regarded each other . " The gal 's back ! " Nugget whispered . " What do you make of it , Ark ? " " Wal , by Gawd ! " Arkansaw whispered back . " It shore sounds that away ! Somethin ' must ' a ' went wrong ! " " Listen to what that feller 's sayin ' , " counseled Nugget . After taking another drink , they mingled with the noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they took their places at the end of the bar , there to talk in low tones . " What you figger we better do ? " Nugget demanded . " Hell must ' a ' popped somehow ! " " Wal , " Arkansaw drawled viciously , " the gal 's back . If we-all go back to camp without the money , Buck , he 'll kill us shore , that is if he ai n't daid . Bet that old Hedgehog and the feller with him was at the bottom of this here . There wo n't be no danger in stayin ' here , though , for a while . Nobody knows us . Do n't let that likker git to talkin ' , Nugget . " " And do n't you , " snarled Nugget . " This here 's ticklish. " 174 Bill Yerkes , the deputy , after his fruitless ride to Rancho Linda Vista , had hurried back to Columbia . He was one of the first men outside the hotel to learn of Nancy 's return . He immediately galloped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had returned to his office earlier in the day . Yerkes had traveled less than half the four miles when he met Warren , who was riding back to Columbia to follow a clue he had picked up . Leaving Yerkes in the lobby of the Columbia House , Warren ran up the stairs . Colonel Beaufort , white of face and with anguished eyes , answered his knock . " Howdy , suh , " he whispered . " She 's a very sick girl , I fear . " Dr. Clampett was sitting near the bed , the girl 's wrist in his hand . His face was grave . " She must have had some terrible experiences , Sheriff , " the colonel whispered . " She 's out of her head . " " Then she has n't told much ? " queried Warren . " I 'd hoped she might give us somethin ' to work on . " For perhaps a minute the girl lay still . Then suddenlyshe flung an arm wide . Her voice rose shrill , half insane . Her laugh made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , those men ! " she cried . " The one with the black mustache made me laugh , frightened as I was . He had the funniest , the very funniest mustache I ever saw , and there was a streak of tobacco  --  tobacco-juice right down his chin . He had such a funny chin ! He " Her voice trailed off in a weird laugh. 175Colonel Beaufort dropped to his knees and took her hand from the doctor . He held it tenderly , while with his other hand he stroked her hot brow . " Which men were they , honey ? " he asked softly . " Do n't excite her , " the doctor warned . " It 's mere delirium , sir . " " She may tell somethin ' that 'll help us catch the damned skunks , Doc , " interposed the sheriff . The girl was staring through fever-glazed eyes . " Which men ? " she repeated angrily . " Why , the men that captured me on the trail , Daddy . I 've told you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just had to laugh at the tall one 's mustache , and the dirty streak of tobacco-juice down his chin . And the other one " Yes , the other one , dear ? " queried her father . " I 've forgotten what you said he looked like . " With her free hand she reached out and grabbed her father 's long , silvery hair . " Colonel Beaufort ! " she cried angrily . " You just listen to me while I 'm talking , and do n't be asking questions over and over ! Understand ? " " Yes , honey , I understand , but I did n't quite catch your description of the other man . Was he tall or short ? " " He was short ! " she cried fiercely . " He was short , and his red face was round like the moon . Round like the moon , and he had round little eyes , like a pig I saw once back in Tenn  --  Tenn " Presently Warren descended to the lobby , where he found Yerkes. 176 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Clampett says she 'll likely be that way for days . All she could talk about was the men that caught her in the trail , Bill . I sure wish she was in her right mind . " Yerkes had had some experience with delirious persons , and knew that their mutterings and wordpictureswere often accurate . " Did she say what these two fellers looked like , Sam ? " " Yeah , " the sheriff chuckled . " From what she said I can fairly see ' em . Let 's mosey round town . There ai n't one chance in a thousand , though , they might be here . " Perhaps it was fate that guided their footsteps to the Pay Dirt saloon . On the way from the hotel Warren had repeated much of the girl 's raving to Yerkes . Just inside the saloon they stopped to survey the excited crowd . Their eyes roved over it till they came to rest on the two men next the wall at the end of the bar . Sheriff and deputy stiffened as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a man with a round face and piggy eyes ! The four men drew their guns simultaneously , and as the big room reverberated with the shots Bill Yerkes dropped his revolver and pitched forward . Arkansaw crumpled up and slid off the bar-rail . Nugget , with an empty gun , leaped convulsively , and dropped to the floor , Warren 's last bullet through his heart . With the two emissaries who had come to collect the ransom , died the one hope of locating the bandit camp. 177 CHAPTER XVIIThere was in the great mining town another physician of note , one Johann Schkoff , a cultured and learned man . Once , while in a confidential state due to too much liquor , Dr. Schkoff had proclaimed that he was a graduate of Vienna , and that he had at one time been connected with the medical staff of the Hapsburg throne . There was no way of proving this , but as the gold discovery had brought men from every class , from every quarter of the civilized world , it was not improbable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinarily , high boots , and a long smock belted down , but at rare intervals he donned the conventional broadcloth . With this transformation he became a courtier and a gentleman , and looked like an archduke . For his aristocratic bearing and his look , the miners had dubbed him the " Duke . " The Duke was never particular about his fee . Often it was no more than a drink or a bottle of whiskey , occasionally a few ounces of gold-dust . When Dr. Clampett realized the gravity of Nancy Beaufort 's condition he suggested to the colonel that Dr. Schkoff be called in. 178 " Do as you like , " replied Colonel Beaufort , " but do it quickly . If it is a question of money Dr. Clampett knew it was not a question of money . He might set a fee in the thousands as easily as in the hundreds . Besides being rich when he had come to the mines , Colonel Beaufort had obtained considerablevaluable mining ground , and was only waiting for the completion of the long ditch from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . So the Duke was called into the sick room . He came partially drunk . A peasant he appeared in his boots and smock , until one looked at his face . It was the face of a scholar , intelligent , refined , grave , even though the Duke did have to suppress a hiccough . His . tapered white fingers felt the girl 's pulse with meticulous care , rested on her hot forehead , rolled back her lids so that he might look into the unseeing eyes . " Miss Beaufort is a very sick young lady , " he announced . " I fear she will be ill for a long time . We shall have to guard against pneumonia , but more to save her mind , I fear . " " Good God , suh ! " the colonel cried , aghast . " Do you mean my daughter may come out of this insane ? " " Be calm , Colonel , " admonished the Duke . " What I have suggested is a possibility , not a certainty . We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel , as to give me a drink if you have it handy ? " Dr. Clampett was for bleeding to relieve the fever and the delirium , but Schkoff disagreed vehemently. 179
