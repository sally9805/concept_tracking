The elevator in Paris ' Hotel Meurice is frivolous . It looks as much like a gondola as an elevator can . Into it one evening last week stepped two aged Britons-Neville Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax . They alighted at an upper floor and proceeded to the suite of the man who used to be their King-Emperor , now His Royal Highness , the Duke of Windsor . <P> The Duchess of Windsor , the thrice-married lady for whose love Edward VIII abdicated , is not Her Royal Highness . She is merely the 29th and lowest Duchess in the realm , a fact which annoys the Duke . It seems to him that the royal family's- particularly the royal ladies ' - attitude toward the Duchess is needlessly punitive . He also resents the moral indignation raised against the Duchess by that class of English ladies so well represented by Lucy Baldwin , wife of the Prime Minister who pressured him off the throne . With his chin well out , the Duke was said to have introduced his lady to their visitors as " Her Royal Highness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary acknowledged , but scarcely confirmed this title with a bow . Later Paris socialites , abuzz over this first meeting since the abdication between the Duke and top-rank British officials , speculated whether the Ministers had thus tacitly recognized the royal status of the Duchess . <P> After 22 minutes of talk , during which the four reportedly agreed that the " exiled " Duke would return to England in January , he and his lady in March , that he might take on some governor-generalship . Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Halifax withdrew . They returned to the British Embassy where their ladies had been awaiting them .
