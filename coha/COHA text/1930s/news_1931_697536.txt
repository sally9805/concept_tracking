txt The financial condition of the industry probably is the most encouraging aspect of the 1930 results . Close control has been kept over inventory , and cash holdings have been steadily increased . The industry is practically without bank debt . It now is in position to move forward confidently . Dealer Situation Improved A great deal of constructive work has been accomplished by leading companies , and many lessons have been learned which should aid in bringing about greater stabilization in the industry . The outstanding feature of the year has been the improvement in the dealer situation . Many weak accounts have been eliminated , but the motor companies out of their experience with dealer problems of the past year have learned a great deal more about the retail end of their business . Such information will place the industry in a position to avoid past mistaken and more accurately tr gauge its markets . The automobile industry began its 1930 campaign auspiciously , but lost momentum shortly before the middle of the year . For eight months . it has been undergoing steady contraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced in more than a decade . Just before the automobile shows at the beginning the year , it had her predicted generally that the high level of output attained in 1929 would not be approached in the 3930 ye - in The industry was emerging from a period of rapidly declining outzit covering the final half of 1929. and looked forward to a fairly normal volume of business in the new year , variously estimated at from 4,000,000 to 4,500,000 units . The stock market collapse late in 1929 found a noticeable recession in automobile production under way . It followed a new high monthly record of 663,811 cars and trucks produced in April of 1929 . In the general uncertainty which accompanied financial ano business disruption , the motor industry undertook to retrench still further and brought output in December of 1929 to the low level of 125,502 cars and trucks fit the United States and Canada . False Start At Year 's Beginning Production recovered sharply , however , at the beginning of 1930 .

The rapid acceleration in production during the first few months of the year , however , proved a false start . The unfavorable condition which developed subsequently in the industry is attributed to the excessive optimism generated by Its apparently rapid return to normalcy early in 1930 . For the past eight months , output has declined month by month to levels which have not been seen for many years . In the final quarter of the year , operations were down to an annual rate approximately equal to 1916 , the year in which automobile production in this country first crossed the annual total of 1,000.000 units . Including an estimate for December , the full year 's production probably will be short of 3. - 500,000 cars and trucks . with about 2,900,000 of the total in passenger cars and 570,000 in commercial vehicles . Thus , both branches of the industry have shown a substantial recession . from the record output of 5,621,715 units in 1929 . Of the 1929 total , 4.777.309 units were cars and 844,406 were commercial vehicles . The decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in trucks 32% . Medium Priced Clean Suffers Most Aside from the general recession In sales during 1930 , numerous cross-currents developed within the industry . A heavy sales decline in the medium priced class , particularly around 51,000 and slightly under , reacted against the volume producers in that category , who experienced the most severe contraction in business . Sales of the highest and lowest priced cars also decreased , but the business volume in those fields was larger in relation to the total than in the preceding year . In the lowest priced field , including Ford and Chevrolet , business held above the average for the industry . Segregating output , according to price class , the lowest priced field did 84.2'o of the total in 1930 against 81% in 1929 . Me , dium priced cars accounted for only 14.3%. 1 against 17.7% in 1929 , and the high priced models accounted for 1 5 " i-. against ** The showing by Ford and Chevrolet explains the favorable results of the lowest price group . The Chevrolet volume in 1930 was about 24 " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ford Motor Co ' s business volume duraig first six months of the past year was at levels close to the highest records shown by that company . It was not until after the turn of the year that Ford business began to slump rapidly . During the closing months , it was apparent that the Ford market was feeling the recession in demand as keenly as any other market in the industry . Nevertheless , Ford 's output for the year accounted for about 42% of the total In 1930 against 35% in 1928 . Inventory Position Strongest In Years New model considerations have loomed large in affecting output during the final quarter of the year . Many manufacturers . finding that the Spring business was not up to earlier expectations , immediately placed sharply reduced schedules into effect to enable dealers to liquidate accumulated stocks of unsold cars . That process has been successful and placed the field inventory in its strongest position in many years At the close of the year , unsold cars in the hands of dealers and factories were at the lowest level in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars was a feature of 1930 's business . Some estimates in the trade suggest that the total volume of used car transactions exceeded 7 , - 000.000 units , or two used units for every new unit sold . Considerable of the turnover came from stocks accumulated by dealers under pressure to move new models in 1929 . The price situation was unsettled the greater part of the past year with a pronounced movement to lower levels A wide divergence of opinion concerning prices existed early in the year , with some manufacturers advancing lists and others offering lower prices . In later months , however , the general tendency was toward sharply reduced prices , particularly on 1931 models , to attract buyers . It reflected substantial economies in manufacture , under stress of steadily diminishing sales . Sales Volume *2,200,0041,000 Estimated Trade estimates place the total volume of business last year at around $2,200,000,000 which would compare wit ! ? a volume of *3,576 , - 645,881 in 1929. and which represents the lowest volume since 1922 when sales aggregated $1 , - 793,022,708 .
