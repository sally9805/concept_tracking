txt Conservative estimates are that the ti . S. Steel Corp . will show net profit in the quarter ended March 31 , last , of between $32,000,000 and 835,000,000 . This would be equal to approximately $3 to $3.25 a share on the 8,560,676 shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the period , after deducting dividend requirements on preferred stock for the three months . The report will be published after the close ot business Tuesday . Predictions had been made in the financial district that the corporation would show as much as $3.50 a share or more for the first quarter . In the final quarter of last year the corporation reported net profit of 539.972.348 , equal to 54.14 a share on the 5,132,840 shares of common then outstanding , after preferred dividend deductions . The first quarter of 1929 recorded a net profit of 542.185,447. or $5.04 a share on the 7,116.235 shares of common outstanding atter preferred dividend needs . There has been an increase of 1,444,641 shares of common outstanding since the end of ; the first quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bond retirement plan called for an offering of more than 3,000 000 shares to common holders at $140 a share , as well as to the payment of about 260,000 shares for the Columbia Steel properties and 180,000 shares for the Atlas-Portland Cement Co . Bond Bodemption Aided The fact that the Steel Corporation will be able to show as much as $3 25 a common share in the first quarter of this year . when business was materially curtailed , can be attributed to the bond retirement plan devised by Myron C. Taylor . chairman of the finance committee . With the bonds of the parent corporation entirely eliminated , and with some of the indebtedness of the subsidiaries materially reduced , the corporation will be able to make a comparatively good snowing for the common stock even in periods when business falls off . Many realized when the bond redemption plan was proposed that this would aid the position of the common shareholders when consummated . Few , however , expected the benefits to be shown conclusively so soon . The recession in business preceding the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which increased after the slump in securities , has emphasized the wisdom of the bond retirement plan . With the bonds out of the way and interest charges , premium on bonds redeemed and sinking fund chu : . rges eliminated , it is not necessary for the total earnings of the corporation to be as large as formerly to make a good showing for the junior stock . The fact that the management will no longer make deductions for amortization of good will also is an important factor for future advantage of holders of the junior shares . Other Plans Coming At present the Steel Corporation has approximately $200,000,000 appropriated for expanding and improving plants . This outlay will bring about a reduction of costs in the long run , although the benefits will not be felt until the large amount of work under consideration has been carried out . However . officials are firm In the view that these plans will be beneficial and the various steps taken from time to time are of vast importance to stockholders . Considerable significance can be attached to the intensive study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the various producing properties of the corporation with the view to Lliminating those not ideally situated for obtaining supplies of raw materials or taking care of the consuming markets . V.-here such conditions are found to exist , the plants will be abandoned gradually and the properties sold This kill result in the concent-ation of operations in the better-located plants . with a saying in costs of freight in and out of the mills , as well as in the manufacture of the various steel articles . It will take so is time before this study has been completed , but officials of the corporation have been v:slting the mills with regularity in recent months indicating that the matter is being given great consideration and study . Prices I. astable It is probable that the Steel Corporation would have made an even more favorable showing in the first quarter of this year if the price situation had been more satisfactory . There were times when stability was entirely lacking in the price structure . Concessions were granted freely by some of the smaller concerns . particularly when the demand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . At the beginning of tfit : current month the Steel Corporation announced a reduction of a ton in quotations for steel tubular goods . mainly because of the shading which had been in progress . This step was taken in an effort to bring about stability in these products , and it is known that Officials of the corporation wit , take similar action on other products when eonclitionq become so lin- , ettled that a sharp : eduction is considered to be justified . Those directing- the price policy of I : is : Steel have been slow in following the oncesFIC:IIS which have been made by competitots in toe past Only when customers reported their ability to secure products at lower than tnc regular market quotations has the corporation been willing to meet the reduced prices . This has been deemed necessary in order to hold customers in fine , and it would not be surprising if officials decided upon a more commanding position regarding prices in the coming months to bring about stability .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
