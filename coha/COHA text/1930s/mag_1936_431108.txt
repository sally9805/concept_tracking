IWORE my engagement ring 24 hours before it made place for the wedding band . The day before the ceremony I was teaching in a small-town high school , and five days later we were on the Atlantic Ocean . I had known the man I married since our own high school days . We had gone to the same university , and both of us had earned nearly all our expenses . At the beginning of my second year of teaching , K. still had his fifth year in fine arts ahead of him . He had a few hundred dollars of college debts and would have more before the year was over . We hoped to be married eventually , but only Providence knew when . Then , suddenly , K. was offered a fellowship of $Soo toward a year of study in Italy . It was too great an opportunity to miss , but if he took it he would need to borrow a good sum in addition , with no assurance of when or how he could pay it back . The hypothetical date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need n't tell you what would have been the sane and sensible thing for us to do . Our parents told us very clearly and without embellishment . So did our solid and successful friends . But there were other friends with a streak of madness in their natures who said , " You should n't do this , but , if you 're bound to anyhow , we 'll back you up . " The school board released me and found a substitute . Then our parents said , " You 'll live to regret it , but , since there 's no stopping you , we 'll lend you all the money we have . " So we took a chance . ADVENTURE IN POVERTY WHATEVER the future is keeping for us , nothing can take away the memory of that year . There are people who can see no romance in traveling the cheapest class on boats and trains , where one often sits next to peasants with live hens in their laps ; in cooking over charcoal fires , bathing in washbowls , living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debts . But those people have always been smothered in material comforts . We were both farm-bred and we knew what it meant to work for fourteen hours a day at anything the farm demanded , to eat simple fare and to like it . So when we arrived in Florence we took a studio apartment in one of the oldest and dirtiest parts of the city and we scrubbed for a week on our hands and knees to get down to the native brick of our floors , beneath the dirt . We had a fireplace that always smoked , a tin can of a wood stove , a stone sink with a cold-water tap above it , and a charcoal stove for cooking . We always had to fan the charcoal fire for half an hour from the time it was lighted until it condescended to burn . Then a fine coating of ash dust settled impartially on every object in the apartment . We had for a total weekly food budget the equivalent of five American dollars . We agreed that whatever we could save from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each week we saved two dollars and one week we saved three . On that allowance we neither starved nor suffered but we did eat quantities of such plebeian things as corn-meal mush , vegetable stew , and big loaves of Italian bread . We noticed that in restaurants even the poorest-dressed laborers spent nearly as much for wine as they spent for food . We had a cheaper system . We skipped the wine and drank water . American friends whom we met in Florence exclaimed at the things we had bought to take back home . " We should love to get some , too , " they would say , " but we simply ca n't afford it . " Yet whenever they went to a place more than a block away they took a taxi . We walked or took a tram for four cents . Each afternoon , they dropped into a shop for cakes and tea and left enough cash behind them to feed us for three meals . We still have the linen , the pottery , the leather work , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the taxis and the tea . When we gave up our studio in the spring , we traveled over the length and breadth of Italy while K. sketched and we visited museums and nosed about the country . We spent a month in France and then came home , in perfect health and with heads full of news . We saw and heard as much as if we had registered at the best hotels and we probably smelled more . We developed a sixth sense for picking the least expensive lodgings and restaurants and a sheer genius for smuggling into our rooms bread , cheese , radishes , and fruit and for consuming it and leaving no trace . That is n't done , of course , but we did it . In fact , we attribute any success of ours to doing the things that are n't being done . WHAT YOU CAN Do WITHOUT WHEN WE arrived home in America , K. found awaiting him a letter offering a graduate fellowship of $soo , $loo of which would go for tuition . $400 was not a stupendous sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was better than nothing , so we took it . We found a small room for $5 a week . This sum paid , too , for the privilege of cooking on a corner of our landlady 's kitchen stove and of eating on a corner of her kitchen table . I did our laundry on my knees before a bathtub in her cellar . K. sold $600 worth of paintings and etchings that year , but we used only $300 of it to add to our original $400 for living expenses . We applied the other $30o to our debts . The next summer K. was given a job as instructor in his college at $2,000 a year . Even in those boom times it looked to us like a million . That was seven and a half years ago . Since then , we have both earned our Master 's degrees ; we have paid off all our first debts with six-per-cent interest ; we have bought , furnished , and equipped a house , collected a 5oo-book library , and have increased our family to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from electrically fitted kitchen to glass-tiled bathroom is paid for , and the payments on our house are over half made . Yet , owing to the depression , K. 's winter- and summer-School salaries combined are still below the $3,000 mark , and his sales for drawings and paintings rarely cover the cost of his materials . All around us we see faculty members , with better salaries than ours , perpetually broke , crabbing about the depression , and complaining that they ca n't live on their reduced incomes . To be perfectly accurate , they never could live on their incomes before they were reduced . Yet there is no magic in our system . Anyone in the same circumstances could have done the same or better . We simply decided what we wanted most , did without things when it was necessary , and gave up lesser things in order to secure greater . For the three years before we could afford our electric stove , I did all of my cooking on a two-burner oilstove that a friend was about to throw away . Before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture that we bought for a song at auctions and then painted , cleaned , and repaired . When our first son was born , our initial debts were only half paid . The doctor said , " Why do n't you go into the maternity ward ? You 'll get perfectly adequate care . " The price of a bed in the ward was about half that of a private room . So I went into the ward , and my friends were horrified . They could n't imagine bringing forth a baby without engaging , in addition to a private room , the services of a private nurse for at least two weeks . I have never had a private nurse , and both the youngsters and I have survived as well as the friends with the staggering maternity bills . THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE MACHINE AGE A PERSON 'S standard of living is a fine and pleasant affair as long as he is master of it . Palatial bathrooms , streamlined motors , electrical magic workers , oil burners , beauty parlors , silk lingerie , fur coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their points . But people often forget that these things are not necessary to sustain life or even happiness . Their standard of living becomes for them a monster that has them by the throats . I am not trying to belittle the depression . I have seen too much evidence of the tragedies it has made . But in many cases the tragedies came not so much from the depression as from the softness that prosperity had fostered . Sally and Bill , two friends of ours , had been very much in love for several years . Sally 's parents had a fairly hard time in their youth , and the mother insists that her children must never go through the same . When the depression came , Bill 's business suffered along with everybody else 's , but he still had enough income to supply the necessities . Sally 's parents finally broke up the match and convinced her that she would find only misery in a life of poverty . She is now teaching school on a comfortable salary and has put away all thoughts of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusual case ; it is rather an average one . On every side , we hear young people say , " I guess we 'll have to put off our wedding forever . We could n't begin to live on Jim 's salary . " Even philosophers find it difficult to live on incomes of zero , and many young people without jobs and with too much pri:i to be supported by charity must find marriage impossible . But for many others it is not a question of marrying on an invisible income . It is that of marrying and managing on an income smaller than their standard of living permits . Most of their incomes even today are larger than their great-grandparents ever achieved . But living and fighting for existence and success together seem to have lost their charm when weighed against electric refrigerators and shock-absorbing motorcars . Mary , whom I knew in college , was engaged to a man who insisted that they could not be married until he was earning at least $5,000 a year . She broke the engagement , finally , and married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has three children now , does all her own work , and regrets nothing . The college fiance got caught in the depression and is still struggling on alone toward the $5,000 goal . The Bronsons , who resented the notoriously high rents of a university town , bought an old farmhouse a mile out in the country . There were only wood stoves to warm the rooms ; there was no electricity and no plumbing . They installed a gasoline pump and secured the plumbing but they still have to light the house with kerosene lamps and cook on a wood range . Nine out of ten of the people who have commented on their venture say , " How can they ever live with no furnace and no elec-tricity ? " Yet these same people are forever complaining because they ca n't get ahead . They buy sweetbreads at 8o cents a pound , saying that it really is n't extravagant because there is no , waste . That also applies to Hamburg at fifteen cents a pound , but they would be insulted if you told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it 's " really cheaper " than to let their old car reach the point where it needs repairs . Our modest six-year-old buggy has cost us in those six years less than a third the car expenditures of these neighbors . Even day laborers have forgotten such simple arts as that of walking . One Saturday noon , a young man who had been installing our furnace asked to use the telephone . He called his sister downtown and said , " I hate to have you wake Jim , but I 'm way out at Forest Home . Could he drive out and get me ? " Jim was a night watchman who slept in the daytime . We live a mile from the streetcar line . I had regularly walked that mile four times a day when I was taking work at the college . The streetcar would have taken him to the center of town or beyond for eight cents , and if he had n't the eight cents he had the afternoon before him and could have walked down in half an hour . Friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you live way out in Forest Home . You must have to drive to class . " He walks the distance in twelve minutes . These same friends play golf for exercise . A student who had been a track man in prep school was planning to enter our college . His mother investigated for him the rooming situation . She finally turned down the offer of a very good room because it was half a mile from the campus and her son could n't walk that distance to classes . Some of my friends shamefacedly wear silk stockings with runs in them during their mornings at home , in order to cut their stocking bills . I brazenly wear cotton stockings , without runs in them , during those same mornings . It is a dark secret , but cotton and lisle stockings are still extant , and they wear several times as long as silk ones . They do n't look as trim or as plutocratic , but , between a silk stocking with runs and a cotton stocking without , I prefer the latter . My stocking bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOMETIMES YOU PAY FOR HAPPINESS ALLL THESE are little things , but they add up into startling totals and often they spell the difference between contentment and despair . If a person becomes so tied to material comforts and labor savers and luxuries that he is miserable without them , he ceases to be a free man . He can never dare take a big chance for happiness , because of fear for his standard of living . John and Olive , an engaged couple , have had everything they could desire from the time they were babies . Then the depression took away the incomes of both their families . John , a college graduate , has a job at $2o a week . They have decided to get married on that and to live on it . I pity those youngsters , not because it ca n't be done but because they are so utterly unprepared for it . They spend money as naturally and as often as they breathe . Whether they can laugh when the money runs low and stretch it to cover their greatest needs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a miracle if they can . A while ago I overheard a negress coaxing her errand-boy husband to give her his last dollar to buy frosted corn on the cob ( in January ) for their supper . She got the dollar . Relief workers tell of women on relief taking money allotted for food to buy permanent waves , of families destitute of clothing and furniture but with electric refrigerators in the kitchens , of boys using their only few dollars to pay first installments on cars and fill them up with gasoline , of men on $ i 5-a-week salaries buying their wives diamond rings for Christmas on the plan of $1 down and 5o cents a week . Such instances seem absurd or pathetic in people of such circumstances , but they are merely illustrations of a good American tradition that finds plenty of illustration in ditch diggers , clerks , stenographers , college professors , the directors of big business , and whomever else you can think of . If people can have their fur coats , their electric gadgets , their streamlined cars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever else they need for happiness , they will all live pleasant and comfortable lives . They may get a little bored , at times , and disillusioned because they can find nothing new to give them a thrill but they will never be inconvenienced by kerosene lights or weary of washing clothes on their knees before tin bathtubs . But , if their budgets are small and they want something as absurdly romantic as marriage , a home and family , they must be willing to pay what it costs . When money comes , if it ever does , people who have chosen to share such experiences know precisely what money is worth and what it is n't worth , what it can buy and what it can never buy . They will tell you that the game is worth the candle and that they have never been bored .
