Since President Manuel Azaa of Spain was almost hourly expected to flee from Madrid , the Mexican Congress last week sent a message of sympathy addressed " to the President of Spain wherever he may be . " This arrived as the President was sitting in his small office at the Palacio National in Madrid , declaring that " The Spanish Republic will maintain political and religious liberty ! " The Spanish Republic was actually at its last gasp and the President 's wife had fled to the seaport of Alicante , haven for refugees from Madrid . There she was taking care of child victims of Spain 's civil war with the help of the two daughters of enormous Socialist Indalecio Prieto , Minister of Air and Marine . Also in Alicante , but as prisoners of the Radical Madrid Government , were Fascist Leaders Jos Antonio Primo de Rivera and his brother Miguel , wild-eyed sons of Spain 's late Dictator . The Berlin Government was so concerned last week about Jos 's welfare that a German officer was sent to his cell each night to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been executed . <P> With increasing despair the Radical Government saw the White Army battle its way within sight of Madrid . To meet the impending crisis Premier Francisco Largo Caballero was appointed " Supreme Chief of the Military Forces of Spain " and Julio Alvarez del Vayo " General Commissioner of War , " in a two-way attempt to exercise political control over the Red Militia . As the White offensive rolled nearer &; nearer to the capital , Madrid became a city of gloom and darkness . Gas for cooking and heating had been cut off . Places of entertainment closed early . To stir up the inhabitants ' flagging spirits notices were pinned up in the streets , " Men of Madrid ! Will you allow your women to be raped by Moors ! " The women themselves were similarly exhorted by Communist Deputy Doa Dolores ( " The Passion Flower " ) Ibarruri , who pleaded : " Women of Madrid ! Do not hinder your husbands from going to War . It is better to be the widow of a hero than the wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately did little to stimulate the government 's militia , largely composed of ill-trained , ill-disciplined shoemakers , cabdrivers and waiters who were only prevented from scattering in despair by their officers standing behind them with cocked firearms . At San Martn-de-Val de Inglesias , 7,000 Reds vainly attempted to repulse 1,000 Whites , made it easy for White Generalissimo Francisco Franco 's armies to resume their march on Madrid . <P> This-week President Azaa and three Cabinet Ministers , whether or not they had " fled " from Madrid , arrived unexpectedly at Barcelona and drove about this Mediterranean seaport , cheered by its radical populace .
