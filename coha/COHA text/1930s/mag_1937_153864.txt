Cartoonist Harold Gray , creator of Little Orphan Annie , has little trouble getting his character into direly complicated situations . Last week the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate , which features Annie , was in an awkward spot itself . Annie had just been saved by benevolent Arunah Blade from unscrupulous Brittlewit who had previously adopted Annie , insured her for $100,000 , and then shoved her in the river . Benefactor Blade , explaining how Brittlewit had been able to take out the huge policy , said last week : " OF COURSE , THERE HAD TO BE A FAVORABLE RETAIL CREDIT REPORT-BUT THAT WAS EASY . " Cartoonist Gray is evidently not as jealous of the good name of the great Retail Credit Co. , which reports on commercial solvency of individuals and institutions from coast-to-coast , as were Retail Credit officials who were tipped off to the slip when the Greensboro , N. C. News ran the Orphan Annie strip a week in advance of its scheduled appearance . <P> Annie 's syndicate wired all papers to cut out " RETAIL CREDIT REPORT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Sunday comics . Last week under a Beg Pardon headline , the News performed the rare journalistic trick of apologizing for a statement in the same issue of the paper : " At the request of the Retail Credit Company , the News and the Chicago Tribune-New York News syndicate wish to make it plain that they did not intend to refer to any company or to the quality of the credit investigations of any company .
