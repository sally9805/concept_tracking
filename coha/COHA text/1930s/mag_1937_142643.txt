A nattily-dressed railroad electrician named Roy O. Widener , 35 , was tried in Sacramento , Calif. fortnight ago for flourishing a gun at his landlady and robbing her of $60 . While Superior Judge Dal M. Lemmon was instructing the jury , Widener was seized with a coughing fit , left the room to recover , accompanied by two bailiffs . Back in his courtroom chair , Widener heard the finish of Judge Lemmon 's jury charge , later heard the jury find him guilty of first-degree robbery and burglary . <P> Last week Lawyer Brannely learned of the incident , moved for a new trial on the basis of an 1855 California ruling in the case of People v. Kohler that " the prisoner , in case of a felony , must be present during the whole of his trial . " Judge Lemmon ruled that this prisoner had been absent only momentarily and the law cited was not applicable . Then he sentenced Roy Widener to an indeterminate term of five years to life in San Quentin Prison .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
