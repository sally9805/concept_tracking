In the 1870s Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch showed that microscopic germs cause diseases like anthrax , rabies , tuberculosis . Sixty years later and with vastly improved microscopes , bacteriologists are unable to see any germ positively responsible for smallpox , measles , infantile paralysis , the common cold . That invisible , specific contagia cause these diseases and many an-other is certain . Medical scientists call those submicroscopic substances viruses . But they do not know their true nature , and hence can not scientifically prevent common colds or infantile paralysis ( see p. 36 ) . <P> Last winter Chemist Wendell Meredith Stanley of the Rockefeller Institute appeared at Atlantic City where the Association for the Advancement of Science was holding its annual meeting , and informed the whole scientific world 1 ) that a virus was a huge molecule composed basically of nitrogen , carbon , hydrogen and oxygen , weighing 17,000,000 times as-much as a hydrogen molecule , and measuring one seven-hundred-thousandth of an inch in diameter ; 2 ) that he had crystallized a typical virus ( which causes mosaic diseases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had modified the virus molecule chemically and produced other types of plant disease ; 4 ) that he had made the molecule inactive . All this proved , said Dr. Stanley , that " a virus is a protein molecule and as such may be regarded as non-living . " The A. A. A. S. gave him a $1,000 prize for his work ( TIME , Jan. 11 ) . <P> There remained , however , one grave doubt about Dr. Stanley 's work . Did his chemical treatment of viruses alter them ? The Rockefeller staff had the answer to that . But they waited until last week when the summer meeting of the A. A. A. S. at Denver ( see p. 40 ) again gave them a big , public stage . <P> Dr. Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff , a Rockefeller biophysicist , uses a squeeze-press , an ultracentrifuge ( TIME , Feb. 6 , 1933 ) , and an X-ray analyzer of crystalline substances . The press enables him to get juices from infected tissue without modifying ingredients in the slightest . The ultracentrifuge , whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers , including one of pure crystalline virus . X-rays prove that this virus , obtained by physical means , is exactly the same as the virus which Dr. Stanley obtained by chemical means . <P> Therefore , in all probability viruses are lifeless molecules . And , concluded Dr. Wyckoff , sweating on one of the hottest days Denver ever experienced , " a new field of research into the mechanism and control of disease is opened up by the possibility of treating its cause as a pure chemical compound . It is not unreasonable to hope that experiments of this type will some day indicate a new way in which the body can protect itself against dis-ease. "
