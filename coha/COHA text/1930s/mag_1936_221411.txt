Eager to get something on Messiah William Aberhart , radiorating Premier of Alberta who won control of that province with " Social Credit " promises of $25 per month to every citizen , is nearly every other politician in Canada . This week they at last had something on " Bible Bill . " <P> In a recent radioration the Premier enlivened his remarks by telling the story of the engaged young man who calls on his fiance in a maternity ward only to have her exclaim : " If this is what marriage means , John , our engagement is off ! " To the thousands of devoted followers of William Aberhart who are paying members of his Prophetic Bible Institute , there is nothing about this story which makes it unsuitable for the family circle . Deluged , however , was the Canadian Radio Commission with telephone calls , telegrams and written demands that Social Credit in the person of William Aberhart be curbed on the air .                   @ @
