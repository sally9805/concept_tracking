Into Albuquerque , N. M. , last week rolled a bus with an unusual group of children . None of them had ever eaten an ice-cream cone or seen a cinema , although they lived only 40 miles away in the little Spanish-American mountain village of Juan Tomas . Juan Tomas , on the eastern slope of the Manzanos , has seven houses , a church and a school . It has no store , no telephones , no radios , since none of Juan Tomas ' families owns a motor car , the only glimpse its children have of modern civilization is of the puffs of smoke rising from railroad trains in the Rio Grande Valley . <P> To the Albuquerque Tribune , which arranged it , the trip was a fine journalistic stunt . For the children , although they did not know it , it was an extraordinary dose of education . All Juan Tomas ' 40 schoolboys and girls ( aged 5 to 13 ) , except three who were ill , arrived sober and silent , drinking in everything with their eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch and ice cream . Five little girls found they did not like ice cream , gave their cones away . The rest nibbled tentatively , then gulped . <P> After lunch they looked at Albuquerque 's buildings , rode on Albuquerque policemen 's motorcycles , squealed as they rode up the elevator to the top of Albuquerque 's eight-story First National Bank Building . Although their hosts had not planned it , they were educated in pain as well as pleasure : as they watched Albuquerque 's firemen climb a building , a rope broke . Firemen Frank Parenti and George Tafoya fell 40 feet , were seriously injured . The children agreed to spend part of the money they had been saving for playground equipment to send flowers to the firemen . <P> At the cinema the youngsters perched on the backs of the folded seats until their teacher explained they could be let down . They saw Tom Sawyer , wept when Tom and Becky were lost in the cave , failed to laugh at any part of it . <P> Biggest thrill to the Juan Tomas children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders of nature . They insisted on seeing the zoo twice , were most awed by the monkeys and lions . Said a sparkling-eyed 5-year-old , looking at the ostrich : " Oh , what a big chicken ! "
