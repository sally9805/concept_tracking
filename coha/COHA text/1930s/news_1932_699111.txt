txt Abandoning his defensive attitude on political questions , President Hoover today mobilized the power and prestige of his high office for a determined attack on the proposal for immediate cash payment of the World War veterans ' bonus , contending such legislation " would be a deadly blow at the welfare of the nation . " Intended specifically to make the Administration position clear to the American Legion convention at Portland , the lengthy statement also constituted a challenge to the Democratic presidential candidate , who has not recently clarified his stand on the bonus and a direct attack on the Democratic vice-presidential candidate for permitting bonus legislation to be passed in the last House which would have constituted " an act of moral bankruptcy . " In addition , the statement pleaded for popular support against a movement which proposes to pay out $2,250,000,000 from a Treasury where " no such sum is available , " , and which " would chain every family budget in our country today and weigh heavily on business struggling in the midst of depression . " This was accompanied witti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost much in this depression , we still have much more to lose . " That the statement would succeed in stemming the tide at Portland for a declaration of Legion policy in support of the bonus was not seriously expected in White House circles , since it was understood the legislation committee approved the cash bonus by a vote of 21 to 9 just as President Hoover was drafting his , attack on it . It was firmly expected , however , that the straightforward position taken by the President would make a strong appeal to the people of the nation , already acutely conscious of the burden of taxation , and would react strongly to his advantage in the political campaign . Administration leaders are perfectly frank . to admit that the Republican Party has lost a large part of the veteran vote of the country from the President 's opposition to the bonus and from the forcible eviction of the bonus army from Washington . The President 's statement , they expect . will turn this situation to Republican advantage by embarrassing Governor Roosevelt and by demonstrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treasury raid fol. the benefit of a specific class . The Hoover statement constitutes a direct answer to the challenge enunciated by Mr. Smith in the last ' number of the Saturday Evening Post , in which he declared the American people had a right to know where their candidates stand on the bonus issue . If Governor Roosevelt fails to take a similar position , the Republicans expect to gain support from Smith Democrats in New England , whereas if he does it will certainly minimize the veteran antagonism against the Republicans by directing it equally at both candidates . Hoover 's Statement The full text of President Hoover 's Statement follows : It is due to the country and to the veterans that there should be no misunderstanding of my position upon payment of the face value . of the adjusted service certificates prior to maturity , as recommended in the resolution pending before the convention at Portland . I have consistently opposed it . In public interest I must continue to oppose it . I have the duty not alone to see that justice and a sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their families . but also to exert myself for justice to the other 21,000,000 ' families to whom consummation of this proposal at this time would be a calamity . Cash payment of face value of certificates today would require an ap- propriation from the treasury of about $2,300,000,000 . No matter how or in what form the payment to the veterans Is imposed it will come out of all these families , but of more importance it will indefinitely set back any hope of recovery for employment , agriculture or business and will impose indefinite distress upon the whole country . We owe Justice and generosity to the men who have served under our flag . Our people have tried to discharge that obligation . Regular expenditures on account of the veterans already constitute nearly a billion a year or almost one fourth of our whole federal budget . Every right-thinking man has the deepest sympathy for the veteran suffering from disability , for those out of work or for veterans on farms struggling with the adversities of the depression . No one who began life in the humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most impressionable age learned the meaning of poverty from actual experience , can be lacking in feeling mid understanding of the problems and sufferings of these men and their families . I have seen war at first hand . I know the courage , the sacrifice of our soldiers . Others Entitled But there are many million others in the same circumstances . They , too must be entitled to consideration . Their employment and their farm recovery , as well as that of the veterans , can be secured only by the restoration of the normal economic life of the nation . To that end we have been and are devcting our best efforts . Anything that stands in the way must be opposed . The welfare of the nation as a whole must take precedence over the demands of any particular group . I do not believe that the veterans generally really understand the adjusted service certificate law ( so-called bonus teal , which was proposed by thdmselves . In its simplest terms that law provides that an annual sum of about $112 , 000.000 is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is calculated to amount to a total of $3.500.000,000. the face %little of certificates to be distributed in 1945 . Approximately $1,300,000,000 has been paid into this fund . Under the law of last year authorizing loans up to 50 per cent of the face amount of the certificates , if we ta , : e into consideration loans made through the veterans life insurance fund which will have to be repaid , all this accumulated sum and more has already been ' distributed . If the Government distributed to the veterans ' the $112,000,000 annually from now . on it would represent the Government 's obligation . If these sums be kept in the fund the Government adds compound interest on each installment and gives a life insurance right . By paying the adjusted service certificates at their 1945 face value now the Government would not only be paying all remaining 13 annual installments in advance b t would be paying the compound interest upon them in advance . This would , I am advised , add about 52,250,000.000 to the amount which the people of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the certificates . Money Not Available No such sum is available . It can not be raised by adding to the crushing burden of taxes which drain every family budges in our country today and weigh heavily on business struggling in the midst of depression . It can not he borrowed without , impairment of the credit of the national Government and thus destroy that confidence upon which our whole system depends . It is unthinkable that the Government of the United States should resort to the printing press and the issuance of fiat currency as provided in the bill which passed the House at the last session of Congress under the leadership of the Democratic vice-presidential candidate . Such an act of moral bankruptcy would depreciate and might ultimately destroy the value of every dollar in the United States . It would cause the collapse of all confidence in our Government and would bring widespread ruin to the entire country and to every one of our citizens . Denied Webster 100 years ago stated : " He who tampers with the currency robs labor of its bread , he panders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and may shift for itself ; but he beggars labor which is hon- est , unsuspecting , and too busy with the present to calculate for the future . The prosperity of the working classes lives , moves and has its being in established credit , and a steady medium of payment . " And nib experience of every government in the world since that day has confirmed Webster 's statement . Let us not forget that while we have lost much in this depression , we still have much more to lose . And our whole future may be . said to depend upon early recovery . ' For many months the right-thinking men of both parties have been engaged in organizing and mobilizing the resources of the nation to promote the economic recovery which is the one sure and effective means of restoring the standard of living of all of our people and rescuing millions of them from suffering and misery . The proposal to levy over $2,000 , - 000,000 and to pay it to a particular group constitutes . a fatal threat to the entire program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for their well-being , security and happiness . In my judgment the enactment of any such proposal into legislation would be a deadly blow at the welfare of the nation . I was elected to protect and promote the interests of all of the people . As long as I am President I shall continue to do so and to oppose with all of the urength and influence at my command any demand that runs counter to the common welfare .
