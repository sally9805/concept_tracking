txt The promotion of home ownership through a reduction in cash requirements was suggested by President Hoover to*ight in an address which opened the President 's conference on home building and home ownership . Speaking in Constitution Hall be- , fore an audience of more than 2,000 delegates to the conference , and over the networks of the Columbia and National Broadcasting Systems , the President outlined the scope of the conference suggested by him more than a year ago . Mr. Hoover emphasized the financial factor involved in home ownership as more important than any other phase , although he gave regard to the problems of community planning and like activities . He pointed out that investors can obtain " abundant and mobile finance for 50 per cent of the cost of a home through a first mortgage . " " Our chief problem in finances re , lates to those who have an earnest desire for a home , who have a job and therefore possess sound character credit , but whose initial resources run to only 20 or 25 per cent , " he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their rent and all their savings to gain for themselves this independence and security and social wellbeing . Such people are a good risk . They are the very basis of stability to the nation . " No Songs About Rent Receipts . " " To find a way to meet their need is one of the problems that you have to consider . That is , how we can make a home available for instalment purchase on terms that dignify the name credit and not upon terms and risks comparable to the credit extended by a pawnbroker . " The President said he was confident that home ownership is a dream shared by " almost every individual in our country , " and said that this conference was based on the " aspiration that each family may pass their days in the home which they own . " " There can be no fear for a democracy or self-government or for liberty or freedom from home owners no matter how humble they may be , " the President said , adding , a minute later : " We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they never sing songs about a pile of rent receipts . " The President also noted what he termed a general belief that the development of urban life has " driven us to less and less possible ownership of homes . " " I do not agree with that , " he said . " The very development of transportation , the advantages of distribution of industry today make the ownership of homes far more feasible and desirable than ever before . Plan Not Merely Emergency Measure " But it involves vast problems of city and industrial management which we should have the courage to face . " It also involves a great problem of finance . The newly-married pair setting out pon the stream of life seldom come to their new state with sufficient resources to purchase or enter upon that great adventure of life of building a home . " President Hoover compared his recommendation that means be provided for the ownership of homes through lower down-payments with instalment-buying terms granted in the automobile and other industries . The President said also that his recent suggestions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to cope with emergencies incidental to the industrial depression but also , " In ith longdistance view , it was put forward in the confidence that , through the creation of an institution of this character , we could gradually work out the problem of systematically promoted home ownership on such terms of sound finance as people who have the home-ownership inspiration deserve in this country .

Government Survey of 37 Cities Is Given to the Home Conference . Speciui to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , Dec. 2 . ? Vacancies in residential buildings were found to be " unexpectedly low " in thirtyseven leading cities by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made public tonight in connection with the opening of the President 's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership . " Less than 5 per cent of the singlefamily houses are vacant in twothirds of the cities and in no city do the figures exceed 9.5 per cent , " the report said . Vacancies in apartments ranged from 6.8 per cent to 27.2 per . cent ; in flats from 4.4 per cent to 20.2 ; and in two-family houses from 3.4 per cent to 20.1 . " The tendency to ' double up ' due to curtailment of income , " the report continued , " should be carefully considered in any analysis of vacancy figures at the present time . In St. Louis , for instance , where data on extra families are available , there are more than two and one-half times as many extra families living in single houses as there are single houses vacant . The number of extra families is equal to about 5 per cent of the total number of dwelling units in the city . " This percentage is greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the cities where ' doubling up ' is now greater than the vacancies housing shortage may accompany any substantial increase in business activity , since those families that are now living with friends and relatives will undoubtedly move into separate quarters just as soon as their incomes permit them to do so . " The survey was made public a few hours after Alvin B. Wolosoff of Forest Hills , L. I. , a builder , had declared to the delegates at a luncheon at the Mayflower Hotel that 1931 was the best business yG:Lr for Long Island builders since 1925 . They erected and sold 8,600 homes in 1931 up to Dec. 1 , compared with 70,000 small homes constructed in the same period in all parts of the United States . " We have not had a greater natural home market than the rest of the country , " Mr. Wolosoff asserted , " but instead of waiting for a natural market- to come along we created our own market . " Taking advantage of low prices . large-scale production and modern building methods , and using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for comfort and convenience , as well as the newest ideas in design and decoration , we were able to turn out a product which inspired a desire to own in people who never even had intention of buying . " On top of this we arranged easy terms , instituted larger advertising campaigns , secured the cooperation of newspapers and improved our selling methods . Thus did we change what might have been depression for us , too , to decided success . " It is no exaggeration to say that in many of the developments on Long Island as many as 15,000 went through model homes in a single day . " OPPOSE HOOVER MOVE .
