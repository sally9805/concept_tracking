Royal Visit ( cont 'd ) <P> Sirs : <P> I disagree with the gentlemen in Montreal TIME , June 5 regarding your reporting of the Royal tour . I think you are doing a fine job , in fact an excellent job all round . . . . WM . R. HADDOCK Toronto , Ont . <P> Sirs : <P> Lest your spirit be bruised by articulate flat-footed imperialists , let me say that TIME 'S objective coverage of the Royal Visit was TIMEly . The Canadian press , usually independent , fell flat on its face in the wave of hysteria which trailed the visit from coast to coast . " She smiled " and the press took over the role of angels . . . . <P> As district correspondent for seven years from Toronto to Vancouver , I sent off an account of their stop at Field near the crest of the Rockies . They had motored from Banff to Lake Louise , to Field , where their train awaited them , over one of the most spectacular drives in the world . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been to them to stare at this magnificent , regal mountain splendor , unwatched , after consistently playing the other role . It concluded with the remark that Mount Donald which towers over Field was cloud-capped during the visit and did not uncover for " God Save the King . " <P> My story was ignored , even by the local weekly for which I work , and which is distinctly " folksy . " <P> Maybe it 's just sour grapes , but go ahead , I like it . <P> NANCY PERLEY MILES Cranbrook , B. C. <P> Sirs : <P> TIME , June 5 , publishes - two letters from Montreal criticizing your reporting , in the issues of May 15 and 29 , of the Royal Visit to Canada . <P> Mr. W. B. Harper evidently does not like having his Sovereigns " de-bunked . " Had he read TIME as long as the writer , he would have known , 1 ) that TIME does not always go abroad to be " raw , " " fresh " and " Smart Aleck , " 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated to get under people 's skins . <P> The article seems to the writer well calculated to inform your readers as to the present status of the British Crown , particularly as a constitutional device to unify the Empire . <P> I wish distinctly to take issue with Mr. Harper on the value of TIME to a Canadian reader : while its cover of Canadian news is grossly inadequate , and often trivial , TIME does beat the newspapers ; examples : 1 ) the rise of Anthony Eden in British politics , ( TIME was at least six months ahead of the newspapers ) , 2 ) I'Affaire Simpson . . . . <P> <P> You should know that Mayor Houde , who seems in the past year to have become TIME-worthy , " wowed " Their Majesties . Antic : opening conversation at the banquet here by studying , as he sat between them , a list of conventions prepared for him which included the one that he must not open the conversation . . . . <P> GORDON D. McKAY <P> Montreal , Canada <P> Cope v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
