txt Before a wildly cheering audience of 10,000 persons in the Fair Grounds here tonight , Thomas E. Dewey taunted Governor Herbert H. Lehman with failure to answer his speech in Suffolk County last week on the budgetary practices of the State , except by charging " vilification . " The Governor , he said ) has not answered or denied a " single statement of fact contained in that speech , " and the charges that the Governor has created a " balanced fittdget " that is essentially . a paper balance achieved by moving tax due dates and expenditure . dates to bring them within a fiscal year were repeated by Mr. Dewey . He declared that the Governor , in making an answer to his budget I speech had committed four errors and compiled a score of " no runs , no hits , four errors . " Mr. Dewey pleaded guilty to an error on his own account . In his speech attacking the O'Connell machine of Albany , he had charged that Daniel O'Connell , one of the three O'Connell brothers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a room and urged Governor Lehman , at the Democratic convention in Rochester , to run again . " Well , " Mr. Dewey said , " I was wrong about that . We have it on the word of the chairman of the Democratic National Committee that Dan O'Connell did not sit on a bed . He sat in a chair  --  a nice , big . easy chair . " Mr. Dewey went beyond a prepared speech to repeat parts of addresses he had delivered earlier in Suffolk County last week and in Albany and Troy last night . The grandstand at ' the Mineola Fair Grounds was filled and an overflow crowd covered the field and track as far as the loudspeakers would reach . Mr. Dewey 's , speech was broadcast over the State . Although , when . he finished , many of the local candidates remained to speak , the crowd began to filter away . The meeting had been preceded by a parade through the fair grounds and around the track . Among those introduced from the platform prior to Mr. Dewey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt , a prior candidate for the office that Mr. Dewey is seeking . The appearance here , which followed an afternoon on Long Island as the guest of Russell Sprague , the Republican county chairman , preceded another up-State trip to Elmira , Owego and Binghamton tomorrow . " I had hoped , " Mr. Dewey said , " that my opponent might have some word to say about the shocking abuse of political power in Albany County . I had hoped he would say something about the twice-convicted boss of Albany . " Instead he chose to speak about a subject I had discussed the previous Saturday at Timber Point in Suffolk County ? the balancing of the budget . The Governor lapsed into generalities . He accused me of vilification , disrespect and false innuendo in my budget speech . He spoke of the sinister misrepresentation about the budget . " Now the Governor has accused me of misstating the facts concerning the finances of the State . That is a most serious charge . I agree with my opponent that no man who deliberately misrepresents the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am accused of vilification , disrespect and innuendo . Since the Governor of the State made these charges I actually wondered if  --  I had made a mistake . So I went back and reread my speech . Now let 's see what it says . " I found that what I said was the truth and I found that the- Governor had not contradicted a single statement in my speech . " My position then was and it now is this : The Governor had made political capital of his balanced budget He has omitted to say in this campaign how the budget was balanced . " In five years an accumulated deficit of $97,000,000 was turned into a cash balance of $6,500,000 . But of that $97,000,000 deficit , $85 , - 000,000 was wiped out by bookkeeping devices , by moving ahead the date when certain taxes fell due and by postponing the payment of certain State obligations . In short , by niceties of bookkeeping . " Taking the Governor 's answer to the budget speech detail by detail , Mr. Dewey charged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suffolk speech . Swinging back into the O'Connell material he repeated the " Can the Governor say as much ? " series of questions he had used in Albany and Troy on the previous . evening . Every time that Mr. Dewey put his question , a thundering " No " came back from the crowd. ,
