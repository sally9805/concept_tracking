" Mr. William Randolph Hearst , " reported Mr. Hearst 's New York American last fortnight , " . . . has committed the unforgivable offense , in the eyes of the ' PoleCat Committee , ' of invoking the court 's protection against a marauding and lawless group of ignorant Senators . " <P> Translated into the language of factual reporting , this meant that Publisher Hearst was suing in District of Columbia Supreme Court to enjoin the Senate lobby investigating committee from making any use of Hearst telegrams which it had seized ( TIME . March 23 ) . <P> In Washington last week Chief Justice Alfred Adams Wheat , who last month granted an injunction forbidding Western Union to supply the Senate investigating committee with telegrams of the Chicago law firm of Winston , Strawn &; Shaw , reluctantly dismissed the Hearst suit . " I will have to hold . " ruled he . " that the court has no jurisdiction over that Senate committee . . . . If the Senate committee has been proceeding in a way which some people might regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it and let that be corrected in some other way than it is for me to proceed in the way that seems to me to be unlawful to attempt to correct what they do that I do not agree with .
