I FEAR that I suffer from many disqualifications for expressing any judgment on the subject of morals . For one thing , I am sixty and , therefore , in the opinion of some critics disallowed from the outset . I am a paterfamilias and , therefore , accustomed to a hypocritical use of authority . Then again I am an unmitigated highbrow , and do not understand the feelings of ordinary healthy men . On this last point I do rather feel with my supposed critics . I agree that the traditional thinking and theorizing about morals , as about most other things , has been done too much by the people who happen to like thinking and theorizing , people of mild passions and sheltered lives , who scarcely understand the lusts and angers of ordinary humanity or the tough squeezes of the struggle for life . Yet there is no help for it . Thinking must be done by the people who do not mind thinking , however badly we do it . And the lowbrow may comfort himself with the knowledge that , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always govern us . I wish to write , then , on the crisis in morals . But is there any crisis at all , or is the whole suggestion a silly newspaper scare ? I think there is , and I will give one or two reasons for the belief . The Japanese Government has recently published an Annual of Japanese Art for the year 1927 , a beautiful book . In it there are two main schools represented , one which follows the native tradition and one which has fallen under the influence of Europe . I wish I could show my readers the pictures in question , for without them I can not convince anyone who differs from me . But , as a student of history and civilization , I feel confident that if the two styles of art given in that book had been found by excavation on some ancient site , every critic would have said , " At this point it is clear that the old and fine civilization of Japan was overrun and almost destroyed by a peculiarly low type of barbarian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minoan Empire , or in the collapse of Roman Africa under the attacks of the negroes . " Again , I notice in advanced Liberal journals , both in England and America , not merely a desire for legal reform in certain sexual matters where reform is probably overdue , but a sort of disinterested enthusiasm for sexual misconduct in all its forms , from obscene language to unnatural vice . A word of condemnation for such things produces a storm of protest . This tone recurs pretty often in history , but is unusually marked at the present day . Lastly , I can appeal to the authority of so able au observer as Mr. Lippmann in his A Preface to Mora ? . He is convinced that among the young of the richer classes in America , at least , there is an exceptional state of moral anarchy . The point is well put by a friend of mine , writing about Lippmann 's book : " I have much sympathy with this young generation . It has seen so many myths exploded around it : not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altruism , public spirit , that it believes in no myths at all . And you need to be very tough indeed to be able to do without any myths . " The writer uses the word myth in a peculiar sense , meaning , I fancy , what St. Paul meant by Faith , a belief not exactly proved nor provable , but held because of some general bias of character . This is well put . You will generally find the same thing put crudely by people who have not the habit of considering the meaning of the words they use . There are people who say they are unmoral " ? which would mean that they saw no moral difference between , say , murdering their mother for a dollar and earning the dollar by an hour 's teaching ; or that they believe in " no general principles whatever " ? e.g. that two by two equals four or that fire burns ; or they mean to take nothing for granted but to try everything by experiment ? e.g. to see if arsenic really poisons them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can find published in abundance , are of course utterly clumsy and inaccurate , The truth is , they express desire ratherthan thought . But that is natural ; one of the surest symptons of anarchy is the substitution of desire for thought . Now the first great point to remember is that the Rebellion of the Young against the Old is normal , both biologically and sociologically . Biologically , there is a period during which the mother feeds the child , a period when the parents support and protect it and , therefore , control its actions , and a period in which it breaks loose from control and insists on standing upon its own feet . Birds , who take their parental duties very seriously , slave to feed and defend their young for a few months , and then at the suitable moment turn them out of the nest and peck them if they try to get in again . Birds know their business . Biologically , the rebellion is right . It is also right sociologically . Modern psychologists have pointed out that man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions of his society , is one of what they call " ambivalence . " That is to say , he has at the same moment , or at two successive moments , contradictory emotions towards it . As a representative of the society which imposes the convention , he feels indignation at the breach of it ; as one of the individuals on whom it is enforced , he feels a certain hostility towards it and a wish to elude it . And in general one emotion or the other preponderates in a man according as he has most to gain or to lose . In the sphere of property the young man likes to take his father 's handkerchiefs , collars , studs , golf clubs , tennis racket , and anything else that may suit him ; only a very spirited father retaliates by stealing his son 's things , and then to no purpose , for he has to pay for them . In the sphere of sex the young unmarried woman likes to pursue her natural prey unhindered and uncriticized ; the married woman has secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she is content to ask for no more if only other women will not try to rob her . moved , and those people ? whether few or many ? who were deterred from promiscuity only by fear of social punishment are now almost free from that fear . All these influences have had a dissolvent effect . All of them in the first impression on an untrained and unphilosophic mind are destructive of morality ; and we must always remember that most minds are utterly untrained and unphilosophic . Lastly , there has been the false theory : a theory which has already done a vast amount of harm in education and is still running riot in the sphere of art . I mean the worship of self-expression . I will leave art aside for the present , but in education I believe this vicious dogma is approaching its unlamented burial . ' No doubt it had some psychological excuse for coming into existence as a protest against an excessive authoritarianism which tried to turn out all pupils according to one pattern . It was right to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate ways . But to suggest that the pupil 's whole duty is to express himself , and the teacher 's whole duty to help him to do so , seems to me to be the direct contrary of true education . What I as a student have wanted to receive ? and what as a teacher I have tried to give ? has been always in different contexts the same thing : I wanted to get into contact with minds superior to my own , and thereby to become capable of seeing things which I could not now see , and appreciating and enjoying things that were now above me . We all start life with an extremely limited appreciation of the greatness and beauty by which we are surrounded , and also with a pretty confident opinion that a thing which does not happen to please us is not up to much . I can not imagine an education which for me personally would have been more utterly damnable than to teach me to be contented with my existing beliefs and powers and just express them ? to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of the universe , and simply encourage him to go ahead . I trust however that this nightmare will pass . I have suggested , then , that the Crisis in Morals is due largely , though of course not exclusively , to a certain number of causes . I will now say a word about the real conclusions which I think should be drawn from these causes . Of the false theory I will not speak . The way to deal with a false theory is not to believe it . Of the War I will not speak either . We must recover from it and learn , now that we have leisure , its true lessons . As to the emancipation of women , I think that so great a revolution has naturally produced some confusion of thought and conduct . As this confusion clears away , I think we shall find our current rules of sexual conduct , which were framed to suit one set of conditions , partly rewritten to suit another . They will be written , as they usually are , by women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to suppose that they will be lower or more lax in their demands on human nature . But what are we to say about the advances in psychology , especially the theories of Freud , so much and so incompetently disseminated ? I think there is no doubt that the first effect of the spread of these theories has been had . It is rather like the first effect on medical students of the dissecting room and the operating theater . Some are horrified , some are brutalized , many are nervously upset . The action is twofold : first there is the shock of disgust at being thrown into familiar contact with things which ordinary social instinct , from primitive times down to the present , treats with extreme reserve . Second , there is the abrupt discovery that much , and perhaps all of our emotional and spiritual nature has a physical and often a grossly physical basis . What should our attitude be to this new danger ? Well , apart from exaggerations and follies on which I need not dwell . I think there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time that our higher nature has a physical basis , and a very large number of our noblest emotions actually have a sexual basis ? The fact remains that they are by now miles away from that basis , and there is no reason for dragging them back to it . If Shakespeare was descended from some sort of anthropoid ape , that does not mean that " Hamlet " is only a mass of rnonkeyish gibberings . The important fact is the fact of development : the rise , intellectual and spiritual , of the thing that was an ape into the thing that is Shakespeare . The new psychologists talk much of the Internal Censor and delight to show us the unpleasant objects which he has attempted to hide . But the most interesting thing that they have proved is the actual existence of this Censor and all that his existence implies . The suppressions and disguises of which they speak so much are only his failures : they form the fringe of a much greater and more effective activity , rejecting , conquering , sublimating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Censor within us does wish to reject certain things ? however ineffectively he may sometimes do it ? is of great psychological importance . It proves that there is , deeply implanted from time immemorial in man 's nature , this instinctive determination not to be content with oneself as one is , but somehow to be cleaner and higher ; to suppress and reduce to nothingness the sort of things that drag one down , and to concentrate attention and effort on the higher parts of one 's being . It does not invalidate this consideration to be told that in cases of mental disease the Censor 's work has to be undone . That is only to be expected in cases of disease . The point is that man , who has risen from the ape , has apparently done so by the help and guidance of this inward spirit which rejects filth and denies it . It is not Victorian prudery , it is not Christian asceticism , it is not even the Hellenic tradition , which dislikes uncleanness , physical and moral ; it is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control I will say only a word or two . I have no sympathy with that form of social timidity which would keep from those who need it most , under due medical advice , information which is easily accessible to all the upper and middle classes and a mere commonplace among those who practice vice . But our question here is not whether the general knowledge of contraceptive methods is desirable , but , granted that it exists as a fact , what effect it ought to have on our moral beliefs and actions . The suggestion often made , and emphasized for instance by Mr. Lippmann , is this : since intercourse can now take place without any serious danger of pregnancy ensuing , not only is it much easier to escape detection , but the action itself is of much less social importance . It is sometimes added , on the same line of thought , that if the danger of venereal disease were also eliminated the action would become entirely unobjectionable from the ethical standpoint ? as harmless as lawn tennis or dancing . Now is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I have , on occasion , felt instinctive disgust or disapproval at hearing of some lewd behavior , was that feeling in the least degree dependent on the probability that the actions in question would lead either to venereal disease or to the birth of illegitimate children ? I think , not in the least . I think the dislike was predominantly a feeling of fastidiousness , an a sthetic repulsion . Second , I ask myself whether the removal of these dangers would have had any effect on my conduct , or whether the fear of them was ever consciously a working motive leading me towards one course of action or another . Again my answer would be , as far as I can judge , not in the least . If that is so ? and of course it is a matter on which we are all liable to selfdeception ? I think it will probably turn out that the moral or aesthetic sense of mankind , or at any rate of the progressive part of mankind , utterly rebels against the treatment of sexual intercourse as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a principle which does not necessarily lead to monogamy , but does at least destroy desultory lewdness . And here we strike , I think , on a very important observation . Social conventions change : the particular actions calculated to suit them change with them , as , e.g. , if the rule of the road were changed in England we should drive on the right instead of the left . But the quality required for the right action does not change . It is just as important to drive carefully and considerately whatever the law of the road may be . The driver who says , " First they say ' left , ' then they say right . ' It is all a mess and I am free to be a road-hog " is indulging in a faLse argument . So monogamy and polygamy are social conventions ; but whichever you live under you can behave well or ill , you can be chaste or unchaste . This is not " mere Christian dogma . " It is a matter on which all the progressive races for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed very closely . For it is a great mistake to suppose that people did not observe character before they bad invented the proper scientific terms to describe it . Many an old nurse is a far shrewder judge of the psychology of a child than many a professional psychologist , though she could never put her knowledge in scientific or even in clear and consistent language . The psychological terms of ordinary speech , though scientifically elusive and often inconsistent , are as a matter of fact based on deep instincts and on sensitive observation . Social conventions may change ; I think , as regards the marriage laws they will change and ought to change . But I have little doubt that the value ofchastity and the need for chastity will remain , like the need for self-control , for fair dealing , for courage , for honesty , and for a number of other simple matters which can be felt better than defined . III And what is to be our attitude towards the Crisis itself ? Many people , of course , will fly to supernatural sanctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already collapsed beneath it . No doubt make-believe will do a great deal , but it is a treacherous foundation on which to build one 's life ; and I feel in this tendency a kind of infidelity to the very cause which we are trying to serve , using insincerity to persuade people to be sincere . But my chief objection is a practical one . I believe that the accepted morality , though always open to criticism , is in the main solidly based on the experience of the human race . There are hardly any social facts so well ascertained as the main moral principles of society ; and I think it absurd to base these well-ascertained principles on dubious dogmas or revelations about matters which are beyond the limits of normal human knowledge . Let me make my point clear . I am not denying the dogmas ; it may be true that Lazarus rose from the dead or that a certain experience of Professor Eddington is really a contact with God ; but neither of these propositions is anything like as sure and well attested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty or sobriety . But I need hardly labor the point further . Fallible man is always trying to provide himself with weapons which shall be infallible . The weapons which we really possess are of course imperfect . That is one of the essential conditions of the conflict that we call human life . Still , in the first place , we can put a good deal of trust in the normal reaction of society to anti-social vagaries . The corrupt young person gets him- or herself disliked . Even if inside a particular set it is considered admirable to be , let us say , drunken , lewd , and dishonest , the members of that set will in course of time find that people outside the set are numerous and powerful ; that it is awkward to go on doing things which they despise ; and that perhaps after all they are right . How far , again , can we trust to experience itself , since I say that our moral principles are based upon experience ? Of course , not completely . The experience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in each . It can swamp the exceptions in the general rule , and it can wait to the end of a process to see the result . The individual can not . Still he can observe and he can imagine . Experience is a very subtle drug , and a small dose of it can often make us understand and digest whole masses of observation and of precept . We learn to live by a mixture of the three , as we learn to walk or talk or play baseball . And in the process of learning or failing to learn , how can we help those who in any way look to us ? Here I have little to add to that which most sensible citizens know already . There are some mistakes to avoid . We should avoid being frightened . We should avoid hypocrisy . We should avoid the pursuit of edification at the expense of truth . We should avoid identifying the moral law with our personal interests or preferences . We should avoid preaching and finding fault , or trying to satisfy our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection . All these are truisms . I believe that to people of my generation and that which has succeeded it it is more important to lay stress on the need for discipline . My generation neglected it . We were eager to be sympathetic and enlightened . Perhaps we were timid . We liked to regard all naughtiness as a form of illness . We made the cruel mistake of keeping the child or young person protected against the natural consequences of his actions ; we prevented his learning the indispensable lessons of personal experience . We made on him the monstrous demand that he should supply all the necessary discipline of life from within by his own unaided virtue . I think , as a generation , we have reaped our natural reward . Punishment is a blessed thing . I pity the young who have grown up without it . I pity the old , the masters and mistresses of households , whom nobody dares to contradict , who are never , never put into the corner or whipped as they deserve . I pity the kings and emperors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them or made them behave themselves . But punishment is of no positive value ; only negative . For any positive help towards living a nobler life , apart from the influence of friendship and of education , I can only fall back on that real and widespread possession of the human race of which we have already spoken : that instinct which shows itself in the existence of the Internal Censor . It is an instinct both moral and aesthetic , which rejects things both because they are bad and because they are ugly , and pursues things both because they are good and because they are beautiful . Philosophers insist on drawing a distinction between these two , but I confess that I never can feel it very real . As far as I can analyze my own feelings , I should say that the motive which keeps me from a bad action is a feeling that as I contemplate it I do not like the look of it or the smell of it , I feel it to be ugly or foul or not decent ? not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , similarly , the thing that nerves me towards a good but difficult action is a feeling that it seems beautiful or fine , the sort of thing that I love as I look at it and would like to have for my own . Though not infallible , this moral or aesthetic instinct is a true fact . I believe it to be generally very strong in young people , at any rate in those who have real life in them , and , though often misdirected while they make their usual experiments , it has a way of correcting its own errors and ultimately finding its right course .. It , and perhaps it alone , answers the most troublesome of all questions which the cynic can put to the moralist : " Granted that it is useful to society that I should be honest , why should I mind about society if I can find my own profit in stealing ? " I refuse then to be frightened , though sometimes no doubt I feel concerned . We are passing through a time of strain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with good success . I trust for the general main-tenance and gradual raising of the moral standard in a society such as ours : first to the influence of the facts of life and the lessons taught by experience ; next to the social instincts and the reaction of a well-organized society upon its members by example , education , and training , by liking and disliking , admiration and disapproval ; and most of all to this inward Censor of whom the psychologists tell us , this inborn moral or aesthetic instinct , the ineradicable heritage of humanity , by which men have from the very beginnings of civilization rejected and denied what they feel to be vile within them , sought what they love , and imitated what they admire .
