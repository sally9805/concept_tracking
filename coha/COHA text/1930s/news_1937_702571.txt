Denhardt , the com ? monwealth had just begun its proof that Mrs. Verna Garr Taylor , the general 's fianc  --  e , was shot and killed at . a distance of several feet rather than with a revolver held in her own hands as the defendant has explained the tragedy of Nov. 6 , last . The trial was halted a few minutes before adjournment by a black hail storm that beat a machine gun tattoo against the tall windows and made all other sounds inaudible . Earlier in the gusty spring day , the robins had been singing through the open windows , where the crowd was held by stories from the witness stand , the sight of the big army revolver with which Mrs. Taylor was killed and the clothes that were taken from her body after she was found dead at Use end of a day 's automobile ride to Louisville with Gen , Denhardt .

In an early report on thin case , he had said that he had ob . served carbon , which would indicate the gun was held close to the body . Today he said he was mistaken ; that he had learned more about the effects of the embalming fluid that had been used . He had sent samples of the skin for microscopical examination in Louisville , he said , and the report will be a feature at the resumption of the trial Monday . Tile rest of the commonwealth 's case , which is expected to rest Wed . nesday , will be devoted to expert testimony on blood reactions and tests1 for powder and reactions on the hands of Mrs. Taylor and those of the general .

The case at the end of its fifth day ) f trial gives no clear picture of what sappened the night of Nov. 6 . The most convincing evidence that le state has put forward is , that Mrs. Taylor on the morning and after . noon before her death , gave no evidence that she was contemplating suicide . There was testimony today that Denhardt owns a fountain pen pistol , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of the shoot . ing and fired it to distract attention from himself .

Denhardt , told the jury in Judge Charles C. Marshall 's court that on a visit to the Denhardt farm last summer the general spoke of this pistol as among his collection of firearms . The elder Powell attempted to describe how it could be pulled out of a vest pocket in an emergency . His testimony was or . dered stricken from the record , but the statement of Roy that " 1 hoard Denhardt say he had a fountain pen pistol " was not challenged . Mystery Left to Jurors .

The testimony of George R. Baker , the farmer in front of whose home the shooting occurred , was to the ef ? feet that he heard a loud shot and several minutes later a pop like a pistol . In an earlier examination he had stated that " Denhardt could not have killed the woman because I was with him when the second shot was fired . " In his examination , he said he came out of the house and saw Denhardt moving about near his parked car at about the time he heard the second shot . The shot from the little pistol came just before he saw Denhardt , he said . .
