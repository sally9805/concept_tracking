Police smashed their way last week into a deserted villa on Constanta Beach , smart Black Sea bathing resort . In the cellar they disentangled a gruesome pile , 40 male skeletons , one female . <P> Cynical , experienced in Balkan wiles , the Rumanian police reconstructed the 41 murders thus : the woman lured the 40 men one by one to the villa of her man who slew each , robbed the corpse . Finally he slew her on the old Rumanian theory that " Dead women tell no tales . "
