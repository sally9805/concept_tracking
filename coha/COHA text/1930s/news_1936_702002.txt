txt The worst consequences of drought , far more serious than financial losses involved , are now apparent throughout the sheep and cattle country . The morale of men who have ridden the range most of their lives is at the breaking point , and many already have reached " the end of the trail . " What is happening in this typical cattle towns is true in many ' others east of the mountains . Urban populations are beginning to swell and by Winter will be twice their normal size , from the influx of those coming in from the country for certification to work on roads or conservation projects . Hundreds of " dry-land farmers , " those who tried to raise a crop on land that should never have been put to the plow , have left the Nuntry for other States , principally to the West . Abandoned farm buildings , their roofs beginning to sag , and without paint for years , appear occasionally as stark reminders that the range country can not be farmed intensively without expensive irrigation . The State relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggravating the situation . Many farmers and some cattle men who , if they could get such employment , would be able to carry their stock through the Winter , are being denied it . The result has been to place a penalty on thrift and further demoralize those who would do anything to hold over their stock for a fresh start next year . But the State relief authorities have ruled that individual re- sources must be first exhausted before employment on Federal projects can be obtained . In substance , this means that the applicant farmer must mortgage to the hilt his herds of sheep or cattle , and many are selling out completely rather than borrow and chance losing everything later . While this policy is recognized as being probably sound from the relief standpoint , the applicants contend that it is fostering a thing that Federal and State Government alike have been striving to prevent  --  the depopulation of the range . Both seem to have taken the position that this country must go back to grass for grazing and the sooner the better . The effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitiful results . Sitting in the loan office of one of the farm banks of the area one can see at first hand how it is working out . A young man of 33 came in with his wife of 29 in quest of a loan after a job had been refused him on one of the WPA projects . Both were neatly dressed , judged from local standards . Tears came to the eyes of the young man as he told of his father 's oft-repeated counsel that he should never borrow against the farm or stock . But he owed nearly $400 for groceries , clothes , machinery repairs and for medical service , the latter to the extent of $100 for an appendicitis operation last Fall . As part farmer and part stockman , the young man operated a 320-acre farm , with seventy-eight cattle and four horses , all of which was entirely clear of debt . He had fortyfive tons of hay and eight tons of roughage , or nearly enough to carry his stock through the Winter . One Mortgage Not Enough With a WPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family and carry the $400 of debts as well . With a mortgage on his chattel , the State regulations would make him eligible for the WPA job . But if the banker to whom he went is any judge of what is likely to happen , the young man will not be so fortunate . He will be told that a $400 mortgage on $2,300 worth of livestock is a long way from exhausting his own resources , and will be advised to borrow more . There will be the further necessity of borrowing to pay taxes ; the successful farmer is scrupulous about such matters . And if the young man borrows the maximum amount on his stock , it will be years before he can again call them his own . The banker said that it was the best loan he had made in a month , but that a WPA job would have made it unnecessary and would have left the young man in a far better state , spiritually and materially . Multiply this case by several hundred and one gets an inkling of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . Resentment runs high in the East ' ern Montana cattle towns among practical business men ? who have for years been dealing with the small but successful farmer-stockman  --  over the administration of the work relief program to date . The complaint , summed up , is that Federal aid is being given to those least worthy of it . Resentment Is Intensified Those who have been able to make a go either of dry-land farming or cattle-raising , and who have squandered their money when they had it , have been the principal beneficiaries , say the town elders . Now that ruined crops and scorched ranges have added to the number of needy and created a new class of hard-ups who can not get relief , the resentment has become the more intense . Meanwhile , the cattle move out by the hundreds of carloads , while in stifling lobbies of small hotels bronzed men in boots and ten-gallon hats sit around talking of " the old days " when cattle were run from Texas to the Dakotas and Montana and marketed at good prices with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Guess it 's the end of the trail for a lot of us , " says one of the old timers . " There ai n't enough feed to take ' em through the Whiter , and even if there was all the hay in the world to be bought , cattle ca n't pay out with hay at $12 and $14 a ton . " Although nearly every one tells the same story , many cattle men consider their lot philosophically . Nothing New to Be " Busted " " This ai n't nothin ' new for most of us , " said another weatherbeaten rancher . " I been busted six times before and I 'm that way right now . But you ca n't come back so easy any more . " Restricted grazing and dry-land farming make a big difference . " In somewhat better position than the cattle men are the sheep ranchers . Because sheep can graze much closer than the cattle , the sheep , with water , can still get some nourishment even from the burned prairies . They will still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved out , either to greener pastures or to market . But the sheep ranchers Over wide areas have found considerable cause for concern . New wells have to be dug every two or three days now in some sections , so quickly do the sheep deplete the little remaining dried-up grass . It is true , however , of cattle and sheep men alike that those who can possibly do so are holding out as long as they can . Few hope to weather the winter months with present feed supplies . A considerable number of cattle raisers have enough feed on hand to carry the stock through , but , in the absence of pastures , this is being used at present . The determining factor will be whether the country hereabout gets good rains by mid-August . Last year there was a downpour about that time and in four days the prairies were green again . The cattle grazed into the Fall months and enough was cut for hay to carry already depleted herds through the Winter and to form a feed basis that is still on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mid-August will not be enough to do the trick , however , for the grasshoppers , Norman crickets and ever larger black beetles will still be around unless they have starved to death by that time . But if good rains are had , the moisture may be sufficient to slow up the " hoppers " and their devastating companions . A new problem , but one of ancient origin , has been added to the already distressed condition of the Eastern Montana cattle men . There has been an outbreak of rustling in several heavy producing sections and nearly a hundred head have been reported stolen to date , without any one being apprehended . The chief cause of the thefts , in the opinion of the local police , has been the influx of trucks into the southern sections of Montana for use in hauling cattle to Nebraska and other sections having some s pastures . Fearing similar incidents , the authorities have strengthened the highway patrol , but it is conceded that this will do little good with ! out greater cooperation from con ' tiguous States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
