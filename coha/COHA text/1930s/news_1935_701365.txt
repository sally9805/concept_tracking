txt In the presence of a great throng , Governor Lehman formally opened the new State-owned Saratoga Spa today . Standing in front of the steps leading to the new Hall of Springs , the Governor looked out across a green esplanade over a small lake reflecting the green arches of a mighty elm . " The completion of this great institution is a notable event in the history of our State , " he said . " It is notable from the standpoint of social service , for it adds to an already incomparable public health service another unique agency . " It is notable'from the standpoint of conservation , for this Spa is evidence of recognition by a State that there are other natural resources vital to the public interest than the timber , water power and minerals which we commonly associate with that term . " Thousands listening to the Governor sat on the green grass , newly grown , on the sloping edges of the lawns about the lake . They clustered under the long arcade of the new Simon Baruch Research Laboratory stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its brick portico . Amplifiers carried the Governor 's words a hundred yards to these and still further to others walking about the spacious grounds on which the new Spa with its seven buildings has been built . He reviewed briefly something of the history of the project , told how the State started a quarter of a century ago to acquire the 163 famous springs , which were being exhausted by private exploitation , and the lands surrounding them . He recalled the purchase of the 1,200 acres in the development and the erection of the most complete hydro-therapeutic plant in America , if not in the world . Other speakers went into the history of its development and its purposes . Among these was George Foster Peabody , whom the Governor hailed as " that splendid pioneer of Saratoga as a health resort " and who was a member of the original commission appointed by Governor Charles Evans Hughes to start buying the springs and land . Mr. Peabody recalled the problems and worries of those early days when the thinking people of Saratoga and the State began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . Spa 's Equipment Described . Dr. Frederick E. Sondern , president of the Medical Society of the State of New York , described the purposes of the spa with its recreation centre , its spacious bath houses , its model hotel , golf course and swimming pool and its laboratory . He pointed out as unique the plan to provide sports for the patients , and the laboratory , in which the specific qualities of the various springs with the effect of the waters on patients suffering from many types of ailments will be studied . In concluding the Governor quoted from an address he made at the laying of the cornerstone of the Hall of Springs two years ago , in which he commented on the therapeutic treatment as follows : " No truer , finer service to humanity perhaps can be rendered than in making this unique treatment available . As scientific research proceeds , as technique is still further improved , as physicians qualify themselves still more highly in this therapy , Saratoga must come to a glory which she has never known in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other place in the world . I have a vision that here will grow a real boon to humanity that will give health , enjoyment and happiness to many . " Clear Day Favors Ceremony . The Governor , accompanied by Mrs. Lehman , his counsel , Charles Poletti , and Mrs. Poletti , and his secretary , Walter T. Brown , drove from Albany this afternoon . He was met in Saratoga Springs by Pierpont B. Noyes , president of the Saratoga Springs Authority , and drove at once to the reservation . After weeks of intermittent rain , the day was clear with not a cloud in the sky . The great park showed to perfect advantage . Laborers had been still at work surfacing lawns and planting trees . The Governor noted with surprise the progress that had been made since his last visit . On taking his seat the Governor was cheered and applauded . Mr. Noyes called upon the Right Rev. Thomas F. Davies , a Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Western Massachusetts , for the invocation . Mr. Noyes introduced members of the Authority and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NBC system . Governor Lehman 's address , in part , follows : " The number of springs taken over by the State at Saratoga between 1910 and 1912 was 163 . The lands surrounding them taken at the same time embraced nearly 1,000 acres ? an area that has been increased now to 1,200 acres , nearly two square miles . In these purchases and in the erection of the older baths , the Washington and the Lincoln , the State expended $4,000,000 . In this group where we are gathered today there has been an additional investment of $4,500 , - 000 ? truly an impressive aggregate , and truly eloquent testimony of the serious purpose of the State in setting about and accomplishing the development of a Spa . The cooperation of the Federal Government made possible and greatly hastened the consummation of our purpose . " But the significant and important thing is the character of that development . When I first knew Saratoga there was only haphazard use of the waters . People drank them as they chose , without regard for their differing character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much the same with respect to baths . Few thought seriously of prescription , and even fewer bothered to seek or to take the advice of a physician . Use Put on Scientific Basis . " Now the uses of the waters have been brought to the soundest possible medical and scientific basis . The most valuable ? and , I have been interested in learning from the reports to me , the most popular ? of the treatments offered at the Spa are given on prescription only . In the official statement of the Spa and the ' cures ' available at it , emphasis is laid on this declaration : ' The advice and direction of a physician are urged in all uses of the waters , whether external or internal . Only when these are had may the fullest benefits be secured . ' " The primary purpose of Saratoga Spa is as distinctive as the character of its development . This purpose is the treatment of chronic diseases  --  diseases of the heart and circulatory system , of the nervous system and of the gastro-intestinal tract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All these are conditions that do not always fall within the ordinary range of hospital service . They do not always fall within the range of sanitarium service . Saratoga Spa , then , supplements the institutions already in existence . It adds a great new agency to the armament of the private practitioner . State Promoting Common Welfare . " We ought to bear in mind , too , that chronic diseases , which do not run the swift course of acute diseases to recovery or to death , lay all the heavier burden on those who suffer from them . They lay all the heavier burden on the social body . They curb activity and achievement , they shorten years of usefulness , if not actually of life . Even to ameliorate these conditions is to restore happiness and opportunity and capacity for service to those who otherwise could not have these . " This , I think , is a true function of the State . Certainly it is in keeping with the fine tradition of New York , whose record of achievement , in behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so golden . " One thing more ought to be said regarding the activities of the new Saratoga Spa . It is not only a place for the chronically ill but for those who , although not afflicted with any organic or functional disorder , still are in need of rest and recuperation from unusual physical or nervous strain . " Governor Inspects Buildings . At the close of the exercises the Governor , accompanied by Mrs. Lehman , inspected the new buildings . Mr. and Mrs. Lehman went directly into the Hall of Springs , Saratoga 's equivalent to the traditional Drink House of the famous European spas . There they saw the three large circular fountains in which silver taps were being installed . There were no seats in the big pillared hall in which these fountains will spout when they are finished . It is the theory that when taking the waters internally , one should walk slowly about , sipping the while . From the Halt of Springs , which will be the last of the new buildings commissioned , the Governor walked through a colonnade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath houses , called the Roosevelt Baths . He next crossed the Mall to the east where Roosevelt Baths No. 2 stands . Visits Baruch Laboratory . Next the Governor visited the Simon Baruch Research Laboratory . This building , the largest of any of the units , is finished , but still unfurnished . Named in memory of Dr. Simon Baruch , American pioneer in hydrotherapy , this laboratory will house the Simon Baruch Research Institute . On its main floor are physicians ' offices and examination rooms , experimental baths for clinical study , a large museum , a mineral water laboratory and an auditorium with seating capacity for 600 . Governor Lehman was informed that in planning the laboratory the Authority had engaged Dr. I Franz M. Groedel , director of the ' Kerckhoff Institute for the Study of Affections of the Heart at BadNauheim , Germany , and other specialists as advisers . After completing his inspection of the laboratory and institute , Governor Lehman visited the recreation centre and the other two buildings , the State bottling works , where 12,000 bottles of the famous spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putnam Hotel , built by the State on the reservation and leased for private operation . At the recreation centre special exercises are provided for the invalids . It is the theory of Dr. Walter S. McClellan , medical director , that many spas are handicapped by the fact that the patients have little to amuse them . Hence , the spa will not only have amusements but exercises , which once were considered out of the range of invalids , especially persons suffering from heart ailments . Pool in Recreation Centre . The recreation centre has two gymnasiums , on the east side , a bathhouse at one end and a golf club at the other . On the west side is the entrance hall and offices with a cafeteria . In the centre is a swimming pool , 105 feet long and 45 feet wide . The plant is one of two outdoor swimming pools in this country in which the water is heated . The heating is done to provide swimming facilities for cardiac patients . The ' golf course was designed with ' the same purpose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has no grade of more than two degrees . Its bunkers and traps slope gradually . After a brief look at the bottling works , which it is expected will earn a considerable part of the income to amortize the Federal Government's.loan , Governor and Mrs. Lehman made a short call at the ' Gideon Putnam , named for a relative of the famous Connecticut Revolutionary soldier who came to Saratoga in 1802 and built the first log cabin for the use of persons patronizing the springs . Before dark Governor Lehman left the reservation by the drive leading down through the Vale of Springs , where long before the days of the white man the Mohawks , guardians of the Eastern door of the famed log house of the Five Nations , used to camp to bathe their wounds and drink the healing waters . Tonight the people of Saratoga Springs were celebrating the opening of their new spa with a big parade and street dancing . Tomorrow they will continue to celebrate with a historical pageant and on Sunday will close it with special services in the churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
