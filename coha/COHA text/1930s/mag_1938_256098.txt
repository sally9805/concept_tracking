Soviet newsorgans last week followed their reports of the " purge " ' conducted in the Soviet Far Eastern Army by War Commissar Kliment ( " Klim " ) Voroshilov with significant references to the previously unheard of " First Independent Far Eastern Red Army " and " Second Independent Far Eastern Red Army . " <P> It was assumed in Moscow that Commissar " Klim " had evidently split into two forces the single great Far Eastern Army previously commanded by Soviet Marshal Vasily Bluecher , who " disappeared " in the purge ( TIME , Oct. 17 ) . <P> Before Marshal Bluecher " disappeared " his authority was extended to unify under him the secret police of the Soviet Far East as well as its Red Army . To the All-Union secret police Chief Nikolai Yezhov , Commissar for Home Affairs in Moscow , this was a partial curtailment of authority , and likely was it that potent Yezhov helped to " break " Bluecher.
