High noon is rum time on the ships of the British Navy in temperate waters , from the dreadnaught Nelson to the little tug St. Abbs . In the tropics rum hour is 6 p. m . Then the seamen hear the quartermaster pipe , " Up spirits ! " Down in the mess the caterer slops into each seaman 's " basin " ( bowl ) one part rum in three parts water . The rum is mixed in a large tub around whose rim , in brass letters , are the words : " The King-God Bless Him . " On the King 's birthday all hands get a double ration of straight rum . First class petty officers get half rum , half water . Chief petty officers and warrant officers get straight rum . In the great 19th Century days of the British Navy , the man who passed up his rum ration and took the Government 's allowance of tuppence ( 4 ) instead , was looked on as " One of Aggie 's Men . " * After every victory the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times have changed with Britain and the British Navy . Last week the Admiralty announced that 60% of the men now pass up the rum for the tuppence . This is a particularly hard state of affairs since the rum costs the Navy less than a penny a portion . Cash handed out to abstainers represents a clear loss of one penny per day per abstainer . At the end of a month each abstaining British seaman has five shillings rum allowance with which he can buy a whole quart of cheap rum . <P> <P> *Agnes Weston , famed British temperance worker and self-styled " Sailor 's Friend , " died some ten years ago , aged 90.
