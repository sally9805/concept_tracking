The date was June 28 , 1914 , a memorable day , 25 years ago this week . It was the 550th anniversary , of the battle of Kossovo ( " the Field of Blackbirds " ) in which the Serbs lost their independence to the Turks . It was the day which Franz Ferdinand-Archduke of Austria-Este , Heir Apparent to the Austro-Hungarian throne-and his good Czech wife , Sophie , chose to visit Sarajevo , and it was the day when the trigger was pulled which set off World War I. <P> Franz Ferdinand was a barrel-chested , walrus-mustached man of 51 , unusually able and liberal by the standards of the Court which surrounded his aged uncle , <P> Emperor Franz Josef . A few days earlier , he had gone to witness Army maneuvers in Bosnia , a province whose patriotic aspirations he planned to satisfy , when he came to the throne , by giving it autonomy . <P> His personable wife Sophie , who was 46 , came to join him , and they put up at a hotel in Ilidze , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rained dismally on the maneuvers , but the morning of St. Vitus ' day dawned fair and fine . To celebrate it they had planned to pay a state visit to the provincial capital . <P> They arrived at Sarajevo just before 10 and paused to review a contingent of local troops . Then Franz Ferdinand got into a high-sided touring car with the top down . Sophie sat at his side and General Potiorek , the Governor of the Province , occupied a jump seat in front of them . The procession of four cars formed-one ahead and two behind them - and they drove on toward the Town Hall . <P> Sarajevo nestles between the hills in the valley of the Miljachka River . Its main thoroughfare , the Appel Quay , follows the river bank . The domes and minarets of Sarajevo 's 100 mosques gleamed white in the rain-washed air as the procession started up the quay toward the Town Hall ( see map ) . <P> Seven members of the straggling crowd did no cheering . All seven were native Bosnians , but three of them-young Gavrilo Princip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Belgrade , sent by the Ujedinjenje Hi smrt ( known as the " Black Hand " Society , sworn to reunite Bosnia and Serbia ) . They had bombs and revolvers to murder the Archduke , and during the three weeks , with the help of a local conspirator , Hitch , they had recruited and armed three Sarajevo youngsters to aid in the attempt . <P> Chabrinovitch took his post at the first bridge along the Archduke 's route , Princip at the second , Grabezh at the third . The four local bumpkins , quaking in their boots , were stationed near Chabrinovitch . They never got up their nerve to take part . <P> The imperial car drove slowly to give the peasants a good view . General Potiorek was pointing out some new barracks to the Archduke and his wife . The passengers did not see wild-eyed young Chabrinovitch take a small bomb from his pocket and knock off its cap against a post . But the chauffeur noticed and stepped on the gas . A small black object hurtled through the air , struck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then with a roar and a flash the bomb exploded . Several bystanders were injured . The Archduke 's aide , riding in the third car , was badly wounded . The time was about 10 a.m.
