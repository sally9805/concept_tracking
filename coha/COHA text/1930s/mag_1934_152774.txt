BELMONTE , THE MATADOR - Henry Baerlein-Smith &; Haas ( $3.50 ) . <P> " He is ugly , very ugly , with bowed shoulders , rather bandy-legged and with an excessive chin . But , gentlemen , he was made by God and when he begins with the cape and when he unfolds his marvelous muleta he reminds us of his divine origin . . . . " <P> So wrote Don Modesto of Madrid , most feared of bullfight critics , after seeing Juan Belmonte for the first time . For the 15 years ( 1912-27 ) of Belmonte 's ring career all Spain proudly echoed Don Modesto 's opinion . Biographer Baerlein goes even further , puts Belmonte on a level with Cervantes and Goya . Readers who liked Ernest Hemingway 's Death in the Afternoon will want to read this rambling Hispanophile book about Spain 's No. 1 modern matador . <P> Juan Belmonte , born in Seville , was the rickety son of an easygoing shopkeeper , whose shiftless ways landed his family in the poorhouse before his son 's fame brought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs were never any good , but when he and his cronies play-acted as matadors he was acknowledged the best . It was dangerous play : they swam the Guadalquivir at night , climbed into a bullpen and played the bulls naked , using their shirts as matadors ' capes . Banderillero Calderon took Belmonte under his wing , taught him everything he knew , made him walk every day to strengthen his feeble legs , carrying an iron rod . From the very beginning of his career Belmonte was frequently hurt : his bad legs made it impossible for him to run fast ; he always let the bull pass him too close for comfort , sometimes too close lor safety . He served a rough apprenticeship in the ring , fighting wherever and for whatever he could . With his first profits he rescued his family from the poorhouse . <P> Though Belmonte was beginning to be acclaimed in 1912 , a bullfight in Valencia that year paid him only 80 pesetas ; ni 1927 an afternoon in the same place netted him 35,000 . Credited with revolutionizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He worked closer to the bull than his predecessors , and he went to the bull wherever it happened to be ( previously certain parts of the arena had been considered impossibly dangerous for the matador ) . While he fought with what bullfight fans speak of as " emotion , " he aroused even more emotion in the gasping spectators . " . . . He avails himself of no advantage in the fight and at the end of it the horns go past him at the same two millimeters distance as at the beginning , for he does not use his legs . " In contrast with his friendly rival Joselito , who in the course of killing 1,557 bulls was badly gored only four times ( the last time fatally ) , Belmonte never passed through a season without at least one bad wound .
