txt Protest From the Northwest . To the Editor of The New York Timee : We people of Washington and Oregon are in the habit of referring to our country as the Northwest . Geographically , it can be nothing else , yet in Eastern papers we constantly see reference to the Northwest when it is the Middle West that is under discussion . One reads much of the unprecedented drought in the Northwest , when , as a matter of fact , this is one of the few sections where drought is unknown . If those suffering in the parched East could know of the blessed , cool green of Puget Sound Summers , where we think that we are sweltering if the thermometer reaches 82 and where we always sleep under blankets , this paradise soon would become overcrowded . And we complain bitterly in Winter if the temperature descends to 20 . NELL S. BURGHOFFER . Bellingham , Wash. , Aug. 24 , 1934.
