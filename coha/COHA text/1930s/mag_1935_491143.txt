SCORES who had been messengers , office boys or clerks were rising in the City Bank organization as we began the year 1914 . The 600 who worked there then worked hard , but they were not fear-ridden in the presence of the boss . I was the boss and they addressed me , a great many of them , affectionately . They called me Mr. Van . And I was proud . I was the coach and they were the team . Mr. Stillman , writing to me , frequently used another figure of speech . He would tell me that the bank was our mother . I was prepared then for years of growth , but not in my wildest dream did I have any vision of the fantastic expansion that was coming . On an afternoon late in July , 1914 , before there hail been any declaration of war , James Stillman stepped out of my office and stopped beside the desk of Ned Currier , my secretary , whom he liked . There was a pencil in his hand and through the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of Currier 's face as he exclaimed passionately , " The Germans can not violate my beautiful France ! " In the previous month , just before sailing for New York , Mr. Stillman had written me from Paris to say that banks were refusing credit and forcing merchants to pay up their notes . Money was closer than it had been since the Franco-Prussian War . He had been told by reliable parties that pearl necklaces of any considerable value could be purchased for cash at 60 per cent of what they formerly sold for . Such things were as significant to him as a falling barometer to an experienced mariner , yet he continued to hope for peace . AND BOYDEN SPARRES Later on this July afternoon , as we rode in my automobile from the city along the Hudson toward Scarborough , Mr. Stillman was clearly laboring under strain . He was to remain with me overnight . At Tarrytown he turned abruptly to Currier . " I ca n't stand this suspense any longer . Would you mind returning to New York ? " " Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to take my keys and go back to the bank . Get from my desk a little , red morocco-leather code book that I use for communicating with Lord Revelstoke , of Baring Brothers . Cable him , signing my code name . Ask if there will be war . " Currier could not get a train from Tarrytown before seven and would not reach the bank until about nine at night . By that time it would be two A.M. in London . There could not be any reply until morning . Nevertheless , Currier was characteristically cheerful and willing as he turned his back on his dinner . The next morning at the bank there arrived a cable message from London . It was from Lord Revelstoke , and when it had been decoded , Mr. Stillman read aloud to me : " War is inevitable . " Austria started war against Serbia on Tuesday ; by Friday , although actual war remained localized along the Serbian front , it was obvious that the situation of all nations was wholly critical . On the advice of bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There had begun at New York a heavy export of gold ; to get that gold European owners were selling out their American securities , and as always when sellers greatly outnumber buyers , prices were dropping . A fearful strain existed in every part of the financial mechanism . As in 1907 , the foremost problem was how to create an extraordinary amount of sound currency . Some of us began to think at once that arrangements should he made for the issuance of clearing-house certificates , but from Washington came word that William Gibbs McAdoo , the Secretary of the Treasury , desired that this should be avoided . He was confident that such a step would be unnecessary because of the greater elasticity given to our currency by the passage of the Aldrich-Vreeland Act . This untried measure was a forerunner of the Federal Reserve legislation . Under the provisions of the Aldrich-Vreeland Act , national banks were permitted , during an emergency , to take out national bank notes , temporarily , against the deposit of self-liquidating commercial paper  --  that is , loans made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a conference , in Washington , with representatives of the Clearing-House Association . Accordingly , on Friday night two men departed for the capital to talk with him . One was Francis L. Bine , the president of the First National Bank  --  Baker 's institution  --  who was president of the Clearing House Association ; the other was William Woodward , president of the Hanover National Bank , and who was acting chairman of the important clearinghouse committee in place of Albert H. Wiggin , who , as it happened , was in Europe at this time . Previously , in 1910 and 1911 , I had been a member of the clearing-house ( Continued on Page 32 ) ( Continued /rent Page 29 ) committee , and later on , in 1910. 1 was president of the ( leering House Assouialion ; but at this time , in 1914 , I had no official position with the organization . However , I was the president of the National Currency Association of the City of New York , which : was concerned primarily with putting into operation the emergency-eurrency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject , and I was disturbed when I heard that , in Washington , a point was being made of the fact that $500,000,000 of the Aldrich-Vreeland currency was printed and ready for shipment to national banks throughout the country . The big shock of currency demand would be felt in New York and I knew that , practically , only a small proportion of the emergency currency could be put to use in New York . The Aldrich  --  Vreeland Currency HE situation in regard to putting the Aldrich-1 Vreeland currency into circulation was not so simple as the Treasury officials seemed to believe . The mere fact that this currency was printed did not mean that it could be put into circulation . A bank could use the money only if it had self-liquidating loans which could be pledged against its use . And even if it did have such self-liquidating collateral , it did not follow that a bank would be disposed to resort to the new currency . Saturday brought to us the shocking news that Germany had declared war on Russia . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps should be taken to correct the Government 's too-optimistic view of what could be accomplished under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act . So I arranged for a conference at the Clearing House Association with those members of the committee who were still in New York . As I recall it , the gentlemen there were under the impression that there would be about $150,000,000 of the emergency currency available in New York on Monday morning . I argued that this could not be so , reminding them that the fact that the currency was printed did not warrant their belief that it would be used Each individual bank was an individual problem . It was necessary , it is true , first to have the currency printed . Each bank could use only the currency that bore its engraved name . It was further necessary that a bank should have self-liquidating assets ; and still further necessary that a hank in such a position should have the disposition to pledge its assets and secure the currency . The grand total of currency printed was not enough to indicate the success of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be studied . Eventually our discussion boiled down to a question as to precisely how much of the currency was available for New York City banks . Asa result I determined to get some firsthand information from one who had long been my eyes and ears in Washington ; that was Milton E. Ailes , then a vice president of the Riggs National Bank . I should explain now that Ailes was my devoted friend and operated for the City Bank in Washington a rather special service . He kept me posted and , furthermore , he wrote for our monthly circular all the data of legislation and Treasury Department orders which might be of interest to our correspondents and bond customers . Beyond these duties he performed important duties at the Treasury Department for our correspondents ; arranging for the withdrawal of bonds from deposit and the retirement of bank notes and similar matters . If the service was extraordinary , this was because Ailes was an extraordinary person . Important Inside Information B ORN in Shelby County , Ohio , and reared there by a school-teacher father , Ailes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a Treasury messenger . When I came there he was the secretary to an assistant secretary . I was prejudiced at first  --  he was a Bryan Democrat  --  but he was full of homely and humorous Lincolnesque stories of his boyhood ; he was capable and he was utterly loyal . Before long he became my secretary , and when I left the department to come to the City Bank , Mr. Gage arranged for him to be made my successor as assistant secretary . Ailes knew the Treasury Department as the average man knows the inside of his hat . From the clearing house I called Currier and directed him to talk with Ailes over the private telephone wire that linked the National City Bank with - ? rw March 9 , t938 the Riggs National in Washington . I told Currier to ask Ailes to find out precisely how much of the emergency currency was available for each New York bank . I specified that I wanted the information bank by bank , not merely a round sum . Late in the afternoon I got word from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $150,000,000 , as we had been led to believe , there was no more than $46,000,000 of emergency currency available for New York banks , and there was no certainty that each bank would use the full amount available for it . For some banks in a position to use much there was little ; for others that would make use of little there was excess . But how could McAdoo be mistaken ? " asked my associates on the clearing-house committee . I could only tell them at the moment how sure I was that we could rely on the figures sent by Milton Ailes . The fact was that he had gone directly to the custodian of the emergency cur rency . In the light of the figures compiled for me by Ailes , it was perfectly clear the situation called for the issuance of clearing-house certificates on Monday morning . In order to do that , it was necessary to call a meeting of representatives of all member banks . The call was issued for a meeting at nine-thirty on Monday morning . On Sunday the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sunday I went to a meeting of bankers ( Continued an Pas . 34 ) // ( Corti friat  --  d from Pamir 32 ) at the M etropoli ta a Club , Among those present were J. P. Morgan , Jr. , Harry Davison , Charlie Sabin , Gates McElarrah , James N. Wallace , J. S. Alexander , Clarence H. Kelsey , Stephen Baker , and numerous others . J. Pierpont Morgan , Sr. , had been dead for more than a year . Mr. Still13111.11 , shy always , remained at his house in 72nd Street and at intervals Currier talked with him over the phone . Morgan and Davison sat quietly , close to a window , looking out into Fifth Avenue . From time to time a fresh bulletin was read aloud , apprising us of some development overseas . We were waiting , all of us. for the return from Washington of Frank Hine and Will Woodward . They came ; and when the action of the day before  --  the decision to issue clearing-house certificates  --  was reported to them , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In good faith they had pledged their word to McAdoo that no clearing-house certificates would be issued , and it was small comfort to them to be told that McAdoo was basing his judgment on erroneous information . The result of our discussion was that we determined to ask McAdoo to come to New York and bring with him John Skelton Williams , Comptrollerof the Currency . As I was serving as chairman of the meeting , I directed Currier to telephone the invitation . He reported back in a little while that the two officials would leave Washington on the Congressional limited . Currier met them and brought them in my car to the Vanderbilt Hotel about nine o'clock Sunday night . Aside from these two Government officials and the bankers , the only other persons allowed to be within earshot of the proceedings on that carefully guarded floor were Currier and my chief stenographer , Errol Horner . Alerting a Money Emergency Well , we had a fine row . Mr. McAdoo , whose forcefulness I have always admired , was at first courteous in his insistence that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skelton Williams entered the discussion with a challenging manner that was hard to endure . " Just how much emergency currency is practically available , Mr. Williams ? " I asked him . His answer came like a roll of drums : One hundred and fifty-four million dollars , sir . " " Well , " I said , " your information does not coincide with the figures on the list that I have received from our correspondent bank in Washington . The amount yesterday afternoon was forty-six millions . The amount which will practieally be used is far less . " Both McAdoo and Williams were indignant at the suggestion that I pre-sinned to be better posted than themselves about the business of the Treasury Department . As our argument grew intense , this fact , in Williams ' eyes , took on vastly more significance than it deserved . I read off the amount of currency which was available for each bank . Every time I spoke an amount and named a bank , somewhere around the room an informed head nodded confirmation . My figures were irrefutable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he felt there was some impropriety in the fact that I was better informed than he was . Well , clearing-house certificates were issued , and they were needed . Without them we should have been in a fine mess ; probably some banks would have boon in serious difficulties . " Gold is trumps , " James Stillman cautioned me as he sailed for Europe in September , 1914 . He was never more right . London very much wanted about $98,000,000 due on a New York City bond issue ; it was wanted in gold . Everything in America that was owned in Europe seemed to be for sale as the war began . Those who sold wanted gold . That was the most cogent of the reasons for keeping the New York Stock Exchange closed month after month . There simply was not enough gold to buy back all our bonds and stocks that were owned abroad , and ff the attempt to do so had been made , it would have been as apparent in 1914 as it is in 1935 that the gold standard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to possess gold . With the Stock Exchange closed and stock and bond trading reduced to a small volume of illicit transactions , we managed to ride the storm . Mars Comes to Market Even if there had been no war , we would have had a tough time in 1914 ; indeed , the war saved the Wilson Administration from the blame for a serious domestic situation . Along with other factors , the Democratic tariff had increased unemployment to an alarming degree ; millions were out of work and the number was increasing . However , it was soon apparent to most business men that the war was going to create a fabulous market for American goods , for American labor and for American capital . I had been made chairman of a committee that raised a pool of $100,000,000 in gold to ship abroad to preserve American credit . Just as soon as it was known overseas that we had that gold and would ship it on demand , the demand eased . None of that $100,000,000 of gold was exported . What began to come over then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of horses were being bought by late September . The British Government had placed an order with the Studebakers for 8550,000 worth of farm wagons . I had learned of a $1,000,000 credit that was to be expended for nitroglycerin . These were but the first drops splashing down ahead of a rainstorm of orders . Those people overseas quickly ceased to want us to ship them gold ; they wanted something much more vital to them . They wanted to hire the productive energy of the most effectively industrialized nation that has ever existed ; they wanted to buy all the food that we would sell them ; they wanted everything that was required to keep them alive and to kill their enemies . And they wanted everything quickly . The one French word I never can forget is " rite . " Banking is an essential function in the existence of a society in which masses of individuals have removed themselves or are born away from the soil . The average man , I think , looks upon bankers as a group apart from the herd who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's breakfast really reaches him only because it has been constantly attended by banking processes . Somebody has to furnish credit to buy the wheat from the farmer ; there has to be credit first to build and then to operate the railroad that carries the wheat to an elevator and then to a miller ; and the miller has to have credit while transforming the wheat into flour , and then a baker has to have credit while he changes the flour into bread . These self-liquidating processes of commerce are the unseen forces by which chains of people are induced , in their proper turns , to co-operate in society , to serve others far removed from their presence . What is true in peace is true in war . The soldier generally gets his breakfast as a result of banking processes , and it is by those same processes that guns and ammunition are started on their way to a battlefield . In Washington President Wilson was striving to impose upon all citizens an obligation to be neutral not only in action but in mind . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From London , at a time when the French Government had abandoned Paris in the belief it could not long be defended against the Germans , Mr. Stillman wrote to me counseling neutrality ; it was a time to keep the bank " snug . " Well , Mr. Stillman was not neutral in his heart ; nor was 1 . Be -- sides , how could a big New York bank remain neutral ? We had accounts then with the biggest banks of all the belligerent nations . In Germany we had been having dealings with the Reichsbank , the Deutsche Bank and the Darmstadter Bank . Those accounts were closed out by wireless . It was significant of the close watch the Allies were keeping on all channels of communication that within a few days a. representative of the French Government thanked me very prettily for the action we had taken . By that time we were in the thick of negotiations designed to provide a big credit for the French Government . That undertaking nearly caused a row between the City Bank and Morgan &; Co . Financing Frame* Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French Government had sounded Morgan , Harjes &; Co. in Paris on the possibility of making arrangements through J. P. Morgan &; Co. for a credit of $100,000,000 in New York . I knew that Henry P. Davison , quite soon after the war began , had gone to Washington and discussed this proposal with William Jennings Bryan . What came of that was a telegram from Bryan to J. P. Morgan &; Co. in which he declared : " In the judgment of this Government , loans by American bankers to any foreign nation which is at war are inconsistent with the true spirit of neutrality . " The proposition was then brought to the doorstep of the City Bank by Maurice Ikon , a New York lawyer . As a result of our talks , I met Ambassador Jules Jusserand in Washington on October 5 , 1914 . With me was Sam McRoberts , one of our vice presidents and formerly the treasurer of Armour &; Co . Four days later I wrote to Jusserand outlining the conditions on which it would be possible for the French Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent basis , the money to remain on deposit here until spent ; all of this subject to the approval of the United States Government . M. Juseerand , beyond question , was dissatisfied at that time with the way Morgan &; Co. had dealt with their application for a loan.  - -  - Nevertheless , this was a situation calling for diplomacy of that kind which had enabled the City Bank and Morgan &; Co. to get along peaceably for so many yearn . I suppose that both McRoberts and I had a suspicion that they might not like the idea of having the City Bank hunting business on their international preserve . At any rate , intending to tell them tactfully of the deal we were about to close , McRoberts , because of my absence on account of illness , went down to see them . Apparently , through some of their extraordinary sources of information , the partners had learned all about our negotiations , and to say that they were indignant is understatement . Harry Davison explained that they felt the City Bank had usurped their position with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely understood among us to be a prerogative of Morgan &; Co . Jack Morgan spoke as forcefully as ever his father had done when the elder Morgan was aroused . It was not a pleasant situation . Troubled Waters In Wall Street McRoberts was distressed and did all he could to soothe our friends . He pleaded that we had understood we were free to proceed for the simple reason that Morgan &; Co. seemingly had determined not to go ahead . As a matter of fact we had been under the impression that the Morgan partners , with the French Government on the run , had not been displeased with the Bryan ruling that a loan to a belligerent nation would not be consistent with neutrality . However , Mr. Morgan and Mr. Davison made it more than clear to Mr. McRoberts that they were angry with us . On that same morning Charlie Rich went to the Morgans ' on some errand . He was one of our vice presidents and , when I first knew him , wars a Chicago Tribune office boy . He made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have not been active in it , " said Rich , " but I wanted to ask if you had any suggestions about the matter . " " Let me get Mr. Morgan , " said Lamont . J. P. Morgan , Jr. , emerged , angry . " If the Cif , Bank wo n't play the game with us , " he said , " we 'll disregard them in our operations  --  much as we 'd regret the end of an old friendship . " " Look , " said Rich ; " the friendship and co-operation of this house means more to us at the City Bank on the sentimental side alone than any other relationship . Unless we have your full accord , nothing will be done about this French loan . The whole thing is a misunderstanding ; we started into it more or less as an evolution of an original proposition that we should give credits to individual French banks . In the beginning we had no idea of dealing directly with the French Government . " Now , what Rich said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , and for similar reasons it was important when Jack Morgan walked up to Rich and in entire good humor slapped him on the back , saying : " We will get along all right . " We did get along , beautifully , and eventually the " prerogatives " that J. P. Morgan &; Co. had been concerned about took the form of an arrangement whereby they became the purchasing agents for the Allied Governments in the United States . In their establishment , for a long time , ( Confinuod in-Page 37 ) ( Continued from Pegg 341 there was an almost god-like knowledge of what the future held in store for those American industrial corporations that were in a position to make goods needed overseas . However , all during that critical time of a threatened break between the Morgans and the City Bank , I was at home , ill . In the midst of the negotiations with Jusserand I had been aware of an unusual lassitude and an occasional dizziness . What I had was paratyphoid . At the end of a month in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice of my friend , Dr. P. N. Barnesby , and go far away . There was a place out in California that I felt I ought to see ; a 16,000-acre ranch that I had bought , with others , sight unseen , as the traders say . The property was situated on the seacoast , partly within the limits of Los Angeles . When I did see it I came to a mental halt ; although I had become used to handling large projects , I was overwhelmed by this possession . It was almost the size of Manhattan Island ; beautiful rolling country ending at cliff where one might stand and gaze across a sapphire sea to the pastel tints of Catalina Island . There are fourteen miles of seacoast on the property . Exploring it , I grew strong again and became really grateful for the glibness of the real-estate agent who had come unintroduced to my office and sold it to me . I remained in California for several months . I can not fix the precise time when I became aware that what I wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am able to recapture my mood after my convalescence , as of February 12 , 1915 . To Mr. Stillman , on that day . I wrote : " I have been away from the office about three and a half months . I have , of course , by no means been out of touch with it , but the bank has been run by the staff and , to sum up a great deal that I might say , it has been run extremely well . Getting back gives me an impression of feeling as a farmer might ; supposing he had done a good deal of hard work plowing and harrowing , and sowing his wheat ; and then fancy him absenting himself from his fields until a day when the crop was just coming into full head , brilliant with promise and showing , beside the benefit of good planting , the effects of abundant rains and generous suushine . " You will think I am getting picturesque to be talking like this , but really I have never felt as I do now about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen . " New Pia= for the Bank That last statement was set down with the ecstasy of a prophet . A para. - graph from another letter to Mr. Stillman gives a hint of the wide sweep of our schemes in 1915 . " I feel , " 1 wrote , " that we have got the branch-bank situation working better now than at any time before . The group of people who have directly to do with the branch banks  --  Gardin , Voorhees , Kies , Green , of the International Banking Corporation , Jacobs , Farnham  --  now meet every day , and the whole scheme is being co-ordinated , and the combined judgment of all these officers is being applied to new questions . The plan is working capitally . We are giving serious attention to the matter of branches in Europe . We will not put a branch in Scandinavia , but Pyke returns there in a few days to open an office in Denmark , to be run on somewhat similar lines to the London office . I think we may open iu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy and determine later about that situation . " The bank by that time was filled with men of any own choosing . I was always on the lookout , and an offer from the City Bank was something calculated to tempt most men . Eventually it became almost a. habit to offer a man $25,000 to start ; a better salary depended on what he might show in the way of effort and intelligence . In my first years I brought in John Gar-din , then John H. McEldowncy , who had been my assistant on the Tribune ; and Sam McRoberts , Joseph Talbert , Charlie Rich and Jim Perkins . The Search for Banking Timber Perkins was an Albany banker when my attention was first directed to him . After I had completed an arrangement with Perkins to come with us as a vice president , I spoke about him to two in the bank who at once became almost delirious with joy . Jimmy Stillman , a vice president himself , had been at Harvard when Perkins was there ; both on the crew . Currier had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerning Perkins , I wrote to Mr. Stillman , on June 5 , 1914 , a prophecy that " his selection will be one of the best things I have ever been able to do for the bank . " Twenty years after , James Perkins had become chairman of the board of the City Bank . The bank was growing , growing , growing . As the war progressed , our foreign branches  --  the first had been opened in 1914 ? developed faster than we could find trained men to run them . Something quite apart from the needs of the Allied armies was tempting us into a fantastic expansion . The bulk of European exports had stopped and there was a correspondingly great world demand for everything the fighting nations formerly had been accustomed to make and sell . The City Bank 's great need then was for American men trained in foreign-banking business ; for cultured professional bankers , able to speak and write and think in several languages  --  and such men were rare . I scoured the world for the right kind of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian banker . In Texas , the president of the First National of Houston had qualities we wanted . I went down to see him , and Herbert Eldridge became a. vice president of the City Bank . He was just the man to supervise our foreign branches . But while crossing the Andes on his first tour of the South American branches , Eldridge 's heart failed him ; he died on the train . He was not easily replaced . I remember being at a National Industrial Conference Board meeting up in the Catskills where I encountered a man named F. Charles Schwedtman , a part-Dutchman , German-born electrical engineer . He had never been associated with a bank , but I was captivated by his philosophy of life , by his intelligent , broad and fair-minded attitude toward industry and people . He had just concluded the handling of some industry out in Illinois for Chicago banks and was considering a position as an adviser of the Chinese Government . " This man , " I thought , " would be useful to the City Bank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately he became a vice president . I ( Continued on Pegg 39 ) ( Continui  --  d from Pag ? 37 ) counted on him heavily in the development of a , scheme I had for the creation in the City Bank of a kind of super-West Point for the training of selected young men . We had fifteen of these college men in 1915 ; later we had sixty . In explaining to Mr. Stillman my hopes for those financier cadets , I wrote : " They live in a community house in Brooklyn and are being put through the different departments of the bank ; and in addition to their day 's work in the bank , have classes in practical banking that are conducted in a way that will really give them a broad insight into the business . We are paying them only fifty dollars a month , which is , perhaps , too low , but we are giving them a very extraordinary opportunity to /earn . " A University of Banking " The way banks have been run , in feeding their executive force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a development of some exceptional mind , is about on a par with the old-fashioned way of farming , where a man used the small potatoes for seed and sold the large ones . The modern farmer gives as much attention to his seed , to the careful selection of corn that has developed the best characteristics , to the selection of potatoes that have grown the most to the hill , as he does to cultivation after the crop is in the ground . That is just what we are doing now in the bank , and instead of having to trust to some boy here and there with only a grammar-school education developing exceptional capacity , we are getting young men in with trained minds , of good families , and with a vision that banking is a profession instead of merely a job . " We have made arrangements with a number of the leading colleges by which they will present to us for selection some picked men at the end of the sophomore year . We plan to take men from perhaps a half dozen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summers of their sophomore and junior years , and take them on permanently in the middle of their senior year . The instruction will be such that the colleges will give academic credit for a half year 's work and the men will be graduated after they have put in the last half of their senior year in the bank . . . . It will furnish a picked lot of men , particularly for foreign service , who are educated and will be adapted to that field , and it will give the bank a unique position as being the training school for bankers . " In 1915 , certain developments , one of which was the frailty of Mr. Still-man 's health , made me conclude it was high time I took some steps to secure my own fortune . I was well-to-do , yes ; but I wanted to be fixed to maintain myself in the job I had . It entailed an expensive life . Moreover , I had some excuse for entertaining a notion of riches different than that of most ; during fourteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Stillman , Morgan , Prick , Carnegie , Baker , Harriman , William Rockefeller and others . I occupied one of the most conspicuous banking positions in the world and my salary was $100,000 a year . Does that seem a terrific sum of money ? In six months of 1915 the enterprise under my command had net earnings of $3,408,000 . Right now I alai prepared to defend in debate the proposition that the one who is capable enough to manage successfully an enterprise like the National City Bank is worth much more than $100,000 . To me it seems silly of Government officials to say that no railroad president is worth more than $60,000 a year . Some of this is beside the point . Here we have to dwell upon something else : a matter of the ego . Consider who owned this bank to the service of which I was devoting all my energies , mental and physical . By far the largest stockholder was Mr. Stillman ; he owned about 52,000 shares . The Morgan firm owned a big block of stock , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably more than my own modest interest . Among these were the Pynes . At intervals I had tried to buy some of the holdings of these others . But the first real success I had was when Mr. Morgan told me he was disposed to let me have perhaps half of the Morgan interest in the City Bank . A day or so after my conversation with him , an assassin forced his way into the home of Mr. Morgan at Glen Cove on Long Island and began firing a revolver at him ; one bullet struck the financier in the abdomen . That was when I determined to express my mind to Mr. Stillman , who , I knew , could live only a few years longer ; he knew it too . " What I want to write about , " I explained in my letter , " I have had more or less on my mind for five years ; but just as a drop of the right reagent will precipitate a chemical compound from a glass of clear liquid , so the extremely narrow escape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions in regard to what I am going to write to you about . I will take occasion in another letter to tell you all the details of the attempt to murder Mr. Morgan , and the chance in a thousand by which he escaped . My reason for mentioning it is that it has brought most forcefully to me the chances that go with my own responsibilities . They are chances which it is better not to think of at all , and ordinarily I do not think of them . I do not at all mean alone the chances of such an incident as an encounter with a hare-brained crank myself , nor , I think , do I need to go into detail as to all the chances that one must take , of every nature , in such a position as this . I only cite , as my excuse for writing this letter , the fact that I have been having a flashligh t revelation as to the responsibilities which I have in regard to a large family and a quite reasonable desire , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means properly to safeguard that responsibility for the future . " I Learn About Santa Claris ' What I then asked Mr. Stillman to do was to give me an option running not less than five years on a big block of his City Bank stock . I made no argument whatever as to the price ; the amount of stock was the important thing to me , and I so explained . I also reminded Mr. Stillman of a conversation in the previous summer from which I had gathered the impression that he would he willing to eacry the Morgan stock for me if I could got it . Now , I had no hope of owning permanently as large an interest in the City Bank as I was striving to get under option . I hoped to make enough on the transaction  --  I was fully persuaded the City Bank stock was the safest investment , and the biggest bargain , in the world  --  to be able to buy outright a smaller but substantial interest in the bank . Shortly after I sent my letter , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 10,000 shares of City Bank stock . I had a difficult time buying those 10,000 shares ; approximately $4,000,000 was involved , to be paid at intervals during about eight months . William Rockefeller thought I ought to divide that stock with Mr. Rockefeller ; in a somewhat less vigorous degree , Mr. Stillman thought I ought to divide with Mr. Stillman . They were willing to help me carry the stock if I divided , but , I was informed , they could not see their way clear to do so if I did not divide . I had depended wholly upon Mr. Stillman to carry that stock for me , and when he did not , I was left in one of the most embarrassing situations of my life . I had arranged to pay on a certain date $1,000,000 for the first 2500 shares ; unless I did so , the options on the other 7500 shares were forfeited . The day name and I did not have the million . I had discovered , at the age of fifty-one , that Santa . Claus was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude by carrying the stock for me until I was ready to take it up . I took it all up , rather grimly . A Chip Off the Ofd Block However , I then owned 12,500 shares ; more than Morgan , and more than William Rockefeller . Frank Vanderlip had become the second largest stockholder of the National City Bank . William Rockefeller was my neighbor ; imposing Rockwood Hall  --  now a country club  --  and Beechwood lie fairly close together up the Hudson . He was in all circumstances a most polite man , and it is likewise in his favor that he had a sense of humor . He came to the bank iii great glee one time after a walk about his North Tarrytown estate in the company of his namesake grandson . " William , " he had told the boy , " I am going to give you an acre of ground here on the estate . You are to own it and administer it . Pick out the acre you want . " " An acre , grandfather ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The one with the house on it ! " My favorite Rockefeller story concerned a day when that same precocious grandson was being guided through the Jekyl Island clubhouse . The old gentleman showed the boy a display of stuffed and mounted birds all of which at some time or other had been shot on the island . " That 's a wild turkey , " explained Mr. Rockefeller , " and that 's a quail , and that 's an owl . " Finally they paused in front of the prize of the collection , " There , " he said impressively , " is an eagle . " " What ? " exclaimed the smallest Rockefeller . " Why , grandfather , that 's just an old bird . I thought an eagle was a gold piece . " Mr. Rockefeller was keen for money , but , after all , it was pretty hard not to be'in Wall Street . He came in to argue with me when I was engaged in organizing the American International Corporation . He wanted $5,000,000 of the stock and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to tell how that venture began . One day when I remained at Scarborough , Jim Perkins telephoned that he wanted to send out to see me two ( Conelnuvd on Pak. 411 ( Continued from Page 39 ) railroad contractors named Stone and Webster ; they had fascinated him ; he thought they might also fascinate me . They did , completely . These men had done well , but were convinced that there was not much more railroad building to be done in the United States . After looking over the world for a land that was thickly populated , but lacking railroads , they had come to the conclusion that China was the place . The next morning at the bank , Stone , Webster , Perkins , Rich and I had another talk . It was all quite intoxicating , but there came an interval of silence and Perkins looked at me . " All right , " I said , " we will shoot . " And that was the way we conceived the American International Corporation . We had decided that what was needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign business enterprise of great possibilities or even a good idea with management behind it and finance it into strength . Such an organization would be in a position to consider carefully some of the marvelous opportunities that a banker ordinarily would have to boot out of his path for sheer lack of time . I , for example , for $10,000 , could have had a half interest one time in an industry out in Toledo . The Stranahan brothers wanted that sum to help them get started with what became the Champion Spark Plug Company , and my $10,000 would have become $25,000 , - 000 or more . New Paths to Business Well the American International Corporation had $50,000,000 of capital authorized ; it was to be interested in all manner of promising enterprises in foreign lands  --  in the Orient , in South America , over the face of the whole earth . The very idea of the thing was exciting in Wall Street . We made C. A. Stone the president and had a remarkable board of directors  --  James J. Hill , Theodore Vail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otto Kahn , Ambrose Monell , James A.Stillinan , Beekman Winthrop , Henry S. Pritchett , R. S. Lovett , Joseph P. Grace , Cyrus H. McCormick , Charles II . Sabin , W. E. Corey , J. Ogden Armour and C. A. Coffin . What days those were ! One can be reconstructed from a letter I wrote to Mr. Stillman : " James A. Farrell and Albert Wiggin have been invited " on the board " but had to consult their committees before accepting . I also have in mind asking Henry Walters and Myron T. Herrick . Mr. Herrick is objected to by Mr. Rockefeller quite strongly , but Mr. Stone wants him and I feel strongly that he would be particularly desirable in France . The whole thing has gone along with a smoothness that has been gratifying , and the reception of it has been marked by an enthusiasm which has been surprising to me , even though I was so strongly convinced we were on the right track . " I saw James J. Hill today , for example . He said at first that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after I had finished telling him what wo expected to do , he said he would be glad to go on the board , would take a large amount of stock and , particularly he wanted a substantial interest in the City Bank , and commissioned me to buy him the stock at the market . " How an Idea Grew " I talked with Ogden Armour about the matter today for the first time . He sat in perfect silence while I went through the story , and , without asking a single question , be said he would go on the board and wanted $500,000 stock . " Mr. Coffin " of General Electric " is another man who is retiring from everything , but has become so enthusiastic over this that he was willing to go on the board , and offers the most active co-operation . " I felt very good over getting Sabin . The Guaranty Trust is altogether the most active competitor we have in the field and it is of great value to get them into the fold in this way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They want to take up to $2,500,000 . There was really quite a little competition to see who should get on the board , but as I had happened to talk with Kahn and had invited him first , it was decided he should go on . He is perhaps the most enthusiastic of anyone . They want half a million stock for Sir Ernest Cassel , to whom they have cabled the plan , and they have back from him approval of it . " I explained the whole matter to the Board " of the City Bank ! " Tuesday and got nothing but favorable comments . " Joe Grace had wanted 5600,000 of the stock beside what he would get through his City Bank stock ownership ; Monell wanted half a million , and Corey , Converse and the rest of the Midvale Steel people wanted large amounts . George Baker wanted $ ' 250 , - 000 , Frank Hine $100,000 and William Rockefeller tried , vainly , to get me to put him down for $5,000,000 of the common . There were a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beforeone . I remember that the Pynesand the Taylors asked me to see what could be done with Lackawanna Steel ; they had 160,000 shares . I got in touch with James Campbell , then the head of Youngstown Sheet &; Tube Company , and we schemed out a possible combination of his company with the Lackawanna , the Iroquois in Chicago , and the Cambria . It was like working a jigsaw puzzle out of squirming pieces . The one that got away that time was Cambria Steel . I had arranged to join with Mr. Frick , Mr. Mellen and Horace Harding in buying 250,000 shares of Cambria owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad . Before we could act , other interests closed a deal . Just before that I had arranged on my own account a $13,000,000 credit in order to accomplish the purchase and sale of Midvale Steel . At the same time I was trying to buy from J. B. Forgan control of the Haskell &; Barker Car Company . In 1915 , of course , those were the kind of industries that could make the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ; stock sufficient for control was tied up for ninety days under an option agreement given to Shearson , Hammill &; Co. , who were conducting the matter . I had paid for a considerable amount of the underwriting . The Eve of a Change I put all this down in order to explain something that I tried to make clear in my letters to Mr. Stillman in January , 1916 . I believed then that my chief work for the future was to be the co-ordination of the efforts of four organizations ? the National City Bank , the International Banking Corporation , the National City Company and the American International Corporation . " This , " I told Mr. Stillman , " has brought me to the very clear belief that the time has come for me to retire from the presidency of the City Bank . " I desired to take the chairmanship of the other three companies and at the City Bank to become vice chairman of the board . That was so as not to disturb Mr. Stillman in the chairmanship .
