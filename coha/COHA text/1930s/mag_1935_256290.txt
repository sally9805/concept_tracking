Last week railroad stocks sold down to a new low since April 1933 . January earnings were thoroughly depressing . Though gross revenues were up slightly , net operating income of the first 51 roads to report showed a drop of 22% . That was a pronounced extension of a trend that set in during 1934 when the 147 Class I carriers reported a gain of nearly 6% in gross revenues , but a decrease of 2% in net . Plainly , the U. S. Railroad System was boxed in its race against rising costs . <P> As a whole the U. S. railroads failed to earn their fixed charges last year by $35,000,000 . No less than 30 failed to earn their out-of-pocket operating expenses . Of course , many a road like Pennsylvania , Union Pacific , Atchison , Chesapeake &; Ohio , Virginian and Bangor &; Aroostook earned not only fixed charges but dividends besides , but the great majority were deep in the red . A wage increase of 5% will take effect in April , topping two preceding raises of 2% since last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones might assure the carriers , as he did last week , that his RFC would continue to lend on acceptable security , there is a bottom to even the best road 's strong box . Furthermore , Mr. Jones sometimes depresses investors , as he did last week , with peremptory demands that debt-ridden roads reorganize . <P> Day by day as stock and bond quotations melted , railroad investors grew fearful that some headline calamity was imminent . One Southern Railway ( mileage : 8,017 ) bond issue dropped eight points in a single session , and New York , New Haven &; Hartford ( mileage : 2,072 ) issues sank five points to new lows for the year , around 25 or 30 on the dollar . New Haven 's new president Howard S. Palmer , who succeeded John Jeremiah Pelley last autumn , felt obliged to announce : " We are not contemplating any reorganization at this time . " <P> More notable was a pronouncement from Southern , not because of its content but because any statement from President Fairfax Harrison is so rare as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 , with a name that works magic throughout the South , Mr. Harrison divides his time between his country seat at Belvoir in Virginia 's Fauquier County and the Washington headquarters of his road , writes learned treatises on Roman farm management under the pseudonym " A Virginia Farmer . " Though he has lately given up reading daily newspapers as a waste of time , President Harrison last week unbent enough to give the Press nine words : " There are no financial difficulties facing the Southern Railway . " <P> With reassurance from Messrs . Palmer &; Harrison , railroad securities rallied briskly . But for the rest of the week there was a deluge of railroad news , good &; bad : <P> RFChairman Jesse Jones announced a final plan for his pet railroad project , partitioning of Minneapolis &; St. Louis ( mileage : 1,627 ) which has been in receivership for twelve years ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) . About 500 mi. of this decrepit carrier will be junked , the rest parceled out among eight adjacent systems . Though details were still secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiring a direct entrance over its own rails into Minneapolis . Mr. Jones will provide the big carriers with a total of $7,200,000 to buy the individual pieces .
