Once the most heroic living name in the U. S. , Lindbergh is now a hated word in Communist , Jewish and other anti-Nazi groups . With Charles Augustus Lindbergh taking Nazi medals and househunting in Berlin , Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc. , last week paid the new anti-Lindberghism the deference of dropping its soubriquet of " The Lindbergh Line . " <P> For a fortnight or more Lindbergh-haters had been putting the heat on T. W. A. Letters and wires poured in ; Manhattan 's Daily Worker boomed the drive . Gossip columnists noted its progress . Result was that in the December Official Aviation Guide ( in which the lines pay $15 a page for blurb and timetable space ) , nowhere in T. W. A. 's eleven pages could the name of Lindbergh be found . The Transcontinental route Lindbergh charted ten years ago is now " The Sunny Santa Fe Trail , " and the credit line reads : " Nature made it .
