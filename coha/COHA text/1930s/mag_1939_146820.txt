" On January 26th , 1896 , I entered your institution . I am ashamed to say that for five years I had drunk one quart of whiskey a day . On January 28th , 1896 , I took my last drink . " So runs a typical testimonial to the once-famous Keeley Institute in the cornbelt town of Dwight , Ill. , long a Mecca for drunkards who wanted to get out of John Barleycorn 's clutches . <P> Last week the Keeley Institute celebrated its 60th anniversary . Before a small crowd of enthusiastic but sober alumni , Director James Henry Oughton Jr . unveiled a bronze plaque of Founder Leslie E. Keeley , a Civil War surgeon who announced his cure in 1879 . With his famed slogan , " Drunkenness is a disease and I can cure it , " and his " secret " injections of gold chloride , Dr. Keeley amassed a fortune of over $1,000,000 . During the ' gos , Keeley clubs flourished all over the U. S. , proud Keeley alumni sported shiny gold buttons , preached excitingly confessional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Keeley routine . An incoming inebriate pays $160 , plus room and board , must stay for 31 days . His whiskey ration is gradually tapered off : eight ounces the first day , six ounces the second , four ounces the third , none from then on . Four times a day he gets gold chloride injections ; every two hours he takes a tonic . At the end of the course , Keeley Drs . Robert Estill Maupin , Bert Trippeer and Andrew Jackson McGee look him over , ask him if he still feels the " irresistible craving of nerve cells for alcohol . " Usually he says no . How many of the 400,000 Keeley graduates have stayed cured , Director Oughton does not know , for he has no means of checking up . Although most physicians now believe that drunkards are neurotics and can not be cured by injections , Keeley stoutly boasts that it has cured 17,000 drunken doctors since it first opened its doors .                  @ @ @
