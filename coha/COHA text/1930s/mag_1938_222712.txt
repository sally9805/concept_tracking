To stern U. S. demands that American businessmen and missionaries be allowed to reclaim their property , operate freely in the Japanese-controlled Lower Yangtze Valley , Japan last week had a pliant answer . In his stiff note Secretary of State Cordell Hull cited as an " illustrative case " the $1,000,000 Baptist-owned University of Shanghai , occupied since last August by the Mikado 's troops , its campus turned into an airport . Day after the note 's delivery , Baptists , a U. S. consular representative , Japanese military and consular authorities witnessed the return of two " middle schools " belonging to the Southern Baptist Mission . Japan also permitted ten missionaries to return to charred and raped Nanking , but gave no date when the $1,500,000 American-owned university there could be opened . <P> Of $200,000,000 invested in China by U. S. nationals , a large part is in the Yangtze Valley , only a conservatively estimated $41,904,889 is in missionary or philanthropic property . Chief U. S. complaint since the war has been that Japanese merchants operate freely in those areas , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to be in residence . Plain U. S. implication was that Japan was repeating her Manchurian policy of closing the Chinese " open door , " was allowing her own businessmen to clean up in territory " unsafe " for U. S. salesmen and promoters .
