M. yesterday in the 4-year-old gasoline-engined craft . They reached Greenport at 9:30 A. M. and tied up to the dock of the Colonial Gasoline Company at the foot of First Street to refuel . R. I. Scohley , the manager of the station , had given the cruiser 140 gallons of gasoline and had left the dock and returned to his office about 150 feet away . Captain White , who had been engaged by Richman to pilot the party to near-by fishing grounds , was at the wheel of the boat in the cockpit .
