French sportsmen are pleased and exhilarated over a new sport at the Riviera 's foremost summer resort , swank Juan-les-Pins-races of thoroughbred cockroaches . Bookmakers cover bets of thousands of francs on each roach race . Racing roaches run in narrow tracks covered with glass . Each roach is numbered with white ink . At the starting line they are restrained by transparent covers . At the finish line is a large black box , invitingly open . At the starting signal a strong light is switched on behind the roaches , their covers removed . Mortally hating bright lights , the roaches run for the darkness of the boxes at the other end of the tracks . Last week 's bitterest rival cockroaches were Mick the Miller , named for a famed British racing greyhound , and Man o'War , whose namesake was one of the greatest of U. S. racehorses.
