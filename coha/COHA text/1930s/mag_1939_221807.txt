Old Quaker , " A Friendly Whiskey , " has been made in the U. S. for 50 years . Today it is marketed by a subsidiary of Schenley Distillers Corp . Some members of the Society of Friends object mildly to Quaker Oil , Quaker Oats , the Quaker Line , Quaker Novelty Puffing . But they object vigorously to Old Quaker whiskey . They object to Old Quaker 's implicit identification with the " purity and integrity " of the Quaker faith . They resent the implication that Quakers drink ; they are n't supposed to . The Society is displeased that the Old Quaker trademark is a picture of William Penn , standard-bearer of Quakerism in America ; that some Schenley advertisements have featured a photograph of a whiskey drinker in Quakerish dress . Last week , as mad as members of a mild , tolerant sect can be , some Friends proposed to do something about the whiskey . <P> Quakers began hectoring Schenley several years ago . Although it had no intention of yielding its 50-year-old name , a valuable property , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaker 's picture , to kill him off completely at the first opportunity . To Friends , however , the Old Quaker still looks pretty big and bibulous . Friend Malcolm Read Lovell , authorized by a Manhattan Quaker meeting to study the problem , suggested a boycott-by others . For an effective boycott of a whiskey by teetotaling Quakers was a bit of a problem . Mr. Lovell 's solution : to circularize other churches , civic clubs , Rotarians , Kiwanis , Lions , fraternal organizations , sportsmen 's clubs , with an explanation of Quaker ideals , urging them to do the Quakers ' boycotting for them .
