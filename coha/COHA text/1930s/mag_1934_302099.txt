My Dear Children <P> I am very anxious that you should know something about the History of Jesus Christ . For everybody ought to know about Him . No one ever lived , who was so good , so kind , so gentle , and so sorry for all people who did wrong , or were in any way ill or miserable , as He was . And as He is now in Heaven , where we hope to go , and all to meet each other after we are dead , and there be happy always together , you never can think what a good place Heaven is , without knowing who He was and what He did . <P> Thus last week in 180 U. S. and Canadian newspapers began Charles Dickens ' The Life of Our Lord , completed in 1849 for the private pleasure and instruction of his children . Its publication , after 85 years , was regarded by United Feature Syndicate as one of the big news scoops of the era . When , after two weeks , the 14,000-word story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work will have been made public . <P> For the world rights to the manuscript , the London Daily Mail paid $210.000 to the widow and family of Sir Henry Fielding Dickens , last of the ten Dickenses to die . For an unnamed price , United Feature bought North &; South American serial rights . Second publishing rights were to be sold to smaller papers up to May 15 , when Simon &; Schuster will issue The Life of Our Lord in book form . <P> Readers of the first installment were prepared by an editorial note for " inconsistencies in punctuation and spelling which appeared in the original manuscript , intended by Dickens only for the eyes of his children and not for the printer . " What they were not prepared for was the anti-Fundamentalist credo in the second paragraph : <P> He was born a long time ago-nearly Two Thousand years ago-at a place called Bethlehem . His father and mother lived in a City called Nazareth , but they were forced , by business to travel to Bethlehem . His father 's name was Joseph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great was the name of Dickens , however , that few churchmen took offense . " The time for the publication of The Life of Our Lord could not be more opportune , " rejoiced General Secretary S. McCrea Cavert of the Federal Churches of Christ . " Many people , " agreed Dean Luther Allan Weigle of the Yale Divinity School , " will read this because Charles Dickens wrote it and it will help to make many acquainted with the life of our Lord . " <P> Five million members of Dickens clubs hoped The Life of Our Lord would start a Dickens revival . Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has already announced a film version of David Copperfield.
