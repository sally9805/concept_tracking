Illustration : He jumped -- directly over the Gorm ! Pirates of the Gorm By Nat Schachner * * * * * Sidenote : The trail of vanished space ships leads Grant Pemberton to a marvellous lake of fire . Grant Pemberton sat up suddenly in his berth , every sense straining and alert . What was it that had awakened him in the deathly stillness of the space-flier ? His right hand slid under the pillow and clutched the handle of his gun . Its firm coolness was a comforting reality . There it was again . A tiny scratching on the door as though someone was fumbling for the slide-switch . Very quietly he sat , waiting , his finger poised against the trigger . Suddenly the scratching ceased , and the panel moved slowly open . A thin oblong patch glimmered in the light of the corridor beyond . Grant tensed grimly . A hand moved slowly around the slit -- a hand that held a pencil-ray . Even in the dim illumination , Grant noted the queer spatulate fingers . A Ganymedan ! In the entire solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his berth like a flash . Not a moment too soon , either . A pale blue beam slithered across the blackness , impinged upon the pillow where his head had lain only a moment before . The air-cushion disintegrated into smoldering dust . Grant 's weapon spat viciously . A hail of tiny bullets rattled against the panel , and exploded , each in a puffball of flame . But it was too late . Already the unknown enemy was running swiftly down the corridor , the sucking patter of his feet giving more evidence of his Ganymedan origin . Pemberton sprang to the door , thrust it open just in time to see a dark shape disappearing around a bend in the corridor . There was no use of pursuit ; the passageway ended in a spray of smaller corridors , from which ambush would be absurdly easy . * * * * * HE glanced swiftly around . The corridor was empty , silent in the dim , diffused light . The motley passengers were all sound asleep ; no one had been disturbed by the fracas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ganymedans and homeward-bound Callistans , all reposing through the sleep-period in anticipation of an early landing in Callisto . All were asleep , that is , but one . That brought Pemberton back to the problem of his mysterious assailant . Why had this Ganymedan tried to whiff him out of existence ? Grant frowned . No one on board knew of his mission , not even the captain . On the passenger list he was merely Dirk Halliday , an inconspicuous commercial traveler for Interspace Products . Yet someone had manifestly penetrated his disguise and was eager to remove him from the path of whatever deviltry was up . Who ? Grant gave a little start , then swore softly . Of course ! Why had n't he thought of it before ! The scene came back to him , complete in every detail , as though he were once more back on Earth , in the small , simply furnished office of the Interplanetary Secret Service . The Chief of the Service was glancing up at him keenly . Beside him was a tall , powerfully shouldered Ganymedan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a faint distaste as he sat there , drumming on the arm of his chair with his spatulate fingers , his soft-suction padded hoofs curled queerly under the seat . There was something furtive , too , about the red lidless eyes that shifted with quick unwinking movements . * * * * * But then , Pemberton had small use for the entire tribe of Ganymedans . Damned pirates , that 's all they were . It was not many years back since they had been the scourge of the solar system , harrying spatial commerce with their swift piratical fliers , burning and slaying for the mere lust of it . That is , until an armada of Earth space-fliers had broken their power in one great battle . The stricken corsairs were compelled to disgorge their accumulations of plunder , give up all their fliers and armament , and above all , the import of metals was forbidden them . For , strangely enough , none of the metallic elements was to be found on Ganymede . All their weapons , all their ships , were forged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years since Ganymede had been admitted once again to the Planetary League , after suitable declarations of repentance . But the prohibitions still held . And Grant placed small faith in the sincerity of the repentance . The Chief was speaking . " We 've called you in -- Miro and I , " he said , in his usual swift , staccato manner , " because we 've agreed that you are the best man in the Service to handle the mission we have in mind . " Grant said nothing . " It 's a particularly dangerous affair , " the Chief continued . " Five great space-fliers , traveling along regular traffic routes , have all vanished within the space of a month -- passengers , crews and all . Not a trace of them can be found . " " No radio reports , sir ? " " That 's the most curious part of the whole business . Everyone of the fliers was equipped with apparatus that could have raised the entire solar system with a call for help , and yet not the tiniest whisper was heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paced the floor agitatedly . It was plain that this business was worrying him . Miro continued to sit calmly , seemingly indifferent . " It 's uncanny , I tell you . Gone as though empty space had swallowed them up . " " You 've applied routine methods , of course , " Grant ventured . " Of course , " the Chief waved it aside impatiently . " But we ca n't discover a thing . Battle fliers have patrolled the area without success . The last ship was literally snatched away right under the nose of a convoy . One minute it was in radio communication , and the next -- whiff -- it was gone . " " Where is this area you mention ? " Already Pemberton 's razor-edged brain was at work on the problem . " Within a radius of five million miles from Jupiter . We 've naturally considered placing an embargo upon that territory , but that would mean cutting off all of the satellites from the rest of the system . " Miro stirred . His smooth slurred voice rolled out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has already suffered too much . " He evoked a sigh from somewhere in the depths of his barrel chest , and tried to cast up his small red eyes . Grant suffered too , a faint disgust . Damn his eyes , what business had an erstwhile pirate , not too recently reformed , being self-righteous ? " Miro thinks , " the Chief continued unheeding , " that the Callistans know more about this than they admit . He has a theory that Callisto is somehow gathering up these ships to use in a surprise attack against his own planet , Ganymede . He says Callisto has always hated them . " " Damn good reason , " Grant said laconically. * * * * * Miro 's lidless eyes flamed into sudden life . " And what do you mean by that , my friend ? " Pemberton replied calmly . " Simply that your people have harried and ravaged them for untold centuries . They were your nearest prey , you know . " Miro sprang to his feet , his soft suction pads gripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sanctimonious unction of his former behavior ; the ruthless savage glared out of the red eyes , the flattened fingers were twisting and curling . " You beastly Earthling , " he cried in a voice choked with rage , " I'll --  " The Chief intervened swiftly . " Here , none of that , " he said sharply to Miro . " Do n't say anything you 'll regret later . " Then he turned to Grant , who was steadily holding his ground : " There was no reason , Pemberton , to insult an inspector of the Service . Consider yourself reprimanded . " But the edge of the rebuke was taken off by the slight twinkle in the Chief 's eye . Somehow a truce was patched up . Grant was to ship as an ordinary passenger on the Althea , the great passenger liner that plied between Callisto and the Earth . It was not his duty to prevent the disappearance of the vessel , the Chief insisted , but to endeavor to discover the cause . It was up to Grant then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miro on Ganymede immediately with his findings . Miro was leaving by his private Service flier at once for Ganymede , to await him . Grant thought he saw a faint sardonic gleam in the Inspector 's eyes at that , but paid no particular heed to it at the time . * * * * * Now , as Grant stood in the corridor of the great space-flier , listening intently for further sounds from his hidden foe , it flashed on him . Miro knew he was on board . It was a Ganymedan who had treacherously attacked him . The puzzle was slowly fitting its pieces together . But the major piece still eluded him . What would happen to the ship ? As he turned to go back to his room , a ripping , tearing , grinding sound came to his startled ears . It was followed by a sudden swishing noise . Grant knew what that meant . A meteor had ripped into the vitals of the space-flier , and the precious air was rushing through the fissure into outer space . He whirled without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the captain 's quarters . If caught in time , the hole could be plugged . Even as he ran , there was another grinding smash , then another , and another . Good Lord , they must have headed right into a meteor shower . Panels were sliding open , and people , scantily attired , thrust startled heads out into the corridor . Someone called after him , but he did not heed or stop his headlong race . He must get to the control room at once . Already the air in the corridor was a sucking whirlpool that beat and eddied about him in its mad rush to escape . It sounded like the drumbeat of unsilenced exploders . A meteor shower of unprecedented proportions ! In the back of Grant 's mind as he ran , hammered a thought . Every swarm of meteors in the solar system was carefully plotted . The lanes of travel were routed to avoid them . There was no known shower in this particular area ! He collided violently with a strange ungainly figure . In his desperate haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push his way past . The figure turned on him , and then Grant stopped short , an exclamation frozen to his lips . Red unwinking eyes stared out at him from goggles set in a helmet . The body was completely inclosed in lusterless creatoid . It was a Ganymedan in a space-suit ! * * * * * Grant saw the quick movement of the other toward an open side flap . He did not hesitate an instant . His fist shot out and caught the Ganymedan flush in the throat , while his left hand simultaneously seized the creatoid-covered arm that gripped a pencil-ray . The helmeted head went back with a sickening thud . But the Ganymedan was a powerful brute . Even as he staggered back from the force of the blow , vainly trying to release the pencil-ray for action , his right foot jerked forward . The next moment both were rolling on the floor , twisting and heaving in silent combat . Frightened passengers rushed down the corridor , screaming with terror , half carried along by the hurricane wind , clambering over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , they knew not ; and still neither relaxed his grip , seeking a mortal hold . Pemberton was certain that his silent unknown foe held the clue to the mystery he was trying to fathom . He fought on , silently , grimly . The cold creatoid fabric was slippery , but a sudden jerk of an arm , a certain quick twist that Grant was familiar with , and his enemy went limp . Grant 's breath was coming in quick , labored gasps . There was very little air left now . But he did not care . He tugged at the fastenings on the helmet . He must see who his captive was , wrest from him the heart of the mystery . There came a clatter of feet behind him , a sudden rush of space-suited figures that overwhelmed and passed over him with trampling strides . He was torn loose from his prey , rolled over and over , gasping for air . When he staggered to his feet again , bruised and shaken , the corridor was swept clean of figures . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild surge of anger swept through him . More Ganymedans , these rescuers , all accoutered for airless space . They had been carefully prepared for this . Heedless of all else , he swayed groggily after them , intent only on joining battle once again . The illumination was dim now , the cries of fear that had rung through the ship were gone ; only a deathly silence reigned now . His lungs were burning for want of air ; even the whirlwind had died down for lack of fuel . But still he kept on , like a bloodhound on the trail . * * * * * He rounded a corner . A slight figure , swaying like a reed , collided with him and would have fallen if he had not thrust out a supporting arm . It was a girl . Even in the shadowy light he saw that she was beautiful . Her delicately molded features were drained white , but her deep pooled eyes were level in their gaze , unafraid . " I 'm sorry , " he managed , finding utterance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " she said , with a wan smile , " if only I had some air to breathe . " The essential bravery of her touched him . He forgot all about the escaped Ganymedans . " We 'll have to try some other portion of the ship . Maybe some of the bulkheads are uninjured . " She shook her head . " I just saw the captain , " she enunciated faintly . " Every bulkhead is riddled . Said -- I -- should get space-suit -- in stateroom -- though no use -- doomed . Something wrong -- wireless -- not working .... " Her voice trailed . She had fainted . Grant caught up her slight form and lurched unsteadily into the nearest cabin . The blood was roaring in his ears now , his heart was pumping madly , but he forced himself on . His eyes strained toward the compartment where the emergency space-suit was neatly compacted . Thank God . It was still there . The inmate had evidently rushed out at the first alarm to join the terror-maddened crush . Pemberton worked with feverish haste . Somehow he thrust the unconscious girl into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve that started the steady measured flow of life-giving oxygen . Then , with dark spots dancing before his eyes , he deposited her gently on the floor , and managed to force himself in the now almost total darkness toward another room . * * * * * His swelling hands fumbled . The compartment was empty . Despairing , conscious only of a desire to lie down , to rest , he tried another . It , too , was empty . He stumbled over sprawled bodies , fell , managed to get up again . Again he fumbled into a compartment . The clammy feel of the creatoid never was more welcome . His breath was coming in whistling gasps . It seemed ages of strangulation before the first cool rush of oxygen expanded his tortured lungs . For a full minute he stood there , inhaling deep draughts . Then once more he was himself , his brain functioning with keen clarity . He must find the Ganymedans and come to grips with them . There was no doubt in his mind that somehow they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know , but he would find out . But the girl . He could not leave her . Duty and something else stirred into conflict . He hesitated . In the flap of the suit was an emergency flash . Throwing the beam on the walls and flooring , he managed to retrace his steps to the cabin where he had left her . As he flashed it inside , his heart gave a great bound . She was standing now . " Feel all right ? " he spoke into the tiny transmitter that was part of the regulation equipment . " Fine . " Her warm , rich voice spoke in his ear . " But I 'm not thinking of myself . Are the others on board safe ? What happened ? " " I 'm afraid we are the only ones alive , " he told her gravely . " As to what happened , I can only guess . We seem to have hit an unusually heavy meteor shower that riddled us through and through , though --  " He paused . " Though what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got to do is find out where we are . " His flash sought the window switch and found it . He went over and pressed it . A section of the beryllium-steel casing slid smoothly open , disclosing a thick flawless quartzite port . He stared out at the dark pattern of space . Long he gazed , then a stifled exclamation reached the girl . " What is it ? " she cried . " Come and look , " he told her gravely , and made room for her . * * * * * At first she saw only the unwinking stars of space . Then her eyes shifted forward . Jupiter lay ahead , a vast cloud-girt disk . It was ominously near . Somehow it gave the effect of rushing straight at her . Right along the equator floated , or seemed to float , a huge red oval -- the Great Red Spot of Jupiter . She had heard of it before . But what caught her immediate attention was a tiny flare of intense illumination , right in the very heart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dazzling even at this distance . She watched it eagerly . Then she gave a sudden start . " You 've seen it . " Grant 's voice sounded quietly in her helmet . " Yes . Why , it -- it pulsates ! " " Exactly . Now look along the hull of the ship . " She did so , and gasped again . The steel-shod sides were bathed in an unearthly orange glow . " Why , that must be the light from the orange spot down there . " Grant nodded . " Yes , and more than that . They are power waves of a nature that we 've known nothing of before . We are being pulled down along that beam straight for Jupiter , straight for the source of that light ! " " But that means there are intelligent beings on Jupiter . " " No doubt . " " But -- but everyone know that there 's no life on Jupiter . It 's a frozen waste swathed in impenetrable whirlwind clouds . " " How does everyone know ? " Grant retorted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " she admitted ; " though there have been plenty of expeditions that tried , and never came back . " " That of course does n't prove anything . Mind you , " he added . " I did n't say there was native life existing on Jupiter . I merely said there were intelligent beings operating that illumination . " " Who could it be then ? " " We 'll find out when we get down there . " * * * * * The very calmness of his matter-of-fact statement brought her back abruptly to their precarious situation . " But , great heavens , we 'll smash and be killed . Ca n't we do something ? " " We 'll not smash . " Grant said positively . " Though very likely we shall be killed . As for doing something , we can only wait and take our chances , if the gentry who are hauling us in will only give us an opportunity . You know , " he added with a fine inconsecutiveness , " I do n't even know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nona -- Nona Gail . I was on my way to Callisto , to meet my father , " she explained . " He 's an engineer , doing some construction work for Interspace Products . But now that I 've told you all , what and who may you be ? " He was frank . There was now no need for concealment . " Grant Pemberton , an unimportant unit of the Interplanetary Secret Service . " " Then you knew that the trip would be dangerous , " she challenged . " Yes . " " Why did you come ? " " It is part of my duties . " There was silence between them . He turned to stare out of the quartz port-hole again . Jupiter was perceptibly nearer ; an enormous , convex globe that blotted out half the heavens . They were being drawn at a frightful velocity toward the mysterious pulsating point , now blinding in its brilliance . They both saw it simultaneously : a space-suited figure , far out in the depths of interstellar space , caught up in a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirl around , straighten up , and shoot at breakneck speed headlong for Jupiter . Behind it , and in a direct line with the winking flame in the Great Spot , another space denizen glowed luridly , startlingly , out of the blackness beyond , whirled , and shot down the long invisible path . Nona cried out : " Grant , tell me quickly , what are they ; what is pulling them ? " Even as she spoke , more and more figures were blazoned in that orange ray , until a long file of beings were catapulting in a single straight line past the space-ship , outdistancing it until they became faint specks in the distance . * * * * * Pemberton 's hand was upon her shoulder , his eyes literally blazing through the goggles , while his voice shouted in her ears . " Come with me : We have n't a second to lose . " " But , " she gasped , " you have n't told me --  " " No time , " he interrupted , and , shoving her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor until they came to the air-lock of the liner . " If only we have time , " he groaned , and cursed himself for a bungling fool for not having surmised the maneuver earlier . Just as he had expected , the great lock was open . The ship was as silent as the grave . There was no air anywhere , only the unutterably cold airlessness of space . Without pausing in his headlong rush , he pushed the bewildered girl through the open port , out into the overwhelming , intangible blackness . Nona 's smothered cry of fear came to him as the next instant he stepped forward and left the solid footing to float in sudden weightlessness in a vast sea of nothingness . The girl reached out and caught his arm convulsively . Even through the fabric of their suits he could feel her trembling . Pemberton had taken good care to retain a hold on the edge of the open air-lock . The two swung unsteadily . " What is the reason for this ? " Grant sensed , rather , than heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desperate effort to control herself . " We 'll be lost -- out here in space . " " Do n't worry , " he said soothingly . " I 'll explain in due course . In the meantime you 'll have to trust me . Did you see where that invisible ray held when it illumined the last Ganymedan ? " " Ganymedan ? " she echoed in surprise . " What makes you think --  " " Never mind that . Did you ? " he insisted . " Yes , " she admitted , " it was about over there . " She indicated the spot with an outthrust arm . " About a hundred yards , I should judge . " " Exactly , " he agreed . " Well , young lady , our lives , and far more , depend upon our reaching that exact line in space immediately . " " I do n't know what you are talking about , but even so , how can we make it ? I 'm not a rocket . " " It 's difficult , I admit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , and press your feet firmly against the wall of the ship . " She obeyed . " Now when I count three , shove off violently , and pray that we 're going straight . Are you game ? " She stiffened ; then , very slowly , " All right ; start counting . " " Good girl , " Grant said approvingly . " One -- two -- th-r-ee-ee ! " They flexed their legs in perfect unison . And shoved off . * * * * * Out into the blackness of space they shot , lost to all sense of motion : yet the hull of the space-flier , dimly gleaming in the thin light of the far off sun , retreated from them with terrifying swiftness . They were alone in space ! It was an uncanny , a horribly helpless sensation . All about them was infinity , a vast void out of which peered at them the cold , unwinking stars . They were like swimmers in mid-ocean , without even the buoyant feel of the salt water to comfort them . Nona 's grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scared ? " Grant queried . " A -- a little , " she admitted ; " but do n't bother about me . I 'm all right . " She could be depended upon to keep up her end , Grant thought admiringly . On and on they floated in the welter of space . And still there was no ray , nothing but unrelieved blackness . Pemberton was somewhat worried . Had the saving ray been quenched at the source ? Were they too late ? If so , they were doomed to a frightful obliterating fall to the surface of the planet , or worse still , they were destined to swing endlessly in space . Already the liner was far away , out of their grasp , even had they desired to return . His breath was coming in quick gasps now . " Scared ? " he once more asked the silent figure beside him . " Frightfully -- but carry on . We 'll get there , wherever it is . " Her gay determination strengthened him wonderfully . On and on they floated . Suddenly the dim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next instant the creatoid fabric of his own suit caught it , too . " Thank God , " he cried joyously . " It 's still on . Just relax , Nona , the ray will take care of us now . " He felt a powerful tug at his body , he was whirled completely around , and then there was a steady pull . He was being catapulted down the ray to the mysterious point of brilliance in the Great Red Spot . The girl was right beside him . The space-liner was passed with a smooth rush , and soon receded to a dwindling speck . * * * * * " Now will you explain ? " asked Nona impatiently , after she had caught her breath in sudden relief . Grant stretched luxuriously before he began . " Certainly . There 's nothing for us now to do but wait until we get pulled down to Jupiter , and that 'll take some time . I hope we look like Ganymedans . " " Will you get on with your story ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning and went right up to the time when he had so rudely thrust her out into space . " You see , " he explained . " I had put the puzzle together a bit , but there were still pieces missing . For instance , those chaps down there know that every space-liner is equipped with emergency space-suits . Why pull the ship down with live men on board ? That would naturally mean a fight , and we have no mean weapons , what with disintegrator ray-projectors and explosive electro-bullets . " Then , again , for some reason , there were Ganymedans on board . They would very likely be whiffed out in the melee . The ship might be destroyed also , and they evidently are very careful about getting the ship down intact . The little meteor holes can easily be plugged up , and the liner made as good as new . At least that was my guess . " I was trying to puzzle it out , rather hopelessly , " he continued , " when I saw the ray out in space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little piece in the jigsaw . " The Ganymedans evidently had to leave the ship because , as it approaches the planet , something will be done to kill off any unfortunates who are still alive , waiting their chance to fight the invisible enemy . Possibly a penetrating lethal gas that will be forced into the interior . So they evolved the ray to carry the Ganymedan passengers down gently , safely . And we are stowaways , " he concluded grimly . Nona had listened intently to the long recital . " But why , " she expostulated , " was it necessary to have their own people on board ? The meteors that riddled the ship were projectiles shot from their station on Jupiter . So was the attraction-ray that pulls the ship down . " " Because they required a sufficient force to disable the radio apparatus . All radio waves used on interplanetary liners are shielded from interference . It is impossible to blank them out . And with the radio intact , every battle flier in space would be on their trail in a hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still they fell endlessly through space , unaware of their motion except that Jupiter was now a huge orb blotting out the universe . The grim face of the giant planet was enswathed in endless billowing clouds . No one had ever penetrated to the real core . But what held their eager , straining attention was a vast blood red disk , cyclonic in character , directly beneath them . The Great Red Spot ! And immediately in the center of it was the tiny , blindingly brilliant yellow orange oval , winking up at them with quick , steady pulsations . " What can it be ? " Nona wondered . " The source of their power , evidently . But what interests me more just now is where the Ganymedans have their hangout in those clouds , and what they 're doing with the ships they capture . " Jupiter was now a flat level stretch that reached on all sides as far as the eye could see . Grant felt a sudden sensation of weight again , as though something was pressing with crushing force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " our fall is being checked . They 're making sure their friends come to no harm . " And he laughed bitterly , thinking of the men and women lying with lungs ruptured , cold and stiff , in the interior of the Althea ; of the possible few wretches who had managed to huddle into space-suits , ignorant of the deadly gas that was soon to search out their seemingly impenetrable habiliments . Slowly , ever more slowly , they fell . Thin wisps of reddish vapor rushed upward toward them , and then they were enveloped in vast swirls of cloud masses . They were within the Great Spot ! Then the lurid clouds parted suddenly , revealing a deep hole , at the bottom of which flamed and flared the mysterious yellow-orange brilliance . Down the long shaft they fell , while all around its invisible walls dark red cyclones stirred and beat in vain . * * * * * Just as it seemed as if they were doomed to fall headlong into the blaze , they were swerved violently into an opening that angled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they continued to fall -- interminably -- when suddenly it widened , and they were dropping through the interior of a great dome of which the arched roof was the swirling clouds they had just penetrated . Directly beneath floated a flat island of smooth rock , supported and upheld by a shining sea of vapors . The girl exclaimed sharply , but Grant only nodded to himself with grim satisfaction . He had expected something like this . For , clustered in serried rows at the end of the island directly beneath them were sleek , stream-lined grayhounds of the interplanetary traffic lanes , now resting immovably on the smooth gray stone -- the missing space-liners ! The island was bisected by a huge forbidding wall , over which , at their angle , Grant was unable to see . The ground was encumbered too with clumps of intricate machinery , all of the same polished gray stone ; Ganymedan stone , Ganymedan machinery , Pemberton recognized at once . Hundreds of figures were scurrying awkwardly around , clad in the inevitable space-suit . Several were working desperately at a huge concave glass reflector . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit , directly upward . " I 'm afraid . " Nona shuddered and pressed closer to Grant . " Do n't be , " he assured her . " Just say nothing when we land . Let me do the talking . " All this while they had been floating gently downward toward what they now saw to be a miniature replica of the vaster orange brightness at the bottom of the main shaft from which they had been diverted . It was a pool of liquid fire , so intense in its brilliance that their eyes were dazzled staring at it . It rose and fell in regular pulsations . They were not far above it now , and still no one on the strange island seemed to be aware of their coming . Nona cried out , " Grant , we 're going to fall right into it ! " Pemberton looked down at the small fiery pool with anxious eyes . Unless something happened , and that quickly , they would be seared to a crisp . Already the heat was uncomfortable , even through their suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull of the liquid was too powerful for him . Then he resolved on a desperate expedient . " Say , you fellows down there , " he cried in the smooth , slurred Ganymedan speech . " What are you trying to do , fry us ? Hurry up and prepare our landing . " * * * * * For a moment they were tense with the tenseness of imminent death . Were the Ganymedans equipped with communication disks ; would they sense the strangeness of the accent ? Nona was gripping his hand with a pressure that penetrated the fabric . And every second brought them down closer and closer to the dread lake . " Ah ! " Nona 's breath came in a shuddering sigh . For one of the figures glanced upward and saw them dropping . He shouted something to his fellows , and darted for a lever set in the stone next to the pool . He threw it over swiftly . Immediately what seemed to be a smooth slab of transparent glassite shot into position over the pulsating flame , not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the flaming death when the Earthlings ' feet were already touching it . " It would have served you two fools right if I had let you drop in , " their savior grumbled disgustedly . " What in Jupiter took you so long ? Everyone else arrived hours ago . Did n't know there were any more . " " Sorry , but we could n't help it , " Grant responded carefully . " You see , we got mixed up in a scrap with some Earthmen who evidently suspected us , just as we were diving out of the air-lock . We had the devil 's own job of beating them off . " " You too ! The Chief came down foaming at the mouth . Some dumb Earthman almost throttled him before he got away . He swears he 'll blast Earth out of space . He 's that mad . But here , I 've got no time to be talking to your fellows . I 've got work to do . Better report to the Chief at once , and heaven help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . " With that he moved away , over to the gang of Ganymedans holding the stone nozzle and looking expectantly up at the large , round hole in the cloud ceiling . Nona stood close to Grant . " What are they doing with the queer affair ? " She indicated the nozzle . " I 'm afraid we 'll find out only too soon , " he answered grimly . " Look --  " he broke off . Far overhead , through the great round orifice , darted a tremendous shape , pointed , glittering . " Why , that 's the Althea , " Nona exclaimed . " Yes . Now watch . Damn -- all we can do is watch , " Grant gritted between his teeth . * * * * * Down sped the gleaming liner , pride of the fleet . The men at the mirror were swerving it on gimbals until a ray from it flashed on the burnished nose . As though it were a physical impact , the vessel slackened its tremendous speed and hung suspended midway between the cloud concavity and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A thin stream of fluid shot out of the orifice straight up for the captive liner . The tip of the expanding spray impinged on the hull -- and Nona gasped her astonishment . For the liquid passed clean through the hull as though it were a porous network instead of four-inch thick beryllium-steel . " Just as I thought , " Grant groaned . " Lethal gas that penetrates everything . Those poor people on board -- for their own sakes I hope none remained alive to hit this . " " Ca n't we do anything ? " Nona asked desperately . " Nothing for the Althea . But plenty to prevent any more disasters like it . " There was a hard ring to his voice . " Come on . " He stepped off the transparent slab onto the stone floor of the island . " Where to ? " asked Nona , following . " We 're going to locate that orange oval we saw from the Althea . That 's the secret of all this . The pool of liquid fire here is unimportant , secondary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other side was hidden from them by the solid wall that stretched across its full diameter . " We 'll scout beyond there , " Grant pointed out . " I 'll miss my guess if what we 're looking for is not on the other side . " As they started for the wall , they saw the Althea brought slowly down to the rock , another captive to swell the motionless fleet . It did not take them long to reach the barrier . Some fifty feet high it was , of smooth polished Ganymedan stone , and no door or opening in its straight unbroken surface . " How shall we get through ? " Nona asked . Grant surveyed it thoughtfully . " There must be a hidden spring somewhere , " he said . He walked carelessly along the wall , tapping it idly here and there . His quick probing fingers were searching . With a sharp " Ah ! " he stopped short . He bent over a moment ; his fingers moved deftly . Then he straightened with a grunt of satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sliding silently open . He looked through . * * * * * Nona saw him jerk his head back , heard his involuntary cry of horror . Then she heard another cry : an excited warning shout . She whirled around in time to see a Ganymedan running toward them from behind . A deadly pencil-ray pointed straight at her companion . Without a moment 's hesitation she sprang at Grant , pushed him violently so that he staggered and fell through the opening to the other side . In so doing , she tripped over his body , and fell prone . That saved her life , for a blue flame sheared clean through the stone , inches above her head . Grant squirmed around underneath . The electro-gun was somehow out of the side flap and now it spat its explosive hail . The tiny bullets flared into little puff balls of flame against the space-suit of the Ganymedan . A long howl of anguish came to them as he threw up his hands and fell into a shapeless heap . But a moment later there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet again with the quickness of a cat . He pulled Nona up after him , thrust her to one side , behind the protection of the wall . His eyes were blazing now , aflame with the ardor of battle . Very carefully he leaned out and pressed the trigger . The surging mob was caught in full flight . The electro-bullets spread fanwise , exploded into flaming deaths . The Ganymedans went down as though a huge scythe had swept through their ranks . The survivors scattered hastily , throwing themselves headlong to the surface of the rock to escape further execution . " That 'll hold them for a while , " Grant laughed grimly . " Drop your gun , and turn around -- both of you . " A cold , smooth voice spoke in deadly menace directly behind them -- a voice that came from the mysterious inner side of the wall . Grant spun around , his gun ready to fire . A ray snapped out at him , a ray with a greenish tinge . The fingers of his gun hand grew suddenly nerveless ; the weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towered before him , unhidden by a space-suit . Evidently there was a layer of air in here . The red lidless eyes were filled with a cold fury . Spatulate fingers tensed on the button of a pencil ray . " Miro , " Grant breathed to himself unbelievingly . A great light burst upon him . * * * * * The Inspector of the Service for Ganymede did not recognize him , swathed as Grant was in the depths of his space-suit , nor did he notice the little movement of surprise . He was too furiously angry . His words came tumbling out in a tremble of rage . " You damned scoundrels ; have you gone mad ? What do you mean by coming in here through the secret way ? Do n't you know it is death for anyone to pass the barrier ? And what do you mean by shooting down your fellows with an Earth weapon ? Answer , damn you , before I thrust you into the Gorm . " Both were silent ; Nona because she did not know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be recognized by Miro 's keen ears . He kept his eyes fixed on the Ganymedan , waiting hawk-like for one false move , for the tiniest wavering of attention . But the pencil-ray was pointed squarely at his breast . " You wo n't talk ? " Miro 's voice was choked with passion . " Well , there are ways to make you . " With one foot he kicked at the open slab , while his weapon commanded them unwaveringly . There was a smooth soundless rush . Grant knew that the wall was an unbroken surface again . They were cut off on the secret side of the island , alone with Miro . Yet that was the horror of it . They were not alone . For Grant 's first darting look inside when he had first opened the panel had shown him the others . Hundreds of them there were , men of all races and planets , a motley crew . And each man walked stiffly , unnaturally , looking neither to the right nor to the left . Their eyes were fixed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what their origin , was uniformly parched and gray . A cold sweat broke out on Grant 's forehead . They looked like automatons : beings from whom life had been drained . He heard a little choked cry from Nona ; she had seen them , too . Miro plucked out with his free hand a little pear-shaped mechanism punctured with innumerable holes . He blew into it , once -- twice . It gave forth a high whining note . Instantly two of the strange lifeless men wheeled angularly , and with queer mechanical movements headed straight for them . A bloodless hand stretched out , grasped Nona . Grant heard her scream and saw her struggling in a loathsome grip . * * * * * Forgetting everything , forgetting the deadly ray in Miro 's hands , he sprang to her rescue . The next instant he was in the grip of a similar hand , a frail , dead-white naked arm , yet endowed with the strength of steel . Struggle as he might , dash his fist as hard as he could against the unresisting blank face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his futile strugglings mockingly . " Take these traitors over to the Gorm and let me look at their faces , " he ordered . Grant and Nona were picked up in those emaciated , powerful arms as easily as though they were children , and the unhuman creatures proceeded at a slow , awkward pace away from the hall , toward the outer edge of the island . From his uncomfortable vantage point , Pemberton noticed that they were passing clumps of intricate stone machinery . Dead-faced automatons , similar to their captors , were tending the whirring machinery with ordered , stiff-legged movements . Then , straight ahead , Grant saw the edge of the island , against which beat and billowed in furious , gigantic heaves , the reddish overarching clouds of the Great Spot . Strangely enough , though they whirled and eddied , they could not seem to break through the invisible barrier . And then the lake of fire sprang into view -- the mysterious place of flame they had seen from afar , that had pulled the hapless Althea out of its course down to destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide circular pool it was , of an unearthly yellow-orange brilliance . The midday sun was no more dazzling to the eye . Out it stretched from the island into the vapors of the Great Red Spot , only touching the stone rim of the island at one thin point . Its liquid fires were waveless now , oily , yet there was something horrible , too , about its smooth quiescence . Miro whistled . The rigid guards dropped their burdens roughly and stood at attention . One was an Earthman , the other a fish-faced Venusian . Yet the queer dead look of their eyes was exactly the same . " Will you remove your helmets , or shall I ask the Doora to assist you ? " Miro 's voice was silky . * * * * * Because there was nothing else to do , Grant unscrewed his helmet and let it fall back on its hinge . Then he looked very calmly and steadily at the Inspector of the Service for Ganymede . A dull flame leaped into Miro 's eyes at the sight of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiarly horrible smile . " You are cleverer than I thought , my Earth friend . You should have been strangled to death on the Althea , or made into one of --  " He stopped short , and the smile widened cruelly . " But it is not too late . No , it is not too late . " Grant disregarded his cryptic phrases . He smiled , too , a contemptuous smile that cut like a lash . " You , Miro , an Inspector of the Service , are only a lying , treacherous , butchering Ganymedan . Filthy scum of the Universe . " Miro started forward with a roar , a dark flush of rage suffusing his green-tinged countenance . His blunt-edged finger trembled on the button of the pencil-ray . Grant knew he was perilously on the verge of sudden death , yet his scornful glance did not waver . It was Nona , hitherto unnoticed , her helmet removed , who darted upon the giant Ganymedan with small beating fists . Miro saw her coming and swung her sprawling away with one sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . He had recovered his composure . Some secret merriment seemed to convulse him . " Ho ! ho ! " he shouted . " Who is this little spitfire ? By Jupiter , she is a tempting morsel . " And his red eyes took in the flushed beauty of the panting girl speculatively . Grant tensed for a quick spring . " Stand where you are , " Miro barked . " One move and it will be your last . " Gone was the smooth unctuous speech of former times . His tone now was cutting , deadly . * * * * * " You damned Earthmen have been crowing long enough , " he said . " When Miro and Ganymede get through with you , the very memory of your filthy planet will have been erased from the solar system . " His voice rose higher . " You thought you had us beaten down with your space-battleships and your embargoes on metals . And we were meekly repentant . Oh yes , we were ! We took you in nicely . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your rotten Service . " But we have been preparing against the day for years . Here on this island that we built we worked , hidden from interference . We are ready now . Our fleets will sail out , in your own ships , to smash the combined space navies of the solar system . " In spite of himself Grant could not hide a sudden grin of relief . The man was mad , to think of pitting a few liners against armored battle craft . Miro saw that grin . " You think I 'm mad , do n't you ? " he gloated . " Just listen to this , then . We have found a substance that no ray , no electro-bullet can penetrate . Every ship will be coated with it . And the Gorm here "  - -  he pointed to the oily lake --  " will draw your proud cruisers down to destruction , or thrust them far out into the uncharted spaces , helpless , just as it pleases us . You wonder how it works ? Look ! Now it attracts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it like this "  - -  he leaned over and pulled a switch set in the rock right by the edge --  " it repels everything . We 'll just stand off in space and pick off your proud warships one by one , without a scratch to ourselves . See ? " He fairly hissed the last word . Grant saw , and the cold sweat burst out on his forehead . His brain raced desperately in a vain effort to find some way out , some method of foiling this beast . " You sure talk big , Miro , " he said in bored fashion , feigning indifference ; " but it means nothing to me . The point is , what do you intend doing with us ? " * * * * * The Ganymedan 's lips writhed . " Nothing at all to your pretty friend , " he leered . " I have plans for her . But as for you -- see these creatures all about ? " " Well ? " " You are going to be one of them . They are passengers and crews who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sprayed with our gas . It does not kill . Oh , no ! It just numbs their faculties , paralyzes them . Then our surgeons get busy . They know how to remove the memory and reasoning areas of the brain and leave just machines , automata , to do our bidding . Clever , are n't they ? When Earth is captured , I intend subjecting all your damned breed to the operation . They make very willing slaves , I 've found . Two blasts on this toy "  - -  he raised the whistle to his lips --  " and an Earth-Doora comes for you . " Nona sprang forward . " No , no , Miro . Please do not touch Mr. Pemberton . I'll -- I'll --  " " What will you ? " The Ganymedan 's pig-eyes devoured her . " I'll --  " Then , to Grant 's eternal horror , she sank into Miro 's arms . The surprised look on Miro 's face changed slowly to one of passion , as he held her close to him with his great hairy arm . " Nona ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon at his breast , he sprang . Miro snarled as he saw him coming . His finger pressed down . But at that instant the Earth girl struck out with all the power of her slender arm . It was not much of a blow , but it managed to jar the weapon aside . The blue flame leaped hissing through the air . Miro roared with rage , and flung her yards away , to lie , an unmoving pathetic bundle . Then he swung his ray back into play . But he never had a chance to use it . All the strength and fury of Grant 's lithe , steel sinews and bone were behind the solid smash that landed squarely on the Ganymedan 's chin . He went down in a slump , completely out . * * * * * Grant stooped to pick up the fallen pencil-ray , thrust it in the side flap , then hurried over to the limp figure of Nona . " Darling , " he cried , " if anything 's happened to you , I'll --  " The still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was smiling weakly , but happily . Grant flushed . " As many times later as you 'll want , " he said , " but now that you 're not hurt , we ca n't waste any time in trying to get out of here . " He walked over to Miro , who was just coming to . " Listen , you rat , " he told the Ganymedan , who was rubbing his chin and groaning : " you do exactly as I say , if you know what 's good for you . " He shook the pencil-ray significantly . " You ca n't get away with it , " Miro snarled , muttering a string of curses . There was baffled rage in his red pig-eyes . Grant surveyed him coldly . " We 'll see about that , " he snapped . " Get up . " He reinforced his demand with a well-placed kick . The huge Ganymedan came quickly to his feet . " Walk to the wall , " was the next order , " and open the trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miro obeyed . Grant followed him with his pistol in readiness . The poor mindless creatures paid no heed to what was going on , but dully continued their appointed tasks . Pemberton hid himself behind the wall to one side . Nona did likewise , having picked up the electro-gun meanwhile . Only Miro stood before the opening . " Now tell your cutthroat friends out there we want one of the liners brought directly over the Gorm , you understand . Not the Althea , though -- that 's still full of holes . And only one Ganymedan to guide her over the wall . Be very explicit , and not a false move out of you , or it 'll be your last . " With the knowledge that two deadly weapons were pointing squarely at him , Miro shouted unwillingly the necessary instructions to his subordinates outside . Then Grant leaned over and kicked the slide shut . * * * * * There followed tense moments of waiting . Would the workers beyond obey their leader ? Had they become suspicious , and were even now massing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then to his ears came the most welcome soft roar of muted rockets . A huge shape swept over the high wall , soared directly over the Gorm , and nestled down in little jets of flame until the stern rested on the solid rock , and the bow swung idly over the brilliant pool . " Keep your gun trained on this bird , " Grant told Nona swiftly . She nodded . The air-lock door on the ship was already sliding open . A Ganymedan , space-suited , was coming through . He saw them , tried to spring back into the shelter of the ship . But a blue ray stabbed out and caught him in mid-flight . There was a spatter of dust , and the hapless creature disintegrated into thin air . " Sorry I had to do it , but I could n't afford to let him give the alarm . Now for the dirty work , Nona . You hustle this big bully into the ship , and keep him covered . I 'll be right along . " The girl cast him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? " " Do n't worry , " he assured her ; " I wo n't get hurt . " After he had seen them within the liner , he got to work . First he brought out from the ship coils of wiring and jumbles of instruments . He took them over to the edge of the Gorm , to the place where he had seen Miro pull the switch , and for the next ten minutes was busy connecting wires , attaching batteries , putting his instruments in place . Then , when he was satisfied that everything was ready , he reversed the switch . The great space-ship , some fifty feet away , was already trembling in every line . Just as he was rising to sprint for the slowly moving liner , he heard a smooth rushing noise . He whirled . The slide was opening in the wall . A mob of Ganymedans were pouring through . They paused uncertainly a moment , then , as they spied him , there was a concerted rush forward . Grant acted quickly . Already the space-ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an instant to spare . He dove toward it . The mob yelled , and raced forward to cut him off . His pencil-ray was useless -- the distance was too great for its limited range . But then , that applied equally to the weapons of the Ganymedans. * * * * * The blue rays snapped forward at him angrily , but fell short . The ship was moving faster now . It was already several feet off the ground . Grant 's heavy space-suit impeded his progress . The charging Ganymedans were dangerously close now . That last beam had missed him by inches . The ship was gathering speed . He was five feet away from the open air-lock when they got the range . A sharp searing pain right across his shoulder . The creatoid material of his suit was cut away as with a knife . A layer of flesh lay exposed . The skin had been whiffed into nothingness . But that very instant he was leaping off the ground with a mighty effort . The ship was going upward with a rush now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For one breathless instant he clung ; then , to his horror , the smooth creatoid covering refused to hold . Slowly he slipped , in spite of every effort , as the surface of the hull refused purchase to his bleeding hands , then down he went with a thud . A cry of triumph arose from the onrushing Ganymedans as Grant scrambled to his feet , bruised and shaken . He cast a swift , despairing glance upward . The huge liner was a hundred feet up now , gathering speed swiftly . To one side was the Gorm , a place of dread and menace . The gloating enemy were almost upon him . Even the comfort of a weapon , the grim satisfaction of taking some of his foes to death with him , was denied him . The pencil-ray had been jarred out of his hand by the impact and had doubtless fallen into the Gorm . Grant felt that he had come to the end of the rope . There was no tremor of fear in him , only regret that he had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she do , out in space , alone with Miro ? No time to think of that now , though . The foremost of the Ganymedans were almost upon him . They intended taking him alive , did they ? He braced himself for the attack , ready to go down fighting . * * * * * Then a brilliant plan beat suddenly upon his dazzled mind . It was breath-taking , so simple , yet so desperate did it appear . If it worked -- he would win through . If not -- but Grant dismissed that thought quickly ; one form of death was no worse than another . Without an instant 's hesitation , he whirled and jumped as high as he could -- directly over the Gorm ! There was a yell of astonishment from the Ganymedans -- one had already clutched at his intended victim -- as they fell back in horror from the edge . This Earthling was mad to brave the terrors of the Gorm ! But Grant heard nothing . He was instantly conscious of a searing , racking pain that penetrated his every fiber . He forced his eyes upward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was he destined to drop into the fiery lake . For a single interminable instant , he suffered untold agonies . Then his body quivered , and he felt an unmistakable push against him . He was moving upward , just as he had hoped . The Gorm was repelling him , even as it had the ship . Faster and faster he shot up , chasing the liner . Would he catch up with it ? He strained his eyes . Exultation flooded through him as he realized that the distance was rapidly lessening between them . The added impetus of his leap over the Gorm had given him the required extra fillip of speed . By now , rays were streaking by him . Soon he was directly underneath . For an instant he had a quick fear that he might overshoot his mark . But no -- he was sliding past the open air-lock . He threw himself sideways and caught at it . This time his fingers held . As he squirmed and wriggled into the lock , they were already careening into the orange tube through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Choking , he managed with numbed fingers to screw his helmet on . Then , closing the lock , he proceeded into the ship . Nona was guarding her prisoner vigilantly . Miro sat there , sullen , defiant . Her glad , welcoming cry filled Grant with a new strange warmth . " I was so afraid for you when the ship started and you did n't show up , " she said , " but I did n't dare leave him alone . " She indicated Miro . " Good girl , " he said admiringly . " We 'll bind him now and then I want to show you something . " * * * * * They stood a little later at the bow quartz port-hole . Down the long shaft through which they had risen they saw the glaring flame of the Gorm . As they looked , its regular pulsations turned irregular : it leaped and splashed as though it was a stormy , choppy sea . Then it gave one final mighty heave , and the universe seemed to shatter beneath them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were enswathed in a raging storm of red clouds . Nona turned to Grant . " Now , will you explain ? " " Certainly , " he grinned boyishly . " I simply reversed the switch that changes the current of the Gorm . I knew that it would then repel the liner out into space , as Miro was incautious enough to inform me . " Then I figured that if instead of direct current , an alternating flow could be induced , so as to attract and repel in quick succession , enough of a disturbance would be raised in that highly unstable mixture to start fireworks . So I rigged up an automatic break in the circuit , timed it to permit us to get up enough speed from the repulsion to be safely on our way before it would start . The circuit-breaker worked and the alternating current did the rest . That island is wiped out , and so is the Gorm . There 'll be no further threat of danger to the solar system from that . " " And Miro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Turn him over to the Service . They 'll take care of him . And now , young lady , if you have no further questions , shall I say it again ? " She smiled up at him tenderly , answering : " If you wish . " * * * * *
