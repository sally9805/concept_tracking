txt Declared to have proved its worth in five factories here , a plan for guaranteeing jobs or income to workers is recommcnded to industry at large as one way of avoiding legislative compulsion . According to Mr. William Menthe , head of the three dominant companies cooperating in the undertaking , the plan is " proving that it can be depended upon to solve problems arising from both seasonal and major depressions . " The plan is based on the theory that employee income guarantee should have the same consideration that is given to a reserve fund for future dividends , and under its operation all factory or office workers continuously employed by one of the companies for one year or more are guaranteed steady employment or cash unemployment benefits . " Should it be found necessary to lay off an employee the management will try to find employment for him at one of the other plants or help the worker seek employment elsewhere , " Mr. Menthe 's description continues . " If employment can not be found at one of the other plants or elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash unemployment benefits are paid to the laid-off worker on each regular pay day . Cash benefits of e computed at 65 per cent of the average wage of the worker during the previous year , and are paid until the worker is again employed , but cash benefits are not paid for more than 100 working days . " Workers unemployed for more than 15 days during any 20-day working period will receive cash unemployment benefits . This in effect guarantees the worker at least halftime employment or cash unemployment benefits for every month during the year and makes for an industrial income to the worker during each month of the year .
