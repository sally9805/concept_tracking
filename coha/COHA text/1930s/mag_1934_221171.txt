On the Starlight Roof Garden of the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan one night last week a cosmopolitan group of well-groomed gentlemen and their ladies sat down for a long and pleasant dinner . No ordinary meal was this . Eleven years ago to the very night Lucius Boomer played host to the same group in his old Waldorf-Astoria down on 34th Street . Now in his bigger &; better Waldorf on Park Avenue Mr. Boomer was again entertaining the officers and executive committee of the International Hotel Alliance . <P> A dinner for the hotel owners of a dozen nations must have given pause to even the tall , amiable president of the Waldorf and his man Oscar . Neatly they spiked their problem with a startling innovation - a U. S. menu U. S. cooked . Mr. Boomer led off with Cape Cods baked in the shell , New Orleans gumbo and Maryland terrapin . His bird was Chesapeake mallard . Frozen applejack preceded Virginia ham and autumn salad which were topped off with souffl Lugol and coffee . <P> Mr. Boomer dusted off bottles of Zeltinger Sonnenblick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The brandy was 1865 , the water Poland . <P> Other guests there were , including Postmaster General Farley , President Merlin Hall Aylesworth of National Broadcasting , Dirigibilist Hugo Eckener and a few of Mr. Boomer 's fellow Manhattan hotelkeepers . But the majority were European hotelmen who bore tales of lean years and no profits . There were a few notable exceptions , who reported good business , but the general tenor of the conference was so sad that most meetings were closed to the Press . <P> Italy . Hotels in Italy were the most prosperous in Europe this year . Benito Mussolini 's swift ships attracted travelers to the southern transatlantic route . When the tourists arrived they got more for their money than in France . Italian prices were slashed by government decree early in the year , railroad rates having been cut as much as 75% . Net result was a 25% increase in hotel business over 1933 . <P> Il Duce was well represented at Mr. Boomer 's dinner . Retiring president of IHA was Cesare Pinchetti , on his first visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owns Rome 's Hotel Bristol , where visiting royalties used to stay . He speaks for the Italian hotel industry in the National Council of the Corporative State ( see p. 23 ) . Short , stout and 46 , he was more excited last week over the prospect of seeing Niagara Falls than over the Waldorf dinner . <P> For the 14 Grand Hotels throughout Italy there was Alfredo Campione , their spade-bearded , up-from-busboy managing director . He it was who pulled that de luxe chain out of the hole after the War and he it was who managed to pay a 5% dividend last year when most of the world 's hotels were lucky to pay taxes . Now 61 , Hotelman Campione is one of the few holders of the order of the Cavalire del Lavoro ( Knight of Labor ) , awarded by the Crown to self-made Italians .
