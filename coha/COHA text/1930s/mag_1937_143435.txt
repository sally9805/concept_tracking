Capital of the State of Illinois , just after it was admitted to the Union in 1818 , was the town of Kaskaskia , picturesquely perched on an island in the Mississippi River , which divides Illinois from Missouri . Kaskaskia had lost its chief distinction long before 1881 , when the meandering Mississippi changed its channel from the west of Kaskaskia Island to the east , washing away part of the town and leaving a willowy , uninhabited slough which now stretches west between Kaskaskia 's 107 inhabitants and the old Missouri shore . Kaskaskia proper still belongs to Illinois . Whether the slough , known as Kaskaskia Commons , belongs to Illinois or Missouri is a question which neither State has troubled to settle , but which last week came to the puzzled attention of Judge George Moore in U. S. District Court in St. Louis . <P> Four years ago Farmers Archie Clark and Oliver Lankford of Kaskaskia , involved with a group of Missouri farmers in a title dispute over a pasture in the Commons , were arrested for trespassing by Sheriff Henry Drury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for seven days . Farmers Clark and Lankford , charging the complainants and Sheriff Drury with false arrest on the ground that they were arrested in Illinois and jailed in Missouri , last week got their $200,000 damage suit before Judge Moore . The defendants produced some witnesses old enough to recall how the river had changed its course , an Army map which assigned the Commons to Missouri . The plaintiffs countered with a map made by the U. S. Geological Survey in 1915 assigning the Commons to Illinois . After three days of testimony Judge Moore ruled that there was insufficient evidence to show that the Commons belonged to Illinois , tacitly awarded it to Missouri by dismissing the suit .
