A high New York State court , peering through a knothole in a legal fence , decided fortnight ago that Nudist Vincent Burke was not guilty of " indecent exposure and openly outraging public decency " when he gave a nudist party in an uptown Manhattan gymnasium . Believing that the court approved the contention of all high-minded nudists that their cult is a matter of Health , Mr. Burke put his head through the legal knothole and crowed : " The court has declared Nudism is legal in New York State and inasmuch as the laws in all the other States are patterned closely after the New York State law , this decision will undoubtedly serve as a model and precedent for the rest of the States " ( TIME , Jan. 7 ) . <P> The crowing reached the alert ears of Alfred Emanuel Smith on the 32nd floor of the Empire State Building . As chairman of the advisory committee of the Legion of Decency which is making cinema companies toe the mark ( TIME , June 11 , et seq . ) , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered so exemplary . It read : " A person who willfully and lewdly exposes his person , or the private parts thereof , in any public place or in any other place where others are present , or procures another so to expose himself is guilty of a misdemeanor . " <P> Exclaimed pious Catholic Smith : " The present penal law is not adequate to prevent public mingling and exhibitions of naked men and women . If such action is not an offense against public decency , this league will ask the Legislature to speedily remedy this defect in the law and make it so . It seems to us inconsistent to take a stand for decency on the screen and ignore this latest challenge to the enforcement of decency in reality , We can not overlook indecency in the substance while condemning it in the shadow . " <P> Thereupon the four-time Governor of New York proposed a new law which he expected the New York Legislature to pass and other State Legislatures to imitate . The Smith proposal : " A person who in any place willfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or more persons of the opposite sex whose persons ... are similarly exposed , or who aids or abets any such act , or who procures another so to expose his person ... or who as owner , manager , lessee , director , promoter or agent , or in any other capacity , hires , leases or permits the land , building or premises of which he is the owner , lessee or tenant , or over which he has control , to be used for any such purposes , is guilty of a misdemeanor . " <P> At this moment the Rev. Dr. Ilsley Boone , onetime minister of a Dutch Reformed church at Oakland , N. J .. stepped forward . Dr. Boone is executive secretary of the International Nudist Conference which publishes an illustrated " health " magazine called The Nudist. *
