txt Some weeks ago the Secretary of the Treasury told a House committee that he would soon ask Congress to extend the legal debt limit for the Federal Government from the present level of $45,000,000,000 to $50,000,000,000 . Shortly thereafter Senator Harrison , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , announced . that he was flatly opposed to increasing by law the present limit of the national debt . Secretary Morgenthau now declares that it is unnecessary " to request at this time " an increase in the limitation in the total debt . The President , at his recommendation , asks merely for an increase in the present limitation of $30,000,000 , - 000 on the face amount of the debt that can be outstanding at any one time in the form of bonds . So Senator Harrison and the " economy bloc " in Congress have won a victory . And as it stands today it is an empty victory . For as long as the present rate of Federal expenditure continues , and taxes are not increased to meet it , our huge deficits must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the accumulated deficit . The inevitable result is that in a year from now Congress will be faced with an " emergency " and will have no alternative but to raise the debt limit . As Secretary Morgenthau himself remarked a week ago , " voting the money and then not raising the debt limit is like closing the barn door after the horse is stolen . " In brief , to concur in the spending program and to object to raising the debt limit is to approve the substance while objecting to the shadow . This confusion of shadow and substance is one of the great dangers to which the economy bloc in Congress is now exposed . It fell into this confusion in its vote on the relief deficiency appropriation . Though it cut the amount asked for by $150,000,000 , it not only acquiesced in , but specifically voted for policies that made it almost inevitable that the major part of the cut would have to be restored . The same confusion occurred , again , in the recent program for tax reform . When expenditures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only in the neighborhood of $5,500,000,000 , an atmosphere of unreality must necessarily surround all such proposals . Important improvements of detail are of course possible , given the same revenue yield ; but it is extremely difficult to keep revenues even at their present level , not to speak of the inevitable increase in them which any practical budget-balancing program would involve , without having them in various ways act as a discouragement to production . When taxes have already reached a given level , it is difficult for even a financial genius to devise additional taxes that will not prove an obstacle to recovery . , But taxes can not be reduced unless expenditures are reduced . In this sense taxes are but the shadow of expenditures . This does not mean that such declarations as the Senate adopted Monday ? " The Congress hereby declares that by reason of continued national deficits beginning in 1931 it is desirable to reduce substantially Government expenditure " ? are not to be welcorned . At the very least such a statement stands in clear opposition to the Administration 's philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declarations can have real meaning only if they are merely a first step . They must be followed , if they are to be effective , by courageous action , not merely regarding specific expenditures , but regarding the policies Which make those expenditures necessary .
