Last year after Depression deficits of $21,000,000 had frayed the fiscal treads of B. F. Goodrich Co. , its president , James Dinsmore Tew , decided it was time for the rubber firm to get a new set of financial tires . He asked his stockholders to approve a new $45,000,000 first mortgage of which $28,000,000 was to be raised immediately . Of this sum $6,000,000 was for working capital to finance increasing business and $22,000,000 was to reduce interest charges by retiring 5 % , 6 % and 7% obligations of Goodrich and its subsidiary , Hood Rubber . This plan was blocked when only 74% instead of the necessary 75% of the stockholders approved . Nigger-in-the-woodpile was Cleveland 's once famed banker and utility tycoon Cyrus Stephen Eaton , whose old firm , Otis &; Co. , having been refused a share in underwriting the proposed issue , circularized Goodrich stockholders to prevent approval of the mortgage ( TIME , July 29 , 1935 ) . Thus for a whole year that tire went unfixed . Last month , however , New York Referee John Godfrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , approved the mortgage plan . <P> Meanwhile Goodrich tire repairers took up the problem of accumulated dividends on Goodrich preferred stock , which by last July had piled up to $35 a share , a total of $10,300,000 overdue . In the first half of this year the company made more money-$2,727,000-than in any first half since 1929 . However , earned surplus , out of which dividend arrears would have to be paid , still amounted to only about a third of the arrearage . In July Goodrich directors proposed a recapitalization plan by which preferred stockholders would give up their birds in the bushes for birds nearer to hand . Each share of 7% $100 par preferred would get 1.4 shares of new $5 no par preferred , leaving the annual dividend prospect unchanged at $7 . For waiving accumulated dividends of $35 a share stockholders would receive half a share of common stock which sold last week for $23 a share . <P> Goodrich stockholders met last week and overwhelmingly approved the recapitalization . Immediately the company announced that its first quarterly dividend of $1.25 on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also announced that its refunding plan would be carried out in a few weeks . Thus Goodrich rolled on , all flats fixed .
