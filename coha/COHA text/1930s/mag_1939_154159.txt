Big guns and shells bearing the well-known trade-mark Skoda , made in Czechoslovakia will henceforth go only to those countries in goosestep with Hitler . The French Schneider-Creusot interests , which since 1920 have had a big interest in Skoda , Europe 's second largest munitions works , last week sold their shares to CzechoSlovak interests . For thus recognizing " changed conditions " in eastern Europe , the former French shareholders were paid $10,300,000 . <P> With French directors out of the way , Skoda 's new corps of German military technicians can go more conveniently about their business of arming Germany and her allies , a task at which the foundries and furnaces of Skoda are most capable .
