The Department of State at Washington still holds the letters filed in the settlement of this estate , letters which played their ' part in the dispute with England over Oregon . " But with all his follies , " adds Howell , " he was a wonderful man ? and worthy to be remembered . . . . The passing , two-penny objects of his expedition were swallowed up in the magnitude of his Gulliverian views . North East America was on the Lilliputian , but he designed North West America to be on the Brobdingnagian scale .

Almost always , all power of resistance on the part of the inhabitants seems after a while and for a limited time to break down , and the plunderers to have free course wherever they go . Then they show an ambition to settle  | in the country and some sort of division of territory takes place . " So was it on the Northwest coast . At first deserters and ne'erdo-wells from sailing vessels established themselves among the Indians . These were poor material for permanent settlement . Then more sober colonists arrived , like the three brothers Abiel , Nathan , and Jonathan Winship , who tried to plant the first colony on the Columbia River in June , 1810 .

So in the migratory pageant of human life , the feet that have led , though they have failed to reach their goal , have paved the way for empire . In these days when much is heard about the rising tide of colour and the melting pot and the impairment of purity by the invasion of inferior hordes , it is disconcerting to see what we did in the Pacific . The reckless derelicts who violated the simplicity of the savages of the Northwest and the South Seas were the offshoot of the self-same stocks that roused a protest from Philadelphia against the shipment of English criminals to the colonies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depredations of the uncivilized were the renegades from civilization ; and in the development of the Northwest they made clearings for their followers . Though the bubbles of the early part of the 18th Century taught people a sorry lesson , the dream of some day planting an emporium upon the Pacific that should proudly face the gorgeous East never waned . Leydard , Jefferson , Morris , Benton , one after another kept clearly in mind the need of American transmontane development even to the shores of the Pacific . We have seen that Phineas Bond held our lack of a depot in the  | Pacific as the weakest point in our commercial prospect . But this we shall consider in greater detail in a later chapter . Meanwhile , there was one man who arrived in New York in 1783 whose practical astuteness and vaulting imagination were soon to give substance to this dream . That man was John Jacob Astor . Astor had come over to Dutch America from Germany by way of London . His official biographer declares that he arrived with coin jingling in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell instruments to the natives . On board he is said to have met a gentleman who gave him valuable information about the fur trade . Astor immediately engaged in the fur business , returned to England with a quantity of furs which he sold at great profit , and then established himself in New York as a merchant . This is the official account . The unofficial version emanating from so judicious a chroni ? cler as Walter Barrett , author of " Old Merchants of New York , " says : " Peanuts ! " sic According to Barrett , Astor arrived by the means which has brought more good citizens to America than the Mayflower , that is , the steerage . Upon his arrival , indignantly avowed his sister , Mrs. Abraham Beninger , wife of a New York baker , " Yakob vas noting put a paker poy and solt pread and kak . " However , within twenty years Astor was a millionaire By 1800 , he is said to have sent a shipment of furs to China , and was already studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Ocean overland and thence by way of Hawaii to China and India . Astor doubtless thought of building up for himself a monopoly similar to that of the British East India Company . The New Yorkers of that day were still accustomed to see the gala uniforms of the East Indiamen , and the Orient still played upon their imagination . While in Philadelphia societies were being organized to encourage useful manufactures and devise uniforms for the people , men 's minds basked obliquely in specimens of Oriental composition selected from the translations of linen merchants in the service of the  | Honourable John Company containing enlightenment on the Bhagavad Gita ( the dialogues of Kreeshna ) and the mysteries of the Hindu pantheon and of Arjoon . New York , though it remained essentially Dutch in its composite for fully twentyfive years after the Revolution , lived in part at least in Asia . During the terrible plague of 1805 , when thousands died of yellow fever and every port in the West Indies , South America , and the United States was put under the ban of quarantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they willed . However slight an incident like that might seem in ordinary times , it can not but appear exaggerated in times of trial and stress . From fever the city jumped into the embargo . It was a period of gloom . Merchants and shipowners saw their trade vanish and their ships rotting in the harbour . Idle seamen were receiving poor relief . To advertise the arrival of a Bengal leopard , the New York Museum announced : " The Leopard , detested name ! While we write , the blood boils with indignation . AMERICANS ? this is not the Leopard who murders your citizens , who tramples on your rights , who violates your flag , who has abused your confidence . No , this Leopard is now harmless , for he is ? dead . " This was insufficient . New York wanted something lively . And in a little while she got it . For this is all by the way , and is nothing , after all , in comparison with the brilliant merchant of that day who could rub an oil lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the City Hall . And such a mandarin at that ? one who could soften the heart of the implacable Jefferson and melt his precious embargo . To such a merchant and such a mandarin Jefferson 's determination to make his Americans walk to the Pacific westward across the continent on foot instead of riding there comfortably on the backs of the winds yielded amiably . The mandarin was Picqua ; the merchant , John Jacob Astor.  | Astor , it seems , dealt not only in furs , but in mandarins . The embargo had embarrassed him , somewhat , he told President Jefferson . An exalted gentleman of China with an aged father at home had come over to America on one of his ships . Regardless of expense , courtesy demanded that he should see this personage to the gates of Canton . But there was that embargo and its three-mile limit . Could n't the restrictions for the sailing of vessels be let down just to help this worthy chief ? Jefferson , the democrat , bowed graciously before this mandarin . From Madison , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation and accepted things at their face value . To his Secretary of the Treasury , Gallatin , he sent a blank passport for the vessel Astor was placing at the disposal of the Chinese , calling attention to that section of the Embargo Act which covered such cases ? cases of " national comity . " Modestly he hoped that " the departure of this individual with good disposition may be the means of making our nation known advantageously at the source of power in China , to which it is otherwise difficult to convey information . " A democracy is in the very nature of things bound to be inconsistent . Breaking down the barriers raised by aristocracy , it allows for the development of character . With the development of character there is of necessity an increased respect for the worthy ? for aristocracy . Jefferson was no fool . His judgment may have been blinded for the moment by the vistas opening to his imagination in our relations with China , and in Astor 's projects for the Northwest trade . He was not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthering the diplomatic ends of the country at a time when the friendship of a great Power like China would have been like a big stick to Europe . Later , in this connection , he made the first important pronouncement of America on Far Eastern affairs when he said : " The opportunity hoped from that , of making known through one of its own characters of note , our nation , our circumstances and character , and of letting that government understand at length the difference between us and the English , and separate us in its policy ,  | rendered that measure a diplomatic one , in my view , and likely to bring lasting advantage to our merchants and commerce with that country . " . . . And who knows but that Jefferson himself was not now a bit shaky about the efficacy of the embargo ? The country that had seen more than one collector and inspector dismissed by the President for not using due diligence in executing the embargoes remained silent in this case . The casual announcement of the sailing of the Beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on August 5 , 1808 , she had sailed , not with a Chinese mandarin , but with a China peddler dressed up in Astor 's Canton silks to play the part . The New York Gazette issued a " Notice to Mandarins ? A Sum of not more than 20,000 , nor less than 50,000 dollars , to be determined by contract , will be paid to a Mandarin who , during the present embargo , will obtain permission from the President of the United States for a ship of from 450 to 500 tons burthen to proceed from New York to Canton and back to New York . " As the Mandarins who reside in the United States did not foresee the present crisis ' and left their credentials at home , they will be permitted to prove their rank and the degree of favour to which they are of course entitled by certificates from any prefect of the French Emperor Napoleon . " The Person who obtains the permission must be one of our red brethren ' who whether a native of Asia or America is immaterial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have an aged father , and as he will not be a candidate for the President 's office , his age may be exaggerated , without offence to Mr. Jefferson . . . . If more than one Mandarin should apply ( as is very probable ) the one whose father is oldest will cxteris paribus ( These words are to be understood in a Chinese sense ) be preferred . " Any of the religions professed by the Mandarins are for common purposes good enough ' but to obtain dispensations from the embargo they ought to be disciples of Confucius . '  | " As attention to physiognomy , dress and manners ' will contribute to the success of the application , on these points advice may be obtained from the New York Philosopher , or at No. 92 Broadway . " The Mandarin who applies must provide Secretary and defray all expenses of shaving and dress ; but if in compliance with Chinese custom they submit to be squeezed a suitable reimbursement will be made in proportion to the value of the permit . " This value will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie ; such a privilege being denied by the Statutes of Congress , and authorized only by the rescripts of the Presi ? dent , in respect to the Embargo Laws . As these wise and learned commentaries have not been published entire , an exemplification of that section which contains the exception in favour of Mandarins must be produced . If , however , the principles of confederation do not permit Mandarins to cover the property of the Citizens of the United States the privilege of exporting money will be unimportant . " No secret partner can be admitted unless the person proposed is acquainted with the President 's rescripts and can give information that the Embargo Laws will be repealed , and in the meantime , how they will be modified , enforced and mitigated with reference to general principles and particular interests . " Proposals addressed to X. Y. Z. will be considered and by due secrecy observed . " August 9 , 1808 . " Within a few days the truth of the situation began to dawn upon people , and the political aspects of the permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the 13th , the Commercial Advertizer of New York expressed itself editorially : " The ship Beaver and the Mandarin : The public attention is particularly invited to transactions of a most extraordinary complexion . " A first rate Merchant ship , which will be navigated by  | about 30 seamen , is preparing for sea , and is expected to proceed on a voyage to Canton , in a few days , under a special permission from the President of the United States . " The ostensible object of this voyage is to carry home a person who is said to be a Mandarin of China . " It is , however , well known that the person for whom permission has been obtained is no Mandarin ; is not even a licensed or security Merchant : ? that his departure from China was contrary to the law of that country ; that if he arrives in China he will be put on shore privately , and that the obscurity of his condition in life affords him the only chance he has of avoiding punishment . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not accept all the property of all the Chinese in this country as compensation for the voyage , and it is known that he offered to contract for bringing home goods on freight . " Whatever may have been the motives of the President in granting a permission , it is however certain that the object of the owner of the ship is to make a China voyage during a time when other Merchants are restrained by the Embargo . " The time of granting this permission is remarkable : it is when the general Embargo is imposed on all commerce with our nearest neighbors ; when exchange of domestic produce with Canada , New Brunswick and the Floridas is interdicted by an armed force ? when the intercourse of our city in our own bays , rivers and harbours , in small boats , incapable of a sea voyage , is subject to the most rigorous control of the Custom House ; nay , more , this permission is to go into effect when on account of some new and unknown political necessity all other permissions which have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most valuable ; the number of seamen exposed to peril the greatest in any Merchant 's service , and the voyage , not to the West Indies , but to the Antipodes . " If the Government has been surprised and the permission obtained by any misrepresentation , the error can be vindicated , the honour of the administration and the reputation of all concerned , require that the explanation be made .  | " Fellow-Citizens , let us observe the progress of this affair : ? if the trade is safe , and can be prosecuted consistently with the public interests , let all who are willing , engage in it ; otherwise , let all be restrained : let there be an embargo , or no embargo ; but let us not countenance partial dispensations from the operation of general laws . " The Beaver sailed , however , and Astor came back at them with an airy impenitence free from the dust of argument : " To THE EDITOR OF THE Commercial Advertizer : " MR . LEWIS : I observe in your paper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions ( as is there stated ) of a most extraordinary complexion , relative to the ship Beaver and the Mandarin . If the author of the piece will please give his name , and if he is not prejudiced against every action of the Administration , nor influenced by envy arising from jealousy he shall receive a statement of facts relative to the transaction in question , which will relieve him from the anxiety in which he appears to labor for the honor of the government , and the reputation of all concerned . He shall be convinced that the government has not been surprised by misrepresentation in granting permission , and that the reputation of those concerned can not in the slightest degree be affected . " By giving the above a place in your paper you will oblige , Sir , " Your humble servant , " JOHN JACOB ASTOR . " " NEW YORK , Aug. 15 , 1808 . " Astor proved to be no niggardly host , content with merely discharging an obligation . While he was about it he was determined to treat his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take him to China , but to give him a ride up the Northwest coast . Incidentally , they might pick up a few thousand dollars ' worth of furs . When the Beaver returned to America , after this philanthropic and diplomatic mission , she was worth $200,000 more than when she started .  | The successful voyage of the Beaver brought to maturity a scheme which Astor had long had in mind . The treaty with Great Britain in 1795 had made possible the direct shipment of furs from Canada to the United States even as the Nootka Sound controversy had determined the sending of a diplomatic representative from England to the United States , long withheld . Thus at one stroke , as it were , it made possible the drainage of Northern furs from both coasts and enhanced the value of such traffic in China . Astor at once saw that to remain master of the Eastern fur trade he would also have to obtain a hold on the Western main . Furthermore , between 1789 and 1800 three new states and three territories had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to men like Jefferson was the very breath of national life . To offset the possibility of France developing the Mississippi region he had purchased Louisiana . While he had no hope of imperialism for the States , he did look forward eagerly to the time when new democratic nations would rise up in the West as a buffer against European aggrandizement . Hence , when Astor approached Jefferson through his friend Madison with the details of his scheme for founding an emporium on the Northwest coast , Jefferson saw at a flash that there lay security , and commended him for his efforts , and offered him " every facility and protection which the government could properly afford . " Again it was a capable , practical financier who conceived a project the wealth and splendour of which could not but be , for a time at least , an ignis fatuus . " From this great mart , " says Bancroft , " seated at the entrance of the mighty River of the West , yielding to none in wealth , magnitude , or position , and imposing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from this vast emporium sailing vessels of every build and burden would make regular voyages to north and south , and to Asia , to Europe , to Boston , New York and Philadelphia . It would indeed be a smooth , glittering , golden round .  | furs from Astoria to Canton , teas and silks , and rich Asiatic merchandise to New York , then back again to the Columbia with beads and bells and blankets , guns , knives , tobacco and rum . " This new scheme was announced to Manhattan with a romantic flourish . One fair twilight evening in summer the good burghers of the Manhattoes heard singing along their waterfront floating in on that fresh smell of the evening tide which even to-day creeps up through the smoke and gasoline vapours of the city on summer nights . Deserting their stoeps on which they usually sat at ease at this time of day , in all the comfort of tobacco and good gossip , the more inquisitive citizens reached their docks in time to recognize the serenaders . Carolling as they paddled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be-plumed , came down the Hudson and around Battery Park and into the East River and floated up the other side of the island , singing all the way , and at last swung leisurely to landward . All the way from Montreal they had been parading their prowess and creating a wild sensation . They had navigated their canoes across Lake Champlain and had transported them overland to the Hudson ; then paddled down the full length of that magnificent fiord . It was a sight suitable for the grandest of water carnivals , and the appreciative cosmopolitans knew how to manifest their approval . These were the trappers whom Astor had imported to be sent as guides to the new station beyond the Rockies . The Beaver was ready for a second voyage and was to bear them away round the Horn to lay the foundations for a new commercial state , for " A colony that would form the germ of a wide civilization ; that would , in fact , carry the American population across the Rocky Mountains and spread it along the shores of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forces for dissolution were already at work . In fact , even as the voyageurs were gaily dispensing their balladry they were scheming for the disintegration of the project , it seems , for there was an element of national jealousy mixed up with their own private selfish ambitions . Nevertheless , at the coast they found some  | Russians and some British ahead of them , but they proceeded to plant their settlement in all earnestness . One of the men Astor had sent out , M'Dougal , married an Indian princess , daughter of the chief Comcomly , and attempted to establish a petty empire of his own . But difficulties arose , and matters soon got beyond control . Astor had sent a follow-up supply ship , the Tonquin , which brought with it tragedy and disaster . The Tonquin fell a-foul of the Indians , who succeeded in boarding the vessel by a ruse , massacred the captain and all the crew with the exception of one man who , fatally wounded , locked himself in a cabin . During the night he dragged himself about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians returned for plunder the next day , he set off the fuse and blew up the ship . Over a hundred Indian men , women , and children were strewn upon the waters , in ghastly retribution for their treachery . Astor lost about $400,000 in the affair . On the third voyage of the Beaver she gathered some $25,000 worth of furs and sailed for Canton . Had the captain acted promptly he would have disposed of them for $150,000 , but desire for fairer gain made him hold back . Suddenly news arrived of the war with England , the captain was scared , remained , borrowed money at 18 per cent . and the entire venture petered out . Astoria was captured by the British and was not returned till 1818 , and then only formally . And so again a great design was frustrated . " Such in brief was the enterprise projected by Mr. Astor , " declares Washington Irving , the historiographer of the adventure , " but which continually expanded in his mind . Indeed it is due to him to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit . He was already wealthy beyond the ordinary desires of man , but he now aspired to that honourable fame which is awarded to men of similar scope of mind , who by their great commercial enterprises have enriched nations , peopled wildernesses , and extended the bounds of empire . "  | AFTER the War of 1812 , Boston was in a mood for adventure at any cost . The Peace Ball of 1815 , of which one Boston belle , arrayed in " sheer white muslin dress , with a bodice of white satin , " has left an account in her diary , not omitting the British officers flirting with the ladies as blandly as if there had been no war , reawakened the cry that society was losing its tone and exclusiveness . Along with the growth of democracy came pretentiousness and , perhaps , the silliest dress and customs that ever restricted the feminine half of the human race . The revolutionary dames in whom an admiring Frenchman ( Abbe Robin ) had found the beauty of the " grave big women of antique statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight-laced , weeping daughters of affectation . The ruddy , stout , harddrinking Puritans of pre-revolutionary times began to attenuate and fade into characteristic Yankee types , sallow of skin and troubled with indigestion . " I am satisfied that such a set of black-coated , stiff-jointed , soft-muscled , paste-complexioned youth as we can boast of in our Atlantic cities never before sprang from loins of Anglo-Saxon lineage , " wrote Oliver Wendell Holmes of this period . But he goes on to tell us that it was also a " fighting , drinking , swearing time , " when the " habits of parlour and kitchen with regard to alcoholic drinks were very free and hazy , " though Harvard boys dined frugally on succotash and hominy , and wore homespun , except on holidays . Mothers who could not afford the protection of Harvard hailed the comparatively safe precincts of the sea as a refuge for their growing sons . When one youngster of fourteen announced his determination to become a sailor , his mother , instead of collapsing as he expected , said she thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " why do you say that ? "  | " Well , " she answered , " if you were at sea I should know better where you were nights than I have been able to for some time . " When his sea chest was packed , he slipped in a box of cigars which had been the gift of a schoolmate . One lonesome day on shipboard , when he looked for his cigars to comfort him , he found that his sainted mother had substituted a copy of Barters ' " Saint 's Rest . " And so the stream of young men out into the world increased , till men from New England were scattered over every isle and islet of the far Pacific . Every ship that slipped from an Atlantic port harboured some secret schemer who never intended to return , the interest of those they left behind became firmly fixed upon that invisible horizon . Wherever else they might by chance be thrown , one place above all others became the lodestone of their desires , and that was Hawaii . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there to thaw out from their garments the stinging frost that had nipped their very souls . To Alaska and Oregon they went of necessity , but not a heart but was glad when the helm was turned toward Hawaii . Where was the white man more generously received ? There they gathered in a week-end manner , as it were , till , as Morison has said , Hawaii was regarded as a suburb of Boston . In time a motley crew of derelicts gathered to make merry among these pleasant savages . Mainly it was composed of men who had deserted . Concealing themselves in the fernwoods while their ship was yet in port , they emerged as soon as it left with a cheery anticipation of their fate . As the son of an Hawaiian missionary once said : " When they came forth from their hiding they were at once captured by the native police and in obedience to the law were incontinently clapped into jail . But this little ceremony did not in the least interfere with their pleasures . The jail was simply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of the government . Our jolly jack-tars accepted the hospitality of  | the jailor at mealtime and when it rained . But the balance of their time was joyously occupied with the society of their numerous friends whenever and wherever they willed . " If the policeman was amenable to reason , they accepted his escort with resignation ; if not , they clubbed him into submission . Once , finding the law unusually obstreperous , they raised " the piratical flag and armed with bludgeons , they marched around the town , roaring ribald songs and shouting defiance as they went . " Their impudence exceeding the generosity of even those primitive laws , the helpless Hawaiian king would call upon an alien man-of-war to put down their pretensions . In view of these manifestations of character , one begins to understand a little more clearly the puritanical regulations required in God-fearing New England . For a time Hawaii had to make shift with the " offscourings of earth , " but as more and more white men arrived , some semblance of order and decency began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business found these jolly tars a little too much for their peace of mind . Things might have adjusted themselves slowly but for the unfortunate discovery that the islands contained forests of sandalwood , precious in all the lands of the Orient for making chests , and as incense with which to propitiate the gods . Hitherto India had been the main source of supply , but it could not provide enough for the whole market . To the Americans now in search of a substitute for furs , which were becoming more expensive and more difficult to get , the South Seas , with their sandalwood and beche-de-mer , became another dispensation from Heaven . Hardly had Salem got through sneezing deliciously over the pepper discovered at Bencoolen , Sumatra , when the godly Quakers began gathering the precious sandalwood of the South Seas and conveying it to China , to soothe the nostrils of the very Joss the missionaries went out to destroy . It seems that the nearer the white barbarians drew to the Celestial realms , the more incense did his offended nose demand . As early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaii and had left two men to see that it was  | gathered by Kamehameha , whose primitive treasury was soon filled with Spanish dollars and gold . As the years went by , the tastes and standards of the natives became more sophisticated . But it was not till after the War of 1812 that any extensive traffic in sandalwood began to disturb the economic and social conditions of the islands . In 1815 , Bryant &; Sturgis sent the Ophelia to Canton , instructing the captain to stop at Valparaiso and inform such American refugees as may have rushed there of the end of the war , and to buy copper which he was to take to Galapagos to be exchanged for whales ' teeth , thence to sail for Ingraham 's Island and the Sandwich Islands ( Hawaii ) for sandalwood , which in turn was to be taken to China to be traded for tea and silk . Perkins instructed one of his captains to secure sandalwood from the king of the Sandwich Islands , his argument being : " A cargo of sandalwood procured without funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copper , but in the sandalwood voyage no stock is employed other than the ship . " If the king should delay , the captain was to proceed to Norfolk Sound for furs and sealskins , leaving one of his mates as hostage to satisfy the king of his intentions . Should all his prospects fail , he was to go to Batavia for coffee and return to Boston . If , however , the Dutch should want him to make a trip to Japan for them , as they had done with the Massachusetts and the Franklin , he was to take in this extra voyage before returning . But the sandalwood was successful and continued to be so for years . The stir of life that commenced so innocently in Hawaii was soon a raging torrent . From the quiet days of Kendrick things changed to revelry and abandon . When Richard Cleveland , the writer-captain , passed there in 1803 he left the first horse to be seen on the islands . Its mettle and beauty had created mingled terror and admiration , but the king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horseman . The natives , too , soon acquired more sophisticated tastes , and were all happy that there upon their islands stood vast tracts of valuable wood ? valuable to the white man , but the intrinsic worth of which they had no way of properly appraising . This the  | traders , naturally , were not too eager to do for them . The calicoes and cambrics , large-sized ladies ' shoes , ready-made clothes , bonnets , cheap furniture , broadcloth , articles with much show and colour in them , lured the simple people into the forests where they toiled in the cutting of the wood that went down to the sea in ships . The Hawaiian king found no difficulty in making promises to pay for his newly acquired tastes . He had little concern about the future . If his creditors threatened to force payment , every male and female on the island was taxed in wood to meet government debts incurred during moments of great hilarity or for such necessities as billiard tables and yachts . When after Crowninshield 's death , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder and the envy of Europe , arrived in Honolulu and was offered for sale , it won the king 's heart . He would not look upon another vessel , and another bargain in sandalwood was completed . He paid $60,000 , or fully six times her original cost , for her . Every vessel brought with it some new contrivance . A mirror , not worth $50 , Mrs. Judd says was sold for from $800 to $1,000 . The whole standard of living had risen by leaps and bounds , and the clever trader was there to encourage it ? even if he had to use his foot on the scale as the wood was being weighed . One of these traders was Mr. Jones . " Treat Mr. Jones civilly , " wrote Bryant &; Sturgis , " but avoid having anything to do with him if possible . " Mr. Jones wrote to his firm advising them what to send . " Coarse articles are of no use , " he said . " Were I at home myself I could select an outfit that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carts , wheel barrows , carriages , and one or two of those vehicles called barrouches , two or three chaises . You might be surprised that such articles would sell , but you would be more surprised to see how fast these people are advancing toward civilization ; only two days since Mr. Pitt asked me to send over three carriages and have them adorned with gold . " In a letter to Marshall of Boston we learn that " Tamoree  | one of the blood-royal is now here with the King and all the chiefs . They have been visiting and having high times for this four months past . Perhaps they may now attend to business . Have hopes to fill the ship by December . . . . Tamoree has . . . married Carhamano , and I assure you they appear like a young married couple . " The world loves a lover , but business is nevertheless business , and this royal amour was holding up the sandalwood trade . " I am afraid our word will be worth nothing in China , " declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have now owed us at the Islands over 1300 piculs of sandalwood . This will take some time to collect , especially at Atooi , but I have no fears but that we shall eventually obtain all . The circumstances of Tamoree 's coming up here and his marriage with Carhamano has been accountable to our cause . He remains here still , almost afraid to say his soul 's his own . Whenever he speaks of going to Atooi , his lady is immediately taken ill . He told me in confidence a few days since that he was miserable and wished the devil would take Carhamano . Whether they ever intend he should return is hard to say . Some think not . The ways of these people are past finding out . Not long since I had a conversation with Rheo Rheo on the subject . I told him how anxious Tamoree was to return , reminded him of the large debt he was owing . He replied he was at liberty to go when he pleased , and if he could not pay his debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts we had from Atooi , all the chiefs and people had returned to the mountains to cut wood . Tamoree 's former Queen now rules at Atooi , the Brig is called hers , and she holds herself obligated to pay for it . We have her name to the obligation . As I have written you before , our most bitter and professed enemy at Atooi is Mr. George Tamoree , one of the most finished rascals the islands afford . His last act of villainy has completely established his infamy . Captain Masters came up here the last week , his dwelling house having been destroyed by fire ; and who do you think was the incendiary ? no one less than Mr. George Tamoree , and merely because Capt .

He was convinced of the magnitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to make good the amount destroyed . " And more sandalwood came walking down the hills on the backs of native men and women . The value of sandalwood was adventitious , though it yielded an enormous profit . On the whole , this commerce tended to demoralize those who engaged in it . In " The Crater , " James Fenimore Cooper makes this traffic the pivot of a romance . His hero spends two months cruising about the mighty deeps in search of sandalwood islands . Having found his island , he makes a contract with the natives for specified amounts of the wood and departs elsewhere to return in two or three months for the cuttings . Her holds filled , the vessel proceeds to Canton for the usual commerce with the Chinese . His hero even returns to Philadelphia where , with all due secrecy , he musters a colony for the mid-Pacific . " So long as the sandal-wood lasted , so long would it be in the power of the colonists to coin money ; while it was certain that competitors would rush in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known . " Had the natives remained in their blissful innocence of the true value of sandalwood , there would doubtless have arisen no misunderstandings between them and the whites . But along with the inrush of competitors for the wood and the less selfish concern of the missionaries , troubles enough were soon brewing . Bloodshed could not long be averted . The loss of life in this traffic throughout the South Sea Islands at one time exceeded the toll taken by the leviathan . It was ranked as one of the most hazardous of callings . The whaling industry , while it made large returns , demanded industry , courage , perseverance , and a fair amount of capital . But there was so much to be gained from speculation in the wood that men became reckless . During the height of the traffic it meant affluence and prof- ligacy to the chiefs who in all their days had never dreamed of such easy wealth . In one year alone more than $400,000 worth of wood had been cut . Before 1820 it was being shipped somewhat steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it began to be cut not only indiscriminately but wastefully , without adequate places for storing it , or consideration for the well-being of the natives who , in poverty and in excess of their energy , were driven through direct taxation to bringing down more and ever more sandalwood . In an effort to gain control of the trade , the king , in a moment of sobriety , thought he would engage in the shipments himself direct with China , seeing how rich the foreign merchants were becoming . So he dispatched a vessel to Canton , under British officers and a native supercargo ? the first to carry the Hawaiian flag into any port in the world . But through the dishonesty of those in charge the profits were spent in riotous living in China , and the ship came back to the king $3,000 in debt for the voyage . So the king determined to establish pilot and customs duties by way of recuperation for the loss his kingdom was enduring , but again the profligacy of his son Liholiho , to whom life was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin , until through extortion , rapine , and neglect of tilling the soil the country was virtually ravaged and despoiled . Once the king swore off drinking and would have kept his promise , but he was enticed on board a vessel and assured that cherry wine was harmless ? and all his vows went overboard . It was not till 1830 that any constructive conscientious effort on the part of the rulers ? this time the Governor of Oahu , Kuakini ? sought to banish liquor from the islands . Though he bent over backward , he was able only slightly to curtail , not to eliminate , the evil . But for ten years another influence was at work , as alien to the Hawaiians as the evil that was consuming them ? the labours of the missionaries . From the beginning there were not a few pious people who looked upon the traffic in sandalwood with compunction .  | " Sandalwood , " says Cooper , " was . . . a branch of commerce , by the way , which ought never to be pursued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear of its uses in China can be true . There it is said to be burned as incense before idols , and no higher offence can be committed by any human being than to be principal , or accessory , in any manner or way , to the substitution of any created thing for the everliving God . " But if the pious had had their way , where would the poor trader have found anything that did not minister to some alien idol ? Where is the poor trader going to get a living if the pious have their way ? And so all the blame for all the troubles at the time was heaped upon the missionary . From the time of the first discovery of the heathen after the trader came into the Pacific , American hearts had been pulsating with a cosmic consciousness , and the souls of those heathen became their daily concern . The trader had been followed thither by the whaler , and the whaler by the gospeller , and before very long the hitherto misty , stormy , aquatic wilderness became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absconders , and transplanted merchants , to which were soon added the missionary and the diplomat . In 1819 , the first boat-load sailed from Boston with a band of singing pilgrims who were bent not upon a place wherein they could practise their own beliefs in their own way , but on unrelenting war upon the faiths of savagedom . The effort had begun with the mission school in Connecticut , which the Reverend John Pierpont , grandfather of the Morgans , of Litchfield , Connecticut , commemorated in a poem from which we cull the following : For Orient queens their radiance to throw , With gold and silver , from a rich trousseau . The historian of the occasion tells us : " In 1817 the Foreign Mission School was established in Cornwall ( Connecticut ) . The origin of the effort , if not accidental , was gradual in its conception . Two young natives of the Sandwich Islands were by the directing and almost visible hand of Providence thrown  | among us and fell under the notice of Mr. Elias Cornelius , in 1815 . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known among us , were Henry Obookiah and William Tanoe . They were not long after joined by Thomas Hopoo , their countryman . . . . A more liberal and enlarged project was conceived ; a Seminary in a Christian land for the instruction of the heathen , joined with the purpose . . . . Young natives of the Sandwich Islands , from China , Australasia , and from the Indian nations on this continent , as well as American youths , were instructed here . " By 1819 , these three converts from Hawaii sailed for home with seven missionaries on the ship Thaddeus , and on March 31 , 1820 , they arrived off Kohala . The first officer of the brig was James Hunnewell , agent of Bryant &; Sturgis for Hawaii . Reports on the very pious state of Tahiti as a result of British missionary efforts had stirred American ambitions . " No fire in canoes on Sunday , " read the report , " no journey , no weekly business , all their former sports and amusements completely put down . You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush at thy own interiority in this respect , with this so lately barbarous land ! " How those Tahitians did fall for rest days ! What then was their amazement when Mr. Hunnewell returned from a reconnoitring trip to Kohala to the Thaddeus with the announcement : " Liholiho is king ; the tabus are abolished ; the idols are burned ; the temples are destroyed . There has been war , but now there is peace . " This miracle had occurred the year before , when , at a feast ( from which women were not to be debarred ) , prepared by Kaahumanu , Liholiho had joined a number of other chiefs and had eaten in the presence of the multitudes . Seeing no blast from Heaven descending upon him for the breaking of the tabu against eating with women , the people raised a joyful shout , " The tabus are at an end and the gods are a lie ! " These good tidings sent the Thaddeus merrily on its way to Kailua , where on April 4 , 1820 , it came to anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shouting natives  | in a state of nature , including the king and his queens , were playing on the beach and sporting in the surf ? as only Hawaiians can ? laughing heartily . The missionaries , observing their nakedness , were shocked by the " appalling darkness of the land we had come to enlighten . " . . . The more white people came , the more appalling became the darkness . That the catch which brought Kaahumanu into the fold was not an inconsiderable one we have on the evidence of an eyewitness , Laura Fisher Judd , wife of the famous missionary doctor . She was only twenty-four years old when she landed there in 1828 , a bride . The Governor , Manuia , in semimilitary fashion and employing a semi-intelligible English , received this new group of missionaries very amiably . He ordered vehicles to convey them to their mission , which was about a mile from Honolulu , the vehicles being a yellow onehorse wagon and two blue handcarts , all drawn by natives . Mrs. Judd says she preferred to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the queen , Kaahumanu , came to visit them , to receive them into her realms . Her retinue was large , and included of course the usual kahili bearer , the enormous feather fan or umbrella , and " still another bearing her spittoon . " Her Majesty rode backward , with her feet hanging down behind the cart , displaying ankles which Mrs. Judd declares , upon her honour , to have measured eighteen inches in circumference , while the cart was loaded with 400 pounds of royalty in one magnificent bundle . We further learn that after the feast of reason had satisfied the queen " a sound something between a whistle and the groan of a blacksmith 's bellows " was heard and the august lady announced her desire to return . " She rose ( I never saw her look so tall ) , gathered up the ample folds of her black silk dress , even to the very waist , holding a portion on each arm , and exposing an undergarment of beautiful pink satin . Thus she stood in her stateliness , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The friendliness and intimacy between the missionaries and the natives could not , in the circumstances , but create trouble  | with the traders . The traders had set out to help the missionaries . " Tell the missionaries , " wrote Bryant &; Sturgis to Captain John Suter , " that we shall bring the frame of their house in the Tartar free of freight , and as we do so much for them , they must aid you if they can . " So far the cooperative spirit between missionary and trader was in excellent order . But many years had not gone by before a change came over the Hawaiian world . The non-ecclesiastical emigres found this transplantation of Boston a little too much to swallow . They could put up with the hair-cloth furniture easily enough , and might even favour the " frame houses shipped round the Horn , " but when it came to the New England Sabbath their endurance was strained excessively . The missionaries were forgetting too easily what they owed the traders at home . " The effects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tending , as fast as possible , to lay waste the whole country , and plunge the inhabitants into Civil War and bloodshed . Thousands of acres of land that before produced the finest crops , are now sandy plains . Provisions are so extremely scarce , that not long since , the king sent to beg a little bread of the American Consul ; the fishery is almost deserted , and nothing flourishes but the missionary school . " The American " Consul " was one Mr. Jones . " The natives are too much enlightened , " wrote Jones to Mr. Marshall of Boston . " They know well the value of every article . If they do not there are plenty of canting , hypocritical missionaries to inform them , even though unasked . Trade will never again flourish at these islands till these missionaries from the Andover mill are recalled . They are continually telling the king and chiefs that the white traders are cheating and imposing on them . Consequently they have depreciated the value of most articles . I believe that it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty per cent . worse in every vice since the missionaries began their hypocritical labours here . These blood-suckers of the community had much better be in their native country gaining their living . "  | The year after , Jones , who was to be treated civilly , wrote again to his chief : " All business , all occupation , all labour have ceased and religion , the most absurd and unreasonable , stalks throughout this land , spreading desolation and misery . The missionaries have succeeded in frightening these poor simple children of nature into the belief of a religion they do not understand themselves ? the creed of which is a libel on the goodness of God . . . . The sound of the church-going bell is heard from the rising to the setting sun , and religion is rammed down the throats of these poor simple mortals whilst certain famine and destruction are staring them in the face .

" Of Bingham , the famous missionary , Elwell wrote : " Bingham and family have gone to Ohwyhee for the improvement of his health . There is some hope that he will not survive the climate long . With all my heart I say God send a speedy delivery . " In that raw , unschooled world , where antagonisms reverted to old principles and primitive impulses , where strange codes afforded an easy escape from one realm of existence to another , from one standard of conduct to another , it was a marvel that even so much restraint prevailed . When , in due course , the natives saw their old tabus cast down and defied , when conversions took place by the thousand under the exhortation of Titus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings applied new theories to economics in the disposition of uncomfortable debts . And so kings and chiefs went into worldly bankruptcy and when pressed by the foreign traders threw themselves upon the mercy of the foreign God . " He has given himself entirely to God , and wishes nothing to do with earthly con- cerns , " wrote a correspondent . " The king and principal chiefs are in the mountains . The old woman is here , - as sanctified as ever . " The traders damned the missionaries , and the missionaries reserved space in a lurid hereafter for the traders . The king discovered that within his domains abounded masters of vessels who regarded themselves as responsible to their owners alone ; sailors who defied all temporal and spiritual supremacy ; missionaries who held themselves responsible to God and to God alone ; and mercenaries whose economic weapon was at least as effective as the authority of all other rulers combined .

But everything is relative ; and I dare say that to a worn-out old sea-dog , after six months of imprisonment among rats and cockroaches in the filthy forecastle of a nasty old-fashioned whaleship , any decent habitation , no matter how poor , must have seemed like a palace . " By 1825 , reports of progress began to emanate not only from missionaries , but from business men . " Thus the benefits as well as evils of civilization are greatly spreading throughout these remote regions , leaving the question still undetermined whether savage or cultivated men be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in that year recognized by the king as the basis of a code of laws .  | Among those who now had to live under this new scheme was a Bostonian ( Mr. Benjamin P. ) , who had left his home to seek a fortune in Canton . Suddenly his letters ceased coming to his family at home , and to discover what had happened to him , his nineteen-year-old son set out for the East . In China he learned that his father had gone to Hawaii , and so pursued him . Upon his arrival he found his father happily sequestered in the bosom of a Hawaiian home , his mate a native princess . His ire was soon turned to envy , and before many a day went by the boy himself had won unto himself a princess , and neither of them ever returned to the land of their fathers . In time the sandalwood gave out and life settled down to more creative undertakings .

Munger assures us that when in doubt as to whether to go to California or remain on the islands , everyone encouraged him in the latter , and he found that there was more money in a dining saloon than in the goldfields . In time , great firms arose , and men of fine calibre took their places within counting-houses . Intermarriage between the whites and the natives was always encouraged and always indulged . Chinese had arrived , with their hair a yard long , vibrating from side to side as they strode along in their gorgeous costumes and on wooden-soled shoes . Their arrogance in that day earned for them more respect than their humility does to-day . A contemporary was so moderate in his regard for them that he noted : " The colour of these Chinese is more sallow than that of Europeans .

Hawaii had graduated from its status as the suburb of Boston and became , what it has always remained , the Pearl of the Pacific .  | Thus backward and forward across the waters of the Pacific man was weaving the fabric of civilization . A certain Doctor Lathrop , a short , stout , and kindly tempered little man , returned to America with a handsome fortune . His son George , a lively little fellow , grew up to marry a daughter of Nathaniel Hawthorne . Interest in the two regions grew more mutual and more intimate . Mothers who had dispatched their boys and never heard from them again gave stir to an agitation for the naval patrol of the Pacific to hunt for stranded Americans by some believed to be held in slavery by the savages , or waiting hopelessly for some chance visitation of a vessel . Hawaiians had begun slowly to make their way to Boston . Amaso Delano tells in his voyages that he had been induced to take away with him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wives of a Hawaiian king . " To the boy I gave the name of Bill ' and brought him with me to Boston , where his merits were duly appreciated , and he was generally known . . . . He performed on the Boston stage several times in the tragedy of Captain Cook and was much admired by his audiences and the public in general . " But when Delano subsequently returned to Hawaii without the lad , the earlier friendliness manifested toward him was turned to sullen distrust and hate . The Hawaiians , converted , were looking abroad to their fellow Polynesians . James Hunnewell quotes a vivid description by an Hawaiian of his efforts to convert the Marquesans . " We came away to seek the salvation of the souls of this people because our hearts were full of the love of God . . . When I saw your countryman , a citizen of this great nation , ill-treated and about to be baked and eaten as a pig is eaten , I ran to save him , full of pity and grief at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boat for the stranger 's life . This boat came from James Hunnewell . A gift of friendship , it became the ransom of a countryman of yours , that he might not be eaten by savages who know not Jehovah . "  | But a still more touching picture comes to us when the Hawaiians , led to believe that all people in the Christian lands knew joy and happiness , and that all Christians , like the missionaries , were kind , made their way to Boston as to some distant Arcadia . Educated by the missionaries , many of them came with glowing hopes and wild anticipations . It was easy for them to sign on ships at Hawaii , but when they were paid off in Boston , they were usually dumped into Negro rooming houses ( the white men 's houses would not receive them ) and , after three or four days of furious dissipation expressly prepared for the sailor , they were turned out upon the streets , homeless , penniless , and often shivering in the raw sunshine , and looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for friendliness . With so many white sailors to choose from they were seldom re-engaged by the ships . Heartsick , bewildered , shivering with cold , they wandered around the streets , living comfortably enough during the brief summer on the warm country highways where blackberries and strawberries . grew and a farmer 's vegetables and fruit could now and then be harmlessly pilfered . But in winter they were the most miserable of ailing and tortured animals , slinking here and there into shelters only to be kicked out again . For all this , the papers testify that they remained quiet , inoffensive , never disturbing public peace , nor joining in mutinies and full of reverence through it all for the missionaries who had taught them and whose prototypes they kept hoping to find in this dreary land .  | HOWEVER neatly Salem and Boston may have halved the Pacific Ocean between them , there was another group of Americans that by the testimony of Herman Melville , who knew all about it , could still claim seven eighths of the globe as their own . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escort of the Salem frigate , the Essex . The Essex had been built in response to a public notice that was posted in Salem in 1798 when the Americans were having so much trouble with the French ships . " To the Sons of Liberty : All true lovers of Liberty step forth and give assistance in building a frigate to oppose French insolence and piracy . Let every man in possession of a white oak tree be ambitious to be foremost in hurrying down the timber to Salem where the noble structure is to be fabricated to maintain your rights upon the seas . . . . Your largest and longest trees are wanted , and the arms of them for knees and rising timber . " A little later a second notice appeared , thanking the people of Essex County for their " spirited exertions in bringing down the trees of the forest for the frigate . " In 1812 , the Essex , in command of Captain Porter , was on her way to join two other ships in a cruise in Far Eastern waters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South Pacific and were in pursuit of the rest . Whereupon , on his own initiative , Porter rounded the Horn and went speeding after both captor and captive . He succeeded in rescuing the Americans , and then proceeded on a retaliatory cruise of his own , in which he practically drove all the British whalers off the Pacific . From then on , for the next sixty years , the American whaler was virtually supreme in those waters . Aside from the earnings which poured into humble American homes from the pursuit of the leviathan , there trailed in their wake traditions and myths that have worked their way into the consciousness of the entire country . While the Indiamen , down to the winged clippers , ensnared the merchant and captivated the mind with their swift , direct journeyings to and from the East , the ponderous , tubby , cumbersome whalers were rolling hither and yon over the lone and trackless seas . The gold and the silks and gems of the East fired the hopes of avarice ; the whalers had little to dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambergris . To them the ambergris was the Gold of Ophir . The profits of the East India merchants which dazzle the fancy , significant though they are in the development of the New World , dwindle before the far-reaching achievements of the whalers . They in their venturesomeness , knowing no intimidation , plunged into uncharted seas and hovered about even the forbidden waters of Japan . To them is primarily due the sweeping of the Pacific of all its terrors and the throwing into the discard of the thought of any national isolation . The oft-quoted passage from Burke appraising the place of the whaler in the geography of human expansion was printed by the New-York Packet on May 18 , 1787 . " Whilst we trace them among the tumbling mountains of ice , " said Burke , " and behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson 's Bay , and David Straits ; whilst we look for them beneath the arctic circle we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar cold , that they are at the Antipodes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falkland Island , which seems too remote and romantic an object for the grasp of national ambition , is but a stage and a resting-place in the progress of their victorious industry . Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging to them than the accumulated winter of both poles . We know that while some of them draw the line and strike the harpoons upon the coast of Africa , others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along the coast of Brazil . No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries . No climate that is not witness to their toils . Neither the perseverance of Holland , nor the dexterous and firm sagacity of English enterprise , ever carried this most perilous mode of hardy industry to the extent to which it has been pursued by these recent people : ? a people who are still as it were but in the gristle and not yet hardened into the bone of manhood . " A few years later he would have had to include numerous previously unknown regions of the Pacific in his forensic survey . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns and communities not otherwise engaged in the China trade ? Nantucket , Martha 's Vineyard , New Bedford , New London , and New Haven . Everyone from Cape Cod to Long Island had tried to intercept an occasional whale , and it is even said that the Pilgrim Fathers took to the Rock because they spied whales about it . But the Quaker in particular , debarred from battle and bloodshed , found in the war with the leviathan an outlet for energies inherited from Beowulf who killed the terrible beast of the marshes , and kinship to St. George who slew the dragon ; and in justification of this inconsistency could doubtless quote Isaiah , wherein he found : " In that day , the Lord with his sore , and great and strong sword , shall punish Leviathan the piercing serpent , even Leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea . " Then , prospering by the grace of God , having taken a dozen towns into the Pacific , the whalers felt impelled to bring back as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaii , not to mention the four hundred or more islands whose discovery lies to their credit .  | For years they had searched out every islet of those seas , pouring their hoardings of fat into the candle moulds of America , and turning tons of bone into straitjackets for the ladies . The insatiable demand for corsets and candles kept the whalers , as it kept Ahab , with hardly an hour at home . By 1819 they had almost exhausted every field and were lolling about Hawaii , where at least they could keep warm and taste of transplanted Puritan delights . While thus engaged , it chanced that Captain Winship , of Brighton , Massachusetts , looking in on his way home from Canton , announced that he had seen a school of sperm whales off the islands of Japan . As fast as their sails could be unfurled two whalers struck out for the Japan seas . The Syren and the Maro got there first and fell to slaughtering so vigorously that within three months both vessels were full to the hatches and floated back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese who , locked within their warm waters , defied the world to touch their sacred soil . In a little time the Japanese whaling grounds were buzzing with activity . In November of 1823 twenty-two whalers were in the harbour of Hawaii " which almost produced a famine . " Ten years later 1,200 ships and 30,000 men were employed in the Pacific whaling business and in the India and China trade , says Forbes . So plentiful had whale oil become that the ever larger and heavier ships built to bring the blubber home to Nantucket began to refuse to pass the bar . In a short time the whalers were compelled to land their caskets at New Bedford , across Buzzards Bay . The record of the whaleship Envoy will give some idea of the wealth in oil that lay floating around the proscribed waters of Japan . She was built in 1833 , 392 tons capacity , and sailed under Captain Clark to return on January 1 , 1838 , after an  | absence of four years , with 2,100 barrels of sperm oil worth $57,887 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200,000 , or $12,000 a year on an original investment of $35,000 . A certain Captain Walker then purchased her for $8,000 , and she sailed from New Bedford with a cargo of oil for Manila and thence to London , the profit of the voyage being $9,000 . So she went cruising again and in less than two months took 2,800 barrels of whale oil and bone . Of this haul Walker shipped 1,800 barrels of oil and 40,000 pounds of bone to London and realized a net profit of $37,500 . On a subsequent cruise she got 2,500 barrels of oil and 35,000 pounds of bone which she this time disposed of at San Francisco , in 1851 , for $86,000 . Returning to New Bedford she was sold for $6,000 , so that an investment of $8,000 netted Captain Walker $130,500 . This state of things continued in the whaling industry unabated for thirty years . The total value of the trade in 1835 was $6,000,000 ; in 1854 , it reached its peak at $10,802,594.20 . Between 1804 and 1876 the whalers were enriched to the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bedford drew to herself all the whaling skill of Nantucket , so that in 1857 she had a fleet of 329 vessels , valued at $12,000,000 and manned by 12,000 . Her entire whaling industry represented an investment of more than $70,000,000 and 70,000 persons derived their sustenance from it . One Negro , Lewis Temple , made his fortune turning out a new kind of harpoon which was so arranged that it sank very easily into the flesh of the whale , but turned at right angles to the shank and became permanently fixed in the carcass as the monster tugged in his fury . In New London , an old bachelor popularly referred to as Sebastian made more than ten million dollars in whaling , though his end of the industry was entirely the handling of the whalers ' cash . Of all the far-flung enterprises whaling was the most vital . In spite of the heavy losses it entailed as part of the ordinary hazards of the pursuit , it was not till the very elements joined in its destruction , abetted by the discovery of other fuels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the partial retribution  | wreaked upon them by infuriated whales , often the kindliest. fate ? these tales give only the less tragic accounts of the life of the whaler . The worst have doubtless never reached the ears of man . The last great flock of whaleships caught , in 1871 , in the ice floes of the Arctic and crushed within that frozen maw , wrecking thirty-five whaleships and endangering the lives of 1,200 men , women , and children , every one of whom was eventually saved ? that was the manner in which whaling made its exit from the stage of American life . And yet , of all these enterprises in the Pacific , none is more alive in the minds of men to this day than that of whaling . While one must storm the doors of proud mansions , once the homes of China merchants , for their secrets , the facts of the whaling exploit are visible at every corner of the old cities . " Captain said " is still a kind of incantation which overcomes all incredulity . In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build up a case against the elements ? musty , illegible , misspelled , and ungrammatical ledgers of the weather ? one sees crude drawings of whales in black ink . Each drawing records a catch . But nearly as many of these picture records show only the perpendicular tails of the leviathans , indicating thereby that the monsters sounded . Once , to offset such a disaster perhaps , the captain recorded : " To-night the old sow delivered 9 piggs . " He added a picture of the sow that looked more like a cow . . . . It was a hard , harsh , disappointing , lonely life , made more barren to us by the brevity of these jottings . But the whalemen were on the whole better off than other sailors , for their emotional lives had their roots in good homes . They were part of sober communities , not the outcasts of the deep , as so many common sailors were . Only a few cherished ruins remain to tell of whaling . During our stay in New Bedford we went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whaleships , which had been featured in the play , " Down to the Sea in Ships . " The glory of that final triumph was already gone , and she lay quite deserted , lashed to  | a lonely wharf , rotting at her keel . The same day the Wanderer returned , one of the few old-time whaleships still on the seas , The Wanderer set out for another trip , seeking the open seas once more , but she foundered within sight of her home port , just off Nantucket , and , as some said , Romance then gave up the ghost . And now Edgartown , Nantucket , Mystic ? all dream away their allotment of eternity , their white homes fresh with paint , their spacious interiors refurbished for a more fastidious generation . Gorgeous mansions top the hills from New Bedford to New London . " Nowhere in America , " wrote Herman Melville , even seventy-five years ago , " will you find more patricianlike houses ; parks and gardens more opulent than in New Bedford . Whence came they ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder mansion , and your question will be answered . Yes , all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic , , Pacific , and Indian oceans . One and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea . " The legends of whaling go on developing though the industry is dead , as a recent event has shown . On the fourth of July , 1918 , the little town of Fairhaven , Massachusetts , opposite New Bedford , was decked with a gaiety excessive even for war-time exuberance of feeling . Bunting linked corner grocery with church steeple , and garage with the public library , weaving a fabric of communal splendour that at once took in plutocrat and plebeian , republican and shintoist , until the contagion touched t he very ends of the earth . Patriotism wedded internationalism for the duration of the day , and predominant among the flags of the Allies hung the starry firmament of the American flag whose glittering was not in the least dimmed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other as in some new kind of cosmos of heavenly love . And what was it all about ? The Armistice was as yet unthought of ; the Fourth of  | July was referred to by only two out of the seven speakers ; the World War was set aside ? there was something more to the moment than all these . President Wilson thought the occasion important enough especially to exempt the Japanese Ambassador ? Viscount Ishii ? from attendance at the Mt . Vernon exercises he was himself conducting . After all , what could a representative of one of the oldest autocracies say on the birthday of a democ. racy ? Premier Terauchi had just hinted at a possible alliance between Germany , Russia , and Japan . Here was a chance openly to counteract that threat by the commemoration of a kind deed . So Ishii came up from Washington to New Bedford ; and , waiting for him at the Fairhaven end of the bridge to welcome him , stood one Calvin Coolidge , Lieutenant Governor of the State . Before the parade had halted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be held , those who were and those who were not descendants of whale men were living again mentally in the early part of last century during the height of the whaling enterprise in the waters of Japan . For in 1841 a Japanese boy named Manjiro Nakahama had gone fishing with a number of his townspeople in a smack that by governmental interdiction had been forbidden to go out of sight of the mainland . A storm arose and carried them far into the Pacific and flung them upon a rocky little island , the habitat only of sea-birds and turtles . Other men had been wrecked before , but if they were not sought they were at least pitied . These Japanese , according to the law of the land , could expect neither aid nor mercy from their rulers . Even if by great good fortune they were rescued , they could never hope to return to their native land , for death was the punishment meted out to any one who had stirred abroad . Moreover , since the prohibition had the effect of keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being picked up was thereby minimized . With only such prospects as these , the Japanese castaways survived for six months on birds ' eggs and turtle .  | Meanwhile , the Fairhaven whaleship John Howland was cruising about the whalefields , 20,000 miles away from home . For two years it had not been home . On the 27th of June , 1841 , Captain Whitfield " sent in two boats to see if there was any turtle " on a little island near Japan , and " found 5 poor distressed people " whom he took with him , though he " could not understand anything from them more than that they were hungry . " Ordinarily , he might have turned in the direction of Japan , where he of course knew they belonged , but he was well aware of the risk , for five years earlier the Morrison , bent upon a similar mission , had been fired upon and driven out . So he kept them with him during the next four months ' cruising , and put them ashore in Honolulu . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Whitfield took rather kindly to the boy Manjiro , who , for want of a simpler name , had been christened John Mung . Manjiro acted as cabin boy and showed unusual aptitude . When he begged to be taken along , the captain , who had sons of his own , yielded to the youth 's persuasion and brought him to America , where no Japanese had ever been seen . In the little village of Fairhaven , the diminutive stranger soon enjoyed all the prominence which his sallow skin and slit eyes gave him . Placed in school by the captain and apprenticed to the cooper 's craft , he entered into the social life of the town as a member of a respected family . He was bright , especially in mathematics and navigation , and took a keen interest in all the activities of the community . So six years went carelessly by . But the home hunger began to grow more keen . Manjiro was now a young man with little prospect of putting his knowledge to wider use . There was , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides whaling , let alone a Japanese . As a cooper he could earn his living , and , possibly , make his way back to his native land . So he secured a job on the Franklin and sailed again into the Pacific . Two years later , when the gold rush occurred , he shared in the fortunes of other diggers and laid aside a little cash . At last , in the tenth year of his  | exile , he had himself and three of his fellow-castaways lowered to the sea in a whaleboat off the Loo Choo Islands , and dropped out of American life . Another ten years went by . Japan was now accessible to the world , but no word came from Manjiro . The barriers had been broken down for those who wished to enter ; but to those who wished to leave there were still the same barrier habits of mind . Yet , during this second decade there remained in Fairhaven the natural curiosity ? " I wonder if he is alive . I wonder what he is doing now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little mystery . " MY HONORED FRIEND ? I am very happy to say that i had an opportunity to say to you a few lines . I am still living and hope you were the same blessing . i wish to meet you in this world once more . How happy we would be . Give my best respect to Mrs. and Miss Amelia Whitfield , i long to see them . Capt . you must not send your boys to the whaling business ; you must send them to Japan , i will take care of him or them if you will . Let me know before send and I will make the arrangement for it . " Now I will let you know how am i arrived to my Native Country . You know that i have been to the Gold Mine ; here stayed 4 month , average eight Dolls per day , beside expenses , from here i made my mind to get back and to see Dear Mother and also Shiped in one of the American Merchant men . In this vessel i arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damon and through his kindness bought a whale boat and put her into a Merchant-man . This vessel was going to Shanghai in China .

The Capt . of vessel he wish me to stay with him and to go to China , but i refused it , because i wanted to see Mother . The ' boat is ready for me to get in , myself , Dennovo &; Goyesman  | jump in to the boat , parted with ship at 4 P. M. After ten hours hard pull we arrived lee of Island and anchored until morning . I went on shore amongst the Loo Choose , but i can not understand their language , i have forgot all Japanese words . I stay here six months , under care of the King of Loo Choo , waiting for Japanese junk to come .

After all the things is properly regulated we were send to our residence . It was great joy to Mother and all the relation . i have stay with my Mother only 3 day and night the Emperor called me to Jedo . Now i became one emperian officer . At this time i am attached this vessel . " This war steamer were send by Emperor of Japan to the Compliment of the President of America . We went to San Francisco , California , and now homeward bound , at Sandwhich to touch Island to secure some coal and provition . I wish to send the letter from San Francisco but so many Japanese eyes i can't. i wrote this between passage from San Francisco to Island . Excuse me many mistakes . i can write better after our arrived Japan Jedo . " I wish for you to come to Japan , i will now lead my Dear Friend to my house , now the port opened to all the nations . I found our friend Samuel C. Damon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all . When get home I will write better acct . I will send to you sut of my clothe . It is not new , but only for remember me . " I remain your friend , One thing John Mung fails to tell in his letter . The omission was supplied by the Japanese Ambassador : " When the Perry Mission from the United States landed at Uraga in 1853 , Manjiro served as interpreter . No more suitable person could have been found in all Japan . Manjiro knew  | the American spirit and desires . Any blunder on his part might have resulted in an international disaster . As it was , the Perry Mission was a great success . " This statement is amplified with diplomatic locution . Perry barely mentions Manjiro , and as a matter of fact the negotiations were carried on through Dutch interpreters . Nor was it either likely or possible for disaster to occur , considering the circumstances of that visit , as we shall see in a later chapter . Nevertheless , in this instance , the Ambassador leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession are only too prone to ignore the subtle influences of ordinary men . And there is no need to doubt that the grateful account of Manjiro Nakahama , spread throughout that terrified land , went far toward allaying the apprehension of the black squadron which had so suddenly steamed into the quiet harbours of Japan . The succeeding years did not obliterate this gratitude , nor did the intercourse between the Nakahamas and the Whitfields slacken in friendliness . When in 1870 Nakahama came to America as one of a Japanese mission , he again visited his Fairhaven friends , and there are those still living who can recall his coming . His own success in his native land as a professor at the Imperial University of Tokyo , so largely due to this strange experience , never weakened his gratitude to the old captain . When Manjiro died gratitude was kept fresh by his children . His eldest son , Toichiro Nakahama , felt that he ought in. some way to perpetuate that regard . In a manner most typical to a Japanese he felt that a gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Captain Whitfield . It was this sword that Viscount Ishii had come to bring to Fairhaven . So now at the Millicent ( Rogers ) Library of Fairhaven there lies this sword , together with the quaint letter of Manjiro illustrated with Japanese drawings . And we can not do more than accept it in the spirit in which it was given , however much the world may vary in its regard for the material form which the symbol took .  | This naive record of affection and gratitude touched everyone who attended the presentation . The orators of the day , somewhat misjudging their own feelings , attempted to rise to some amplitude of oratory ; to discover in it some deep significance and grave international import . " We are met , " said Mr. Coolidge , in words whose intention is better than their rhetoric , " to assess the dimensions of a kind deed . " It remains for posterity to tell whether their judgment was as good as their intentions . Generations will reflect upon it as they see the sword there in the Library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about it . The story it tells is not history , though every word happens to be true . It is part of the imperishable stuff of folklore by which the popular imagination clings to the records of outward acts . " We are here , " said one of the speakers of the day , " because an American was kind and a Japanese remembered . " Across those differences which are said to divide the East from the West , many have been kind and many have remembered . This story by reason of a fortunate symmetry in its outlines and the articulate drama in its conclusion , stands , in the collective mind , as the type and symbol of them all .  | BETWEEN the lawless days of sandalwood and furs and the last grand fireworks of the clipper , gold rush , and opium era , there came a period of rampant speculation followed by greater concentration of power in the hands of great merchants like Stephen Girard of Philadelphia and John Jacob Astor . Though Far Eastern crews were still recruited from among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England , New York and Philadelphia became the real centres of the trade . Since the days when the Empress of China was financed by Robert Morris , Philadelphia had always occupied one of the most prominent positions in the whole trade . Phineas Bond , as we have seen , had believed that Philadelphia would be the only city in America that would rival London in the Indies . It was then , of course , only a fraction of its present size . It still lay upon the banks of the Delaware , and the best business quarters were right near the river . " The commerce of America in 1793 , " said Cooper in " The Crater , " " was already flourishing , and Philadelphia was then much the most important place in the country . Its East India trade , in particular , was very large and growing . " The prospects of the China trade stimulated men like Robert Morris and Benjamin Franklin to daring dreams of a political and social development for America wholly independent of Europe and patterned after China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression , Robert Morris suggested a similar self-sufficiency for America . " A mandarin signs a passport , " he remarked , " for all European ships directed to the commander of two of the Emperor 's forts on the river of Canton , nearly in the following words : Permit  | this barbarian boat to pass . She has  --  guns , and  - -  men , consequently can do the Emperor no harm . ' If the government of America could concentrate the force of the country in any one point where occasion required , I think our mandarins might grant similar passports to the rest of the world . " Upon which the biographer of Morris , Oberholzer , comments : " While Chinese civilization was a curious ideal for the learned men of the United States to hold before them , it was something of the glamour of unknown and curious places which attracted Morris to the East . " To such an extent were people then influenced by reports of China that the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia , over which Benjamin Franklin presided for the term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only " be so fortunate as to introduce the industry of the Chinese , their arts of living and improvements in husbandry as well as their native plants , America might in time become as populous as China , which is allowed to contain more inhabitants than any other country of the same extent in the world . " That glamour held innumerable others in its power . Cooper sends his hero on a quest for riches to the Pacific from Philadelphia . When the lad returns with " real India handkerchiefs hanging out of each pocket of a blue round-about of superfine cloth , besides one around his half-opened , well-formed throat , that was carelessly tied in a true sailor knot , " he is the envy of all the boys and the admiration of all the girls in town . And later , when the better parlours introduced hyson tea , the cataclysmic disturbance that resulted nearly wrecked the social life of the day , and those who had shipments of bohea tea might as well go into bankruptcy . Amidst all these aspirations and social revolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire enterprise , the personal embodiment of the trade . There were any number of others , Smith , Thompson , Jones , but Stephen Girard alone maintained his success , untarnished and undiminished . Thompson failed after wild speculations , as we shall see , and ended his days in prison ; Jones , the head of a tremendous East  | India-Canton mercantile establishment , finally became Secretary of the Navy in Madison 's administration . But Girard sought neither political preferment nor the gambler 's gloss , and so there is n't a name in Philadelphia that is more persistent than that of Stephen Girard , in spite of the zeal with which the fathers sought to obliterate every trace of him , as Abraham Ritter charges . A stranger , an alien , a Catholic by birth and a freethinker by conviction , constantly avoided and almost suspected by the " Friends " and Fathers , there was not a virtue they professed but he practised it , not a laurel they desired but he secured it . When in 1793 the yellow fever ravaged the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? took upon himself the terrible task of nursing the diseased , when friends , fathers , mothers , and children deserted them . For months he neglected business for mercy , and attended to his duties with divine indifference to consequences . Yet in the end , says his biographer , all he received was a resolution of thanks . " This resolution of thanks , once passed , neatly framed and delivered , the city of Philadelphia considered its duty in the premises wholly done . No friendly feeling toward the man , returning pale , thin , and worn , from the house of pestilence and death , prompted her citizens to publicly speak a kindly word for that self-devoted heroism that had just finished the task they dared not undertake . Nor was there afterward found in all her limits , one man courageous enough to devote his pen to Girard 's defence when , in later years , public gossips , self-styled biographers , joined the daily press in stigmatizing his honourable name . " Again , when , during the second war with England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fear of the war ending in failure because of the need of a few millions , Americans hesitated to subscribe to a government loan until Girard , upon the first approach , " staked his whole fortune on the failing arms of the country of his choice . " Yet he ,  | perhaps more than any other merchant , was losing by the war which crippled overseas commerce . Now and then the loss was spectacularly retrieved . An incident of that war gives in brief an idea of the range and magic of his enterprises . His ship , the Montesquieu , worth $20,000 , had been for two years in the Orient . On March 26 , 1813 , not knowing of the war , she approached the mouth of the Delaware with a boom of cannon like that with which Girard himself had greeted the city thirty-seven years before . Instead of a friendly pilot , however , there appeared a picayune vessel which took the armed Montesquieu captive and turned her over to a British man-of-war . Her cargo was worth $165,000 . Girard ransomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great demand for such goods on account of the war , sold them for $488,655 . Girard 's contacts knew no limits . His ships were everywhere , but mainly in the China trade . So invincible was his financial position that even to this day the authorities of the Port of Philadelphia have to admit that much of the city 's importance is due to him . " It has been said that the construction of great modern piers on the Delaware River , " says their leaflet , " just above Market Street has brought a partial realization of Stephen Girard 's vision of the city of Philadelphia as a world port . Girard 's cutters were initiative in promoting maritime trade , and a century ago the old wooden wharves just north of Market Street were noted chiefly as the place for the arrival and departure of the Girard ships then engaged in the Philadelphia-Bordeaux and Philadelphia-East Indian trade . The sturdy old wooden Girard wharves and the Clifford docks for a hundred or more years carried the brunt of the overseas trade . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down this avenue , particularly when it was obstructed by the overhanging jib-booms of the various sailing craft occupying the piers . " In the years that followed the war , Girard turned more fully to the China market for his exploits than ever before . His ships , the North America , Voltaire , Rousseau , Helvetius ,  | and Montesquieu , with hundreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of cargo and specie , made constant and regular voyages in the circuitous manner of the day ? to Southern ports for rice and cotton , to Europe , where they were disposed of for Spanish milled dollars , thence to Canton , Java , Batavia , Isle of France , for silks , spices , ebony wood , coffee , and sugar which were again carried to Europe , and again the ships were laden with Spanish milled dollars for Girard 's Bank , to offset the drain of specie from America which the other traders were compelled to ship to the China market and the India trade . To Girard , the banker , specie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported . He was head of the first private bank in the United States , yet he managed that as successfully as he had his other vast enterprises . His influence had by now grown world-wide . He was appealed to for assistance by all sorts and conditions of men ; and President Monroe asked him for a loan to offset the impending need of selling an estate . Prince Joseph Bonaparte gave him special permission , through the ministration of a friend of his in France , to bring the Rousseau into Antwerp direct from China . " I have had the honour of entertaining in my house Prince Joseph Bonaparte who made a short stay within our walls , " wrote this man . " I did not allow this opportunity to escape but approached him about the introduction into the port of Antwerp of your ship Rousseau from China . I have just received a letter from his Imperial Majesty granting the request . " When Girard died in 1831 he was worth $7,000,000 , and was one of three or four millionaires in America all of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Girard , unlike Astor , Peabody , and Derby , had no family . The tragedy of his private life from the time he left his father 's home at the age of fourteen to the unfortunate marriage with a woman who lost her mind and spent twenty-five years in a hospital , had turned his interests outwardly to public benefits . And while he toiled like a galley slave all those sixty-five years which netted him an incredible fortune , he determined to  | leave the greater part of it for the founding of a college for orphans and for the beautification of Philadelphia . His leanings toward the free thought of the age ? he was a follower of Voltaire and a friend of Jefferson and Thomas Paine ? made him determine to keep religious teaching out of this college so that , as he said in his will , the minds of the children will not be confused by denominational differences and ecclesiastical hair-splitting . To that end he declared in his will that not only should no religious doctrine be taught in the college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever to be permitted to cross its threshold ; a rule which is still in force . And so it was that one of the first philanthropic institutions in America was fathered by wealth gained from the Indies . In one of the " Twice-told Tales , " Hawthorne tells the story of a man who left a sum of money to endow an annual banquet of great splendour at which were to be feasted the twelve most miserable people in the world . Among the candidates is Stephen Girard , who lays down his millions of China gold in token of his misery . He was , indeed , never a merry figure , yet who shall say that there was less happiness than other men find in all the harshness and tenderness of that strange and solemn life ? With the death of Girard there was no outstanding personality to prevent the drift of trade from Philadelphia to New York which followed in the natural development of American commerce . For New York in 1830 was still almost wholly maritime in its atmosphere , with no great railroads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . " There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes , " says Herman Melville in " Moby Dick , " " belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs ? commerce surrounds it with her surf . . . . Look at the crowds of water-gazers there . . . Posted like silent sentinels all around the town , stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.  | Some leaning against spiles ; some seated upon the pier-heads ; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China . And there they stand ? miles of them ? leagues , Islanders all , they came from lanes and alleys , streets and avenues . Yet here they all unite . Tell me , does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all ships attract them thither ? " All through the War of 1812 and far into the ' 30 's , New York 's trade with China and the Far East was one of the most lucrative forms of revenue . So profitable was the trade with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built for himself a store so large that it was the wonder of the city , out of the returns on a single cargo of tea ; and this same merchant once drew a check for more than half a million dollars to pay the government duties . Another China merchant , Isaac Close , lent the Government half a million dollars in 1814 . Later on he needed a couple of hundred thousand himself in order to send out the Frances Henrietta to China , and approached the Bank of the Manhattan Company for a loan . Unwilling to drag in another endorser for his note , he swore that he was worth $750,000 and got the loan . But the greatest of all of them was Astor , of whom the reticent Stephen Girard of Philadelphia was constrained to remark that he had " passed through every stage of mercantile life , from small toy-seller to respectable fur dealer , then to the immense China merchant , cracking his half million cargoes of teas as you would a bale of goods . " The Government had realized the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to stimulate it permitted the merchants to bring in their cargoes without an immediate payment of duties . This afforded them so much leeway ? from six to eighteen months ? that they frequently were able to dispatch the same vessel two and three times to China for fresh freight before they were compelled to pay the duty on the first shipment . But they became indebted to the Government for thousands and even millions of dollars . Astor is said to have held more than $5,000,000 in this way , free of interest , for about twenty years , a more interesting story than the  | rumours of the origin of his fortunes in Captain Kidd 's treasure , which are still current . But Astor was always solvent and could take chances with a lax government . There were others tragically less so . Several merchants began to plunge heavily into the importation of tea . As with ginseng in China , so with tea in America ? the market was soon overstocked . By 1826 it was glutted . The Government became alarmed and attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading tea merchants , was unable to pay and a distraint was placed upon his goods . Driven to drastic means of raising money , he would pay the duty on a hundred chests , obtain a permit for their release , forge a further permit , and remove a thousand or five thousand packets . Realizing that if he sold such large quantities in Philadelphia he would arouse suspicion , he sent them to New York . He was soon found out and sent to jail , where he shortly afterward died , owing the Government vast sums of money . Smith of New York was another tea speculator . He and Astor had bought Thompson 's tea at a very low rate owing to the latter 's failure . Finding himself in a similar position , and being unable to bully the Collector of the Port of New York into remitting his obligations , he moved across to Perth Amboy , New Jersey , where he erected an enormous warehouse , intercepted his vessels as they returned from Canton , and conducted his vast enterprises from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stocks , succeeded , as part shareholder , in making for himself $150,000 , on which he very wisely retired . But in the end , Smith failed , owing the Government $3,000,000 by way of unpaid duties . The Government never collected , and the story of his fortune , which had passed on to his son-in-law , is replete with tragedy and chagrin . Smith &; Nicolls also failed , owing the Government $100,000 which was never collected . Astor alone was not caught in the trade lull . He had bought Thompson 's tea and had not yet paid for it when the failure came . By turning his cargoes to the Mediterranean he saved himself . Even Boston was af- fected , and Perkins withdrew entirely from the tea business . For five years the trade was dead . So uncertain had trade for a time become that there arose in New York a fraternity of young men who were called Prime Ministers , commercial guides , so to speak , who piloted strangers bent on business through the labyrinthian dangers of Gotham . Educated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncouth and boorish , they became the confidential advisers and the junior partners of the established merchants . Eventually , they became an unavoidable evil to their financial superiors , if the story is not exaggerated , and no establishment that wanted to get along could safely ignore their advice or refuse to employ them . One of these , Count Metternich , became the owner of a great fortune in this manner . Among the leading firms of the time were Jacob Barker , Archibald Gracie , N. L. &; G. Griswold , Talbot , Olyphant &; Co. , Grinnell , Minturn &; Co. , though from the very beginning individuals outside the commercial profession undertook to share in such adventures , as did Gouverneur Morris . The vogue for Chinese goods had tempted men to corrupt practices . Certain scalawags began to undermine the European market with Chinese imitations . The cost of Parisian luxuries having become exorbitant , a man of the name of Carnes conceived the idea of sending samples of these to China , there to be duplicated by the thousand , and then pouring these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Chinese ? fans , famous sauces , preserves , sweetmeats , syrups , silks , even attar of roses ? all were cleverly reproduced . Even Turkish rhubarb , which used to be imported neatly packed in tins , was imitated . The Chinese packed a yellowish wood that tasted like sumac , which , we are told , was no more harmful than sawdust , but which nevertheless resulted in several deaths among children . But the trick worked ; the profit was enormous , several hundred times the cost of real rhubarb , and sometimes as much as 1,000 per cent . Carnes soon possessed a vast fortune , but he overstocked the entire market . Quite unable to dispose of a great quantity of this  | counterfeit material he tried to dump it on the South American markets , but was unsuccessful . In the end he was forced to close with heavy losses . New York went through the chastening influence of plague , fire , war , and failure , none more ruinous than the embargo , and none more spectacular than the failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1837 to bring the city and its China merchants to a saner judgment , and to steer the merchant marine toward the clipper era . Though three-quarters of a century has gone by and the modern New York engages in enterprises larger and more exciting than anything then attempted , still the Oriental trade retains a peculiar hold upon the imagination . Even now , every day , hundreds of Wall Street 's busiest men leave their swivel chairs and mahogany desks , their telephones and tickers , their speculations in tape , and go over in shoals to India House for lunch . There they eat oysters and steak , sit in Windsor chairs made of fumed oak , are served by the usual waiter , and smoke the usual cigars . No Madeira wines ( at least not openly ) , no Hindu turbaned boys , no odour of myrrh and incense , no sinuous Oriental dancers ? nothing exotic whatever hangs about the place . Yet there is a waiting list of five hundred tired American business men ready to pay an entrance fee of $250 and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fifteen hundred Americans from every country in the world pay tribute to India House and draw vicarious rapture from its imperishable though forgotten exploits in the Far East . For India House represents a curious revival in our own time of a thing long thought dead . Its ancestor was the New York Marine Society , incorporated in London , which died in the Revolutionary War , only to spring into life again as a native as soon as New York had laws to protect it . Then it ceased to function for a century or so . For some years India House has been but an inscription over the door of an old and stately  | building in Hanover Square . In 1914 , an enthusiast in Far Eastern affairs , Willard Straight , gathered a number of merchants trading in the East , and formed the present institution . There seems to have been scant knowledge as to why the club should be called India House , Inc. , but soon the walls of the house were decked with pictures of clipper ships , of forgotten captains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose significance has been lost to many of those who treasured them ; and men with only their instincts to guide them rushed into the romantic fraternity of pirates , merchantskippers , and supercargoes of a hundred years ago . In this very year ( 1925 ) the British traders in Indian teas have inaugurated a movement to stimulate greater drinKing of tea in America to mitigate the alleged drought created by the Volstead Act . Originally the trade in rum with the West Indies furnished capital for the trade in tea with the East Indies . Will our bootleggers give way to a new generation of bizarre speculators in tea ?  | THERE is a legend in America that the Japanese are so dishonest that they themselves employ Chinese cashiers in their banks . That this is false need hardly be said ; but the way in which the story started is rather interesting . In the days before the Japanese let us into their land , the Chinese were already acquainted with their ways of doing business . The trade between Europe and China was also extensive . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and urbanity of the Chinese had won for them fame throughout Europe . Their reputation for morality was widespread . The great writers praised them without stint . Voltaire , though he admitted that " the commonality is as rascally as it is with us , that they haggle as much as we do , " nevertheless regarded the Chinese as a people of the greatest virtues . All Europe was enamoured of the character and civilization of the Chinese . When the Americans commenced going to China on their own , after the Revolution , they found not a little of this rascality . Young Boit , the mate of the first Boston ship to get to Canton , recorded that they were extremely shrewd and had to be watched very closely , and when caught in malpractice would say that in a voyage or two more the Americans would understand better this way of doing business in China and would not be taken in again . During the seventy years of trade t hat intervened between the first arrival of Americans in China and the opening of Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted nothing in the way of friendship and confidence and good will . And when the Americans , finding that their Chinese clerks were a ready avenue into Japanese business life , took them with them to Japan , their presence  | there gave vogue to the story that the Japanese could not be trusted . But legends do not live on lies . Behind each fable is a fact . And so the story of the integrity of the Chinese has remained unchallenged through the years . Had not the traders found their Chinese clerks responsible , they would not have carried them along with them to a stranger and more uncertain land . And it is the record of those three quarters of a century of intercourse with China , tested by the trials of smuggling , squeeze , war , and national weaknesses , that gave currency to the legend of Chinese reliability , perhaps one of the most unique stories in the annals of foreign trade . And from this contact there have emerged some characters that , though not of the category of soldiers , statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves of a better fame . For while the Peabodys and the Astors and the Girards of America were scanning the far horizon for the silks and the teas and the porcelains of China , there were the Houquas , the Mouquas , and the Kingquas of China , seeking ways and means of appeasing the hunger of the Occident for the wealth of the Orient , and allaying the ire and the contempt of their own haughty overlords for the simple traders at their ports . Out of these numerous Chinese merchants with whom the foreigners had to deal there stands one name which had become the symbol of integrity for all Chinese , and that name was Houqua . And as Houqua 's reputation spread throughout eastern America , this legend of extreme honesty of the Chinese spread , so that while none knows of Houqua , all know of the trustworthiness he had engendered into an unwanted and even illicit relationship between the East and the West . It was no easy task for these merchants to maintain their position . There was , in fact , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The foreigners felt themselves to be scorned peddlers who were unjustly discriminated against , and saw no reason to be fair . They had no confidence in the system devised by the Chinese Government for handling the traffic ? a system of monopolies placed in the hands of a dozen  | merchants known as hong merchants , and the petty Chinese merchants who wanted to deal with the foreigners but were prevented by this monopoly did little to raise their status . And so all round there was every reason for " bootlegging " and none for abstinence . It is all the more remarkable , then , that there should have appeared so attractive and responsible a figure in Canton as Houqua . Houqua , whose family name was Wu Tunyen , was born in the same year as Napoleon and Wellington ? in 1769 . He was of humble family , but that in the Chinese code was little against him . At that time , all Europe was engaged in the pleasant task of imitating China and weighing her virtues against their own shortcomings . When Houqua was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for business and for associating with the foreigners gained for him admission into that exclusive monopoly , the co-hong . Wherever he moved , he saw malpractices . Between the Chinese and the foreigners there obtained irritating relationships . The one who could adjust these growing difficulties would secure the leadership of the whole monopoly . Only a young man like Houqua could rise to the occasion ; for it needed not only financial ability , but tact and sagacity and refinement and a broader outlook on life . It was becoming obvious that unless these insistent " barbarians " from overseas were treated more equably there would be trouble , and Houqua , with fewer prejudices than all the rest , rose to the occasion . An American , writing home in the first days after the Revolution , said : " It is unfortunately the case here that there is no man to be relied upon but Houqua and he has too much business . " His name became a mark of genuineness and excellence that few traders could do without . American merchants offering teas and silks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these bore the name of Houqua . Houqua remained a household word in America for half a century , and when the first clipper ship was designed and constructed , it was called the Houqua , and a model of it was sent to this venerable merchant of Canton as a gift from his devoted friends in America .  | To understand more clearly the nature of the times we must digress a moment , long enough to examine the attitude of the Chinese Government and the structure of the monopoly it had erected as a barrier between itself and the world of white barbarians . From the very beginning of the trade between Europe and China , the Chinese realized that there existed such a wide gap between these two civilizations that ordinary intercourse was impossible . As superior as we are to-day to China in science and invention , so was China then superior to us in culture and industry . When , however , the Chinese found it difficult to drive off these traders , they decided to control them . To prevent complications and to centralize as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scheme of handing out monopolies for the trade to a limited number of Chinese . These became known as hong merchants , and never exceeded thirteen in number . Though they acted more or less as a united body , they were never incorporated , yet they were all mutually responsible for the obligations incurred by any one of these several merchants . If one failed to meet his debts , the rest were by law compelled to settle with the foreign creditor , and were all responsible for the misbehaviour of these undesirable aliens as well . The Government never troubled itself about tariff regulations , relying solely upon its implacable power of squeeze to exact from both the hongs and the foreigners all that the traffic could bear . And from 1720 on through 1840 , the system worked more or less to the mutual satisfaction of the three groups concerned . The hong merchants were the friends of the foreigners and were anxious that a commerce so lucrative should not be interfered with by the officials . Thus before the dignified humbug of the mandarins , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humorous entente . With the Chinese imperturbable command of temper and their ability to laugh heartily at foreign pleasantries the point of which they could not in the least understand , they managed to pass all foreign inelegancies as things to be  | taken for granted from these " sea people " who had been so restless and so foolish and so poor as to traverse wide wastes of water for the sake of trade . For trade the Chinese had little less than contempt at best . When we see how all Europe hailed the civilization of China as the finest the world had ever seen , the attitude of the Chinese to these crude Europeans does not seem entirely unreasonable . They brought no great magnificence , and as one great English scholar has recently observed , their gifts to the Emperor , standing now in the museum at Pekin , are tawdry beside the exquisite works of Chinese art . For mechanics , for whom even Thomas Jefferson had little respect , the Son of Heaven had no respect at all . In one of his numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire permits tea , rhubarb , etc. , to be sold to keep alive the people of the said nations . Those persons who are annually kept alive thereby are more than ten thousand times ten thousand . How substantial a favour is this ! " At another time he declared , with truth : " Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its own borders . There was therefore no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce . . . . I do not forget the lonely remoteness of your island , cut off from the world by intervening wastes of the sea , nor do I overlook your excusable ignorance of the usages of our Celestial Empire . Tremblingly obey and show no negligence . " Englishmen and Dutchmen and French had come away from China , to try , later , to imitate in various ways the landscape gardens and porcelains they had seen . But there was little effort on the part of the few Chinese who deigned to go abroad to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a happy and contented people . A letter by one Chinese reveals the impression the Occident had made on his country . " I felicitate myself , " says the writer , " that I was born in China , and constantly think how very different it would be with me , if I had been born beyond the seas in some remote part of the earth , where the people , far removed from the  | converting maxims of the ancient kings , and ignorant of the domestic relations , are clothed with the leaves of plants , eat wood , dwell in the wilderness , and live in the holes of the earth ; though born in this world , in such a condition I should not have been different from the beasts of the fields . But now , happily , I have been born in the Middle Kingdom . I have a house to live in ; have food and drink ; and elegant furniture ; have clothing and caps , and infinite blessings : truly , the highest felicity is mine . " Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade relations with the West , but the impression the Europeans made on them was not improved . They continued to keep them at a distance , compelling them to live by themselves on a promontory overlooking the sea , some sixty miles away from the city of Canton , which they called Macao . As at our Provincetown , so at Macao , the Portuguese kept pretty much aloof , but being close to China they were able to tap that rich reservoir sufficiently to make of the spot an idyllic little settlement . With its narrow , winding streets , paved with smooth flat stones , and palatial houses high upon the hills , it struck all Occidental visitors as a sample of paradise . This mossy old town , harbour of the Goddess A-Ma , situated on a peninsula three hundred feet above the water , frequented by hurricanes but tempered by cool southwest breezes , had become the great emporium for all European commerce in eastern Asia . Commanded by some ineffectual forts , it was likewise provided with thirteen large Catholic churches of a highly ornamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its many charming vices . It had quite a Western air about it , with senate house , court house , prison , hospitals of stone and brick , and homes all white and shining and commodious . Here all white men lived a life of semi-feudal splendour , in palatial houses surrounded by large gardens where the white Chinese lilies and old rose bushes , brought there in the middle of the 16th Century from Portugal , grew in a tangle amidst the fountains and small tea houses . Thither all foreigners went for rest and recreation . There and there alone they maintained some -  | thing of the culture of Europe enhanced by the riches of Asia . But splendid though it may have been , it could not hold a candle to the luxurious living of the Chinese ; and these saw nothing at Macao they could imitate . For nearly a century before the Americans arrived in Canton , the British were beginning to encroach upon and dominate the trade with China , and in the course of time foreign factories were established close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proceed up the Pearl River to Whampao , the anchorage at which they stopped , were taken in charge by the hong merchants to whom they were consigned and the process of unloading and reloading began . While all this was going on the captains and the supercargoes of the vessels had little to do but pass from one entertainment to another given in their honour . The sailors remained on their vessels , enjoying only occasional jaunts to Canton , but indulging in all the vices that had gathered about Whampao . And so , affecting to disdain the trade , though enjoying quite keenly the enormous sums of squeeze they obtained , the Government at Pekin left all the worries and complications to the hong merchants . These had their separate establishments , or hongs , in Canton , with great armies of writers , interpreters , book-keepers , coolies , and hangers-on . Besides their private hongs , they maintained at the north end of China Street a public hall for all the Chinese merchants , called by the foreigners the Consoo House . This was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which all the public business of the co-hong was conducted , and where , on occasion , foreigners were tried in an improvised court . Adjacent to the Consoo House was Factory Street , in Chinese Shih-san-heae , or Thirteen Factory Street , so called for the thirteen foreign factories ( warehouses ) to which it was parallel . Factory Street was the longest straight street in Canton , and foreigners who slipped clandestinely into the city used it as a compass to guide them out of that teeming labyrinth . Within the grounds and within the walls of their factories all white men were voluntary prisoners ? voluntary only in that  | they could at will return to Macao or their native lands . To the officials , from the Viceroy to the Son of Heaven himself , they were non est so long as they sought no new privileges or further entree into the Celestial Realms . For that precautionary purpose there were the hongs , an inaccessible barrier between them and greater China . And whichever way the storms came , it was this merchant barrier that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain a Consoo fund , as it was called , a sort of sinking fund , out of which all demands , either from the Government at Pekin or from foreigners , could be met . They were not permitted to go into debt to foreigners , but they did , else they could hardly have carried on business . During the American Revolution , several of these hong merchants owed British merchants some four million dollars , to force payment of which Great Britain dispatched a frigate from India to Canton . And all the merchants jointly were compelled by Pekin to meet this and subsequent obligations . By the time the Americans arrived , Houqua was already the senior hong merchant , and as such he bore not alone the advantages of his position , but most of its disadvantages . Whatever excesses the other hong merchants permitted themselves , whatever their failures , his laborious integrity stood the test of half a century of seniority over the group . Time and again he would gladly have laid aside his labours with their incessant trials if the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief conditions was that once a hong merchant , always a hong merchant . There was no withdrawing from business . Only failure , disgrace , and banishment were the way out . His wealth and power grew day by day , and as the weight of his business increased , his face became more cadaverous , and his eyes more melancholy , albeit more wise , his manner more serious and resigned . But his reputation never altered . We see him moving in and out of every affair at Canton between Chinese officials and foreigners , shrewd , impersonal , serene .  | Tradition records that he cracked but one joke in his life , and that a mild pun . When the British threatened to proceed to Pekin and beard the invisible Emperor on his own ground , Houqua said blandly : " Suppose English man he go to Pekin , Emperor go to Shan Si cha' n't see . " One of the most difficult of his gratuitous advantages of being the senior hong merchant was that of looking after the foreigners . He was responsible not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual foreigners , but in large measure for the personal and social activities of all concerned . The pranks and caprices of the white men were by him to be kept down . In matters of trade , the foreigners realized , of course , that they were safer in the hands of the hongs than in trying to deal with irresponsible merchants . But in personal affairs , they naturally chafed under the restraint which kept them virtually prisoners in their factories . Yet so wide did the Celestial Empire feel the gap between these opposing civilizations , that the Government was much more severe in these personal restrictions than it was even in the matter of trade . It raised an impassable bar to foreign intercourse with the Chinese . One of the most annoying of these prohibitions was against bringing white women to Canton . Considering the liberties the Chinese permitted themselves in the matter of wives , there seems something peculiarly ironical and satanic in this interdiction . Men with wives were certain to be more sober than men without , but the Chinese knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ever care to go , and they hoped by this denial to force them to leave . But they gave another reason . Tinqua , one of the hong merchants , explained that the Chinese would be too curious about white women , and in fact , whenever a white woman did smuggle herself in , Chinese paid " three cash " to satisfy their curiosity . Then , too , there was the difficulty of protecting the women against insult . Nevertheless , every now and then some defiant Briton would boldly assail the impregnability of this regulation ; women would appear , dressed in men 's clothes , and roam the streets of Canton . So long as possible , the officials would  | " shutty eye and shutty ear , " but in the end Houqua would have to remonstrate with the guilty foreigners , and the ladies would have to leave without a cure for their curiosity , or satisfaction to the men for their pains . This bar against white women was maintained until after the opium war in 1840 . It was not entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the artist , Chinnery , so well illustrates . The tale has it that Chinnery had run away from his debts and his wife in Calcutta and went into hiding at Canton every time a ship touched port , lest he might get word of one or the other . His antics furnished conversation and jokes for a decade . Chinnery was very popular . Sitting on one or another of the balconies overlooking the Pearl River of an evening , his great shaggy head shrouded in cigar smoke , he would describe by the hour the sins of Mrs. Chinnery to a convulsed audience . The sins grew and magnified as the months rolled on and the lady herself did not appear , till they assumed mythical and heroic proportions and became symbolic of the harsh Occidental life which these men had left behind for the lax gaiety and splendour of the East . For , with all their restrictions , the men enjoyed their exile blissfully enough , particularly the Americans , who were for the most part bachelors possessing no " she foreign devils " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into the sacred presence of the Chinese at Canton . " I 'm not surprised at your partiality for Canton , " wrote William Sturgis , the Boston merchant , reminiscently to Cushing who lived the life of a recluse in the factories for twenty-five years . In sharp contrast to the splendour of the palaces of the Chinese mandarins was the huddling regularity of the foreign factories , seeking , as it were , with all their might , to keep from falling into the Pearl River . This humble exterior , however , belied the magnificence within . Bachelor apartments though they were , above the storage rooms , they were punctiliously managed by corps of Chinese servants , furnished , as Eastern homes still are , with some furniture from home , supplemented by thick Chinese rugs , carved ebony  | tables and chairs , and great porcelain bowls , ivory screens , embroidered panels , and lacquer ware . There good whisky and champagne flowed freely as water ? more freely , in fact , than good water ? and when Frederick Tudor 's ships began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even the miraculous sound of ice all day clinking in the glasses , and now and then among the papaws and mangoes and small tangerine oranges lay a red Baldwin apple . Business was dispatched in sporadic whirls of activity , interspersed with long dinners in honour of everybody ? captains , supercargoes , the hong merchants , and such " strangers of respectability " as happened to arrive in port . To lighten their exile , they did manage to slip in a little outing now and then . On New Year 's Day they might be permitted to have a dinner party at Hwa To , a park called the " Flowery Land " just within the mouth of a branch of the Pearl River . Chinese would be on parade , in family parties , all arrayed in the richest silks of plum colour and jade , embroidered with birds and flowers , from neck to hem . The foreigners would arrive in gorgeous flower boats of their own , bringing food , wine , servants , and all the appurtenances of an elaborate dinner , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dragon Whose columns , like sages of yore , Speak words of the haziest wisdom , To feed , chat , smoke , and to snore . One understands why they snored when one reads the menu of such a dinner : " Birds ' - nest soup ; shad with hen's-egg sauce ; mutton ; fat capon with oyster sauce ; curried oysters ; fly gooso ' ( wild duck ; tame duck being sit down gooso ' ) chutney from Lucknow ; oranges and dates ( contributed as New Year 's presents by the hong merchants ) ; Cheshire cheese ; ale ; madeira wine ; etc. , etc . " But even in more quiet times the men did not suffer for want of pageantry in life . The Pearl River was a never-ending scene of entertainment . Stately mandarin boats with lanterns swinging and flags flying , flower boats , with all their filigree  | carving , and a sound of music all day long floating back amidst the uproar , like unfinished melody made with tinkling glass accompanied by the occasional banging of tin pans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with varnished sides and spacious cabins , bringing down the tea that was to load some American brig ; or great sea-going junks moving out among the canal boats , setting forth for Luzon and Java and the Malay Peninsula , as they had been doing from the very dawn of history . Seeing which , the foreigners thought to exhibit their own aquatic skill and organized a regatta club of their own . But the ever-vigilant Houqua , prodded on by the officials , reprimanded them for their temerity as follows : " On the river boats are mysteriously abundant ; everywhere they congregate in vast numbers ; like a stream they advance and retire unceasingly . Thus the chances of contact are many ; so are accidents even to the breaking of one another 's boats , to the injury of men 's bodies , while more serious consequences might ensue ! " ( Signed ) " HouQuA , MOUQUA , PWANKEIQUA . " This was the official version . Unofficially , genial Houqua urged " More better no go . " But the foreigners would not be restrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well so far as the captains , supercargoes , and merchants went , for at the worst they made only an illicit journey into the jungles of Cantonese life . But the source of most of the trouble that kept Houqua and his co-hong on the go was the sailors who in drunken orgies would " clean up " the town . Trouble between them and the Chinese , though by no means excessive , was frequent . In 1821 , the American ship Emily was in port . While she was at anchor some Chinese were gathered round her in their boats , and , it was alleged , a sailor on board of the name of Terranova dropped a jar upon the head of a woman , and she was seen to fall over into the river , from which she was removed dead . The mandarins immediately demanded  | that Terranova be surrendered to them , and Houqua was sent on board to make the negotiations with the captain . He promised that Terranova would be returned after a fair trial ; but instead , the mandarins put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never proved that he had even been seen to drop the jar , nor that he was actually guilty , and he was strangled in the Chinese fashion . Houqua 's word had been utterly ignored by the officials . They had merely used him as a catspaw to achieve their own ends . Such was the status of the hong merchants in the eyes of the officials . Just a few years earlier the viceroy had had some difficulties with a foreign vessel and could obtain no satisfaction . To vent his spleen , he commanded Houqua to raise a fortress on the main branch of the river , ostensibly to prevent such complications in future . Houqua obeyed , and for some time there stood this fort , built of granite but injudiciously constructed and placed upon an insecure foundation . On another occasion , after trouble with the governor which resulted in the burning of a factory , the foreign merchant had , when rebuilding , put in a garden and a quay . The governor ordered these to be removed at once and threatened Houqua with pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained on his knees before the governor till the hoppo , the collector of customs , interceded on his behalf . It was Houqua , always Houqua , who because of his wealth and his position as the senior merchant bore the brunt of all complications , even when wholly innocent . An affray had once occurred between a British crew and some Chinese in the course of which two Chinese lost their lives . The brother of one of the dead Chinese demanded a life for a life , but , afraid to accuse the governor of negligence of duty , he went all the way to Pekin to report his case and there put the blame on Houqua . The authorities told him to go back to Canton , giving him an order to the governor to investigate . The governor , of course , found the accusations false . Now , according to Chinese law , a false accusation is punishable as only one degree less criminal than the commission of a crime . If the governor  | had found Houqua guilty he would have been banished 3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to law , be banished one degree less , or 2,000 li . But inasmuch as the accuser had already made a long pilgrimage to Pekin and back in the execution of so meritorious a mission , he was pardoned , and permitted to go free . Had there been a more complicated situation , there is no doubt but that the governor would have let Houqua pay the penalty for his prominence . All of the hong merchants were bled in one way or another , but they accepted their tribulations with fatalistic indifference . They were constantly being haled before the mandarin court . Once when Fanqua , a lesser merchant , was being examined by a full court of mandarins with two secretaries taking notes , Mouqua , the dandy of the co-hong and second to Houqua , stood near him , laughing quietly up his sleeve , murmuring in English , which the mandarins could not understand , " Alle same sing song , " which meant " Quite a farce . " Notwithstanding the difficulties that hampered the relations of the hong merchants with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridged the artificial gap the mandarins sought to keep wide and impassable . The foreigners were frequently entertained very elaborately at the residence of this or that hong merchant , which afforded them a sight of splendour that no American , and very few Europeans , could expect at the time in their homelands . The houses occupied by a few of the more opulent in Canton were immense . Edmund Roberts , our first ambassador to the East , tells us in his " Embassy to the Eastern Courts , " that they were " by no means inferior to the imperial palaces . " Great gardens elaborately and curiously designed , with grottoes and lakes , crossed by carved stone bridges , and pathways that were inlaid with stones representing birds , fish , and flowers , afforded never-waning pleasure to the invited foreign guests . " The seat of the late Consequa , now half in ruins , was once superb ; that of Houqua  | is on a scale of great magnificence ; it is a village or rather palace , divided into suites of apartments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built above the roofs , and when surrounded by a breastwork , afford in the cool of the day a very pleasant and secure retreat , to which the inmates can ascend , in order to breathe a pure air , enjoy a wider prospect , or to witness any event that transpires in the neighbourhood . " The Chinese domestic unit being the clan rather than the individual family , it was incumbent upon the wealthy Chinese to maintain establishments that were more in the nature of villages or groups of villas than houses . These usually covered several acres of ground and were surrounded by brick or stone walls twelve feet high and rested on granite foundations . The courtyards were paved with polished granite blocks and set with exotic plants and shrubs . There the foreigners would promenade with their masculine hosts , catching only occasional glimpses of the women , wives , and dependents of the merchants . There were always several wives . Tinqua had five , and classified them according to their looks and the manner of their coming into his possession . No. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been chosen for him by his parents , and was " too much ugly . " He preferred No. 2 . As to the rest , they were mere incidents in a matrimonial existence . They shared in the general luxury of the proprietor , dressed in violet , scarlet , plum colour , or blue ; and , even in the eyes of the foreigners , were frequently " quite handsome , with lustrous eyes and small feet of a natural size . " To maintain such establishments proved a drain on some of the most opulent , and one hong merchant admitted that his family cost him $200,000 a year for up-keep . In the midst of such suave and luxurious life , manners and morals developed which could not but furnish the stuff romance is made of . While the hong merchants were compelled to be rigorous in the outward sense , personally they softened every possible rebuke with a kindness and a leniency not too usual in business . No official could possibly prevent a merchant from entertaining whomever he chose in his own home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation about foreign  | women , or were compelled to banish an intractable foreigner to Macao . And on their part , the foreigners notwithstanding the occasional spree at some merchant 's palace where they caught a fleeting glimpse of a beautiful Chinese lady , resented but did not regret the banishment . For their arts at entertaining themselves within their factories were taxed to the limit . To more than one sober son of the Puritans , life seemed godless enough , with Sundays devoted to poker , and dinner ending with drinking far into the night , with toasts for the bright eyes in Macao , and the conversation circling endlessly about some other man 's wife , with whom it was quite proper for these exiled bachelors to appear to be eternally in love . This question of women was naturally a vital one , and men in this or that station at Canton or on the remotest islands asked about such-and-such man 's luck with the reigning lady at Macao , and the success of the Chinese in trying to herd the white man out of Canton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current feminine population at that Portuguese settlement . And so between their factories at Canton and their residences at Macao all foreigners migrated , glad to escape the entanglements of domesticity or the strictures of the will of Heaven , with equal and alternate zeal . In spite of all these irritating prohibitions there obtained , between the hong merchants and the foreigners , great friendships and generous dealing . One looks for imposition and deceit where the power is entirely in the hands of the native merchant , backed by an implacable government ; but instead there remain records of generosity and gratitude , dramatic and delightful in the extreme . Some cases are almost incredible . There was , for instance , the case of the American trader ( whom we shall call Williams ) who thought to abscond from Canton without meeting a financial obligation . The young officer of the ship the American was sailing on persuaded him to satisfy his Chinese creditor . This got back to the hong merchant , who at once bought the officer 's little stock which he was permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more favourable price than any one else would have offered . Thereafter , for many  | voyages , the merchant always bought the officer 's cargoes at a better price . Some years later , the Chinese asked the American why he was not yet in command of a vessel of his own , and was told that the expense was more than he could bear , whereupon the hong merchant said he could easily remove that difficulty and gave him a draft for the requisite amount . It is said that he had even greater plans for rewarding the simple act of honour , but the young officer died at sea before he could carry them out . Such friendships were numerous . A British merchant at Canton failed . Chinqua , the hong merchant with whom he had had considerable dealings , offered to lend him $10,000 with which to begin again . The Englishman accepted and wrote out a note for the amount , which Chinqua at once threw into the fire , saying , with that casualness so typical of the Chinese : " When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was poor , and you took me by the hand ; and assisting my honest endeavour , made me rich . Our destiny is now reversed , and I see you poor , while I am blessed with affluence . " Moved by this generosity , the merchant insisted on giving Chinqua some token , and offered his watch , whereupon Chinqua gave him an iron seal in turn , adding : " Take this seal . It is one I have long used , but possesses no intrinsic value . But as you are going to India to look after your concerns , should fortune further persecute you , draw upon me for any sum of money you may need , sign it with your own hand and seal it with this signet , and I will pay the money . " The hong merchants knew only too well how easy it was to rise and fall in business as it was then conducted , and developed their own standards of morality and integrity . They were rich and poor with equal ease . But one among them stood like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houqua maintained a remarkable hold upon the minds of the Americans by his invariable graciousness in all circumstances , and confidence in him was never shaken . In all his dealings with Russel &; Company , and Perkins of Boston , written agreements were unknown . Mr. Russell Sturgis , of Baring Brothers , London , who had been for years in Canton , claimed that the  | only document of any kind he ever had from Houqua was a slip of paper four inches long and three quarters of an inch wide , upon which was written laconically : " Forty thousand dollars , Houqua . " Yet , when one of his compradores embezzled some $50,000 of the account with Russel &; Company , Houqua , who might easily have disclaimed the debt as there were no written records , at once sent the entire sum to his debtors . Houqua even went farther than meeting an intangible debt . An American friend of his was in financial straits and would have returned to America but for some notes for $100,000 which he owed Houqua . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hear you want to go back . I shall be sorry to lose you , but here are your notes cancelled , and I hope you will have good health and good luck in America . " One understands how the legend of Chinese honesty arose in the light of such generosity . Generosity is easy where wealth comes easy , though the two do not very frequently go together . The hong merchants earned their money easily enough , and yet there was no enterprise hedged in by so much uncertainty , " squeeze , " and duplicity as theirs . They had to be shrewd and grasping in order to offset some of the innumerable exactions that fell heavily upon them at every turn . It was no simple matter to become a hong merchant ; and costly as it was to enter the co-hong , it was impossible to withdraw . If a vacancy occurred by death or failure , an applicant for the place usually had to pay about $20,000 to the hoppo , the collector of customs ; several thousands . to writers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; several thousands more to the governor general as a means of securing his good will ; a thousand or so each to magistrates to guarantee justice in case of legal action ? altogether more than $42,000 just for the privilege of undertaking business with the foreigners . Once in 1832 , a new merchant , anticipating a great fortune in the business , named his hong " Happiness , or Prosperity Complete , " but by the time he paid all the fees and bribes  | he had nothing with which to carry on his business and went into bankruptcy . Such failures were numerous . In 1828-29 , two hongs failed with more than two million dollars indebtedness , and just before the opium war , ten years later , one hong failed with a debt of $5,000,000 . To guard against such contingencies , the Government , as has been mentioned , established the Consoo fund , making all the hongs jointly responsible for individual failures . But failure and bankruptcy were no escape for the unfortunate merchant . In such an eventuality the victim was banished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seldom returned alive . To an embittered merchant , even banishment sometimes seemed better . Fatqua , anticipating bankruptcy because of a debt of more than 300,000 taels which he could not meet , stopped business . In order to save some of his fortune he asked that he and his six wives and eleven daughters be banished , hoping that in time he might be able to return . But the officials refused to banish him and compelled him to remain in the harness . He did . Gowqua 's and Punjoyqua 's hongs also closed for a while , but were compelled to resume business . Such circumstances were bound to bring odium down upon the name of many a merchant . When Mouqua died , though he had been a dandy in his day , dressed in different shades of blue , with a cap , blue in front , scarlet crown , and blue glass button on top , and was a favourite with the foreign ladies because he helped them to smuggle themselves into Canton , the papers recorded of him : " From all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one universal expression of joy , that he is taken away . " Still , with a government battening upon them , with all trade illicit , and with much smuggling , the wonder is that there was as much honesty and fair dealing as is universally admitted . It was the policy of the Government to " rule the barbarians by misrule , " and the easiest way was by bleeding the hongs . The rule by misrule was carrying China headlong into collision with the foreign Powers , and all that was needed to precipitate conflict was a simple pretext . The British found it in opium .  | With the exception of one or at most two American firms , all foreigners were engaged in smuggling opium . It seems to have troubled the puritanical conscience very little , so far as the American merchants went , whether they doped the Chinese with opium and appeased their gods with sandalwood or not . This inconsistency did not miss the notice of the Son of Heaven in Pekin . " The foreign merchants , though they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization , yet are all provided with innate consciousness of good , " he admitted in an edict . But , he exclaimed , " What perversity can exceed this mad and absurd barking ! " against the interdiction of opium smuggling that went up from the pious traders . Unable to bear it any longer , Pekin sent down to Canton Commissioner Lin , a conscientious gentleman who sincerely tried to stamp out the traffic . On March 23 , 1839 , of a Saturday morning , he and the Prefect of Canton proceeded at an early hour to the Consoo House . Houqua and Mouqua were already there , stripped of their official buttons , and with small chains around their necks . Lin immediately dispatched them both to the house of Mr. Dent , a British merchant known to have engaged heavily in opium , with the command that said gentleman report at once to the Consoo House . Unless he appeared , they were instructed to say , two of the hong merchants would be at once put to death . As an earnest of these intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son into prison . When these two emissaries of " misrule " arrived at the foreign factories and announced their purpose , the foreigners held a prolonged conference and decided not to permit Mr. Dent to go to the Consoo House , where they feared for his life . The Americans decided to yield , guaranteeing not to handle opium . Anti-British feeling was rising . To protect the American women who had secretly come in , Minqua , a hong merchant , sent closed chairs to the factory and had them carried to his own house . From Minqua 's terrace they were able to look across to the factories , where presently smoke was seen to rise and flames burst from the British section . For a moment  | the skylight of one of the houses and the chapel belfry glittered in the light ? and then the whole sank in the flames . But Houqua 's difficulties were not yet at an end . " Chin chin my old and worthy friend Houqua for me , " wrote Thomas Handasyd Perkins to his agent , R. B. Forbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have frequently , in looking at his portrait , regretted the troubles and perplexities in which his duties have involved him . God bless you . " In a letter to Forbes , Perkins had , of course , no need of adding that his own traffic in opium was partly responsible for Houqua 's predicament , for Forbes himself afterward confessed to have made a fortune in the same way . Nor need one lose any tears over Houqua either , for that matter . Previous to the outbreak of the war , and for six weeks from the time of Commissioner Lin 's descent upon Canton , the foreigners had been kept prisoner within their warehouses until every ounce of opium in their possession was surrendered . All these helpless bachelors , living their gay and luxurious lives with innumerable servants in lieu of wives , were now virtually crippled by the withdrawal of all Chinese , of whatever station , in accordance with the order of Lin . The Parsees lent them their servants for certain tasks , but for six weeks they were compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status of leather , if R. B. Forbes is to be relied upon . Mainly , however , it was their pride that was affected . The American consul , Mr. Snow , felt the insult to his office more than did the merchants to their wealth . " Is this not too bad , Mr. Forbes , " he wailed , " that a public official at my time of life , not owning a pound of opium , should be imprisoned and compelled to do chambermaid 's work ? " At last Captain Eliot surrendered some million dollars ' worth of opium , withdrew from Canton , and the bombardment of the city followed . Then Canton was held for a six-million-dollar ransom . The Government turned in all directions for the wherewithal to pay . Of course , it turned first to the hong merchants , and made them pay a third of it . Inasmuch as Houqua was the senior and the most wealthy , more than half of  | this third fell to his lot . But he was not going to pay without some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might as well propitiate the gods at the same time , so he placed all the responsibility for his troubles on Fung Shuy ( Wind and Water ) ? invisible agencies that must not be ignored . Accordingly he put down $800,000 as a token of gratitude for his own prosperity ; then he added $200,000 for the filial piety of his oldest son ; and then , $100,000 for the youngest son , who was born to him in his sixtieth year . Adding just another touch of wisdom , he paid the whole fine in advance in order to avail himself of a discount of a thousand dollars by way of interest . With the defeat of the Chinese came the extinction of the co-hong system . The Government was compelled to abolish this monopoly by treaty , but in the manner of ancient statecraft they afterward tried to exact another squeeze of $5,000,000 which the merchants were of course unable and unwilling to pay . So they jointly paid off a debt of about a million due the foreigners individually , took down their lanterns from over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression had won . But with their victory came their defeat , for with the loss of the co-bongs the foreigners lost most of the security which had until then been assured them . Risk of sales , fraud in packing , difficulty in collecting from irresponsible merchants began to offset such immediate advantages as they had gained by the treaty . A new morality , a new code , a new method had to be worked out . Throughout the published and unpublished letters of American merchants and missionaries in China there is constant reference to " my dear friend Houqua . " During the War of 1812 , when American trade was interrupted , Houqua made several notes for thousands of dollars payable to Perkins of Boston ( January 28 , 1814 , and November 16 , 1814 ) while Perkins wrote to Houqua ( April 25 , 1815 ) advising him that the Port of Canton was closely blockaded and voyages were hazardous " during the destroying war which we have been subjected  | to by the folly of our government . " In another letter ( November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of specie in the country and declares that " New England is in a better position financially because it failed to lend money to the Government . " This friendly confidential relationship existed between men who had never seen each other and were separated by twenty thousand miles of sea . It existed in the face of smuggling , " squeeze , " and though protected neither by treaty nor the sentiment of the Chinese or American governments . It endured without a break during the twenty-five years that J. P. Cushing remained in business in China , and when he left on April 22 , 1828 , he wrote Houqua a warm personal letter of farewell . After the opium war things were changed . Foreigners felt freer and missionary activities branched out . Dr. Peter Parker , the American missionary , returned from a visit home to open his hospital . He approached Houqua for the use of one of his unoccupied buildings . Houqua demurred at first . He was getting old , and did not wish to incur any further difficulties such as had occurred there before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Nanhai hien , looking askance at the foreign practices , had held a coroner 's inquest over the body and had of course put the blame indirectly on Houqua for permitting such magic on his premises . But now , when Doctor Parker assured Houqua that he would take due precautions against any such thing happening again , he mollified the patriarch . Having succeeded so far , Parker asked what rent Houqua would charge . Houqua replied that it would be unnecessary to speak of that . " My own heart likes this business , too ; if any repairs are necessary , just call my compradore , and he will see that they are attended to . " Doctor Parker then assured him that his generosity would be known in the West , where of course his reputation was well established . But Houqua gazed absent-mindedly before him . He was suffering from pruritus , and inquired of his physician how long he might expect to live . He was told encourag- ingly that he was good for another ten years . He said three would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his affairs . He had twice before ? many years ago ? tried to buy himself off and retire , but in vain . Further oppression by the Government brought a sudden change for the worse , and this remarkable old man departed on a long journey to his ancestors , from Honan , on September 4 , 1843 , in the seventy-fourth year of his life . Despite the heavy drain upon his treasury , he had been reputed to have possessed , as far back as 1830 ( when Stephen Girard of Philadelphia was worth $7,000,000 ) , $26,000,000 . Doubtless at the time of his death his fortune was much greater , and some said it had gone up into the fiftymillion . Like Girard , he had spent more than fifty years at this incessant labour . Like Girard , he was a generous and yet solemn man . Richer by far than Crcesus and as rich as John Jacob Astor , he made an interesting addition to the great merchants of the time . Here , then , lay the greatest heap of the Gold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went much of the charm and delight of the Far Eastern commerce . Other ports were opened and everybody rushed into the traffic . The clipper ships cut down much of the distance and the uncertainty , and the steamer did the rest . The taboo on women was removed . " Individual expenses greatly increased , houses and social arrangements became more luxurious , and with the great increase of society attendant upon the advent of ladies at all the ports , social entertainments became more general and most costly , " says Forbes . What is more , the enchantment which the Chinese had always contrived to lend to themselves by maintaining their distance was gone . And yet , contemporary accounts reveal an almost exaggerated admiration for the Chinese . People spoke of China as a kind of widespread , though secret , Utopia , perfectly managed from end to end . The hong merchants who had the unenviable task of interpreting the Chinese to the foreigners and the foreigners to the Chinese , of guarding them like children , left an impression of general goodness and justness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intercourse there should have been so little friction . There were not , according to H. B. Morse , more than a dozen cases of homicide during the hundred years of trade which could be regarded as bearing upon international relations . " The best commentary , " he assures us , " on its commercial aspect is the admitted fact that there grew up side by side , during a century of joint working , a body of Chinese and foreign merchants , than whom there has never , at any time or at any place , been a more honourable , with many an occasion of help in time of difficulty , and with much sympathy and friendliness from one to the other . " The explanation for such amity is to be found in the character of the Chinese . We have mocked their pretence at superiority , we have laughed at the invisibility of the Son of Heaven . Yet the true test of worth lies in the ability of a people to accept temporary defeat . And there the individual Chinese gives proof of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in them it is innate . Houqua propitiated the gods even as he was paying for the ransom of Canton . Minqua , after being given the fullest explanation of the old European custom of defending one 's " honour " by duelling , was asked : " And now do you understand ? " " Oh , yes , me savee all . " " Then , suppose you should insult a person and be called out . What would you do ? " " Maskee , he call um me , me no go . " " Unmanly " as this seems to us , according to our code , it nevertheless developed in the Chinese a knack at getting round a situation at which they are past masters . How graciously a Chinese can accept defeat . While the negotiations were going on between the High Commissioner Keying and Sir Henry Pottinger , after the opium war , a little one-act drama took place during the intervening " festivities , " which shows how the Chinese can sink political animosity in personal friendliness . Keying gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , which to a Chinese is a tragedy , and when he learned that Sir Henry had , he offered to adopt him . Then , seeing a  | miniature of Lady Pottinger , he asked for it . It being the only one he had with him , Sir Henry hesitated to give it away . The High Commissioner made a flattering offer for it , which Sir Henry declined . " What ! " cried Keying . " Am I the governor general of the two Kiang and can not get my order obeyed ! " The little transaction was made , and the commissioner proceeded to sing a charming Tartar song . Then he took off a gold bracelet , made in the form of a puzzle with two hands clasped , and put it on Sir Henry 's wrists . This he asked him to keep as a token of friendship , explaining that his father had given him two of these when he was a boy of eleven , and that he had worn this one for forty years , while his wife in Pekin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still in the act of settling an unprovoked and unjust war , accept his defeat . And so does the legend of Chinese honesty and integrity hold our imaginations .  | NOT even Jefferson , whom the irate New Englanders accused of having declared a dilapidated old church " good enough for One who was born in a manger , " was content with anything less than a continent for a nation born on the beach . This aristocrat , with his contempt for commerce and mechanics , more than any other American , by virtue of his inconsistencies , gave to Vulcan a continent to roll his wheels upon . Yet there is not so much as a small state bearing his name . History has a way of laughing pretenders off their thrones . The wise and the practical , roaring their platitudes against the idealists and the visionaries , hardly touch their first reality ? Death ? when their liberated sons cash in on the gleam which their fathers firmly denied . The belief prevails in this land that we developed and moved forward west , south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and progress . Yet not an inch of soil was taken by the plough , not a lump of gold was washed in the waters of attainment but had previously been declared to be but barren and alloy . The story of this country is in part the story of denial and discouragement , of broken hearts and misplaced plaudits , and some of those whose vision saw the farthest have , because they were too far from the hour of achievement when the medals were being struck , gained nothing for their pilotage . The slogans wnich , when the dullest could see the advantage , became our " Manifest Destiny " and " Fifty-four Forty or Fight " had for more than fifty-four years been , to the majority , neither manifest nor militantly necessary . America was to them a great enigma made up of petty confusions , and few conceived its geographical possibilities . Chateaubriand , in " Atala , " gives us a picture of the New France as it was then  | conceived : " Four great rivers , having their sources in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which loses itself in the East , in the gulf of its own name ; the river of the West , which empties itself in the unknown seas ; the river Bourbon , which runs from South to North and falls into Hudson 's Bay ; the Meschaceba Mississippi which runs from North to South , and empties into the Gulf of Mexico . " Narrow and circumscribed as the knowledge of the earth 's surface still was , tremulous Europeans , the progenitors of the Americans , had a grand way of claiming territories with a sweep of the hand , dividing the world according to their appetites rather than to their digestions . But once they obtained possession through exploration by sea , their dreaming seemed to come to an end and the things possessed lost flavour . Thus France , Spain , and England were content to frustrate each other 's schemes of empire by their conflicting claims in America , leaving settlement to adventurers and schemers . France might burst with speculation over projects for the development of the Mississippi . England might imitate her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , but as to going out there and actually struggling with the elements ? they were all too gentlemanly for that . We commonly hear that Great Britain lost " an American empire , " but as a matter of fact she lost merely a strip along the Atlantic seaboard . Had the colonies not broken away , it is certain that Great Britain would never have obtained even half of that empire . " France , " said Chateaubriand , " formerly possessed in North America a vast empire , which extended from Labrador to the Floridas and from the shores of the Atlantic to the remotest lakes of Upper Canada . " What remained beyond reverted to Spain , contested by Russia in the north Pacific . Had there been no growing republic on the scene , England would have been compelled to remain content with the fraction that was hers . But all the Powers had calculated without their offspring in America who were faced with the realities at their doors . The masses were pressing inward inch by inch , seldom seeing beyond  | the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land to hoe . The vast majority were too closely bound to the soil to dream of empire . Hamlin Garland , in " A Son of the Middle Border , " pictures these slow migrations when men picked up their families and moved on , and then , after a pause , began the pursuit once again . But from the time the colonies found themselves free from England , there were a few to whom the thought of having the whole continent , from coast to coast , under one management , as it were , became ferment in their minds . To them it seemed inevitable that at some future day there should exist upon the Pacific a great port from which the luxuries of the Indies should make their way over the mountains and bring something more than bread into the lives of those in the wide-spreading interior . Foremost among these was Thomas Jefferson , who had received his first inspiration from the Alastor of the American forests , John Ledyard . And in the decades to come there followed a succession of visionaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth of China , who saw as clearly as daylight that America 's future lay upon the Pacific . Before anything like that could happen , however , it was necessary to consolidate such lands and forces as already lay within the domains of the Government . Westward expansion was indeed synonymous with independence , as all the political pronunciamentoes of the next century indicate . But westward expansion was fraught with grave dangers . Washington saw only too clearly that a too hasty development of the continent would make for disintegration . Thus two well-marked tendencies are found in our national development , with appropriate checks and counterchecks to maintain the Union . One was to prevent alien interference in American affairs ; the other was to permit of growth westward only by a process of absorption . In that most dignified and wistful valedictory ? his Farewell Address ? Washington exhorts the ex-colonies to work for unity and the common good . A great deal has been heard about his cautioning us against entangling alliances , but this has been misunderstood . What Washington was afraid of was alli- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw with apprehension the jealous " watchful waiting " of the European monarchies . England was encouraging division by permitting trade with her freely only when cargoes were brought to England in bottoms belonging to the state whence the goods originated . Cotton from the South could not be transported , for example , by ships from New England . France was sowing dissension through her Genets , etc. etc . This division of interests encouraged from abroad stimulated sectional differences and aspirations within . The evils to be feared were party politics , petty passions , provincial and sectional tendencies . When the Mississippi troubles arose , there were loud threats of secession unless New Orleans were opened to the Western states along the great river . When , therefore , Washington felt that he was laying down the reins of government for ever , he condemned these separatist leanings within the republic lest they rend it asunder . " Any other tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage whether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the whole of the address . He was not afraid of the United States as a whole forming any alliance it thought fit , so much as of any single state making such " an apostate and unnatural connection . " Copies of the address had hardly been distributed throughout the country when the New Orleans trouble burst into flame . Not long afterward Clinton declared in Congress , " It has struck me with not a little astonishment that on the agitation of almost every great political question we should be menaced with this evil " ? secession . International strife was more to be desired than inner dissension . The maritime states were loath to be held tied to the plodding agriculturalists of the South and West . Washington had noticed these secession bubbles in the Southwest , while " the Western states hang upon a pivot . The touch of a feather would turn them any way , " he declared . Though he does not  | mention the Pacific , he had nevertheless sensed the westward trend , not unmindful of the seafaring enterprises of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The North , he pointed out , " finds its particular navigation invigorating , and contributes in different ways to nourish and increase the general mass of national navigation , " and the East " will more and more find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad " ? then largely the China trade . Washington was speaking as a father to his sons who are tugging away at the estate and threatening to break up the family . The concomitant of no alliances was naturally no interference . The ire at France and Spain in the South was identical with that toward England and Russia half a century later over Oregon . Then , as we shall soon see , too sudden westward expansion was feared lest in it lie disunion rather than growth . But before such a doctrine as that of Monroe could become necessary , the development of the whole continent must perforce continue apace . Without an objective , that development could not but lag or be wholly retarded . That object from the very beginning was China . The China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West by way of the Horn and was destined to exert an even more direct influence upon the westward drive that finally hurdled the Rockies . To Washington 's plea for a perfect union Jefferson had made a most important addition . Jefferson saw that there could be no solid union without a solid continent behind it . He did not believe in too much government , but he did believe in the spreading of common ideals so far and so wide that they would in themselves , even through political disunion , hold together . Early convinced that Ledyard was right in regard to the opening of the West , Jefferson had lived to see that dream converted into a fact by Captain Gray of the Columbia . When at last Jefferson became President , his first interest was in sending an expedition that would explore the country , even as he had urged Ledyard to do so when he was Minister to France .  | " To a statesman like Thomas Jefferson , " says one of his biographers , " it was evident that a large portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no barrier of nature , would be eventually embraced within their boundaries . He was convinced , therefore , of the propriety of its being explored by a citizen of the United States , and regretted the failure of Ledyard 's attempts in his own country to engage in a voyage before the same thing had been meditated anywhere else . These views were deeply impressed on the mind of Jefferson , and in them originated the journey of Lewis and Clark twenty years afterward , which was projected by him and prosecuted under his auspices . " Until 1803 , such an expedition was doubtful of success , but Jefferson planned to accomplish it indirectly . Long before he even dreamed of purchasing Louisiana from France , he was preparing to send Merriwether Lewis to determine the resources and outlets of the lands in front of and beyond the Rockies . The expedition was actually under way , with the consent and support of Congress , though it was to pass through territory not belonging to the United States . Some secrecy had to be maintained . Jefferson wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore the Mississippi has been generally given out . It satisfies the public curiosity and masks sufficiently the real destination . " But suddenly , the juggling of the schemes of empires had shifted the Mississippi region from the hands of Spain to those of France . For all his love of France , Jefferson realized that having only just fought off England , and being in the briars with her yet on the question of impressment and the freedom of the seas , it was bad enough to have dissolute Spain at the rear , but infinitely worse , imperious France . The precipitate blocking of New Orleans by France , which was bound to follow , would frustrate every possibility of this country 's natural development toward the Pacific . Monroe had written on January 13 , 1803 : " On the event of this Mississippi River depend the future destinies of this Republic . If we can not , by a purchase of the  | country , ensure to ourselves a course of perpetual peace and friendship with all nations , then , as war can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for that course , without , however , hastening it . " It was at that moment , perhaps , that the doctrine of Manifest Destiny first found expression . Two months before Monroe and Livingston bought the whole of Louisiana from Napoleon ( February , 1803 ) Jackson , speaking on the Mississippi Question in Congress , expressed the conviction that New Orleans must eventually belong to the United States . " God and Nature , " predicted Jackson , " have destined New Orleans and the Floridas to belong to this great and rising empire . . . and the world . . . can not hold them from us . " God , Nature , and Jefferson , he should have said . It is inconceivable that Napoleon would have given away this vast territory if he had not thought that by so doing he would weaken England where she could stand it least . France had lost India to Great Britain , but America was rapidly becoming England 's most serious rival in the Oriental trade . Feeling that he had made a poor bargain even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the world , and is reported by Marbois to have said : " This accession of territory strengthens for ever the power of the United States , and I have just given England a maritime rival that will sooner or later humble her pride . " How could Louisiana produce a maritime rival to England ? Every statement by almost every man who had anything to do with the exploration of the region after the purchase points to the potent factor it would become in the prosecution of the China and East India trade . With Louisiana safely in American control , the scheme for its exploration under Lewis and Clark need no longer remain masked . Now Jefferson could say he was merely taking inventory of the new possessions . The destination could now be openly declared , and Congress , in appropriating $2,500 for the  | expenses of the expedition , put it down " for the purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States . " From now on the objective is frankly stated . Jefferson 's instructions to Lewis show that his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were " to explore the Missouri River and such principal streams of it as , by its course and communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean , whether the Columbia , Oregon , Colorado , or some other river , may offer the most practical and direct water communication across the continent for the purpose of commerce . " His object was so to open the country that trade might thereafter be " conducted through the Missouri and United States more beneficially than by the circumnavigation now practiced . " The circumnavigation he refers to is of course that round the Horn for furs to the Northwest coast and China . But he is even more definite . He suggests that they discover " the practicability of taking the furs of the Rocky Mountains direct to China , upon the line of the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean . " Now , the reason for Jefferson 's eagerness to open the country all the way to the Pacific becomes more explicit when we consider the state of affairs at the time on the Atlantic . If an overland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complications which trans-Atlantic seafaring was subject to . The impressment difficulties were at their height . England was imposing new restrictions upon the trade which was giving the United States an annual revenue of $1,300,000 . While Britain was adamant in the matter of the West India trade , she doled out the East India commerce with irritating restrictions . " Are you not contented with being free and happy at home ? " asked John Randolph in Congress . " Or will you surrender these blessings that your merchants may tread on Turkish and Persian carpets , and burn the perfumes of the East in their vaulted rooms ? . . . Do you meditate war . . . for the fair trade that exchanges your surplus products for such foreign articles as you require ? No , sir , it is for a circuitous trade ? an ignis fatuus . " This was the same John Randolph who not many years before during a sojourn in Providence , where  | he understood but ill the local dialect and enjoyed much less the local diet of ham and eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too high for clams , but there would be served some capital quahogs : " Good God ! More bacon ! " The curtailments on the Atlantic were an ever-increasing source of discontent . Mr. Findlay , as though retorting to Randolph , explained that " though these aggressions have hitherto been principally committed on cargoes of Colonial produce , where only we can find a market for the produce of the Middle and Eastern states ; yet the principles are equally applicable to much of our East India trade , and to the trade of France , Spain , and Holland , from which we derive most of the favourable balance of trade , which enables us to discharge the unfavourable balance of trade with Great Britain . " In these circumstances , it would seem that the whole country would have seen at a glance the excellent advantage to be gained by an overland route free from all possible interdictions which would be opened by the purchase of Louisiana . But poor Jefferson , with all his keen foresight , tremblingly sought the consent of Congress to the acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To most it was a white elephant that would never yield a fraction of return on the investment . The moderate maintained that though it may not be an Elysian region like Homer 's Fortunate Islands , it was nevertheless fertile and salubrious . " Geography points us to China , Persia , India , Arabia Felix , and Japan , " said Elliot in Congress , " countries situated in corresponding latitudes , which , though always overshadowed by the horrid gloom of despotism , are always productive and teach us by analogy that Louisiana , in natural fertility , is probably equal to those beautiful Oriental regions . " Thus , the idea that in Louisiana the United States had acquired a new Eden was balanced by the declarations of the lugubrious that it was a dreary and barren wilderness . To the seeing ones it seemed as though America had found an Orient at home . To Jefferson , Louisiana was an escape from the thralldom that hung over the Atlantic . And when Lewis and Clark set  | their faces toward the west , they were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their undertaking and the immensity of the possibilities they were about to open to posterity . Lewis had definitely in mind the trade that in Jefferson 's eyes justified the expedition . Their sensations , when on November 7 , 1805 , like Balboa three centuries before , they stood and gazed for the first time on the Pacific , may be best told by Clark , though but half expressed in clear English . They had come " in view of the Ocian , this great Pacific Octean which we have been so long anxious to See . and the roreing or noise made by the waves brakeing on the rockey Shores ( as I suppose ) may be heard distinctly . " And so the dream of John Ledyard became a prosaic fact . Few dared hope too much from their appraisement . None grasped its full significance . That there would some day flourish a land greater than the whole of Europe would have seemed preposterous . Even Thomas Jefferson felt that there would develop several nations , rather than one , from coast to coast . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project : " I considered as a great public acquisition the commencement of a settlement on that point of the Western coast of America , and looked forward with great gratification to the time when its descendants should have spread themselves through the whole length of that coast covering it with free , independent Americans , unconnected with us except by the ties of blood and interest and enjoying like us the rights of self-government . " Instead of Washington 's more perfect Union , Jefferson 's ideals tended toward some form of cooperative imperialism . To Jefferson 's opinions Secretary Gallatin assented . In a letter on the Oregon Question , he said : " The inhabitants of the country , from whatever quarter they may have come , will be , of right , as well as in fact , the sole legitimate owners of Oregon . Whenever sufficiently numerous they will decide whether it suits them best to be an  | independent nation , or an integral part of our great Republic . . . . Viewed as an abstract proposition , Mr. Jefferson 's opinion appears correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Pacific American nations , whilst entertaining the most friendly relations , to remain independent rather than to be united under the same government . " In the true sense of the word , then , the purchase of Louisiana was not prompted by aggrandizement or imperialism . It was a form of land hunger , but not that of the conqueror . Russia 's seeking for an outlet on the Bosporus or on the Pacific is more analogous and as justifiable . But why should this " hunger " for land have existed in a country scarcely able to utilize the area allotted to it ? The use of the term " expansion " only confuses the problem . There was land speculation enough and it brought such eminent men as Robert Morris to their ruin and drove people like the parents of Hamlin Garland ever westward . But that accounts for this early movement only in part . Nor do the love of adventure and the aggressiveness of the missionary fully illumine it . The one thing that gives it its raison d'etre is the China trade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an objective . If there is obstruction in the Atlantic , if the old nations will frustrate our efforts , we will turn our backs on them , and with an opening on the Pacific , find egress for our continental energies through a region so far from Occidental turmoil as to be free from all entanglements . So we have achieved the isolation China always craved and our friendliness with that great people has been part compensation for our early difficulties with European snobbery . One man there was who , despising those entanglements most , also did more than all others to realize this achievement . That man was Thomas Jefferson . " That great man , " said Thomas Hart Benton , " always intent upon benefiting the human race , had conceived the grand idea of a commercial intercourse with India upon this line of communication . . . . And thus Mr. Jefferson was the first to propose the North American road to India . "  | DURING the years that intervened between Jefferson 's expedition to the Columbia and the time of the admission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ westward had fully established the greater need for an outlet on the Pacific . The struggle over the slavery question not only delayed the creation of new states , but because of it encouragement for further expansion was withheld . The allotment of three states to the South and seven to the North created a frantic effort which materialized in the purchase of Florida and the treaty with Spain in 1819 . Thus was the development of the country northward through to Oregon checked and split , giving the impetus to the thrust to California by way of Texas . What then became loudly known as our " manifest destiny " was in the last analysis only a struggle over slavery aggravated by the fears of too hasty Western development that might result in either a secession or in the projection of an independent republic on the Northwest Pacific . By 1820 , Jefferson , who had even advocated the rearing of national offspring on that coast , trembled at the prospects looming up in Missouri and beyond . " I considered it at once the knell of the Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific came to counteract the growing tendency toward disunion . The Russian-American Fur Company was active again , and had been instrumental in obtaining a magniloquent ukase proscribing the use of the Pacific to any peoples , not excluding the United States and Great Britain . In a trice the eyes of America were once more focussed upon the Pacific and the Orient . Once more a sense of the unity of the continent took hold of the imaginations of men . On March 30 , 1822 , Secretary of State J. Q. Adams de- Glared to the Russian minister : " From the period of the existence of the United States as an independent nation , their vessels have freely navigated those seas , and the right to navigate them is a part of that independence . " Latent within that pronouncement was the note of the " manifest destiny . " The nation that but twenty years before was trying merely to buy a small roosting place on the Mississippi was already openly challenging the mightiest empire for its natural rights on an ocean upon which it had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the storms or drive a peg into a stove-in hulk . The very next year , it was not merely a right to navigate those seas : it was a challenge to Russia not to set foot upon American soil below Alaska . Again , not on the grounds of actual possession . But , says Adams , " I told him the Russian minister that we should contest the right of Russia to any territorial establishment on this continent , and that we are no longer subjects for any European colonial establishments . " Jefferson , still mistrusting Great Britain , again chose the lesser prospect of evil ? alliance with her . But Adams , now more keen than the elder statesman , saw that in the event of failure to make Russia withdraw the ukase he would have England in Oregon , France in Mexico , and Russia in California and Alaska , and determined to stand his own ground . The Monroe Doctrine , so-called , while aiming to prevent the dismemberment of South America by the Holy Alliance , was first and foremost the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China trade ) . And the same period that saw the end of foreign settlement in America saw the beginning of the last drive overland to the Pacific , as we shall now see . It was obvious that Spain was crumbling from within . Force the allies to wait , and the Southern section of North America would fall into our basket . Thus was the consummation of the doctrine of American independence of all European control made at the very point where the nation had made its first diplomatic achievement . For it will be remembered that it was for fear lest America accept Jefferson 's suggestion and form an alliance with Spain and  | France against England over the Nootka Sound controversy in 1790 that England deemed it wiser to dispatch some representative to America , a move she had long refrained from making . The practical men of the world are for ever chiding the dreamers for keeping too strained an eye on the horizon . Yet what would they ? To the blind the sense of touch suffices , but God had other concerns than merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress across the country the same ordination made of each promontory a perch from which to scan the beyond . The opening of Louisiana was merely proof of the need of Oregon . A full round century before , when John Law dreamed of the settlement of the Mississippi , vessels had been armed , troops had embarked , prostitutes and vagabonds had been collected in order to dispatch them to these solitudes with a capitalized backing of a hundred million francs . But it was an altogether different project that raised its talons with the admission of Missouri into the Union . At " Brown 's Hotel " in Washington there resided two gentlemen who represented the interests of John Jacob Astor , interests that by 1821 amounted to some thirty million dollars . These gentlemen , Ramsay Crooks and Russell Farnham , had made the acquaintance of Dr. John Floyd . There shortly joined the group another gentleman , the incoming Senator from the new state of Missouri , Thomas Hart Benton . Historians , in tracing the development of a nation , are apt to pick out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness and prove a predestined drive behind them . But nations , like the individuals of which they are composed , proceed haltingly , uncertain , eager , through moments of fear and passion , in all directions at once , inconsistent and yet bound by the ties of immediate necessity . Certainly the period under discussion elucidates this more than all others . Missouri had just been admitted after bitter years  | of wrangling . If every subsequent " child " was to be born under such dangerous circumstances , the " mother " might well have determined not to risk her life for future offspring . Yet before Missouri 's first senator was admitted to his seat , he was already complotting for the extension of our domain . Those who at that time held the position of preeminence called it unjust " expansion " ; those who had a guilty conscience dubbed it " manifest destiny " ; but eliminating both piety and pride , we discover sheer necessity simply obeying the laws of nature unmindful of slogans . Missouri , the first state west of the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eastern speculation and monopoly , or of turning in the direction of the Pacific where an outlet awaited her , free , except for primitive assumption and imperial conceit , from restrictions . For years Missouri had been the concourse of the trapper and the hunter . For years it had watched the furs from that dark interior take their course across the Pacific seas to China and fatten the larders of New Englanders who looked upon these Far Western pioneers as only more boorish savages . When at last the New West found its voice in national affairs , it is little to be wondered at that its birth cry was a lusty demand for a sea of its own . Most writers on our westward " expansion " attribute the wave of migration to restlessness , the proselytizing zeal , or sheer love of adventure . While without these traits only the most visible goal would have lured men , nevertheless , without a goal , their restlessness would have found satisfaction in less terrible play than that of the ' forties . There were several counteracting tendencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their anxiety to remain in the position of " mouth " or " delta " to that great river of wealth which all expected to pour down from the Rockies and over the plains . They could not look but with disfavour upon any project that might break open a sluice in the mountains and turn the stream toward the Pacific . Nevertheless , they had for decades been in close contact with the Pacific coast , the maritime circumstances suited their taste  | and inclination , and their priority itself would stand them in good stead should the inevitable development occur . But the New West had no such alternatives . The struggle over slavery had begun . Yet , those who took up the cry of " On to the Pacific and Oregon ! " unlike the clamourers for Texas and California , were , by so much , blocking the progress of slavery . Strangely enough , the two who led the fight for Oregon ? Floyd and Benton ? and most of their supporters were from slave states , and Benton himself was a slaveholder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have diverted attention from Oregon along with the JacksonTyler hosts . But they saw opportunities more luring than involuntary servitude would ever net , and with the persistence of dreamers and visionaries they became the advocates of " On to Oregon ! " Doctor Floyd , who had been governor of Virginia , had entered Congress in 1817 but seems never to have forgotten that a cousin of his , Charles Floyd , had been one of the company of Lewis and Clark . John Quincy Adams alleged that a greater and nearer concern interested Floyd in the opening of Oregon to settlement : that his brother-in-law had absconded after having embezzled some of the finances of the state when he was its Treasurer , and settled on the coast . But in those days , as now , office seeking was not always for altruistic motives ; so we shall dismiss this for what it is worth as political mud slinging . But certain it is that Floyd 's prolonged and unflinching devotion to the opening of the Northwest must have had deep roots , else it would hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter of slavery . For , as his colleague and his peer in this cause said , Floyd " took up this subject which seemed more likely to bring ridicule than credit to its advocate . " It is doubtful if Floyd would have undertaken this project alone , even with the stimulus Astor 's agents could give . It is quite likely that the year before he moved that the House investigate the Oregon claims , he had read an essay written and published at St. Louis on the Oregon-Asiatic Commerce .  | Doubtless he also knew the author himself , and was elated with the prospect of his coming to Washington in his capacity as senator from the new state of Missouri . And so , when Senator Thomas Hart Benton arrived , pending the actual admission of his state into the Union , and found himself with little to do for the greater part of the year when admission hung fire , he spent much of his time in the company of Floyd and the agents discussing the Oregon question . The House moved , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on January 25 , 1821 , the Committee reported that " they have carefully examined the subject referred to them , and from every consideration which they have been able to bestow upon it , believe , from the usage of all nations , previous and subsequent to the discovery of America , the title of the United States to a very large portion of the coast of the Pacific Ocean to be well founded . " In the debates that followed the introduction of this bill , Floyd went fully into the importance of the Canton trade , the whaling , the tremendous possibilities in Oregon for fish , particularly salmon , timber , vegetables , the easy communication with the Indies ? such information as he had from Astor 's men and from Benton . He pictured the existing conditions on the coast which for years had been the theatre of a vast enterprise in furs and whales and seals , and prophesied a great increase in trade with the Orient through that channel . This he declared , " seems to demand immediate attention . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with from the British , and showed how the Canadians had reaped enormous advantages . " Their exports from Quebec alone are valued at more than a million annually . " A great deal more furs were taken into the United States and shipped by way of New York and Philadelphia direct to China or India , and some of them found their way thither on East India Company ships . Some made the journey round the Horn to Boston and were immediately reshipped " for the benefit of drawback . " IIe distinguished between ordinary commerce , in which we send our goods abroad for things needed , and this in which none of our  | produce is dispatched . A cargo of half or three quarters of a million in cotton and tobacco sent to Europe is still the original cargo , but in the fur trade and the fisheries not only is little capital necessary , or none at all , but to obtain a. cargo is like finding pure gold . A vessel " would return with that in exchange which would sell for perhaps double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and accommodation of the community $740,000 , which is the result not of a profitable voyage , but a creative trade . " All of which was merely by the way of justifying the occupation of Oregon itself for its own sake . " Would it not be better , " Floyd pleaded , " that our children occupy so large and beautiful a country . A country abounding in productions better in the rich markets of India and China than silver and gold , can not be left untenanted . . . . I shall , Mr. Chairman , close the few remarks I have to make , by an appeal to the House , to consider well our interests in the Western Ocean , on our Western Coast , and the trade to China and to India ; and the ease with which it can be brought down the Missouri . What is this commerce ? Has it not enriched the world ? Thousands of years have passed by , and , year after year , all the nations of the earth have , each year , sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riches of the East . This trade was sought by King Solomon by Tyre , Sidon ; this wealth found its way to Egypt , and , at last , to Rome , to France , Portugal , Spain , Holland , England , and , finally , to this Republic . How vast and incomprehensibly rich must be that country and commerce , which has never ceased , one day , from the highest point of Jewish splendour , to the instant I am speaking , to supply the whole globe with all the busy imagination of man can desire , for his ease , comfort , or enjoyment ! Whilst we have so fair an opportunity offered , to participate so largely in all this wealth and enjoyment , if not to govern and direct the whole , can it be possible that doubts , on mere points of speculation , will weigh with the House and cause us to lose for ever the brightest prospect ever presented to  | the eyes of a nation ? . . . England wants nothing now to give her the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages to come , but a position on our Western Coast , which she will soon have , unless you pass this bill . " The House was impressed , though not without some snickers . Mr. Trimble of Kentucky thanked Floyd heartily as politicians are wont to do , not only in his own name , and in the name of the people he represented , but , " he believed , of a great portion of the American people . " In that he was more correct than are historians of the subject . He repeated some of the representations of Floyd , the advantage of the trade , of control over an ocean that " is the richest sea in the world , and is as yet without a master , " and while he could not take issue with or enlarge upon these prospects , he did feel that the thing to do right now was to " give your people the bounty land , and let them go and make a settlement and form a nucleus around which other emigrators may collect , and time will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the future , " posterity will know how to take care of itself . " Mr. McDuffie of South Carolina , with the wisdom of the practical man , thundered : " I would not give a pinch of snuff for the whole territory . I wish to God we did not own it . . . . If I had a son whose conduct made him a fit subject for Botany Bay I would say , in the name of God , go there . This is my estimate of the importance of the Settlement . " Nevertheless , the House passed the bill " to provide for occupying the Columbia and Oregon River " ( later omitting " Columbia " ) by a vote of 113 to 57 , on Thursday , December 23 , 1824 . Three years of annual agitation was required , but the majority showed that Trimble was right about the feeling of the American people . When the report of the Committee reached the hands of Monroe , he turned it over to John Quincy Adams for his recommendations . Adams , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , during the opium war , turned so bitterly pro-British in the quarrel , now scorned the work of Floyd , whom he accused of malversation , and declared that  | the report " was a tissue of errors in fact and abortive reasoning . " All he could suggest was that it be given to the fire . But if Adams thought he was through with the issue in that way , he had counted without Benton . He might accuse Floyd of feathering his own nest , but none had the slightest grounds for suspecting the intrepid Benton . Had not Benton turned down every land-dealing client in his state the moment he was elected to office ? Was not Benton himself a slaveholder , and hence could not be accused of a bias in connection with his advocacy of Northwest settlement ? Benton , though born in North Carolina , was not , as Roosevelt remarks , a Southerner , but a Western statesman , the first of his breed . The " new West " was in the same position with regard to the Eastern states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion . " When our ancestors embarked on the sea of independence , " says John Bassett Moore , " they were hemmed in by a system of monopolies. , It was to the effects of this system that the American revolt against British authority was primarily due ; and of the monopolies under which they chafed , the most galling was the commercial . " The new West was not merely an offshoot of the old , but it was a new " nation , " with distinct interests and separatist tendencies . It had to break through the Eastern monopolies just as the East had to break those of Europe . The East had turned to the Indies ; so the new West was seeking an outlet of its own across the Rockies . And the most alert Westerner of the time was certainly Benton . He had roamed the plains with his men as a youth . He had been fired by the prospects of the Northwest . But ( and we have this on the authority of his daughter ) he had drunk in the stories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home readings my father had studied the trial of Warren Hastings , and Clive and India were almost as close to his boyhood as our war is to the boys of to-day . The struggle for India and its trade greater than that of Tyre and Sidon ' made the story of a great war on a background of Oriental splendour . " And , as we have seen , he had gone with Jefferson in imagina- tion to the ends of the continent . And now he was in a place in Congress where his voice might speak on behalf of ? not expansion , as Roosevelt erroneously claims ? but of the rights of the new West . What most Easterners fail to realize is that the West could not remain as smugly content as the East . The impulse of the West was not merely land hunger ; no more manifest destiny than one can say the child 's right to six feet of height is manifest destiny . The West could not just become the tail of the East . It wanted a mouth of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day Benton took his place in Congress , which was in 1821 , to the signing of the Treaty with England over Oregon in 1846 ? a round quarter century ? Benton never lost sight of that gleam . " Within one year after the occupation of the Columbia , " prophesied Benton , " the rich productions of the East Indies would flow into the valley of the Mississippi , upon this new and truly national route . " It is interesting to speculate on how accurate would have been his prediction had not the gold rush of California suddenly swerved all human interests from Oregon to the country to the south . But that he was not a bad prophet is evident from a speech he made in the Senate in 1820 . " Within a century from this day , a population , greater than that of the present United States , will exist on the west side of the Rocky Mountains . I do not deal in paradoxes , but in propositions as easily demonstrated as the problems in Euclid . Here , then , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five equal parts , and there will be found , in the valley of the Mississippi , three parts ; on the east side of the Alleghany Mountains one part , on the west of the Rocky Mountains , one part . " And then he proceeds to show that by 1920 there would be a hundred and sixty million people in the United States , " of which a hundred millions will drink the waters which flow into the Mississippi , and sixty millions will be found upon the lateral streams which flow , east and west , toward the rising and the setting sun . " Evidently , Benton was impressed with the discussion of population set afoot by  | Malthus which had just been debated in print by William Godwin . But what are thirty or forty millions more or less to us in these days , and we are reaching the 120,000,000 to-day . At this point Benton overshot his mark , which has been a weak point in his reputation ever since . Almost all who give any consideration to him quote these statements . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the establishment of a civilized power upon the opposite coast of America , could not fail to produce great and wonderful benefits . Science , liberal principles in government , and the true religion , might cast their lights across the intervening sea . The valley of the Columbia might become the granary of China and Japan , and an outlet to their imprisoned and exuberant population . " Of this Roosevelt , who in style and personality was not at all unlike Benton , has much to say . " It seems incredible that any man of even moderate intelligence should not see that no greater calamity could now befall the United States than to have the Pacific slope fill up with a Mongolian population . " But we must remember that Benton was a slaveholder . Doubtless , in his mind , since slavery was becoming such a bitter subject of controversy , he saw in the possible importation of hordes of cheap Chinese coolies a means of developing the region , even as many a man in our own time has done in Hawaii and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance sincere is to stretch the benefit of doubt which he deserves , for he most decidedly opposed the inlet of the exuberance of population from Great Britain and would have surely opposed it from Russia and France and Spain . But one can forgive erroneous selfinterest when it is carried as ballast upon a clipper ship whose speed would otherwise be uncontrollable . His fellow countrymen refused to give him cargo . Yet there he was , facing the headwinds like those the New Englanders had faced at the Horn . He had to appeal to hard men , practical men , men who could not understand anything but the most obvious , and he had to resort to oratory to keep his own courage fresh . And he promised them that if they settled Oregon , connecting the trade of that river and coast with the Missouri and the Mis- sissippi , they would " open a mine of wealth . . . surpassing the hopes even of avarice itself . . . of things which will purchase the manufactures and products of China at a better profit than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fustian in Benton 's speech , and this has militated against his reputation . But in the light of the development of this country Benton takes his place beside prophets and dreamers whose genius had transcended the material views of life and who showed that the things that make up the stuff of life , of progress , of achievement , can not be measured by the grocer boy nor appraised by the grocer whose wealth depends upon the frugal consideration of a half cent here and a penny there . Other men came to the support of Benton : Francis Baylies of Massachusetts , Lewis F. Linn , and others . But the greatest opposition arose from those in the East who seemed to fear the loss of their populations by westward migration . " The interests of the residents of the new territory , " said a Mr. Corey , " would be in the Orient rather than in the parent country . " Smyth of Virginia opposed the extension of our federative system too far , inasmuch as it was maintained only upon the wish of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . Mr. Tucker objected on similar grounds . He saw the peoples on the coast trading not with our East , but with China and Japan and the Philippine Islands , and thither their interests would draw them . " What common interests can they have with us on the Atlantic ? I have no wish to see introduced among us those distant praetorships whose effects were so pernicious in the Roman Empire . " Few realized then or since how far our actual possession had already gone . Even Roosevelt , while granting that the title of Britain was not more secure than our own , falls short of grasping the extent of contact we had had with the Pacific when he slurs our pretension with the statement that it rested " upon the inaccurate maps of forgotten explorers , or upon the chance landings of stray sailors and traders . " Had Roosevelt had some full and accurate account of the early intercourse with  | China and the Pacific , he could not have fallen into this error . Roosevelt , for instance , gives Benton credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly Republic on the Pacific coast " instead of Jefferson , as we have seen . Nothing stimulated the interest in Oregon so much as the loss of the little America was compelled to yield to the English . In England George Canning , Foreign Secretary between 1822-27 , smarting under the restoration of Astoria in 1818 , flayed Parliament for surrendering rights which England appreciated more than did America . Captain Cook had been in the employment of the East India Company when he made his explorations of the Pacific , and never did the British lose sight of the importance of a strong position on the Northwest coast . But the day of the East India Company was done , and the people , once free to avail themselves of opportunities long held from them by that monopoly , thought to regain what they were losing , if possible . The charter of the East India Company expired in 1834 , and the China trade was opened to all Britons alike . By that time , Americans were more securely entrenched than almost all others , with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was it necessary to fix the boundaries on the Pacific Coast . Had Benton and the others been listened to and emigration encouraged , there would have ensued a normal process of settlement which would have frustrated the assumptions of the British fur interests . They could have had the best part about Vancouver by virtue of squatters ' rights , but in August , 1835 , they chose rather to offer " half a million dollars for the Bay of San Francisco and certain adjacent territory as a resort for American vessels in the Pacific . " " The possession of these harbors , " wrote Waddy Thompson , Minister to Mexico , on April 29 , 1842 , to Webster , " would . . . no doubt , by internal communication with the Arkansas and other west streams secure the trade of India and the whole Pacific Ocean . " But Mexico had plans City of Mexico in 1827 , it is found that even the Spanish were planning to inaugurate a line of  | vessels from Monterey to China . Suggestions for the opening of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as early as 1822 and the whole push to the Pacific begun : not through land hunger , for the population did not go much beyond 15,000,000 , but through the half-conscious dream of the rape of Asia . Even those who went for the love of adventure had seen this vision ? they had beheld Ignifer , the great diamond . Captain Benjamin Louis Eulalie de Bonneville , of whom Washington Irving wrote at such great length , friend of Thomas Paine and the Marquis de Lafayette , had obtained an impression of the profits to be derived from the fur trade , and had plunged into the Far West . Nathaniel J. Wyeth , of Cambridge , Massachusetts , had been in the employ of Frederic Tudor , the Boston ice king , as a boy and had then felt the hunger for the East . Something of the fibre of old Tudor was in Wyeth , for on September 6 , 1835 , he wrote his former employer : " The business I am in must be closed not that it might not be made a good one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the men to make it so . The smallest loss makes them fly the handle ' and such can rarely succeed in a new business . " How well Tudor knew this ! How good it must have sounded in his ears ! Then comes the most spectacular of them all : Lieutenant John C. Fremont , son-in-law of Benton , and by some called " Pathfinder " and by others , " Pathfollower . " " In Mr. Fremont my father found his Ledyard , " writes Jessie Benton Fremont . In him , under these circumstances , one might expect to find an enthusiast for the Asiatic trade . Whatever views he held were obtained by actual exploration and investigation in the field . He spoke of the Columbia as one who had seen with his own eyes its possibilities , and to him it had " a value beyond estimation and would involve considerable injury if lost . . . . Commercially the value of the Oregon country must be great , washed as it is by the North Pacific Ocean ? fronting Asia ? producing many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its climate ? becoming , as it naturally will , a thoroughfare for the East India and the China trade . " Perhaps the story of Benton and Fremont were best told in the words of the daughter and the wife . " The long contest , the opposition , the indifference , the ignorance , the sneering doubts were in the past . From his own hearth had gone forth the one who carried his hopes to fullest execution . . . And so the two lives became one in the work of opening out our western country to emigration and secure settlement , and in the further acquisition of Pacific territory which gives us from sea to sea the whole temperate zone ' and brings our Pacific ports , across our continent , that longcontested-for India trade . . . . For with our Pacific ports came to us the Asiatic trade which was the underlying cause of all the wars of France and England for a hundred years . France lost India ? Canada and the vigilant English navy prevented her from protecting Louisiana . Then Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by giving over to her rebellious colonies the Mississippi and the Columbia . " The rest , the taking of California and of Texas , and all the explosive forces that made for the straightening of the lines of the United States across the continent remain for other histories to dwell upon . Here the work is done . Even the more sober had been convinced , and it remained only for the politicians , like Tyler , to pick up the cry " Fifty-four forty or Fight . " Roosevelt tells us that " Webster did not appreciate the importance of Oregon in the least . " Yet Webster 's son Fletcher tells us that Daniel had said : " You know my opinion to have been , and it now is , that the port of San Francisco would be twenty times as valuable to us as all Texas . " But even in the case of Texas we are told that when the question of annexation was up before Tyler , there were rumours to the effect that Great Britain " purposed using its influence in Texas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , and thus protect the sugar and cotton industries of the East and West Indies from the competition of the United States . " And we know that by that time the demand for American cotton in China had completely changed the nature of our trade with that country . Little wonder that the country which before had poohpoohed the whole idea of Oregon had turned testy . " The American Eagle is flapping his wings , " shouted the little chick in Missouri , the Platte Eagle ( 1843 ) , " the precurser sic of the end of the British Lion , on the shores of the Pacific . Destiny has willed it . " But Destiny prefers men of vision , even though they become somewhat bombastic at times , so long as they can spy out their future before they bump into it . And so in this case the shriek of the Platte Eagle has turned from one of delight to one of chagrin . Let us just look at the map of America and see whether the " destined end " was destined or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of the Pacific coast that could be self-supporting and independent as a great nation lies just above the line of the United States , about Vancouver Island . " Here , " an Englishman now tells us , " is evidently the seat of a coming Pacific power , even if it has not very extensive territory . " So we see that the practical men again failed us . Not that the present arrangement with Canada is undesirable and that a greater America would be better ; but purely from the point of view of the practical man , the thing sought after was lost , and lost by narrow practical sectionalism . When the opium war was fought and won , John Quincy Adams , who had despised Floyd , turned jingoistic in his dislike of the haughty , self-sufficient Chinese . But the Government , without ever having taken much interest in the Oriental trade before , now that England had broken down China 's resistance , stepped in and demanded most-favoured-nation treatment . The opening of numerous other ports gave considerable stimulus to the westward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The need for shorter and safer and quicker  | communication with our own people in the Far West and the Orient had become imperative . " When the islands of the Pacific Ocean shall be densely populated by civilized peoples , we may require the Panama Canal and others through the Isthmus , but not until then , " wrote R. B. Forbes , the China merchant . " Great stress is laid on the shortening of the route from the mouths of the Mississippi to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec , and it is made to appear that the whole country on both sides of the Father of Waters up to the Great Lakes , instead of sending its products east over railroads toward Europe , is to send them south to New Orleans , Tehuantepec , and all over the Pacific to Japan , China , the Pacific Islands , New Zealand , and Australia . " Forbes was a merchantshipowner , and railroads are not nice things unless they bring cargoes to fill little vessels . The Eastern men were not over zealous in the diverting of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the idea of a transcontinental road . " The mines of Mexico and Peru disemboweled would scarcely pay a penny in the pound of the cost . Nothing short of the lamp of Aladdin will suffice for such an expenditure . " George Wilkes of New York , however , suggested that the Government undertake the task ; but he was another who saw the Oriental gleam . Then came Asa Whitney , of New York , pioneer railroad promoter and locomotive builder , impressed , after a trip to China , with the great possibilities of the trade . In 1844 he petitioned Congress for a grant of land sixty miles wide , from Michigan to the Columbia , by way of which in thirty days we could go from New York to Amoy in China . " The drills and sheetings of Connecticut , Rhode Island , and Massachusetts and other manufactures , " he said in the old , old language , " may be transported to China in thirty days , and the teas and rich silks of China , in exchange come back . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he added , Oregon , whose great future he clearly depicted , would become a separate state , " and draw to her ports all the rich commerce of the Sandwich Islands , China , Japan , Manila , Australia , Java ,  | Singapore , Calcutta , and Bombay . If the road were built , Oregon would be held in the Union , and the United States would enjoy the commerce of the Far East . " And so a great deal of Oriental money , like that of the Sturgis family , went into the construction of railroads , the Boston &; Albany , Michigan Central , and the Chicago , Quincy &; Burlington . And James J. Hill also held the trade with China as the great object of his railroad construction . " Give us iron roads !

" In the park at St. Louis there stands a bronze statue of Thomas Hart Benton and upon the stone where those pathless  | THE belief that there was gold in the direction of the East had persisted like a buried memory deep in the unconscious of the human race . The universality of this faith with little or no evidence to support it tempts the fancy into strange paths .

Not to linger among these obscure regions of conjecture , it is yet difficult to understand why a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very face of terror and hardship finds its Moses and its Revelation . So was it with the search for gold . Yet in the search for the Gold of Ophir we find that every dream , inflated with the wildest imaginative prospects though it may have been , was , nevertheless , an intuition of a demonstrable truth . Columbus found an America . John Law 's Mississippi scheme was more than realized in Jefferson 's Louisiana Purchase . William Patterson 's Darien and John Jacob Astor 's Astoria both proved sound in theory even if a little premature in fact . Kendrick 's vagaries about an Isthmian canal became Roosevelt 's one great achievement . Even the South Sea Bubble was but a feeble intimation of the wealth that Englishmen have actually drawn from the South Seas . So it was that in California rivers of gold have actually poured out of the sands in which legend had located a Pactolus . For three centuries , according to Hubert Howe Bancroft , California was alleged to contain gold . Bancroft seems to have  | hunted down all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When gold was actually discovered it was found in no place that had been remotely connected with the legend . Nevertheless , the miracle of the discovery has only emphasized the value of mere rumour as the fingerpost to point man to his destiny . To most of these gaudy dreams Americans in general had been indifferent . They had stumbled upon California in the prosaic course of the Northwest trade and had not been above doing a little shopkeeping there by the way . Later vessels started a flourishing trade with the Spanish settlements in California , which ultimately became an end in itself , and quite distinct from the Canton trade , though it was often carried on by the same firms . The half-Spanish , half-Indian folk that idled their days away in the shadow of the missions of southern California were a thriftless sort . They would rather drink bad wine from Boston than squeeze the juice out of the grapes that grew wild on their own hills , and wore shoes made of their own hides that had been carried twice around Cape Horn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened shop on board , selling goods over the counter to visitors who came out to them in boats exactly like any corner store on the streets of Lowell or Lynn . To all the rumours of gold they heard about them they turned a deaf ear . In the country at large there was indeed beginning to be a real need for precious metals . From the time the China trade was initiated there had been a steady drainage of silver to China . " Gold , from being undervalued had ceased to be a currency , " said Benton , " had become an article of merchandise , and of export , ? and was carried to foreign countries . . . The Bank of United States was chartered in 1816 , and before 1820 had performed one of its cycles of delusive and bubble prosperity , followed by actual and wide-spread calamity . . . . The whole paper system . . . collapsed , spreading desolation over the land , and carrying ruin to debtors . The years 1819 , 1820 were a period of gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . No pride for property ,  | or produce . No sales but those of the sheriff and marshall . No purchasers at execution sales but the creditor , or some hoarder of money . No employment for industry ? no demand for labour ? no sale for the products of the farm ? no sound of the hammer , but that of the auctioneer , knocking down property . " In 1837 there was another panic , with distress reaching far and wide , exempting not even New York . Expansion , through speculative attempts to dispose of public lands , had precipitated disaster . Gold had been carried from the East to the West in order to meet the conditions set by Jackson in his Specie Circular of 1836 which lasted all through Van Buren 's administration into 1840 . More gold was certainly necessary in a growing country . It had to come from somewhere . Then came the great discovery . Among the Americans who had been carried to California in one of the three great waves of migration during that decade was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bancroft tells us . " I speak with exactness , for he was both a genius and queer . " In semipartnership with Captain Sutter , a Swiss caballero of California , Marshall had undertaken to build a mill upon the stream running through their lands . The freshets , aiding and abetting destiny , determined to sweep aside that mill and test the calibre of our hero . Against the evil intentions of the freshets Marshall won , and enjoys the commendation of Bancroft as well , who says : " It was not an unmanly act , the saving of his sawmill . " After damming up the stream with brush , and seeing that it held , Marshall and his men waited . As he was standing , above it he noticed a gleam of metal . He picked it up and carried it to Captain Sutter . In an eagerness that swayed between shouting it out to the whole world and keeping it absolutely secret , he drew the captain into a separate room , displayed his find , and then the two men assayed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completing the mill , they determined to keep the secret to themselves , but it got out . The men working at the mill promised to remain for six weeks , but while they kept their promise , the temptation to dig at  | least on Sundays was too great , and the dry rot of indifference fell upon their other labours . The wife of a little storekeeper wagged her tongue and the news spread . Within a fortnight pandemonium had been released and the gold rush was begun . Yet the fate of Marshall was the fate of most discoverers . " Of the profits derived from the enterprise , " he said , in his old age , " it stands thus : Yankeedom , $600,000,000 ; myself individually , $000,000,000 . " To Marshall is also given the credit for the discovery of gold in Australia , three years later . Hargraves had been told by Marshall that if he did n't like California he should go to Australia where he was sure there must also be gold . Hargraves went , and fared much better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery . At the time of the discovery in California there had been a sluggish migration westward . Men had heard the cry of gold before and had hardly responded . But this time there seemed little doubt in the minds of people . The cry once raised split in two the caravans that had cut their way northward toward Oregon . It trembled down the spine of the continent and set thousands of feet in motion from sea to sea . It swerved vessels out of their courses upon the billows of the deep . It roused sluggish races from their vegetative lethargy . It disorganized business . In New York men crowded the piers hoping for a chance to find standing room on some south-bound vessel , whereas in the Pacific , whaleship , merchantman , and pirate abandoned the water for the beach . Masters and slaves hobnobbed in close communion . The glories of the Indies were eclipsed and the East was given a momentary respite from Western pretension . And so it was that , lured by the wealth of the Indies , the European world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once set in ? one directly overland by way of well-tried routes , another by the timehonoured passage round the Horn . The more impetuous  | sought the inland waterways to New Orleans , and thence across the Isthmus of Darien , and by steamer again north to San Francisco . Men , untried to life on the plains , formed companies of from ten to fifty men , or a hundred , and , pooling their capital , faced the god Chance together . Business men and bankers , hod carriers and college professors , naturalists and writers ? all joined in the great exodus from every corner of the globe . Bayard Taylor went by the Isthmus route , while Audubon , the naturalist , turned northward through southern California . Though the overland trail was a long one and full of physical hardships , it was more attractive to manly prowess than the sluggish , sultry , crowded transport by steam or sail . Bancroft says that bad as it was for the first- and second-class passengers , those who went steerage " were treated more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but so much freight . " Human nature , alleged to be static , changed in the twinkle of an eye , and men once thought gentle and considerate reverted to the tusk and the claw and the game of catchas-catch-can almost the instant after they had embraced their mothers in farewell . " The emigrants we took on board at San Diego , " says Bayard Taylor , " were objects of general interest . The stories of their adventures by the way sounded more marvellous than anything I had heard or read since my boyish acquaintance with Robinson Crusoe , Captain Cook , and John Ledyard . " Overland , the stream of eager humanity , from Missouri to the jewelled Nevadas , stretched in one continuous chain of covered wagons . Never in the long , long migration of mankind has there been such an exodus , such a wild escape . Something akin to it may be imagined in the armies of Xerxes and Alexander , Hannibal and Napoleon , as they swept backward and forward across the face of Europe . Something akin to it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones and litter that stretched across the plains and mountains of this continent bore witness to the abandon with which men dashed for the fields . There is something pathetic in the way men , lifted from drudgery by this promise , sought to drag along every vestige of  | their former bondage with them into the wilderness . Something lovely too , for many of them seemed to realize at once that they were bound to dig foundations as well as diggings . Yet , in this vast pilgrimage , with gold and better living as the goal , men were destined to experience both degradation and sublimity before they achieved that end . There is the gruesome story , for instance , of the Donner party . About eighty men , women , and children had come to the edge of the desert early in the season and would have made the passes easily through the summer . A guide advised them to take a straight cut across the mountains , a new route he had discovered that would save them about two hundred and fifty miles . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and then , trying to cut their way through the forests , were overtaken by winter and the terrible blasts and blizzards . Soon they were caught in the snows of the Sierras and madness seized them . Cannibalism broke out , ghoulish bestiality took possession of them , and for the sake of preserving an ephemeral and doubtful joy called life , men , women , and children were swept into depths from which they never could emerge . It would have been something to the credit of human nature if those who killed to eat their fellows had walked instead boldly into that snowy sepulchre , inviting death cleanly rather than fall so suddenly and so utterly from the pedestal of civilization . But it was not so , and the account of that tragedy remains one of the most horrible records of human weakness , touched with unaccountable endurance and heartrending loyalty , that this country has ever witnessed . In California , under the first flush of exuberance after drinking the waters of Pactolus , men beamed upon one another in common delight . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , and so murder was condoned while theft was met with the direst consequences . California , with its " verdant spring vesture " and " arid robes under a metallic sky " shone impartially upon all comers , and the chilled heart of man softened to its wooing , amorous promise . So benign was this influence that our historian Bancroft could  | not check himself in his praises under seventy-five adjectives , not counting those hyphenated , ninety-nine nouns , and thirty verbs , all in one sentence . Yet Bancroft was sober . But not so California . " Drunk ! aye , drunk with avarice ! Behold the picture ; California in her cups , " cries Bancroft . And as though we might doubt him , adds , " nevertheless , thou wast drunk , California , as thou well knowest . " Altgether too euphemistic is this charge . It is hard to find that in any respect was life different from what it is and was elsewhere in the world . Everything was intensified , turbulent , boiling , and in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual incidents ? the murders , the duels , the robberies , the speculations , the immorality , all that is laid to the evil influence of gold ? these things occurred in the same manner , and on the whole , perhaps , even in greater quantity , in the rest of the country . If there was any point at which California was different from any other place in the world it was in the position gold had in relation to other commodities . But even in that there is no more room for criticism than there would be in chiding Pittsburgh for producing more steel than it produces silk . The stories that have come down to us from that time , of fortunes made and lost in the mines and at the gambling tables , have filled many a volume . Audubon tells of two friends who stood side by side , one having an ounce , the other six thousand dollars ' worth of gold at the end of the week . Bancroft " clowns " with the luck of a " nasal-voiced New Englander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his passage for four times its price , and took out $9,000 within a few days of his arrival , disposed of his claim for $2,000 , and " returned home to marry Hannah and set his traps for a deaconship . " With his usual fine sense of justice , he implies a little moral in the story of the Negro who was driven from one place to the other , and , finally , to where no white man would go , only to strike at the bottom of his shaft $4,000 worth of nuggets . These cases only emphasized the disappointments , however ,  | which in that land of rarefied experience were as much more bitter than the successes were sweet . The cost of living was immense . Eggs sold for half a dollar apiece and laundry was six dollars a dozen . " It is cheaper to buy new shirts at auction than to get the dirty ones washed , " writes one digger . Men used sacks of beans as paving stones to walk upon , and cookstoves too , when the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures outside the mines and in San Francisco brought desolation and despair to thousands . One old man with white whiskers , who had handled a wholesale grocery business to the amount of six million a year , ended his days as a bell-hop in a hotel . Men had " plunged their souls into a gehenna of inquietude and stinging battle , " says Bancroft in his inimitable style , and gives us pathos and gall in many a portrait of humans crushed and ravaged by despair . Suicides occurred by the hundred . Those who had fallen low enough and yet not low enough returned to the East , while others wallowed in debauchery and poverty rather than see their friends and folks again without their hoard . In a little gem of expression , Bancroft thus eulogizes the despised pawnbroker who hung up his imitation Apples of Hesperides in the land of gold and of poppy " Oh , my prophetic soul , mine uncle ! Many a proud head has bowed beneath the symbolic balls for the first time in California . Could the pledges at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what tales they would tell ; of what sighs , and poverty , and struggles , and despair they would speak ; of what broken vows , of what heartless cruelty , of what devoted love and self-sacrifice , of what agonizing deaths ! What touching , silent eloquence in those worn and faded articles , many of them once pledges of affection , now pledges of necessity ! " The Temple of Distress , he calls it . Reflecting upon these occurrences one wonders how it was that civilized people , precipitated so suddenly into the wilderness , were so helpless in the face of the elements and their own passions . There seems to have fallen upon every human  | faculty a great void , or a paralysis . Certainly hypnotism was never conducted on so tremendous and wholesale a scale . The mind was so centred on gold that it became bereft of reason and invention . A man building a canvas house for himself was without tacks and paid a new arrival gold for iron in equal proportions , instead of using his wits to devise some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent fortunes for lodging , instead of finding for themselves safe and clean spots in the open in a land which , at worst , is like an unpleasant spring . The gregarious instinct , fostered by the belief that the reward of luck is pleasure , brought men into the town and there sprang up instantly all that is vicious in civil life , unrestrained by any realization that happiness is more generally the result of unsatisfied desire than of desire glutted to satiety . And so gold itself ceased to give any respite . An altogether different affair it had been for Europe in the past . Then the appetite for Oriental riches had been well balanced not only with sufficient calories of toil , but with the vitamines of a superior culture . Along with the jewels and the gold of the Indies came the beauty and the ennoblement of its art . It was something in itself to desire such fineness . But here suddenly men were rushed into the troughs of Eldorado and they found what hardly served to ease the cramps of physical hunger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one influence that was already stirring the heart of that little community . With the inrush of men from every corner of the world , a cosmopolitanism permeated the social atmosphere that , notwithstanding its evil reactions , was nevertheless a permanent good . The streets and the gambling houses and even the few more orderly abodes were alive with stimulating influences . Hawaiians and Chinese , South Amerians and Australians , Frenchmen , Englishmen , Swedes , and Danes had not only to learn some sort of common speech , but to test their individual wits against strange habits and devices . To this day San Francisco has not lost that latent charm which is like some indefinable blend of tea , and remains one of the loveliest cities in America . True that the welding had to be burnt into a solid mass by the fires of hatred and conflict . True  | that the massacre of Chinese was as uncalled for as it was heinous and vile . But that was the weaker element burning itself out , and it was directed against these unfortunate Orientals only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became too self-destructive . Still , the brutal instincts found expression in strife and murder amongst the whites as well as in this contemptuous outburst against the yellows . It was not till 1856 that the outraged forces for decency locked horns with the degenerates of all races and worsted them . " If iniquity here was more unblushing , " says Bancroft , " there was less of cant and hypocrisy , less of covert deceit and pharisaical humbug , less of that white lying and envy and jealousy which constitutes the pabulum of older religious and fashionable societies . Loyalty to an honest and enlightened ideal is , after all , the truest morality . " One can not fully understand the thing that took place in California unless one first discovers the process of selection that went on in the migration . The question arises as to why some went and others remained . Why did not the whole world just rise up and go ? The ' 40 's , as will be remembered , were days of depression after wild land speculation . Fortunes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes , if at all . As in war , so in disaster , civilization takes its toll in young lives . The older men , having made a muddle of their lives , send their young ones to the front or the frontier to retrieve their own misfortunes . And in the gold rush it was largely the younger ones who were now allowed to go on the great adventure , " to dig for gold and graves in the barrens of California , " as a judge at Litchfield , Connecticut , declared . It seems that those who stayed at home sang pavans of praise more than those who went . " The extensive and fertile plains of the western country may yield richer harvests than those of Connecticut . . the golden regions of California may sooner fill the pockets with the precious metals , " said the Reverend Pierpont , grandfather of the Morgans , but in spite of " this exhausting  | process of emigration , our population which , in the year 1800 , was 41,671 , has increased to the number of 46,171 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population now that so many mouths had gone west and so much gold was going east , and the wherewithal to indulge in the largess of the world 's good things had been obtained . " We knew that there was more or less gold in the seams of those untrodden mountains ; but we did not foresee that it would build cities in the waste and plant hotels and gambling-houses among the haunts of the grizzly bear , " declared Parkman . " We knew that a few fanatical outcasts were groping their way across the plains to seek an asylum from gentile persecution ; but we did not imagine that the polygamous hordes of Mormon would rear a swarming Jerusalem in the bosom of solitude itself . We knew that , more and more , year after year , the trains of emigrant wagons would creep in slow procession towards barbarous Oregon or wild and distant California ; but we did not dream how Commerce and Gold would breed nations along the Pacific , the disenchanting screech of the locomotive break the spell of weird mysterious mountains , woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despairing savagery , assailed in front and rear , veil its scalplocks and feathers before triumphant commonplace . " But he failed to add , with Hamlin Garland , that behind these ploughmen and their wives and daughters , and the disinherited of the world was the " force of landlordism " goading them on into that desolate business of pioneering , and the mania for speculation sending thousands into the goldfields who could have earned much more and suffered less in the stolid pursuits of ordinary labour . In time men settled down to digging gold in the same prosaic manner in which they dig for coal or iron or lead . And California has become another state in a greater union . With all its climate and all its wealth and all its transplanted culture , California has not yet fulfilled possibilities that were latent in her gold . Gold has been greatly misappraised and much of ill attributed to it . But is it really more fruitful of evil than love ?  | There is hardly a basic human quality that is not related to it . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of gold had been woven into the very fabric of the human conscience . There it is synmsthetic with warm , glowing elegance , security , subservience , goodness , action , affections , religion , idolatry , creative thought , hope , moderation , opinion , approbation , precept , and youth . Even love , which is purer than gold , has been dubbed Golden-winged Eros , while patriotism cast a metaphor after the sun when it named a turbulent bar across a harbour in the Pacific the Golden Gate . And the world 's dreams of Heaven , virtue , good works , and all that makes up our conventional civilization are only the fulfilment of our secret wishes for gold . Or perhaps , after all , our dreams of gold are but our wish-fulfilment for Heaven . " One class live to the utility of the symbol , " said Emerson , " esteeming health and wealth a final good . Another class live above this mark to the beauty of the symbol ; as the poet , and artist , and the naturalist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the thing signified ; these are wise men . " To judge from the manner in which men have from time immemorial wasted their substance in the seldom satisfied search for gold would seem to indicate that they are living up to the thing symbolized . An Australian prospector has recently written an article for the Atlantic Monthly in which he shows that as soon as the prospector makes a find , he moves on , the love of the strange and lonely life rather than the precious metals being his true lure . Every man seeks for himself his own salvation . Most of us are weighted down and vaulted , and the ways of life are opened for us only through arduous thrift and artless spending . When suddenly the cry of gold lifts us above this ponderous inquietude , little does it become the pharisees to call us worshippers of Mammon . Is not Heaven said to be paved with gold ? It is those who live to the utility of the symbol that debase it . They barter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to squander it at the gaming table . Had they loved  | gold for the beauty of the thing signified , they would have found in California their freedom . But they did not really love liberty . When they left civilization and its prohibitions behind they became conscious of their nakedness and began to feel sinful . They loved their palliaments more than their emancipation . They did not trust themselves . And they fell into debauchery and license . Had they loved their gold for the beauty of the thing symbolized , for the relationship it bears to all that is fine and permanent in life , then might a new order have sprung up in that wilderness . For their gold they would then have bought all that is priceless and majestic from the farthest reaches of the globe and in that new Hesperides would have grown up a life and a culture to vie with the beauty and the splendour of the East . Some in California felt that . " Again and again , " says Audubon , " I am overwhelmed by the thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started intent on drawing and obtaining new specimens ? to have so different a destiny thrust upon me , is bewildering . " And so , instead of Arcadia we have business , buildings , and boosting ? a great world of more commerce , wealth beyond the dreams of the most opulent Oriental potentate ? but not the Indies . That is yet to be . One can buy it already made , but one can not make it in a moment . In centuries to come it will obtain upon the Pacific coast . There is every conceivable element from which it may draw its blood and its inspiration . The power that brought men across mountain , plain , and sea may yet accomplish this also . Who will ever measure the total good and evil , gold and alloy that came from that westward employment . In 1851 alone , $81,000,000 in gold was mined , while the first half-century of the discovery netted nearly a billion and a half of gold . Was this the dream of Columbus ? Was this the scent that mankind followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his stewards to the land that of old was called Ophir , but now the Aurea Chersonesus , which belongs to India , to fetch gold . " If for his Golden Chersonese he had looked on the  | eastern shores of the Pacific instead of the Malay Peninsula , how different would have been the story of mankind . Better ? No . But in the three thousand years that have intervened this continent would have had time to grow and ponder , to mellow with an age which for us is still to come and toward which we have only contributed a worthy impulse . Our works are yet to bear their fruits , and time alone will appraise them . The covered wagons were toiling painfully across the plains , requiring months of monotonous perseverance during the summer to bring a family over the passes to California . Steamers were flapping their side-wheels down the coasts and up again with the irritating precision that lacked sufficient speed and required a dangerous , sickening , costly break at the Isthmus of Panama . California was bursting with demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving hungry stomachs and despoliated profits , and speculation and waste where gold dust should have turned barrenness to beauty overnight . Speed ! If only there were means of helping feet to keep pace with their desires ! The gold wo n't last till we get there , seemed to be the fear . How to get to California on wings was the thought that kept restless men frantic through the nights . And here again China and the Indies came to the rescue . There had been need for speed before , when the art of smuggling opium into China in the face of Chinese interdiction , British competition , pirates , and the northeast monsoons , was being developed . While American ships had always gone with more canvas and lighter hulks than the British , there was still room for improvement . When the Opium War resulted in the opening of other ports in China , the increased importance of the tea trade had its reaction in the specialization of ships for that end . Eight million dollars ' worth of tea came into New York the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of even beating the British in their own ports , after the demise of the East India Company and the termination of the British Navigation Acts became more and more the object of American ship- owners . For nearly twenty years before the discovery of gold in California they were experimenting in the direction of the clipper style of ship , keen slender boats with yacht-like lines and carrying great clouds of canvas . It is said that the fine curve of the bow which is one of the distinguishing marks of the perfect clipper , and contributed so much to her grace , was suggested to Donald McKay , the great builder of clippers , by a Malay proa brought home . by one of the China ships from Singapore . Commodore Perry , in the record of his expedition to Japan , addressing a king of Siam , speaks of having seen one of his vessels-of-war , " one of beautiful form and construction . " He assured him that if he would send one of his ships to America , he could " promise the officers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , " the natives still offer for sale models of the various descriptions of the Malay war , pirate , and sailing proas ; and most of them present exceedingly beautiful specimens of graceful form . " Perry was so " struck with the beauty of the model of the sailing proa that he purposed sending one home to the New York Yacht Club . " Likewise , the practice of partitioning ships into watertight compartments was common in Chinese junks many years before . The clippers had their inception in the later period of the China trade . Though they are associated with our maritime enterprise everywhere on the seas , and some of the fastest raced between New York and Liverpool , their most spectacular exploits and conquests took place around the Horn , between New York and Canton . There they were triumphant . Whatever envy and jealousy obtained among the nations in pursuit of the teas and silks of the East , before the clippers all stood in admiration and from all throats came nothing but praise . In the eyes of every seaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed trade in the category of art . When one of the earlier tea clippers appeared on the Thames , an English newspaper described her as a thing so beautiful that " envy itself could find no flaw in her . " One of the most famous of the earlier clippers was the Houqua , named after the hong merchant of Canton . A model of this  | ship was presented to Houqua when it reached China . The Houqua was launched on Friday , towed down on Friday , went to sea on Friday , and arrived in Hong Kong on Friday . Whether that had anything to do with her fate is for sailors to tell , but she foundered in 1865 in a typhoon in the China seas . What would have been the fate of all the clippers if gold had not been discovered in California is hard to say . Doubtless they would have been slowly supplanted by the steamer without ever having truly come into their own . But when suddenly a whole growing nation wanted to be lifted bodily from one end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's imaginations could not permit themselves to be shackled to mere progress . Men wanted speed . The speed of the winds , the speed of lightning . Then it was that all the creative impulses in a people long bowed down by necessity and puritanical notions of thrift burst their bonds and gave expression to joy and abandon such as only the most pious had ever believed themselves menaced by . Then it was that a ship became the symbol of happiness , and none was so devout that he could not give way to cheers and a prayerful god-speed , and wink an innocent " Do n't mention it " at the enormous stakes that were placed on the races . And from the harbours of the Atlantic coast , bound for ' Frisco , rose these things of air and sinuous grace ? The Flying Cloud , Witch of the Waves , Shooting Star , Lightning , Gamecock , and Sovereign of the Seas . With the appearance of McKay 's clippers ? and others followed him-and their emotional and aesthetic appeal , the habit of racing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole world and became an international sport of the first magnitude . The first great race was staged in 1850 when , backed by thousands and thousands of dollars in wagers , with the whole of Manhattan and the Coast mad with excitement , seven clippers slipped out of New York harbour in a race to San Francisco . With every hold crammed with cargo , they were to make the terrible passage around Cape Horn in midwinter . One of McKay 's ships , the Sea-Witch , fighting her
