txt The New York City Tunnel Authority has adopted a final plan for the midtown vehicular tunnel under the East River and is sending it to the War Department for approval , Mayor La Guardia disclosed yesterday . Albert B. Jones , chairman of the Authority , together with Commissioners Albert T. Johnston and William H. Friedman , discussed the plan with Mayor La Guardia at the Summer City Hall in Pelham Bay Park . The War Department 's approval is required because of its jurisdiction over the East River as a navigable stream . The approval of the PWA is also required , because the $58,365,000 needed to construct the new tube will be supplied by that Federal agency . Both Federal agencies are expected to approve the plan as a matter of course , it was indicated . Both have been in close touch with the Tunnel Authority 's engineers and administrative officers regarding all features of the plan , and the final draft was made , under the direction of Chief Engineer Ole Singstad , after the War Department 's objections to earlier plans had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first contract will be let , Mayor La Guardia said , just as soon as the War Department and the PWA have approved the plan . It will be for the construction of a shaft on the Queens side of the East River . Later a shaft will be sunk on the Manhattan side and the work of building the underwater part of the tunnel will progress simultaneously from both shores toward midstream . The Tunnel Authority , which was created by the Legislature , has kept in close touch with Mayor La Guardia regarding various aspects of the plan . All three of its members were appointed by him in June , 1935 . Mayor La Guardia did not disclose details of the plan , but it was indicated that it would present a novel treatment of the vehicular traffic problem in the congested midtown area in Manhattan , The problem of providing , suitable approaches for the tunnel exit and entrance in this area was one of the major difficulties with which the Authority engineers were confronted . The full , long-term effectiveness of the new tunnel can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic arteries in Queens and Long Island , John Howes Burton , chairman of the East RiverThirty-eighth Street Tunnel Committee , said yesterday . Mr. Burton said that work upon the tube was expected to begin next month . He has been in close touch with members of the Tunnel Authority during its consideration of various plans . This problem of approaches , Mr. Burton said , was not one calling for immediate action , but the tunnel itself could hardly be considered a completed task until proper approaches from the Long Island side had been thoroughly worked out . The most effective treatment of this problem , he suggested , would be a " skyway " route extending at least from the tunnel mouth to the vicinity of Northern Boulevard and Broadway by way of a viaduct over the Long Island Railroad yards . " The tunnel authorities , " Mr. Burton said , " are to be congratulated on their plans for the New York entrances and exits to the tunnel . It certainly should be gratifying to the twenty-four organizations which constitute the East River-Thirty-eighth Street Tunnel Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great credit should be given to Messrs . Albert B. Jones , Albert T. Johnson and William H. Friedman for their untiring work . " The next most important step , in regard to which there is no immediate hurry , will be to develop approaches to the entrance of the tunnel on the Long Island City side . " Pointing out that the success of any vehicular tunnel depends upon its system of feeders , Mr. Burton said , " If one through-express lane of traffic could be built to the outskirts of Jamaica , connecting there with the Jamaica Ocean Skyway , plans for which have already been prepared , it would prove of great benefit . It would enable residents of New York to reach the ocean at Atlantic Beach , without speeding , in practically twenty-five minutes . " Also consideration should be given to the suggestion of the Queens planning committee for an express highway from the mouth of the tunnel over the Long Island Railroad yards to the vicinity of Northern Boulevard and Broadway , which would facilitate the traffic from the North Shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congested section of Long Island City .
