" The ideal college , " said President James Abram Garfield , " is one with Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on the other . " <P> In 1881 President Garfield was shot while on his way to Williamstown , Mass. for a Williams College reunion . Last week shady little Williamstown was jammed with some 700 Williams men , including his son , Williams ' President-Emeritus <P> Harry Augustus Garfield , Massachusetts ' onetime Governor Joseph Buell Ely and New York Times ' s Editor Rollo Ogden . <P> Their reunion was marked by no tragedy . <P> Nevertheless , like President Garfield they honored Mark Hopkins , who just 100 years before had become Williams ' most famed and most beloved President. * <P> Of the thousands who sat in Mark Hopkins ' classes only a scant 250 lived to journey to Williamstown for his Centenary . Those oldsters remembered him as a great , gaunt , Lincolnesque figure striding under the Williamstown elms in frock coat and top hat , carrying a gold-headed cane . Or they recalled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on slips of paper , stuffed them in a pill box and drew them out , one by one , for the order of recitation . Few could remember much more . Reflected Williams ' President Tyler Dennett last week : " In stitutions have many of the attributes of persons , but one quality they lack - mem ory . A college has life far beyond the limit of man . . . . " <P> Mark Hopkins was a big , serious-minded farm boy when he went to Willams from nearby Stockbridge in 1822 . After graduation he tried his hand at tutoring before entering the Berkshire Medical College in Pittsfield . Starting out as a physician in New York , he slept in his Greenwich Village office on a $25 sofabed which he described in letters home as a " really genteel article of furniture . " Year later he was eager to accept a call back to Williams to teach moral philosophy and rhetoric . With anatomy and physiology classes as well , he decided that he must have a manikin for classroom demonstrations . He bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by packing it behind him in his sleigh , circulating over the Massachusetts countryside- to deliver public lectures on human anatomy .
