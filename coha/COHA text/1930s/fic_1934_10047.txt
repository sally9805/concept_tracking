Myron presumably did have the ' flu , and for years he had worked too steadily , with too little sunshine and exercise , eaten too irregularly , and never , in fifteen years , spent more than seven consecutive hours in sleep . When he let go , the hotel doctor made him stay abed for two weeks . His nose ran , his temples ached , his eyes were hot , and he was shamefully weak , yet all the while he rather enjoyed his first experience of being nursed and not having to be responsible . He had time to think  --  even to think of something be/yond the comparative costs of bed linen with and without the hotel name woven into it .

He meant to be very profound about it . Possibly if his furlough had occurred not in 1911 but after the Great War , when it became the fashion to be disillusionized and revolutionary , he would have decided that his work , along with Faith , Hope , Charity , machinery , contemporary art , and the government had been futile . But he could feel none of the Puritanical guilt which afflicts young socialists and anarchists so much more than it ever does Preslayterian elders . He had enjoyed keeping hotel ! He had enjoyed making better bedrooms at lower prices . He had enjoyed competing with other driving young men . He did not , he admitted , see that his career had contributed notably to making the world perfect . But then he did not see that anybody 's career had done so , except possibly , just possibly , Shakespeare 's and Goethe 's and Edison 's and Rembrandt'sand Paul Ehrlich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frugal use of this time off by fretting about his soul .

He actually had time , that fortnight abed and another week achair after it , to see his friends , especially Alec Monlux , sometime manager of the Pierre Ronsard . Alec was manager now of the St. Casimir , a huge , dull , residentialhotel near Riverside Drive . What small distinction had ever been made between them as chief and subordinate had vanished now ; Alec was pleased to consider Myron an innovator in hotel-keeping , while he himself , he said , was " simply a glorified boarding-house landlord for a lot of old women with more money and fox terriers than good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his attentionsto the sick hero , and he brought in the damnedest gifts  --  a nice book of dirty limericks , a bottle of Piper Heidsieck , a puzzle in which ( for no reason that the impatientMyron could ever discover ) you were supposed to wiggle a steel ball through an asinine labyrinth of tiny nails , a box of Chinese candy , one quarter of which would have been enough to kill Myron in his present condition , and a most interesting pamphlet by John T. Semmelwack , of the Prince 's Own Hotel , Wabasa , Oklahoma , entitled , " A Study of Modern Flying Machines or Aeroplanes , with an Authoritative Account of the Achievements of Wright Brothers , Curtiss , Bleriot , &; Deperdussin , and a Prophetic Suggestion of the Future Effect of Universal Flying on the Installation of Resort Hotels in Locations Now Inaccessi-ble .

Rainier , served by aeroplanes . They outlined the size , number of rooms , tariff , method of procuringmilk , eggs , and oysters , decoration of the lobby , and whether to use bamboo or wicker chairs on the great porch . And that was the beginning and the end of the Mt . Rainier House . More often Myron saw Luciano Mora . It was rumored that Mora , the young , tall , curly-headed Italian , was the son of an important hotel proprietor in Naples , but whether or no , he had worked his way up from baggage porter to reservation clerk at the Westward . He was a student of hotel-keeping such as would not often be found among native Americans for another ten or fifteen years . He had worked in Paris and Baden-Baden and Madrid , and at the Adelphi in Liverpool ; he had come to New York to learn Americanese and American mechanical methods , and had gone so far that he now really liked corn on cob . He admitted that he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people at the Westward , but with all the fervor of any recent convert he worshiped , and incessantly talked about , the American hotel 's superiority in mattresses , vacuum cleaners , express elevators , automatically controlled central heating , and coffee . The Myron who had had for pious dogma the belief that the worst American hotel had better " service " and " accommodations " than the greatest palace hotel in all Europe had been shocked to find that Luciano was swifterp206and suaver in conciliating guests than Mark Elphinstone himself , and from Luciano he had received confirmation of his own mystical belief in the pride and value and honor of hotel-keeping . " Six generations my moldy old ancestors have kept tavern in Napoli , and now I am going to show the old buffers a really ' good hotel , " laughed Luciano . Not even with Mr. Coram of Torrington or Alec Monlux or Elphinstone had Myron been able to discuss innkeeping as though it were anything more than an interesting way of earning a living . But Luciano was as fanatic as himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have been had time , and Luciano Mora took it , and for hours they raved in an agreeable , childish manner not so unlike that of bearded painters at a Montparnasse cafe . " I 've been considering , " said Luciano , whose English was , of course , better than Myron 's , " the necessary languagesfor the front office of a real international hotel . No one person there need speak all of them , but naturally there must be someone who speaks any given one well . For a while I was content with English , Italian , French , German , Spanish , Russian , Dutch , Greek , Swedish , DanoNorwegian , and Hungarian . A hotel could get along if it could provide those . But still I 've been feeling lately that if you 're going to have a really efficient hotel , there ought to be people available who speak  --  here 's my list that I wrote  --  who also speak Japanese , Portuguese , which would handle Brazilians also , Czech , Arabic , Croatian , Slovene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roumanian , and Turkish . But honestly , with these , too , I tell to you I simply can not see any need of others at all , can you ? " Luciano was beaming with that naive , defenseless excitementwhich is to be found only in the well-lettered and well-bred young European , and he was gratified when Myron drawled , " No , I guess with those , any hotel could get along fairly well , though I do n't believe you should put your ideals too low ! " " Oh , yes , that is so very so ! " " Say , Luciano , remember we were talking about centralstationpower versus the hotel 's own plant ? Now I 've got some really reliable figures on the standard of steam costs per kilowatt " Splendid ! " Mark Elphinstone dropped in to inquire . Something had happened to the Old Man ; he did not chatter now , and he seemed , except for occasional glorious flashes of bad temper , not to care what happened to his hotels . He would come strutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the lad  --  how much longer you going to take a free vacation on me , heh , heh ? " and subside in an armchair by the window , looking out upon the zigzag of Broadway , and for half an hour the two men would keep each other company in silence . Then he would grunt , " Wasting time  --  wasting time  --  thought you brats were going to teach me this new stunt you call efficiency . ' Huh ! " and stump out.  | Myron believed that , in this dark valley between bright crags of industry , he had found his brother . He did not expect much of Ora now  --  though he did keep reminding himself that Ora really had paid back one of the dozen or so loans . When he had his secretary telephone to the press agent 's office where Ora worked that " Mr. Weagle was kind of under the weather " and would be glad if " your Mr. Weagle could find a moment to drop in , " Myron did not expect a response . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in his life he saw his older brother inferior to him in energy and determination , he was all friendliness . " Do n't see why you should get run down ! Nothing to do but hand out room keys and collect from the goats ! " he jeered , but it was a kindly jeer , and he actually drew up the covers  --  which Myron had just pushed down because he was too hot . " Say , old man , why did n't you put me onto this theatrical press game before ? It 's the best sport of anything I 've ever tackled . Oh , God , what we put over ! Did you see this morning 's papers about Lizette Lilydale 's engagement to the Grand Duke of Eisbeintafel-berg ? " " Yes , I noticed it . " " I 'll bet you did . Some story ! Of course she 's never seen His Blooming Highness , but why let little --  " " You mean it 's a fake ? Why , I do n't know that I entirelylike that , Ora . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly !

" " Well , sort of . " " And have n't you ever served fresh peas out of a can ? " " Not exactly  --  we call ' em green peas ' then , not fresh . ' " " Oh , how wery scrupulous , Mr. Pickwick . " " Well , I guess maybe you win , Ora . " " Look here , when the doc lets you out of this , why do n't you get away for a while ? " " Oh , I could n't . I 'll have to get right back to work " Why ? Do you think the hotel world , ' as you always call it , wo n't be able to get on without you ? Guests just be sleeping in the street ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going to organize a whole new system of chain purchasing . " " Is n't that nice ! I certainly do love to watch you kid yourself , Myron ! You really like to work , and so you do nothing else . You take refuge in it . You 're afraid of adventure , you 're afraid of facing anything unfamiliar , and so you wall yourself in with a lot of audit forms and inspectionreports . And yet you get a kick out of feeling superior to us lazy dogs , because you think you 're more industrious , when you 're simply more timid . Why do n't you , for once , let go of the hotel desk and try to swim ? jump on a ship and go to Africa ? " " Oh , that 's all nonsense ! " Myron said feebly . He wondered if it was all nonsense .   " Well , it 's none of my business . Heaven knows why I should horn in , old man . I 'm certainly sorry to see you knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Shall I bring in a couple of pretty actresses from our shop ? Like me to come and read to you ? " " Oh , thanks , no . Just want to rest . " Myron was so touched that he hinted , " By the way , kid , how are you off for money ? " " Well , I did n't like to speak of it , but --  " You 've beenso darn decent to me , and I 've been wretchedly slow aboutpaying you back , but --  " Jump on a ship and go to Africa ? No , that would be too much . But the kid was right . He had stuck too closely to his knitting . He might take a little more time off and go But where ? And it was n't so much fun to travelalone . Now if he were only married . Well . But somehow he never seemed to meet women who were not hotel employeesor guests , or to think of them otherwise than as employees or guests . What had ever become of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had left Florida , six years ago , Tansy had been blooming and , Ora understood , engaged to a man with whom she was immediatelygoing out West . Myron hoped she was well . But --  " Where did he want to go ? Why should he go anywhere ? What he wanted to do , this minute , was to get back to planning the systematized purchase of knife-cleaning machines , pilot valves , butter cuttersButter cutter , cutter butter , butter cutter , with a bath , at lowest ratesp211Oh , Lord , his head ! No , he was n't well yet , not by a long shot . He had to go away . But where ? He knew , suddenly . To Black Thread Center , to the familiar shops and friendly citizens , to the little American House where he had made his start , to the fields that would be kindly with late May when he came out of the imprisonmentof sickness , and most of all to his mother , whom he had not seen since the trip to New York he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither his father nor Black Thread in seven years . It would be , he admitted shyly , sort of fun to show off to the men he had known as kids  --  to let them know , if they pressed him , that he was making six thousand dollars a year and apartment free ! Oh , that was childish . Showing off , like a circus ringmaster . But it would be fun ! And so , for that least dignified and best of reasons , he prepared to go to Black Thread for a fortnight 's vacation . On the day he left , Mark Elphinstone called him in to bark that he was to take not a fortnight but two or three months , on pay . " That 's the only way you can get well . If you 're here where I can get my hands on you and shove work on you , I 'll do it . So you damn well stay away for at least two months ! " yelped Elphinstone . And that , Myron admitted to himself , was perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive ; it had to be , in the hotel business . It was almost too extensive , for he would never dare to appear on the streets ofp212a jeering Yankee village in the voluptuous morning coat and striped wedding trousers he had worn as a desk clerk at the Westward . Yet he bought seven new and expensive ties , white flannels and white buckskin shoes , a bathing suit , very expensive , and a vaguely useful sweater , and it can not be said that the researcher into Scientific PurchasingAccording to Standards showed himself any more scientific when he got into the hands of an uppish haberdasheryclerk than any other oaf . He stood meekly and held up the tie which the clerk had so deftly twisted and cheeped , " Yes , I guess that would look nice . " Also he bought , unscientifically , a new pigskin bag . And for his mother so many stockings , blouses , inlaid Italian boxes , fur tippets , satin dressing gowns , and canistersof imported Russian caravan tea that he had to get still another bag to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bartender , who alone was left of the American House staff that Myron had known , he needed no great storage space : he wisely took each of them nothing but a bottle of forty-year-old bourbon whisky . The Myron who entrained at the Grand Central was thirteen years older than the boy who had left Black Thread for Torrington , at eighteen . His face was far older , thinner , more lined , yet his quick step was really younger than that of the lurching rustic who had gone doubtfully out to conquer the world . He had seemed a biggish club of a lout then ; now he was a thin sure blade . He was excited as they came into Bridgeport , as , he changed cars for Black Thread , as they crept up a valley filled with May . He was grateful to Ora . He felt that hep213was entering upon an adventure , perfectly concealed from him yet greater than any other he had known . Perhaps it was that , after learning bookkeeping and fish-frying and plumbing and buying pillowcases , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let his family know that he was coming . Not expecting him , the busman at the Black Thread station , who had sat beside him for years in school , looked at this City Feller and muttered " Bus , sir ? Take your baggage ? " with a show of respect which he certainly would not have yielded to ole Myron Wiggles . His baggage he did send to the hotel , but he walked , greeting each small building  --  the paint shop that had once been a chapel , the farm-machinery warehouse , Lambkin 's drugstore , old Mr. Doane 's noble Greek residence . " There 's where I socked Herbert Lambkin with a snowball ! " he rejoiced , " and there 's  --  yes sir , by golly , it 's the same old sign  --  there 's the grocery sign we stole on Hallowe'en and hung on Prof. White 's privy ! " He had always heard that when you returned to your native-village , everything seemed ludicrously smaller and shabbier than you remembered . He did not find it so ; everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a handsome display of soaps , tennis shoes , hot-water bags , colyriums , and bottledp215pickles as Lambkin 's ? And that was a most interesting improvement : the ratty old junkshop had been torn down and replaced with a handsome new galvanized-iron potato warehouse ! He rounded the corner and saw the American House . It certainly was as tall as the Westward , so built upon with memories was it above the visible bricks . He had swept that upper balcony , he had washed that plateglasswindow , he had tacked up the netting on that screen door , he had hauled trunks out of that slanted basement entrance . And there was another Myron Weagle , a ganglingbroad-chested youth , sprinkling the sidewalk with , surely , the same battered green watering can ! Instantly he was no longer Mr. Weagle of the Westward , but the unfledged Myron of thirteen years ago . He had to work at it , to play his city-feller joke on the boy . " Hello , Cap'n ! " ( But did he really sound like J. Hector Warlock ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure , boss , come in and we 'll fix you right up . What you traveling for ? " " Trail and discovery . " " Do n't know the company . Is it a new one ? " " Yes , and probably already bankrupt . " " That a fact ? Well , that 's hard luck . Come on in and register . " Meek behind this self-confident young hotelman , Myron entered the office and beamed upon worn leather rockers , tall brass spittoons ( not polished as he 'd polished them ! ) . Behind the desk , in his shirtsleeves , sucking a toothpick and trying to play tunes on the strings of his suspenders , was his father . " Gent wants a room , " said the boy.  | " Right here , brother . Put down your John Hancock , " said old Tom , as he had been wont to say it fifty times a week , thirteen years ago . Tom whirled the register round with the familiar click . The only very modern improvementwas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of in a potato . " This is something like an inn , " Myron gloated to himself . " No signing of an elegant little card , while the clerk aims his gardenia at you ! " The old smell of tomato soup and soap and straw mattingand roast pork crept round him , instead of the Westward'sscent of marble and face powder and fur coats . He sighed contentedly as he signed the register . The old man had not looked at Myron 's face . He did not care . He had seen too many guests , and he was sixty years old now , and very gray , and the applejack wa' n't what ' t was when he was a youngster , not by a long shot ! He was uninterestedly reading Myron 's signature upside down . Then he gazed , he gaped , and whooped , " Well , I 'll be everlastingly , teetotally doggoned ! Myron ! Why , boy , I never had such a fine surprise in my life ! Come right out and see your ma . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew pants salesman ! Well , I guess maybe it 's true what they say  --  that you 're making good , and pulling down your sixty dollars a week . " His mother was basting a roast , wearing what might have been , and possibly was , the same spattered apron she had worn thirteen years ago . She straightened up , peered through crooked gold-rimmed spectacles as thoughp217she were frightened , and cried , " Why , my boy , has anythinggone wrong ? " " No ! No ! Mother ! I 've just come back for a little vacation ! " " Oh ! " She kissed him , held him off to look at him , but with all her undiminished fondness there was a rustic awe of this man who was not so much her son as a Great Successfrom the Big City . He felt that he had lost her , along with his home village ; lost all of her save her unquestioning love . He felt the tragedy of the surrendering generation , in especial the tragedy of a woman like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to managing her menfolks , old Tom and Ora and himself , so that they would not go too wrong , and had never expected anything more than halfway decencyin them , was humble before them when one of them did turn out normally competent and self-reliant . Had he been a leering failure , he might have kept her mothering intimacy ! The women who serve without knowing that they serve , or ever whining about it ! So , while he was being chatty and affectionate , he was reflecting , " I 've never done a thing for her . Ora was right ! I 've been so absorbed in making myself a swell clerk that I 've forgotten to be a human being . But I will do something for her , something fine ! " Old Tom did not suffer from obsequiousness to his son . " Well , boy , now you 're here , you better strip your coat off and help us a little . You ought to have some pretty good hotel experience by this time . I want to figure out ap218way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so doggone choosy these days . Maybe you might paint it for me . " Why , the very idea ! " Myron 's mother turned on Tom with moist , gravy-smeared wrath . " He 's not going to do anything of the kind ! Painting ! Him all tired out after all his hard work in that great , big , huge New York hotel and coming home for a rest , and then you expect him to work like a nigger ! I 'm ashamed of you ! Do n't you want to go up and lie down awhile , Myron ? " " No , I want to see the old place . Had lots of good times here ! " said Myron . " Let 's have a look at the old bar ! " Tom found this an admirable excuse to go in for a drink . As they went through the washroom to the barroom , Myron noticed that above the cast-iron stationary bowl still hung , on thin chains , a public comb , and a brush worn soft as old linen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Well , I 'm a son of a gun ! Here 's Charley Delmonicocome back to the old shanty ! Shake , boy ! Mighty proud ! " " Well , he ai n't done so much . He 's done elegant , but why should n't he ? I taught him all he knows , " observed Tom . " That 's right , " said Myron . " Say , wait just a minute . I 've got something for you boys out in my bag . " He brought in the two bottles of ripe bourbon . Jock McCreedy , tasting , rolled up his eyes , held up his hand , and murmured , " Say , Myron , that certainly makes it up to a man for all the woes and tribulations of a sinful world , like the fellow says ! "  |p219But  Tom grumbled , " Well , I suppose it 's good licker , but it ai n't got much kick . I like to have my stomach telegraphup that it 's had something stronger than diluted well water ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering that , though his mother was more beautiful than ever to him in her tragic timidity , yet Mark Elphinstone or Jock McCreedy was spiritually more his father than Tom Weagle ; Alec Monlux or Luciano more his brother than Ora ; and his tight sunless office at the Westward more his home , now , than Black Thread Center . While Tom was droning on about his expert opinions on " store whisky , " applejack , and white mule , Myron was thinking that he had paid a good deal for the privilege of helping to make a clear , efficient , merciful system out of the tangle of commerce and industry . His easy-going employeesresented him as supercilious and fussy . His old friends  --  even , he now saw , perhaps his father  --  felt that he was a hard money-grubber and climber , who had lost the pleasant sentimentality of boyhood . The " intellectuals , " like Ora , were certain that he was a vulgar Philistine , because he provided excellent bathrooms and ice cream ( which people wanted ) instead of providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . To the old friends , he was too top-lofty and intellectual . To the intellectuals , he was too low a peddler . To the peddlers , he was too scrupulous a fanatic about exact financial reports and honest advertising . " Well , let ' em all roast me . I seem to go on living through it , " he thought , and delighted Jock McCreedy by asking for a golden fizz  --  a drink in whose mixing , Jock believed , he was superior to any barman in Paris , Kokomo , Shanghai , or North Braintree . During his two months in Black Thread , while he was roaming the hills and lying in the sun and swimming in clear streams , while he was renewing acquaintance with old friends  --  or , really , while he first had the leisure to become acquainted with them at all  --  he was busy . " Mother  --  Dad  --  I 've got an idea , " he said abruptly at the family supper table , " I 've got an idea . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hush ! . . . What is it , dearie ? " said his mother . " If I 'm to carry it out , I 've got to have a free hand and no discussions . I have n't got much time here . Now listen . The new thing in travel , and in hotel patronage , is going to be automobile touring . Within another five or ten years , automobile tourists will be more important than traveling men to a hotel like this , on one of the through routes from New York to the Berkshires and Canada . But to cater to them , you 've got to have a garage , more flexible meal hours , European plan instead of American , and a betterdecoratedhouse all through . " " Rats ! " said his father , authoritatively . " Never amount to nothing , this auto touring . I was reading here just the other day where folks are getting so sick of breakdownsand gasoline stink that they 're going back to bosses . By 1916 or so , you wo n't hardly see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wrong . I 'll give you my plan , Dad . Take it or sink it , but do n't argue ! You ought to own this place , not just lease it . I 'll buy it for you , and put it inp221shape , and build a garage , financing the whole thing through the Hotel Enterprise Bureau , of New York , and we 'll lease it to a good small-town hotelman . Even with the interest on the mortgage , I think you can count , if my figures are correct , on fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars a year clear profit to live on , and then you two can rent a bungalow here , and you wo n't have to do anything but loaf . I think you deserve it , Ma , after all the years you 've worked ! " " Oh , it would be lovely to lie abed till seven o'clock every morning ! " sighed Mrs. Weagle . His father did argue , of course , and insist that he needed a few days ( which meant a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airily referred as " thinking it over . " But his mother 's nod and smile had been enough for Myron . With an hour or two a day of restful business between rather tiring spasms of devoting himself to loafing , Myron in two months carried on more activity than had gone on in the American House in twenty-four years . He hired as stenographer the smart little daughter of Reverend Snibbs , just graduated from business school in Bridgeport . That by itself , said Tom , showed Myron had got his head full of nonsensical ideas ; all his life , running this whole hotel , he 'd been able to get along by writing all the necessary letters by hand . Why ! In one single letter he 'd ordered as much as four new bureaus ! Myron dictated some fifty letters to people , all over the country , who were advertising for the lease of country hotels . While Daisy Snibbs was writing these , and for the first time the American House was echoing to the sound of any faster typing than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portable , Myron dashed down to New York , saw the Hotel Enterprise people , and apparentlycame back with assurance of finances , on a contract signed by Myron and by Mark Elphinstone . Mark had observed , " You back ? Why , damn you , Myron , I told you to get out and loaf in the sun even if it roasts your damn hide off ! Sign what ? All right , all right , do n't bother me with the details . I got hired men like you to look into those things ! " It appeared , then , that a quiet , rather shabby little lawyer from Torrington , whom Myron had known as a guest at the Eagle Hotel , had already taken an option on the American House building and plot , and that of the old livery stable behind it  --  and that he had taken it on behalf of Myron , who , with a swiftness that made his mother 's head ache and made his father almost civil for a day or two , took up the option , bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remodeling the stable into a garage ; tearing out stalls , putting in a cement floor , work bench , air pump . Other men were building behind the American House a twenty-room addition , with five baths , out over the alley and backyard , and providing for deliveries and the disposal of garbage through a truck entrance into the basement . Others were installing five new bathrooms in what had been single rooms , so that eventually the AmericanHouse would have forty-nine bedrooms and fourteen baths . A brisk little lady from a Hartford department store was looking with dislike upon the spittoons and honestold scruffy leather chairs in the lobby , the equally honest iron beds and straight chairs in the bedrooms , andp223practically , Tom mourned , throwing them away . She then , according to Tom , turned the office crazy ; in place of the straight , respectable lines of chairs along the walls , she put in a nasty mixture of wicker chairs with cretonne cushions , and leather chairs that were n't rockers , all of them in different groups , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced the lordly desk to a mere nook in a corner , and hid the key rack . And in the bedrooms she installed still other despicable wicker chairs , and painted pine bedsteads without one ornamental iron curlicue . But it was the dining room that she most disfigured . She got rid of the long , solid , satisfactory tables and put in small separate tables  --  with red tops !  --  on which , she directed , not luxurious thick cotton tablecloths but dinky little doilies were to be used ; and the wall she painted a shrieking canary yellow . When Ora ran up to Black Thread , as the work was beingfinished , he groaned , " Well , Myron , you 've certainly brought some elegant urban improvements to our hick town ! The hotel used to be just an honest country inn , that did n't pretend to be anything else , and now you 've made it into a very handsome fourth-rate imitation of a city tearoom , as kept by our best cultured spinsters ! If there are any J. Hector Warlocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a painted wicker chair and satisfy their appetites with a cream-cheese-and-jelly sandwich ! " " It 's what motorists like . And it 's comfortable and cheerful . It does n't look like the inside of a rubber boot now ! " snapped Myron . He was so vexed that this time he would lend Ora only fifty dollars . For days  --  well , for hours  --  he wondered if his new delight really was pretentious and bogus . Well , damn it , if the place did n't suit such original intellects as Ora , they need n't look at it ! And J. Hector Warlock ? Where was he ? A grand old boy ! No one had seen J. Hector for years . Jock McCreedy had vaguely heard that he had gone West and made money in mining . " I wonder , " Myron thought uncomfortably , " if J. Hector would like stripping for poker and sitting in one of Miss Bombazine 's chairs ? Well , anyway , Mrs. J. Hector would like ' em , and it 's the Mrs. J. Hectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip and the stopping places and everything else , in the motor age , and Oh , damn Ora and his damn superiority ! I 've got to hand it to his ability . He 's managed to take all the fun out of my doing this ! " The remodeling of the hotel was finished , and it was rented ( though not for a couple of months after Myron had finished his vacation ) for a sum sufficient to pay taxes , interest , and depreciation , and still give Myron 's father and mother thirteen hundred dollars a year on which to lead a life of cultured leisure . Mrs. Weagle read clear through a book by E. P. Roe ! And for all his hotel-building , Myron was devoting himself to the task of being Lazy.  |p225H  E SAW coming toward him , on his second afternoon in Black Thread , when he was wandering through the village and being edified by the information , " Well , you been away quite awhile , " a tall man who looked as though he were vigorously going somewhere but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with a high forehead , thin hair , large spectacles , and high black shoes . The man looked rather like Herbert Lambkin , but surely could not be , for Herbert was not older now than thirty-two or - three , and the man approaching looked forty . It was Herbert Lambkin , right enough . He manhandled Myron in greeting , and spouted , " It certainly is fine to see you in the old town , Myron ! I hear everything 's gone fine with you . " " Oh , so-so . " " Staying awhile ? " " Yes , a few weeks , I guess . " " Well , we must see a lot of each other . There 's nothing sadder in life than the way old friends of boyhood , comrades-at-arms , you might say , permit the currents of life to part them . We must have some good walks and talks , and try to break bread together . " " Yuh  --  yuh , sure ! " " I 'm sorry , Myron , we did n't see more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were both so busy trying our fledgling wings and I presume you are staying with your father and mother ? " " Yes . " " A splendid couple ! Such sterling characters ! " " But what are you doing here in town , Bert ? Are n't you teaching in some university ? Commencement time al-ready ? " " No , not exactly , though I 'm seriously considering one or two very flattering offers . But after I took my M.A. at Yale , in English Literature , you know , I had an irreconcilable feeling that one ought , you might say , to enter education through the foundation , if you do n't mind the metaphor , instead of just flitting in through the attic window  --  in other words , a really well-rounded educatorought first to familiarize himself thoroughly with the instruction of the child mind , so for some years now I have been superintendent of schools here  --  a position , I trust , not without some credit and responsibility , andWe were pretty wild lads in college days , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid my salad days are over , and I 'm settled down , with a wife and a couple of bonny children ! We 're planning to build an up-to-date bungalow , but just for the present my little family and I are staying with my father  --  that big , roomy house , and Father so pitifully lonely since the death of my mother , and you must certainly come and break bread with usp227there , Myron , and very soon , and I 'm sure Julia will be particularly glad to see you . I seem to remember that you were a bit sweet on her , as a young lad . " " Oh . Julia . That 's right . Your sister . Yes  --  yes , sure  --  I was quite in love with her . Ha , ha , ha ! " " Ha , ha , ha ! " " Quite stuck on her ! Ha , ha , ha ! Well , I 've got to be " " Ha , ha , ha ! That 's so . Well --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , uh , just , uh , temporarily . She married a fine fellowfrom Sharon , Willis Wood , the electrician . He is n't exactly a college man , but even so , he 's got one of the finest minds you ever encountered . He can make the mysteries of electricity so plain that anybody who runs may read ; he even makes them clear to me , though , to tell the truth , and this despite the fact that it is one of my less amusing tasks , among many others , to teach physics in high school , but what I mean to say is , I never did have a natural talent for the sciences  --  my natural bent is more artistic and literary and perhaps psychological , but Willis has a natural insight into electricity that 's simply astonishing  --  just like the grasp of commercial problems that I 'm sure you must have , old man . " " I see . Well , I 've got to be hiking on . See you later . I suppose Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just at the moment . The electrical profession has been a little overdone lately , and Willis is waiting for a new opening , and meantime he 's here in Black Thread , helping Father in the store , and he and Julia are also living with me and Father at the old home , and she has two lovely children , too  --  just lovely ! So you must come dine with us all ! " " Yes , be glad to . Well , I 've got to be skipping along . Fine to seen you . See you soon ! " Myron was too relieved at escaping from Herbert to get any particular joy out of seeing the humility of the retired Brahmin who had once considered him an Untouchable . After Herbert , it was sheer ecstasy to sit on the stone bridge and just gently , lyrically , spit in the creek . That evening , while he was defenseless in the American House lobby , Herbert descended upon him again . " Well , sir , it 's mighty nice to see your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have missed you . This town needs enterprising men like you . Why , do you know , I have n't been able to get the business men of this town interested in either the Boy Scout movement or Rotarianism , although I have ventured to give them my opinion as an educator , as a university man and a master of arts , that there are no movements that tend more to develop patriotism , good citizenship , and the social point of view than these ; so much so that it might be novel but quite sound to say that , despite the different origins of these two great spiritual awakenings , a Boy Scout is a young Rotarian , and every Rotarian is a Boy Scout in ) ong trousers ! I 've thought of presenting this perhaps somewhat original point of view in a piece for the EducationalReview , but I have been so engrossed in the cares of the poor driven educator that I have not had the time to But that 's not really what I dropped in to see you about . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our village street this afternoon , theyp229all hailed my suggestion that you must somehow be coerced into coming and breaking bread with us , and how about Friday evening , have you a date ? " " Well  --  no  --  I " Then we wo n't take no ' for an answer ! Friday eveningthen , six-thirty . You must pardon us if we merely have our customary village supper instead of the evening dinner to which I suppose you are accustomed in the great caravansaries of the Metropolis , and of course , you need not dress  --  we practically never do . " " That 's good . I did n't bring any dinner clothes . " " No need of them here at all , my dear fellow ; no need at all . There are only one or two residences in the vicinity at which it is at all customary for the household to dress , except on the most formal occasions . " ( " My God ! Bert should tell me about Black Thread Center ! " ) " So , then , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not assure you that it will be a most grateful reunion and commemoration of our happy childhood . Now there is one other thing . Uh  --  say , Myron --  The fact is : though I prize greatly the civic opportunities that lie open to the village educator , touching the minds of the Little Ones , who will later be our stalwart citizens and the pillars of the Republic , when they are still dewy and fresh , yet this great metier is not what you might call really well paid . Just between us , and I do n't want you to tell this to any of our good old friends as you encounter them in New York , but my stipend for all the toil and responsibility which I must shoulder is only sixteen hundred dollars a year ! And I must begin to consider my wife and the little ones and Now you have a great and influential position in the hotel world --  " " I have not ! I hope I may have , some day , in eight or ten years , but I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense , my dear fellow . I know you bettef than you do yourself ! I can see , just talking to you , Myron , that you have great capacity and influence , if you care to use it . I could discern that ' way back when we were boys . Whatever else I may know , I have a curious natural gift for being able to judge people 's characters on sight . I suppose that 's the key to what humble success I may have had as an educator . But what I mean to say is Nowwith all your influence in the hotel world , I wonder if you could n't put me onto a good opening where I could make better , or certainly much better-paid , use of my capabili-ties . " " Why  --  well  --  uh Just what training have you ? " " My dear fellow , a man who has cared for every detail of the lives of hundreds of children Think of what I dohere , daily , entirely aside from teaching and formulating curricula . I have to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether some poor grubby little urchin is lying to me . I have to be a really skilled technician  --  you know the natural bent I have always had for architecture , and possibly it was a mistake not to have followed that up , but I mean : I have to be no mean expert on such sordid details as heating , lighting , ventilation , an adequate supply of clean , pure drinking water and , uh , if you will pardon my being so realistic , the arrangement and conduct of toilets . And there is perhaps a yet more important factor . As I understand it , the making of entertaining yet in/formative after-dinner addresses is no mean part of the modern Boniface 's equipment , and if I may say so without boasting , it just happens , through no virtue of my own , that I seem to have the gift of oratory and , I am told , of rather witty eloquenceMyron did not get rid of him till after eleven , and he was not at all sure that he had made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Westward . Jock McCreedy , who had twice come in from the bar to try to rescue him , was very comforting . " You 've been sitting under Prof. Lambkin for two hours , kid . What I prescribe is a whisky sling . " " Jock , did you know I 'm an Eminent Boniface ? " " Well , if you are , they 're certainly making the Bonifaces a lot skinnier than when I was a young fellow . Here 's how ! " Like the streets of Black Thread Center , the Trumbull Lambkin mansion had for Myron , at first , most of its ancient awe . The side porch no longer seemed unique , but the heavy cherrywood stairs from the hall , the heavy black-walnut chairs and marble fireplace and glassed-in bookcases in the parlor still spelled for him unassailable respectability . But the Lambkins themselves , in the mere flesh , had no particular sanctity . Before he had returned to Black Thread , he had absolutelyforgotten Julia , the queen of Gibson Girls . In the two days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable sentimental excitement about her , but it dropped dead the second he stumbled up to her in the par- lor , breathed " Julia ! " and looked at her . She was a rather tall , long-faced woman , with sunken cheeks and wrinkles of anger about her eyes , and she seemed a generation older than himself . He was made nervous by the overpowering cordiality with which she shrieked , " So you thought you were going to give your old friends the go-by and not come see us , now you 're such a great success and all ! I 've certainlygot a bone to pick with you for that ! Well , Myron , it 's grand to see you  --  it certainly is just dandy ! I want you to meet my husband , and see my kiddies . . . . They were bound and determined they 'd stay up to see their Uncle Myron ! " And so she stood , a thin woman worn with housework , surrounded by her jewels : Mr. Willis Wood , a youngish male with eyeglasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children who looked extraordinarily like all other children ; and she beamed , and Myron wiggled his face with grimaces and felt melancholy and a little embarrassed . He had so often seen this same family group , with no magic for him nor even the elegance of Gibson-girlism , creeping awkwardly toward a hotel desk , wondering how much a double room would cost , and whether they could get the whole family into one room . He was painfully cordial to Willis Wood , and bubbled , " Well , I certainly congratulate you , Mr. Wood , getting this lovely bride . " ( " Grrrr ! The way she used to highhat me , damn her ! " ) " If you 'll keep it to yourself , I 'll admit I fell pretty average hard for her as a youngster , Mr. Wood ! " " Call me Willis , " croaked Willis . It was his brightest remark all evening.  |p233Nor  had the lordly Mr. Trumbull Lambkin preserved any grandeur . He had lost the selectness of gray side whiskers ; he was simply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opinion , hotel rooms in New York cost a lot of money . Herbert 's wife was a plump little woman , a nice little woman , a cheery little woman  --  in fact she was a Black Thread Center little woman . It seemed that her two sprigs also invariably called the guest " Uncle Myron , " but they had not learned that they did so well as had Julia 's kitty-witties  --  on sight of their Uncle Myron they merely giggled and fled , for which he liked them better than anyone in the room , till Effie May came in . She came from the kitchen , Effie May , Julia 's younger sister , dimpling , laughing , her softly fuzzy cheeks a little damp from cooking , and she was a Scandinavian goddess , all gold and blue and ivory , plump but light-footed , looking on Myron as ever so good a joke , looking on all life as a joke and an adventure  --  young Freya , with skin like a silver birch . " I guess you do n't remember me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's " Effie May . Is n't it just the silliest name ! " " Well , now , Effie May , it was your grandmother 's , " began Mr. Lambkin , clearing his throat as one who would a tale unfold , but he never unfolded it , for , to Myron 's entire approbation , Effie May cut him short with , " I guess I was just a brat when you firs , t went away . " " You still are ! " snarled Herbert . " How long you been gone , Mr. Weagle ? " said Effie May.  | " Thirteen years . " " Oh , then I was only seven when you left . Was I pretty terrible ? " " Well , no , I would n't say that , but I do remember your putting flour paste in my hat one time when I was courting Julia . " " Were you courting me ? " Julia was very coy about it . " I declare , I wish you 'd let me know . I 'd of waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Willis ! " " Oh , is that so ! " said Willis . " I think we can all sit down to supper now , " said Effie May . In fact she was not only the comeliest but the most sensible of the Lambkins , to Myron 's way of thinking . Between them Julia and Effie May had produced all the features with which their mother , in her lifetime , had adorned company suppers , and of which Myron had , as a boy , enviously heard from outside . There were not only the traditional Lambkin fried chicken , corn fritters , crabapplejelly , and ice cream , but the candied orange peel and brandied peaches , the last a favorite viand among teetotalers in Black Thread . But they had not arranged for much conversation . Mr. Lambkin chewed and gulped , and grumbled that the chicken was tough and that it must be pretty fine for Myron to get back home after living round in strange hotels . Herbert champed and belched and talked without stopping , but as no one particularly noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called conversation ,  |p235either  . The four children , who were supposed to be fashionablytucked away upstairs , out of hearing , hung about the landing on the stairs and yapped , " Maaaa-ma ! " And all the rest of the company , including Myron , chewed and said nothing profounder than , " May trouble you pass salt ? " Yet Myron and Effie May were talking incessantly . When Herbert slammed the table to emphasize a point  --  it was to the effect that education for children was , or possibly was not , a good idea  --  Effie winked at Myron . When Mr. Lambkin muttered to Julia something ending "  --  where did you put the toothpicks , then ? " Effie giggled softly , and her glance and Myron 's crossed . Herbert had to go down to school-board meeting for half an hour after supper ; Julia had a chance then , and Myron understood why he had been invited . It seemed , according to Julia , that Herbert had a muted affection for Myron ; that he regarded him as the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Myron 's return to Black Thread ; that he had always longed to be a hotel keeper ; and that Myron would do a favor not only to Herbert , to herself , and the entire village and township of Black Thread , but to the traveling public , if he found Herbert a tidy little job in hotel-keeping at three or four thousand a year  --  for a start . " I 'm sure any hotel owner would be awfully glad to get a man like him , with his fine education and social position and all his training in caring for children . They must have a terrible time , having to depend on ex-waiters and like that , " gurgled Julia . Myron took to himself a good deal of credit for not say/ing , " I am an ex-waiter . " He felt helpless . But as his eye roved desperately round the parlor with its forbidding wallpaper of dark red , it rested on Effie , and she dimpled sympathetically at him , and gave him strength to say brazenly , " I 'll certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York , though the business is dreadfully crowded just this minute . If I were he , I would n't give up my teaching job for a few months yet . " Effie May giggled faintly . Julia looked at her savagely and began to talk about " our old gang . " They were , it seemed , severally and collectively , a " bunch of cabbage heads . " This was married to a cat , this other was a cat herself , and the third was a vile housekeeper . Now the persons of whom Julia thus disposed were preciselythe lords and ladies of Black Thread who as princelingshad most clung about her on the archducal side porch , and whose grandeur Myron had most envied . Yet he could get no satisfaction out of hearing their former sovereign offering them up to him as sacrifices . He would not have liked it , but he would have felt that life was more integral and logical if she had snapped , " I love all my old friends implicitly , and you , you pot walloper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we consider you as fortunate even to be allowed to sit there in Mother 's old chair . " He listened miserably , and wanted to smoke  --  apparently , even at this apex of modernity , 1911 , one still did not smoke in a Lambkin parlor  --  and he escaped before the return of Herbert , although it appeared that Herbert would be agonized at missing his old chum . Effie May walked to the gate with him.  | " I 'm glad you have n't turned out a crab , like ole Julia and Bert , " said Effie May . " Do n't they love to knock ! " " You think I 'm not so bad ? " " You  --  I think you 're just won'erful ! " giggled Effie May . Won'erful , he was to learn , was her favorite word . He was delighted to find one person in Black Thread who considered life won'erful . " Look ! " he said urgently . " I 'll be just loafing around for a few weeks . Ca n't you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't we get off into the country ? " " I think that would be won'erful . Some of us kids are going to have a picnic on Lake Nekobee , next Sunday afternoon . Could you come along ? " " I 'd love to , " said Myron . And so he again walked from the Lambkin mansion to the American House , falling into love with a Lambkin daughter . " She 's twenty . Of course I 'm pretty mature . Still , at that , I 'm only eleven years older . Just right . Trained housekeeper . She certainly would be useful in checking up the housekeeping department in No ! I wo n't havemy wife working ! " reflected that mature New Yorker , Mr. Myron Weagle.  |p238THERE  was peace and healing in the hillside meadow , but no languor , so brisk were the small breezes ; and the late spring flowers among stately grasses were bits of scattered enamel  --  white and purple daisies , buttercups , red clover , and the Pompeian red of devil's-paintbrush . Myron contentedlybrushed the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay on his back , more relaxed than for years , then clasped the hand of Effie May sitting up beside him . This was good , to have a companion in the adventure of leisure . Her presence completed him . He had , in offices , in long talks with Alec Monlux and Mark Elphinstone and Luciano Mora , been so incomplete , the male without the female . And what freshness and goodness there were in the hand of this untainted girl ! He had , he meditated , been reasonably free of viciousness , and most of the guests had been good and decent , yet there had inevitably been so many others  --  the little hotel thieves , their very pettiness making it the nastier to have to deal with them , the " skippers " and passers of " rubber checks , " irritating in their angry roars of in/nocence , the suicides who so very bloodily brought shame to hotel rooms , the sneaking immoralists , and the equally unpleasant prudes who objected , publicly , to other people 's private immoralities . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 's gayety was the water of life . It would be fun , Myron exulted , to see new great things with an unjaded girl like this  --  cities and tall towers and mountains . Not much fun to have these by himself , to be unable to share them . Of course her family was a good deal of a pain in the neck , but All the more reason forsaving her from them ! . . . If he did get a hotel job for Herby , little Herby , the bounding Bert , it would be off in Alaska , with no return ticket ! ... Effie May , the poor kid ! To do things for her , to show her the world  --  yes , and to have her show it to him , with her fresher and less weary eyes , that would give some purpose to life ! " Do you ever want to travel , Effie ? " " Oh , I 'd just love to . It would be won'erful ! " " How much have you traveled ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia and Willis up to Lake Bomoseen . That was before they had to sell the car . And Papa took me to New York once for two days ; he had to go on business . My ! I wish we 'd known where you were then ; that was two years ago ; we 'd of gone and called on you ; would you have been glad to see us ? " " Would I ! You bet I would ! I 'd of shown you the whole shop , and given you a good bottle of wine . " She giggled . " That would be won'erful . But I guess wine would of been too strong for my poor little head . I never did taste it  --  except maybe some elderberry wine and dandelion wine and so on , and I just hate beer , it 's so bitter . But oh , I would of loved to of seen a really big hotel ; we stayed at a horrid poky little place , hardly any bigger than that American House Oh ! How dreadful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I agree with you . The American House is a fierce little dump . But you just wait till I finish remodeling it ! It wo n't be any Inside Inn for size , but it will be as comfy and cheerful as any city hotel . But how would you like to travel ' way beyond that ?  --  say , to Europe , and see cathedralsand castles and a lot of art galleries and so on ? " " Oh , I 'd love it ! It would be just won'erful ! I 'm just as ignorant as a rabbit , Myron . I do n't know a blessed thing about art or music or any of those things . " " Well , if you want to know , kid , neither do I ! I certainly have picked up a fine junk heap of information about electric dishwashers and combustion recorders and steel furniture , but the penalty I 've paid is that I do n't know much else . And , God , how I want to ! I want to know ! Everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My ! l always feel you know so much " I do n't . I 'm an illiterate hash hustler . And I like to learn . I wish I knew all about painting . I wish I could spiel French and German and Italian like Luciano Mora  --  he 's a fellow at the Westward ; you 'll meet him some day and fall so hard for him I 'll be jealous ! And I wish I 'd read all the poets , as Ora has . " " Well , I 'll bet he has n't  --  of course I 've only seen a little of Ora since I was a kid , but I 'll bet he 's a fourflusher ,  |p24Ilike  my own darling brother . . . . Gee , Bert never stops talking ! " " Now you look here , Effie May , that 's the first time I ever knew you to be dumb . Ora is a very intellectual fellow , with the most extraordinary imagination and originality and insight into character and so on and so forth , and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell from the way he keeps referring to them . Of course , to an old stick-in-the-mud like me , sometimes he seems pretty impractical and careless about financial details  --  I guess he 'll always be hard up and need a little help  --  but you ca n't expect a sensitive , sympathetic mind like his to stand the grind the way a hard-boiled old drudge like me does . " " I wo n't have you calling yourself names ! You are n't a stick-in-the-mud ! You get ever so much fun out of trying new stunts  --  like putting that lovely new cretonne in the American House office . I wo n't have you calling yourself names ! And let me catch Ora or Bert or anybody else doing it , and I 'll scratch their eyes out ! " He looked up at her , her golden hair of a Norse goddess glistening as she bent over him . " Would you , honestly ? " he whispered . She whispered back , " I certainly would ! " He drew her down to him . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartiness , and sprang up , crying , " Come on , silly ! We 'd better keep walking ! " They tramped over the hilltop , through the scarlet patches of devil's-paintbrush , their clasped hands swinging as though they were sixteen . In her free hand Effie May carried her old-fashioned flowery sunbonnet . Her sister Julia laughed at her for affecting anything so out-of-date and rustic , and Herbert scolded that if she was willing to disgrace herself socially by such childishness , at least , she might try to think a little of his official position , but she persisted in it , every summer  --  her only marked rebellion against the security of Black Thread Presbyterian circles . Now , when she appealed to that urban social arbiter , Myron Weagle , he assured her that there was nothing smarter than sunbonnets , as regularly worn by Van Rensselaers at Newport , and she panted with gratitude  --  and the unaccustomed walking  --  as they swung down the hillside to the Black Thread highway.  | HE ADMITTED that he was probably sentimental in seeking , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched out beside Effie May , but it had a gay sanctity for him , and there he squatted , hands about knees , broodingwhile he looked unseeing across the valley of pastures , elm groves , and quiet old yellow houses with red barns . " She 's young yet . She does n't know much . But how she will expand to the world outside ! And me , what am I going to do ? In ten or twelve years , I may be Mark 's successor , if Carlos Jaynes does n't cut my throat and convince the Old Man I 'm a small-town bookkeeper . But even that It would be just a routine job . Old Mark created the chain , and his successor would just carry it on . I 'd like to do something entirely new . " And that hour he began  --  with notes on the backs of visiting cards , transferred later to a handsome pocket vade mecum with seal binding and gilt edges , labeled , " Hotel Project Notes "  --  what must , in exactness , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , story plots , visions , observations , aspirations which he longed some day to write , not only in words but in steel and brick and compositionflooring and best-quality bed linen .

Well , then , he wanted to build , to own , and without interferenceto conduct , the one Perfect Inn ! He wanted to create it as Ora ( he supposed ) wanted to create the Perfect Poem . And since in cities the modern hotel must be a combination of inn , restaurants , whole alleys of shops , rooms that were not so much bedchambers as offices for out-of-town business men , and gathering place for conventions and public dinners and weddings ,  |p245therefore  he wanted his Perfect Inn to be in the country , by itself , altogether devoted to those blessings which no electricity or gasoline motor had made antiquated  --  perfect food and perfect wine and perfect bedrooms . Assemble the best notions of all the best innkeepers , American or European . Conceive it not as a quick and certain way of making money , nor as a happy-go-lucky fulfillment of somebody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " but as a planned , perceived , exuberantly rich yet severely chastened idea , noble as an epic and lively as a swimming race . " I 'll do it ! " Myron vowed . He sat in his rickety room at the American House till dawn , and by dawn he had filled eight pages of his handsomenew Poet 's Notebook ( only it never occurred to Myron himself to call it that ) with plans for the Perfect Inn ( and he never called his vision that , either , but only " The best resort hotel that can be built " ) . From his experience , his reading , his talk , he put down all the things to be avoided , such as the equal horrors of indolent " service " and of service that was presumptuously chummy ; and all the things to be desired , such as , since Luciano Mora was always scolding that American inns do not use the good out-of-doors , a tea and luncheon terrace , vine-sheltered and looking on sea or lake or mountain valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellenceand originality of the picnic lunch provided by Effie May . It consisted of ham and cheese sandwiches , hard-boiled eggs wrapped in waxed paper , cocoanut layer cake , rather squashed , and coffee in a thermos bottle.  | They had tramped three miles out of town , to Elm Hill , on the shore of Lake Nekobee . The hillside was thick with spruce and birch groves and a few elms , broken by pasture and meadow , and the lake , some two miles wide , was very clear , with sandy bottom , no marshy shores , and wooded hills or rolling farms all round it . There were a few flimsy summer cottages at one end , near the hamlet of East Black Rock , with its general store and two churches , but for the most part Lake Nekobee had not , in this day before the flood of motorcars , been popularly discovered . " Say , this is it ! " Myron cried suddenly when , full of hard-boiled egg and contentment , they lolled on a hot boulder above the lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.D. 1911 ) extensive coughing and a gleeful feeling of sin . " What is what ? " demanded Effie May . " This is just the place for my resort hotel . Nice hills , lovely clean lake , quiet , only three miles from the depot in town , and a hundred and twenty from New York . " " Are you thinking about a resort hotel ? " " Well , sort of . " Humbly Myron spoke of his epic . " Some day I 'd like to build the best country inn in America  --  realoutdoor place , kind of simple , and yet as good grub and service and beds as the Plaza . You see  --  oh , really take some pains , put some thought into it , profit by all the other fellows ' mistakes , and make it a corker . Do you think that would be fun ? " " Oh , yes , I think it would be lots of fun . That would be  --  it would be won'erful ! " said Effie May . And so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the general sensibleness of the whole expedition , thep247knight was ready to ride out with no more misgivings about his ability to bring back the Holy Grail . The building of even a few shore cottages along Lake Nekobee had raised land prices and when , six months later , after thinking it all over a few hundred times , Myron bought the Elm Hill property bordering on the lake , it cost him ten thousand dollars for one hundred acres  --  two thousand down , and two thousand a year . Before he had finished paying for it , the land was worth two hundred an acre .

His grandfather , a farmer , a tobacco grower from the Connecticut Valley , had started the first large dairy near Black Thread and been founder of the public library . His father , also president of the First National but dead now a year , had been an upstanding , gray-mustached old gentleman , and he had been the first man whom Myron had ever seen ridinga horse just for pleasure  --  the picture of a general on his tall bay . No Dingle in known history had worn a chin whisker or an icy eye , or foreclosed a mortgage if he could help it , or been suspected of exceeding the legal rate of interest by tacking on " inspection fees , " or shown any of the other interesting traits common to country bankers in fiction , and sometimes in real life . T. J. Dingle himself was slim , eager but restrained , with a face out of which all the slackness and fat had been carved . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young Julia had been flattered when Ted Dingle had occasionally joined her side-porch court . And if the Lambkins ( aside from Effie May ) had been inclined to believe Myron 's assertion that he was only a small valve in the Elphinstone engine  --  as doubtless they would have , as soon as they got used to the sight of him  --  they would have been kept respectful by viewing the new friendship of Myron and T. J. Dingle . When Myron went into the bank to cash a check , the third day of his visit , Dingle insisted on his coming into the private office , struggled a little with remarks about the weather , and abruptly invited him to dinner  --  his the only house in Black Thread that had the affectation of evening dinner . Myron found that the dolorous old green-and-brown Dingle Mansion , with its high cupola , had been made almosttolerable with white paint and the removal of the scrollwork above the porch ; the gloomy rooms had been brightened , and filled with books and flowers . Dingle 's young wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housedresses , playing the piano , and making Lobster Newburgh , all excellent habits . Sitting with them , in the first easy household he had found in Black Thread , Myron realized that T. J. Dingle was at once shrewder and morep249cultivated than anyone he had met since he had left home  --  except perhaps the supercilious Carlos Jaynes of the Elphinstone organization , who managed to combine Pan Dandy Lunch Rooms and dislike of Myron with devotion to Brahms and El Greco . It seemed to Myron a little strange that his two intimatesin his boyhood town should not have been his own family , or Herbert Lambkin , or any of the lively ruffians with whom he had once loafed at the livery stable , but two familiar strangers whom , as the baby Effie May and the aloof Ted Dingle , he had seen without knowing them . And it came to pass that at least one evening a week , while the Maison Lambkin fluttered more and more unctuously , Myron and Effie May spent with the Dingles , and had thus a social recognition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into marriage . He never did propose . It is , indeed , doubtful whether anybody in history , outside of novels , ever has really " proposed . " They simply came to know that they liked each other and excited each other and that , presumably , they were going to be married . They were walking by the river in that last light of an early summer afternoon when the trees stand up like pyramids of green light and the world is content to slumber . He held her hand to his breast , stroking it , and trembled , " I guess  --  it kind of looks  --  it looks as if we 'd be married . Let 's be married in a fortnight , and run off to Canada or Maine or some place , before I have to get back to work.  | ... We 'll have a lovely suite in the Westward , and I 'll make Mark redecorate the bathroom with marble floor and colored tiles and a shower , besides the tub . " " A suite ? That would be awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big New York hotel like that  --  it would be perfectlywon'erful ! " said Effie May . And so Myron did have to send hastily to New York for his morning coat and striped trousers and four-in-hand and have Luciano Mora take a chance on getting him a silk hat of the right size  --  his first silk hat , and he wore it to theaters four times the first year , twice the second year , never at all afterward . They were married at the Presbyterian Church with ( to Myron 's mild astonishment ) bridesmaids , flower girls , Ora as best man , and T. J. Dingle , Luciano Mora , and Herbert Lambkin as ushers . Julia had a perfectly won'erful time weeping , and informingthe world that she had to be mother to " poor little Effens , " and Myron had never so loved Effie as when he overheard her snarling to Julia , " Oh , for God 's sake cut out the mothering and find my darn garters ! " And Myron had a perfectly horrible time . He ardently hated everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luciano , Dingle , and Ora . He had started in hatingOra , also , for it was just the day after Ora had informed him that his remodeling of the American House had turned it from an honest inn into a gifte-shoppe . But this morning , at the church , when he was riding hard on Myron in the parlors till the bride should have come up the aisle , Ora reestablished himself by producing a pint of rye ,  |p251ordering  Myron to have a sip , and grunting , " Well , I never thought any Lambkin would ever crawl out from under the rocks  --  God , that Herby is a stiff !  --  but your Effie May is a peach ; pretty as Lillian Russell , and a jolly kid . Congratulations . And I have got the damn ring all safe , right here ! There they come ! Hey , hey ! Keep your nerve ! One more quick swig !

He began , now , the second half of his life , as he squeezed her hand and muttered , " My wife ! " " Ouch ! " she said , and giggled , and he glowed like a cat on the hearth . Item in the Hotel Era : BONIFACE A BENEDICTGreeter Myron S. Weagle , long one of the right-hand men of Mine Host Mark Elphinstone of the Westward Ho ! , in the Big Town , and formerly Boniface of the Tippecanoe Lodge , Fla. , than whom none among the younger hoteliers is better known for dispensing lavish hospitality and for postprandial eloquence , has let himself in for the chime of merry wedding-bells , the fortunatelady being Miss E. Laski of Thread Mill Center , Massachusetts , and the lucky couple are now spending their honeymoon in the golden isle of Bermuda . Blazing white reefs , white-edged breakers , deep waters that shaded from stainless green into pure blue , plaster houses white and pink and yellow among dark cedars ,  | gardens of palm and banana , the creak of an old barouche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made no difference where they were going or whether they ever went there  --  late-summer Bermuda , and Myron and Effie May honeymooning , and discovering , both of them , their first foreign land . That the shops should sell coral and mother-of-pearl , and herringbone heather just come from London ; that the policemen should have an English accent and the postmen wear funny hats ; that they should dine in a garden of oleanders and roses ; it was all a fairy tale that made up for the tragic honeymoon discoveries that she was likely to giggle at his enthusiasms over nondripping hotel teapots and folding baggage stands , that she liked to eat chocolates in bed , with the results that she made nasty brown daubs on the pillows and afterward had the most indelicate fits of indigestion ; that he made horrid noises in the bathroomand wore long thin cotton-and-wool underwear instead of this jaunty new " athletic " sort , and that neither of them had had enough experience of love-making to do it gracefully . But she did warm his heart by regarding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in Florida and Missouri , she happily assumed that he knew everything about reefs , tides , deep-sea fishing , wisteria , planter 's punch , the intimate biology of the coral Anthozoa , the varieties of palms , the constitutions of the several British colonies , the social life of the governor of Bermuda , and the productivity of banana plants . And he told her everything , to their mutual satisfaction . Few of the great hotels which were later to makep253Bermuda , next to Paris , the most agreeable suburb of New York had yet been erected , but they stayed at a shiny pink-and-blue inn between Harrington Sound and the open ocean , and so agreeable was it to sit out under the cocoanut palms after dinner , or at teatime , with hot butteredEnglish scones and marmalade in stone jars , that Myron 's concept of the Perfect Inn grew and kicked and crowed  --  doubtless the more so because he had never dared expose it to the snicker of Ora . It would take years for him to accumulate the necessary money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create this right and beautiful thing and it would be his excuse for having lived . So they came back to New York and to work , looking a little regretfully from the boat deck of the steamer along the nickeled wake to the bright reefs of Bermuda.  | FROM 1911 to 1926 , from his thirty-first year to his fortysixth , Myron was busy about this hotel and that in New York City and Philadelphia and Long Island and Wilmington , except for eight months in 1917 and 1918 , when he was a captain in the Quartermaster 's Department , saving the world by sitting in a warehouse in New York and buying blankets and bacon and beans . He never lost his fantastic notion of the Perfect Inn , but each year he felt that he was not yet ready , and he had to content himself with filling new volumes of his little books of " Hotel Project Notes . " What is an art , what is a profession , what is a business , what is a job ? Is a man who runs a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the gr. dept of Macy 's just a business man , while anybody who makes smart pictures of girls is artist , and doc or lawyer who thinks about nothing but making money a professional and cranky old prof who goes on handing out same lecturesyr after yr a scholar and not just on a white collar job ?  |p255Myron  did institute new methods as purchasing agent for the whole Elphinstone chain . Till now , the stewards and other buyers even for great hotels had not been so very different from Tom Weagle , whose system of purchasingfor the American House had been to stamp into the local butcher shop and drone , " Wacha got today ? That legga lamb any good ? " But Myron and other pests of his kind made the whole process as delicate and complicatedas determining the weight of Saturn . After three and a half years he was made chief assistant to Mark Elphinstone , to help direct all the hotels and restaurants , with the title of third vice-president of the company . Mark himself never told him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the position , which was really that of heir-apparent to the throne of the little Napoleon . Carlos Jaynes , now resident manager of the Westward , had fought sharply for it . Though Elphinstoneowned more than half the stock of the company , the millionaire brother-in-law of Jaynes and his friends controlledover forty per cent. , and they had supported Jaynes . Myron had won , though Mark 's latest secretary , a young Y.M.C.A. man named Clark Cleaver , told him that the Old Man had been gambling on the market , and might have to sell some of his stock in the company . But Myron forgot his precariousness in working out life with Effie May , in accumulating plans for the Perfect Inn , and , after the comparative simplicity of being purchasing agent only , in the whirlwind of dealing with every sort of detail of every sort of hotel and restaurant.  |p256Every  detail of hotel-keeping  --  and J. Hector Warlock had been right , years ago , when he had instructed the young Myron that a hotel keeper had to be a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , architect , dietitian , garbage handler , ventilalationengineer , lawyer , orchestra director , psychiatrist , florist , guide to the city , state , nation , and all hotels in Switzerland , the Argentine , and South Africa , garage manager , after-dinner speaker , and supreme expert on insurance , taxes , depreciation , and amortization . Insol prob of hotelman matter of " morals . " To what extent should he let all guests do exactly what they like so long as pay bills , not disturb other guests , &; not get hotel bad reputation  --  couples probably unmarried , strange gents possibly fugitives from justice , even degenerates . Luciano Mora insists hotelman no more right censor than physician refuse treat immoral or criminal patients ; he says would you excuse Methodist hotelman if refused take in Jewish , Catholic , Buddhist , or atheist guests . Alec says , yes , but immoral guests so-called , sooner or later get joint bad name gradually even if at 1st no one kick . I do n't know . Guess will be slack enough to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " immoral " unless made to by kicks . Every sort of detail of every sort of hotel  --  the details that the guest , interested only in his soft bed and his dinner , never knows.  |p257Carlos  Jaynes suggested that , though for their Buffalo , Worcester , Akron , Hartford , and Scranton houses English menus were all right , it would give what he called " cachet " to the Westward to have the menus , at least in the Georgian Dining Room , in French . On the sample which Jaynes submitted , Myron found the item , " Le ham and eggs . " Now that was perfectly sound , for had Jaynes not taken it from the menu of the Savoy Grill , in London ? Myron sent Jaynes ' memorandum up to Mark Elphinstone , with one of his own : " This seems an elegant idea , only I think the item I have checked should be in more idiomatic French and read Le ham et eggs . ' It certainly would make a regular guest out of any Kansas buyer to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , y los wheat cakes avec der maplesirop instead of just plain grub in our shop . " That was enough . Myron 's chief crusade , as Elphinstone 's shadow and later as a manager on his own , made him unpopular among his successful colleagues , for it was against undue reverence for publicity and for what was called " service . " He had a theory that however much the lonely guest , unused to hotels , delighted in being pumphandled by clerks and assistant manager , called by name by the doorman , and entertained by the meteorological discussions of the bellboysand elevator runners , there were just as many guests , veterans of travel and of hotel-living , who wanted to be let alone ; who , safely away from the excessive attention and domestic discussion of Home , enjoyed being invisible . And such guests , he believed , resented such bids for pub- licity as the flourish with which a celebrated maitre d'hotel , boomed as " official taster , " tasted every dish to be served at a large banquet , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell well-done terrapin from over-roasted canvas-back ; and such guests were irritated by a wild hurrah about having the more expensive suites accurately decked out with " period furniture . " ( " Just the same , Ora was wrong about my putting too much tearoom agony into the American House when I remodeled it . Well , maybe he was n't quite as wrong as I thought then , four years ago ! " ) Invariable courtesy , swift fulfilling of orders , honest conferencesof department heads as to what guests really wanted  --  Myron did not see why these obvious necessities of hotel-keeping should be trumpeted forth as extraordinary , or why a tired and dusty guest , already jumpy over being made conspicuous by the room clerk 's caroling " Boy ! Take Mr. Jones up to 755 , " should be forced to admireplacards reading approximately : " Look at how tenderly we care for you , and notice us , please notice us , and do n't forget that whether you use talcum powder or not , there is a nice free can of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest who had made a large night of it , and was doubtful whether he would last till breakfast , should be compelled to listen on the telephone to a birdie chirp of " Good-morning , this is roo-oom service , I shall be pleased to take your order " before he could snarl his needs . He did not see why a guest who had been perfectly contented with his room and breakfast should be compelled to think up a polite answer to repeated and patently mechanical inquiries as to whether everything was allp259right . If everything were n't all right , Myron suspected , the guest would let the management know ! He wanted good food , a comfortable bed , a comfortable chair with a good light for reading , quick service on laundry and clothes-pressing and mail , accurate answers to his questions as to how to get about the city , but  --  or so Myron insisted to his colleagues  --  he rarely wanted to be motheredor brothered or wet-nursed , nor did he yearn to give information about the health of his Little Ones either to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old-fashioned tavern keeper , before 186o , used to enjoy being boss under his own roof , and bawling out anybody who did n't take a shine to dirty beds and greasy food . The new-fashioned one enjoys feeling what a gent he is , to be so kind to strangers for whom he obviously does n't personally care a hang . Both are bad , and neither has anything to do with providing good beds and grub at a fair price , " said Myron in a speech at a convention of the Hotel Greeters , and for such heresy , such red revolution , he was penalized all his life . . . . As well inform a conventionof city specialists owning $3,600 motorcars that they are not necessarily more clever than the country doctor in a second-hand flivver ! He was so much a crank as not to be much edified by such texts in elevators as " Daily Message to Guests and Staff : If you have friends in every place , in every place you will find charm , " or " To employees : Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " This , in a fifteen-hundred-room hotel where nobody save a centipede could feel at home ! And it occurred to Myron that a fair number of guests might be so earnestly sick of wives ,  |p26o  yelping children , solicitous mothers-in-law , balky furnaces , household bills , trouble with cooks , and getting the lawn mowed that the one reason why they came to hotels at all was to get away from feeling at home . Over this greeting-card philosophy Myron had his chief differences with Mark Elphinstone . He admired the Old Man , loved him like a son , but Elphinstone would scribble and gloat on and have printed a torrent of profoundaphorisms that did n't mean anything . Among his deeper and more moving revelations were : The heart of a hotel is its kitchen ; the Front Office its nervous system . Hotel success is a mathematical formula : cooperation plus pep . Do n't be stingy with towels . For every guest that asks for one more there is another that requires one less . A modern hotel is like an automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one can be neglected . If the boy in the washroom is n't on the job , the chief clerk in the come-to-Jesus collar ca n't function . A hotel is the weary traveler 's temporary home and his room is his castle . As the fourth or fifth largest industry in the United States , hotels proudly take their rightful place in the nation'seconomic solidarity . A smile of welcome from behind the desk is like a beacon to a mariner at sea . Adam was the first hotel keeper . " Yes , and what of it ? " snapped Myron , as the messages fluttered on his desk , on forms with " Elphinstone Servicep261Snappers " printed in red at the top . Well , Elphinstone was otherwise an excellent boss . There were hotel proprietorswho used morphine or read paragraphs from Elbert Hubbard aloud or wanted their pictures in the papers or expected you to make engagements for them with pretty women guests . " And maybe I 'm all wrong , anyway . Maybe I 'm too much opposed to handshaking and mottoes as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inn-keeper . " He was wrong . His worst fault as an innkeeper was his inability to be more than commonly civil and attentive , ever to be an unctuous foot-kisser , to overdemanding guests , even when they were Celebrities . One of the dramas of his trade was the reception of Celebrities  --  Senators , Generals , circumnavigatory aviators , prize fighters , diplomats , explorers , foreign lecturers . Some of them did not consider their visitations so great a favor that they expected to have accommodations free , and there were even rare souls who did not want publicity and did not expect the hotel press agent to let the newspapers in on the secret of their presence . But there were others who expected not only Carlos Jaynes and Myron to be awaiting them in the lobby , with an entourage of clerks , porters , bellboys , the press agent , and a corps of reporters and photographers , but that Mark Elphinstone himself ( they always had a card to him ) should devote a day to the pleasure of giving them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmly they strode from the taxi into the hotel ! How surprised they were to be interviewed ! How modestlyp262they explained they knew nothing about politics  --  and then proved it ! How reluctantly they sipped of what they believed to be Mark 's private stock of bourbon  --  it was a private stock , right enough , but not the sort he drank . How buoyantly they said , of a private suite priced at thirty dollars a day which they were getting for ten , " Oh , this is quite all right . It will do very nicely  --  very nicely ! The price is a little steep , but I am sure I shall be very comfortable . " And you had to send them flowers , and a bushel of fruit . Fortunately , you could sometimes get these from the leftovers of last night 's banquet . And just as hard to swallow as the Celebrities who expectedyou to telephone about them to city editors  --  who would growl , " Who the hell is he ? What 's he got to say ? My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  were the other , usually more authentic Celebs who really wanted to be let alone . When they crossed the Atlantic , they kept their names off the passengerlist , in the touching belief that no one would know they were coming , though the London or Paris correspondentshad cabled of their coming before they sailed . Down on these unfortunates , the reporters came via the transom , the keyhole , the fire escape , the fireplace , or just generally through the air , and the Celebs blamed the hotel management ; they always said , " I did think that You People might be trusted to make at least some slight effortto respect my wish for privacy ! " After a Celebrity , Myron appreciated a sound and seasonedtraveling man.  |p263Conventions   --  oh , God , conventions ! As restaurant and banquet manager , Myron had had to make love to lodge secretaries and committee chairmen to persuade them to hold their dinners at the Westward . Now , as assistant to the president , he had to back up the several resident managers of the hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nightmare of being forevercaught in a subway rush . There is an Elphinstone hotel , let us say , in the city of Golden Glow , which is distinguished for being the dirtiest and noisiest industrial huddle in the state of Winnemac . Now the state organization of shoe dealers , autograph collectors , petunia growers , Schnauzer fanciers , pacifists , big-navyists , wholesale and retail tripe dressers , or alumni of Pettifoot Military and Agricultural Institute are going to hold a convention . The Golden Glow Chamber of Commerce , together with the hotel keepers , theater owners , taxicab owners , and the like of the city , send letters , telegrams , and emissaries to the committee to proclaim the beauties of Golden Glow  --  the park system , the almost radioactive drinking water , the extraordinary situation whereby Golden Glow can with equal ease be reached from Key West , Medicine Hat , or Constantinople , the number and vehement luxury and unparalleled cheapness of the hotels , the rural grandeur that the Golden River will have as soon as a couple of hundred factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim splendor of Mount Glow , which is only fourteen thousand feet lower than Mount Whitney , and the acoustics of Memorial Hall , in which twenty thousand people can hear the lowest whis/per , provided listening to low whispers is their notion of fun . The convention once secured , the hitherto chummy hotel keepers separate and begin trying to get reservations away from one another . Then the convention . The arrival of kings , field marshals , and archbishops , each expecting suitable reverence : the president of the state organization , the secretary , the chairman of the committee on meetings , the chairman of the accommodations committee , the chairman of the banquetcommittee . Delegates flooding in , demanding the rooms they have forgotten to reserve . Lobbies jammed with men slowly circling and exchanging remarks , flasks , and chewing gum , and agreeing that a three-hundred-room hotel which can not take care of two hundred extra guests at the last moment is not enterprising , and they certainly will never come here again ! Secretaries of committees , sitting at small desks in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them that they become deaf and blind , and are sometimes found weeks afterward , hidingunder the pile of unanswered messages . And his incessant problem of employees . Myron had been an underling himself ; he had vowed then that if he ever became an executive , he would never be irritated , that he would tenderly instruct all the employees , and be delighted to advance money to them in the middle of the week . He still felt that he ought to feel so . He did n't . He still had an uneasy sense , probably derived from Ora , that he ought to be a socialist , a comrade to all the workers.  |p265He  was n't . There had been so many instances when the " help " had failed him : the cook who showed up drunk for the preparation of Thanksgiving dinner ; the bellboy , supposed to be hustling an urgent message up to a guest , who was found smoking a cigarette and playing craps in the linen room ; the steward who was taking a percentage from the provision merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four ; the chambermaid who , ordered to wash the flyspecks from one electric globe , did not wash the other dirty globes in the room ; the elevator runner who sneered at funny old women with purple hats -- Ahundred of them daily . Yet Myron was a reasonably just and kindly man , and he fretted over his workers . He had no pleasure in kicking out even the surliest of them . If day on day they worried lest they lose their jobs , so day on day he worried , " Oh Lord , have I got to fire him ? " as he watched a man growing slack , doing less work , and no employee had more sternly to nerve himself , to still his quaking stomach , before edginginto the Boss 's office to ask for a raise , than did Myron before sending for an employee to scold him . It was hard on an employee , he admitted , to be dependent , for the job that meant life for himself and his family , upon the whims of a boss who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair ; to give all his laborious days for the profit of some absentee owner whom he had never even seen . " Just the same , as long as it 's my job to control them , I 'm going to drive ' ern as hard as  --  as hard as I 've always driven myself , " he insisted . After the Bolshevik Socialist revolution , and the in- stallation of the Fascists in Italy , he was interested to learn that , under these new systems , slackers and dullards and falsifiers of reports were worse driven  --  even to prison or the rebuke of an automatic  --  than under the Capitalistic Democracy which , with no particular will or thought in the matter , he himself represented . The coming of Prohibition , which was annoying to most citizens , was a catastrophe to the hotels . They had depended upon the bar to pay , at least , rent and taxes , and it had enabled them to lose on the dining room , to lavish game , terrapin , caviare on the guests and positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table more butter than they needed , and if the meals brought a deficit , what of it ? It was good advertising . With Prohibition , they were compelled to turn niggardly or close their doors in bankruptcy . Myron had for a while to return to his foodcost-findingand determine exactly what proportion of an ounce of butter could be given to each guest without loss ; just how much , to the tenth fraction of a cent , they could spend on an egg . And with the loss from Prohibition , taxes went up . Hotels and theaters are always excellent institutions to tax , when in doubt . Rural legislators live decently at home , or in boarding houses at the capital ; they go neither to hotels nor to theaters and see no reason why other people should ; and in framing taxation bills always agree that these lairs of luxury will stand another raid . Income taxes have always been an especial delirium to hotels . A factory can strike a reasonable average for depreciation of machinesand plant ; but so varied is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate the annual damage . Such an agreeable fad as stealing souvenir spoons , springing up mysteriously and ragingly , will suddenly cost a hotel thousands a year , to be more or less allowed for on the income tax , provided the inspectors of tax reports condescend to permit it . It was particularly pleasant for hotels to pay extra taxes to support extra prohibition agents for the purpose of keepingthem from earning the extra taxes , and just as pleasant to realize that , privately , the guests were drinking as much as ever , with the difference that the hotels received none of the profit , while the merry men , communally guzzling in their bedrooms instead of the bar , were ruining varnishedtables and bureaus with spilled alcohol and cigarettesleft burning , were setting beds and chairs and curtainsafire , were throwing empty bottles out of windows upon the heads of litigious passers-by , were keeping other guests awake , for which only the hotel was blamed ... . It scarcely seemed worth while to pay much extra income tax to get these results . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the soul of Myron Weagle , poet , then is the seeming wrong , for it was with such details that he had to harass himself , it was for them that he had to give up leisure and love and play , all the years after 1917 . Ora , engaged in ghosting the memoirs of a charming lady blackmailer who had driven half a dozen men to suicide , complained that for all of marriage and Bermuda , Myron was less adventurous and picturesque than ever , unfit for the reverence of a novelist like himself , who would have liked an explorer or a soldier for brother . Effie May , left alone for a good part of the time , and now less entertained by the luxury of hotel suites , complained that Myronwas neglecting her . Carlos Jaynes complained that the crank , Myron , with his dirty little insistences on economy , kept him from makingthe public rooms of the Westward as smart as those of the Ritz or Plaza or St. Regis . Even Mark Elphinstone complainedthat Myron criticized his ideas for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romance , Myron warmed in his heart the desire to create the Perfect Inn . He was the inventor , or one of the inventors , of the " emergency overnight kit " for people held too late at the office to get back to the suburbs . It contained cotton pajamas , cheap comb and toothbrush , a small tube of toothpaste ; it was given free to sober-looking guests who were benighted , and led several hundred business men to making a habit of staying at the Westward . Also , as they were supposed to leave the pajamas behind , to be launderedand used over again , it did not cost so much as it seemed . Ora laughed enormously when he heard of Myron 's invention . It was , he pointed out , a perfect example of what a modern American business man considered an advance in civilization , and he had the funniest suggestions ( Effie May giggled at them ) for other items to be included in the kit : a paper-bound copy of the Gospel According to St. John , a celluloid sardine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collection of the poems of Edgarp269Guest , pink wool bed socks , and an eighteen-foot telescope so that the guest could study astronomy from the lofty altitudes of the Westward . Myron argued with Carlos Jaynes and the other resident managers about extra attention to traveling men and samplerooms . Jaynes had figures  --  like all statistics very impressive but rather vague as to origin  --  to prove that in 1922 there were , thanks to catalogues and larger wholesalers , only fifty per cent . as many drummers on the road as in 1902 , and he hinted that Myron could not get away from the psychology of Black Thread Center of 1895 . Perhaps that was all true , said Myron , but traveling men were the most important of all critics of hotels . It was they who remarked , in the smoking compartments of trains , " Going to Golden Glow for the first time ? Try the Smith Hotel . They treat you right . All new mattresses , and the clerks make sure you get your mail , and the coffee  --  ummmm ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Hotel Royal Magnificent is any good . You take my tip and give it a miss . They got enough gilt in the lobby to sink a ship , but if you take a room for anything under six bucks a day , they treat you like a poor relation , and they stick you fifty cents for orange juice . Out ! " So Myron outraged Carlos Jaynes , bewildered Effie May , and shocked Ora by insisting that every employee give more attention to the veteran traveling men than to Neapolitan dukes who came in brushing off reporters , and in particular he did so after a day in 1923  --  though then he was no longer at the Westward.  | He was behind the desk , checking over the credit-card rack , the telautographs , the transfer racks , the mailstampingmachine , the three fire-alarm systems , the time clock , and the other complicated contrivances of that nerve center of the hotel . Up to the desk to register came a man foggily familiar to Myron ; a tall , stooped man , neat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn , his gray hair bushy at the edge of his cocky gray hat . He was , Myron guessed , a Failure , but a Failure who would never give up his flamboyant hopes . A man of sixty or sixty-two ? Now who the devil was he ? Myron seemed to associate agreeable , even exciting memories with him . Elbowing the room clerk aside , he read the signature upside down . That signature was " J. Hector Warlock , Chi . Benjamin Belt Buckles the Best . " Myron was within an inch of saying " Number Four , as usual , Mr. Warlock ? Mr. Dummy Dumbolton is in the house . " But Dummy Dumbolton , meek and bewildered and admiringto the end , was dead now . And the J. Hector Warlockwho , at thirty-four , could stay up all night drinking and gambling , and still laugh in the morning , was just as dead . Myron was silent . J. Hector looked straight at him , unrecognizing , his kind eyes a little bleary . He was rumbling , and his rotund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brother , do you happen to have a nice room for about three-fifty ? " " We certainly have , Mr. Uh  --  " Myron pretended to look at the registry card . J. Hector 's script was as bold asp271ever , but shaky on the down strokes "  --  Mr. Warlock . Three-fifty exactly , and I think you 'll like it . Uh  --  BenjaminBelt Buckles , eh ? How are they going ? " " Oh , pretty good . " Then J. Hector laughed , threw back his head with his old gesture of a matinee idol . " That means pretty damn bad ! " He looked away from Myron , awaiting a bellboy , and Myron could not think of another question . He longed to bring back 1895 , and credulity , and delight at the strangeness and variousness of life , and the round cheeks and mighty laugh and black locks of J. Hector . He nodded to the boy . " Take Mr. Warlock up to 539 . " He watched J. Hector bob wearily across to the elevator , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer under observation . He vanished behind the elevator grille , bearing with him Myron 's youthful certainty that somewhere in the beautiful world was to be found a blessed state called " success . " To the room clerk Myron murmured , " Just charge Mr. Warlock three-fifty for 539 , and put the rest on my bill , and make a memo of this : Whenever he comes , he 's to have any six- or seven-dollar room , the best that 's vacant , for three-fifty . Charge the excess to me , and do n't let him know , understand ? " He was called to the telephone at once with , " The gentleman in 539 wants to speak to you , Chief . " " Is this the clerk that assigned me to 539 ? " J. Hector 's voice was quavering , a little frightened . " Yes . " " Well , look , old man , sorry to bother you , but are you sure this is a three-fifty room ? " " Yes , absolutely ; that 's right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid --  Hate to be a tightwad , but you know how it is ; firm just wo n't stand for more than that on the expense account . " " Sure , I know how it is , Mr. Warlock . We like to cater to traveling men here . " " Well , I 'm glad to hear that . I 've been a drummer for more'n forty years , and nowadays it seems like most of these young glad-handers would rather have a bootlegger or a beautiful young movie actor guy than to have an oldtimesalesman that has to watch the nickels . Used to be a time I could blow myself to a six-dollar room , but somehow , nowadays Oh , excuse me ; you do n't want to hear my troubles ! Much obliged , Cap'n ; sorry to bothered you ; sure am much obliged . " Myron felt old that night , and Effie May , prattling about the play to which they were going , seemed embarrassinglyyoung . He wanted to get hold of J. Hector for a poker game . But  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater , after being alone all day . He liked novelties in food well enough , but when the manager of the Westward lunchroom innocently proposed a sandwich made of pineapple between halves of a doughnut , he forbade the crime without right of appeal . . . . And the question of the commercial value of a free basket of fruit in bedrooms ; or could they sell such baskets , for fifty cents ; or was the whole thing just an unprofitable extra bother ? . . . And the comedy of the expansive gentleman who , after having a suite and vast meals for a week , so that the cash drawer rattled with anticipation , paid for it with due-bills given for advertising . . . . And the growingp. 273importance of cafeterias and coffee shops , as against the fact that the hasty gobbling of fodder in such places killed the tradition of leisurely dining . . . . And the question of how to provide amusement for lonely guests in the evening ; how many liked a phonograph  --  later , a radio ... Lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for guests . . . . The press agent of the Westward , who pestered the officers by turning the whole hotel over to wedding parties , so that Myron , howevermuch that sentimentalist loved young love , was sick of dying flowers , dribbling champagne glasses , and weeping relations , who savagely stopped weeping when they had to pay the bills . . . . The newspapermen who blamed a thousand-room hotel because it served more stereotyped food and had more standardized bedroom furnishing and less quaint , jolly , rubicund , Dickens-cum-Chesterton " characters " than an " old-world " inn of fifteen rooms and twenty seatings at table , as conducted by a famous retired chef who managed every detail . . . . The unhappy fact that , devoted to efficiency just as an impersonal ideal , Myron was as irritated by sloppiness and ignorance in rival hotels as in his own . To see on a table an ashtray filled with cigarette butts , unnoticed by the waiter , was to him what it was to a Black Thread deacon to catch the preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  except , perhaps , a guest 's marking on a linen tablecloth with a pencil . If he had no formal religion , nor gave any particular thought to his chances of heaven , he did believe in hell almost literally when he saw such a guest ; and an otherwise perfect journey could , for a quarter-hour , be ruined by a crooked tablecloth . He could see more things wrong with an apparently well-conducted restaurant in two minutes than the crankiest guest in as many hours . He did not approve of himself for being so irritated by incompetence that it clouded the glory of life . He knew that he was " fussy . " He could scarcely avoid knowing it , with Ora and Effie May about . All these details were so unimportant , they told him . Yet to Effie May the health of her brother and sister and father , an extraordinarily indifferent matter to the world at large , appeared to be important , and equally so the scent of her perfume , a pebble in her dancing slipper , or runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the word " delectable , " the good harsh sound of words like " grackle " and " grunt " and " starve , " the crime of dependingin stories upon roses , sunsets , and mother love , and the not uninteresting question as to which magazines paid better seemed weighty matters . Sappy little truisms on red-and-green placards  --  the demandsof Celebrities  --  emergency overnight **36;2143;TOOLONG  --  unemptied ashtrays  --  Myronadmitted that none of these atrocities singly much affected history , yet all together , he still insisted , they made the difference between doing his job excellently and doing it badly , and that to him was urgent . The unfortunate thing is that though men have general resemblances in love , hunger , patriotism , and noses , they differ utterly in the technicalities of their work , and each grieves that all the others are idiots not to understand his particular language . Hotelman or sculptor or sailor orp275manufacturer of tacks , each has a separate and selfconsciousworld , with a certainty of its significance to the universe , of the towering dignity of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , to outsiders , seem indistinguishable " types . " To most guests at the Westward , every waiter looked like every other waiter , and a bellboy was merely a bellboy , but to one another , and to Myron Weagle , they were as different as Albert Einstein and John L. Sullivan , and all of them more reasonable and comprehensible than either Mr. Einstein or Mr. Sullivan . Each world has not only its technicalities but its own heroes . To Myron real history had nothing to do with Charlemagne , Moses , Garibaldi , Goethe , Thomas Edison , or Abraham Lincoln  --  except as Edison invented the lights that were so useful to hotels , and Lincoln took out an innkeeper 's license in Sangamon County in 1833 . For him the rulers of history were the greater American hotel keepers : David Reynolds , the Boydens , Barnum ( not P. T. , but David , of the Indian Queen Tavern in Baltimore ) , Nathaniel Rogers , Cornelius Vanderbilt  --  until he gave up conducting the Bellona Hotel in New Brunswick for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who also abandoned innkeeping at the Bull 's Head Tavern , on the Boston Post Road , for the vanities of railroad-financing , Rathbun , the Leylands , Paran Stevens , Potter Palmer , Oscar , Boldt , the two generations of Drakes , Statler , Muschenheim , Fred Harvey , Bowman , Boomer , Simeon Ford , Ralph Hitz , Willard , Flagler , Eppley , Ernie Byfield . To him , these names were as familiarand significant as the names of Dickens and Walter Scott to Ora . And to none of these masters , insisted Myron , when he defended himself against the scoffing of Ora or the incomprehension of Effie May , would an unemptied ashtray be unimportant ! There had appeared in the New York Messenger and been copied all through the country a bit of free-verse doggerel in which , to Myron 's fury , a wandering motorist made complaint against the hotel world : Landlords ! They advertise a roomandabath for a dollarnhalfOn great big bellowing billboards all over the landscape ButWhen you get there they say thatJust toNIGHT ( The hotel being almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks .

And all the hotel chow tastes all alike , Clam chowder tastes like beef , and beef like pie , The while the pie tastes  --  if you will excuse  --  It tastes  --  it tastes like H-E-Double L.p279And then next morning : The elevator runner says " I hopeYou slept well , " and the bellboys , with their hands Outstretched in loving greeting , say " We hope , Each miserable urchin of us hopes , You slept like billy-oh . " The beaming clerk , he hopes you slept ; he hopes , " You have enjoyed your stay with us , old top , " The while he murders slumber with the bill , The monstrous inconceivably big bill . Hotels ! Henceforward I shall sleep in ditches soft , In barns , in owl nests , or in piggies ' pens , Dine on the dew and sup the evening star , Anything to avoid these blank hotels ! When he had recovered from what he conceived to be justified fury , Myron composed his first and last poem . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next five years it was reprinted in seventeen hotel journals from New York to Cape Town : Guests ! As a hotel keeper I like guests pretty wellI 've got to . I like them the way a prize fighter likes getting socked in the jawHe gets paid for it.  |p28o  Guests ! They steal the towels , the ashtrays , the blankets , the electric light bulbs , the small rugs , the stationery , the pens , the pin cushions , the tableware , the Hotel Red Book . They never leave their keys , and rarely send them back . They tell the hotel dick the girl is their cousin . They want you to cash big checks without identification , ANDThey say they 'll never come back if you do n't . Thank the Lord for that , anyway ! Guests ! They burn cigarette holes in the bedspread , the carpets , the chair arms . They leave the water , the costly hot water , running in the bowlFor hours . They sit on edges of beds and ruin the mattresses . They cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean mud off their shoes . They use same to wipe off mascara when they are females of the species . Guests ! The timid ones are scared of fire , burglars , earthquakes . The gally ones try to borrow the manager 's Tuxedo for banquets .

Maybe so . And maybe the guest was rude first . Guests ! They want strawberries out of season ( And free , on the club breakfast ) butThey sniff at strawberries in season , Great , big , beautiful strawberries in season , and then They want , They whine that they " just ca n't understand why they ca n't get " Imported Norwegian herrings And Mount Hybla honey And plovers ' eggsAnd squab on toastAnd allOn the eighty-cent club breakfast .

" Well , maybe some of the lines are n't quite smooth . My first poem . Maybe Ora would n't think it was equal to Longfellow or Ezra Pound or any of those old , classic bards . But the ideas are perfectly fine , " said Myron.  |p283To  EFFIE MAY , after a life of dusting and bed-making , with sodas at the drugstore and dances at Firemen 's Wigwam as her maddest dissipations , their suite at the Westward was Paradise . For himself Myron would have preferred to keep his suite as it was , with gray walls , few pictures , sparse furnitureof waxed oak , and plenty of space ; but he knew that Effie was all for brightness , and from Bermuda he had written to Luciano Mora asking him to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first saw it , after blushing prettily at the manly greetings of Elphinstone , Mora , and Carlos Jaynes , down in the lobby , squealed , " Oh , it 's just too simply adorably ducky ! " Myron beamed  --  and groaned . Luciano had jammed into bedroom and sitting room , each twenty by twenty , nearly all the unnecessaryfurnishings they could hold . There were small applewood tables , large mahogany tables , and nests of Chinese Chippendale tables . There were side lights in imitation of candles , and floor lamps of writhing gilded iron . There were a couch , and a chaise longue piled with saffron cushions of leather , pink-and-gold cushions of satin , tan cushions of broadcloth embroidered with emeraldblossoms , and a long , skinny , floppy , milk-faced , degenerate Columbine doll , which Effie May picked up with a scream of delight , and which Myron hated on sight . There were gray-and-blue lithographs of Paris , chromos of cats that were up to no good , and very funny and rather dirty French caricatures of cocottes and chalets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a small piano , which she touched affectionately , proving that music was not one of her sounder accomplishments , and there were even books  --  Myron 's books , consisting of a set of Dickens , two novels by Rex Beach and one by Conan Doyle , and sixty-seven volumes dealing with hotel-keeping and accounting . And the bathroom was in glossy black tiles , with lavendertub and bowl , and two dozen assorted towels . " My , they must expect us to get dirty ! " giggled Effie May . " But , oh , Myron , it 's all just too won'erful for words ! " After rising at seven , in Black Thread , and preparing breakfast before she could sit down to it , in a room that still reeked of last night 's creamed chipped beef , Effie May stretched her paws like an Angora at being able to have breakfast brought to her bedroom  --  and such a variety : a choice of three kinds of melons and thirteen kinds of cereal and four kinds of fish ( fish for breakfast ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and English strawberry jam in " ducky " little pots , and shirred eggs with little sausages , and kidneys with mushrooms ! " I 'm so excited ,  |p285Myron  , but I 'm such a pig ! I want to order everything ! I 'll get fat as butter ! You better watch me ! " " I will , old lady ! Trust me ! Watching is my specialty . Kiss me ! " She loved the importance of having the floor waiter  --  not a hired girl , but a real man waiter , and in a dress suit at nine-thirty in the morning !  --  bring in a table all for herself , and humbly murmur , " Madame is served . " She loved the silver , the amethyst-colored water glass , the coffee in a thermos jug , the English muffins tucked under a clean napkin , and the single rose in a slim vase . She loved loafing for an hour and nibbling and gravely daubing herself with jam like a baby , while Myron was already downstairs at work . She could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or massage , at any time Her Ladyship chose , in her room or down in the " beautician 's , " and the attendants were delighted to chatter about hotel feuds and scandal with the wife of the probable future president of the company . Effie May was indeed an Angora ; she loved strong , soft fingers at the roots of her electric hair , upon her flushed cheeks , across the nerves of her shoulders . The chambermaids were equally obsequious . They crooned , " Oh , no , ma'am , no hurry at all ! " when she had kept them out of the suite till eleven . She was delighted with the luxury of fresh bed linen daily , and she suspected now that , though the Lambkin household had regarded itself as Puritanically neat , she had never learned anything about dusting and sweeping . . . . To have them brush beneath the bed and the couch , and every day  --  that , she bubbled to herself , was " class . " And the whole housekeep/ing department was complaisant about carrying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded rooms of the Lambkin house she had longed for broad ribbons and laces and velvet . She rejoiced in having as much of them now as she wanted . To the welter on the chaise longue she added fluffy sofa pillows of apricot silk trimmed with lace ; she put flounces on the apparently unflounceable maple twin beds ; and the telephone in each of the rooms she hid under a doll with wide skirts of gold lace and tiny glass jewels , which caused Myron to curse wildly , though secretly , every time he had to telephone . She hung photographs , of her father quail-hunting , of Julia in tulle , of Herbert undergoing the mystic process of being turned from flesh into a Master of Arts , and of the whole family on the ancestral lawn in 1902 , a brown and faded print with Effie May herself a chunk of a child in a short , hiked-up skirt , a sailor hat , and a simper . Myron never complained about her bills . She believed him to be a rich man and wondered  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all his wealth , he went on working so anxiously . There was so excitingly much to do , at first ; rituals of the toilet , new to her who , for all the stuffy dignity of the Lambkin residence and the stores of cosmetics in her father 's handsome establishment , had known nothing beyond a quick bath in a tin-lined tub , and hasty rubbing with a skinny towel . Now she reveled in a long , languid soaking in warm water scented each day with a new kind of bath salts , in fringed towels vast as a sheet , in eau de Cologne and powder and lipstick , in nail cream and orange stick , and the gentle hands of a maid to do her hair  --  shep287who all her life had done it herself , or been subjected to the jerky impatience of Julia 's harsh fingers . She bought " lotions " with French names , and was surprised to discoverfrom a saleswoman , after she had been using them as toilet waters , that they were intended for the hair . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub on and rub off , and creams which were to be rubbed in and to stay in . She even tried having purpleand-greeneyelids , but at this Myron protested . So much to do ! After toilet and breakfast , and rearrangingthe flowers and cushions , and deciding whether the sandalwood cigarette box or the Chinese enamel box would look better on the teakwood stool , there was alwayswindow-shopping , with surprises unheard-of in Black Thread : English shooting sticks which turned into oneleggedstools , aquamarine necklaces , Parisian hats , cutglassdishes for hors d'oeuvres , onyx-topped evening sticks , Benedictine in unnatural-looking squat bottles , silver evening slippers . She had engagements at the dressmaker 's , at the shoemaker 's , and in between there were always these won'erful motion pictures , which had not yet reached Black Thread . When she saw Queen Elizabeth , with Sarah Bernhardt , and Zukor 's imperial settings , Effie May gasped with ecstasy over her brilliant new life . If there was nothing else , she could always stretch herself on the chaise longue , looking down at her new slippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her small feet , rejoicing at being secure from Julia 's demands from the kitchen , and slowly , luxuriously gulping down candy  --  real dollar-a-pound store candy ! Back home , they had had homemade fudge , or thirty-cent candy from the drugstore , the best their father sold . Dollar-a-pound candy , in gold and scarlet boxes with silver ribbons , was somethinga beau brought you in awe from Bridgeport , once in a year . Here , in the Westward , she could have all she wanted , and she wanted a good deal , so that she began to worry about becoming too plump , as she nibbled sweets , cakes , fruit preserved in syrup , all afternoon long . Myron was always attentive  --  at first . However busy , he telephoned up to her every hour ; he sent flowers daily ; he took her to lunch and dinner either in the brocadepaneledGeorgian Room of the Westward , or in outside restaurants , where she was gratified to have headwaiters bow and croak , " Good-evening , Mr. Weagle  --  goodevening , ma am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to see a lot of shows . We both of us need to broaden our minds , and lead a more you-might-say social life , " said Myron . The social life consisted largely of Luciano Mora , Alec Monlux , and Ora ; and to Effie May that seemed a very fine social life indeed , after the Lambkin parlor and Herbertwhining about the school board and Julia quarreling with Willis . It was both mind-broadening and lovely fun to listen to Myron and Alec and Luciano discussing ColonialReproductions and the presidential chances of GovernorWoodrow Wilson and the objections to the gear drive in mechanical potato peelers , while beautifully they drank whisky not straight but with soda water out of little bottles ! Then Luciano returned to Naples , to manage one of his father 's smaller hotels , and Myron and Effie missed him ,  |p289daily  . Without his laughter , their cocktail hours seemed a little dull . Myron was ever busier and , however fond when he did telephone , less likely to telephone at all . Suddenly , when neither Genuine Lotus Bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoise-shell mirrors in shop windows , nor rustling through the box for chocolates with nigger-toe centers , was so novel , Effie May discovered that she had nothing to do , and that she was bored . It had never occurred to Myron or to Effie that in a hotel suite , without even dish-wiping or feeding the chickens , and with no particular longing to study Imagism or Assyriology or the History of Endocrinology , she would not have enough to do . Being bored , she began to feel neglected  --  as she probably was , though the driven Myron could not think what to do about it . She felt the more neglected when Ora helpfully told her that she was . She took up French classeF , dancing classes , daily exercise at a gymnasium where ex-pugilists anxiously tempered the labor to the fat lambs , and she had dress fittings till Myron did begin to be alarmed about the bills . But she discovered in herself no talent for any of these arts save dressing . The jolly Effie May of Black Thread , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart now , in tweed suits and Paris models , and just when she was falling into real discontent and whimpering at Myron that she could not endure the emptiness of her days , she met Mrs. Bertha Spinney . Mrs. Spinney had red hair and alimony ; she devoted half her life to preserving these treasures , and the rest to elderly young bachelors with exploratory fingers and imported Chartreuse . She was forty-five in the afternoon sunlight , twenty-five in the dark , her cheeks were powdered as with cake flour , she laughed frequently , she told very good stories , and she clanked with heavy oxidized silver chains . Her suite was just down the hall from the Weagles ' , and Effie May had met her often in the elevator . She apparentlyknew all about Effie , and one day introduced herself and invited Effie in for a cocktail . Immediately they were chums . Myron did not like Bertha Spinney . The blind , doting , efficient , kindly Myron had never considered that , in all of New York , Effie had no woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and Alec and perhaps Ora . Effie May was happily occupied now . With Bertha Spinneyshe went window-shopping , and it was far more interesting , with Bertha to explain about diamonds that were blue and sapphires that were white , and how " Couronned ' Amour " perfume , in a small black bottle shaped like a fig , cost ten dollars because it was so enticing that men were maddened by it . Effie secretly longed for a bottle , and saved up the ten dollars for it , but whenever she went back to the shop and looked into the window , she shamefacedly did not quite dare to go in and ask for it . With Bertha she went to lunch , went to matinees , drove in the Park , ferreted out " little dressmakers who make you real Paris models for just nothing , my dear ! " and , at last , went to cocktail parties . The era of penthouses and multiple cocktails and public kissing and universally saying " Hello , darling , " of gigolos posing as bond salesmen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prohibition and the Great Peace had not yet come , but the Men About Town in 1911 did not do so badly on single cocktails . If they did not call the girls by their first names or manhandle them quite so quickly , when they got to it they meant it , and Effie May found herself the habituee of masculine flats that were floors of large old houses near Washington Square or Gramercy Park ; found herself  --  giggling  --  the adored friend , suddenly , of a dozen Wall Street men , or at least a-block-from-Wall-Street men , and occasionally even of genuine imported noblemen who , after five o'clock , when they had removed their alpaca office coats , became great gentlemen , yet so simple of heart that they were willing to go to tea with any lovely Norse goddess , providedshe paid the bill . Effie May discovered that she was charged and tingling with sex . She trembled , and felt as though fireworks had gone off inside her , when one of those public conveniences , the bachelors about town , stropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did respect Myron enough to remain what is technically known as a " good woman , " but she scampered back to him with such panting desire that he was overwhelmed with her ardor , her hot hands , her uncreased ivory skin , and while he seemed most strait-jacketed with filing cards and kitchen reports , he was most longing for her . Probably he was too rigid of spirit ever to have aroused her vastly by himself ; probably he owed a good deal to Bertha Spinney and the electrifying minor nobilities , but he never appreciated them . Effie met a whole society of detached women dwelling in hotels , idle women , mostly living on alimony and displayingenergy only when they dragged their former husbandsinto court . Many of them talked incessantly about their devoted care to their children , whom they got rid of by sending them away to school in winter and to camps in summer . Many of them were handsome , many of them were supporting lovers on the alimony from their curiously unwilling ex-husbands , and most of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a dozen blocks , there were hundreds of these leeches , and Effie May was inducted into their splendidly blood-gorged society by Bertha Spinney . One Mrs. Koreball , officially known as No. 772 , The Westward , gave a " party " for Effie May . Effie May found it charming . Mrs. Koreball , Effie perceived , was so sweet ! Such a little lady , with black hair so sleek and shiny , exactly parted in the middle , and with demure lips and the small chin of a child , but such gay and knowing eyes ! Her suite was ever so much bigger than Effie 's , and had the most won'erful real genuine Spanish antiques : a great , big , thick oak table  --  a refectory table , it was called  --  with the oldest wooden chairs , hundreds of years old , from a Spanish monastery ! And on the walls Mrs. Koreball did n't have ordinarypictures , but so different  --  images of the saints , very antique , and what she said were copes , all deep red with gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a candlestick of gilded oak with a candle four feet tall ! Mrs. Koreball did not serve cocktails , but a simply won'erful punch made , she said , of champagne and brandyp295them ; he recited , with ample illustration , " This little pig went to market . " It certainly was not Black Thread , but Effie May liked it , while assuring herself that she did n't . His wiry little hands were strong , and he knew how to do such unusual and interesting things with fingers . She meant to refuse his luncheon invitation , but he had n't yet given her a chance , and just when she was thinking out a good formula for it , he leaped up , dashed at the punch bowl , and brought back an enormous glass  --  her third . She sipped it slowly , determining with each sip to stop sipping , and she felt odd and very happy , and presently she seemed to be arguingabout going to Ye Bunche of Grapes , but a little uncertainas to just which side of the argument she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing by the couch , looking down at them , enormously tall and , though his lips smiled , terrifyingly stern about the eyes . Myron had never been in Mrs. Koreball 's apartment , but he knew the lady and disliked her with simple fervor . She was a neat little trick , with baby lips and chin , and with the more decorative hotel clerks she was plushgenteeland syrup-sweet . But she was always sending chambermaids out weeping , and bellboys out cursing . Every month she made the deuce of a row with the cashier about her bill ; she always insisted that the waiters were thieves and that she simply could n't have had that much mineral water . When they begged her to add up her own initialed checks , she said they were insulting , and stamped her dainty little foot , and her girlish eyes showed an active desire to boil the cashier in oil . She was one of the few guests who had furnished their own suites , and over that , too , there had been a gorgeous row . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to half the rent , though it meant only that they would have to store the furniture already installed . He devoutly did not wish to attend the punch-bowl party , but when she insisted that it was in Effie May 's honor , he had to go  --  merely cynically wondering in how many other people 's " honor " it might be also . As he came in , he looked sharply at the gang ; just the sort of well-pressed , well-spoken bill dodgers who were a hotel 's worst pest . The room decorations , he saw , were atrocious : a big slab of a table , dining chairs with backs that were too straight and provided with knobs for the gouging of your shoulder blades , and priestly vestments desecrated by being hung as wall ornaments . Spanish , eh ? Antique , eh ? Oh , yes . Well , he knew the venerable Iberian Handler from whom they came  --  none other than Senor Don Milton Pincus of the Bronx . Mrs. Koreball was buzzing , " So sweet of you to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you Myron , ' like your girl friend ! She 's the loveliest thing I ever saw ! Now you two have found your way , you must drop in for a drink often  --  the latchstring is always out . " ( " Gawd , it 's certainly fine for Effie to get away from Black Thread hicks like Mrs. Ted Dingle , and meet cul. tivated women of the world like this female ! " ) " But it always seems so hard to get hold of busy executiveslike you , Myron , and I suppose you handsome men are just chased to death by silly women like me ! Well , of course , ever since my Ex put me in my place and let me seep297what a mean , difficult wench I am , I 've learned to sit and fold my hands and just wait to be noticed . Now you come and have some punch . It 's quite good , even if I did make it  --  it 's nice orange juice , with maybe a tiny touch of dynamite and just a trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it 's shocking to talk business in society , but you 're so hard to get hold of , and do you suppose you could persuade that dumb beast of a housekeeper to give me just a few towels , now and then ? Wo n't you speak to her ? But now come and have a nice glass of punch . " ( He did speak to the housekeeper , to have the pleasure of justified wrath , and he discovered , as he had guessed , that Mrs. Koreball never used the biggest hand towel more than once , and that she was , on her best days , able to get through sixteen of them . ) Even before he had noticed the Bronx-Spanish furniture , he had spied and waved to Effie May , sitting over on a couch with a fellow named Harry Burphy , whom Myron knew as a clever , competent , sometimes amusing importer , whose only fault was overconscientiousness : he would never be content until he had seduced all the wives of all his friends . He watched them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disturbed . Effie May was giggling helplessly , as though she were a little tipsy , and letting Burphy rub her hand against his lips .... Myron had never thought so much of the New York husbands who made the glad cause of Freedom synonymous with Gin , and who let their wives crawl around the laps of other men . He stalked over , only the more annoyed at the innocent-eyed haste with which Burphy dropped her hand . " Hello , Burphy . Effie ! I 'm afraid it 's about time we were beating it . You know we 're going out to dinner . " " Oh  --  ur  --  we ? " she said . They were n't . She was certainly not drunk , but she was voluble almost to hysteria . When they were back in their own suite , he coaxed her to lie down for a nap . " Oh , I could n't sleep ! I feel like going somewhere and dancing ! Oh , I feel won'erful ! " she cried . But she passed out as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour on hour , moaning a little . He sat rigid in a straight chair by her bed , staring at her miserably . She was so desirable and young ! It was vileness for her to be touched by slimy people like Burphy and the Koreball , and , he decided , it was his fault , not hers . What could she know of hotel life and hotel loafers ? And he had planned nothing for her , he snarled at himself , except the beatitude of being with him when he had the time ! He longed to touch her cheek with a cautious finger ; there would be delight in just that frail contact . No , she must sleep . And afterwards there would be no more Burphys ! So he very sensibly went in and shaved . When she awoke , toward eleven , he had hot coffee and cold clam juice waiting for her , and he droned , quite placidly : " Effie , I 've just been thinking that " Oh , did I get cockeyed at Mrs. Koreball 's party ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I guess that punch had more kick than I realized . " " She 's a great sweetie , is n't she ?  --  so pretty and such fun ! "  | " Yes , yes , a fine woman . Look , Effie , I was just thinking : I guess you 've enjoyed living in a hotel  --  I certainly hope so , anyway . But I wonder if there 's quite enough for you to do , to keep you busy . How would it be if we took a flat , or maybe a house in the suburbs ? " " Oh , I " Of course we 'd have a first-rate maid to do all the dirty work , but still , what with ordering and maybe making up our room and visiting with the neighbors and so on , you 'd have something to keep you busy . " " Oh , but I 've had so much of housework , all my life ! Even times when Dad could afford a hired girl , I had to help with the dishes and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are n't going to send poor lil Effums back to the kitchen , are you ? She just loves to go to theaters and dances and restaurants and parties and all ! " " Oh , no , no , certainly not ! Go to ' em just as much  --  evenings , the second I can get away from my office . But I mean --  Daytimes . " " Oh , I know , but let 's wait awhile yet . It 's sort of fun here . But listen , honest , I did n't fall for that lil chimpanzee  --  Murphy or Burphy or Brophy or whatever his name was  --  Mrs. Koreball called him Harry  --  but I mean : I thought he was just silly ! " He awoke at dawn , thinking coldly : " No . She 's good and honest and kind . She has a real happy nature . But she has nothing in herself , in her mind , to keep her occupied . And she could never , possibly , hold down a job , the way Miss Absolom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's darn curious , that thep300three women that have impressed me should have been a Jewish school teacher , prob'ly from one of these internationalJewish families that are interested in music and painting the way I am in stew pans , and a grocery demonstratorold enough to be my aunt , and a quadroon chambermaid ! Oh , and then Effie for the fourth  --  four in all , of course , not three . " And it was my fault . Effie never for a second pretended to be anything she was n't . And I am crazy about her ! Apparentlyjust wanting to kiss a woman is a bigger bond in marriage than brains or virtue or beauty or any other darn thing ! And she is so kind and good . I 've got to coax her into a real home , away from these alimony leeches . I wonder if it will keep me from making my resort inn ? Well , if it does The candy and cakes and fruit in syrup , the chocolate with whipped cream and coffee with four lumps of sugar , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown potatoes , which the healthy Black Thread appetite of Effie relished and for which idleness gave her time , were all in competition with massage , with massage a bad second . Daily Effie May weighed herself in the bathroom and wailed , " Oh , I 'm getting terribly plump ! I must diet ! " And did n't . She still saw enough of Bertha Spinney and of Mrs. Koreball , though she was less naive and more suspicious about the innumerable Harry Burphys . And if she was still bored , now and then , she was rewarded for having to be that popular martyr of the era , a Bird in a Gilded Cage ,  |p301by  the admiration of her family when they descended from Black Thread . Julia , with Willis and young , came , not very much in. vited , to spend a fortnight with her before Christmas , and Julia , an authority , said that the Weagle suite was " simply elegant  --  so much taste . " She treated Effie May almost with respect . Herbert , with wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following Easter vacation . Herbert insisted that Myron stop shilly-shallying now and produce that large and well-paid hotel job right away , as he had promised . ( Myron did not remember promising it . ) He let it be known that he had been ever so generous ; he had given Myron his own sister , he had forgiven Myron for not being a Yale Man , and he had made a point of cutting out every reference to hotel affairs in the newspapers and mailing them to Myron . Myron reflected that there are so many people in the world who are eager to do for you things that you do not wish done , provided only that you will do for them things you do n't wish to do . He made a plot with the not-toowillingAlec Monlux , now manager of a large residential hotel in Yonkers . Alec came calling , affected to be awed by Herbert 's training and vocabulary , and offered him the position of assistant manager of the hotel . It was , he said unenthusiastically , a hard job . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for that reason they needed a man with Ierbert 's powers of philosophy . Herbert looked anxious but flattered until , after several acts of comedy , Alec led up to the climax , which was that Herbert 's salary would be thirty dollars a week.  | Herbert did not come to New York again for a year , and when Effie " ran up " to Black Thread next summer , Myron went with her for only forty-eight hours , of which he spent thirty-two with his mother . Most of that summer , a year after their marriage , Effie May loafed through at Frigate Haven Manor , a vast wooden pile of a hotel on the South Shore of Long Island . Myron came out only for week-ends , but Bertha Spinney had joined her , and all summer they munched candy , napped on the beach , yawned on the porch , giggled at flattery , and read novels about sheiks and civil engineers . All through one week , a man of whom she later remembered only that his white flannels were beautiful made whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep on his shoulder one evening , but after that she was snappish . But when Myron came out on Saturday , she was waiting for him so impatiently that he was gratified and rather bewildered ; she was at the station when he came in , and when he chuckled , " What do you say to a little tennis before dinner ? " she panted , " Oh , no , I want to kiss you , first ! " and , her hand in his , she dragged him to their room and seized him with so desperate a clutch that his whole being rose to delight in her . He had intended to spend most of that week-end in making plans for interesting 1VIark Elphinstone in the PerfectInn . But he swam with her , he loafed close beside her in hot little pine woods , and about building the Inn he never thought . Eying the men who were moved by Effie May 's pink and gold and by her ardent dancing , and who said thatp305When she returned to the Westward , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from sloth . ( " Another of my darn plans ! Oh , Lord , I do hope this one is intelli-gent ! " ) Many wives of hotelmen took part in running the shop , and seemed to enjoy it . Myron had had an uncomfortable feeling that he must save Effie from such toil , but ponderingthrough lonely evenings all this summer  --  sitting on hot nights in a large chair by a window that looked up hectic Broadway , stripped to his undershirt , a cold drink in his tired hand  --  he had convinced himself that this was a prejudicespringing from the memory of his overworked mother in a hotel kitchen . Effie May might become a great executive of the Back of the House , and have activity , triumphs , an income of her own . Was n't she a trained cook , housekeeper , buyer  --  for you could n't tell him that it had been the horse-faced Julia , and not his shining Effie May , who had controlled the Lambkin mansion ! Effie May was scarcely back from Frigate Haven when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , said Effie . Why did n't she look over the Westward kitchens and see if she could think of any useful changes ? Here was her commission to do so , signed by Elphinstone and Carlos Jaynes , and they had promised that if she had any valuablenotions , they would pay her . She was delighted , and next morning , early  --  for her  --  she was exploring the kitchens , alone . Myron would not go with her . No , he would only be in the way . She had had a tour of them a year ago , but she had no- ticed little beyond the obsequiousness ( or so she had consideredit ) of everyone to her big , handsome , clever Myron . Now , venturing through a swinging door into the vast main kitchen , she was bewildered and intimidated . The second cook waddled up with , " Good-morning , Mrs. Weagle . Anything I can do for you ? " " No  --  no  --  I just thought I 'd like to look around . " She dared not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , and at every step was more confused by the complex of coal ranges , charcoal broilers , steam tables , steam bake-ovens , soup boilers large as three washtubs , electric ice-cream freezers , electric egg boilers , machines for grinding bread crumbs and peeling vegetablesand polishing silver , the butcher shop , refrigerator rooms with various temperatures for fish , game , joints , and milk , storerooms like whole groceries , and skillfully operating all these mysteries , a hundred brisk men and girls . Their uniforms were so neat , their hands moved so surely . They looked at her as an outsider . She fled . When Myron came up to the suite for lunch , expectant , Effie May howled : " I went down and looked at the kitchen , and I was absolutely scared ! I got all confused ! I do n't know a thing ! I just know about frying chicken and scrambling eggs and like that , and sitting down and peeling potatoes with a little knife and not with a great , big , huge machine ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no , no , no ! I 'm too stupid ! And the noise scared me  --  it was so noisy , and the cooks  --  oh , they were nice asp307pie , but they were all laughing up their sleeve at me , they were , and I was scared ! " To comfort her , he took her shopping . He had always worried because he had never felt able to buy jewelry for her . He had heard that pretty women have a strange liking for jewelry . That was not very comprehensibleto him . He had always disliked diamond cufflinksand pearl stickpins on desk clerks . Why did n't they buy New York Central stock , or real estate equity , or something solid , whose value could n't ever decrease ? But still , authorities like Luciano Mora , who understood women , assured him that they really did care for these shiny stones , and he bravely led Effie May to one of the gaudiest shops on Fifth Avenue . There he was appalled to find that what he believed to be such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay three or four hundred dollars , was an alexandrite , priced at five thousand . He was glad to be allowed to sneak off with a hundreddollaropal . Effie May said she liked opals better than anything ; there was so much fire in them . Just like they were alive ! True , Mrs. Koreball convinced her , next day , that opals were unlucky , so she never wore the ring again . Every day Myron wished that they had a baby . They both asserted that they wanted one , Effie May most fervently , but the gods in charge of that department , so gratifyingly prompt with couples who did not want more children and could not afford them , had not seen fit to be generous to the Weagles . And , he fretted , a baby would save Effie May from slipping down into fat uselessness . After three years of marriage , and four , and five , Effiep308May accepted him as a necessary part of her good-natured , candy-nibbling existence , except that now and then she tried to be witty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Now and then , in cafe confidences , Myron and Ora Weagle had given to their friends curiously similar opinionsabout the effect of childhood environment upon their characters . " My father , " said Ora , " was a sloppy , lazy , boozehoistingold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was too busy to give me much attention , and the kids I knew were a bunch of foul-mouthed loafers that used to hang around the hoboes up near the water tank , and I never had a chance to get any formal schooling , and I got thrown on my own as just a brat . So naturally I 've become a sort of vagabond that ca n't be bored by thinking about his debts ' to a lot of little shopkeepinglice , and I suppose I 'm inclined to be lazy , and not too scrupulous about the dames and the liquor . But my early rearing did have one swell result . Brought up so unconventionally , I 'll always be an Anti-Puritan . I 'll never deny the joys of the flesh and the sanctity of Beauty . "  |p311And  , " My father , " said Myron , " was pretty easygoingand always did like drinking and swopping stories with the Boys , and my mother was hard-driven taking care of us , and I heard a lot of filth from the hoboes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as a reaction I 've become almost too much of a crank about paying debts , and fussing over my work , and being scared of liquor and women . But my rearing did have one swell result . Just by way of contrast , it made me a good , sound , oldfashionedNew England Puritan . " In 1920 , when Myron was forty , and Ora thirty-eight , they had almost exchanged appearances , except that Myron was five inches the taller . He , who had been roundfacedand slow , was fine-drawn now , and nervously quick , and his stiffly rearing flaxen hair , as it grew thinner , had become more brown , and lain humbly down under decadesof severe brushing . The slim , Shelleyan Ora had grown fat . His face was an orb of complacency , about the dapper mustache of an English police sergeant , and sulky , thickening lips . He was , as ever , darker of tint than Myron , but not in every light evidently so , for after dinner his cheeks were likely to shine greasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you . Ora usually saw you but did not seem to look at you . Myron was incorrigibly and perpetually bewildered by Ora 's zigzag of fortune , and occasionally , for a year at a time , he could not make out at all what Ora was doing and why he should not be even more bankrupt than he was . After Black Slumber , between 1905 and 1920 Ora had five other books published : three novels , one very daring , dealing with a prostitute who was a good girl , one still more daring , dealing with a prostitute who actually was a bad girl , and one comic , with involuntary assistance from Mr. Dooley , Irvin Cobb , George Ade , and P. G. Wodehouse . Then there was his guide to Canada  --  favorablyreviewed by all newspapers not published in Canada  --  and The Scientific Meaning of Dreams : A Handbook That Shows You to Yourself , in which Dr. Freud had been an unconscious collaborator . Myron was proud at the appearance of each of these , and he earnestly tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was excited when he found a publishers ' publicity note to the effect that Ora Weagle ( " Marcel Lenoir " ) , author of Slippers , Be Still , reported as one of the twenty-seven best sellers in Augusta , Tallahassee , San Jose , and Mankatothis past month , was planning a trip around the world on a whaling vessel . Or had taken a cottage in sight of Bailey 's Beach for the summer . Or was learning to fly . He never ceased feeling a little puzzled and unhappy when he learned from Ora that he had no plans whatever for whaling , flying , or viewing Newport . What Ora did between novels , Myron could not comprehend , and though he admitted that he was not one who could ever understand the ardors and stress of creation , he did timidly wonder if five books in fifteen year , - was so very much . And the guide book and dream book such little thin books , just trickles of mint-flavored text around large raw hunks of illustration . Authors generally were inexplicable , felt Myron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traveling men , and pot washers , but it did not occur to him that authors were ever anything save authors . All his life he was to picture Bernard Shaw as Ora Weagle with a beard , and Thoreau as an Ora who drank his whisky and sang " Frankie and Johnnie " in a log cabin instead of in a Fiftieth Street speakeasy . Whether or no his ponderous and hypocritical brother understood him , Ora was always busy . A fellow had to be , to make a living in a world that rewarded such muttonheadsas hotel keepers and stockbrokers , but too much feared the mad power of Beauty to give decent support to its creative artists . It would n't even provide a tiny pension , so that he might be secure , with bare provision for his modest wants  --  a cot bed , a chair or two , a little porridge and lobster salad , a quite infrequent jaunt to Europe or China , a few cigarettes and bottles of whisky and champagne , some girls , a refreshing summer in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just enough of a wardrobe so that the Maestro would not be shamed in the presence of supercilious millionaires , a cocktail now and then , a flat no larger than might be necessary for the entertainment of the combined editors of America , a couple of Monets for inspiration , just a shelf or so of hand-tooled books , with a mere emergency stock of liqueur brandy , absinthe , Swedish punch , arrack , Burgundy , Chateau Yquem , and perhaps rum  --  and he was even willing to give up the rum . Yet no one , even among those who pretended to be patrons of genius , was willing to give him such an insignificant pension . And Ora knew . He knew ! For he had made it his business to ap- proach every foundation for the cultivation of the arts , every committee in charge of awarding prizes or fellowships , and every publisher rumored to have gone insane and to have given advances on unwritten books . Myron did not merely bore him but furiously irritated him by incessant , clumsy , pawing hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " Yet he had to see Myron often . He had to live ! And he really liked Myron 's new wife  --  a kid from their own home town , Effie May Lambkin . She was good fun , for she thought Ora was the wittiest man she had known , and worshiped him instead of trying to get cute , like so many of these women . She was always glad to order up a late supper for him or , when Myron got stuffy , to lend him enough to get through till Monday . Ora was proud of the fact that , though Effie May was a beauty , in a coarse , hoydenish sort of way , he was so loyal to the family that he had made practically no effort to seduce her . And then Myron thought he was a rounder ! Oh , yes , he was busier than his brother could possibly know , and he had to do everything by himself , without any help from a crew of clerks and stenographers such as Myron had , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real work at all . Say what they liked , Ora knew that he was systematic . He had compiled a list of fifty fellow American authors who were sufficiently well rewarded , i.e. , commercially , so that they were worth soliciting , and he spent days in composing a letter confiding to these colleagues his difficulties , which were , it appeared , as follows : he was engaged in the last fatiguing months of finishing a long novel , his wife was ill , his two children wereP315hungry and without enough clothing to go to school , his rent was unpaid , and unless the benefactor could send him three hundred dollars at once , the whole bunch of them would have to commit suicide . This form letter he changed only in the first paragraph , in which he mentioned several books by the author  --  which was easy , because they were all listed in Who 's Who  --  and the last , where , in the simple , grave-eyed manner of a genius willing to face starvation and bend his pride to begging , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the master 's books ( give titles ) he knew his kindness , justice , and astoundingknowledge of human nature . On the first letter , from fifty prospects he had sixteen answers , with seven refusals , and nine checks ranging from ten dollars to one hundred and fifty , in total , six hundred and five dollars . None of them sent the full three hundred , but they crawled with apology for not doing so , which was precisely his reason for having put it so high . On a second letter to the thirty-four hounds who had not answered , he collected eleven more replies , with anotherhundred and thirty dollars , netting seven hundred and thirty-five dollars for six days ' work  --  two days composingthe form and four in typing the letters , and if the swell-head Myron could ever do as well as that , Ora would just like to know ! Beaming upon his honestly and arduouslyearned pile , Ora went on a splendid drunk with Colonel Falkenstein , Wilson Ketch and , from time to time , various girls , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did , though . Sober again , and very sick , with only sixteen dollars left of the seven hundred and thirty-five , and three months '  | rent due for his attic , Ora devoted himself to the twentythreemegalomaniacs who even yet had not been courteous enough to answer . Regarding these snobs , he had an airy wine-born plan . He wrote them a third time , not tenderly but insultingly . They were , he eloquently put it , boors , ingrates , cowards , and reactionaries . While they were making fools of themselves by trying to ape the rich with their Palm Beach villas , Vermont stock farms , and royal suites on liners , he was forced to support himself by stokingfurnaces twelve hours a night , that he might devote himself to creating a Real American Art . This drew , from the twenty-three , twelve more blanks , three checks , and eight letters of furious reply . It was for the last that he had really been hoping . Here he had eight original and unpublished manuscripts , three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America ungrudgingly devoted themselves and their noblest blasphemy to making it clear that they regarded him as a liar , a crook , and a damned nuisance . He read them with shouts of happiness , and bustled out to sell them to an autograph dealer , at from three to sixty dollars apiece . He made second and third and fourth lists of fifty philanthropists each , extending his sales appeal from the innocent composers of books to newspaper editorial writers , colyumists , cartoonists , playwrights , and rich women reported as having attended public poetry readings , and he widened his selling area to take in Canada , Great Britain , Ireland , France , and Germany . Each three months he made a spirited campaign of high-pressure salesmanship , and cannily did not return to any list oftener than once a year . P317So on the whole the Ora who , with shy boyishness , with wistfully quivering thick lips , showed to Myron and Effie May the gin-scented attic in which he had to live had a slightly larger income than Myron 's , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gallantly continued with his books and infrequentmagazine fiction , and though his four lists demandedso much painful typing , Ora was most occupied by ghosting  --  the writing of books to be signed by other and more famous persons . He came to have rather a sound reputation for the work , and various publishers sent for him , though they disgusted him by sourly refusing to pay one penny till the work was done  --  the dirty money grubbers ! Thus , at various times , Ora was an ex-senator who had destroyed the Wall Street millionaires , another exsenatorwho had wiped out the Reds , a **31;2181;TOOLONG who had had three kings as lovers , a forger who had done twenty years in the pen , a chess champion , and a Hollywood dog . Ghosting paid better than the composition of begging letters , but he never gave them up , for no sacrifice was too great for his art . And it was as an artist , as a seer , that he was able , he crowed , to put it all over Myron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he would crucify a horrible parent named Tim Wiggins , who kept a foul restaurant and was beastly to his sensitive son , and possibly in connection with this enterprisehe had run up to Black Thread Center for a week . Returned , he charged in on Myron .   " Well , the great innkeeper and psychologist that can tell a crook before he 's signed the register , has certainly pulled one swell boner ! " said Ora , winking at Myron 's pretty typist . Myron hastily sent her out and stormed , " What the devil do you mean now ? " " I 've been up to the Center , and I saw Dad and Mom , and since you were so kind as to rescue them from working and give them a nice easy old age , in their lovely little bungalow among the roses  --  well , they 're simply going nuts with nothing to do , that 's all ! " " Nonsense ! " Myron went to Black Thread next day . His mother was sitting in a filthy kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , she sobbed , so got out of the habit of activity that now she could not stir at all , and old Tom , no longer needing to make an appearance as host , was drinking worse than ever . " I 've tried reading , and I 've tried church work , and I 've tried knitting and talking to the neighbors , but I guess folks like us , that have worked real hard all our lives , just do n't know how to loaf , " she said . " I 'm kind of scared , dear . I 've been noticing how many business folks seem to suddenly pop off and die when they retire and say they 're so glad they 're out of the harness and now they 're going to have a good time . " He was bewildered . He assured himself that he really had meant well . He told himself that he could not afford to buy off the present lessee of the American House , and that if he did , his parents would let it go dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he tried to consultP319them , but his mother only wept and looked forlorn . He might have rented a farm , except that at the Lambkins ' , when he hinted of his problem , Herbert blatted , " Now you 're married into Our Family , you ca n't go on being selfish and just thinking of yourself , the way you always have ! . . . That fellow Monlux , offering a man with my degrees fifteen hundred a year , and you never even called him down ! . . . And I want to tell you that I 'm not going to have my sister 's father-in-law running a miserable little tavern right here in our own town ! Why do n't you put ' em on a farm ? " That did it . Myron gave his father and mother a wild week in New York  --  Tom said that the Westward wasted a lot of good coin , dressing up the bellhops in fool monkey jackets , and as a seasoned executive he disapproved of such incompetence  --  and he settled them again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she toiled twelve hours a day , began again to whistle . And Ora commented on it all , " Just as I 've always told you , Myron , you lack the artist 's sense of people . You 're probably more generous than I am , in some ways , but I see inside people and let ' em alone . " The young woman whom Ora brought up to the suite to meet Effie May and Myron , late in the evening , was a very friendly young woman . Within ten minutes she was calling them " Teeny the Swede " and " Snookums , " and she was demanding , " Well , where 's the hooch ? What 's the idea of holding out on the girl friend like this ? " And after the whisky , a good deal of it , she offered to take off her clothes and do imitations of Isadora Duncan .   Myron saw that the perplexed Effie May was wondering whether she ought to take her brother-in-law 's lady friend as a model . He lured Ora to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chase her out of here . " " What the devil do you mean ? " " I do n't like her , though probably she 's merely silly . Out ! " " Then I 'll go , too ! And I 'll stay away ! " " All right . Sorry not to see you again , but this is my house " Oh , no , it is n't , darling ! It 's anybody 's house that 's got the money , no matter what a stinker he may be , and you 're just a hired man in it  --  you and your hick wife ! " Myron raised his fist , dropped it to his side , and muttered , " Get out . " He did not see Ora for a year after that . He felt guilty and considerably relieved . He pictured his poor little brother in that poor little attic of his , and doubtlesshe would have suffered if it had not been for the fact that , as Ora was unanimously agreed , he lacked imagination . P321IT WAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been married for five years , that Myron became prouder than ever he had been in his life , prouder and taller and more excited . Effie May announced that she was going to have a baby ! Healthy wench as she was , though too well fed , she had no unusual trial , and in the spring of 1917 they had an eight-pound son , very fine and exceptionally handsome  --  which meant that even in the first month he was recognizablyhuman . Now , along with every thought about his Perfect Inn , Myron gave another thought to the future when he would go hunting and fishing and traveling with His Son . He was named Luke , more or less after Luciano Mora . Before the baby 's birth , Myron did what he called " putting his foot down , " and insisted that they must have more of a home than a hotel suite . . . . How he reconciled it with his advertisements that " A Suite at the Luxurious WestwardHo ! Will Solve All Your Housekeeping ProblemsP322We 're Glad to Do Your Hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever tried to . Effie May said that she " was n't  --  quite  --  sure  --  it 's kind of convenient living in the city . " Myron was sure for her . " I 'm certainly not going to have our baby grow up one of these horrible , ringleted hotel children , yelling in the corridorsand bossing the servants and showing off to strangers , " he said , and was beautifully unconscious of any heresy to his faith as a sealed hotel keeper . They found and rented a seven-room house with a small garden in Mount Vernon , not too far from the station . Once it was veritably his , his own house , at least for a year , Myron found it magic with privacy . Its white wooden pillars and roofing of green imitation slates , its short sidewalkof particolored slabs of stone , its yellow brick fireplace , its piano and glassed-in unit bookcases and ashtray stands were different , obviously , from those of any other house in Westchester County , and possibly in America . The doubtful Effie , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matters of piety and bridge , found the place at least won'erful . " Why , now we got all the nice things in both New York and Black Thread ! " she would exclaim , with awe . " I can go in for the theater or to see Bertha , and still have a garden and quiet for Junior , and such dandy neighbors to run in on  --  high-class  --  lots of them have tea almost every afternoon , and they play real bridge , for money ! " Myron loved the peace of it  --  what time he had it . Often he could not get home till midnight ; often he had to be away by seven in the morning . But he rejoiced in seeing Effie May and Luke in the diminutive garden . He wasp323only a little angry , so used was he to this attitude , when certain of his neighbors hinted that as a hotelman he would be able to direct them to gay but economical ladies and to powerful but inexpensive booze . In the solitude of the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make plans in his latest notebook for the Perfect Inn . During the war , when he served in the Quartermaster'sCorps , he enjoyed that dangerous position , because he could be home every evening and all day Sunday . When the conflict was over , at least theoretically , he went back to his regular work as Mark Elphinstone 's first assistant and to his irregular hours at home with Effie and the miraculousLuke , who was no dullard as he himself had been but , at eighteen months , could say " Da ! " He was saving money constantly , investing it , after a good deal of inquiry , mostly in hotel shares . Its accumulationwas in his mind related with Effie , Luke , and the Perfect Inn . He never missed a train into the city , but he was never seen to hurry . . . . A tall man , inexpressive of face , a typicaldull captain of business , making little business notes in a little pocket book , in the smug smokiness of a commuters ' train that clattered through dun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ora still lay dreaming of damsels in Poictesme .

THROUGH all of 1918 , Mark Elphinstone was weakened by attacks of angina pectoris , and the instant he was out of the army , Myron became unofficial president of the Elphinstone chain . Now he first really knew Mark as a human being . For years Mark had lived in a large and very pseudobaronialapartment on the top floor of the Westward , with imitation beams , a heraldic fireplace , and a mute musicians ' gallery in the salon . Myron had rarely been in it , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was present through two of Mark 's dreadful attacks , P325brought on by anger , or by an effort to get up and dress . Then , in an agony that lasted a minute and seemed to last an hour , Mark felt as though he were dying , as though a great hand were squeezing his heart , while the pain cut a gash up to his neck and down his left arm . He panted , his eyes bulging with terror . Myron and the nurse stood by the bed , in the embarrassment of futility . The horror gone , he would try to laugh , and mutter , " Tell Carlos Jaynes to stop grabbing my heart  --  tell him to stop it  --  want it stopped right away . " He talked now , wanderingly , of his private life . He was a widower ; his one child , a daughter , was married to a lawyer of elegance , living in Brookline . Myron guessed , when he saw her , that she was gallantly trying to forgive her father for still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was very crisp and literate , and her father was humble and conciliatory in her presence . For hours , when she had gone , Mark boasted to Myron about his daughter 's music , her Italian , her friendship with bishops . The doctor warned Mark that he must " avoid all muscular excess and all emotion , " and Mark 's latest secretary , the clean , swift , amiable , rather dull young Mr. Clark Cleaver ( he was rumored to be a wizard at the parallel bars and flying rings in the Y.M.C.A. gymnasium ) kept stirring Mark into furious emotion by coaxing him to avoid all emotion . Myron had sense enough to let him rave and get it over . It was the Carlos Jaynes faction who brought on the catastrophe . Jaynes 's brother-in-law , large stockholder in the Elphin-P326stone Company , called on Mark . Myron was not present , but he learned from Clark Cleaver that the brother-in-law pussy-catted about , patted Mark 's hand , assured him that he would instantly be out and playing eighteen holes of golf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff brigand most detested , hinted that Mark ought to resign and make Jaynes his successor . The brother-in-law gone , Myron was sent for , and arrivedby Mark 's bed along with the hotel doctor . Mark was raving , " That damned Jaynes and his damned relatives ! I 'll fire him ! He 's fired right now ! Cleaver , you get on the phone and tell Jaynes he 's fired , right now . " Cleaver dared not move . " Get him , I tell you , get him , get him , get him on the phone , I tell you ! They think they 've got me down ! They think they can jam Jaynes down my throat ! I 'll show ' em ! I 'm not afraid of any man living . I 'm not afraid of anything ! " He choked . He clenched his fists in agony . His face was gray as March snow , and was greased over with cold sweat . " But I am afraid of death ! " he whimpered . His old kneaded face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped from it , and he muttered , " Afraid of death ! Myron ! Cleaver ! Stick by me ! Stay there . Do n't go away . I feel lonely . I 'm afraid ! " Veteran wisdom and courage came back into it , as the spasm lifted , and he snarled , " I wo n't let ' em make me afraid , with their damn sympathy ! Eighteen holes of golf ! There 's no man living can make me play golf ! My game is Men , and they ca n't beat me ! I 've licked ' em ! " And he gasped and died.  |p327The  directors of the Elphinstone Company met two hours after the funeral and learned that Mark Elphinstone'sdaughter , his sole heir , had contracted to sell all her holdings in the company to Carlos Jaynes and his brother-in-law . They elected Jaynes president of the company . An hour after that , Jaynes sent for Myron and merrily offered to him the assistant managership of the ElphinstoneAkron hotel . Carlos Jaynes was not vastly popular with his fellow hotelmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reputation of Myron to have been kicked out . After a week  --  though that week , with its agonizing enforced idleness , was long enough  --  he was offered the managership of a hotel in Wilmington , and took it , leaving Effie May and Luke in Mount Vernon . He left Wilmington for the not-too-important but instructivejob of chief assistant manager at the Hotel Crillonof New York , which had only five hundred rooms but was the newest and smartest hotel in the country , with a clientele altogether different from the run of amiable and prosperous social nobodies at the old Westward . The Crillon was patronized by ambassadors , princes , internationalcrooks , and Americans so wealthy that they could afford to live on Long Island and again be farmers like their grandparents . He learned not to blink at **25;2214;TOOLONG and small sleek dinners in private dining rooms at fifty dollars a plate ; he learned that one half , at least , of the excessively rich are as annoyed as one half , at least , of the excessively poor when they are insulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief problem was : Which pays better , ten dollars a day that you get or a hundred dollars a day that you do n't get ? He did not vastly care for the Crillon , its deftly obsequiousstaff , or its deftly supercilious guests . Not even yet was he fond of foot-kissing . For one summer he was manager of the Frigate Haven , with Effie and Luke near him in a hotel cottage ; for nearly a year and a half he was managing director of a large hotel in Philadelphia ; and by then , in 1922 , when he was fortytwoyears old , he had enough reputation and enough advantagefrom the hotel world 's continued enmity to Carlos Jaynes to be able to stop roving and settle down in a positionthat was by far the most important and best-paid he had yet held : general director of all the Pye-Charian hotels of New York , and managing director of their largest house , the Victor Hugo . The Pye-Charian Company consisted of four men : Richard Montgomery Pye , the president ; Adolph Charian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Colonel Ormond L. Westwind , the celebrated criminal lawyer , after-dinner speaker , and vestryman of St. Thomas 's ; and Nick Schirovsky , who called himself a manufacturer of mineral waters and whom Myron more than suspected of being a wholesale bootlegger . Myron himself and " Jimmy " Shanks , manager of one of the Pye hotels , also had each a few shares in the company . The holdings consisted of the Victor Hugo , a new elevenhundred-bedroom , each-with-bath , transient hotel onp329upper Broadway , and six residential hotels on the West Side of New York between Seventieth and One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street . The largest of the residential hotels was the Dickens , on Riverside Drive , managed by Shanks . Jimmy was big and jovial and grinning and practical-joking , with his crisp rolls of the blackest hair ; a shrewder and modernized version of J. Hector Warlock . He had played football for two years at the University of Kentucky and been expelled for inattention to his books and general hell-raising . An old friend of Myron , Clark Cleaver , Elphinstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief clerk of the Walter Scott Hotel . Of all these men it was Richard Montgomery Pye whom Myron saw most often . His job , as president , was to control the somewhat mysterious finances of the chain and to demand improvements which Myron had to carry out . Dick Pye was slender and suave as a greyhound on a silver chain . He was chief among the new sort of hotelmen , detested by Mark Elphinstone , who were as likely to arrangetheir affairs on the golf links , in country-club bars , or in fast motorcars as in offices or the kitchen . He was a smiling man , not very tall and not over forty ; he was apparentlyaccepted as one of their own by the most **34;2241;TOOLONG circles on Long Island , and he played polo with the second team of the Old Chapel Club . Pye 's origin was in dispute . One faction asserted that he was the son of a doubtful minor Tammany official and had begun his career by selling newspapers and continued it as bellboy in a scabby hotel in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what is known as a " fine old family . " Virginians said he came from a fine old family in Massachusetts , and Massachusettsans said he came from a fine old family in Virginia . Harvard men said he was a graduate of Yale , Yale men said he was a graduateof Princeton , and Princeton men were divided between Harvard , Yale , the University of Oklahoma , and Maine Agricultural College . And Dick Pye smiled and never explainedand played polo and arranged for mortgages and persuaded smart but liquorous young men to take costly suites at the Victor Hugo or the Dickens for the whole winter season , and seemed to know what Myron and Jimmy Shanks and Clark Cleaver were doing , every moment , and what unknown clerks , in second-rate houses a thousand miles away , could be trained to take their places . All very old and very rich women said that " Dicky " was the sweetest boy they had ever seen , and all professionalgamblers said that his poker was worthy of the most eminent practitioners . Myron liked Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then dreaded them as poisonous , after the honest piracy of Mark Elphinstone . His job was to control every department of the Victor Hugo , as resident manager , and to glance over the conduct of the six residential hotels . To these he was to give not so much time as experience and dependability . He looked into their kitchens or linen rooms or garbage trucks or the pile of chambermaids ' O.K. 's on made-up rooms , and some/times there was fatherly advice to department heads and sometimes there was quick guillotining . Most of his hours were devoted to the Victor Hugo . The changes in hotels , in New York , and in all America , between 1905 , when Myron had gone from Tippecanoe Lodge to the Westward , and the 1920 's , were illustrated by the differences between the Westward and the Victor Hugo . The Hugo was intended to appeal to the same sort of solid , upper-middle-class , prosperous patrons , and it was on the same Broadway , though twenty blocks farther north . But it was nearly twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty , and it had none of the spurious grandeur which had gladdened the guests of the Westward in 1905 ; none of the velvet or tortured ironworkor carved teak or copper minarets or bread-pudding marble . It had , indeed , the " good taste , " or what to the 1920 's and 1930 's seemed the good taste , of massive simplicity . The main entrance was a severe doorway of Indianalimestone , with no awning of glass and gilded iron ; the lobby , lined with uncarved cedar panels , was half the size of the Westward 's , and considerably less inviting to lobby loungers ; the elevators bore no sunbursts of brass , but they were thrice as swift and silent , and the elevator runners discoursed on the current weather only with clients who desired it . The Victor Hugo bedrooms were free of imitation-brocade and lace table covers , armchairs with frayed fringes , and ornamental brass beds which , even after many renovations , were still to be found in the Westward . There was less of tax-breeding space and fewer dust-collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radios in all rooms , central vacuum-cleaning plant , electric refrigeration , stainless metal alloys instead of damp and seamy surfaces throughout the kitchens . There was a " coffee shop , " approximately as large as that of the Grand Central and as busy . There were graduates of the Cornell and other hotel schools in every corner . But if the Victor Hugo was more expeditious and sophisticated and in better taste than the Westward , the trim bedrooms were far smaller , with less room for nervous patrons to poke about ; if the washed and filtered air was purer , there seemed to be less of it for placid breathing ; if the restaurants were better lighted , they were less leisurely ; if there were more tropical fruits , there was less generous cooking ; if the whole thing had become a better machine , it had become a less comfortable home . America and the hotel of 1905 were not far from the America and the inn of Martin Chuzzlewit ; America of the late 1920 'S had lost for all time that large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had driven from Saratoga Springs to Nice in a sixteen-cylinder car . It had gone from cotton stockings to silk ; from the small beer of Weber and Fields to the champagne in Of Thee I Sing ; and sometimesMyron was bewildered and a little uneasy . The guests of the Victor Hugo had familiar faces  --  more regularly shaved than at the Westward  --  yet their hearts seemed to Myron different , and he did not altogether like the change . He still had the old dependables : the up-state banker and his family who came to New York for a month , for shopping and the opera , the Detroit purchasing agent and the Phoenix department-store buyer and the branchp333manager from Spokane , all of them trained travelers who appreciated service . But among them , as was natural to a hotel which had Nick Schirovsky as one of its owners , had crept a new race of mild and solid-looking and well-behavedmen , quietly dressed and most generous with tips , whom he guessed to be gamblers , racketeers , sellers of dubious stock and real estate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ever so much quieter about sending for mineral water to accompany illicit whisky than were the innocent buyers , and they were less likely to sing " Mandy , Mandy , Sweet as the Sugar Cane " after it . Yet Myron hated them , and felt insecure when he observed their intimacy with the aristocratic Mr. Richard Montgomery Pye . He knew that the bellboys were procuring liquor for the guests , from the lofty superintendent of service , but he could do nothing about it . They were under license of Dick Pye , and they shared the profit with Pye , Charian , Schirovsky , and the pious Colonel Westwind . But they shared neither profits nor confidences with Myron . That was the one detail of the hotel management that he neglected . He had some comfort out of investing in Frigate Haven Manor , and a larger , more ambitious summer resort , Laurel Farms , and in improving his investments by giving advice as an expert . But after three and a quarter years as general director of the Pye-Charian hotels , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be a good innkeeper . He believed that he was . But just as he had never been particularly obsequious to the German barons and French vicomtes and Long Island squires at the Hotel Crillon , so he could make no especial effort to impress the slick friends of Nick Schirovskyas their natural provider and protector . He said so to Gritzmeier the chef , and was shocked into doing something about it , instead of merely sitting around and enjoying his noble discontent . Otto Gritzmeier was managing chef of the Hotel Victor Hugo , and for him Myron had more respect and liking than for any other officer in the Pye-Charian chain . He was a Swiss , trained in Lausanne , Biarritz , Hamburg , Milan , and Bournemouth . At fifty he had come to America as chef of the distinguished Restaurant Sylvere , but that shrine of gourmets had closed with Prohibition , and Gritzmeierhad reluctantly turned from Homard Saute a la Dumas to the Standard Cost per Ounce of Hamburg Steak . Myron was merely supposed to confer with him , several times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and special dinners and the equipment and personnel of the kitchen , but almost every day found Myron sitting at Gritzmeier 's desk , in his tiny glass-walled office in the good reek of the enormous kitchen , happily recovering from Schirovskyism . Just Gritzmeier 's appearance , the floury yet healthy cheeks , the gray hussar mustache and imperial , the tall cap and apron and overalls ( for Gritzmeierwas one of the few managing chefs who refused to dress in a lounge suit ) , was refreshing after the pinkcheeked , ebon-haired , glossily brown-suited guests in the more expensive suites of the Victor Hugo . He became almost as intimate with Gritzmeier as he once had beenp335with Luciano Mora  --  the cautious ultra-Yankee released by his admiration for an ultra-Continental . This day in September , 1925 , he growled to Gritzmeier , " We 've got to get together next week and plan the supperdancemenus for the season for the Laurentian Grill . Damn the grill ! I hate planning anything for a bunch of drugstore cowboys with pocket flasks  --  trying to compete with the speakeasies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country inn  --  good as any resort hotel in Europe . " " Then vy do n't you , Chief ? " " Well , it 's difficult getting started " T'ree years you 've been talking about your fine inn . Talking ! Vy do n't you do it ? " " Oh , I " You got some money saved , aind't you ? You can get the rest , cand't you ? Vy do n't you do something ? You aind't going to get a whole lot younger , Chief ! " " You 're right . I 'm forty-five and -- I 'll do it ! I guessI will ! " And , rather scared , he knew he would . It was easier to undertake the labor of financing and building his Perfect Inn than it was to loiter and face the cynical old eyes of Otto Gritzmeier . P336JUST do n't know where all my time goes to , " was Effie May 's favorite observation . She said it oftener , these days , than " won'erful . " They had a larger house in Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after school hours with Luke , a tall boy of eight , finding out what orders the maid had decided to receive and then giving them , playing RussianBank with Myron on evenings when he did not feel like reading , discussing garden seeds and the wearing qualityof boys ' trouserings with the neighbors , trimming the church with flowers and rather irregularly going to a woman 's musical and literary club , she lived the same busy and unplanned life that she would have lived in Black Thread , save that once a fortnight she went into the city for the theater or a placid , domestic afternoon in a speakeasywith Bertha Spinney . She was well content , and gnawed candy as delicately and as much as ever . She was extremely fat , and at thirtyfourlooked a cheerful forty , and now that she rarely heardp337Ora 's sneers , she regarded Myron as a sage and knew that he depended on her as on cool water . Myron had telephoned that he would be home at seven and Luke had been permitted to sit up for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement walk from street to house , occasionally falling off it into the bug-eaten rose bushes . The tall , nervous shape of his father swung around the street corner . " Hello , Dad-dy ! " " Hello ! " " Hel-LO ! " " Hello , son . " " Whaja bring me ? " " Not a thing ! " " Not anything ? " " Not one darn thing ! " " Not anything at all ? " " No , sir ! Expect me to bring you a present every night ? " " Sure-pop ! " " Who ever taught you to say that ? " " In school and then , of course , you always say it to Ma . " " Oh , Ido , eh ? " " Uh-huh , sure , every day ! " " Well , then , I guess I 'll have to see if anybody 's stuck any chocolate in my pocket . Though mind you , Luke , I disapprove of bribery as a means of enforcing discipline in large , efficient , modern institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's swell  --  peanut brittle ! "  | " Luke ! How would you like to live right out in the country , but near a lovely inn with grand food  --  fishing and swimming and meadows and hiking and squirrels and  --  oh , and flowers  --  you know , everything ! Real country ! How 'd you like that ? " " Punk . " " No , really ! Would n't you love the country ? " " Naw . I like it here . It 's all hicks in the country  --  like at Uncle Herbert 's . Let 's stay here . Or maybe move into New York . That would be dandy ! Then I could go to the movies twice a day ! " Myron meditated , " That helps ! I can see that everybody is going to approve enthusiastically of my going off to run a country inn . Splendid ! Oh , hell ! . . . But Luke will like it ! I 'll make the kind of place he 'll like ! " " I 've told you lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myron . " You know  --  my farm near the Center . Lake Nekobee . " " Yes , sure , steen thousand times , " said Effie . She yawned , then smiled in apology . " Well , at last , after chewing the rag about it so many years and being scared of undertaking it all the time , I 'm really going to do it ! " " Honestly ? " She was affectionate and entirely unimpressed . " Yes . I mean it . Now I want you to pay some attention , Effie . If I put this through , or rather , when I do , it will affect you . We 'll have to live there  --  I aim to have a place I can keep open all the year round  --  winter sports , too  --  and we 'll have to live there . "  | " Oh , but darling ! " She squeaked like a cornered mouse . " I ca n't leave the nice neighbors here , and Junior used to the school and all , and the Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be near the Family , I suppose , but to not ever be able to get to New York and see some shows Oh , Ido n't think that would be any fun at all ! " " We 'll try to get down to New York for a month every winter , or say late fall , between seasons , and not do a blessed thing then but raise cain and enjoy ourselves , and that 's something we 've never had time to do , never . " " Well --  " She looked about her well-loved sitting room , the huge cabinet phonograph , the automatic heat regulator , the silver cocktail shaker that would be taboo within reach of Brother Herbert . He knew that she was trying to nerve herself , and for her confused gallantry he loved her . " Well , if you think it 's best , Myron . " " Look ! I 'll build us a grand cottage near the Inn  --  lots more room for Luke to play than here , and I do n't know that the school in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids around New York are so frightfully fresh and knowing and impertinent . Sure-pop ' ! ! " " Well , I guess there 'd be some nice folks at the Inn , too . " He knew that she felt insecure . Ought n't he to give up this unnecessary plan and go on with Pye-Charian ? No ! Be valet to Nick Schirovsky and his friends or , at best , give his life to wholesale cafeteria-keeping ? There were peace and quiet skill in the tradition of every ancient Cat and Fiddle , or White Hart , or Old Bell , in which , immemorially , tired and drenched and hungry men had taken their ease . And he would make a greater masterpiece than any of them . " But I wish Effie could see it like that , " he pondered . He talked frankly about it to Ora , for Ora , he told himself , was the one person who would understand his doing something a little unconventional . A year after he had kicked Ora and his girl out of the Westward  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into each other on the street , sheepishly shaken hands , and gone to lunch . He had seen Ora occasionally ever since . Hugely approving , he discovered that Ora had an almost regular job writing two-reelers for the movies , and articles for the new magazines devoted to the movie world , and he said profoundly , " If he does get drunk pretty often , still there 's quite a few fellows with good minds that have that unfortunate habit ! " He outlined the Perfect Inn and his determination to leave Pye-Charian . He waited for the first approval since Otto Gritzmeier 's . " Huh ! " said Ora . " I think you 're a damn fool . Here you 've got a good chance to go ahead with these highclassbootleggers and be a member of the firm some day , and then you can transfer to some other big outfit that is n't crooked , or only just average crooked . And you want to chase off and start another fancy arty tearoom , the kind you made out of the American House ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originality for his long suit ought n't to strut around trying to show off his origi-nality ! "   " I 'll do it , just the same ! " growled Myron , and talked of baseball . Richard Montgomery Pye , giving audience in his office , which resembled a Louis XVI boudoir reproduced by a steel manufacturer , remarked formally , " I wo n't say that the firm , or at least Adolph Charian and I , might not come in on financing your inn . But I think the project is pretty small for a man of your executive ability . At best it would only pay a fair profit on a few hundred thousand . You see , I 'm laying my cards on the table , Weagle . We 're more than satisfied with you . I think sometimes you 're too cautious , and worry too much about penny-pinching , but then , we 're all four too much inclined to gamble , and you check us , and you have the patience to fuss with which firm will sell crackers at a sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't customarily steal the handles off the office safe . Why do n't you stick with us , and get in on the big money ? We might take you in as a partner in a few years , and make it easy for you to acquire a share , and I can see us swinging a hotel twice as big as this . " " And twice as noisy ! " Myron thought silently . " So give up this idea of yours for a year or so , anyway , and stick around . " " No , I 'm sorry , Pye , but I 'm all set on it . Will you talk to Charian , or shall I ? Or shall I arrange for the financing outside ? I figure I 'll need about two hundred thousand over and above what I have . Shall I see Charian ? " " No , I will . I 'll let you know . But I hope you 'll change your mind . "   Within two days Dick Pye informed him that Charian and he would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Schirovsky , out of it , since their fine talents were better suited to criminal law  --  to the breaking and the avoidance of the same  --  than to country innkeepingand the exploitation of daisies . Pye and Charian had a hundred and fifty thousand or so in hand ; the other fifty thousand could be provided on mortgage . " But we still think you 're foolish to start anything so half-faced as a little resort hotel like that , and we 're willing to invest in it only because we believe you 're competent and dependable . We still want you to think this whole business over again , " said Pye , unapprovingly . And almost as unapproving was Alex Monlux , who quivered , " If it should flop , you 'd be right out of things here ; hotel game moves so fast it changes overnight . And I 'd of thought you 'd had enough of associating with the goldenrod and gophers . I certainly did , in Iowa . I agree with what Effie May was arguing : New York is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rich , importantguys , and keep polished . " In fact no one approved , besides Gritzmeier and , unexpectedly , Jimmy Shanks , the beefily affable manager of that Pye-Charian house , the Dickens . " Sure , it 's a swell idea , Myron , and do n't let these crepe hangers tell you anything different , " crowed jimmy . " You 'll put it over , and then you 'll go on and build others , till you have a whole Lake Placid of your own  --  that is , if you want to take the trouble , and I 'll bet you wo n't . You 'll have too much fun just running a good small placep343with a high-grade clientele and swell grub , and be able to call your soul your own and get out and breathe a little fresh air and catchum a fish whenever you feel like it . Swell idea ! Like to do it myself , by golly , instead of holding the fevered hands of four hundred stockbrokers twentyfourhours a day ! " It did not occur to Myron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingness to inherit Myron 's position , when he should be gone . P344Chain of garages , to be as well known as chains of groceriesE restaurants . All auto tourists wd use them , because know them dependable . And adv in wholesale purchasing . E WOULD call it the " Black Thread Inn . " He would be so wise as not to expect any gratitude from Black Thread Center for bringing them this new industry , which might employ some scores of natives . He was even willing , or so he told himself , to have his old schoolmates , who now remembered him so well and whom he had so blankly forgotten , scold at him as one who was trying to " high-hat " them . Just the same , it would be doing something for his boyhoodhome to create there this mold of fashion and glass of form . But he would be careful not to take any credit , or to become boastful if he should succeed in making a GrandTrianon . He 'd be the same blunt , unassuming business P345man he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be imaginative , idealistic , original . The Frigate Haven Manor had , in cottages and main building , three hundred and ten bedrooms . That was too large . He planned for the Black Thread Inn a hundred and twenty bedrooms , and a cottage for himself , at first , with situations plotted for a future annex and cottages to provide a hundred bedrooms more . He hastened up to Black Thread to look over his site . It was better than he thought . He talked it over with T. J. Dingle , the youngish banker of the Center , who willingly said that he would invest ten thousand dollars , and with Mrs. Dingle , who more than willingly said that when the Inn was built , Myron could count on Ted and her coming for supper every Sunday . " Get some decent food in this wilderness at last ! " " Tut ! " said Dingle . " It 's notorious that New England home food is the best in the world . " " I know , my darling . Notorious is right . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said his wife . All winter , while he was conferring with the architects about plans for the Inn , Myron was trying to give Pye and Charian a notion of what he was up to , a task rather complicatedby the fact that he did not entirely know . They could not in the least comprehend the idea of a Rose and Crown adapted to America of the late 1920 's ; they pictureda bawdy roadhouse which would be in the country only to be safely away from prying federal officers and divorce-seeking wives , and possibly for the sake of a little golf and swimming to whet the appetite between drinks . But , " Oh , I can handle ' em . They 'll get the idea when they see the place all finished . And of course I do want it to be cheery  --  only , not dissipated , " insisted Myron . He worked out the details of financing the Inn . Pye and Charian were generous enough in this gamble , as they would have been generous in sending flowers to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Nekobee property as the desired site for the Inn , at a valuation of $25,000 , though it had cost him only $io , 000 when lake sites were cheaper , to granting him four hundredextra shares in the company for his services in buildingthe Inn and assembling the staff , a salary of $12,000 a year and living quarters in a hotel cottage when the Inn should be opened . He cautiously sold his securities and his small interests in the Pye-Charian Company , Frigate Haven Manor , and Laurel Farms for slightly over $65,000 which , with the Lake Nekobee inn site appraised at $25,000 , gave him $90,000 to invest in the project . The new company was capitalized at $300,000 , with three thousand one-hundred-dollar shares , of which Myronhad thirteen hundred , Pye and Charian each eight hundred , and T. J. Dingle one hundred . . . . It was true , admitted Myron , that with their sixteen hundred shares together , Pye and Charian could outvote Dingle and himself , but what did that matter ? They 'd be so delighted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would never interfere , and in five or six years he 'd buy them out , and if they made a nice piece of change in profit , why , he 'd beP347tickled to death  --  they 'd deserve it for being so generous at the beginning . Everything rosy ! The actual assets , then , were $250,000 of the $300,000 , and if the stock could be called " watered " at all , since they were allowing for the experience and influence of Myron alone , it was only to the extent of $5o,000 . Myron calculatedthat it would cost $220,000 to build a **27;2277;TOOLONG and lay out the grounds and lake shore , and $8o,000 for furnishing and equipment and losses until they should begin to make a profit . It was agreed that they would obtain a $50,000 mortgage , but not until the building should be finished . Myron was against shoestring methods , and Dick Pye more or less agreed . ( Actually , of course , the building , furnishings , and reserveagainst loss took $40,000 more than had been expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend and adviser , Colonel Ormond L. Westwind , took care of all that . ) Myron had to train as his successor in the management of the Pye-Charian Hotels a newcomer from Chicago . Jimmy Shanks , who had hoped for the place and who suspected that Myron had advised against him  --  " which I did , but the damn fool has no right to go around saying I did ! " Myron confided to Alec  --  was not pleased . But Jimmy was no cultured and childish Carlos Jaynes . He was friendlier and jollier and more uproarious with Myron than ever , and much more dangerous . He had to see the European inns and restaurants before he approved the architects ' plans or let them build one cement form for the Inn . He had to . He was going to combinewith American tradition everything in European hotel practice that could be acclimated here . Pye and Charian agreed to his taking three months in Europe , in the spring of 1926 , but at his own expense . Europe ! He was going to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauties , such as the Savoy , the Embassy Club , the Smithson &; Batty Hotel Furnishings Co. , the Cafe Royal , Simpson 's , the Cheshire Cheese , Foyot 's , Voisin 's , the Paris Ritz and Crillon and Meurice , a bottle of Vouvray , Ciro 's , the International Wall TapestryCie. , the Chambertin vineyard , the Tour d'Argent , the Adlon , the Stephanie , the Frankfurt A/M , Wurst Gesellschaft , the Beau Rivage of Lausanne , the Villa D'Este , the Albergo Russia of Rome , the Royal Augustan Antipasto Exportation Company , the Grand of Stockholm  --  everything in Europe that mattered . He might even have time for Westminster Abbey , Napoleon 's Tomb , Pompeii , and an art gallery . The passionate pilgrimage ! He had his plans quite ready before he told Effie May , on a February evening at home in Mount Vernon . He was jubilant about it , and he wound up , " We 'll simply have one whale of a good time , to say nothing of learning a whole lot , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels and so on that I 'll have to see , you can stay in Paris or Rome . " But she looked doubtful . She did not say " Won'erful . " She hesitated , " Could we take Luke ? "   " Not awfully well , and I do n't think he 'd enjoy it , moving so fast  --  get pretty tired , a kid of nine . " " I could n't leave him for three whole months  --  more than three , with the steamer . " " Well , I 'll try to work it out so we can take him , if you feel we ought to . He could stay in Paris with you , I guess . There 's a lot of things he 'd enjoy seeing . " " But " Do n't you want to go , pie ? " " I guess I do . Europe ! ButHe saw , beyond escape , that she was agitated by the fear of losing her familiar security , the fear of the unknown and probably hostile . He was wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had no liking whatever for the matrimonial experiments of the day . Experimentation in business was enough for him , in which he was not notably inferior to the biologists or explorers who flirted with every new concept in biology or jungle-piercing but were conservativeas boiled codfish in religion and politics and love . He wanted Europe less for himself than for the egotistic utter unselfishness of seizing it in his two hands and showingit to her . " But you had a great time out of going to Bermuda ! " he said . " Yes , I know . But I was young then . And I did n't have any responsibilities  --  a house and a child and all . And --  " Oh , probably I 'd have a fine time , once I got there and got used to it . But you 're planning to go in just three weeks  --  three weeks  --  oh , I could n't possibly get ready as quick as that  --  a trunk and dresses and underclothes and reading it up and all  --  I could n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell dresses in the Old Coun-try ! " " Oh , no , no , no ! I could n't do it ! " He saw that she was becoming actively terrified . " You run over by yourself , and Luke and I will go with you some time when you can make a longer stay , and when he 's older ! " " Sure , sure , lamb , whatever you 'd like ! Play game of pinochle tonight ? " He would n't go at all then . Rats ! He could get all he needed out of books and magazine articles . Just for once , he scolded himself , why not do something for Effie ?  --  the poor kid , buried here with nothing to amuse her ! He did not listen to himself . He had to go . He could do no other . He was on the promenade deck of the S. S. Duilio , to sail for Naples . At a cry of " All ashore that 's going ashore ! " he said tremulously to Effie May and Alec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting off . I wish you were going . It wo n't be any fun without you two to cuss and discuss with . Be good , you two , and do n't take any wooden money . Oh , Lord , I do wish you were going ! Why do n't you just get carried off accidentally on purpose ? Well , guess you better start ! " He kissed Effie , not as a husband , as he had done of late years , but with a real kiss , overwhelmingly conscious of her lips , and fretfully he led her toward the gangplank . He wondered afterward if he had n't hurried her a bit . Still , it was just as well ; it was only another half-hour be-P351fore the gangplank slid across to the pier , cutting off America forever . The great steamer incredibly began to move  --  only it seemed , on that steel immensity , that it was the pier that was moving . He waved tirelessly to Effie and Alec , standingout in the crowd as though they were each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Who had so understanding a wife , so loyal a friend ? And it pleased him that good old Jimmy Shanks , though he could not stay , had dashed down to say good-bye and bring a box of cigars . Now the end of the pier was moving backward from the steamer . He could not make out Effie and Alec . He was suddenly desolated with loneliness , with a fear that he would never see them again , with a speculation as to whether he was not a fool to leave his familiar work and to go thus pretentiously spying into foreign ways that he would never understand . He was so lonely that he went to bed early  --  and slept beautifully , for nine hours ; his longest sleep , he remembered , for he did accurately remember such things , since he had been down with the ' flu , before his marriage . Next morning he sent his business card to the chief steward . All the rest of the crossing , he was viewing refrigerator rooms , electric grills , the decoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chief steward , the stewards ' quarters , the choice and making of the sandwiches for the ten-o'clock evening trays , the storage of linen . He was busy and happy , and only occasionally did he remindhimself that he must be lonely . He took time to look at Gibraltar , but he really did not have time to look , as he had planned , at the bridge , the captain , or the Atlantic Ocean . He had written to Luciano Mora with a good deal of reserve . After all , Luciano was n't just a Westward room clerk any more , but manager of the lordly Hotel Pastorale in Naples , and probably he was nibbled to death by guests whom he had known in New York , just as Myron had been pestered by clients who , because they had once seen him at Connecticut Inn or Tippecanoe Lodge , expected to get a couple of floors free . He was pleased when Luciano radioed , on the last day out : " Keys of Napoli yours shall be at pier . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and , gaping at the revelation of Vesuvius and the amphitheater of Naples , he meditated , " Golly , I knew Europe would be quaint and old and all that , but I did n't expect such grand scenery , except maybe in the Alps . I wonder if those big white blobs are hotels ? Dandy situation ! " Luciano Mora was not on the pier  --  he was suddenly and mysteriously on the ship , while they were docking , and yelping as youthfully as when he had been a baggage porter at the Westward , " Myron , this is splen-did ! I present to you Italy ! How are Effie and the boy and Alec ? It was so too bad about old Mark ! . . . Luigi ! Mr. Weagle 's luggage ! . . . He will see it through the customs and take it to your rooms . Come ! " ( Luciano was the only person in Italy who could masterP353Myron Weagle 's amusing foreign name . To everyone else it was " Mee-ron Vee-ag-ley . " ) Myron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete inefficiency in the Pastorale . He was a little astonished by the English and by the swiftness of the porter , who had the baggage in Myron 's suite fifteen minutes after his arrival ; he was astonished by the magnificenceof Luciano 's Isotta-Fraschini car and its uniformedchauffeur , by their speed through the streets , and later , by their exceeding great speed when Luciano took him down to Amalfi and Sorrento . He had always understood that only the free and dashing Americanos drove fast ; he was to learn that any crippled centenarian in Italy , Paris , or Germany would feel disgraced if he drove a car at an average of less than a hundred kilometers an hour or if he regarded a skid as worth noticing . He found the lobby of the Pastorale too small and , with its chairs of yellow satin , too like a drawing room ; he found the elevators creaky and much too small . But he was again astonished , even a little embarrassed , as though he had been caught lying , by the leather-and-marble splendor of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bathroomwith a mosaic of nymphs in blue and green and pink on a golden ground , and conveniences new even to a plumbing expert like himself . He was astonished at the speed with which a floor waiter appeared when Luciano rang for him , astonished at his bowing and murmuring , " Si , Commendatore . " He decided that Commendatore must be some kind of a title . Luciano with a title ! Was he a Sir ? And do you suppose he had the title all the while he was in America , and him so chummy and all ? And here he was , the director of a hotel in which the smallest bedroom was the size of a Waldorfballroom . Pretty nearly . Seemed so , anyway . And yet Luciano  --  " Commendatore " !  --  he was chattering just like in the old days ! " Myron , did you remember the time we send Carlos Jaynes a loffly bottle of Scotch that was filled with ginger ale ? " There were vain interludes during which Myron felt that he was not learning much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Luciano took him to Capri , but they spent only a couple of hours on the kitchens and offices of the Hotel Quisisana , for Luciano insisted on talking about views and on dragging Myron out for a monstroustwo-hour walk , all up and down hill , to the entirely disorderly and useless ruins of a villa or castle or something that had belonged to a Roman emperor whom Luciano called " Timberio . " It was kind of interesting to see a floor of tiles which , Luciano claimed , was almost two thousand years old , and yet scarcely worn . But still ! Myron had only three months in Europe . And no matter what Luciano said , he did n't remember learning in school about an emperornamed Timberio . There had been Julius Cesar and Augustus Casar and Mark Antony and Marcus , or something like that , Aurelius . And Nero , of course , who had fiddled while Rome was burning . But no Timberio , never . But then , probably it was just a Wop translation of some regular name . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , either  --  all that decade  --  unless you counted ten miles or so a day through hotel corridors and kitchens . P355Luciano gave for him a dinner to all the hotel dignitaries in Naples and the neighborhood  --  managers and owners and chief clerks from the Grand , the Excelsior , Bertolini 's , the Bristol , Parker 's , the Britannique , the Eden , the Victoria , the Santa Lucia , the Quisisana . Half of them seemed , to Myron 's romantic delight , to be Commendatores or Cavalieres , and he wondered if a Garden Party at BuckinghamPalace would n't be very much like this  --  only not so many black beards and rotund white waistcoats . So , sitting between Commendatore Luciano Mora and the owner of a pension ( which meant a boarding house ) who was apparently a Conte ( which seemed to be an even higher title than Commendatore , though it did n't sound half so swell ) , Myron actually tasted the Animelle di Vitello alla Minuta con Tartuffi of which he had read when he was meat cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilded plaster cupid on the ceiling of the private dining room quivered to the vehemence with which the podesta , the mayor , no less , shouted that the whole city was humbly honored to greet Meeron Veeagley , who was not only the lifelong friend of Commendatore Mora but the noblest example this season of American efficiency and hospitality , and a witness of the historic friendship between America and the entirely new and improved Italy . Seven of them saw him off at the station , and Myron was sorry to leave Luciano , and impressed with the porter 's linguistic skill as he handled the luggage . He spoke Italian so rapidly ! He saw , in Italy , Switzerland , France , and England , everything that he had longed for as being cultured and of good repute . And he saw distinguished small-city restaurants  --  invariably , it seemed , personally conducted by that ubiquitous superman , the former chef of the Kaiser  --  of which he had never heard . Having been reliably informedthat Europe was very small , he was perplexed to find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel , he was able to have only a week in Germany and Austria , and unable to see Scotland , Ireland , Scandinavia , Holland , Belgium , Spain , Hungary , Poland , or the Balkans at all , though , with the accurate planning for which he was known in the hotel world , he had designed to do them thoroughly , with three full days devoted to Spain alone . " Whew ! " he said , as his steamer left Southampton , " I 've got enough ideas to last a lifetime ! But I wo n't be sorry to get back . I do believe I 'm a little tired ! . . . Funny how many top-notch European hotels have toothpicks right on the table ! " He spent hours in his cabin , filling up two new volumes of " Hotel Project Notes . " He concluded that the European system was better in room service , in the guest 's pressing a button instead of telephoning , and in having one garcon , who came to know his ways , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the food was as much better as had been fabled , because of more time taken in preparation , more patience with the processes of even a simple consomme , training of a lifetime among cooks and , as to the guests themselves , more knowing palates and freedom from the superstition that the world will fail if the office is not reopened promptly at 2:01 p.m.  --  though what any-P357body could do about it , in a large American city dining room , where the guests expected to have lunch and dash away in twenty-five minutes , he did not see . He liked the Continental habit of eating outdoors , in an arbor or on the sidewalk , whenever it was possible , and this custom he would have at the Black Thread Inn . Yet he vehemently did not , like the professional expatriates , believe the worst European inn was better than the best American hotel . He had found plenty of bad hotels . He had known supercilious porters ; managers who never left their stinking little offices but hid there always with their beards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being chummily informed about the weather ; cashiers who refused to charge a fiftyfranctelegram on the bill , and bills on which the taxes were invariably overcharged ; restaurants which had never heard of veal , and restaurants in other lands which had never heard of anything except veal ; barkeeps who believed that ice in a whisky-soda was against all the principlesof the English Constitution  --  and also , that the only purpose of American visitors was to conform to the principlesof the English Constitution ; English reception clerks who could scarcely endure speaking to a strange guest without an introduction by the vicar 's aunt and who had to be wooed before they would admit that , in a completely untenanted inn , there were rooms for rent ; French cashiers w ho went hysterical over ten centimes but remained admirablycalm about a few millions of war debt and , in no case , even when he was a guest , thought much of a son of Uncle Shylock ; Italian stewards who could not respect anyone who did not care to fill up like a balloon on ravioli before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans understood that , after the our-1 ' rageous charges in their own country , they were lucky to be able to get a room for twelve dollars a day ; German and Austrian clerks who chuckled , " In Dollars ist es nur ein Bagatelle " ; caravansaries with original Holbeins and no hot water except on Saturdays from 5:3o to 6:17 p.m. ; hotels with marble floors and total absence of heating  --  generously provided as ways of counteracting the tropical temperature of 38  --  Fahrenheit on a March morning ; damp napkins ; Italians who believed that cuttlefish are edible , Germans who regarded pig 's knuckle as a vegetarian health food , and Englishmen who had the same high opinionsof wilted lettuce , tripe , and gooseberry tart drowned in custard ; German guests who despised the French , French guests who despised the Italians , Italian guests who despised the English , English guests who despised everybody , and American guests who despised only all the other Americans , but so wholeheartedly as to make up for their narrowness . He had quaked in dancing elevators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model of the Sahara on brocade chairs , and been racked on beds stuffed with damp seaweed . And once , though once only , he had found a French hotel with a filthy tablecloth , paper napkins , and chicken which could have been used for chips to kindle a fire . Yet it had been the passionate pilgrimage he had prayed for . He would not forget hotel terraces looking on the Alps and the Bay of Naples , nor the salmon at Macon , nor the boiled beef with Schnittlauch sauce at Madame Sacher 's . P359But he privately jigged as he steamed toward his own na- tive varieties of poetry  --  toward American elevators and circulating ice water and telephones that worked , all- r night service , and corn pudding , and adjustable heating and free daily papers that were newspapers , and Alpine views from thirtieth-story windows , the American belief that quick-laundry service did not require special permits from the police , and the even more surprising belief that coffee should be served hot and should , preferably , be made from coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he melancholy , as he groaned , " Good Lord , I knew I forgot something !

Myron 's cottage was ready in May , and the Inn formally opened on JuneP36110 , 1927 . Myron gave half his time , during this year , to the Pye-Charian Hotels in New York ; the other half he divided between nagging the builders , and selecting and training his staff , which seemed to him rather more important than the building . From the Pye-Charian organization he took only two officers : Clark Cleaver , chief clerk of the Walter Scott , for assistant manager and chief clerk of the Inn , and Otto Gritzmeier as chef . In so small a place , Otto was an extravagance , even though he was willing to come for three hundred a year less than he had in the steamy bedlam of the Victor Hugo . Myron was happily able to hire his brother , Ora , to write publicity during most of the building . He had always felt guilty at doing so little for Ora , who just now happened to be rather hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hidden Sex Truths Book PublishingCompany for having offered to teach hidden sex truths to the stenographers . Before the Inn opened , Ora sold a series of very interesting " Confessions of a Press Agent " to a muckraking magazine , and was able to take a richly deserved rest and trip to Europe , to the satisfaction of Myron , who had always regretted that while a mere business man like himself had had that opportunity , it had hitherto been denied to Ora , with his splendid knowledge of history and literature . As permanent press agent and " host " of the Inn , Myron hired Benny Rumble , hotel-news correspondent of Smart Mart . He did not like Benny , a dapper little young man , with a smirk and clothes too well fitted around the hips , given to dancing , bridge , poetic quotations , and rose- tipped cigarettes , but Dick Pye insisted that Benny would be just the lad to entertain the old ladies at the Inn , and absolutely safe with the young ladies . The headwaiter was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective  --  always known as " hotel dick "  --  was Dutch Linderbeck from the Fishkill House of Albany , who was said to know more politicians more gloomily than even the Capitol janitor . For a hundred-and-twenty-room hotel , a detective was not necessary , but Myron wanted to protect the wealthy guests he was presumably going to have against every manner of confidence-man and fake Russian prince . A yet greater extravagance was the veteran floor waiters . His whole scheme of superior service would fail if guests , when they rang the bell , were answered by the amiable but untrained college students on vacation whowere the bellboys and waiters in most summer hotels . The experienced guest wanted the bell answered by an initiate , to whom the procuring of coffee , stamps , aspirin , or wrapping paper and cord , was a passionate duty . For a month before the opening , Myron and his lieutenantsdrilled the kitchen staff , the waiters and busboys , the desk clerks and bellboys and telephone girls and porters , and even the cigar-and-candy-stand girl , and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could learn , Myron was pleased at having it happen so early , and hired another young lady . The chambermaids had blueprints of what ought to be in every room every day ; precisely what must daily be swept , dusted . Theyp363were dragooned as thoroughly as chorus girls  --  though they were expected to be more charming than chorus girls during working hours and considerably less so after hours . The whole Inn would open as smoothly as though it had been running for five years . Myron did not remember it , but he was carrying out vows he had made amid the deliriums of Tippecanoe Lodge , twenty years before . His chief trouble in organizing the staff was in refusing the offers of Black Threaders whom he had known as boys . He would have hated himself had he been supercilious to men with whom he had once smoked cornsilk cigarettes in the livery stable ; he was uncomfortably and almost too noisily cordial when they came poking about the rising walls of the Inn ; but he tried to persuade them that their training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoestore had n't really qualified them to clerk in an expensive hotel , an occupation which they picturedas doing nothing all day long but wear lovely new tailcoats and shake hands and swap dirty stories with fashionable guests . Myron heard , seven times a day , " Sure , I know : you 've gotten too good for your old friends . Your hat has got too small for you , since you went off to the city . " He explained to himself , " Anybody with the intelligence of a rabbit would have known that I was a fool to start this thing too near the old home town . You are n't very bright , Myron . You work hard , but you have n't got much intuition or inspiration . That 's what Ora 's told me , all along . Oh , damn Ora ! Now , the old bunch here in the Center will want me to fail . Oh , well , damn them , too ! Nobody can stop me , nothing can stop me , from making this the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a reservation a year ahead ! " It was in such a mood of boastful depression that he determined to get even with the Fates by raising the minimumrate-per-day , room and meals , from twelve to fifteen dollars . His old acquaintances , who remembered him so much more lovingly than seemed probable after twenty-eight years , continued to come around and , when he was most trying to be affectionate and very joky , they drawled , " Now do n't try to pull any high-hat stuff on me ! I knew you when you was empting slops at the American House ! " He had some thirty local workmen employed in building , and when the Inn opened , he would use as many people from Black Thread as showed themselves willing to keep their shoes blacked and endure strict training . But he saw that to one faction he must forever continue to be an ingratewho " pulled high-hat stuff . " " Cheer up , " said T. J. Dingle ; " consider what they think of me , the blood-sucking banker ! " His father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that old Tom ever bothered him by presenting his qualifications for working at the Inn . Tom was entirely satisfied with his present two hours a day of supervising the American House clerk . But he did come over to Lake Nekobee to tell the workers that he was Myron 's dad and had taught Myron all he knew , and to direct them in their building . All that , Myron could settle easily enough . He set his mother onP365Tom , and thereafter his father stayed home , grumbling to all guests whom he could persuade to listen that a serpent'stooth is nothing at all compared with a thankless child , and that throughout Myron 's youth , half a century or so , he had risen at five daily to instruct his ungrateful son in every art of innkeeping . But Myron 's mother was beatific . Now , as the Black Thread Inn advanced , she knew absolutely , where formerlyshe had only suspected , that her son was the greatest hotelman the world had ever known , and late afternoons , guiltily leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook , she walked arm in arm with Myron about the scaffolding-covered walls , while he triumphantly showed the future terrace , sun porch , cabanas , squash court . Naturally , Professor Herbert Lambkin , B.A. , M.A. , was the worst pest of all . The moment Myron began to build , Herbert charged in with suggestions . Myron must come stay with them at the Old Home . Thanks , no . Myron was perfectly comfortable at the American House . Besides . He had to be in New York so much  --  only spent a few nights at the Center . Well , look here , then . Did Myron remember that conceitedfool , Monlux , who had offered Herbert a miserable thirty a week in New York ? Herbert had always been pretty sore about that , and he did n't entirely absolve Myron from blame , and now was Myron 's chance to make up for the insult . He , Herbert , as superintendent of schools , was free in the summertime , just when Myron would most need him in the Inn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serve as assistant manager for seventyfiveor eighty a week , and then he thought he might bring himself to forgive Monlux , Myron , Effie , and Heaven . No . . . . Myron was so sorry . . . . But he had already chosen his whole staff . That was only the beginning of happy talks between the brothers-in-law . Myron reported it to Effie May , in Mount Vernon , but for once she did not back him . " Why , I think that 's real mean of you ! It would mean so much to Berty to have the job ; it would please him like anything , and I think it 's horrid giving all these dandy jobs to complete strangers when our own family need them ! " " He is n't trained  --  he has n't the temperament  --  he 'd make lots of trouble , " Myron said feebly . But he was considerablyless feeble when he returned to Black Thread and Herbert again pounced . Then Herbert granted that if Myron would build a summer cottage for him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone only , he would forgive Myron to a considerable extent and try to forget his origin . Back in Mount Vernon again , Myron suffered with a pity for her that was purest love when Effie May cried , " Listen , duckie ! If you 'll give Herbert the job , like he wants , I 'll turn in and help you , with ideas ! I 've been thinking them up all this week you 've been gone . Listen ! This would be just won'erful ! Why not have a great big picnic ground , with big rustic tables , and get all the SundaySchools for miles around to have their basket picnics there every summer ! Of course you could n't charge them , P367but it would make the Inn grounds so lively , and advertise the place like anything ! And the question of liquor , that to any hotel project in 1926 was a sick headache . Myron had planned space for a bar in the basement billiard room of the Inn , and he intended , if Prohibition should be repealed , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expect to interfere with guests who brought their own flasks and were not too noisy . But on the other hand he would not sell any illicit liquor , or permit any employee to sell it . Then Mr. Everett Beasy came to him , and Mr. Everett Beasy was the sheriff of the county . He did not resemble the sheriffs of fiction ; he had neither chin whiskers combined with shrewdness in finding which tramp had fired the barn , nor a leather vest and a notched six-gun . He had been a respectable grocer , and he still looked like a respectablegrocer : a small man in a well-pressed pepper-andsaltsuit and a new derby . " Well , Weagle , fine thing for the whole country round here , your putting up this big hotel . Give work to lots of needy folks , and set an example of nice living for all our young people . " " Glad you like it . " " You bet we like it . You 're a real public benefactor . And now listen . I know how it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks that will want a little drink . Mostly , of course , that 's against the law , but we do n't feel disposed to be too hard on folks that will bring good money here , as long as they behave themselves and do n't kick up any rows . If they mind their business , we 'll mind ours . But of course you want to be able to give ' em first-class stuff that you can guarantee . Now myself , I 'm agin booze , and I never touch a drop , hardly , you might say , but I know a fellow that 's a really honest bootlegger " Sha n't need one . " " Look here . I do n't know as we can allow anybody supplyingyou that we ca n't depend on . We officers of the law have got a responsibility to the public , let me tell you ! " " But I sha n't sell any liquor at all . Really . I mean it . Not a drop . " " Oh , yes you will ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if you deal with the right people , it 'll save you a lot of trouble in taxes and building inspection and any fights that drunk guests might get into and traffic charges and all sorts of things . I just want to help you out . Think it over , and when you get ready , I 'll have this fellow I know come see you . " It took Myron a time to believe that Sheriff Beasy 's honest friend was also Sheriff Beasy , and that a country political gang could be as intimidating as any city gang in compelling him to handle illicit booze whether he wanted to or not . He thought of Beasy 's hard little eyes . He thought of the Inn being raided on a gay and prosperous evening . He shivered . By contrast he almost had relief in the details of insurance . He had , it appeared , to insure against injury to employees , injury to the public , fire , lightning , burglary , floods , earthquakes , cyclones , termites , elephantiasis , inurrection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation he had not , heP369saw , altogether freed himself from the body of sin and doubt . Yet irritated or apprehensive or dreary with details , he was , all this tiring and glorious time , uplifted by the sight of the rising Inn , the actual coming into existence of his masterpiece . P370Cruise : Long Island Sound steamer , two weeks up to Bar Harbor or beyond , exploring shores of Conn , Mass , L. I. , Nantucket , etc . Anchor in quiet harbor every nite , with dance on deck , movies , etc. and boats going ashore , and fishing E.9 ' swimming in morning . Cd do very cheap , for summer vacation for clerks , stenogs etc . Daily lecture on history of coast . Specialize sea food  --  " catch your own mackerel E we 'll cook it for you . " How about campfire on big iron plate , asbestos lined , on deck one evening of each cruise ? To MAKE an inn that should be not merely good but near perfection , Myron asserted , he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to make himself an expert equally on the plan of the building in regard to convenience , quiet , light , and view , on the furnishingof bedrooms and public rooms , on food , linen , silver , china , glass , on amusements outdoors and inside . In any one of these departments , the Black Thread Inn mightp371be surpassed ; it was his job , as creative builder , to make sure that no other inn should surpass his in the combination of all the details . All day , when he was not at Black Thread , he was consultinginterior decorators , salesmen for hotel china and glass , books on furniture and , always , the realistic and experienced Mr. Otto Gritzmeier . As to decoration , he was for a while tempted by the heathen ritual of Modernism ; particularly after he had lunched at the Tall Town Club , the best speakeasy in New York , which had been bedizened by Josef Lazaraki with a circular bar of black glass edged with a silver band , bright aluminum bar stools with red-leather seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powdery blue background , walls splashed with sunbursts and torchflames of aluminum , and sunflowers whose petals were mirrors , Myron was impressed . Prohibition , he realized , had been an excellent thing for America : it had not only taught the traditionally unalcoholic American woman to drink and smoke with her men , but had , in its freedom from old standards , encouraged the arousing orgies of modernistic decoration , and all citizens , especially the surprised and delighted women , ought to be grateful to the Methodist and Baptist shepherds who had brought on Prohibition . But for his inn among New England hills , this jazz splendor would be false , and Myron was equally uninterested in the other extreme : an Olde Inne that should be a Colonial museum , with huge and dirty brick fireplaces bristling with sooty cranes , straight-backed oak chairs , and walls so prickly with warming pans , candle molds , revolutionary muskets , grandfather clocks , Wedgwood platters , grimy iron pots , and Currier &; Ives prints that any honest guest would dash out shrieking . He decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gracefulfor summer , warm-hued for winter firelight , and he was able to have all of it made by one manufacturer , at a comfortingly reasonable price . He was able to get standard yet not too familiar patterns of glassware , china , and silver which harmonized with the mahogany . They were all marked with the BTI embroidered on the linen . Not even the lounge , center of the Inn , was planned so carefully as the kitchens , and these were planned to the last centimeter , as though he were devising a new motor engine . In everlasting headachy conferences with Gritzmeier , after reading everything he could find in the hotel magazines , he arranged exactly what and how long should be the path from refrigerator to work table , to condiment cupboard , to stove , to serving bar , to dining room ; what materials were best for sinks , for table tops , floors , and the weary swollen feet of cooks . Food he studied as Duke Godfrey studied the imaginativemaps to the Holy Land . Gritzmeier was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native American foods to his knowledge of French and German and British cookery . As piously as Myron he revered the American dishes which would be the staples of this good provincial inn : clam chowder , planked shad with roe , crab flakes , canvas-back with wild rice and black currant jelly , raisin pie , corn pones , pepper pot , and the breakfast doughnuts and waffles and buckwheat cakes which can be so delicate or so leaden , in accordance as the cook is a worthy man or a scoundrel . P373To " amusements " he gave scientific research . He had noticed that the chief horror of summer hotels in the evening , when it is too dark for golf and swimming , is that there is nothing to do . He would have either dancing or a movie , or both , every evening , along with radio , backgammon , dice racing , masquerades , a large library , moonlightpicnic suppers , billiards ; and a chief job of Benny Rumble would be to introduce poker players and bridge maniacs to one another . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myron 's cottage , which was to be the start of a whole crescent of hotel cottages on '  --  5ie hillside above the Inn . He had planned it himself , more precisely than any known house wife , with everything built in that could be built in , with composition floors that could be cleaned with a look , and enough sleeping-porch space for his family and for a guest ... only he hoped that the guest would not too constantly be Professor Herbert Lambkin , M.A.It was May 27th , 1927 , just two weeks before the day set for the opening , and the Black Thread Inn was finished  --  at least as nearly finished as it would be this season  --  and Myron could look upon his Works , bound in gray shingle . The Inn fitted into the hillside . It was rather long and low , with wide dormers in the third story . The sides were finished in fireproofed shingles , stained the soft gray of the sunless lake , with the shingled roof a little darker , and under the eaves was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiles was cut in under the building , on the ground floor , and extended outside along the whole length of the front , with French windows opening on it , with white wicker chairs and white-painted steel tables . Here lunch and tea were to be served on bright days . At one end was an untouched grove of elms and maples ; at the other end was planted a garden of roses , peonies , and autumnal lilies , where tea would also be served when the garden should have grown . The tennis courts , the squash courts , the stables of ridinghorses , the garage , with titanic busses to meet the trains , were tucked among the woods behind the Inn , and here , next winter , would be a ski slide and possibly a toboggancourse . Golf was available at the Olde Mill Country Club , four miles away , and at three other clubs within eight miles . Some day the Inn would have a nine-hole course of its own . Myron had insisted on laying out , on one of the lawns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically , rushed up to assure him that croquet was dead . There was to be a swimming pool , warmed , for early spring and late autumn , when the lake would be too cold , but as yet there was only the excavation for the pool . It would be finished in the fall . The sandy lake shore was kaleidoscopic as the Riviera , with a huge T-shaped dock , four diving boards , yellow and crimson canoes , rowboats with blue and crimson awnings , and cabanas with awnings gray and crimson . Only the beach was garish , however ; the Inn itself was tranquil . " Well , " grumbled Tom Weagle , " it 's all right , but strikes me it 's a pretty simple shack to be making such a fuss over ! Why did n't you make one of these FrenchP375chateaux , or a Japanese garden , or something with class ? " " I planned it to be simple . I want it to fit in between the lake and the hill as if it had grown here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested Myron . " It 's simple , all right ! It just growed , all right ! It certainlydo n't look like any good two hundred and twenty thousand bucks to me . What I could have done with that money , with my experience ! Built you a hotel that 'd bat you in the eye ten miles off . Just growed here on the hill is right ! Like a doggone ole gray stump ! After all the pains I 've spent on you , I 've never been able to learn you it pays to advertise ! " June tenth , then , and the publication of the Perfect Inn . It was opening with every bedroom full save one , and that empty only because it was held for Adolph Charian , Pye 's partner , who might or might not be able to come from New York for the ceremonies . Dick Pye would be there all week . Myron had had to reject more than sixty applications for rooms . He had captured for the first five days of the opening the convention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute . Benny Rumble , the natty press agent , had lavishlyinvited the press to the opening of what he asserted to be the finest inn on the Atlantic Coast , and fifteen rooms were reserved for reporters from New York , Philadelphia , Boston , New Haven , Hartford , Bridgeport , and Greenwich , who did not mind submitting a few sticks to the society editors so long as the food and Benny 's private stock were good . The other rooms were taken by a miscel-P293and Moselle ( that was a German wine ) and vodka ( that was a kind of Russian white mule ) and a lot of other things , but all with fruit juice , so it did n't seem strong , but Mrs. Koreball warned her  --  she must be careful , Mrs. Koreball told her , not to drink too much , because it was awfully strong and she could n't have her new friend Effie get cockeyedat this first party , she said , and she laughed like anything , and kissed Effie , and her eyes were naughty but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve to do , Mrs. Weagle ? I called up your handsome husband , and he says maybe he 'll drop in , too . " " Oh , I hope he does ! " " You still like him ? " " Oh , I think he 's marvelous  --  so strong and you can depend on him and everything . But it is so hard to get him to go to a party before seven . They keep him so busy in the Front Office . " " He 's the handsomest thing ! " " Oh , do you think so , Mrs. Koreball ? I suppose he is , but what I always think of first is how he 's so strong , and so sort of dependable . Of course he does look kind of clean and all , like he did wash behind the ears , but handsomeNow a handsome man is like that Duke of Essex or Earl of something or whatever he was in Queen Elizabeth . That was a picture that " Yes , I know . I saw it . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must meet the Bunch . " Round the punch bowl was simply the nicest group of people Effie May had ever met  --  oh , of course , except Myron and Luciano and Alec . The men had such lovely diagonally barred ties , and two of them wore spats , though quite a few of them , unfortunately , were bald . The funniestone was a short little man with a red face that he screwed up like a monkey , but you just had to like him , he was so funny . " My Lord , it 's Helen of Troy herself ! " he screamed , when Effie was introduced , and everybody laughed , so pleasantly . Fortunately Effie knew that Helen of Troy was a very beautiful woman , who was named Helen and who lived in Troy , which was in ancient Greece , so she did not feel embarrassed . " Come on , Helen , time for another glass , " said the monkey man . " Oh , I 've just had one , and I 'm afraid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockeyed ! " " Nonsense ! It 's just orange juice with just a wee , tiny touch of dynamite and maybe a trace of carbolic acid ! Come hither , lovely one , and let us converse ! " He took her arm , guided her to a couch covered with purple brocade , and chattered , " My name is Harry Burphy , and what , my rose of Sharon , is your monicker ? I did n't catch it when our fair hostess threw you to us lions . " " My name is Effie May Weagle . Is n't it just the silliest name ! " She giggled . " Well , Effie May , when are you going to have lunch with me ? I 've got the slickest imported Italian auto in town , and even if it is winter now , I think it would be fun to run up the Hudson to Ye Bunche of Grapes some noon . What say ? Good Lord , what lovely fingers you have ! Why , I 've never seen such lovely fingers as you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , modern , intellectual women that bothered you with deep questions , Bertha Spinney had hopes for Effie 's social career . As they rocked together on the Frigate Haven Manor terrace , knitting bright scarfs which no one would ever wear , Bertha hinted , " If you ever got divorced from Myron , how much alimony do you think you could get ? " " Get divorced ? Get divorced from Myron ? Why ! I 'd never dream of such a thing ! I love him like anything ! Ummmm ! I could just hug him to death ! " " Oh , yes , of course , my dear ! I did n't mean Do n't be silly ! I just meant , I was thinking about alimony in general . Women have to stand together . I never went out for the vote and women 's rights and all that silly rot , but I do remember  --  I was so interested , I heard Dr. Malvina Worrnser , this lady doctor , lecturing , and it 's just as she said , women must stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them , and what I meant was Of course Myron and you will get away with it , but I do think every lady ought to know about these things , so that  --  so she can advise others ! Just like a lady friend of mine that was the first to put me wise that you always got to keep men waiting and guessing , or else they 'll take advantage of you . And what I was thinking of : if you ever have a friend that 's going to get divorced , you just keep right after her , and what is most important , make sure she does n't sign any contract so her alimony ceases if she gets remarried . That 's where these dirty dogs of Ex 's get you ! You have to watch ' em like a hawk ! Of course the second or third time you might marry somebody that 's richer than the first one was , but on the other hand , you might want to marry some nice boy that was n't just mean and penny-pinching and commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly support himself , let alone you , but was so kind and loving you did n't mind , and then , of course , you 'd want to go on getting your income and not give your Ex a chance to cut it off , the dirty hog ! And serve him right , too ! I tell you , a girl that 's been married to a man , any man , and given herself to him , and stood for his nasty tempers and his disgusting habits and his behaving the way he does , so he prevents you from going on and taking your rightful place in social circles , I tell you you 've earned your share of his cash , and it 's your right and duty to go on compelling him to give you your just rights , and if he 's been fool enough to go and make new marital arrangements in the meantime , why , that 's just his hard luck  --  he certainly never consulted you about it ! So that 's how I mean . If anything should ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , or I 'll be the most surprisedgirl that ever lived ! " " Oh , no-o ! I hope and pray that Myron and I will-alwaysstick to each other ! " She did not like Bertha Spinney , just then . She was inexplicablyafraid . She wished that Myron were there , to protect her , to explain away the hints of danger she felt in the Spinney 's toothily smiling confidences ! She had a won'erful idea ! She would run into New York tomorrow , to surprise him , and stay with him till the next Saturday . But the day after was so hot , and Bertha had planned a swimming party.
