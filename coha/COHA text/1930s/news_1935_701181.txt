txt Recovery in Automobiles . Your editorial of April 29 on the testimony of the automobile industry as to recovery is confirmed by a rather remarkable statistical fact . For fifteen years the correlation between automobile sales and the spendable income of the United States has been 94 per cent . It is certain that this is due not so much to the inherent demand for the product as to the faith , progressiveness and courage ? in fact the audacity ? of the industry , which if shared by many other Industries would have been similarly reflected in their progress in the past three years . Here and there individual companies in these other industries are to be found which have quit thinking with their emotions and with their political prejudices and which have done a job of product development , constructive advertising and intelligent selling that has literally lifted them by their bootstraps . Gradually , the timid ones will follow , but without knowledge or appreciation of the processes that have made their revival possible . W. A. M'DERMID .
