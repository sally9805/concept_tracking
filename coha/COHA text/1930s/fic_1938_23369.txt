" THE CURRENT MRS . BARNABY " A STORY BY G. B. STERN DEAR Mrs. Barnaby , I know it is distinctly odd of me to be writing to you of all people , but I am terribly concerned about Conrad who has lately begun to behave so very strangely Yes , this was the letter I had been expecting for years , ever since I heard that my ex-husband had married again . At first when we were married everything went swimmingly . But now , although only in little things , he has changed . For instance , although his elephant-gray suit is almost new and fits him beautifully , he simply refuses to wear it , but has gone out and ordered himself a brown suit and wears it all the time , although ( do n't you agree with me ? ) brown is not his color - . " With no desire to be heartless , I could hardly refrain from chuckling at a memory of how I had liked Con in navy blue , but suddenly he had dropped it for gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , but when there are other things , they mount up . In your opinion , should I have it out with him face to face , or pretend to take no notice , and pray that he will soon return again to being the dear Conrad whom I married on November 14 , 1932 , which you may remember is Leap Year , not that I attach any significance to this , but I think I had better give you full details . I should deeply appreciate any advice you can give me about Con . He always speaks of you so nicely , and as you will see by this letter , I am not at all narrowminded . Yours sincerely , Angela Dilys B. " Angela Dilys " were the Christian names of the current Mrs. Barnaby , who tactfully followed it with " B " full-stop , for fear of hurting my feelings . A nice woman , I should say . So Con was at it again ! Con the unfaithful husband , incorrigible and impenitent . He had a sort of Hollywood streak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I myself was the second Mrs. Barnaby . The first had been a deliciously pretty little fool of the same species as Angela Dilys . That was the rhythm of his infidelity : beauty , brains ; beauty , brains . I learned it while I was his wife , by giving my earnest attention to his three or four flirtations before he finally fell headlong in love with Angela . And I checked up on it by recalling how he had fallen headlong in love with me ( with no looks to speak of , but I am bound to admit in all honesty , with a reputation for being witty and intelligent ) after four years of marriage with Phyllis Elaine , to whom he used to quote Malory and Tennyson , with a romantic throb in his voice . For Con was like all the gallant knights in armor rolled into one : Roland , and Wilfred of Ivanhoe ; Launcelot and Bayard and Bertrand du Guesclin . He was handsome , chivalrous , and radiantly alive . And he could do his stuff without the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which caught me . I had been having a series of earnest intellectual admirers , and then suddenly Con dashed in like the squire in Chaucer : " He was as freshe as is the month of Ma And by the time I came to my again Phyllis Elaine had died in a motor accident . There was no need for me to feel guilty ; I doubt if as yet she had known of my existence ; she probably only thought that Con was " beginning to behave very strangely " . . . . After a decent interval I married Con . And after a still more decent interval , divorced him . Recalled to the letter , I reread the funny prim sentences , and it seemed to me that between them rang a clear cry for help , a genuine note of panic . So I telephoned and made an appointment to go to see the current Mrs. Barnaby . She had a voice like a wood-pigeon ; I should be driven mad if I had to live with it , but it was very sweet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice house in Caclogan Square . Con , I knew , had a private income of less than three hundred a year . And he only brought it up to about six hundred at his advertising job . He could stick to a job , though not to a woman . But in his job he never got any farther , whereas with women .. . I felt a little like the house detective when I leaned back in my chair and scrutinized my successor with veiled eyes : " Now please tell me everything , even what you think is of no importance . " But before that , on a sudden impulse I had put my arms round the child and warmly kissed her . I think she was a little surprised . She had burst convention sufficiently to write and tell me her troubles with my former husband ; but although 1 had released Con in a perfectly conventional way ( hotel in Brighton with a hired corespondent , chambermaid 's evidence and all the rest of it ) , the fact still remained that in Angela 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not ; therefore there was a suggestion of looseness about the former Mrs. Barnaby , to whom she was prepared to be kind and tolerant . " Thank you , " she whispered , her sedate defenses all thrown down . Then she rushed out immediately with her principal fear : that Conrad might have been told by a doctor he had only a short time to live , and that he was guarding her from this direful knowledge . " My God ! " I exclaimed , and was silent , gazing at her . So they had been married for over four years , and this was what she still thought of him ! Was there ever such a credulous goose , with her big brown eyes and her golden hair and her pansy skin and that soft quivering mouth ? Just plain goose ! " So you suppose that 's why he has been behaving strangely ? " " Oh , yes , yes . I wish I did n't . But Con is reticent , you know . " Had we been talking in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have retorted : " You 're telling me ! " As this was England , I again resumed the role of house detective , severe , keen-eyed , enigmatic , and asked for evidence . I reminded her that she had already written me that he refused to wear his pretty new elephant-gray suit , and had gone permanently into brown . " How , " I asked , " does that fit in with your theory that he 's going to die ? " The goose-girl had got it all pat : he had been wearing that gray suit when he paid his direful visit to Harley Street ; now perhaps he could riot bear the sight of it . " So he went and ordered a brown one ? Well  --  go on , what else ? " " He sighs heavily every now and then , for no reason . " " Like my Great Dane , " I put in cheerfully . Angela was not pleased with me for this . It sounded too flippant . She went on with the catalogue : He had shaved off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blotting paper , an elaboration of the letters " H.L. " recurring frequently among the usual pattern of " C.B. , " his own initials . He was abrupt in his manner to her . He vehemently refused to go to the Zoo any more , though it had been their constant habit to visit the tropical fish and birds any Sunday when they were not in the country . He was taking Italian lessons too . Last week he had picked up a necklace of aquamarines which he had given her himself some time ago ( with a charming compliment to her brown eyes ) and said : " You do n't want this , do you ? Emeralds would suit you much better . " And took it away . And she was delighted . Only she never got the emeralds . He perpetually hummed the waltz from " Rosenkavalier " and then broke off in the middle and looked self-conscious . He ? worked out on endless scraps of paper how two people could live on six pounds a week , asking her innumerable practical questions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I interrupted , " except for the heavy sighing , which might be bronchial , I fail to see how any of that fits in with your theory that he is shortly to die . Unless perhaps he has shaved off his mustache with the idea of being a more beautiful corpse . " " Oh , " gasped Angela , " how hard you are Howcruel ! To speak of it like that ! " " I 'm only hard and cruel because 1 do n't believe he 's going to be a corpse at all . Of course he may be going to have your aquamarines buried with him in the Egyptian style ; but in that case , why is he learning Italian ? " Angela replied defiantly : " To be able to read Dante . " I burst out laughing . The notion of Con mugging up his " Inferno " in the original so as to know how to address his fellow-shades when he got there was really too much for me . " I do n't see why you 're laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much longer to live . " " ' N ' for Nirvana , ' H ? for hell , " I suggested . " If it should happen to be the latter , six pounds a week would easily buy the pomegranates . " " What pomegranates ? " Angela knit her delicate brows , bewildered by the classical allusion . " But then there 's his refusal to go to the Zoo on Sunday morning . No , Mrs. Barnaby , it wo n't do . Really it wo n't . " " I wish you 'd call me Angela . It seems so indecent that we should both be calling each other Mrs. Barnaby . " " Then , Angela , it wo n't do . Have you no other theories ? " And I added , but not aloud : " Before I tell you the truth . " Because she would have to face it sooner or later . She produced another equally picturesque theory , not quite so gloomy as the first . Con 's noble nature , she thought , had revolted against living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their income was hers , and the house and everything , she added . So he had decided to leave her , to renounce love and luxury in London , to go to Hollywood and become a film star and make his fortune , so that he might return home as her equal . I agreed that that would account for the mustache , and even perhaps for the " Rosenkavalier " waltz which he might be practicing for his first audition ; and , at a stretch , some film magnate might have said : " I do n't seem to like you in gray , Mr. Barnaby ; brown 's your color . " Hollywood would account for the " H " on the blotting paper . But where , for instance , did the aquamarines come in ? She replied , a little defiantly , that it was natural to suppose he might care to take with him something she had often worn ( " next to my skin " ) to remind him of the wife he loved , when he was far away in California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , in order to lessen the shock : " The truth is , Angela , he thinks he 's in love with another woman . " I said " thinks , " hoping that that too would be of assistance . Angela stared at me with dazed eyes . Then she went very white . Then she cried out : " It is n't true . It is n't true . You only say that because you 're ? " And stopped on the word " jealous " perhaps because she read compassion in my face . She did n't cry . Goose though she was , she had a certain dignity which pleased me . She pulled herself together and asked me for proof . And giving her my proofs was far harder than making the bare statement . Still , it had to be done , because I wanted Con to be removed from this new love and returned whole and in his right mind to Angela , who was definitely the perfect wife for him . And Con could not be retrieved until Angela knew what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as gently as I could , how when I had been his wife and he had fallen in love with her he had discarded those navy-blue suits with a thin red stripe which I thought suited him so well , and insisted suddenly on wearing nothing but elephant-gray ; and how , moreover , he had sighed heavily , he and the Great Dane , and had scribbled " A.D.B. " interwoven with " C.B. " all over the blotting paper . And how he had grown a little mustache , though I preferred him without . And how he had refused to go to Kew Gardens any more with me , and later I realized it was because Angela happened to be fond of Lilac as well , and he did n't wish to meet her in my presence . And he had learned dancing though I never danced " Are you fond of dancing , Angela ? " Angela , her face averted , nodded , and squeezed her hands tightly together to help her bear it . I suddenly changed the whole tone of this really somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trumpet call to action : " Now I 'll tell you what you 're to do . " Shc needed a little persuading of course . Just as at first she had resisted the idea that Con was not a walking incarnation of " faithful-unto-death , " so , on a natural reaction , she had already lost him to H.L. , and gone to live forever alone in a little village by the sea , doing good works and adored by old and young for her broken-hearted. smile and sad brown eyes . . . " All the same , " I threw in cunningly , " I think it might be fun to get your aquamarines back again , and Con with them . She 's not his type , you know , and you are . " " She ? But you do n't know her , How can you tell what she 's like ? " " Intuition , " I replied rather lamely . Phyllis Elaine , and then , on the other swing of the pendulum , myself . And then a swing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhythm once more , myself  --  or my equivalent . I felt tenderly disposed toward Angela , but this unknown girl  --  this Hermione  --  Harriet ? Helen  --  was my peer . I could work out a plan , relying on her and what she would do and what she would guess and how she would behave then , as though we were old friends . But it was naturally a little difficult to explain the pendulum-swing without being rude to the current Mrs. Barnaby . By now she had given me nearly all the data I required . There was still one more important item : " Have you seen a lot of stuff lying about lately from travel agencies ? Folders in rich colors , azure seas and a red castle on a green hill , that sort of thing ? " She shook her head doubtfully : " 1 do n't know . I never disturb his desk . He does n't like it . " I rose briskly to my feet . " Right . Lead me to the sacred study . " The current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ex-Mrs . Barnaby might be likely to commit in order to avert the catastrophe of a future Mrs. Barnaby . But she took me to Con 's study , which had an oddly familiar look about it , although I recognized none of the furniture . It was just the way Con always contrived to give a slightly rakish tilt and slant to his things ; the angle of the chair and the lamp . . . For a moment I experienced a queer little wave of sentiment , or call it sentimentality . I threw it off : there was work to do . As a matter of course I began to rummage among his papers . " Oh , you must n't do that , " cried Angela , shocked . " Do n't fuss , child , I 've done this a million times . It 's for his own good and yours . And Hebe 's . " " Whose ? " " Hester 's . I mean Helen 's . Ah , yes , here we are . And here 's some more . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have explained before that Conrad had a geographical obsession . It had ever been his wont when ardently in love to plan a fresh life with the beloved in some far romantic place where the air is salubrious and the flora and fauna sub-tropical . I was surprised this time that he should have chosen his new home as near as Sicily , but the col- lection of illustrated literature left no doubt ; and the atlas was lying open at Italy ; and on the desk was a volume of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , HYDRJERE . Hackneyed though it may be and sadly lacking in initiative , he and **30;473;TOOLONG were going to elope to Sicily . It took me the best part of an hour to persuade Angela to surrender her will to mine and write a letter at my dictation . " There 's only one way to succeed with Con : to call his bluff . He wants to leave you and take Halcyone to Sicily because he knows he must n't . Now do be a good obedient child and write what I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folders ; that 's the last stage but one . " And then I added , cruel to be kind : " Aquamarines do n't suit dark people , but perhaps she has blue eyes . . . . " That settled it . it was quite a good letter , though I kept as nearly as possible to what I imagined to be Angela 's style or lack of it , in her confession of guilty love . She would not name the man , but she had come to the limit of endurance . She had to be free , yes , free , free , free . She had to find out what a great passion might really mean . She then described in some detail , with much geographical precision , the exact spot where this glorious voluptuous month of sin was to be spent , leaving no possible room for doubt that it was Sicily . Her profusion of adjectives would have brought tears to the eyes of a stylist . She then thoughtfully mentioned the boat by which she proposed to travel and the date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parenthesis ) and repeated passionately the need of the soul and the body to be quit of the tether of responsibility " But , " Angela protested , utterly bewildered , " I 'm not . I mean I would n't . None of it 's true . It 's Con , not me . Oh , you 're much cleverer than I , but I do n't know what you 're doing , and I do n't un-derstand . " I soothed her as best I could and trusted that when the story had a happy ending she could cease to bother by what nonsense it was achieved . For there was no need that she should understand . Harriet would understand , and this letter was written for her , not for Con . I was trusting to the wits of my unknown collaborator . For believe me , Helen , he 's not your cup of tea . He was n't mine and he wo n't be yours . He 's a very nice gentleman ( as all my cooks used to say ) , but Phyllis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never you . I gave Angela her instructions , which by judicious reminder of the aquamarines , she promised to obey . They were quite simple : She was to leave this letter for Con and disappear , but turn up at Southampton in time to board the boat leaving for Naples where she had to change . " I do n't want to go to Naples and changer cried Angela , in a pathetic wail . " You wo n't have to . Con will see to that . " But to myself I added with a slight qualm : " At least , I hope to God he will . " For if I had been a little too confident it might end in poor Angela having to take a sea trip to Sicily whether she wanted to or not . Shortly after this a sister of mine living in Scotland got ill and sent for me . My letters were forwarded but among them was not a line from Angela Dilys . Either she was singularly ungrateful or in Sicily . I hoped it was the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ex-husband , to Hilda , and to the current Mrs. Barnaby . Of the three , Hebe interested me the most , though I had never met her and did not even know her name . When I returned to London , passing the Queen 's Hall , which I did twenty times a day as 1 lived in Park Crescent , I noticed they were billing a violin recital by Hero Latimer . I knew the name quite well of course , although I had never actually heard her play . But it suddenly struck me , as though someone had just touched me on the shoulder and pointed it out , that the initials of Hero Latimer were " H " and " L " . There were a thousand other " H.L. 's " but nevertheless I could not shake off that curious certainty that here was Con 's fourth Great Love . Here was Hester , Hebe , Helen , Hilda , Harriet . Odd that I should never have thought of Hero . .. . I had acted in " Much Ado about Nothing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front row of the circle . She played well , but I am not musical ; the human element is what fascinates me . Yes , this was the girl . She was strangely like myself , ten years ago . Con had fallen in love with me and out of love with Phyllis ; on that pendulum-swing of attraction and counter-attraction he may easily have fallen in love with Hero and out of love with Angela . Still here she was , playing at the Qu.2en 's Hall six weeks after the date of that elopement to Sicily , for ever and ever , so it looked as though all had gone well from Angela 's point of view . In the interval I sent round my card ( " Jean Barnaby " ) and scribbled a request that she should see me . Luckily no one was in the artists ' room except Hero . She was white and exhausted , but I liked the mocking smile with which she received me : " You 're Con 's first wife ? He often spoke of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I corrected " first " to " second . " " Phyllis was his first , and Angela his third . Is he with Angela now ? " The mocking smile widened till it was almost a schoolgirl grin : " How should I know , Mrs. Barnaby ? " " You do know . " " Yes , he is . Did you have anything to do with that letter ? I suspected a guiding hand behind the child-wife . " " I dictated it . " " You devil ! " But she was laughing , and I exclaimed with relief : " Then you 've got over it ? " " Right over it , thanks . He was terribly attractive ? " " Was n't he ? Is n't he ? " " But he was such a chump over that letter . He did n't see that the romantic description of Sicily , Greek temples and wine-dark sea and the fields of Persephone and all the rest of it , he did n't see that that was just a burlesque of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extraordinary coincidence that Angela proposed to do the same all-forlove act at the same time and chose the same place to do it in . " " You saw though ? " " Did you mean me to ? If you were once married to Con , you must have realized he was ? " " Not very subtle ? He has no more subtlety than a duck-billed platypus . Do you live in Regent 's Park , by the way ? Yes , I thought so . That letter was written for you . As a warning . " " For me ? But you did n't know me . " I explained about the rhythm of his infidelities . Hero Latimer said : " I guessed of course that there had been a brain in this . But what a brain ! I 'm feeling rather respectful . " " Respectful ? You ought to be feeling guilty  --  ashamed  --  broken-heartedremorseful  --  resentful  --  anything but re-spectful . " " I adore brains , " repeated Hero . " It 's so exciting ; you can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at yours , for instance , stretching right out through Angela and through Con till they touched me . Is n't that enough to make you tingle ? " " Tell me what happened over the letter ? " " I thought I 'd told you . I tried to convince Con that her going to Sicily was a brilliant fake , but he would n't believe me . He insisted on taking it literally and he was furious  --  a virtuous outraged husband . It was really rather comical because he had completely forgotten there was any reason why he should n't be outraged or virtuous . We argued about it until we hated each other , and that was the end of that . He went storming off , looking , I must say , impossibly handsome , to rescue Angela from a danger that did n't exist . And I slipped sadly away home to get over my illusions , take myself in hand and practice for my con-cert . " " You succeeded brilliantly in the last item . What about the other two ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was one of these infatuations , you know . " " I know . But we should n't marry them . Not unless we 're Phyllis or Angela . Did he give you a necklace of aquamarines , by any chance ? " " You 're a wizard . They 're quite nice , but they do n't suit me . " " Then give them back to me . You see , they 're the property of the current Mrs. Barnaby . " Angela was delighted to get her aquamarines but not so delighted to see me . I was , after all , the sort of woman who rummaged in other people 's desks and interfered between husband and wife . And I had made her tell lies to her darling Con . No , I was not a nice woman ; darling Con was well out of his first  --  no , his second  --  marriage . I did not ask her whether , once she had him safely back , she had blamed the whole of that disgraceful letter on to me , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still puzzling her , and just before I Left , she came out with it : " Mrs. Barnaby ? " " Yes ? " I made my " yes " sound cheerful and encouraging because I was curious to hear what , so to speak , was biting her . " You said  --  I mean  --  you seemed quite sure that you could show me the best way to behave over Con and that girl .. . though of course this time it was just a silly little infatuation and would have come right anyhow . But when he was married to you and fell in love with me . . . as you knew the way to get him back ? " " ? I could have got him back then . " " But you did n't . " " No , I did n't . " " But you must have known what to do , " persisted Angela , a little unwisely , " because you told me what to do . " " Yes , I did . " She looked deeply thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as I wanted her and Con to live happy ever after , I took my leave quickly and did not visit the Barnabys again .
