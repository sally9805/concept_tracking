THE mental anguish sal thi-np ? first moments of adjustment a11 ' 4 far suss searing than the physical . It was on Dolly l'auby 's : swoop , not his own ; before the ship had left the ice at the Buckley moorage , he had eoutited his meager stack , chip by ehip , as a good gambler should . One of the blues at the bottom had represented his life ; he had known it , and had pushed the stack in . That Dolly was here , facing the same showdown , was something else again . She had not dune it deliberately , but blindly , like a child stepping down from the curb into roaring trallie . The truth of it was that she was here solely because of her tannin &nee; in him , in his ability as a flier , in his ability to master any crisis .

She hadthought her unfitness and futility to be already proved in his eyes  --  a point of view he was sure he could have laughed aside , or soothed , came the stress of immediate events was over . She bad eon-ceded her sup posed lack of caliber  --  a gesture , of itself , that revealed the steel of your-age . She had gone to sleep on that note , humble , self-abased . And now , this side of death , new deeps awaited her , pitfalls of helplessness and futility from which he was powerless to defend her .

It was the answer to this latter question that hrcnigh1 sleep at last . As always , mental peeve carne not from contemplation of the ruins of the past , het from an appraisal of how best to meet the future . The thing to du , with respect to Dully , was to postpone her awareness as long as possible . Make her think it was only a temporary dilemma , that the ships must soon be back , that it was an adventure , grim at the moment , that they would one day look hack upon . laughing . Meanwhile , conserve the food and wait For the breaks , Ile slept uutii noon , a matter of two hours or more . llis leg wakened him , the pain of it piercing through the heavy , luxurious lethargy that enveloped him .

He disposed himself as comfortably as possible and closed his eyes , sure that lie could not sleeli again , thinking only to rest until Dolly should waken . When he roused the second time , it was after five . He inched to the opening , moving cautiously KO that he would not disturb Dolly , and twisted back to study the northern sky . It was clear and flawless , as yet . The wind held to the same note , whining in the crags overhead . Yet storms , at this season , could blow from the north in ; smatter of minutes ; a blizzard could be raging , full-grown , within an hour after the first misty banners had begun to waver from the iron peaks . They had shelter of sorts . Heat was their next essential ; a wood reserve , plenty of it . Ile crept bask and laboriously began to put on his harness .

Ile had just brought . up a load of wood , laborious step by step , when Dolly appeared at the opening , yawning . Rest had done wonders for her ; rest and the marvelous elasticity of youth . As she tossed back her hair and ridslied her eyes , smiling up at him , she looked more than ever like a tousled , healthy child . I ler sweater was open , as was the flannel shirt beneath . The top of a silk slip was visible , with a strap broken . " Button up , " he told her with pretended severity . " Never waste heat , not any . Always get your ski togs on , the minute you crawl out . " Clutching her sweater dose , she backed into the cave , smiling . " You know , this all seems unconventional , sort of . Did I snore ? " " Not a bit , " he assured her , delighted at her cheerfulness . Rest had done much for her spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fine , except I was sure some joker had put rocks in any bed .

They 'll probably wait until tomorrow . They 've had a hard night of it , tun , remember . " He crept in slowly , easing his armored leg wit . the opening . This was the most painful posture of all . He said , breathing heavily : " Have you  --  rung for service yet ? Use the phone by your bed . Tell ' ern , dinner for two . " " I have to have my bawth first . And get my war paint on . " She looked at him accusingly , wriggling into the arms of her ski outfit . " What d'ye mean , prowling around like this ? Did n't I tell you I 'd do the heavy work ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood supply , for instance . " At last he was turned around , resting on his side . He began to take off his harness . " Yeah , I 'm through , " he admitted . " I guess I 'll let you do the heavy work , at that . " " Fine . Now you 're showing a gleans or human intelligence . " She sat still for a moment , cross-legged , watching him . He had the harness all ; he straightened the leg gently . He looked at her then , and caught an expression in her eyes that he could not fathom . She flushed a little ; momentarily she was grave , aloof . " I did n't show much intelligence before we slept , " she said . " Sorry . I wo n't blow up like that again . " " ' S all right . I love you for it , Dolly . " He could feel himself flushing too . " I mean that . You were wrong in what you said , of course . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Never mind , " she cut in quickly . " The episode 's over . Please , Court . It was I who opened the subject . Is n't it my privilege to close it ? " She smiled , and the constraint between them vanished as quickly as it had come . Yet she was still remote . He knew , and it hurt him , that her manner now would have been the same toward the Beakies and Freddies of her own circle , toward any of the sugar boys . She had withdrawn in spirit to that careless , superficial circle , and had shut him out . " And now , " she said , " what would you like ? A porterhouse ? A little hot consomm45 first ? " " My wants are few . Just bacon and flapjacks . " He felt lonely and depressed , in spite of himself , It appeared that she must work out her own salvation without his help . And he too . . .

They would wait a long time . " At least , we 'll companionable , a lark of proportions . It appeared that she assumed , beyond doubt , that the claim was lost , that the whole affair was washed up . He must have accepted that fact , too , her manner implied . Twilight was deepening . He told her that she should cross the lake before it was dark and look in the ashes of the ship for the head of a camp ax that had been in the equipment . He would whittle out a new handle for it ; they would need it to split kindling and things . It would be a long night , and cold . They might as well be comfortable . A fire was cheerful . " And while you 're over there , Dolly , look at those wing tanks . If they 're not melted down too much , we can use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a reflector out of them for the fire . You know , throw the heat in here , where we can use it . Oh , yes , and look for the oil bucket . It must be there somewhere . This skillet does n't give us much of a reserve water supply . " She accused him of just trying to keep her busy , her mind occupied ; but she went , nevertheless , and no more protection than a peashooter . But there was , in truth , no danger from the wolves . Not yet . While she was gone , he studied their resources with relation to a long haul . There was wood in plenty close at hand ; his survey had proved that . Water was thirty feet distant , down the slope . A hole could be chopped in the ice and a trail kept open to it even if new snowfall came , which was likely . Their cave was substantial enough . the ledge ample protection , to withstand any storm . They had plenty of blankets ; their clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking , but that one was as inexorable in its demands as the march of time and tide ; food . If he were upright , on good legs , with a plentiful supply of ammunition , he might have made shift to support them off the land , thin and scattered as wild life was , hidden from the wolves and the cold . There might have been an outside chance . But he was down , crippled . They might have need save them for our next big moment . Meanwhile , break out that package of makings . I 'll roll one while the cook swings into action . " He ate little , pleading no interest in food because of his leg , though he was ravenously hungry . He could n't warn her , yet , to go slow . Moreover , watching her eat with such hearty appetite , he did n't have the heart to cheek her . She would feel the pinch soon enough . They smoked makings cigarettes after the meal was done . Dolly heated water in the skillet and washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the business of tidying up . " Should n't we complain to the management , Court ? The maid service is n't so good . " It was all very jolly and cheerfully too . In the matter of cheerfulness she appeared to lean over backward ; a rebound from her previous self-abasement , no doubt . But a short distance from out on the ice , she hesitated and looked back . " You 're sure the wolves wo n't get inc ? ' " Not a chance , " he assured her . " There are n't any , at the moment . Besides , they 're not starving yet ; they wo n't be for another month . Even a Siberian has got to be plenty hungry before he 'll attack a human being . So run along . I 'll be watching with the rifle .

She had also found the head of a small shovel in the ruins , a part of his field equipment , and had brought it along . " I knew you 'd have me shoveling snow on some pretext or other .

The stove smoked at first , until he learned the right angle at which their crude chimney should he tilted , so that the wind caused a roaring updraft . Then all was line . The reflector threw the heat in ; the wall and ceiling became saturated and threw it back ; it was comfortably , livably warm . There was no dampness inside , since he had insisted that each particle of snow be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp ; wall and ceiling were bone dry . They talked long into the night , propped on elbows in their cubicles , facing toward the fire . No constraint , on tho surface , was between them now ; the ancient magic of an open , crackling fire , their sense of nearness , of companionship , of dependence upon each other in a measureless void , made for frank and easy speech , for confidence stripped of superficialities and inhibitions . They discussed their childhood , revealing hidden chapters . Her mother , who had married late in life , had died at childbirth ; his when he was ten years old . He had literally been on his own , except for long intervals when his father had emerged from the North , sometimes with dust , more often without . Twice , two separate summers , his father had allowed him to go along on excursions into the wilds ; those summers had been pinnacles of experience , the ecstasy of living . He had absorbed his father 's creeds and codes ; one , above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed Swiftwater Stewart 's death . A gambler 's creed . " At least once in every man 's life , 1 he cards fall right . But when the break comes  --  and this part of it is n't luck  --  be ready for it . " " He got his break , " Court yawned . " Yeah , and he was ready . But the cards were stacked . Buckley outheld him . I thought I was ready too . , I 'd spent ten years ? " " And somebody fouled your hand ? When you counted your cards , you had one too many ? " " A queen  --  wild . My fault though . In a steep game , you 're presumed to know the rules . And on the other hand , I may use her yet .

As soon as this reargan izatton 's over , we 'll settle down and get acquainted . ' Poor dad . There was always a reorganization . He was going to build a house for me , at Cleveland . He 'd dreamed dreams for me , just like your father did for you , no doubt . Now they 're both gone . " They could oven discuss the events of the night before , in their lazy , lethargic mood ; it seemed not to reopen old wounds . For the first time he learned the exact means , the time interval , whereby she had been able to stow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ravenhill had dragged Griggs into the alcove between the two boathouses . They had thought she had gone back to the cabin ; she had made a pretense of it . But in those moments that the ship was hidden from them she had hurried back and climbed aboard , There was one phase of her emotional outburst , after she had returned from the glacier  --  she referred to this , yawning , as her " purge " ? that out him deep . She had bean afraid of wolves . She had seen them on the ice , in the moonlight , less than two hours before . The picture of that first wolf , hackles erect , his head low and turned back toward the cave , had still been before her . That was why she had hesitated when he had asked her to go up to the glacier alone . He had said , impatiently : " Of course , alone . Would you prefer not ? " And so , do or die , she had gone . It was funny now , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back from the glacier . And when she had come back , having done her best , he had doubted her . In the telling of it she mimicked an inflection that had been foreign to his feelings at the moment  --  sardonic , disbelieving : " No rock ? So you could n't find it , eh ? " Court was aghast . " I did n't mean it that way at all . I was just giving you time to get hold of yourself , to tell your story . And I 'd forgotten all about the wolves . Itdidn'teven occur to me ? " " It 's all right . " He could hear her . - awn . " Never mind . It was probably good for me . Anyway , it put me in the right mood to do a **29;1402;TOOLONG act that must have been a honey , no less . When the cue calls for it , do I emote ! Or do n't I ? " " Please be serious for a minute . Do n't you see that because you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fear ? " " Tut , tut , " she warned . " Tut ! I did n't mean to discuss that part of it . And I wo n't . Neither will you . I mean it. , Court . The answer is no . You would n't take advantage of a lady just because she ca n't run away . Or would you ? Maybe I should have slept next to the door . " Her mood was as impervious as armor . More than the tarpaulin wall was between them . He leaned forward , with a muttered imprecation at the painful effort of it , and tossed another stick on the fire from the pile at his elbow . The sparks showered upward . There was a great upheaval in the adjacent blankets . " Was that just an excuse to peek ? Warn me next time . " He settled back , arms locked under his head , and stared up at the flickering , frescoed basalt . His leg was itching again . It seemed that it always ached when his blood was roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Cozy , sort of . " " And I 'm sleepy , " she returned , her voice muffled . " I 'll bet I sleep for a week after I get back to the cabin . And wo n't I have stories to tell ! The gang 'll be popeyed . I wo n't be able to talk of anything else for months . Like that horse that galloped backwards , you know . Ever hear that wheeze ? You 're supposed to ask : Why did the horse gallop backwards ? " " Why did the horse gallop back-wards ? " " Because he did n't care where he 's going  --  he just wanted to see where he 'd been . Laugh , darn you . " " Her ! " he said , obediently , " Har ! " A long time afterward  --  he did n't know how long , except that the cave was utterly dark and cold and the last embers had long since died  --  the deep-toned , muffled booming re-echoed again from the heart of one of the glaciers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions of immeasurable forces straining and shifting in its groove ; it was doubly so now . He was glad that Dolly had not heard it ; she must certainly have been asleep . Then the tarpaulin quivered at his elbow . Her hand was groping under it , seeking his , seeking reassurance . He grasped it , and her fingers clung tightly . " Court . " Her whisper was shy , hesitant . " If something happened to one of us all of a sudden , it would be pretty hard on the one that was left , would n't it ? " " Sure would . Yes . But nothing 'll happen . When we leave , it 'll be together  --  I hope . " " Meanwhile , we must n't pretend any more , must we ? With each other , I mean . I ca n't help being here with you , nor you with me . So we 'll just take each other as we are , and things as they are , and make the best of them , wo n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure , " he agreed gently . " Of course . " It was impossible to hold animosity toward her at such a moment . He felt a little ashamed . Instead of sustaining her , she was sustaining him , rebuking him , pointing the way . On the instant , he knew that he should tell her the brutal facts . To carry on the present farce was an insult to her intelligence , her courage . It could only lead , when realization came , to her further humiliation . But before he could frame the words , she beat him to the punch . She whispered : " One question then ? Will you answer it without pretending ? " " Sure I will . And do n't whisper . Speak right up . " He chuckled . " Nobody 's listening . " But she did not speak up ; her voice was low : " This is it . You will eat a good meal in the morning , wo n't you ? Plenty of flapjacks and bacon ? All you want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What do you mean , Dolly ? " " I mean , the ships wo n't be back . You know it . I know it . " " How did you know it ? " " I figured it out . " . " When ? " " As soon as you did  --  almost . When you shouted at me like that , when you told me to get out , quick , and wave the blanket , I knew something terrible was wrong . Then the ships kept going  --  straight south , not toward the Liard . Besides , why should they come back ? Then , when I came inside , I saw your face . You were feeling terrible  --  on my account , as usual . You did n't get mad when I asked you if I 'd bungled again . You did n't curse me or anything . That would have been fine . You said : ' It does n't matter , child . Oo to sleep . They 'll be hack tomorrow . ' . . . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d-durnb ? " " You 've got me there , " he confessed . " I 'm learning fast . " " So am I , " she said . " About both of us . I thought I 'd just let you go on pretending for a few days . But I could n't . It was too mean . I ca n't see you suffer or go hungry . Not while I 'm strong and well-fed . If we have to save food , let 's save it together . Court , don't. you see that I 'm not afraid to din ? Not with you . I 'd like to prove it . I 'd like to help you , make it a little easier for you . If I can . If you 'll let me . There 's only one thing . You 'll have to promise me this : If I fail , do n't be sorry for Inc . Most of all , when you feel the sorriest for me , do n't talk about love , how you 've always loved me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that rot . " He lay quiet for a space , silent . " Okay , Dolly . But what about between times , when I do n't feel cony for you ? For instance , now . We 're well-fed at the moment . It 's only tomorrow that we die . " " No . " She withdrew her hand . " Sorry I was so frightened a moment ( Continued on Page 48 ) ( Continued /porn Pas . 47 ) ago . I did n't mean to be penny ante and personal . " " There you go , " he accused . " If we 're going to joke abmit dying  --  which is always easy , lady , when it 's a long way off ? ca n't we joke about love- too ? " " Certainly we ran . Of course . And laugh . " Her voice was muffled " But let 's do it tomorrow . Just before we die . Meanwhile  --  good night . " " Good night , " he said , gently . " Good night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dur- ing the night . He heard it , sleeping fitfully . The whine of it rose to a higher pitch for a space , then died away . Later , it blew , a rushing , roaring down from the glaciers that was like a sweeping tide . The east tarp held firm , but the chimney went down . Driving snow instantly sprayed through the opening , rousing them up . Under his direction , his flashlight trained on the hole , she plugged the break in their defenses with the empty turkey , stuffing it in securely . Another unforgettable picture was there , as he flicked the light on and off , conserving the precious life of the tiny batteries  --  Dolly Imeeling beneath the break , one hand clutching her blanket about her , her bare right arm raised upward toward the ceiling and the thundering sky . It was unconscious pathos , unconscious beauty . The blanket slipped from her shoulders as she was forced to use both hands at the task ; he snapped off the light instantly , and both laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a goldfish feels like . Is your old chimney going to fall down every time the wind blows harder than usual ? " " We 'll anchor it in the morning , " he assured her . " We 'll use those straps with the snaps on ' em , and tie it so dynamite could n't blast it loose . Got ' er wrangled , as the cowboys say ? " " She 's wrangled . And I 'm all goose flesh . Br-r ! Where are my good old flannels ? " Later , as they listened - to the drums and trumpets of the storm  --  and the whole orchestration was there , rolling in the night , from the reeds and flutes to the pipe organ 's mighty diapason  --  she said , laughing : " If this be treason , make the most of it . It is cozy here . " " Right . It 'll be cozier in the morning , though , when we get more wood . We may have to dig for it . " " But we 'll get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the matter with you . And me . With most of the world . We take everything too seriously . Life . Death ? " " Love ? " " Yes . . . . No  --  who said that ? Silence , please ; I 'm in the grip of a philosophical mood . Do n't let any trivialities intrude . Who was it said that to die must be an awfully great adventure ? Kuhlai Khan ? No , Peter Pan . " " Did n't Shakespeare have some observations on that subject ? Ho thought of plenty of apt things , things that apply to us here . For instance , about two weeks from now : ' fond Cassius bath a lean and hungry look ? ' What 's the rest of it ? " " ' Such men are dangerous . " ' She chuckled . " Do n't he morose . Or shall I cook up some good old flapjacks for you now ? " " I can wait till morning . Meanwhile , feed me some more beautiful thoughts . I dote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coating . What's. your philosophical conclusion , if any. ? " " It is n't any heavyweight . Just this : Things always look big a long ways off . Worry about this , fear about that , resentment about something else . But they 're smaller when you come up to them . Some things look.terrihle in the distance . There 's always beauty there , when you 're close . " " Marvelous , " he teased . " How come a pearl like that escaped all the heavy thinkers through the ages ? The only thing is , you have n't said anything . Be specific . " " Must I ? A hunch of us went over to Death Valley once . There was heat and dust . Flies bit us . The glare on the desert hurt our eyes .

You were miles away and a thousand feet above it . It was because they did n't live to see the sunset . Their faces were in the sand . Hot sand . Better than one hundred and thirty degrees in the shade . And no shade . " She sighed . " If I did n't know that you were just trying to badger me , I 'd get mad and say biting things . Then we 'd both be soured and savage . Let 's be more specific then . Take your claim , for instance . You spent ten years getting ready to find it .

" " I do n't mean that , though some of the sugar boys , as you call them , wo n't forget it . . . ? I mean my pride . I 've crawled and crept and groveled since I started to tag along .

And what is it , now that you 've come to the end of the trail , now that this wonderful prize is here , right in your grasp , just like you 'd dreamed ? Just yellow rock , Court . Two weeks from now , will all the gold that 's supposed to be in the claim  --  tons and tons of it  --  buy just one big , hot , juicy Hamburger ? " When he did not immediately reply , and the roll and thunder of the storm reverberated in the cave , and the straining tarp creaked under the buffeting impact of it , she became alarmed . " Well ? We can joke about the claim , too , ca n't we ? Or can we ? " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay you back , will you answer one hypothetical question ?

" " It could be both , " he reminded . " But it wo n't commit you to anything . It begins with an ' if . ' " " Well , you can try it . I guarantee nothing . " " Okay . If , at the Embassy Ball , instead of starting a feud that seems likely to persist to the grave , I 'd asked you to marry me , what Would your answer have been ? " " That 's easy . No . " " Why ?

It was Dolly who called the turn , who motioned to invisible wings to ring the curtain down . She said , in her most matter-of-fact , careless way : " Okay , gambler . Remember , you asked for it .

Good night , Court , " xx T HE storm lasted five days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snowfall , but the force of the wind was so sustained , its cold so bitter and the wind-driven , sleetlike pellets so torturing to face that it was impossible to stir abroad for more than minutes at a time . Even so , they foraged out each day for wood , creeping along in the lee of the cliff where the sweep of the wind left a species of alley between wall and mountainous drifts . Court insisted on helping in this necessary work , in spite of his previously announced determination to lie low and give his leg a chance to knit . It was painful to get under way , though not so excruciatingly so as at first ; bat inactivity was more irksome . It warmed their blood , these necessary excursions ; it made the warmth and security , of the cave a castle by comparison . Under his direction she got the chimney moored firmly fore and aft along the face of the ledge . Because this side of their shelter was exposed fully to the wind , no drifts formed there , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The harder the wind blew , the more cheerfully the fire roared . There was plenty of wood near at hand and requiring only the labor of prying and hacking it from the frozen drift , though their food supply dwindled swiftly . With food they had chosen a middle ground between prodigality and a miserly hoarding of their forlorn reserves . Computing it on a basis of their average daily ration , it appeared that they were safe for eight days . Perhaps nine . Days of grace , they called them , laughing . They joked constantly about the food , the monotony of their fare . They laughed about his boot , the boot for his right foot , that he was unable to wear . They called the boot an orphan ; they stood it in the corner and referred to it as their reserve supply .

He did much whittling during that five-day interval . ' A pair of crutches , handholds and all , the jointed and splinted portions held rigidly together with strips cut from waterproof coral tainers . And a figure-four trap . TheM were a few snowshoe rabbits lurking along the fringes of the lake ; there must be . Perhaps some ptarmigan , or " fool hen . " If so , they might snare one . He explained how the trap was supposed to work . To attract rabbit or fool hen , they " might have to try out a pinch or two of their precious flour as bait ; itself a gamble of proportions . " I 'm not sure they 'll touch it , " Court told her : " A rabbit 's no intel- ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be living here . Subnormal as he is , though , he 's liable to figure there 's something haywire about . ' it , ' Yeah , ' he 'll say , wrinkling his nose . ' It looks good . It smells good .

" Suppose he eats it and ? runs before the box falls on him ? It is n't up to us to feed the rabbits . We 'd be as bad as that bride that went down to the store to find out what to do about rats . Ever hear that one ? " " Never , " he swore . " Do tell me . " " She was a newly-wed , you understand , and her love nest was overrun with rats . So she asked the storekeeper what to do about it . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rat biscuit ! ' she said . ' Buy special biscuit for those nasty things ? They 'll eat what we eat or go without . ' " Court laughed dutifully ; The storm spent itself the fifth night , though the sky was still leaden when daylight strengthened , and swirling snow hid the farther walls . The wind blew on ; the temperature fell rapidly . It was useless even to attempt to set the figure-four trap . The rabbit trails that had threaded the protected north wall of the lake , west of their shelter , were all snowed under . Ptarmigan , it any , had blown downwind . He gave Dolly no hint of what the blizzard had done to their frail hopes with respect to fresh meat , nor what the five-day fast would mean to the wolf packs in the higher barrens . Because the snow was impassable in any direction except in the protected lee of the wall westward , and then only for a short distance , he told her cheerfully that the next chore was to make her a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterproof material twisted hard as rawhide for the web . A makeshift , but it would work . Then she could explore the west end of the lake for rabbit trails . He finished the snowshoes the second night following the storm and she tried them out immediately , full of hope , following along the great trough for a space , then swinging southwest across the drifts . She came back weary , snow-whitened and chilled to the bone . She was so clumsy ; she kept falling down ; the snowshoes constantly interfered ( Continued an Par ? $2 ) 52 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST Febrasnry 5.1958 TABLETS FOR swa - plays offering Laymen 's Pure Aspirin in handy moat beaus ? in both ' Se and we film They saw only the tracks of the wolves at first , trails that crept up by night , silently , almost to the door of their shelter . But just before dusk on the seventh day following the storm , the fifth of the starvation stretch , the Siberians came boldly into the open . Looking out from their shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , crossing and recrossing the great trough , emerging from between the drifts like whitened fragments of the gray night , sliding from view as silently as they had come . More than twenty , there were ; perhaps close to forty ; they were never fully in view all at once . Always their heads pointed upwind , toward the gap ; and always , reappearing , they had crept closer . They were spare of frame at this season , all muscle and hone . A full-grown Siberian , weighing close to two hundred pounds , would eat one fifth his bulk at a meal during the fat months when they were following the caribou herds ; but nature had also given him the iron endurance to withstand hunger far beyond the limits of other carnivorous animals . The hunger would be there , raging like fire in his vitals , making of him the epitome of all that is savage and devouring , but the patience of the wild sustained him . As night closed down , they were close at hand . They could hear them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their snuffling and deep-throated muttering , the characteristic champing of their mighty jaws . " Family talk , " Court explained carelessly . " The young ones are saying : ' What are we stalling for ? Let 's see some action . ' And the old boys are coming back at them : ' Wait , you nitwits . They 're men , and man meat always comes dear . ' Yeah , we 'll give ' em a little hot lead in the morning . Send ' em on their way . " His hand was forced before morning ; they were snuffling at the door . He drew up the rifle softly , and the flashlight . With the rifle barrel he lifted the corner of the tarp from its peg , pushed it down with a sudden motion and turned the glare of the flashlight into the night . Court knew they must have their lesson now , at the cost of a precious shell ; he aimed as best he could , full on the , chest of a great , silvery leader . The instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flick of a whip ; the wounded animal threshed in the snow , rolled back down the path . " Quick ! " Dolly whispered . She was at Court 's shoulder , swathed in her blankets . " Let 's get him . " " No use , " Court returned , with a grim understanding smile at the long gap her hunger had bridged . " He 's food ; yes , enough food for a month . But grinning lads as hungry as us have beaten us to it . Listen . " A bestial clamor had risen below . They saw no detail in the gloom . The wounded animal made no outcry , according to his nature ; it . was his devouring fellows whose snapping and snarling filled the night . It ceased , presently . They could hear a few disappointed ones ranging hopefully along the back trail , snuffling and champing in the crimson snow . From scattered points in the darkness came the sharp cracking of bones . " Get back to bed , Dolly . Do n't worry . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not add that they would be back again , probably in two or three days , their sagacious memories dimmed by mounting fires . Long afterward , Dolly said : " You can scare them away that easily , whenever they come ? " " Sure . They do n't like guns . Or fire . " What chain of thought inspired her next question , minutes later , ho could not fathom . The reaction from the previous moments , probably ; a growing confidence in their immediate security . " You 're getting along fine on your crutches , are n't you , Court ? The bone 's healing ? " " Sure . Those crutches were a lifesaver . I 'll get along . " For the first time , the morning of the sixth day of the starvation stretch , there was no wind ; the lack of it was like a benediction . Yet behind that calm , as always , was a sense of trigger alertness , of giant forces Bunning themselves in the iron peaks like sleepy cougars , their lazy , slitted eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , around by the time the faint bar of light above the southern tarp had strengthened to brilliant silver . She crawled past him on the way out , pausing to rumple his already tousled hair . " Awake , sleeper , " she whispered . Even in his lethargy he could sense the vibrant . life that seemed to thrill in her finger tips ; it was as though her hope , unquenchable again , had risen up anew on the heels of the terrific night , " Awake , thou sluggard . Lo , the dawn . " He could hear her in the distance , breaking out the wood from the frozen drift . She was singing , and in good voice , the natural , eloquent quality of it enhanced by the well of silence through which it rang . She would pause at the end of each measure , and softly across the half-ndle expanse of the lake the silvery echo would float back , each word and lilting cadence perfectly reproduced : " When the swaying  --  blades of corn -- Whisper soft  --  al breaking morn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FULL Sla FULL sTRFNGTII Laymen 's Pure Aspirin is used and endorsed by million . of Peo- plc .

He was dressed when she came back , and was sitting , chin in hands . She tossed the wood down and stooped to peer in . Her cheeks were rosy with the cold ; her eyes danced . " Come out of it , " she commanded , pointing dramatically . " Look . " " What ails you ? You asking me to sing , ' Hark , hark ! the lark ? ' ? " " Come on , " she urged . He crawled toward her , dragging his crutches . She helped him up . " Look . Did n't I tell you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , real close ? " The cliffs were marble walls , streaked with grays and blacks . The lake , too , was whitened , except for the great wind-swept trough . Overhead the sky arched , incredibly blue , hard and polished as steel . Whites , blues , the gray and black of rampart and ice . There was another color there , spread thinly across the tremendous canvas . One of the rare phenomena of the winter North , seen only when all light conditions are perfect , on the heels of a storm . The south face of each peak overhead , the crests of the marble walls , even the crests of the drifts on the floor of the lake  --  all were rosily high-lighted , not brilliantly but softly , and the shadows themselves were washed with crimson . It was an unreal effect , startling , yet indescribably lovely . " Well ? " Dolly demanded . " Is it proved ? " " You 're right , " he agreed , leaning heavily on his crutches . " And to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face south . Just once . Just for a. minute . " " Wiry ? " She clutched the parka closer and shrank away . She laughed . " Fool ! Not in this light . " " That 's what I want  --  in this light . It wo n't last long . I want to see it in your hair . And on your face . " But she turned away , bent down , and scuttled into the cave . When he crawled in , she was cross-legged in front of the fire , writing in his notebook . " I 'm borrowing a page , " she told " D'ye mind ? I 'm going to write a diary . An ' X ' for each day that we eat . Zeros for the dare we do n't . Wo n't that be fun ? " " You 'll only need one page , " he grinned . " All zeros . On the other hand , we may catch a rabbit tomorrow . Today even . " She tore the page from the notebook , folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flannel shirt . She said , as she poured the tea : " Do n't spoof me , Court . There 's no rabbits . Not after the wolves . Wo n't they hide ? " " To be honest , yes . But . they 'll be out in the open in three or four days . " He looked at her keenly . " You 're not weakening , by any chance ? Where 's all this hope with which you greeted the flaming dawn ? " " I 'm full of hope . " Her gaze was level across her steaming cup . " I wo n't weaken again . " After breakfast , she begged him to let her take the rifle and make a circuit of the lake . Give her one shell ; only one . She was sure she could bag a fool 4 hen , if there were any . She did n't know about rifles , but she was a pretty good shot . In a shooting gallery , once , she had hit three of those little ducks in a row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relented . She probably would n't see a thing of flesh and blood on the jaunt . Meanwhile , it would keep her mind occupied . He showed her how to manipulate the rifle , and took out three shells , leaving one in the barrel . " Down anything that moves , " he encouraged her . " If it moves , it 's meat . But do n't shoot till you see the whites of their eyes . Do n't stay too long . " He was sitting in his place , just inside the door , his crippled leg extended . She was kneeling beside him , her back to the door . She took the rifle in her right hand and sat back on her heels , preparing to rise up . But . first she slid her left arm about his shoulders . When he looked up at her inquiringly , her face was close . " Do n't worry about me , Court . I 'll be all right . " The hood of her parka brushed his hair ; her lips pressed against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that dutif ul and sweet ? So long , gambler . " She turned away quickly and crawled through the opening . " Wait , " he called after her . " Wait , Dolly . " By the time he made it to the opening , she was just turning the corner below , having run down the path they had beaten to the drift . She flung up her arm in a gay , jaunty gesture , her hood momentarily turned toward him . " Wait ! " He clutched the wall and raised himself up . He searched desperately for some expedient to halt her ; and found it . " Come back here , " he said in less strident tones . " I gave you the wrong shell . There was a defective one  --  I did n't like to tell you before  --  and darned if I did n't give it to you . Come and get a good one . " She leaned against the corner of rock , as though a part of her strength had gone from her . She peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Look at it , " he told her . " Take it out . See if there is n't a ' W ' stamped on the end of it , right beside the cap . " She ejected the shell with clumsy haste . It fell to the snow ; she stooped and retrieved it . " See ? " he said confidently . " That ' W ' means it 's a cull , worthless . It 's never supposed to leave the factory , but sometimes they get in the box , Come on . " He fumbled in his pocket . " l 'll give you a good one . " She came back toward him . Uncertainly . She stood just beyond arm 's length . " Throw it to me . " He shook his head , holding out his hand . " Come and get it . It might drop in the snow and get wet . That would rust the barrel . What ails you , child ? " Ile pretended to peer at her curiously . " D'ye think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand then , poised like some shy forest animal on the verge of flight . He extended his , and with a pretense of dropping the shell into her palm , clutched downward at her wrist . Quickly as he had done it , her reflex was quicker . Her wrist was only half in his grasp , and with a strength that astonished and staggered him , she wrenched herself away . The fury of the effort caused her to reel into the snow bank , to a half-sitting position . She leaped up instantly ; and Court , thrusting away from the walls with hands and his good leg , tackled her about the hips and brought her down . She struggled like a wildcat in his embrace , beat down on his head with her clenched fists . He only clung the tighter , brought her body closer and pinioned her arms . " Quiet , Dolly . " He repeated it over and over ; he could feel her heart beating like an imprisoned bird hurling itself again and again against unyielding bars . " Quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently , utterly limp , and he held fast to her , his eyes closed . It seemed , at first , that he had broken the fracture loose in his leg , but the pain eased little by little . He sat up , twisting his body in the narrow space between drift and wall , so that she was between him and the cave . She had dropped her shell in the struggle ; he had dropped his . He found them both , wiped them on his coat , and put them in his pocket . All the while she lay quiet , the hood of her parka turned away , her arms outspread . When he turned her head toward him , and pushed back the hood with hands that were gentle and trembling , her face was like marble , her long-lashed eyes closed . She had fainted . He disposed himself more comfortably , his back to the wall . He stood up the rifle beside him and inched closer to her . He unbuttoned the thrdat of her parka and slid his hand down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the note , brought it out and read it swiftly . He had been right . . . . He folded it and thrust it back , then leaned his head against the wall , his face upturned . " Damn your eyes , Stewart . " He was breathing deep and hard . " Damn your eyes . She 'd have done it too . " The note had read : Court , darting : I could n't do it while you were so helpless , but you do n't need me now .

P.S. : I didn'tanswer those hypothetical questions truthfully . The answer would have been yes . To all three of them . Is n't that dumb ? He saw her stir a little , as though slowly awakening , and her hand stole ( Continued on Pogo 55 ) ( Cenrinu  --  d from pat . 53 ) surreptitiously to her breast pocket . He turned his face fully away , then , pretending not to notice that she had revived , giving her time to collect herself . She turned presently on an elbow , sighed , and pushed herself up . She said , somewhat tremulously : " Well , Court ? " " You little fool , " he said not looking at her . " You brainless , precious little idiot . " He jerked his thumb toward the cave . " Get inside . Take off your parka . Take off your ski suit . Compose yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on out again . " " Yes , Court . " While she was gone , he writhed out of his fleece-lined coat and the leather jacket . beneath . He wrote briefly in his notebook , a note addressed to Skinner McGinn , tore out the page and placed it , together with a note that was already written and protected with waterproof paper , in an inside pocket of the coat . He worked fast , on account of his stiffening fingers . The temperature of the crystalline , static , beautiful air was deceptive . He folded coat and jacket into a comfortable seat at the base of the wall ; a seat big enough for two . He was sprawled comfortably there , his legs extended , his back against the wall , when she emerged from the cave and so stood erect , trim and boyish as ever in riding breeches and sweater . There was only one interval in mid-forenoon when the sunlight touched the amphitheater , pouring obliquely over a saddleback to the southeast . That moment was upon them now her shadow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimson . " Wait , Dolly . Stand there a second . Face south , toward the sun . Put your hands in your pockets . . . . Shoulders a little more square , please . Chin up . . . . That 's better . That 's fine . " And now she , too , was touched with light that gave her curly , storm-tossed hair new fire and life , that seemed to erase the wan lines from her face , that gave to her smooth cheeks , her brow and gently molded jaw the rosy hue of health and vitality . Rer eyes were serene and sparkling in that moment ; no line of her figure expressed futility or defeat . Her lips curved a little as she smiled  --  shyly , half embarrassed in that she knew his gaze was upon her . In this terrible light. ? Must you always have your way ? " When he did not reply , she turned her head to look at him , then ran to him with a little cry . " Court ! Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , almost harshly . " Ca n't I weaken once ?
