One night last week in Calders , Wis. , burglars set to work on the safe of Calders Elevator Co . When the safe 's protective mechanism released a flood of tear gas they had to leave . Not discouraged , they marched down the street , broke into a firehouse , stole two gas masks , returned to the safe , finished the job ( $400 cash , $2,800 nontransferable stock ) .
