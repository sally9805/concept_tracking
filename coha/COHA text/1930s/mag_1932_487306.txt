SERIOUS RESERVATIONS must be made to many of the views expressed in President Hoover 's special message on war debts . He hints , for example , that we can not revise these debts without " definite compensations . " What are these compensations to be ? Shall they be lower tariffs abroad on American goods ? And will this be any contribution to world stability so long as our tariff remains at its present extravagant levels , and is even jacked up from time to time , as it was on December 16 by President Hoover 's own order raising rates on eight items ? Yet when all reservations are made , the essence of the President 's message on war debts is statesmanlike , and one can only regret that Mr. Hoover had not the courage to take such a stand before we had driven seven nations to default . The heart of the President 's new proposal is in this paragraph : A year ago I requested that Congress should authorize creation of a debt commission to deal with situations which were bound to arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation as it has developed , it appears necessary for the Executive to proceed . Obviously , any conclusions would be subject to approval by the Congress . On the other hand , should the Congress prefer to authorize creation of a debt commission set up along the lines above indicated , it would meet my hearty approval . What President Hoover now says , in other words , is that he hopes for a revival by Congress of something like the World War Foreign Debt Commission , ' because the complex questions involved call for special knowledge and can not be adequately handled by ordinary diplomatic exchanges , but that if he does not get cooperation from Congress he will go ahead anyway . And his reason is the obvious one that we can not afford to wait until March 4 next to get such vital negotiations under way . Obviously , this program can not be successful without the immediate and whole-hearted cooperation , which Mr. Hoover invites , of the President-elect . Mr , Roosevelt 's duty is clear . No merely technical quibbles should any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what will undoubtedly be one of the most important questions with which he will be called upon to deal in his whole term . O WEN D. YOUNG 'S TESTIMONY in the ' mull case will profoundly shock his friends and admirers . It will be recalled that in January , 1929 , Mr. Insull let Mr. Young in for a good thing by permitting him to have a fourthousand-share interest in Insull Utility Investments at an insider 's price of $12 a share , while the public was allowed to purchase at $30 or above ; it went to $149 . Mr. Young testified that he thoroughly approved of the capital set-up of this company , which was the one that brought the whole Insull structure crashing to earth . Mr. Young was the ideal stockholder . He testified on December 16 that he " paid no attention to the investment and did not even read the annual reports " of the company , not because " I deal carelessly with investments , but because it would have made no difference with this particular investment . I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit or take a loss without incurring Mr. Insull 's displeasure . " He did not even dare to ask about the status of the company when Mr. Instill came to him and demanded , in December , 1930 , a $2,000,000 loan from the General Electric Company . He promptly got the money because , as Mr. Young put it , ' he was one of our best customers , " and despite the fact that all banks had refused him further loans . When Mr. Young was asked if he inquired what Mr. Insull was going to use the money for , he replied : " I , as Chairman of the Board of the General Electric Company , would not have asked Mr. Insull what he was going to do with the money . " So the General Electric went into the banking business and lent its stockholders ' $2,000 , - , 000 to an already bankrupt concern . Within two months Samuel Insull was back asking Mr. Young to help him stave off his bank creditors , which Mr. Young was able to do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the least damaging , of Mr. Young 's testimony , to which we shall refer at length in a later issue . T HE CONGRESS of the United States has at last voted the independence of the Philippines and thereby an act of justice has been in part achieved for which The Nation has never ceased to contend since the United States wantonly conquered the Islands in 1899 at a heavy cost of lives . For this we give thanks , even though the action has been marred by the strings tied to it  --  as is well set forth by Raymond Leslie Buell on another page . That the utterly selfish conditions attached to the bill jeopardize the existence of the future nation , and that we are launching it in the least generous and most hypocritical manner , is obvious . The news that the bill as it stands today has won the support neither of the Filipinos nor of the American residents in the Islands speaks for itself . Selfishness has , indeed , dictated the whole outcome with most of the members of Congress . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , that Philippine freedom was granted only because the free admission of Philippine products into the United States has unfavorably affected our own parasitic , government-maintained sugar industry . Well , we care less what the motive is than for the fact that Congress has voted independence at last . It may have to be done over ? Mr. Hoover may veto the bill , or its obvious deceit may compel its reconstruction  --  but if independence has once gone through , it can go through again . Meanwhile Manila threatens a boycott of all American goods to make its sense of outrage the clearer . T HE RAILROAD UNIONS are now admittedly fighting with their backs to the wall . The position their leaders have taken in the negotiations with the railway executives at Chicago shows that they are convinced that the basic wage rates must be permanently reduced . But they want to have as much bargaining power as possible before the question is placed in the hands of the government for adjustment in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act . Therefore the Brotherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of the railway companies to drop the " automatic restoration of wages " clause from the present temporary agreement . If the unions should permit this clause to be dropped , it would mean that the temporary 10 per cent cut in wages accepted a year ago actually constituted a permanent reduction in the basic rates . The workers might and probably would agree to such a reduction if it were ordered as a result of government arbitration . But to agree in advance of arbitration would obviously place them at a disadvantage in the subsequent negotiations . Fortunately , from the workers ' point of view , the Brotherhood officials went into the Chicago conference with their hands well tied by binding instructions from the members . This prevented them from being stampeded into accepting the railway companies ' proposals without adequate consideration for the views of the rank and file . Something of this sort happened in the negotiations that took place a year ago , with the result that the union officials found their leadership widely discredited among the workers . T HE MOST STRIKING FEATURE of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington was the brief account of the increase in the number of homeless young people  --  principally boys  --  who are wandering from town to town , sleeping in " jungles " and box-cars , " thumbing " their way along the highways , consorting with all the derelicts of the road , uncared for , untaught , underfed . Undoubtedly , this is one of the most alarming incidents of the depression , for its results will linger after the economic causes are removed . This involuntary army of young hobos are learning lessons that will never be wholly forgotten  --  irresponsibility and the technique of living by their wits on casual charity , arid the devastating sense of being unwanted , shuntedfrom town to town , without roots or any ordinary social values to support them . The physical hazards are equally great . The Children 's Bureau report says of conditions on the road : Last winter in one Western city thirty-five young men and boys were removed from box-cars , seriously ill , some in an advanced stage of pneumonia . As freight cars are policed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train is in motion . One railroad alone reported more than fifty young men and boys killed and more than a hundred tripped in this way last winter . Figures to show the number of boys on the road are hard to get . A figure of 200,000 for the whole country is offered in a recent survey published by the Emergency Unemployment Relief Committee in New York . The Southern Pacific reported 416,915 trespassers ejected from its property between September and May a year ago . Of this number it was estimated that from 20 to 25 per cent were under twenty-one years old . It is certain that conditions will force many thousands more to take to the road this winter . What will be their fate , and the fate of the society that is creating them ? The Children 's Bureau urges adequate local relief to prevent as many persons as possible from leaving their homes and towns ; and then a system , based on federal aid if necessary , of feeding , housing , registering , and training those who become transients despite local efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn of the " ' wild children " of Soviet Russia . Before the depression is many years older we may turn to Russia to learn how to deal with the problem of reclaiming our own homeless young people . T HE GREATEST ALARM is felt , if not openly expressed , in the Little Entente countries ? Jugoslavia , Rumania , and Czecho-Slovakia  --  over recent developments in international politics . They have been watching with growing apprehension the political activities of Germany , Italy , and Hungary , particularly the success Germany has been enjoying in its offensive against the Treaty of Versailles . The Little Entente countries feel that the new reparations arrangement and , more important , the German demand for equality in armaments are leading the way to a general revision of the peace treaties . The most pointed manifestation of their alarm is seen , however , in the extraordinary conference of the foreign ministers of the three countries which was hurriedly called to meet in Belgrade after France had defaulted on its debt payment to the United States . A general repudiation of debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , for between them they owe France the sum of $165 , - 000,000 . But the countries of the Little Entente fear the effect such action might have on other international commitments , primarily on the peace treaties to which they owe their present existence as independent nations . If Germany on the one hand , through its vigorous offensive , and France on the other hand , by openly repudiating an international agreement , should succeed in undermining the Versailles system , what will happen to the countries which are the offspring of that system ? The foreign ministers of the Little Entente do not know , but as they declared in their Belgrade meeting , they are determined to fight treaty revision to the bitter end . A REMARKABLE SPEECH such as has come from no other public man in Germany since the depression began was delivered over the radio a few nights ago by Chancellor von Schleicher . It may be that he was promising more than he can perform when he said : " My program consists of one single point : the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his intention to concentrate on the single task of reducing unemployment is in itself novel and encouraging . He said he had no pet economic theories and would in fact not hesitate to adopt measures tending to provide jobs even though such measures " might not be in line with orthodox economic reasoning . " This is in striking contrast to the position taken by former Chancellor von Papen , whose economic program was admittedly designed to favor big business and the Junkers , and whose utterances were laden with jingoistic phrases . The new Chancellor also differed from Von Papen in declaring that the hunger of the people must be considered before there is any thought of tackling any of the purely political problems . He said that all classes in Germany are dominated " by only one thought : ' Give us work ; we are not interested in anything else , least of all in amendments to the constitution and other fine things that do not feed us . ' " No less encouraging were his expressed willingness to disarm in unison with other nations , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paper shields , " and his promise to step out of office when his immediate program has been achieved . I N ORDER TO CREATE a " better class of human beings " the radical government of the state of Vera Cruz in Mexico has recently put into effect a system of social hygiene providing for legalized , sometimes compulsory , birth control , sterilization of criminals and mental defectives , and prevention of marriages between persons who are mentally deficient or physically unfit . The law is to be administered by a state Bureau of Eugenics and Mental Hygiene . Education with regard to sex is required and treatment of social diseases is obligatory . Birth control will be compulsory for parents who are financially unable to support children or for those who already have as many children as they can properly nourish . To make birth control accessible to all , with special provisions for conferring its benefits upon the very poor , is obviously one of the functions of competent government . It is also relatively simple . The more delicate problem of deciding the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give pause to the most confident administrator . Vera Cruz has entered upon a bold experiment which the whole world will watch . Meanwhile , in the United States , the quadrennial meeting of the Federal Council of Churches , though it failed to approve a resolution asking repeal of the federal law prohibiting the sending of birth-control information through the mails , requested the executive committee of the council to organize a two-year study of the problem of birth control . It is an encouraging sign . A N ECHO of the delirious period when Americans were ready to believe that German agents were responsible for every catastrophe and untoward incident in the United States was heard recently when the famous Black Tom explosion case was closed once and for all . The umpire in this case , Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts of the Supreme Court , ruled in favor of the German government . He decided that new evidence offered by the American government was inadmissible , for it failed to show that the persons held responsible for the explosion were actually German agents . The decision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 16 , 1930 , was therefore allowed to stand . Under the original ruling , American claims against Germany , totaling $40,000,000 for damages caused by the Black Tom explosion in New York harbor in 1916 and by another explosion in a munitions plans in Kingsland , New Jersey , in the same year , had been die allowed . In both cases huge stores of munitions awaiting shipment to the Allied countries were destroyed . It is fortunate that we can judge these matters calmly and dispassionately in peace times , and so right at least a few of the wrongs committed under the pressure of popular hysteria in time of war . This decision shows again how foolish the American people were to swallow the tales spread by Allied propagandists and misguided American patriots , who wanted only to drag us into war with Germany . R OGER W. BABSON has at long last found the only genuine cure for the depression . It is a wonder that no one else had thought of this really simple formula . " If you will make me the unemployment Mussolini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alumni dinner of the Babson Institute , " I agree to organize and train an army of men and women to present a nation-wide educational campaign to create a legitimate demand for goods . Give me a small portion of the money which public officials are today spending upon charity and let me use this money in giving a group of the unemployed supervised promotional work , and the demand for goods will immediately return . Then industry will call back its unemployed , and before long business will be back to normal . " Marvelous ! All we have to do is to return to the days of high-pressure salesmanship which led to the speculative boom of four and five years ago . What we need is to go in for another orgy of buying , though Mr. Babson neglects to tell us where the necessary money is to come from . This would solve everything , including , presumably , the war debts , the tariff , and similar problems . These problems , in fact , Mr. Babson apparently dismisses as of little importance , for in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything which " governments and bankers can do to prevent it . " Incidentally , he said the same thing a year ago . A A SYMBOL of the rising tide of economic nationalism let us consider the Tabasco Sauce Affair in the British House of Commons . A hawk-eyed member discovered that the tabasco bottle in the House restaurant bore a label showing that the sauce was made in the State of Louisiana . Immediately his patriotic zeal burned fiercer than the fiery fluid . The matter was aired on the floor , a question was put , an investigation was ordered , a report was made , an apology was offered , a promise to reform was recorded , the affair was closed . Hereafter tabasco sauce will be of British make , and the honor and economic self-sufficiency of the Empire will be further secured . And before our next issue goes to press we shall doubtless be able to report that the Senate and House restaurants in Washington are ordering their Worcestershire sauce from New Orleans .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
