Last week the Federal Farm Board went on trial for its life before the Senate Committee on Agriculture . Lifted for the first time was the cloak of official secrecy with which for 28 months it had guarded the details of the Board 's wheat and cotton stabilization operations . Curious Senators poked roughly into facts and figures which Farm Boarders had long feared would damage their agency 's economic prestige . What was disclosed served to intensify the industrial clamor for the Board to be abolished as a futile waster of public funds . Lobbyists for farm organizations were no less loud in using the same disclosures to argue for its wholesale revamping . <P> Prime witness for the defense was James Clifton Stone , the Board 's harassed chairman .
