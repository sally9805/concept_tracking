A BURIED TREASURE A STORY IN TWO PARTS  --  PART II BY ELIZABETH MADOX ROBERTS B EN fished in the stream all the afternoon , smiling whenever he thought of the kettle of money and of the two drab figures bending over it to draw it from the earth . The secrecy of the pot was a seductive thought , playing over his mind as soft fingers might play over his shoulders . Or , on the following day , still considering the curious treasure , he walked about among the fields and pastures , viewing impartially all that he met there , keeping himself apart . He went near to the house into which the kettle had been taken and he spied on it from a barn lot , but he saw no sign of good fortune upon it . The days were long and slow , the nights short , the summer approaching midsummer day . Ben wondered about the kettle of gold he had seen unearthed in the cornfield of the patched farmer , half expecting to hear some report of it when he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food for cooking , but no word of it came to him . The people were busy with the fields , the season for plowing being at hand , the wheat harvest approaching . Few came to the store to buy and none came there to loiter during the working hours of the day . The storekeeper had little to tell when Ben asked for news . Ben gave little heed to the country , letting it assail his senses in whatever way it would , letting the bells ring in whatever way they would without giving them direction or reason . Thinking of the pot of money he had seen taken out of the earth , he would remember hishome in Jessamine County and remember his mother and father moving vaguely about in a large house , and he thought that he would write a letter to his brother and ask him to send some of his clothing . He yielded himself to the unreality of the pot of money and let the clothing go unasked for , let Jessamine County and his family there sink backward into a remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills , the growing herbs having some deep business with what lay under the surface of the soil , the growing herbs taking first place and contriving cunningly to have the best . A day late in the week and Ben went to the village to buy , finding several people astir there . A hard rain during the morning brought an afternoon of leisure to the plowmen , the ground being too soft for working . Ben viewed the village , seeing the people come and go , and he lingered for a while at the store . He heard people say that there was to be a surprise party at Andy Blair 's home the following night . One or two said they had been invited and another , hearing of it , said he intended to go . " Old Andy himself invited me , " a man said . " Philly invited me , " one or two said , speaking together . " Said a surprise would come off . I wonder what surprise old Andy could have to show . " Ben heard one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk of the party , and all seemed to A BURIED TREASURE ; 229 intend to go , some with interest , some with but a dull wish to be where others were assembled . 1AThen the store was cleared Ben bought a pair of shoe laces , smiling a little within to see himself in this act , for he knew that he had no claim on Blair 's party . But in the event that such a claim might arise , he ruminated , letting his inner laughter complete the condition ; and he walked away from the hamlet staring down at his old laces and judging them unfit for a public appearance . He walked along a lane where the way dipped downward among cool green trees , and presently he saw that he would be overtaken by two riders . One was a lovely girl of nineteen or twenty who rode an old white mare , sitting sidewise without a saddle . The other girl was scarcely less lovely , and she rode a thin little gelding that was not broken to be bridle-wise but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her guidance without protest although with awkwardness . They drew near slowly , coming from the rear , and Ben heard their voices speaking . " I 'm surprised already , " the girl on the white horse said . " I 'm already surprised enough . " " I 'm surprised old man Andy Blair gives a party , let alone a surprise party . " the other girl said , holding the thought forward for further consideration . Her voice was sweet and resonant , hollow and tender , like the voice of a coo-dove . Ben drew aside from the way to let the girls pass , lifting his cap . The girl on the white mare rode easily , her little feet scarcely swaying with the rise and fall of the mare 's back . Her flowered dress fell in soft ripples over the white hair of the beast and seemed of a kind with the suowy coat that spread to the animal 's flanks and rounded over the plump haunches . The girl rode her beast with a stately grace , as if she rode to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for speech which was delayed in the moment of passing . The other girl came forward then , guiding hergawky beast aside to share the way , her pretty voice calling : " Say , Robbie May , does Imogene take cream to Coulter 's ? " The cry of the coo-dove went over the lane and spread among the boughs of the trees . This girl moved quickly , asserting herself above her beast with swift grace that flowed out of his awkwardness and brought it to a fine flower . They had passed then , the horses moving away with slightly accelerated gait , but they kept in view until the road forked , when they went away into the hill toward the left . After the girls had left the road Ben cared no longer for it , and he turned into a field where he walked across sparse clover . He liked the country well then , and he liked all that it gave and all that it promised . Having lifted his cap , though not his eyes , to two strange girls on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and a place in the community to make what he had done have value . He must have a house where he stayed and a reason for staying there , and he searched about for reasons . Reasons were not easily found , and he let his thought slip about over the country to contrive some purpose for himself out of the labors that were passing among the farms . The wheat was ripening in the fields , and be thought that he might offer himself somewhere as a hand . A man was walking about a barn enclosure , a ruddy man whose stride was long and whose way treaded in and out among the beasts there . His strong , rough farm jacket was soiled with the dust from the hay , and his hair lay in long pointed locks against his moist and reddened brow . Ben stood at the gate in respectful indifference , and the man came forward when he had hurried his work mule through a gate and had given his sow a measure of corn . They stood by the gate and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point too suddenly , giving their minds time to gather all the threads of acquaintance before the mouth was let speak . Ben wanted a piece of work with some farmer , enough work to help pay his way in the country . The other man was named Giles Wilson , he said . He did not need help for himself , he said , but he knew a man that needed a hand in a bad way , a man no longer what he used to be , heavy work now at hand with the oats and the wheat ripening . Then Giles Wilson went away , striding through the muck of the barn lot , and he cleared two pigs away from a trough where the calves should be eating and cuffed a mule out of the way of two humble nanny sheep . When he was striding about over the soft black loam of the barnyard floor , Ben saw that he had fastened horseshoes to the soles of his shoes to save them from wear and he saw that his feet made horse prints in the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rights he trotted back across the trampled way and he took up again the inquiry Ben had made . " Bud Stoner , yes , he 's a good man . Pay all he agrees on , " he said , " I went by there to-day and I see Bud Stoner , he 's about to get his house new painted . There 's work to do there . Pays all he promises . You go see Bud Stoner . " Ben sat under his ledge during the cool of the evening , adjusting his new shoe laces , or he washed his clothes in the creek and spread them to dry on the bushes . He decided to apply to Stoner , to find himself a place in some house , to belong to the community in some more secure way than that offered by a ledge of rock as a shelter , the ways of houses being now fixed upon men . There were lovely girls in his mind as the sunset faded , as the light slanted away from his small ravine to give his gorge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within , at the sunsets that are in lovers ' eyes and the slow dawns that are in their faces . His mind 's eye saw a long way ahead , leaping over the difficulties that surrounded him , seeing Robbie May and the other girl at Blair 's party ; and he thought that if he mightdance once with each of them he would be willing to accept his vacation as finished and call it well spent . Early in the morning , before the cocks had finished crowing for the first hours of the day , before the farm bells had jangled and replied in their sweet distresses of dissonance , Ben left his half-cavern and walked toward the house which he knew to be Stoner 's , finding the owner of the farm , Stoner himself , just coming from the house door to make his way to the barns . When he offered himself as a laborer he was told that there was no farm work to be done that day , but that he might paint the shutters of the house , and he was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the green paint , and where he might stand them for drying . He sat with the farmer and two house painters for breakfast in the kitchen , and by the time all had eaten he knew that the farmer 's wife was all but stone deaf and that one painter was named Larkin and the other Grove . He painted during the morning under the shade of a great tree , standing the shutters , one at a time , against the trunk of the tree and laying on the green paint carefully , teaching himself to be a painter . Grove worked at the front of the house , Larkin at the side , but they talked together , flinging out comments and reminiscences between long sweeps of the brushes and long periods of quiet . They seemed but little acquainted with each other , as if they had met only two days before , as if they continued confidences begun a short time since then . " Some days I used to knock down , anyhow , as much as six dollars , above my wages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , no comment offered , their brushes slapping at the house walls making the only sound . The morning was warm , the wheat ripening , the farmer running a mower over a field of clover . The click of the cutting instrument came up from a valley field . Grove made a lumbering noise lowering his scaffolding , and then his voice broke out on the air : " But you could n't knock down anything now , system they got now . Streetcar jobs are a mighty poor make-out nowadays . " The coo-doves in the trees sounded as if they were a long way off , making their coo-cries together . A cuckoo went into the dense foliage of a young sugar tree , assuming the motions of a snake as it went creeping through the air and penetrated the green banks of the leaves . Then Larkin spoke , his voice a sudden flutter of crumpled , unjointed phrases , a cracked voice uttering a crackling phrase : " Best knock-down job I ever had was ice-wagon job . " Regret stood about the house wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boards and spread it smoothly , making an even tattoo with his brush . Three times that morning they had agreed that everything was tight now , nothing open and free , that the good day was past . Coal wagons , ice wagons , street cars , wherever money was passed freely the new system was over all as a blight . " I can paint , but I only aim to work this job till I see something better , " Grove said . He spoke twice to Larkin 's once . " Too much like work , " he said . " Ever knock down anything while you painted a house ? " Larkin flung out in disjointed caution , speaking in a low voice . " Twice . " The morning was long , the farmer off in the meadow with his clicking knives . The farmer 's wife hoed in the garden back of the house . There were no others about the place . The windows were open , the shutters spread about among the trees . The cuckoo peered out from its hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail like a sword against the limb of the maple . " Twice , I did , " Grove said . " Get away with it ? " Larkin asked . " Sure , I always get away with whatever I knock down . Easy if you know how . " There was quiet and talk alternating between them . The brushes worked forward steadily , laying on the paint . The farmer 's wife finished her herbs and came from the garden , and presently she was walking about in the rear of the house and the kitchen yard . It was after ten now , the morning moving slowly , but passing . Ben would make seventy-five cents , above his day 's food , for his work on the shutters . The labor in the field would begin for him the following workday , Monday , and he would sleep meanwhile in the farmer 's house . " Once it was twenty dollars , " Grove said . " When I painted a man 's store over in Bloomfield . Funny part was , nobody ever put any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was when I painted a roof for a rich old woman in Fayette County . Money saved up in a green teapot . Oki woman so stingy she never missed it . You would n't believe me when I tell you it was three hundred dollars . " The shadows thickened for the noon of the day and the cocks crowed from farm to farm , bringing an end to the morning . After food and a rest Ben went back to his work under the tree , and the house-painters moved to the west wall . They seemed aware of him as they had not been during the morning , and their confidences were given in low voices . The farmer 's cutting instrument made its pretty clatter in the meadow , and the cries of the doves broke now and then through the trees . The light was hard and brilliant , lying densely over the trees during the afternoon , destroying the shadows , and hard brilliant insects leaped now and then out of the grass . Ben heard the painters tell each other of the surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it at the store the evening before and they announced their willingness to go . Any small pleasure that could be had in a country community was theirs of their right , they said , exchanging opinions that varied less than one hair 's breadth the one from the other . They always went wherever there was a country party , they said . Later they came down from their ladders and mixed paint at the back of the house , and thereafter Ben heard little of their interchange . He spread the green paint on the last of the shutters , having sunk now into the reality of the countryside , having earned himself a place there . There were bees in the air during the afternoon , and Ben thought a swarm must be in motion , but he did not trouble to find out which way they went . The grasshoppers leaped out of the grass and dissolved themselves into grass again . When Giles Wilson passed in a battered car he stopped by the roadside and walked into Stoner 's yard , looking at the shutters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the county seat . He made nothing of the heat , hot and cold , wet and dry , these being his daily wear . He carried a long , crisp , white paper which arose stiffly from his coat pocket . " And what is that ? " Ben asked , not minding what he asked him . " Hit 's a pair of licenses , " Giles said . " Hit 's a pair of marriage licenses . Wheat harvest comen on now , and I did n't know when I 'd get to town again , and Imogene says she 'll have me , Imogene Cundy , that is . You would n't know her . And so I thought I 'd get a pair of licenses this time I was in town to-day , in case the time rolled around before I went again . " Ben asked leave to see the papers , drawing them from Wilson 's pocket as he made the request . The shifting foot printed two hoof marks into the soft path , and the hand , moist and hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a marriage bond , prepared with decorum , founded in the law , waiting now to be served by some authorized person . " But / have to run off with Imogene , whenever I do it , " he said . " Imogene 's daddy , old man Cundy , he wo n't let me set a foot inside the place . Run off , I 've got to . " " What does Imogene look like ? How does she look ? " Ben asked then . Wilson said he did not know . He stared off across the lower meadow and frowned and said " Shucks ! " condemning his incompetence at description , saying again , with a smile , that he did not know . Changing the subject quickly , he spoke of the surprise party at Andy Blair 's home , saying that it would be that evening . He would see Imogene there , he said , and perhaps he would name the wedding to her . Anyway he would show her the papers . He had caught up with his part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work to name what day she would run . He admired the green paint on the shutters and said the house would be set-off when all was finished . He told again of the surprise party and advised Ben to go , saying that everybody was invited . He took the papers again and settled them to his pocket , leaving with a sudden good-by , clinking his irons on the stones by the gate . Ben laid on the last of the paint , finishing his day 's work . As he touched neglected crevices and looked over the wood , searching for flaws in what he had done , he felt a satisfaction in himself as a painter . His overalls were marked a little with the green but his shoes were free of it . Andy Blair and his wife Philly , having found a pot of money , would have all their neighbors in that evening to tell of their good fortune and to show the unearthed treasure . Two rogues who filled in the time between their rogueries with house-painting , would be present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before morning . The earth could scarcely hide so showy a loot as a pot of gold but that they would uncover it , once they knew of it . He wondered what his own part should be in the drama , ruminating the perils that lay about the treasure , wondering who had buried it under the root of the tree , and wondering how the ancient owner would look at Andy and how he would look at Larkin and Grove , and whose act he would consider the greater roguery . The air was heated now , the sun having penetrated all the shadows , the rays of light coming in hard , slanted lines across the air . He decided that he would be , as formerly , a spectator to the show . Dreaming over the last of the shutters , touching unnecessarily at crevices , he fell to dreaming of all lovely ladies and of Imogene whom Giles could not describe , and she arose before him as a remote smile on Wilson 's hot , red face as he looked across a meadow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ripe wheat and putting a stranger green on the still corn . Ben visited his camp to secure the things he had left there , and went then to Blair 's home , approaching it slowly in the dusk . A few hurried sounds came to him from the inner part of the house , and Andy came out of the house , carrying a basket filled with yellow clay . There was a sound of tools clattering on stones inside and almost at once voices began to approach along the lane . Ben lingered outside to watch the people appear , a few coming at first , others following closely . Inside some joked with Andy and teased him to name his surprise . A large group of young people came , some of them singing , and while these lingered about the door , Ben drew near and joined himself to them . The two girls who had ridden the horses were in this group , one called Robbie May and the other Bonnie , and presently he knew which girl was Imogene . Larkin and Grove came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a window , viewing all that came to pass . When Giles Wilson came , Ben greeted him and passed inside with him to stand among the young girls and young men at the rear of the room . Calling out that she heard steps , Philly addressed Mr. Blair with deference and terror , buttoning meanwhileher best dress . She could hear two or three speaking together at the door , and then others came . Callie came , bringing two small children who ran curiously about peeping behind shut doors and looking into hoppers and presses , spying out the place before they yielded themselves to it . Philly greeted her guests quietly , seeing Andy move uneasily about among the people making them a feeble welcome . " What 's happened to you ? " more than one asked . " What 's the good news you got ? " " Good evening all , " Andy said . His face was drawn tight with uneasiness . " Make yourselves welcome , " he said , unevenly . " What 's mine 's yours . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaps , the party , it 's not upstairs . Come down from there . What you think to find up a man 's stairs ? " The children came stamping down the steps and ran outside in their quest . " Callie 's brats ever were a forward lot , " a woman whispered . " What 's the surprise ? " two or three asked . " Do n't be in too big a hurry . Give Andy time . He 'll name it in time . " " Did you , Andy , get a pension off the government ? " " Did you get a letter from your cousin out in Iowa ? The rich one , what 's his name ? " " Or maybe he 's got a nephew struck oil out west somewheres . " " Maybe hit 's Andy 's birthday . Maybe that-there 's the surprise . " " Birthdays are no surprise . Men Andy brought me here over a birthday I 'd hold a hardness against him . Andy knows better'n to play on me any such trick . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself last week and hit surprised me not one particle . " " Surprise is what I came here for . . . " A fine-mannered hush settled over the gathering , the first commotion of arrivals being passed . " Give Andy time . Do n't crowd so . How could you expect Andy to name his surprise when there 's a rippet in your ears ? " they were saying . The guests sat expectantly down into chairs and passed the talk of good manners back and forth . Then Andy came forward , striding crookedly in his best suit , and he placed PhiIly 's chair firmly over the hearthstones , testing the stone that rocked slightly underfoot . Philly was standing by the door , but she obeyed Andy 's command and took the seat he prepared for her . " Let Philly sit in her usual place , " he said . " Do n't you , anybody , run into Philly . She 's not so well to-day . I do n't want Philly run into . " " What 's got into Andy he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never see old Andy so careful over Philly in all my time afore . " Philly heard the voices , " Andy takes pains over Philly to-night the same as if they got married only to-day . It must be their golden wedden . . . . " Others had come , young people corning together , coming singing along the lane . There was a throng assembled now , all the people of the near countryside , as many as the room would hold , the center of the floor being free . Callie opened the organ and began to play a march , filling the whole house with a great leaping of noises out of the reeds , the time beaten with the windy pedals that sucked at the air and blew up the music or let it fall away from moment to moment . The player pulled out other stops and the music became hollow and thin and leaped about as if it went off among the stair steps , or other stops again , and it surged with a brassy clatter , and all the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the places where they had been , making sinister faces ; and Philly saw that music is a strange sort of thing and that men are strange , and she reflected that music and men have a strangeness together . Then Callie changed the stops again and blended the noises in some more accustomed way , a march rhythm beating through the reeds . Philly sat firmly over the hearthstone as Andy had placed her , her eyes darting about over the company , her feet pressing the place that covered the pot of money . Back in the throng she saw the strange young man , the one she had seen walking outside in the dusk . She saw that he was a loose-jointed boy of sixteen or seventeen who seemed not to notice much of what passed , who sank into all that passed and let all have him . He leaned against the wall , his shoulder drooped to meet the flatness of the plaster , or he talked a little with Robbie May or Bonnie when they stood near . He watched two other strangers who sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the painters who worked at Stoner 's farm . While Callie 's music shuffled at a march piece , Bonnie and one of the young men began to dance , holding each other and taking little steps that scarcely moved them over the floor , shaking their shoulders to the rhythms Callie made , and Robbie May danced with her young man , using the same little steps . They moved out to the bare space of the floor and circled about . " Make these young scapegoats quit their devilment , " one woman said . " It shames me to see what the world 's come to . It shames me to sit still here and look at what I see . " " Do you see harm in dancen ? " Bonnie asked . The steps went forward in wormlike procession , and the music continued . Andy walked uneasily about , but if he passed near Philly he inspected her feet as they were set down on the hearth . " No matter if there 's not enough chairs to furnish all , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right tuckered out and might as well sit down and take her ease . " Imogene had come quietly in at the door , finding a place beside the wall . Giles Wilson stood beside her and Philly remembered her promise to Imogene and she pressed her feet more firmly down on the stone . Three men sat near together beside the door , drawn together to talk in low tones . They were hardly aware of the rest of the gathering , but they talked of their cultivating and offered arguments back and forth to prove the virtues of deep plowing or shallow , as one or another was convinced . In their talk the fields came within doors and the spongy loam gave out moist odors . " I always tear in deep , to the roots of my corn , " one said , but another , " Plow shallow , I always say . I 'll tell you what I 've seen in my time . . . . " Or another again , " You take a ten-acre field . . . " Their voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but flowed rather with the outside where the loam was sleeping , where it rested for the coming of another day of rain or warm sun . They talked about the power of the light moon over the dark one and they told signs and recounted virtues of sprays and of terracing for hillsides . Their words lay under the general confusion and were never lifted above it , but they were often heard clearly when the din broke apart and burst into nothing . Callie finished the piece she was playing , and there was a lull of the windy music , but the rhythm went over them , kept unbroken while the music rested . The rhythm was continuous , beating about , and one or two beat their hands together or they tapped the floor , and when Callie played again she but fitted the throaty measures of the organ to what already pulsed . The young people seized the rhythm again and danced upon it , making their bodies quiver , or they sang brief phrases , looking at one another with kind eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn-an said . " Devilment , it is . Look at Bonnie ! " Giles Wilson leaped out onto the floor and began to prance to the music . All the people present had seen the horseshoes that were nailed to the soles of his brogues to save the leather , and there was no amazement at the noise he made . He came to his place near the wall and stopped beside Imogene and Robbie May , but he made one last sally about the floor and ended with a prancing step beside the girls . " I do n't care which nor whether if I dance or not , " Bonnie said . " I just thought I 'd dance a little while I waited for Mr. Andy to name his surprise . " The dog had come in and it had lain for some time on the floor not far from the door . When Giles left the floor the dog arose and went toward the hearth , sniffing at the boards , but suddenly it leaped forward and began to claw at the stones , bounding about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . " It 's a rat he smells , " Rudd said . " I never see a dog so keen after a rat afore . " There was a great deal of laughter at the eagerness of the dog . They were making opinions . " Look at that-there dog . There undoubtedly must be a varmint under the floor , the way he tears at the boards . " Andy put the dog outside and closed the door , and the people forgot him in a moment and turned back to their pleasures again . Giles leaped once more to the floor and he pranced there alone , the girls now being beside the wall . Hez Turner and Rudd and some of the women drew near the organ and called for songs that were sung in the church , saying that they would have a singing . Then the pulse that poured over the gathering was used for religion , and a great throbbing revival singing leaped to the ceiling and beat up the staircase and shook the pictures hanging above the organ . Imogene moved timidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sat in the window looking at all that came to pass ; and she came at last to the hearthstone and stood beside Philly , inquiring after her health . " I 'm afeared you might be sick , Cousin Philly , " she said . " You do n't look so well as common . " Her feet were beside Philly 's feet now , on the hearth , the stone moving a little under their weight . " Hit 's about . time Andy named his surprise , " a man said . " I 'm ready now to hear what the good news might he . Bedtime is not far off , and I 'm not a mind to sit up to-night . " " Yes , that 's hit . " There was a clamor , wanting surprise . Callie set forth on a long jiglike song which none sang , and Turner , the evangelist , stood near the wail , nodding his head to the tune in apathetic hostility . Robbie May and her young man began to dance in their corner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began to tread the measures softly and decorously under their feet . Taking the rhythm , they used it now , and they passed one of the seated women who saw harm in dancing and made a slow path to the edge of the floor . " It 's a sin to dance to organ music , " the woman said . " I 'm surprised the floor , it wo n't open and swallow us all down inside . " " I 'd be afeared somebody might die in family iffen I danced right on top of church music . It 's time Andy told what his surprise is . Unconceal what ' t is . We 're a good deal out of patience to wait any longer . " Giles gave Philly a stiff paper to hold , saying as be dropped it into her lap , " Take care of my papers for me , Miss Philly . I 'm bound to lose it or drop it on the floor one , afore I know . These are a pair of licenses for me and Imogene I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my licenses while I stay here ? " Philly fingered the papers and , when she realized them as of great importance , she closed her hands firmly over them and pressed them securely together . Somebody had opened the door and the dog came in again , sniffing at the hearth at Philly 's feet , insistent now although she pushed him away . The people were curious of the dog and they said again that a varmint had hidden under the floor . " Hit 's a polecat , " one said , " I can smell hit myself . " All sniffed at the air to test it for signs of the polecat , but many were uncertain of what they smelled . The dog continued to pawat the floor or the stone , and several came forward to watch what he did . " There 's a polecat under the floor , " the house-painter named Larkin said . Both painters came forward with the crowd that gathered about the hearth , but the strange boy , Ben Shepherd , sniffed at the air and said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the young men . " If you want us to get that polecat out we 'll open up the floor and put all back again , " Grove said to Philly . " Let 's get the varmint out for Andy and Philly , " two or three called out . The party swayed , all the young men crowding near the hearth to sniff at the air and watch the dog . The two painters , Larkin and Grove , and Ed Sims pressed forward through the young men . Grove had brought the axe from the yard , and Sims had brought Andy 's pick . Sims was a brawny man of a great size ; the pick seemed to be a toy in his hand as he tossed it lightly , telling meanwhile what should be done , his great arm muscles leaping in little jerking movements as if they laughed together and were eager to show their force . " It 's a rat , that 's all , " a boy said . " No , hit 's a weasel , " another contended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search . Philly spoke out then , forbidding any to tear up the boards , but her voice was scarcely heard in the din . The strange boy , Ben Shepherd , came to stand close before her . She was not uneasy of him now , since he had danced with Bonnie . He was smiling , as if he cared only a little whether the boards were moved or not . " The lady says she does n't want her floor torn up , " he said . " Stand aside . We 'll put back all we rip up , " Grove and others were speaking . " The boards are in a manner loose . They 'll come up and go right back . No trouble . " " If a lady says , ' Do n't tear the floor out , ' you ca n't do it , can you ? " The strange boy was speaking to Sims rather than to Grove . One or two standing apart agreed with this opinion , and they dropped back out of the crowd , saying the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavered , swayed by Grove 's voice , and Sims called out : " A varmint is a dangerous thing to every hen roost in the whole country . Hit has to be killed no matter whose woodpile hit hides under . That 's how I 've always heard hit said . " " But if a lady says , ' Do n't tear out the floor ' it 's good manners not to tear it out . " Ben was speaking still to Sims and to the young men who stood behind him . " That 's how I 've always heard it said . " He was laughing , as if he did not care much about the matter one way or the other , but he kept his placr. before Philly and did not step back when Grove tried to push forward again . Sims smiled a long , slow smile and he flung his pick out at the door . " If Miss Philly , she do n't want her floor opened we wo n't tear out e'er single board , " he said in a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange boy says , hit 's not in good manners to go against a lady in her own house . " lie reached for the axe Grove carried and flung it outside the door , and he cuffed the dog out , closing the door tight . " No matter if there 's lions and tigers underneath the floor , " he said . Philly saw that the floor would not be opened and the disturbed hearth revealed and she was glad with a brief rush of gladness . Some of the women called for more singing then , and Callie spread a new song on the organ , the singers gathering near . Shepherd went back to stand beside Robbie May and Bonnie at the edge of the wall . The singing leaped up swiftly , the rhythm used now again for religion , and the song was like a quick chariot that rolled over the air . He s Turner was beating the time with his hands , himself riding on the power of the song , and he began to admonish with a loud voice , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and judgmentsthat seemed to be falling from the leaping music . Then he began to address himself to Andy , admonishing him . " I do believe Andy , he 's about to get Hez Turner 's religion , " a woman muttered near Philly . Turner flung out a long chant , his eyes on Andy 's face and his hands sweeping and pointing through the air close before Andy 's gaze . Philly shifted her feet about to cure them of a stiffness , and she saw prayer and singing confused , Turner 's voice being lifted continually above the song . She saw Andy groan and beat the air with his hands and she saw that the buried pot of money was not yet free from menace . Andy was weeping and tearing at his coat , rejecting Turner 's discipline , shaking his head , but Turner pursued him , crying over him , " It 's your pocketbook is your stumbling block . Lay your whole pocketbook on the altar ! " Some of the people were watching Andy closely , but some were indifferent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well used to Turner 's ways . " A party ever was a hard-to-manage thing , " Philly was thinking . She held tight to the marriage papers , her toes pressed firmly down over the stone . Wilson was speaking near her shoulder : " I 'm bound He s Turner , he 'll get every cent Andy 's got . He 's a master hand to make a man give up his pocketbook and all he 's got saved by . " " I 've noticed a change come over Andy here of late , " a woman said , coming near . " He 's as apt as not been in mind to get Hez Turner 's religion , worried and all . As apt as not that 's what his good news is . I saw Andy had something on his mind as soon as I came here . " Turner had pressed Andy down to his knees and was bending over hint to cry out his continual advice . " Lay your whole pocketbook on the altar , " beat over Andy continually and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you what I can do , " a level voice said , the men beside the door still talking . " You let me have four bushels of good clover seed . . . " The admonitions of the fanatic burst over the speech about the clover and ran above it , but when the outcry was done the quiet voices were saying , " Orchard grass , though . I take a heap of stock in orchard grass . . . " These voices brought the level of everyday into Philly 's mind , and she began to see oncoming days beyond Turner 's frightful voice and hypnotic hands . She thought of Imogene and Giles as being near and as being willing to help her , and it came to her as she turned the bond about that if they would stand forth to be married by the evangelist , Andy might be saved from yielding his money pot to him . She whispered a moment with Imogene and Wilson and told them what she had devised , overpowering their objections , talking swiftly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick he 'll let Andy be . . . or whatever ready money you 've got in your clothes . " She made her wish arise before them , and they were more than half willing . Standing he-hind her on the hearth and gathered more nearly together under her urgent whispering , their wishes arose to meet her wish . " You could come with me to-night to my house , " Giles said to Imogene . " I had a woman , old Mrs. Rudd , come one day this week and make all fitten for a lady . " " And of a morning I could help you milk the fresh cow , so you could get to the field soon after sunrise . And raise the little pigs on the skim . " " The sow littered to-day , for a fact she did , and it 's as much as a man can do to keep the field work in hand . But to-morrow is a Sunday and you could rest all day about the house , or whatever you so desire . " The steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-spoken things , the nodding of heads accompanying what wassaid . Giles and Imogene made their sweet final promises , whispering behind Philly 's shoulder , but Philly was calling Rudd and making known what would follow , asking him to stand forth and announce that there would be a wedding . Then Rudd 's voice began to grow out of the noise , a hush falling slowly . The voices fell away as if a swift rain had blown over , and one patter of words after another ceased . Turner left Andy and turned about , and Rudd brought Imogene and Giles forward to stand before him . There were whispered agreements , frankly spoken , bargains made , and the papers were offered for inspection . The people settled into a pleased silence . Released , Andy arose from his place and settled himself , growing calm as soon as Turner had moved apart , and when he had steadied his shaking legs and straightened his back he went out through the rear door . The words of the marriage went forward and the quiet held , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush . The house-painters left as soon as the last words were said , and several others followed them . The men who sat near the door came forward , with Collie and Rudd and the young girls and young men to shake Imogene and Giles by the hand , to wish them good luck . Words expressing pleasure and surprise were passed swiftly about . Philly felt a mass of pleasure arise in her breast to spread to her shoulders , for all the people were sufficiently pleased and startled . She knew that Andy would not come back until the last guest had left . The moon was bright outside , making the departures gay , the people lingering at the door to say another pleasant thing and another . Philly left the hearth to its own security and stood beside the door to wish her guests good-by , and all the young girls and boys went across the pasture with Giles and Imogene to conduct them , all singing , safely home .                @ @ @ @ @
