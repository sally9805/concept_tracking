THE single impression or particular vision most answering to the greatness of the subject would have been , I think , a certain hour of large circumnavigation that I found prescribed , in the fulness of the spring , as the almost immediate crown of a return from the far West . I had arrived at one of the transpontine stations of the Pennsylvania Railroad ; the question was of proceeding to Boston , for the occasion , without pushing through the terrible town ? why " terrible , " to my sense , in many ways , I shall presently explain ? and the easy and agreeable attainment of this great advantage was to embark on one of the mightiest ( as appeared to me ) of train-bearing barges and , descending the western waters , pass round the bottom of the city and remount the other current to Harlem ; all without " losing touch " of the Pullman that had brought me from Washington . This absence of the need of losing touch , this breadth of effect , as to the whole process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only without arrest or confusion , but as for positive prodigal beguilement of the artless traveller , had doubtless much to say to the ensuing state of mind , the happily excited and amused view of the great face of New York . The extent , the ease , the energy , the quantity and number , all notes scattered about as if , in the whole business and in the splendid light , nature and science were joyously romping together , might have been taking on again , for their symbol , some collective presence of great circling and plunging , hovering and perching seabirds , white-winged images of the spirit , of the restless freedom of the Bay . The Ray had always , on other opportunities , seemed to blow its immense character straight into one 's face ? coming " at " you , so to speak , bearing down on you , with the full force of a thousand prows of steamers seen exactly nn the line of their longitudinal axis ; but I had never before been so conscious of its boundless cool assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was presumably indeed because I had never before enjoyed the remarkable adventure of taking in so much of the vast bristling promontory from the water , of ascending the East River , in especial , to its upper diminishing expanses . Something of the air of the occasion and of the mood of the moment caused the whole picture to speak with its largest suggestion ; which suggestion is irresistible when once it is sounded clear . It is all , absolutely , an expression of things lately and currently done , done on a large impersonal stage and on the basis of inordinate gain ? it is not an expression of any other matters whatever ; and yet the sense of the scene ( which had at several previous junctures , as Well put forth to my imagination its power ) was commanding and thrilling , was it certain lights almost charming . So it he . fell , exactly , that an element of myster3 and wonder entered into the impression ? the interest of trying to make out , in th ( absence of features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and the joy . It is indubitably t " great " bay , a great harbor , but tu one item of the romantic , or even of th , picturesque , ns commonly understood contributes to its effect . The shores are low and for the most part depressinglz furnished and prosaically peopled ; th. islands , though numerous , have not grace to exhibit , and one thinks of to_the other , the real flowers of geography ii this order , of Naples , of Capetown , o Sydney , of Seattle , of San Franeiset of Rio , asking bow if they justify reputation , New York should seem t justify one . Then , after all , we remenber that there are reputations and repute lions ; we remember above all that the irr aginative response to the conditions her presented may just happen to proceed from the intellectual extravagance of the given observer . When this personage is open to corruption by almost any large view of an intensity of life , his vibrations tend to become a matter difficult even for him to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident facts fails to account by itself for the complacency of his appreciation . Therefore it is that I find myself rather backward with a perceived sanction , of an at all proportionate kind , for the fine exhilaration with which , in this free wayfaring relation to them , the wide waters of New York inspire me . There is the beauty of light and air , the great scale of space , and , seen far away to the west , the open gates of the Hudson , majestic in their degree , even at a distance , and announcing still nobler things . But the real appeal , unmistakably , is in that note of vehemence in the local life of which I have spoken , for it is the appeal of a particular type of dauntless power . The aspect the power wears then is indescribable ; it is the power of the most extravagant of cities , rejoicing , as with the voice of the morning , in its might , its fortune , its unsurpassable conditions , and imparting to every object and element , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrying , panting thing , to the throb of ferries and tugs , to the plash of waves and the play of winds and the glint of lights and the shrill of whistles and the quality and authority of breeze-borne cries ? all , practically , a diffused , wasted clamor of detonalionssomething of its sharp free accent and , above all , of its sovereign sense of being " backed " and able to back . The universal applied passion struck me as shining unprecedentedly out of the composition ; in the bigness and bravery and insolence , especially , of everything that rushed and shrieked , in the air as of a great intricate frenzied dance , half merry , half desperate , or at least half defiant , performed on the huge watery floor . This appearance of the bold lacing-together , across the waters , of the scattered memxrs of the monstrous organism ? lacing as by the ceaseless play of an enormous system of steam-shuttles or electric bob- ) ins ( I scarce know what to call them ) , ? , ommensurafe in form with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the pitch of the vision of energy . One has the sense that the monster grows and grows , flinging abroad its loose limbs even as some unmannered young giant at his " larks , " and that the binding stitches must forever fly further and faster and draw harder ; the future complexity of the web , all under the sky and over the sea , becoming thus that of some colossal set of clockworks , some steel-souled machine-room of brandished arms and hammering fists and opening and closing jaws . The immeasurable bridges are but as the horizontal sheaths of pistons working at high pressure , day and night , and subject , one apprehends with perhaps inconsistent gloom , to certain , to fantastic , to merciless multiplication . In the light of this apprehension indeed the breezy brightness of the Bay puts on the semblance of the vast white page that awaits beyond any other perhaps the black overscoring of science . Let me hasten to add that its present whiteness is precisely its charming note , the frankest of the signs you recognize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just feeling my way to name as the main ground of its doing so well , for effect , without technical scenery . There are great imposing ports ? Glasgow and Liverpool and London ? that have already their page blackened almost beyond redemption from any such light of the picturesque as can hope to irradiate fog and grime , and there are others , Marseilles and Constantinople say , or , for all I know to the contrary , New Orleans , that contrive to abound before everything else in color , and so to make a rich and instant and obvious show . But memory , and the actual impression , keep investing New York with the tone , predominantly , of summer dawns and winter frosts , of sea-foam , of bleached sails and stretched awnings , of blanched hulls , of scoured decks , of new ropes , of polished brasses , of streamers clear in the blue air ; and it is by this harmony , doubtless , that the projection of the individual character of the place , of the candor of its avidity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " tall buildings , " which have so promptly usurped a glory that affects you as rather surprised , as yet , at itself , the multitudinous sky-scrapers standing up to the view , from the water , like extravagant pins in a cushion already overplauted , and stuck in as in the dark , anywhere and anyhow , have at least the felicity of carrying out the fairness of tone , of taking the sun and the shade in the manner of towers of marble . They are not all of marble , I believe , by any means , even if some may be , but they are impudently new and still more impudently " novel " ? this in common with so many other terrible things in America ? and they are triumphant payers of dividends ; ail of which uncontested and unabashed pride , with flash of innumerable windows and flicker of subordinate gilt attributions , is like the flare , up and down their long , narrow faces , of the lamps of some general permanent " celebration . " You see the pincushion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City and Twenty-third Street , but you get it broadside on , this loose nosegay of architectural flowers , if you skirt the Battery , well out , and embrace the whole plantation . Then the " American beauty , " the rose of interminable stem , becomes the token of the cluster at large ? to that degree that , positively , this is all that is wanted for emphasis of your final impression . Such growths , you feel , have confessedly arisen but to be " picked , " in time , with a shears ; nipped short off , by waiting fate , as soon as " science , " applied to gain , has put upon the table , from far up its Alcove , some more winning card . Crowned not only with no history , but with no credible possibility of time for history , and consecrated by no uses save the commercial at any cost , they are simply the most piercing notes in that concert of the expensively provisional into which your supreme sense of New York resolves itself . They never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the builded majesties of the world as we have heretofore known such ? towers or temples or fortresses or palaces ? with the authority of things of permanence or even of things of long duration . One story is good only till another is told , and sky-scrapers are the last word of economic ingenuity only till another word be written . This shall be possibly a word of still uglier meaning , but the vocabulary of thrift at any price shows boundless resources , and the con seiousness of that truth , the consciousness of the finite , the menaced , the essentially invented state , twinkles ever , to my perception , in the thousand glassy eyes of these giants of the mere market . Such a structure as the comparatively windowless bell-tower of Giotto , in Florence , looks supremely serene in its beauty . You do n't feel it to have risen by the breath of an interested passion that , restless beyond all passions , is forever seeking more pliable forms . Beauty has been the object of its creator 's idea , and , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it splendidly rests . Beauty indeed was the aim of the creator of the spire of Trinity Church , so cruelly overtopped and so barely distinguishable , from your train - bearing barge , as you stand off , in its abject helpless humility ; and it may of course be asked how much of this superstition finds voice in the actual shrunken presence of that laudable effort . Where , for the eye , is the felicity of simplified Gothic , of noble preeminence , that once made of this highly pleasing edifice the pride of the town and the feature of Broadway ? The answer is , as obviously , that these charming elements are still there , just where they ever were , but that they have been mercilessly deprived of their visibility . It aches and throbs , this smothered visibility , we easily feel , in its caged and dishonored condition , supported only by the consciousness that the dishonor is no fault of its own . We commune with it , in tenderness and pity through the encumbered air ; our eyes made , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on it as on a poor ineffectua. thing , an architectural object addressed even in its prime aspiration , to the pa tient pedestrian sense and permittim thereby a relation of intimacy . It wa+ to speak to me audibly enough on tw ( or three other occasions ? even throng the thick of that frenzy of Broadwa just where Broadway receives from Wal Street the fiercest application of the mad dening lash ; it was to put its tragic cite there with irresistible lucidity . " Ye : the wretched figure I am making is a little as you see my fault ? it is the fauI of the buildings whose very first car is to deprive churches of their visibilits There are but two or three ? two or three outward and visible churches ? left in New York anyway , ' as you must have noticed , and even they are hideously threatened : a fact at which no one , indeed , appears to be shocked , from which no one draws the least of the inferences that stick straight out of it , which every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable stupidity or with remarkable cynicism . " So , at any rate , they may still effectively communicate , ruddy-brown ( where not browny-black ) old Trinity and any pausing , any attending survivor of the clearer age ? and there is yet more of the bitterness of history to be tasted in such a tacit passage , as I shall presently show . Was it not the bitterness of history , meanwhile , that on that day of circumnavigation , that day of highest intensity of impression , of which I began by speaking , the ancient rotunda of Castle Garden , viewed from just opposite , should have lurked there as a vague nonentity ? One had known it from far , far back and with the indelibility of the childish vision ? from the time when it was the commodious concert-hall of New York , the firmament of long-extinguished stars ; in spite of which extinction there outlives for me the image of the infant phenomenon Adelina Patti , whom ( another large-eyed infant ) I had been benevolently taken to hear : Adelina Patti , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hussarlike red jacket , mounted on an armchair , its back supporting her , wheeled to the front of the stage and warbling like a tiny thrush even in the nest . Shabby , shrunken , barely discernible to-day , the ancient rotunda , adjusted to other uses . had afterwards , for many decades , carried on a conspicuous life ? and it was the present remoteness , the repudiated barbarism of all this , foreshortened by one 's own experience , that dropped the acid into the cup . The skyscrapers and the league-long bridges , present and to come , marked the point where the age ? the age for which Castle Garden could have been , in its day , a " value " had come out . That in itself was nothing ? ages do come out , as a matter of course , so far from where they have gone in . But it had done so , the latter half of the nineteenth century , in one 's own more or less immediate presence ; the difference , from pole to pole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of its aspects was lost . This impact of the whole condensed past at once produced a horrible , hateful sense of personal antiquity . Yet was it after all that those monsters of the mere market as I have called them , had more to say , on the question of " effect , " than I had at first allowed ? ? since they are the element that looms largest for me through a particular impression , with remembered parts and pieces melting together rather richly now , of " down-town " seen and felt from the " Felt " ? I use that word , I dare say , all presumptuously , for a relation to matters of magnitude and mystery that I could begin neither to measure nor to penetrate , hovering about them only in magnanimous wonder , staring at them as at a world of immovably closed doors behind which immense " material " lurked , material for the artist , the painter of life , as we say , who should n't have begun so early and so fatally to fall away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an intellectual adventure forever renounced , was surely enough a state of feeling , and indeed in presence of the different half-hours , as memory presents them , at which I gave myself up both to the thrill of Walt Street ( by which I mean that of the whole wide edge of the whirlpool ) , and the too accepted , too irredeemable ignorance , I am at a loss to see what intensity of response was wanting . The imagination might have responded more if there had been a slightly less settled inability to understand what every one , what any one , was really doing ; but the picture , as it comes back to me , is , for all this foolish subjective poverty , so crowded with its features that I rejoice , I confess , in not having more of them to handle . No open apprehension , even if it be as open as a public vehicle plying for hire , can carry more than a certain amount of life , of a kind ; and there was nothing at play in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during these glimpses , that did n't scramble for admission into mine very much as I had seen the mob seeking entrance to an up-town or a down-town electric car fight for life at one of the apertures . If it had been the final function of the Bay to make one feel one 's age , so , assuredly , the mouth of Wall Street proclaimed it , for one 's private ear , distinctly enough ; the breath of existence being taken , wherever one turned , as that of youth on the run and with the prize of the race in sight , and the new landmarks crushing the old quite as violent children stamp on snails and caterpillars . The hour I first recall was a morning of winter drizzle and mist , of dense fog in the Bay , one of the strangest sights of which I was on my way to enjoy ; and I had stopped in the heart of the business quarter to pick up a friend who was to be my companion . The weather , such as it was , worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it drifted and hung very much as about the flanks and summits of emergent mountainmasses ? for , to be just all round , there was some evidence of their having a message for the eyes , Let me parenthesize , once for all , that there are other glimpses of this message , up and down the city , frequently to be caught ; lights and shades of winter and summer air , of the literally " finishing " afternoon in particular , when refinement of modelling descends from the skies and lends the white towers , all new and crude and commercial and over-windowed as they are , a fleeting distinction . The morning I speak of offered me my first chance of seeing one of them from the inside ? which was an opportunity I sought again , repeatedly , in respect to others ; and I became conscious of the force with which this vision of their prodigious working , and of the multitudinous life , as if each were a swarming city in itself , that they are capable of housing , may beget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of the restless analyist , the impulse to describe and present the facts and express the sense of them . Each of these huge constructed and compressed communities , throbbing , through its myriad arteries and pores , with a single passion , even as a complicated watch throbs with the one purpose of telling you the hour and the minute , testified overwhelmingly to the character of New York ? and the passion of the restless analyst , on his side , is for the extraction of character . But there would be too much to say , just here , were this incurable eccentric to let himself go ; the impression in question , fed by however brief an experience , kept overflowing the cup and spreading in a wide waste of speculation . I must dip into these depths , if it prove possible , later on ; let me content myself , for the moment , with remembering how from the first , on all such ground , my thought went straight to poor great wonder-working Emile Zola and his love of the human aggregation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great shops , great businesses , great " apartment-houses , " of inferior , of mere Parisian scale . His image , it seemed to me , really asked for compassion ? in the presence of this material that his energy of evocation , his alone , would have been of a stature to meddle with . What if Lc Ventre de Paris , what if Au Boriheur des Dames , what if Pot-BoUille and L ' .4rgent , could but have come into being under the New York inspiration ? The answer to that , however , for the hour , was that , in all probability , New York was not going ( as it turns such remarks ) to produce both the maximum of " business " spectacle and the maximum of ironic reflection of it . Zola 's huge reflector got itself formed , after all , in a far other air ; it had hung there , in essence , awaiting the scene that was to play over it , long before the scene really approached it in scale . The reflecting surfaces , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York atmosphere , have yet to show symptoms of shining out , and the monstrous phenomena themselves , meanwhile , strike me as having , with their immense momentum , got the start , got ahead of , in proper parlance , any possibility of poetic , of dramatic capture . That conviction came to me most perhaps while I gazed across at the special sky-scraper that overhangs poor old Trinity to the north ? a south face as high and wide as the mountain-wall that drops the Alpine avalanche , from time to time , upon the village , and the village spire , at its foot ; the interest of this case being above all , as I learned , to my stupefaction , in the fact that the very creators of the extinguisher are the churchwardens themselves , or at least the trustees of the church property . What was the ease but magnificent for pitiless ferocity I ? that inexorable law of the growing invisibility of churches , their everywhere reduced or abolished presence , which is nine-tenths of their virtue , receiving thus , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively the greater that just then , as I have said , the vast money-making structure quite horribly , quite romantically justified itself , looming through the weather with an insolent clifilike sublimity . The weather , for all that experience , mixes intimately with the fulness of my impression ; speaking not least , for instance , of the way " the state of the streets " and the assault of the turbid air seemed all one with the look , the tramp , the whole quality and allure , the consummate monotonous commonness , of the pushing male crowd , moving in its dense mass ? with the confusion carried to chaos for any intelligence , any perception ; a welter of objects and sounds in which relief , detachment , dignity , meaning perished utterly and lost all rights . It appeared , the muddy medium , all one with every other element and note as well , all the signs of the heaped industrial battle-field , all the sounds and silences , grim , pushing , trudging silences too , of the universal will to move ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself , an appetite at any price . In the Bay , the rest of the morning , the dense raw fog that delayed the big boat , allowing sight but of the immediate ice-masses through which it . thumped its way , was not less of the essence . Anything blander , as a medium , would have seemed a mockery of the facts of the terrible little Ellis Island , the first harbor of refuge and stage of patience for the million or so of immigrants annually knocking at our official door . Before this door , which opens to them there only with a hundred forms and ceremonies , grindings and grumblings of the key , they stand appealing and waiting , marshalled , herded , divided , subdivided , sorted , sifted , searched , fumigated , for longer or shorter periods ? the effect of all which prodigious process , an intendedly " scientific " feeding of the mill , is again to give the earnest observer a thousand more things to think of than he can pretend to retail . The impression of Ellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to find throughout that so many of my impressions would be ? a chapter by itself ; and with a particular page for recognition of the degree in which the liberal hospitality of the eminent Commissioner of this wonderful service , to whom I had been introduced , helped to make the interest of the whole watched drama poignant and unforgettable . It is a drama that goes on , without a pause , day by day and year by year , this visible act of ingurgitation on the part of our body politic and social , and constituting really an appeal to amazement beyond that of any sword-swallowing or fire-swallowing of the circus . The wonder that one could n't keep down was the thought that these two or three hours of one 's own chance vision of the business were but as a tick or two of the mighty clock , the clock that never , never stops ? least of all when it strikes , for a sign of so much winding-up , some louder hour of our national fate than usual . I think indeed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of any sensitive citizen who may have happened to " look in " is that he comes back from his visit not at all the same Person that he went . He has eaten of the tree of knowledge , and the taste will be forever in his mouth . He had thought lie knew before , thought he had the sense cf the degree in which it is his American fate to share the sanctity of his American consciousness , the intimacy of his American patriotism , with the inconceivable alien ; but the truth had never come home to him with any such force . In the lurid light projected upon it by those courts of dismay , it shakes him ? or I like at least to imagine it shakes him ? to the depths of his being ; I like to think of him , I positively have to think of him , as going about ever afterwards with a new look , for those who can see it , in his face , the outward sign of the new chill in his heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who has had an apparition , seen a ghost in his supposedly safe old house . Let not the unwary , therefore , visit Ellis Island . The after-sense of that acute experience , however , I myself found , was by no means to he brushed away ; I felt it grow and grow , on the contrary , wherever I turned : other impressions might come and go , but this affirmed claim of the alien , however immeasurably alien , to share in one 's supreme relation was everywhere the fixed element , the reminder not to be dodged . One 's supreme relation , as one had always put it , was one 's relation to one 's country ? a conception made up so largely of one 's countrymen and one 's countrywomen . Thus it was as if , all the while , with such a fond tradition of what these products predominantly were , the idea of the country itself underwent something of that profane overhauling through which it appears to suffer the indignity of change . Is not our instinct in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of keeping the idea simple and strong and continuous , so that it shall be perfectly sound ? To touch it overmuch , to pull it about , is to put it in peril of weakening ; yet on this free assault upon it , this readjustment of it in their monstrous , presumptuous interest , the aliens , in New York , seemed perpetually to insist . The combination there of their quantity and their quality ? that loud primary stage of alienism which New York most offers to sight ? operates , for the native , as their note of settled possession , something they have nobody to thank for ; so that unsettled possession is what we , on our side , seem reduced to the implication of which , in its turn , is that , to recover confidence and regain lost ground , we , not they , must make the surrender and accept the orientation . We must go , in other words , snore than half-way to meet them ; which is all the difference , for us , between possession and dispossession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , haunted me so , T was to feel , in the New York streets and in the packed trajectiles to which one clingingly appeals from the streets , just as one tumbles back into the streets in appalled reaction from them , that the art of beguiling or duping it became an art to be cultivated ? though the fond alternative vision was never long to be obscured , the imagination , exasperated to envy , of the ideal , in the order in question ; of the luxury of some such close and sweet and whole national consciousness as that of the Switzer and the Scot .
