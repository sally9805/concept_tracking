 | ORDINARILY the adjournment of Congress is followed by a long period of dulness in the field of politics . This year is an exception to the rule . Events of profound interest and significance have followed each other in rapid succession since Congress adjourned on the fourth of March . It is my purpose to use these events as texts for suggestive comment , avoiding , as far as possible , the repetition of well-known facts . First of all , the municipal election in Chicago , when Judge Edward F. Dunne was chosen . mayor by a plurality of 24,248 , upon a platform which committed the victorious candidate to the principle of municipal ownership of street railroads , must be regarded as one of the most interesting political happenings of recent years . My article in the last issue of THE FORUM called attention to the popular drift toward federalism or governmental control of almost every industry . The election in Chicago was only another manifestation of this almost universal feeling . The people are becoming weary of contributing to the wealth of great corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon street-railroad stock , for instance , come from the pockets of the individuals who ride upon the cars . It is useless to argue with them that they enjoy rapid and safe transportation for the nickel which they pay . From their point of view , if there is large profit in a multitude of nickels , there is no reason why the municipality should not operate the railroad system as a public institution and not as a money-making corporation , and thus reduce the cost of a ride to three cents or even less .  | In other words , the people are thinking for themselves . The voting population in the United States is the most intelligent in the world . The time is past when men go to the polls like dumb , driven animals . They are reasoning and figuring , and , as might be expected , they take a very selfish and practical view . The sentimentality of party devotion has almost entirely disappeared . The presidential election of 1896 was a triumph of material interests . Thousands upon thousands then drifted away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfpreservation , fearful lest their accumulation , large or small , might be adversely affected . The same feeling was paramount in 1900 and 1904 . The municipal election in Chicago was a logical result of those campaigns . Elections in the future will be determined by the same cause . The voters will consider , first of all , their own interests . They will give little heed to platforms and candidates , except as these appeal to personal and practical considerations . There is truth in Judge Dunne 's statement that the movement in favor of municipal ownership of all public utilities has taken deep root among the intelligent people of this country . " It is no passing sentiment , " he says . " It is here to stay . Municipal ownership and operation of these utilities and governmental ownership of railroads , telegraphs , and express transportation are practical questions , upon which the people must pass within a very short time ; and the politicians and parties who ignore these questions must be prepared for a short-lived career before the people . " The movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public utilities means that the people , and not a few fortunate stockholders , will share the profits . Curiously enough , the United States Government has done more than any other single agency in instilling this belief into the population . During the past two or three years , the United States consuls abroad have contributed an interesting and valuable series of reports upon the various phases of municipal ownership in Great Britain ; and , almost without exception , these reports have been arguments in favor of the system . These documents have been widely circulated throughout this country , and they have stimulated the idea of municipal ownership to an extraordinary degree . Take , for instance , the report of United States Consul Hamm , upon the success of the experiment of city-owned cars in Hull . He emphasizes the cheapness of the fare , namely , one penny on all lines for all distances ; and he discusses the financial phase with evident approbation . During the twelve months preceding his report , the gross income  | was about $445,000 ; the cost of operation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " left a gross profit of $212,000 , and , deducting interest on tke investment and the sinking fund , left a net profit of $122,000 , or an average of $12,000 a mile of double track , which went into the city treasury . " He admits that wages are lower than in the United States , but he points out that the cost of living is less ; and the employees , he adds , are of an excellent class , Pully equal in intelligence and efficiency to those employed on any street-car line . He finds many other points of favorable comparison , and then he concludes as follows : These are the results of the municipalization of city transit in Hull . They give American cities a striking proof of the mistake they have made in surrendering their streets to private companies , that operate the lines for their private benefit and often to the detriment of the public . If the advocates of the municipalization of streetcar lines in the United States wish a good object-lesson on their side of the question , they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this report stood singly and alone , it might not be entitled to consideration . As a matter of fact , there are before me a series of similar publications issued by the federal Government , and all tending to prove , upon the evidence of United States consuls , that municipalization is a complete success . Mr. Frank W. Mahin , for instance , reports in regard to Leicester that for the first half of 1904 the net profits of the municipal gas-works were $110,000 ; of the electric-light works , $12,500 ; and of the water-works , $44,000 . " All this surplus , " he remarks significantly , " goes to reduce taxes or to benefit the public in other ways . " From Leeds comes the statement that the operation of the tramways by the city authorities for twelve months showed a surplus of over $286 , - 000 , " which was turned over to the city treasurer to be used in reducing the city taxes . " Advances in wages were given to the employees , and every three months bonuses are allowed motormen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , " said the consul , " is benefited in two ways ? by having low street-car fares and a reduction in taxation . " Nor is this all . Mr. James Boyle , the United States consul at Liverpool , has written most entertainingly and instructively concerning the development of municipal socialism in Great Britain . We learn from him that at the time he made his report there were in Great Britain 931 municipalities owning water-works , 99 owning the street railroads or tramways , 240 owning the gas-works , and 181 supplying electricity . Every one knows how far advanced Glasgow is in the matter of municipal ownership . It may not be so well known that Liverpool is also  | one of the foremost cities in municipal socialism . It owns the waterworks , one of the best systems in the world ; it operates the street cars ; it supplies the electric light and power ; it has one of the largest and best public-bath systems anywhere , including one of the finest Turkish baths in Europe ; it provides public laundries for the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the slums ; it sells sterilized milk for the children of the poor at cost price ; it has a salaried organist to play its famous municipal organ ; it gives municipal lectures ? and all these in addition to the usual undertakings of municipalities , such as parks with concerts , technical schools , etc . The greatest work accomplished in Liverpool , however , is that of providing dwellings for the very poor in the place of unsanitary buildings , which are demolished as fast as possible . Further examination into the facts of municipal ownership in Great Britain , as presented by our consuls , reveals a condition of affairs of which an American public has probably only a most inadequate conception . Several towns , such as Doncaster , Chester , and Lincoln , are the owners of race courses , from which they derive considerable income ? sufficient , in the case of the first-named town , to enable the corporation to do away with the borough rate . The corporation of Bath owns the hot springs , nearly all the cold springs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently expended $150,000 in a magnificent promenade ; Bournemouth owns the winter gardens and the golf links ; Brighton enjoys a large revenue from its pavilion and aquarium ; Colchester owns the Colne oyster fishery ; Birkenhead operates a municipal ferry system between that city and Liverpool ; St. Helen 's supplies sterilized milk ; Southport possesses a municipal amusement park , which brings in considerable revenue ; and Nottingham , Wolverhampton , and Birmingham maintain city sewerage farms , the latter city selling farm stock , wool , crops , and milk to the value of $125,000 per year . In summing up the results of the experiment in Great Britain , Mr. Boyle makes these pertinent suggestions : The claim is made that the best-governed towns in Great Britain and the towns that have the least taxes are those where municipal socialism prevails . But this claim is strongly controverted , especially as to ultimate results ; and the opponents of muncipial socialism charge against that system a tendency to extravagance , jobbery , official indifference , and lethargy : and the broader charge is made that the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be kept in mind , in connection with this criticism , that municipal socialism has in some cases been embarked upon almost out of necessity ? as , for instance , in the case of the housing of the poor in Liverpool , where private enterprise has not only  | failed absolutely to solve the problem , but has not even alleviated its . most crying evils . Two observations are appropriate to be made in conclusion : Speaking generally , municipal government in Great Britain is honest , intelligent , and energetic ; and , as a rule , politics has but little to do with the engagement or retention of civic employees . Not only the United States consuls in England , but also those in Canada and Germany have been active propagandists of the municipalownership idea . The system is spreading in Canada , while in Germany , according to Mr. Ernest L. Harris , commercial agent , " there is a very strong tendency on the part of the state or municipal authorities , as the case may be , to secure control of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Harris helps along the cause by remarking that " Government control of all such enterprises has led to a great rivalry among the large cities of the empire in striving to be first in the application of the newest methods and latest inventions known to science . " This presentation of the interesting facts concerning municipal ownership abroad is warranted by several considerations . In the first place , I do not believe that the American people have anything like an adequate idea of the extent to which the experiment has been adopted in other countries ; nor do I think that we , as a nation , have appreciated the work which has been done by our consuls in fanning into a blaze the slumbering embers of American socialism . Most important of all , however , is the probability that this question of municipal ownership will become a great political issue in the future . There is already talk of a movement in New York City toward municipal control of public utilities , and the subject is certain to be uppermost in the minds of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voters . It is already announced that Mr. Bryan purposes next fall to make a tour of the world for the express purpose of investigating this question . The newspapers , always on the alert for contributions upon the foremost topic , are discussing the subject from every point of view ; and the Chicago " Tribune " has already sent abroad one of its most intelligent and accurate correspondents , Mr. Raymond Patterson , to gather every possible detail of information . The leaders of the radical wing of the Democratic party will gladly welcome " social democracy " as a new issue . If they do no more , they can point to the spectacle of a Republican administration demanding from Congress federal control of railroad rates and to the federal ownership of transportation facilities in the case of the acquisition of the stock  | of the Panama railway and steamship lines . The cry for municipal ownership will be in harmony with the chorus of denunciation of trusts and corporations . It would not be surprising to see Mr. Bryan return from his contemplated trip an apostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulation of facts such as have already been presented in this article , to present the subject with the same eloquence and plausibility which marked his treatment of the silver question . The tariff question bids fair to be the other principal political issue of the near future . During the session of Congress last winter , President Roosevelt called attention to the fact that , unless the federal authorities were expressly directed to purchase in the United States all the supplies necessary in the construction of the Panama canal , it would be more economical to make these purchases in the open markets of the world . Congress failed to heed the President 's suggestion . With characteristic directness of purpose , however , he announced that , as Congress had ignored the problem , he purposed to deal with it in a way that appealed more forcibly to his sense of duty . In other words , he did not feel justified in limiting Panama Canal purchases to the United States and thus adding $20,000,000 to the cost of the enterprise . It is difficult to exaggerate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand-patters " stood aghast . The President had executed a flank movement which made tariff revision a certainty . His position was an official , authoritative declaration , from the highest possible source , that , through the operation of the tariff barrier , American citizens were being compelled to pay unnecessarily high prices for articles of American manufacture . It will be remembered that during the last session of Congress , Representative Babcock , of Wisconsin , and other advocates of tariff revision , cited many products of this country which were sold more cheaply to the foreign purchaser than to the home consumer . The opponents of revision , following the late Senator Hanna 's advice to " stand pat , " prevented any legislation , and Mr. Babcock and his colleagues were temporarily hushed . It is easy to imagine , however , the confidence with which they will return to the assault when Congress meets in extra session next fall . They will have behind them every thoughtful American voter , regardless of party , who will want to know why the policy prescribed by the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the poor individual .  | The next Congress will be overwhelmingly Republican . On all matters of party policy the majority will be so great that the Democrats will hardly deem it worth while to demand a call of the roll . At the same time , it is worth while to remember that an unusually large number of the members of the next Congress will be new men , who will be more apt to follow the leadership of the President than of the coterie which will attempt to dominate the attitude of the House upon the tariff question . These men will be fresh from the people , as the saying is , and they will look upon the subject from a point of view not altogether satisfactory to the anti-revisionists . The new members from the Western States may especially be expected to advocate reform . So intense was the feeling created by the President 's action , and so earnest was the protest from Speaker Cannon , Representative Dalzell , Representative Grosvenor , and other prominent " stand-patters , " that it was finally agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be chartered and not purchased , and that only supplies imperatively demanded should be secured . The ultimate determination of the Administration 's position is to be left to Congress . This means a certain precipitation of a tariff debate in the next session . The President will , while this is in progress , stand aside , calmly awaiting the verdict . If Congress shall decree the purchase of all supplies in the American market , without regard to the increased cost thereby entailed , the President and the canal commission will accept that decision , but will , of course , be relieved from all responsibility . In the mean time , we may expect that both revisionists and antirevisionists will gird themselves for the contest . It will be a battle royal . For three or four years members of the reform element in the Republican party have been trying to secure action on the tariff . They have argued , and with considerable plausibility , that if the Republican party did not correct the manifest inequalities and abuses , the people would revolt and place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic party . It was better , from the point of view of the reformers , to have the tariff dealt with in the house of its friends than in that of its enemies . All their arguments and efforts were unavailing until President Roosevelt , by his decisive action , brought his party face to face with the necessity for action . The introduction of a resolution in the next session , authorizing the canal commission to make its purchases in open market , will confront Congress with the issue which it has sought to avoid . No longer , like the ostrich , can it hide its head in the sand and vainly imagine that all is peace ,  | The discussion of the tariff question and the attempt to solve the problem of open-market purchases are , of course , fraught with grave danger . The President is not , however , one who believes in weak and indeterminate dealing with a vital question . He sees that with the growth and domination of the protected trusts a tariff struggle is inevitable . He would grapple with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus , if possible , remove a vexatious issue before it can do harm to his party . The wisest and most far-sighted Republicans agree with him . These men will , when the question comes before Congress for discussion next session , advocate a thorough revision of the tariff , believing that such action will result in intrenching the Republican party only the more strongly in popular favor . They will be opposed by the men who are wedded to the policy of the highest possible duties upon every item in the lengthy tariff schedule , and who assert that the higher the tariff the greater is the prosperity of the country . The nucleus of this opposition will be the Republican delegation from Pennsylvania , which has always stood for the principle of protection in its extremest form . The members from the Keystone State will find some support among their New York and Ohio colleagues , with the small delegation from West Virginia also in line . Where else can they count upon votes ? Not in New England , which is honeycombed with revision sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where McCleary , of Minnesota , and other leading Republicans have been preaching successfully the doctrine of a lower and more equalized tariff . Not on the Pacific slope , where the tariff-reform sentiment is well advanced . Not in the agricultural States of the Middle West , where the outcry against a protection that makes the trusts possible is especially emphatic . It would seem , therefore , as if the result of the struggle for tariff reform would be a victory for those who do not regard the Dingley schedules as sacred . It is impossible to predict at this time the exact lines along which revision will come , but it is certain that it will not be radical , viewed from the standpoint of the free-trader . The people will be satisfied if the change prevents the accumulation of great fortunes at the expense of the individual consumer , which is the case at present . Nobody in this country , with the exception of a few extremists , wants the principle of protection abolished . Its record of accomplishment will always entitle it to consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively few items . We can hardly expect , however , to be spared the usual juggling with the sugar schedule .  | Any one who has been closely observant of the progress of tariff legislation in Washington knows that the moment the sugar schedule is touched is the moment when the door of flagrant stock speculation and consequent scandal is opened . That is true , no matter whether the Republicans or the Democrats are in power . Each rumor emanating from the Capitol is utilized by the speculators in Wall Street to advance or depress sugar stock , while around the national legislature there is an atmosphere of the most unhealthy character . No one would object if the profits of the sugar trust were diminished with corresponding advance to the consumer . The fact is , however , that , in the past , when a new tariff bill became a law , the trust was always the beneficiary . President Roosevelt is a strong , clean man . He must exercise all his strength and purity if he wants his party to emerge unscathed from a tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Roosevelt has iterated and reiterated his refusal to be considered again a candidate for the Presidency . Despite his emphatic assertions , several newspapers , and notably the New York " World , " persist in predicting that he will be renominated and re-elected . Inquiry in various cities reveals the fact that this feeling is quite prevalent . Mr. Roosevelt 's enormous majority last fall , coupled with the allimportant fact that he is stronger to-day with the people than ever before , places him in a peculiar position . A man with less courage and strength of character than he possesses would , in all probability , yield to the almost universal desire that he remain in the White House . His purpose is , however , so fixed , that it is not worth while , in discussing the future , to take his name into consideration . Upon whom is his mantle to fall ? The question is being considered in Washington , despite the fact that it can not be decided for some time to come . It is now certain that there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Shaw , of Iowa , now Secretary of the Treasury ; Joseph B. Foraker , Senator from Ohio ; William H. Taft , of the same State , Secretary of War ; and Charles W. Fairbanks , of Indiana , now Vice-President ? these are the men who are to-day most prominent in the public eye as possible candidates . Secretary Shaw will , it is expected , leave the cabinet in time to direct his canvass for the nomination , and from present developments will align himself with the " stand-patters " upon the tariff question . He is a man of much force , and of pleasant personality ; he is a good campaigner , and has considerable experience in organization . Senator Foraker is one of the best-known  | Republicans in the United States , able , eloquent , and resourceful . Secretary Taft has had comparatively little to do with politics . His predilections have been for the bench , and , it will be remembered , he was a federal judge when he was appointed governor of the Philippines . In the latter capacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed much executive ability ; and while it is well known that formerly his highest ambition was to become the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court , it is now recognized that events may make him turn toward the White House . It was significant that he was named as the presiding officer of the Ohio Republican State convention . His selection for this position brought him , for the first time in twenty years , into active relation with the politicians of the State , and there is a unanimous agreement as to the favorable impression which he created . He is a man of much magnetism and tactfulness , and is universally liked . Vice-President Fairbanks , who is , perhaps , the only avowed candidate , is closely identified with the agencies which brought McKinley into the White House , and it is expected that these relations will be of material assistance to him . In addition to these men , there are others who , like Elihu Root , of New York , are available and would make worthy candidates before the people . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Henry Cabot Lodge once argued , when he was anxious to see Theodore Roosevelt nominated for second place upon the Republican national ticket , that the Vice-Presidency would in the future , as in the early days of the republic , be the stepping-stone to the Presidency . Most people would be apt to take issue with Senator Lodge in his assertion ; but whether it be true or not , it is certain that the man who wins the nomination must work for it . In other words , the day has passed when any individual , not already President , can expect a nomination through the magic of his name . There must be organization of the most systematic and thorough character . Except in rare instances , where deadlocks have driven a convention hastily to select a hitherto unregarded candidate , the successful aspirant has had behind him a well-disciplined organization , which has withstood all attacks and by its inherent strength has become the nucleus of the requisite number of votes . Politics , like everything else nowadays , is a very practical business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while honors are bestowed upon his opponent . Apparently not one of the candidates , unless it be Mr. Fairbanks , has as yet attempted any organization . All of them , however , are gradually advancing into  | the limelight . Mr. Taft , as already stated , was the pivot upon which revolved the Ohio State convention ; Mr. Fairbanks was the central figure at the convention of Republican editors , and listened with evident pleasure to an indorsement of his candidacy ; Secretary Shaw 's name has been formally announced at a dinner attended by his admirers ; and Senator Foraker is taking an active interest in the question of railroad freight rates , which is likely to be more or less political before it is finally decided . When the candidates eventually begin their work of organization , it will be interesting to watch their methods , and possibly , perhaps , to anticipate the result . As for the outlook for the Democratic party , not even the most partial observer can see any solidification of disunited factions . Judge Parker , erstwhile Democratic nominee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , points in one direction , while Mr. Bryan , through his newspaper and in various addresses , is headed absolutely opposite . Judge Parker urges the Democrats to return to their old moorings . He wants " real and recognized principles ? not a collection of fads , many of them useless and some of them dangerous and opposed to the historic position of our organization . " Mr. Bryan , on the other hand , said , in a speech at Des Moines , that " the last election proved the folly of the attempt to make the Democratic party a conservative party or a competitor with the Republican party for the favor of the trusts and syndicates . " Then Mr. Bryan made this interesting statement : " The aggressive and progressive element ? the radical element , if you please ? of the Democratic party is again in control of the party . " Mr. Bryan has supplemented this assertion with the announcement that his active participation in political matters of late is due to the fact that the radicals are once again in command , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the radical and progressive element more complete . " He has issued a plan for national organization , urging all Democrats to send to him their pledge to attend every primary and to use their influence " to secure a clear , honest , and straightforward declaration of the party 's position on every question upon which the voters of the party desire to speak . " This is his initial effort to array his forces around him . In an interview at Minneapolis , he said that " what is known as the radical wing of the party is , of course , in control now , and it is gaining strength every day , so that when the next election comes around it ought to sweep the country . " Upon the whole , there seems to be ample ground for the statement ,  | which comes from Mr. Bryan 's home , to the effect that he is laying plans for capturing the Democratic presidential nomination in 1908 . In political circles in the national capital he is already regarded as the leader of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he is not the nominee , he will be in a position to name the candidate . There is no indication , at present , of any action on the part of the conservatives to counteract Mr. Bryan 's industry . Their wing of the party is apparently indifferent and is allowing Mr. Bryan to lay the foundation for the organization that will dominate the national convention . It is no wonder , therefore , that candidates for the presidential nomination are not numerous in the Democratic ranks . The political upheaval in Philadelphia was one of those popular revolutions which are not unusual in this country and which may be expected when the burden of municipal corruption becomes too grievous to be borne . The people of New York will , for instance , drift along quietly for many years , indifferently accepting many abuses . Suddenly , however , the moment comes when patience ceases to be a virtue ; a wave of resentment and indignation sweeps over the community ; and the men who have prospered in power are carried into oblivion . This was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magazine writer as " corrupt and contented . " These adjectives have lost their application . Philadelphia is stirred by a storm of vast dimensions . This will have no effect upon national politics , for Pennsylvania 's Republican majority is too great to be neutralized by any local condition ; but there will be a moral effect in stimulating everywhere the movement for honesty in municipal administration . It is worth while to reprint here a succinct statement of the facts connected with this remarkable political revolution : In 1897 , Philadelphia owned and was running its gas-works . The United Gas Improvement Company made an effort to lease and manage the plant , which was accepted . The lees ' was made and is still in operation . It expires in 1927 , but the city has the right of buying it back in 1907 . By the terms of this instrument , the company pledged itself to pay to the city all that was collected above 90 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of gas until 1912 , all above 85 cents until 1917 , and all above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the city free of charge and incumbrance . At present , consumers are buying $1 gas , and the city last year received an income of $650,000 from this overcharge . Such was the " gas " situation in Philadelphia when the politicians in power sprung the proposition that the lease should be extended until 1980 , with the right to charge $1 gas until 1927 and 90 cents thereafter , in consideration that the company pay to the city $25,000,000 in cash instalments before December 15 , 1907 . The excuse offered for the rather remarkable transaction was that the city was badly in need of money and could obtain it most quickly by this means .  | The ordinance for the extension of the lease had already passed the city councils when the storm broke . Mayor Weaver severed himself from the local political " machine " and allied himself with the indignant citizens . He vetoed the proposed legislation . The newspapers , without exception , opposed the extension of the lease and indulged in almost hysterical appeals to the citizens to visit vengeance upon the councilmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the storm , Philadelphia ought now to have a clearer atmosphere . To make complete the work of reform , however , it will be necessary for those who have led in the revolution to see that , at the next election , the candidates of the " machine " are not chosen by default . This has been one trouble in the past . Men who should have been vigilant in the protection of the city 's good name have been indifferent , either refraining from voting or following blindly the leadership of a recognized " boss . " Nor must the work be left to election day . In the primaries there must be an attendance of men determined that none but good candidates shall be nominated . There must be , in fact , a genuine change of conditions . It will take energy , perseverance , and courage , however , to keep forever broken the bonds which have enthralled Philadelphia in the past ; but if these characteristics are shown and the results accomplished , the friends of good citizenship will universally rejoice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are quite interesting . In Maryland , for instance , a constitutional amendment is proposed by the Democrats which will have the effect of eliminating the colored voter . It is proposed that Maryland , in other words , shall follow the course pursued by Virginia , North Carolina , and other Southern States , in disqualifying the negro . If this amendment is carried ? and it would seem as if the Southern sentiment would bring about this result ? Maryland will be a Democratic State beyond question for some time to come . Outside of this issue , the election will have little significance , being confined to the choice of members of the legislature and a few minor State officers . In Virginia , on the other hand , the interest in the contest centres around men and not principles . By the action of the State Democratic convention , the election of a United States Senator is now a matter of expression of individual views at the primaries . This is a new experiment for Virginia ; and the two principal candidates for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to expire , and Gov . A. J. Montague ? are now engaged in a personal canvass of the State . A governor , a lieutenant- governor , members of the legislature , and other officers will also be named at the primaries . The issues are purely local ; and , although the Republicans have effected a new organization and are talking optimistically , the result will be Democratic . Massachusetts and Rhode Island will elect governors next fall . The campaigns will not open until October . Rhode Island has , of late , been noted for the narrow margins by which elections have been carried , and the election this year will be strenuously contested . The situation in Massachusetts has been made somewhat uncertain by the announcement of the present Democratic governor , William L. Douglas , that he will not be a candidate for renomination . It will be recalled that he won the governorship last fall by a majority of 56,000 , in a year marked by a Republican landslide , and his reelection was generally conceded . It is hardly likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of strength among the voters , and Mr. Douglas 's successor is likely to be a Republican . There will be some national interest in the election , owing to the fact that tariff revision will unquestionably figure in the campaign . In Ohio a governor is to be elected , and the Republicans have already renominated Governor Herrick upon a platform indorsing protection . In Kentucky there is to be a contest over the United States Senatorship , Senator Blackburn , a veteran in national legislation , being opposed by Governor Beckham ? a situation similar to that which exists in Virginia . As the season advances there will be much interest in the mayoralty campaign in New York City , an event which always attracts national attention . Up to the present time , none of the State Democratic conventions has been held . The organization of these conventions will afford an opportunity to determine the truth of Mr. Bryan 's remark that the radical wing of the party is in control . After the election in 1900 , the conservative faction of the Democrats began to organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is now reversed . It is the radicals who , under Mr. Bryan , are now working for preliminary victories . They hope to control in Rhode Island , they will seek to dominate in Massachusetts , and they will make an effort to organize the Ohio convention . In the Ohio convention , the two factions of the Democracy are led by men of considerable force , and their contests for supremacy are always picturesque .
