txt Encouraged by the demonstration made over him at the Republican State Convention Senator Platt has renewed his fight on Gov . Odell . He is making a determined fight against the consummation of the Governor 's plan to secure control of the Railroad Commission by the enactment of legislation which would give the Governor authority to appoint two additional Commissioners . To-night the Senator 's campaign against the Governor on this measure bids fair 0 be successful . The Wilcox bill , which provides for the appointment of two additional Commissioners without the man ' damns feature put into the Wallace bill by the Merchants ' Association , is tied up in the Rules Committee , with little prospect of its getting out . Senator Platt and Coe Dunn dominate the committee . The members are Speaker Nixon , Rogers Of Broome , Bedell of Orange , Monroe of Tompkins , Palmer of Sehoharle , and of Kings , Palmer and are ' the Democratic members . Speaker Nixon and Assemblyman Bedell are with Gov . Odell . Rogers of Broome , acting under orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the orders of Congressman Dwight , the leader of that county and one of Senator Platt 's stanchest supporters , are opposed to the bill . Assemblyman Palmer and are opposed to the bill on party grounds . Even if could be induced to vote with Speaker Nixon , the vote on the bill would still be a tie , as Minority Leader Palmer is irrevocably committed against it , and neither Rogers nor Monroe is likely to , go over to the opposition . While the Governor , therefore , has very little hope of securing a report upon the Wilcox bill , he has another card to play . The Wallace bill , which provides for two additional Commissioners and contains the Merchants ' Association mandamus features , has passed the Assembly and is now on third reading in the Senate . Senator Wilcox had it advanced on third reading to- ' day , and it will come before the Senate for final passage to-morrow . Whether or not the Governor can secure the necessary number of votes to put the bill through is a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' railroads are putting up a fierce opposition to the bill because of the mandamus provision . 7 William F. King of the Merchants ' Association was here to-day in the Interests of the Wallace bill and kept vigilant watch in the Senate chamber until the bill was moved to third reading . Mr. King will remain over until to-morrow and do all in his power to have the bill passed . As the bill has bean reprinted in the Senate twice it will- have to go back to the Committee on Rules in the Assembly if passed by tile Senate , but as the changes made In the Senate were merely to correct printing errors Mr. King is of the opinion ( hat the Rules Committee would have no excuse for refusing to re ' port out the measure , in view of the fact that it has already been passed by the AsStmbly . " The Governor , I believe , " said Mr. King to-night , " has been loyal from the start in this matter . If the bill goes , through the Senate to-morrow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rules in the Assembly . They have either got to allow the bill to come out in the open for final passage or stultify ' themselves . " This bill , which would j ; elieve the City Of New York from the disgraceful transportation conditions now existing there , has been thus far held up by four men , two of the opposite party and two Republicans , who are supposed to be under the influence of the Platt-Dunn faction , which is engaged in personal strife with the Gov ) governor . " Truly it is an alarming condition of affairs when legislation for the benefit of the people can be held up by corporate influence and animus . When the bill passes the Senate and goes to the Assembly I shall ask the Governor to request the Rules Committee to report the bill out , thus making this committee absolutely responsible for preventing a vote on the bill by the Assembly . If the committee refuses to report the bill , we will then appeal to the Governor to call an extra session of the Legislature . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Interurban bills will I not be reported by the Committee on Rules . R , Fulton Cutting was here to-day in the interests of the Elsberg bill . He was given to understand very frankly that there was no chance of the bill getting out of the committee . Gov . ' Odel/ himself is authority for the statement that the Interurban bills will never reach him . BOY SHOOTS BROTHER , Kills Him Accidentally with Revolver Which They Had Found .
