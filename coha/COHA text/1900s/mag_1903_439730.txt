Toe case for compromise was never put better , perhaps , than it was by moderate American statesmen after the great political compromise of 1850 . That adjustment , they said , had saved Inct Union : and they pointed out to the defeated radicals that the noblest polities are but a compromise . The Union itself , they declared , is a compromise ; so is the Constitution , and all social life , mid the harmony of the entire universe . With sincere conviction and a genuine fervor they dilated on the blessings we had won by being reasonable . Ilad we not won peace itself ? " With what instantaneous and mighty charm , " cried Rufus Climate , their orator , the measures of compromise " calmed the madness and anxiety of the hour ! " And not peace alone , but love . " How , in in momeht , the interrupted and parted currents of fraternal feeling reunited ! " Surely , they were right . The analogy of /atal ! , eaann011 sense , the experience of Mankind , crystallized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our human societies ranged themselves on their side . And yet , we did not rest in the pettee which they bad made . Their contemporary , Garrison , the abolitionist , must have known that all these things were against him ; he must have felt how harshly the strife he brought into our Republic of welfare and of opportunity broke in upon the soft music which ears like Choate 's were harking for . Nevertheless , he went on : and soon there Was war and death and mourning in the land . Some said that the , outcome proved compromise a failure ; more said , it was the fault of Garrison and of the other extremists on both sides . There was peace again , at 11151 : a sure peace for the Republic ; surer and deeper for some hundreds of thousands of young men in blue and gray uniforms , mourned a while by young wives and sweethearts , ? mourned without ceasing by dim-eyed mothers . The end compromise and the end of warfare were the same . And yet , not quite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which , one wonders , is that peace for which mankind , in all lands , all languages , to all their gods , forever pray Which is that peace which we of Christian breeding have been taught to pray for ? " The Lord bless us and keep us , the Lord make his face to shine upon is and be gracious unto us , the Lord lift up his countenance upon us noel give us peace . now and for evermore . " Is it the peace men win by bargaining with circumstance , by huckstering with life ? Or is it that peace for which they also strive who will not stop to parley , but shout , like the young Oetavius , " To the field " Is it the peace of compromise ? Or is it some other peace which shall come at last out of war and conflict , out of " confused noises and garments rolled in blood ? " There is no other question so universal or so perpetual as this ? for communities or for men . Civilizations . as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace . Continents are less divided by the seas than by this disparity of aspiration in the peoples that inhabit them . Asia were Europe , Europe , America , if in Occident and Orient men were like-hearted in their prayers for peace . Like they are ? all men are like ? in those few simple , primal hungerings and thirstings which deny them peace . We shall not go far wrong if we say that bread . and work , and play , and love symbolize all our wants , for the here and the hereafter . To have these , and have them rightly and of right , is peace ; else , there is no peace . Few of us , men or communities , but can have them , and // have them all , ? in a measure , and by compromise . Much has been said concerning the bounds of compromise ; but they who have spoken and written to the best pnrposc this theme have been students of communities , of society . They have reasoned by less or more concerning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the method of science . ' That , ? io doubt , was a right point of view , and in right method , for that aspect of the sohjitet . Communities of men are studied most profitably as one studies nature . Their characteristics may be oh-:served and recorded like natural phenomena . The law of their growth and their decay is a natural law , ? these laws they make , and the higher law , are only for individuals . The student of society may therefore reason about the hounds of compromise in a way not open to the venturesome searcher of the hearts of men . But much of our most individual experience comes of our membership in communities ; and by that bridge I wish to pass from the great matter which Garrison and Choate debated to a still greater matter from the theme of Mr. John Motley 's well-known essay to a theme which is oftener approached in poetry than in such plain prose as this I use ; from compromise in the conflict between the greater and the lesser utilities in society to compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More particularly , I wish , if it be possible , to work my way to a clearer understanding ? clearer than any I find in books , or in the talk of other men ? of what that is which forever rises up in men , as men like Garrison and Morley and the radicals of other times have risen up in all societies , to fight with compromise , whatever form it takes . For my notion is , that there is nothing in us , nothing in the human spirit , more curious and noteworthy than the strange impulse to fight at once with reason and desire . // But passing thus from compromise in the affairs of whole communities , whole societies , to compromise in individual lives , even though we begin with individuals as members of societies , with compromise in patriotism , we make , in truth , a great transition . Our purpose is no longer what Mr. Morley 's was in that finely scrupulous inquiry of his into the laws of the warfare Wi til error ; nor can we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gains and losses , reckoned by more or less , which will ensue to the individual from acquiescence and adjustment , on the one hand , or front resolute adherence to an ideal , on the other hand , or from some middle course . Far we have no standard of values in the life of the individual . We can hope for little more than an imperfect view of the conflict in , a man 's own breast , a dint observation of the forces which contend there fur the mastery of Iris nature . To begin . then , with compromise in patriotism . there is , first of till , the man 's own peculiar , personal vision and outlook when he thinks of his country . That , doubtless , is primarily geographical ; it began with the maps at school . But an infinite number of facts , learned he knows not when , of observations made he knows not where , and of impressions taken he knows not how , ? in travel , reading , conversation , ? have gradually been added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole has taken in his thought a mixed , composite character , far beyond the power of language to convey . Parts of the whole will seem to him wrong , until , nit of joint with the rest . Certain things he disapproves : not merely disapproves. but hates . Other things . and certain aspects of the whole . he approves not merely approves , but loves . There : ire . therefore , attractions and repulsions in the state , and these , far more than any reasoning of his about the state , will determine his ideal . A man 's ideal in patriotism ? Iris ideal 482 The Foe of Compromise . of that which he himself sees when he says , " My country " ? is very far indeed from being au affair of the intellect : done . It is compact of aspiration and desire . list no other man 's conception of the state , of society , no other man 's vision and outlook , is es-er quite the same ; nor is there , in any other man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the state . ' flue falling short of one 's ideal in , therefore , iDeVitable ; but loyalty to one 's ideal is possible , and a persistent willing and striving toward it . What is that which in one Inns . keeps alive his whole desire , his undiminished aspiration , while in another man , after a brief struggle , a faint beating of its wings , it yields to necessity , to circumstance ? Edmund Burke , I fancy , will serve us Lest for an instance of what I meats in patriotism . The warfare between his selfish interests and his tatty/ma-Ms , many of them high and tender , on the one hand , and what , for want of a better word , we may call his ideal , on the other , is revealed in his writings and speeches as similar inner conflicts seldom are ; for of all great writers and speakers of the English . tongue who have also been statesmen , no other , I think , has ever made so plain to us both his inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and aspirations for society . Now Burke 's ideal of the state seas , unquestionably , more like Choate 's than Garrison 's . His disposition Wan hopeful , even sanguine . Ills favorite conceptions , though sublime , were not ethereal . The order of things physical and the harmony of the actual universe were pleasing to him . Adjustments did not seem to him shameful . On the contrary , compromise , arrangement , correlation , mitered largely into his scheme . Ile could contemplate with enthusiasm an empire of checks and balances , of liberty and law , of force and restraint . That all should be practical was thus of the essence of his ideal . But if his ideal was an ideal of compromise , no man ever had a loftier scorn of any compromise with his ideal . Osu but consider his course in the two great crises of his times . ? when America broke with the Empire , and NG wit Fratic , , broke with the past . It is plain that Burke saw , throughout the whole controversy with America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? pressing in , as it were , upon the sphere and function of liberty ; in his ideal scheme of the Empire . And how he pleaded the cause of liberty thus outraged ! With what an intimate sense of it as principle and as impulse he pursued it through the history of the Colonies ! No Mall could speak as he spoke from a mere conviction . A thing he loved had been endangered . It was as if tissue and change had set upon some landscape familiar to his eyes from boyhood , and threatened to alter it beyond his recognition . When the ministry , with a weak obstinacy , would have struck down the free spirit of a new continent , it struck at something that was vital and sensitive in Burke 's own nature . It was at bottom a sort of self-assertion , an instinct of self-preservation , that made him turn upon authority as he ( lid . It was a lifting of his own head , a deep and passionate breathing in of the boon air about bins , ? its splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , to him , the one central and vital principle of society . On the contrary , it was in essence the same self-assertion which he made when the revolutionists of France , through a riotous over-growth and overreaching of liberty , endangered what was equally dear to Mtn in his ideal of the social order . His opulent imagination had decked authority with the richest trappings , graced it with noble attitudes and poses , and softened its harsh outlines with a tender reverence . Royalty was to Min no more utilitarian device , adapted to a particular function The Foe of 4S3 in the state ; it was the outgrowth. and the right symbolical expression , of it dl-cp ; u1,1 noble human instinct . If one said , ? ? The King , " Burke saw , with a vision denied to most of us , the long procession of the monarchs of mankind : rich , barbaric Eastern pageants of enIhronement : gestures of eommand , and high , serious faces of authority ; arms ofpower outstretched with domes or mercies ; sweet and moving episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SO1 ? OW5 worn , in proud silence , like a hair shirt underneath the purple . He saw the peoples of the earth , through till the centuries , turning again and again , from whatever hard adventures of facing life ' omitted , to loan upon authority and to fortify themselves with thrones and coronations . All this , and move , was passionate in his deep contempt and his hurt anger at the ignorant , impious assault of France on his ideal . A regicide peace with France was to him what an unjust war with Aineriea had been . It was a marring and distortion of that image of society which he wore upon his heart . So much is clear , I think , from what Burke wrote and spoke . The like is only less clear in the utterances and in the lives of other men who have had a truly passionate feeling for the state , for society . Such men are better known to us , perhaps , than any other class . It may be well , therefore , if we keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals Which grow in us from our membership in con while we attempt some further insight into the nature of that in the human spirit which lights with compromise . We most , I think , take account of something deeper and more hidden than the ideal itself . The question is not of what that may happen to be , but of adherence to it , ? of the kind and degree of loyalty . In every case of change in the social order , for example , we are moderate or extreme according to the readiness with which we yield to neces sits ' , or to some lens imperative outsider:1 lion , any Bart of our ideal . All S111 ? 11 chagges : Ire . in Met , of the of it victory either of liberty over authority or of authority over liberty ; and the conflict inside of us may be set forth in the same terms , though the analogy gill not be easy to hold .

There is a question of monarchy or democracy in our inner State .

' These dear , childlike impulses. ? shall we loose them for their play , or shall we horse and guard them with a wise and paternal discretion ? For 0 man 's desires are indeed as the very children of his soul , and he loves them With a parent 's love . Compromise , I think , is a sort of bourgeois paternalism of one 's aspirations , careful of health and final , frankly concerned wall the welfare of the offspring ; While the other sort of fatherhood is umre concerned with the high nature and the noble function of its princeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coarsen or cheapen his soul 's appetites to that they feed on ,  --  mercifully restrain them , and hold them bark from the joust with circumstance ; while another man will let them hunger , even to a death in the desert , if heaven send not ( 10,11 the 111a/Illa which they crave . He will not leash them or hold them back , but , with a kinglier love , bids them forth to the wars . But these analogies , for all I know , may make rather for confusion than for clearness . My own conception is not of a quality and habit of certain natures deleted material a // tit incarnation . Fullness and freedom even in spiritual experiences are neat-tunable without a free access to the life of nature and a full relish of all bodily itelights . Here , especially , ? though elsewhere it is not less true , ? the real nature of the foe of com. /nisi , may he intimated best by calling to mind the attitude , in certain moods , of that rare type we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better term in this connection . I mean the sort of human being who never questions his right to the earth and its fullness , and whose right , for that reason , may even go anchallenged by other men . Such a loan will choke on common food . Ile is athirst if he drink not of the best vintage ; cabined anywhere but in a palace ; naked , if his raiment be not of the ? OS tliest stuffs . For all his senses he will demand always " the best ; " that denied , he will rather bear an utter ; lbAhrne ? than stoop to any landlord 's , tapster 's makeshift for his comfort . Your true " fine gentleman . " if he he shut out front the palace and the king 's table , will oftener be found , like Lear , on the storm-swept moor than in the ale-house . The immanence and the power of the foe of compromise will thus be plain to many of us if we go no deeper into our Miler experience than to take account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and renunciations . But the part it plays is more important , its power is greater , when the question is of a man 's work . Now I think that as a matter of fact a man 's ideal of work grows in his breast as Burke 's ideal of society , of the social order , grew in hint . There is in every man a reflection of life , a vision and a sense of life , which he has got from observation and experience . It is not constant , but grows and changes ; and it is never quite the same in any two human beings . There is also in every man an inner vision and sense of himself in the midst of ; of him self projected into life ; of his single energy transforming somewhat , or conserving somewhat , of that he sees . The ideal of life is due to the attractions and repulsions of life as he sees it . The ideal of work is a part of the ideal of life . Neither is the result of conscious reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaS011 never sounded . They .111111011 from a height the will has never mounted . Of nevessity , the ideal of work is unattainable . Save in very rare and fortunate cases , it will not be straitened by any restraining sense of the limitations of one 's strength , or correspond at all to one 's actual talents and endowments . It will seldom , in any ease , fall short , of dignity and grave and power . Quite probably , it has taken its shape front the arc blental direetion of the man 's first curiosity concerning life . or from the figures of men , enlarged to the , eyes of inexperience , which dimwit may have erected on his earliest horizons . The hue and voilr of it may be traceable to the atmosphere of his childhood ; very likely , it Will have a general character of aeltieve ; tient or of sacrifice according , to the preponderance of lights or of shadows on the landscape of his youth . In all cases , however , and at all times , it will relate itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should ever realize it , in any of its stages of growth and change , is , of course , inconceivable . One might almost say that the degree of success which to man has in his work , considered thus as a striving toward a right place and it full share in life , is the measure of his facility in compro-mise . What is said of modern as contrasted with ancient art ? that it can only suggest , and never can realize or achieve ? is true of all uncompromising work .

Philosophy , in that use of it , wears , to certain of our moods , a mean and commercial aspect ; it has is veterinarian quality .

And it is of his lost battles that one must think if he would clearly understand why that longing and straining after life , which is an inevitable experience if a man is set against compromise , is so great a pain . It is , I think , in times of defeat , of deprivation , that is man 's sense of life is keenest and his vision widest . It is longing , and not having , desire , and not fulfillment , hunger , and not repletion , that quickens most his apprehensions .

But this experience is harder to convey than any other I have touched upon . All our conceptions of failure , of giving up , are in fact so softened with the idea of compensation , hope is a habit into which we so unconsciously fall from the mere fact of living , that there is to inmost of us no vaguer word than despair .

Tint even tlwn ? even in such ease as these were in ? circumstance and fate are not enough to wort : despair . It is no niece ? response of reason to events . It is not ass intellectual experience .

It is that in them , not fate or ciretunstance , which awes us its the presence of these souls .

The opportunity of compromise the besieger will be supreme only when , upon the ears that strain at the tumult and tilro silence , the misting note shall fall ; when , before the eyes that weary with their long gate into the mysteries , the woman 's form shall pass .

The , proof of a rigid adhe ? - ence to the ideal in friendship is not good-nature , forbearance , moderation . And yet these are necessary . It is necessary to adhere to one 's own orbit , ; lever disarranging the solar system of society by a mad plunging through the estranging voids . But the man possessed of the demon will forever strive to get through the voids . In the actual experience , the space which divides hint from the heart of his friend will seem no greater than that between the level of actual speech and conduct and the hidden level of impulse and motive which always underlies them . To reach that hidden source of speech and conduct , to know and share the true inner life behind the mask , below the deed , is the constant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sort of friendship such invasions will seem hostile ; they will incur a forfeiture of the alliance . When two lannan beings so address themselves to each other , the hurts they give and take are grievous ; they could scarcely do each other worse hurts if they were mortal foes . Judged by all our reasonable standards of obligation , he of the ideal , he of the too great yearning for the heart of his friend , will be guilty of that friendship 's death . But there is a still more dreadful tyranny of the strange power inside of us . Not content with the murder of friendships , it will drive a man on to slay his love . There are men who will not , even for the highest prize of all , consent to compromise ; who will not yield even to the most exquisite of all persuasions from self-torture to self- SaCrifiee , ? not even to that vol. , Mich is in truth the voice of every ardent : 11111 imperious desire , every longing , every hope and aspiration , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is all that , and more , in every Man that is not wholly intellectual or brutish . No tribe or people ever set up a Victory that did not wear a woolen 's shape . No mall ever had an ideal of lore that did not relate itself to everything in his whole vision of life , or ever 1/rely near to an adventure of it , through the profoundest of all human relations , without a truly altful sense of recognition , of the ending of a lifelong quest . If we should try to see how this ideal grows in a man , as see have tried to do with the others , Ave should have to go back to the very beginnings of his se n-tience and intelligew , . It is not surprising that many , striving to account for it , have been driven to the theory of an earlier existence and a transmigration of souls , so unearthly is the prescience and presentienee which it brings .

The need of sympathy , that is to say , the craving ' to share , with some other human soul the vision and the sense of life , is in every one of Os far older than the " natural " or the reasoned need of mates and helpmeets , and it long outlasts them . The crying out of it child in the dark is , no doubt , the beginning of the quest and wandering . The natural need , the reasoned need a man can satisfy , can satiate ; for these , from their very nature , belong altogether to the reahn of compromise . The laws we make for them , like those of our reasonable friendships , are of the nature of commercial regulations .

We speak of perfect , sympathy and perfect faith as though they could be felt and known together ; but if sympathy were perfect there would be no place for faith . It is never perfect , because no two human livings ever have in themselves the same vision and reflection and the same sense of life . Even when , like the gentler time of friendship , the master passion breaks upon the reefs of the dividing Darien , its great tides will indeed beset them with an onslaught far more powerful and thunderoas , but not less vain . Never once will the two oceans mingle ; never once will their estranged waters move with the same currents to and fro beneath the stars .

No Name of passion ever fused , no sacrament ever truly joined together , no long wandering , hand in hand , through days and years , through joys and sorrotvs , ever cemented , into a real union and oneness , two differing natures . A man will as soon accomplish that taller demoniac task of compassing and pervading the whole of life as this of breaking through the barriers of the flesh , and then , with one great roar and plunge , or silent mingling of the waters , eompassing and pervading the soul of the woman on his bosom . And the demon , if he hold the man to this , the cruelest of all the tasks he sets him , will make of him a murderer once more .

We have , indeed , in the selfvevelations of the mmfo ? tunate Marie Bashkirtseff and a few others , the proof that this usual and merciful atrophy of the tragical intpulse has not always been accomplished . But with the rarest exceptions women are not merely without it themselves , they can not at all understand it when they find it in a man . They can only fall to praying , with poor Oplielia , ? 0 help him , you sweet heavens .

For these two well-nigh perfect women , these high-natured men , were surely dowered with all that ever yet has entered into human love to make it glorious . Beauty and faith and tenderness these women had to give ; Hamlet , the refined , Othello , the elemental . were of a fineness and capacity to match such largess as life brought them . Both were by these voices called from dreary wanderings : one , from his soldier 's hard and ill-paid service ; the other , from his worse combats with the powers within , ? from that straining at life and fronting of despair which even Shakespeare , speaking with his voice , could only vaguely shadow forth in words . What , indeed , could be more contrary to all nature and all reason and all right than that such men as these The Foe of Were , served as they were served , so , Yawn , so impelled , should bend so readily to doubt and question ? Sacrifice , rather than desire , was no doubt , in the last analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both were noble . But a too close analysis would lose for as the whole and simple horror of their deeds . The main thing is , that we ourselves can not look upon the havoc these wen made of love , of their own lives , of the lives of these helpless , trustful women , without a strange response , somewhere in our own deeps , to that which speaks in the bloody passion of Othello , in the coarse jibes of the sensitive I ( millet .

This , of course , mean only of the higher sort of love ; for that , if it ever truly live at all , will long outlive the fury of our youth .

But there is an artistic necessity , like the other necessity of crises , to endow the heroes of tragedy with a natural , simple heroism beside this extraordinary and tinnaitiralheroism ? if heroism lie a right word for it ? which makes them tragical . In history , likewise , it is only by reason of exceptional endowment , or by the accident of birth , that such men ever mount high enough , whether it be on thrones or funeral pyres , to throw our gaze ? wro ? ? the centuries .

Strong men , bearing visible burdens of duty and of help , scorn them for dastards and for shirks. - Women , though they begin with them in pity , end in despair , or in contempt and weariness . Children do not come about their knees . There is no test OF standard of excellence lateen to our ordinary thought by which they are approved ; for out of their desolation no light or cheer collies into other lives .

If , after the fashion of compromise , we would calm the best of that in no which wars with it , we ' night lay hold , for our own Midnight hours of wrestling , of a certain vague renewal of hope and faith which sometimes , with an irresistilde resm ? rection , swells in these tortured breasts : a hope , a faith , that we are also parts of another order , ? unseen . vast , and free ; that we are meant to break through barriers ; meant to eat of the right heavenly manna , and to work with sure hands , and to see With an unclouded vision , and to love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace than the peace of compromise , the peace of acquiescence .
