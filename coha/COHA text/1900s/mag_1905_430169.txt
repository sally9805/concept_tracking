 | The death of Mr. Washington Duke , in Durham , N. C. , on May 8 , closed a most remarkable career . He was born in 1820 in Orange , now Durham County , North Carolina . His father was a respected man in the rural community in which he lived ; but he had a large family and to his son came no inheritance at all . The son began life as a small farmer on rented land . Under the old regime in the South the small farmer had slight opportunity to rise . But this was an uncommon man and no untoward circumstances could bind him down . Ability , energy , and industry had their reward , and each year leaving him better off than the preceding , by 1860 he had bought and well stocked afarm of 300 acres . He raised one crop of cotton and it brought but five cents a pound . Living in the bright tobacco belt of North Carolina , he early turned to the cultivation of tobacco . Before the outbreak of the civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tobacco , and in a small way was actually launched in this enterprise when the war came . He entered the confederate army . After the fall of Richmond he was captured and sent to prison . A few weeks later when the war was over the government sent him to New Bern , N. C. , and from thence he walked 135 miles to his old home . Arrived there he found himself the possessor of a neglected farm , two blind army mules , and fifty cents in money . But he realized , as few others realized until long afterwards , that there was a new day in the South ; and with his four motherless children he at once set about rebuilding his ruined home . In 1865 he was forty-five years old , and was at this advanced age beginning life anew with practically nothing , and in a country stricken with poverty and devastated by war .  | From small beginnings many marvelous careers have been worked out in America , but not in America have lever heard of a successful life begun under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laid the secure foundation upon which has been built up by himself and two sons a very great fortune . From the beginning their manufacturing enterprise was successful and from year to year it has grown until now it has encircled the world , and the sun never sets on their factories and warehouses . These brief facts will be sufficient to indicate the extraordinarily successful business career of Mr. Duke . But marvelous as has been this accumulation of wealth under circumstances unparalleled even in America , where the self-made man is almost the rule and where fortunes have been achieved with magic swiftness and in gigantic proportions that stagger the imagination , still more marvelous is the spirit that controlled this wealth and the disposition that was made of it . For Mr. Duke became not only the builder of the largest fortune ever amassed in the South , but he became the South 's foremost philanthropist . His helpfulness knew no bounds . He had come up out of grinding poverty , he had lived through a period of intense sectionalism and bitterness : but his character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried it . He helped churches , and hospitals , schools and colleges , men and women , democrats and republicans , negroes and whites . In these miscellaneous gifts he perhaps distributed more money than any other one man who ever lived in the State . But the largest recipient of his wealth was Trinity College , which will stand as a monument to his philanthropy . Before he began giving money to it this was a poor , struggling college in Randolph County . He brought it to Durham and became the founder of the New Trinity . Finding it wholly inadequate to the needs of modern education , he left it strong enough to rank is equipment and standards of work with the better colleges New England and other parts of this country . But , after all , the amount of his giving is not so significant and characteristic of the man as the spirit in which he gave his money and in which he sought to develop this institution . It might well happen that the will of a living college should be curbed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened that the  | founder or benefactor of a college has hung his own personality about the college like a body of death . The personality of Mr. Duke has indeed left an enduring stamp on Trinity College ; but his influence has ever been liberating and inspiring rather than narrowing and deadening . His voice was always raised in behalf of truth and right and always against bitterness and narrowness , whatever forms they might assume . The qualities which dominated his character ? liberality , broad-mindedness , and genuine goodness ? are just the qualities which having entered into this college , must make it great in its mission of service to the State and nation . It was for Trinity College perhaps a fortunate circumstance that after the civil war Mr. Duke became a Republican . He was a Republican from careful thought and serious conviction , largely because , as he said , he believed in the Republican policy of public improvements . He never sought office and had no relations to politics other than those of an intelligent and interested citizen . But , joining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he became one of a weak and despised minority . This might well have developed in him a spirit of bitterness and resentfulness , but it had the opposite effect of developing a catholicity in his feelings and judgments . Living through a period of civil war , disunion and dissension , he early saw the wisdom of putting aside all partisan heat and sectional hatred . While he had his own convictions which he maintained stoutly , yet he did not seek by force to impose them upon others . Many of his close friends and most of his employes were of a different political faith ; but in his friends he looked only for sincerity and genuine excellence , and in business he applied no tests other than availability and efficiency . So in religion he became a liberal . He was a man of strong religious nature . But his devout intensity did not breed in him any tinge of bigotry or intolerance . He combined the amiability of a genuinely pious and gentle soul with the wideness and generous forbearance of men who do things on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of Mr. Duke was his quick determination , after the war , to turn at once from the dead past , to live in the present and face towards the future . The war ended , he at once felt himself a loyal citizen  | of a reunited country and became wholly national in his feelings . his political and civic thinking , and his business operations . But these are in a sense negative qualities and might almost spring out of indifference to others and to their welfare . Mr. Duke was a man of action . With him gifts must prove their uses . He did not care for things that yielded no dividends . His very goodness was progressive and creative . A spirit of genuine helpfulness animated him from early life . When quite a boy he seems to have dedicated himself to the service of men . He once said : " Since I was twelve years old I have been trying to make the world better for having lived in it . " When his first factory had grown to considerable size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he organized a Sunday school in one room of the factory , and out of that Sunday school grew the church to which he belonged at the time of his death ? the church built for factory operatives and until now attended by many of them , as well as by most of the teachers and students of Trinity College . And it has been the policy of his company , wherever they have put down a manufacturing plant to build also a church . Mr. Duke never placed upon the College a hampering restriction of any kind and never embarrassed it by a personal wish or preference . His interest in it , however , was always active , and always made for progress and improvement . The College having thus been made strong in its search for the truth which makes men free and thus fortified by the spirit and the example of its founder , developed a power that enabled it . something more than a year ago , to promulgate under most trying circumstances a declaration of principles on the subject of academic freedom that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so clear-cut and fearless in its pronouncement as to startle the entire country . This brilliant victory in the ancient cause of free speech was saved from being an empty achievement by the working , undoctrinaire character of the College , which had been so firmly established in the principles of truth seeking and truth speaking , to which Mr. Duke 's triumphant example had lured and led the way . The College was not fighting for a mere academic privilege , but for the elementary and vital right to live unhampered and to work  | without restraint for the promotion of freedom , liberality , catholicity , national integration , and all the causes most precious to our Southern people , and for keeping alive here the fires that have lighted every nation in christendom on the way that leads : o material prosperity and to the intellectual and moral worth upon which depends all individual and national greatness . Mr. Duke 's philanthropy did not rest upon a weak sentimentality , but it was based upon a sound principle . This may be illustrated by a saying of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in imagery somewhat homely but shrewdly just and impressive in its very homeliness , a saying to which he on more than one occasion gave utterance : " Some people say that I ought to give my money to the poor . I do n't think so . They would soon eat it up . I want to give my money to help people who are able to feed themselves . " The benevolent and genuinely Christian character of Mr. Duke is illustrated in his attitude toward the negroes , an attitude assumed early in life and kept to the end . He was always interested in them and sought by all possible means to assist them . He was in 1890 invited by the negroes of Durham to give an educational address . He could not do this , but sent them aletter which was full of good sense and concern for the negroes ' welfare . He built and equipped a hospital for them in Durham , and all his life was liberal in his gifts to negro schools and churches . His charity to negroes was abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them as an employer . It is largely due to him that the relations between the negroes and whites are better in Durham and the negroes more industrious , prosperous , and contented than I have known elsewhere . There is no negro problem in this community . It is quite certain that no other man who has lived in this State was so loved by the negroes . Hundreds of them viewed his face the last night on which his body lay in his Durham home , and thousands of them lined the streets as his body was carried to its last resting place . These qualities all go to show Mr. Duke a most remarkable and withal very wise man . In the eight years I have known him he has often reminded me of Abraham Lincoln . He had an unequalled sense of proportion and instinctive recognition of the eternal fitness of things , and intuitive knowledge of what is right  | and proper . And these make up the most useful gift vouchsafed to men on earth ? the gift of unerring wisdom ? wisdom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a full , harmonious character , and at its highest becomes a sort of moral instinct that almost compels a man to live his life wisely , just as the natural instinct compels the bird to sing its song . This unerring wisdom seems to me to have been the supreme gift of nature to Lincoln and likewise to Mr. Duke . The two were alike again in the sure command of a homely but shrewd humor ; both were brimful of that mirth which , according to Dr. Johnson , always measures the size of a man 's understanding . With this quiet strain of mirth ran a deep and persistent undertone of pity and tragic tenderness . The mystery " of all this unintelligible world " weighed heavily on both their minds . " The poor human race , " was a phrase often on Mr. Duke 's lips . This matchless humor and womanlike tenderness had their common origin in the naturalness and humanity of the man , in a heart that sought the widest good and loved the widest joy .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
