A CRITICAL journal of authority has pronounced the literary result of our Civil War unimportant and disappoint ing . And Mr. Stedman , in his very thorough review of American poetry , says : " The late Civil War was not of itself an incentive to good poetry and art , nor directly productive of them . Such disorders seldom are ; action is a substitute for the ideal , and the thinker 's or dreamer 's life seems ignoble and repugnant . " This same thought , of the superiority of life to art , of the deed to the word which records it , in every period of intense historical activity , ? in what Matthew Arnold has called an age of concentration as distinguished from an age of expansion , ? lute been always entertained by the thinker and the artist . " The end of man , " says Carlyle , " is an action , not a thought . " As a poet just beginning to win the ear of the public when the war broke out , Mn ' . Stedman himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Civil War was a general absorbent at the crisis when a second group of poets began to form . Their generation pledged itself to the most heroic struggle of the 750 Literature and the Civil War . century . The conflict not only checked the rise of a new school , but was followed by a time of languor in which the songs of Apollo seemed trivial to those who had listened to the shout of Mars . " I once expressed my surprise to the veteran poet , Mr. R. H. Stoddard , at the slight impression made upon the general public by Mrs. Stoddard 's novel , The Morgesons , published in 1862 . One seldom reads a novel twice . The Mo ? gesons is not an easily forgettable book , yet I had read it at least four times and at intervals of years . But I bad found few readers who knew it . Mr. Stoddard explained the fact by the date of its publication . The war monopolized attention so entirely that no mere fiction had a chance . The newspapers were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after being out of print for years , was reissued in 1888 , in a popular edition , and again this year . It has been publicly praised of late by Mr. Stedman as well as by Julian Hawthorne ; but it has never recovered from the unfavorable circumstances of its first publication , nor overtaken that belated recognition which it missed a quarter century before . It finds a new school of fiction in possession of the field . Indeed , in respect to fiction , the Civil War interposes a sort of crevasse between our earlier and our later literature . The spirit of the former age was lyrical , ? dithyrambic almost , ? and its expression was eloquence and poetry . The spirit of the present age is observant , social , dramatic , and its expression is the novel of real life , the short story , the dialect sketch . When Mr. James 's Passionate Pilgrim appeared , in 1870 , in the Atlantic Monthly , the signal seemed to be given for a newer and finer art in American fiction . Here was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensitive to the subtler shadings not only of character , but of manners and speech , and registering the most delicate impressions . A new style , too , studied in some points from Hawthorne 's , but less literary , more colloquial . The dialogue was not book talk , but the actual speech of men and women in society . No art can be more exquisite for its purposes than Hawtho ? ne 's . But the persons of his romances are psychological constructions types sometimes hardly removed from allegory ? engaged in working out some ? problem of the conscience in an ideal world . I-Es books are not novels in any proper sense . As to the novels , properly so called , of ante-bellum days , how faulty they now appear in details , when put in comparison with the nicer workmanship of modern schools ! Uncle Tom 's Cabin , ? how crude it is ! The Leather Stocking Tales , ? how tough in parts , and in parts how stilted ! Judd 's Margaret , ? how hopelessly imperfect as a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful book , but quite impossible as a novel . Winthrop 's Cecil Dreeme , ? poetic in conception , youthfully raw in execution . And yet all of these are works of undoubted talent . The Civil War , in fact , wound up one literary era and set the seal to it . Our literature has since developed along different lines . It would be unphilosophical to consider the writings produced during the four years of actual fighting , or those that have since been produced relating to the war itself , apart from the work of the thirty years of agitation which led up to the open outbreak of hostilities between North and South . The first series of Biglow Papers , the speeches of Sumner and Phillips , belong as truly to the literature of the Civil War as do Barbara Frietchie and the Gettysburg address . And this is recognized by Mr. Stedman when , to the passage already quoted , he adds this saving clause : " But we shall see that the moral and emotional conflicts preceding the war , and leading to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into expression , and buoyed with earnest and fervid Ben- timent our heroic verse . " And elsewhere , in writing of Whittier , he says : " He was . the singer of what was not an empty clay , and of a section whose movement became that of a nation , and whose purpose in the end was grandly consummated . We already see , and the future will see it more clearly , that no party ever did a vaster work than his party ; that he , like Hampden and Milton , is a character not produced in common times ; that no struggle was more momentous than that which produced our Civil War , no question ever affected the destinies of a great people more vitally than the antislavery issue as urged by its promoters . Neither Greece nor Rome , nor even England , the battleground of Anglo-Saxon liberty , has supplied a drama of more import than that in which the poets and other heroes of our Civil Reformation played their parts . " If this be true , is it also likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? caret sacro vote ? Here was a conflict involving not merely material interests , but high questions of right and wrong , fought by an educated people , a nation of readers and speakers , among whom literary talent is not uncommon . Is it to be expected that such a war will be barren of literary fruit ? Or do we not instinctively listen , as the hosts draw near , for some echo of that " Dorian mood Of flutes and soft recorders ; such as raised To height of noblest temper heroes old Arming to battle " ? Instead of seeking a direct answer to the question , let us for a moment strike into " the high priori road , " and inquire what additions to literature are to be reasonably anticipated from a civil war fought under modern conditions , and turning on such issues as negro slavery and the constitutional right of secession . Of war in general as literary material there is no need to speak . Fighting and love-making have furnished , between them , half the poetry of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever eradicate the gaudium cortrimiitis . It is the theme not only of the primitive epics , like the Iliad , the Nibelungenlied , the Chanson de Roland , but of the more modern and literary heroic poems which endeavor to reproduce the spirit of the ancient folk songs . It is the theme of the JEneid , the Orlando Furies ? , the Gerusalemme Liberata , the Faerie Queene . " Fierce wars and faithful loves , " announces Spenser , following upon Virgil 's " Arma virumque " and Ariosto 's " flame , gli amori . " Milton felt himself obliged to introduce a military element into his theological epic in battles between the hosts of Michael and Satan which do not altogether escape the grotesque . If Lowell 's saying is true , that the Odyssey is the only epic which is everywhere and always interesting , it is due to its exceptional character in this respect , and to the fact that the human mind does sometimes tire of fighting and desire something else . There is much killing in the Odyssey , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sea wandering and of strange adventures among strange peoples , so that the poem is in effect , as has been said , a romance . It is doubtful whether any modern war ? any later than the crusades , for example ? will lend itself to epic treatment . Certainly Tasso 's poem , which dealt with the capture of the holy city , Was not quite a success , and Voltaire 's Henriade was a flat failure . Perhaps the epic , as a literary species , is extinct , anyway , like the dodo and the mastodon . That legendary remoteness , that primitive and heroic state of manners , that anonymous character , that mixture of popular superstition , which distinguish the ancient epic and saga literature are no longer procurable . We know too much about modern wars . How can an epic be made out of a war in which we have tine military history of every campaign and battle , ? dispatches , bulletins , deleted material 754 Literature and the Civil War . Mr. Winston Churchill 's The Crisis , Mr. Owen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Cable 's The Cavalier . It is interesting to compare the first of these ? the best selling novel of the season ? with a book written so long ago as 1867 . Miss Ravenel 's Conversion , whose author was an officer in the Union army , is an honest , solid , old-fashioned story ; a little encumbered in its movement , but veraciously reflecting the confusion and uncertainty of the time , and the clash of opposing principles and passions . Major Do Forest was near to the events described , and was therefore under the necessity of being discreet . The time had not yet arrived for " historical portraits . " General Butler looms dimly in the background . Some incidents of the Red River campaign are worked into the plot . The action oscillates between New Orleans and New Haven , but the latter place is thinly disguised under the pseudonym of New Boston , in the state of Barataria . In The Crisis , on the other hand , the local color , which is laid on thick , is frankly of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman occur , in accordance with the Waverley formula for the construction of historical romance ; and the censorious reader who knows the slang of the sixties can please himself with detecting anachronisms like " nickel , " " sand , " and " What are you giving us ? " These are trifles , but possibly the laudator temporis acts who declines to accept them will also refuse his assent to the saliences of Mr. Churchill 's Lincoln and Mr. Churchill 's Sherman . To turn now from historical fiction to the distinct but kindred art of the historian , it is clearly too early for the final history of the war to be written , ? that great Thucydidean work which we may with all confidence predict , at once an impartial narrative of events , a philosophical exposition of causes and results , and a piece of literary art . The generation that fought the war has not yetpassed away , and every day it is record . ing its memories of the conflict . Beginnings have been made by writers like Greeley , Draper , Stephens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books are partial and premature , ? little more than MeMareS pour seroir . Meanwhile material grows fast : in compilations like the eleven volumes of Frank Moore 's Rebellion Record ; in serials like the Century 's Battles and Leaders of the Civil War ; in countless regimental histories , military biographies , journals , letters , and reminiscences , by statesmen , ambassadors , generals , private soldiers , refugees , hospital nurses ; by Cabinet ministers , Federal and Confederate , who disclose the secret diplomacies and policies of innermost government circles ; by women who reveal the domestic economies of households in besieged cities and on impoverished plantations . " The real war , " said Walt Whitman , " will never get in the books . " He meant , of course , that no dignified , formal history , dealing with things in their ensemble , will ever give a notion of the details of private suffering , individual sacrifice , personal heroism , which are known only to eyewitnesses and participants . For perhaps the best way to study history is in the documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Froissart , have a secure advantage in point of vividness . But surely the American war is not unfurnished of such . And many of the actors in , many of the observers of it , were skillful writers , able to turn their impressions into literature . I may instance , in passing , such papers as Theodore Winthrop 's Washington as a Camp , Colonel Higginson 's Army Life in a Black Regiment , Dr. Holmes 's My Hunt after " The Captain , " and Walt Whitman 's hurried but singularly picturesque jottings of camp and hospital life in Specimen Days and Democratic Vistas , particularly his description of the assassination of Lincoln . // As the war recedes farther into the past , we are enabled to see more clearly not only its political importance as a crisis in the history of popular government , but likewise its availability for poet , dramatist , and romancer . There were spectacular things in it , ? the spectacle , for example , of the liberation of a race from bondage . A crusading spirit animated the Union armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing the bells ring on the passage of the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery . " Again , what act upon the scene of history , what climax on the mimic stage , was ever more sublimely spectacular than the death of Lincoln ? " Memorable even beyond credit , " as Bacon said of the last fight of the Revenge , " and to the height of some heroical fable . " Not Charles on the scaffold , not Bonaparte on his island , not Henry under the dagger of Ravaillac , enacted such a hightragedy end . Such a tragedy it was that not even its histrionic surroundings , nor the cheap melodramatic posturing of the vain mime who was the paltry occasion of it , had power to vulgarize its dignity . If a dramatic poet had composed the war , could he have imagined a more effective close than history did , when she set the seal of death on the work of her protagonist in his hour of triumph , and consecrated him forever with the halo of martyrdom ? It would be strange if the poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his Commemoration Ode , has touched it nobly ; and Whitman , with a more intimate tenderness , in the only one of his poems which is really popular : ? But there is more to a war than fighting . In every great war certain leaders , civil and military , come forward on either side , certain imposing personalities , who embody and represent the ideals in conflict . Already these have emerged from the crowd , and our future poet or romancer will find them ready drawn to his hand . There is no need to attempt again the portrait of Lincoln . It has become a part of the national consciousness . But it is worth noticing that among the foremost contributors to the literature of the Civil War was the chief actor in it . The Gettysburg speech is now a classic , and is committed to memory by the children of our public schools . Hardly less classic are his numerous sayings , with their homely sagacity and their humor which endeared the President to a nation of humorists . Such phrases as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the people , " are not more familiar than the caution not to swap horses while crossing a stream ; or the maxim , " You can fool some of the people all the time , and all of the people some deleted material Literature and lar wars , in which old national enmities and the mere brute fighting instincts are unchained , ? like the Hundred Years ' War between England and France , and the last French and German war , ? these may be imposing by the scale of their operations or the generalship shown , but they have no message for the soul . They produce no precious and lasting literature . Surely pieces like Addison 's Campaign and Prior 's Ode on the Taking of Namur were a very paltry result of Marlborough 's brilliant victories . Southey 's little poem , The Battle of Blenheim , exposed the nothingness of it all . but it meant nothing , it settled nothing . All Alexander 's conquests left no such mark on literature as the defensive stand of the Greeks at Thermopylm and Marathon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries are not responsible for much poetry . Shakespeare 's Henry V. and Drayton 's spirited ode on the battle of Agincourt are the best that the English have to show for that business . On the other hand , consider how the one heroic figure of those wars , the Maid of Orleans , whom the old chronicle play of Henry VI . treats with such coarse brutality , ? consider how Joan of Are has inspired , and is to-day inspiring , the poet , the painter , the sculptor , the romancer , the historian . I never could believe that Shakespeare wrote Henry VI. , not only for other and critical reasons , but because , in spite of national prejudice , he never could have so missed a great dramatic opportunity . Truly patriotic wars , wars for freedom , for national defense , such as was that war of the French against the foreign invader ; such as was the Greek resistance to Persia ; such as was the German war of liberation in which Theodore Kerner fought and sung ; such as were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own Revolution and the wars // of the French Republic in its early days , when it stood on the defensive , and faced and beat Europe , ? these are the stuff of which literature is made . I have said that not all wars are poetic . Milton , who , like Heine , was a valiant soldier in the war for liberation , acknowledged this in his most martial sonnets . " he asks , and says again , " Peace bath her victories . " But Tennyson , in disgust at the frauds and corruptions of a stagnant peace ; would fain persuade us that bloodletting is in itself a purge for the diseases of a selfish , commercial society : it but with his cheating yardwand , home . " And so lie sends his young man in Maud off to the Crimea . Truly the charge at Balaldava was magnifique even though it was not la Tierce ; but what inspiration could the poet find in such a cause ? The Crimean war was not a crusade , a holy war ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle of material interests and political ambitions , ? what I have called a diplomatists ' war . Next to patriotic wars , wars for national independence or existence , those most fruitful in literature have been , in the wide sense of the word , Guitarloamy ? contests of religion or of opposed principles and ideas , such as the crusades , the long struggle between the Christians and Aloors in Spain , the wars of the Protestant Reformation all over Europe , the conflict of democracy with feudalism which centred in the French Revolution . And this is also true ? is especially true ? of civil wars . We find 758 Literature and a striking example of it in comparing the two great civil wars of English history : the York and Lancastrian feud of the fifteenth century , and the Great Rebellion ? as Clarendon calls it ? of the seventeenth . I call the former a feud , because it was , in fact , nothing but a gigantic family vendetta , no dynastic quarrel , in which no principle was at stake , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treacheries and cruelties : stranglings in prison , murders of captives , wholesale proscriptions and forfeitures . The nobility was decimated , but the people cared nothing about the cause of the strife . " A plague of both your houses " doubtless expresses the popular attitude . What has all this contributed to literature ? Practically a single figure , Shakespeare 's Richard III. , ? a dramatic creation rather than an historical verity , embodying in himself the craft and bloodthirstiness of a whole epoch of turbulent , meaningless confusion . Does any one ever read Daniel 's long poem , The Civil Wars ? Or Bosworth Field , by Sir John Beaumont , a cousin of the dramatist ? Wordsworth , indeed , borrowed a line from Beaumont in his Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle , though it was to celebrate , not the martial exploits of the Cliffords , but the peaceful virtues of that " good Lord Clifford " wino had been reared as a shepherd , and in whom , under the softening influences of nature , No , the wars of York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are " full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . " But because , by a lucky chance , the white and the red rose became the insignia of tine hostile houses , some po- the Civil War . etry has , in later times , attached itself , not to the dark struggle , but to its floral symbols ; and we have , for example , such a . ? lily in the mouth of Tartarus " as those famous stanzas on The White Rose sent by a Yorkist Lover to his Lancastrian Mistress . This is pretty , but ce nest pcts la guerre . Colonel Deming , of the 12th Connecticut , who was military mayor of New Orleans under General Butler , used to deliver a lecture on The Passage of the Forts . His regiment went up the river on the transports which followed in Farragut 's wake , and was quartered for a few days in Fort Phillips . The fort had been knocked to pieces by Porter 's shells . In a fragment of one of these , which had partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made its nest ; and Colonel Deming suggested the incident to our Hartford poetess , Mrs. Sigourney , as a good subject for a poem . Mrs. Sigourney might have done something with it ; or so might Longfellow , wino was not above dealing with the rather obviously emblematic . But this is not what I mean by the poetry of war . Take , now , by way of contrast to the Wars of the Roses , the English civil war of tine seventeenth century , and think of what it has given and is still giving to literature : half of the Waverley Novels , with the songs of the Cavaliers ? Lovelace , Suckling , Montrose ? and of modern poets who have continued the vein , ? Burns , Aytoun , Browning . This on tine side of Church and King ; and on the Parliament side Milton , ? a literature in himself , ? to say nothing of Puritan poets such as Marvell and Wither , books likd Lucy Hutchinson 's memoirs of her husband , and modern things like Victor lingo 's Cromwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human mind ? Not merely because of the po- Literature and litical importance of the constitutional questions at issue between the Stuarts and their Parliaments . Poetry does not easily attach itself to questions of prerogative and privilege , to petitions of right , exclusion bills , and acts of uniformity . It is because this was not a mere struggle of factions , but a war of conscience , which aroused all that is deepest in man 's nature . It was the shock of opposed ideals , ? ideals not only in government and religion , but in character , temperament , taste , social habit , and the conduct of life . Dumb are those names erewhile in battle load . " Yes , dumb are the names , but the things subsist . There are Roundheads and Cavaliers to-day : there is romn for them both in our now tolerant society , which allows a man to pursue his ideals in peace , but forbids him to impose them forcibly upon his neighbor . Now apply these tests to our own Civil War . Was it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dirty chimney , " or was it , as Carlyle came later to acknowledge , a crisis in the eternal warfare of right with wrong , of civilization with barbarism ? On each side was the grandeur of high convictions , and that emotional stress which finds its natural utterance in eloquence and song . To the South it appeared as a war of national defense , ? a war in resentment of interference with local rights and social conditions . And this was the constant cry of the Southern writers during the war : " Repel the invader . Clear the sacred soil of him . Let the North take its hands of us . Let it mind its own business . " On the Northern side the patriotic motive was the preservation of the Union ; and here the great speeches of Webster , the Reply to Hayne and the Seventh of March Speech , Memorized and declaimed by thousands of schoolboys throughout the North , became influential against secession , and belong properly to the literature of the war . // But what supplied the fire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformers . This underlay the constitutional question , just as the religious issue in the Cromwellian wars underlay the political issue . In each case the political issue was really subordinate . Charles would not have broken with Parliament if Laud had not tried to prelatize the Church and met resistance . South Carolina would not have seceded if she had not thought that slavery was threatened . In his addresses at Liverpool , Manchester , Glasgow , Mr. Beecher was always trying to convince the British public that the war for the Union was , at bottom , a war for the abolition of slavery ; and he was right . Hence the solemn fervor , the religious zeal , the moral indignation , of our war poets and war orators ; their appeal to God , their Biblical speech , their Hebrew spirit . Whittier 's Voices of Freedom and poems In War Time are like the sound of the trumpet blown before the walls of Jericho , or the words of the prophets denouncing woe upon Amalek . Here are the Roundheads again , then , under new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puritan strain once more . Once more here is the " good , old cause , " and the sword of the Lord and of Gideon , and we seem to hear Cromwell exclaiming , as the fog rose on the " armed mountains of Dunbar , " " Let God arise , and let his enemies be scattered ; like as the sun riseth , so shalt thou drive them away ! " This Hebraic temper and this Scriptural phrase are a constant note in the war poetry of the North . deleted material opens Mrs. Howe 's Battle Hymn of the Republic , set to the Hallelujah chorus of the John Brown marching song . My fellow townsman , Henry Howard Brownell , who was private secretary to Commodore Farragut , on whose flagship , the Hartford , he was present during sey- 760 The Lame Priest . oral great naval engagements , ? Henry Brownell , I say , was by no means a Puritanical not a theologically given person . He was , on the contrary , an easy-going gentleman , of liberal opinions and social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the old Free-Soil rage came upon Lint , he could be as apocalyptic in manner as Garrison or Whittier ? And it is curious to see how this same exalted utterance , this same Biblical language , is caught by a Southern poet , when he confesses that the future belongs to the North , and that the Northern sword was the sword of the Lord and of Gideon . I allude to the Confederate soldier Will Thompson 's High Tide at Gettysburg , one of the best poems of the war " God lives ! He forged the iron will That clutched and held that trembling hill . " In general , it is not unfair to say that the South was as badly overmatched at the lyre as at the sword . Timrod and Bayne may perhaps offset such poets as Brownell and Forneythe Willson and the author of The Blue and the Gray , but they tire no names to put against Whittier and Lowell . Certain passages in Low-ell 's Commemoration Ode are thus far the high-water mark of our war poetry , ? the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of the eighth strophe , and the passionate exordium : ? " A great literature , " says Walt Whitman , " will yet arise out of the era of those four years , those scenes ? era-compressing centuries of native passion , first-class pictAres , tempests of life and death ? an inexhaustible mine for the histories , drama , romance , and even philosophy of peoples to come ; indeed , the vertebra of poetry and art ( of personal character too ) for all future America , far more grand , in my opinion , to the bands capable of it , than Homer 's Siege of Troy , or the French wars to Shakespeare .
