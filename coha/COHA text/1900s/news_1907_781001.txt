txt After a bitter fight and a scathing denunciation of William R. Hearst and the proposed Parsons-Hearst alliance , the Republican County Convention early this morning nominated a joint RepublicanIndependence League ticket for all the county offices . These are the nominees : For Justice of the Supreme Court  --  M. LINN BRUCE . ( Rep. ) For Justices of General Sessions  --  CHARLES S. W.111.1 . MAN , ( Rep .. ) MELVLN G. PALLISER . ( L L. , ) NATHAN VIDAVER , ( L L. ) For Judges of the City Court  --  WILLIAM H. WADHAMS , ( Rep. , ) DOUGLAS MATHEWSON , ( Rep. , ) ISIDORE WASSERVOGEL , M41 ) .0 H. C. S. STIMSON , ( I. L. , ) JAMES A. DONEGAN , ( I. L. , ) EDSVLN S. MERRIL , ( L L. ) For Sheriff  --  MAX F. inMSEN . ( I. L. ) Opposition to Fusion . That the fusion with the Independence League will cost the Republicans many thousands of votes was the opinion expressed by many of the leaders who attended the convention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifteenth , Seventeenth , and other strongly Republican districts . In the Fifteenth District , where there is a bitter fight on between the followers of the present leader , Harry Mack , and the followers of ex-Senator Mazet , almost the whole delegation broke away from Mack and voted against fusion . It was the opinion of many of the delegates that Mack 's allegiance to leader Parsons will cost him his leadership . The apathy which has kept the registra.tion on the two first days at far below the ordinary figures  --  especialy In the strongly Republican districts  --  was sharply reflected in the convention . All the cheering and applause was perfunc-1 tory , and , if anything , the demonstrations that emanated from the minority at the denunciation of Mr. Hearst and the alliance were the most spirited . Leader Parsons himself seemed ill at ease at times , although by application of machine methods he had whipped the district leaders into line for his programme of fusion . In the nominations the Hearst people certainly had the lion 's share . Besides the rich Shrievalty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes with it , two places out of three on the General Sessions slate were given up to two of Mr. Hearst 's chief lieutenants , while the six places on the City Court bench were divided equally between the two organizations . Conference Committee Named . The attack on William R. Hearst and the proposed fusion began when President Parsons , after the roll of the delegates had been called and temporary organization had been effected , offered a resolution providing for the appointment of a committee of five to confer with a similar committee from the Independence League in reference to a joint ticket for county and judiciary offices . This was in accordance with the plan carried through by Leader Parsons at the meeting of the Executive Committee before the convention . Mr. Parsons made a speech in support of his resolution , in which he explained that inasmuch as there were no National or State issues involved , a. fusion with the Independence Leaguers , who differed widely with the Republicans on such questions , could do no harm . His speech was apologetic in tone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr. Parsons . " Only on rare occasions have we carried an election in this city , and then only by joining hands with other organizations . " Our inveterate foe has been and is now Tammany Hall , and in every election our aim has been to save the city by defeating Tammany Hall . Alone we can not do ' it . Shall we seek the co-operation of other organizations ? That is the question before us to-night " There is a peculiar responsibility resting on your Chairman and a peculiar responsibility resting on this convention . There are not only municipal offices to be voted for , but the principal question is whether men who are adorning the bench , Men who are most efficient and upright in the administration of their high offices , shall be continued in their useful and creditable work , . in the interest of . the community , and whether we should not do all in our power to assure their reelection . " Some applause followed the speech of Mr. Parsons , and then Senator Martin Saxe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District and led the , opposition , took the floor . Senator Saxe said : " I rise in opposition to this-resolution . Applause . In doing so I say that I fully realize the grave responsibility resting on I the shoulders of the County Chairman , and I further say that he can hardly realize that responisibility himself or he would not have moved this resolution . I " I want to say on the floor of this convention that the Republicans in the Fif- I teenth Assembly District , which gave Mr. Hughes the biggest vote in its history , are unanimously opposed to this fusion . We declare that we want no fusion with anything that bears the stamp of Hearst " In the last election we asked President Roosevelt that he interfere in this State to free us from Hearst . Mr. Roosevelt respondea quickly , and sent a high Cabinet officer , who in the City of Utica Made a speech in which , with the President 's authority , he denounced Mr. Hearst more than any other man run-ning for public office was ever denounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearst , and when we fuse with ; the league we fuse with the man whom the standard bearrer of our party in the Nation , our President , has openly denounced as an enemy to the best interests of this country and his State . There may be some Republicans who are faintdeleted 2 lines proud of the shameful pact we are about to make . " There is very little use to rise in opposition . The convention undoubtedly will support the County Chairman . But the Republicans in the banner district in this city are utterly opposed to fusion , and will remain so to the end as an object lesson to show that there still are some Republicans who remain faithful to the best traditions of their party . Denounces Hearst Alliance . " If we decide on this fusion to-night we will place ourselves and the Republican Party in this city in the sharrieful positionl of standing by the political wayside cry-1 trig out : ' A Hearst ! A Hearst ! My Kingdom for a Hearst ! ' " There was no mistaking the spontaneity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment behind it , though this sentiment was represented by a minority and the others had been whipped in line by Leader Parsons . Frank Moss , who had a seat among the delegation from the Thirtieth Assembly District , was the next speaker . He said he had really been the first man in the last campaign to make the assertion from a public platform that Mr. Hearst was responsible for the assassination of the late President McKinley . " The Fifteenth Assembly District , " said Mr. Moss , " shall not stand alone in its opposition to this resolution . The Thirtieth Assembly District will fall in line . Among the sturdy Republicans on the east side in Harlem I can find nothing but opposition to this proposed pact . That is in accord with my ( ) win feelings in the matter , too . " I am opposed to fusion for the sake of consistency , if for nothing else . In the last campaign we denounced Hearst and he denounced us . We denounced the alliance between Mr. Hearst and Mr. Murphy on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . We denounced both and won . " We then denounced Mr. Hearst not only as the greatest menace to the city , but to the State and the Nation . Now , to win a few offices of ' which we will think nothing ten years hence , we make an attack on the respectability of the Republican Party by making ourselves the tail of Hearst 's kite . For such sordid ends we are willing to bring disgrace on our party in the eyes of the whole city and the whole country by indorsing Hearst . " It is my opinion that an alliance between the Republican Party and Mr. Hearst 's Independence League will leave us far behind the Democrats when the , vote is counted . A. S. Gilbert , who comes from the Seventeenth Assembly District , the bailiwick of Col. Abe Gruber , spoke next , denouncing Mr. Hearst and the proposed fusion . Mr. Gilbert is a law partner of ex-Attorney General Julius M. Mayer . " Speaking for myself and others , " said Mr. Gilbert , " I want to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gang of Independents , who are out not for Independence but for jobs , and will do anything to get them . " Two years ago we had a municipal campaign . We went it alone and we went down to defeat , but we went down with honor . They come to us now , expecting us to keep them alive . We are to-day seeking to uphold the principles of President Roosevelt and Gov. , Hughes . Are we going to backslide on the eve of a Presidential and Gubernatorial year ? Are we going to keep alive these freebooters , headed by that man , Hearst ? " Give me a straight Republican ticket and certain defeat rather than a mongrel Hearst ticket and possible victory . Florence J. Sullivan , a delegate from the Twenty-third Assembly District , was the first man to speak in favor of fusion . He said in part : We owe Hearst a debt of gratitude . When he ran for Governor in this State we beat him by 50,000 votes . Let us hope that he will run for President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should we fear Hearst ? Can he kidnap us ? Need we lose our party fealty because we join hands with him to beat Tammany Hall ? " When a man gets up and says that he is in favor of our Chairman and then stabs him in the back I have a deep and abiding suspicion that time are causes which he dare not come out in the open and tell us about . The opponents of fusion have private grievances in their bosoms , and to gratify those they are willing to do injury to their party by driving it to defeat . " Gilchrist Stewart in the Thirteenth Assembly District , the negro real estate dealer who at the December meeting of the County Committee last year offered a resolution denouncing President Roosevelt as a result of his stand on the Brownsville incident , and who afterward started out ' to make an investigation of that affair on his own hook , spoke in favor of fusion , as did also Joseph Levenson , leader of the Second Assembly District . Senator Page was the principal speaker next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part : " I have not heard Mr. Hearst mentioned for political office in this election . If he had been so mentioned I would perhaps get as excited as some of those who have spoken here to-night . And I want to say that the men who voted in the Independence League column last year stood for something besides Mr. Hearst . They stood for better supervision of-public service corporations , and they stood for an administration of the law free from corporate influence . I do n't know . under the circumstances that we ! teed be ashamed of joining hands with them . I am sorry that Senator Saxe should be so utterly opposed to all alliances . I am curious to see if , when he runs for Mayor , he will object as sternly as he does tonight against getting outside support for the Republican ticket . %Abe Gruber Against Fusion . " This is a spectacle to make even the most hardened politician weep , " said Col. Abe Gruber . " I have always been opposed to fusion of any kind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is a combination of succotash and hash . Last year Mr. Hearst fused with Murphy . This year Murphy goes it alone , and we fuse with Hearst . indeed , politics makes strange bedfellows . " If our Chairman had asked my advice thirty days ago I should have said , ' Go it alone . Make your fight on . purely Repub-lican principles and on the record of Gov . Charles E. Hughes . ' It is on his policy we will he compelled to make our next fight Does Charles E. Hughes stand for anything that Hearst stands for ? " That the proposed fusion with the Independence League would become an assured fact became certain after the meeting of the Republican County Executive Committee , which preceded the convention . At this meeting Mr. Parsons , assisted by Senator Alfred R. Page and Congressman William M. Bennet , who have been Mr. Parson 's principaLadvisers in mapping out the programme , and who also have acted as intermediaries , carried through his Flan by a vote of 32 to 3 . The negative v tes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James E. March of the Third , and Frank Raymond of the Twenty-eighth . Harry Mack . the recognized Parsons leader of the Fifteenth Assembly District , voted with the County Chairman , but almost his entire delegation broke away from him at the convention and voted against fusion under the leadership of Senator Saxe , The convention was scheduled to meet at 8:30 , arid met , half an hour later . Thomas Whittle . Secretary of the County Committee , called the convention to order . William Halpin , Mr. Odell 's chief lieutenant in this city , was a delegate , but failed to put in an appearance , and was not represented by proxy . After the roll had been called , Charles K. Lexow , leader of the Sixteenth Assembly District . was chosen temporary and later under a unanimous resolution permanent Chairman . It was almost 11 o'clock before the fight over the fusion proposition was over , and the resolution of Mr. Parsons was carried by a viva voce vote . The Committee on Conference appointed by Chairman Lexow was composed of Mr. Parsons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charles S. Adler , a district leader from the lower east side . The convention , after appointing the committee , adjourned for an hour to provide time for the conference . The conferees hurried downstairs and got into a waiting automobile , which brought them to the Park Avenue Hotel , where they met the Independence League Conference Committee , - headed by Charles H. Gehring , % Chairman . of the Independence League ' County Committee . When the convention assembled again at midnight the slate agreed upon , at the conference and afterward nominated was brought before-the convention in the form of a reports- presented , by- Chairman Parsons. - All the " nominations:were ? made In a bunch , and adopted by a viva voce Vote . It was all over in ten minutes , whereupon the convention adjourned . sine die . HEARST 'S BOSSED CONVENT/ON . Wafts When Told and Accepts Its Rulers ' Candidates , From the time the ' Chairman 's gavel first fell until one of the speakers in nominating a candidate said he had been with the organization " from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , Independence League at Carnegie Lyceum last night was the most remarkable gath-ering of its kind this city has ever seen . The Democratic Convention , the night before , had been dominated by Murpny , but this dire was dominated by Clarence J. Shearn , who frankly confessed that he was chosen Chairman because ne was the only man in the organization who did not want a job . Thq meeting was called to order at 18:30 o'clock by Charles A. Gehring , who I immediately recognized Mr. Shearn . " When the Independence League adopted its platform at the State Convention , ' said Mr. Shearn , " it shook Murphy off its back . The opportunity rata now arrived for the County of New York to do likewise . " Then the speaker suggested that a committee of five be appointed to confer with " other bodies , " and the committee was named , a recess being taken for one hour . As Mr. Shearn and Mr. Gehring had both been named on the committee , it was fair to assume that they would leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining for the so-called judicial convention which followed the lead of the county convention , taking identically similar action . , Then Mr. Shearn , Mr. Gehring , and the other three committeemen went away . For the next three hours the delegates represented anything but independence . They represented idleness , somnolence , and even ennui . It was a case of suspended annimation . The convention was receiving absent treatment . The delegates lounged , smoked , talked , did every thing to kill time , and finally a goodly number of them went to sleep . When midnight approached they woke up , looked about , and went to sleep again , and it was not until within two minutes of this morning that Mr. Gehring appeared on the platform , the lounging delegates straightened up , those who had sought refreshers re-entered the hall , and the convention really came - to order . " Straightway Mr. Shearn reported for the Committee of Five that a joint ticket had been agreed upon . At this there was great cheering and the slate was announced . Mr. Shearn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common cause against the common enemy , Tammany Hall , and the County Committee , if it took his advice , would nominate for Sheriff Maximilian F. Ihmsen , whom he praised highly . The tired delegates took ' his advice , but insisted on the speechmaking , and went through the whole judicial programme , calling the judicial convention to order , and all the rest , until near on to 2 o'clock , when , with a final burst of cheers , the delegates left the hall . MURPHY PREDICTS . Tammany Ticket a Sure Winner , Says He , on Hearing the News . Tammany leader Charles F. Murphy predicted last night that the Tammany ticket would win despite the alliance between the Republicans and the Independence League . " Our ticket is a sure winner . I do n't care a snap what the Republicans and the Independence League do , " said the Tammany leader . THE DISTRICT CONVENTIONS . Nominations for Aldermen , Assemblymen , and City Judges . District conventions in various parts of the city last night made nominations for Aldermen , Assemblymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among those nominated for the Board of Aldermen . These were the results : deleted table MAYOR SILENT ON TICKET . He Will Endeavor to Furnish Money to Improve Central Park . Mayor McClellan refused yesterday to comment on the Tammany county ticket as chgsen at the convention on Wednesday night . He said he knew Peter Schumucke , named for Judge of the City Court , and that he had once been a candidate for City Magistrate . He seemed particularly anxious to learn whether or not the Republicans were going to fuse with the Independence League . The Mayor was asked about the request made by Commissioner of Parks Parsons for $2,000,000 with which to put Central Park in first-class order , and said that he would gladl give Mr. Parsons the money if he cTuld . He did not think that the appropriation of such a large sum could be managed at one time , but hinted plainly that he would do the best he could to get Mr. Parsons the money in installments.               @ @ @ @ @ @
