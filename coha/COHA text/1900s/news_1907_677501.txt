txt Felipe Randazzo , the butcher of 177 ChrYstie Street , who was shot through the heart on Saturday night , supposedly by agents of the " Black Hand , " was killed with a double-barreled shotgun of foreign manufacture , containing a cartridge brought from Italy . The police say further that the murdered man , like many other Italians in New York City , was engaged in business . but at the same time was a leader in the " Black Hand " er some similar organization . In his little butcher shop they found eesterday a dynamite cartridge of the sort recently *used in blowing up shops owned by prosperous Italians who have offended the organization . Therefore they believe he was a Member of a band of Italian Icriminals who ordered his death . Detective Sergeant Petrosino , in charge ' of the Italian Detective Bureau attached to the Central Office , had his entire force of sixteen Italian detectives on ' the case yesterday . They learned that he had made , enemies in the society to which he belonged , and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the police information which was likely to lead to the arrest of some of the band . Randazzo lived at 335 East 106th Street with a wife and child . Before he became acquainted with the men engaged in the Black Hand game he worked about New York as a plasterer . He had been in New York about three years , coming here from Palermo . Most of the men en , gaged in Black Hand blackmailing are natives of Sicily , from the Provinces of Palermo and Girgenti . Many of them have been sentenced to terms in prison for crimes they committed in Italy , but escaped paying the penalty . It is cusItomary in Italy to try a man on a criminal charge and convict him though he is not present at his trial . The Black Hand criminals here are mostly such men . Randazzo went into the butcher business ' in Chrystie Street about three months ago . It was his custom to close his shop about 9 o'clock every night except on Saturday , when he usually kept open later . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dtiseebTliiellttre Shop , and with a bundle of meat was about to go home , in Harlem 's Little Italy . lie had taken about three steps when he met his death . Some one undoubtedly standing in a doorway on the opposite side of the street had killed him , by shooting him through the heart . There were probably a hundred persons in the neighborhood at the time , but all they saw was a flash of fire on the opposite side of the street . They did not know what had happened until Salvatore Tuso , the proprietor of a delicatessen store next to Randazzo 's butcher shop , ran into the roadway shouting " Murder ! " He had seen Randazzo fall dead on the sidewalk . With the crowd came Policeman Natner of the Eldridge Street Station and made an investigation . None of those he questioned knew who el the shooting . Tuso said he had been eating his supper when he heard the report of a gun , and , running into the street , had seen the murdered man lying on the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eldridge Street Station , who came , bringing his detectives . After learning that the murderer had got away , the Captain broke open the door of the butcher shop and discovered a. dynamite cartridge in a tin pall behind the dead man 's counter . Going back to Radazzo 's body , Mannion saw that the . bullet , which had passed through his body , piercing the heart , was of large calibre . The Captain became satisfied that the bullet had not been fired from a revolver . The hole it had made was more than half an inch in diameter . An examination of Radazzo 's door showed that the bullet had passed through it , Just above the keyhole , and had hit the wall in the rear of the shop , bending a meat hook and rebounding . The bullet was found on the floor of the shop . Some or the people who were passing at rthe time were of the opinion that the murderer had fired the shot from a revolver on a street car , but the calibre convinced Capt . Mannion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a twelve gauge cartridge that did the work . At daybreak yesterday the shotgun was found In the yard of a tenement house at ( Rivington Street . Just around the corner . It was a gun made in Belgium , and in one of the barrels the police found an empty cartridge . The gun was almost five feet long ; the cartridge was more than two inches in length . An examination of the shell showed that it had-been made in Italy , It was evident to the police that both the gun and its cartridge were brOusht here from abroad . It wits also evident that the man who - had done the shooting was a crack shot . While the police did not say that Randazzo was a member of the Black Hand band that shot and killed Salvatore Sperlasto in the saloon where he tended bar , at 206 Forsyth Street , on Dec. n , they believe that the persons who killed him were members of the band who killed the Chrystie Street saloon keeper who was murdered in his home at First Avenue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shot with a gun and Italian cartridge similar to that used in this mut ' . dor . They also believe that the murderer wash a , , , member of the band which shot and , killed a grocer in Harlem 's " Little ! Italy , " and that the same gang was re , sPonelhla for many of the Black Hand , dynamite explosions of the last ' three months , including that in the grocery . stolne , at 334 Stanton Street on Saturday , ; ' Nov ' . 17 , and M Elizabeth Street soon after that . ? To the same agency they : attribute : the ' dynamite explosion in the at 502 First Avenue on ** When'aii ; At to-day 's meeting it was decided to ask every Italian in the city to attend the funeral of Cortez on Tuesday:morning next . It is expected that at least 5,000 of the 15,000 Italian residents will attend . attempt was made to kill a grocer named Viviano ; another dynamite explosion at 12 : : Mott Street on Dec. 16 , whtn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cono , and still another explosion at 2.51 Elizabeth Street , where an atterniot was made to kill Frank Barrlt , a grocer . The " Black Hand , " so Petroonio 's detectives say . has been responsible for more than sixty murders in New York recently . All of these were committed by men driven out of Italy and under there to terms in prison . While the police have their own suspicions as to the identity of the leaders of the gang they have scant hope of convicting them . No one will testify against them , and they do not themselves commit the crimes ordered by the organization . That . work is done by " grrenhorn3 , - men who have only been in this country 1 few months . A man in the Detective Bureau said last night that the " Black Hand " organiaztions were well financed , and he . expressed the opinion that it was impossible to put a stop to the crimes carried on by Flack Flanders here so long as this financial backing lasted .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
