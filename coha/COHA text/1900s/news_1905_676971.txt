FIGHTING FIERCE AND SAVAGE . The fighting in the streets was fierce and savage . The strikers and their sYni ? pathizers attacked the non-union men at every opportunity , assailing them with bricks , stones , clubs , kniyes , and any and every other offensive wi-apon that they could lay their hands on . In some instances men who had no connection with the strike were assulted by hoolums , who beat them first and later accused them of being strikebreakers . A notable instance of this kind was that of the Rev. W. K. Wheeler , pastor of the Ninth Presbyterian Church . who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on his way to , the Pennsylvania . - eStetetrie "  - -  at-  ; tacked by three men , who . knocked him down and beat him unmercifully until the arrival of the police saved hire from further injury .

The men knocked him down and kicked him about the head and face . He in turn knocked one of them down with a. billy , and the others ran . Thinking he had killed his assailant , Utley went to call an ambulance , but when it arrived the man had either recovered and gone away or had been carried off by his companions . The non-union men , although hopelessly outnumbered , fought desperately . In several instances they drew their revolvers and emptied them Into the crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threatening their lives . The colored drivers especially were quick with their weapons . Large numbers of non-union drivers carried heavy clubs , and they swung them with terrific effect . William Miles . a colored waiter , while at work in a lunch room at Adams and Sangamon Street 's , was a victim of the strikers ' fury , although he had had no connection whatever with the trouble . He was accused of being a strike breaker , and so badly beaten that he had to go to a hospital , where his injuries were pronounced severe . BATTLE ON A BRIDGE . One of the worst melees occurred this ' afternoon when Frank Curry , the strike breaker , was leading several hundred negroes armed with clubs and guns over Rush Street Bridge to the North Side . A union man rushed into the procession , and struck Curry two terrible blows in the face , closing one of his eyes entirely . Curry fired two shots , but the man es , caped . Then the battle began , and about twenty-five shots were fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded by a driver in a riot at Polk Street and California Avenue . This trouble was the result of an attempt by the ' Cuffed States Express Company to deliver goods on the far west side without police protection . - Maen the wagon was attacked by a mob the driver returned a volley of stones and other missiles with bullets from his revolver . Most of the riots to-night were small affairs , but heads were broken , and several arrests made . The most serious was when a crowd of 1,500 men and boys fought with a detail of fifty police . The riot started at Kingsbury and Erie Streets and ended at Halsted and Erie , a mile away , where a blockade composed of 150 teams and two street cars was broken . The riot followed the successful de , livery of four wagonloads of coal for a factory . When the wagons started south in Kingsbury Street from Huron Street thousands of men who had been liberated from work collected missiles of all descriptions and hurled them at the drivers and the escort of police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had their heads cut open by stones . Reinforcements of fifty policemen arrived in three patrol wagons and fought the crowd back . They got the teams as far as Erie Street and the St. Paul tracks , where the crew of a switching train blocked the street and transacted their business leisurely , giving the crowd an opportunity to renew the attack . Pickets were sent across the river to Halsted Street , and by the time the earthvan had escaped from theherowd , and crossed to the West side an immense blockade of teams on their way to the barns ? fer the night stopped them . In the middle of - the - blockade two ' electric cars had been stalled , and their passengers had fled . Here the rioters gave the police their hardest tussle . For nearly an hour they kept up a continued fire of stones . During one charge made by the police several Shots were fired by the strikers , which Were returned by a volley from the bluecoats . None of the shots took effect . Every pane of glass in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiley , John Lorch , and Thomas Keenan were rendered unconscious by blows on the head . Finally the blockade was broken by dint of hard work , the policemen in many cases unhitching horses and pushing wagons out of the way into side streets . The caravan then proceded , while a cordon of police stretched across the street and kept the crowd from following . During the fighting nearly a hundred persons stationed themselves on neighboring roofs and threw missiles into the struggling crowd . Twenty men supposed to be leaders were arrested . In another riot at Fulton and Union Streets , forty-five were arrested after many had been hurt . PICKETS MOLEST PURCHASERS . The cordons of union pickets stationed - on the curbing in State Street and Wabash Avenue were largely increased to-day greatly in numbers , with the result that , in spite of the vigilance of the police , carriages and hacks were stopped and drivers and their fares warned against attempting to carry purchases home from the boycotted stores . Store employes burdened with bundles were stopped and their parcels taken from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathizers to ' see if they were attempting to deliver goods to customers or carrying their own property to their homes . After assuring the pickets that the contents of the bundles belonged to them they were not disturbed further . In one instance a. hired carriage was stopped in Wabash Avenue , and the occupant , a v , - o- aan shopper , compelled to get out and walk . Another woman , with both arms full of bundles , was caught by the skirts and stopped as she was , about to step into a cab in State Street . ' The cab driver was warned not to take her as a fare . Undaunted , the shopper walked to another corner , where she hailed a seccnd cab . Again she was stopped by the union sympathizers . Finally she boarded a street car . The sidewalks and the surface and elevated cars were thronged with men , wo- ' men , and children carrying bundles of all sizes and descriptions . Although it was announced last night that the teams of the express companies and of the Employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing of the kind was attempted , save in the case of fifteen drivers employed by the Scott Transfer Company . None of these drivers was molested . Mayor Dunne and Chief of Police O'Neill made every effort to prevent the carrying of rifles , and Superintendent Reid of the Teaming Association informed them that he had not contemplated arming his men . TEAM OWNERS BALK . The Team Owners ' Association , which employs none but union teamsters , flatly refused  --  this afternoon to make deliveries to any of the firms involved in the strike when ordered to do so by the Employers ' Association . At the Union League Club this afternoon a meeting was held between members of the Employers ' Association and the large team owners . It was the desire of the members of the Employers ' Association to bring as much pressure to bear upon the team owners as possible , and with this view they had invited to the conference representatives ? f the railroads entering the city . The team owners stated their position exactly . They would not attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in progress for the reason that their own men would be called out and they would be involved in the trouble with which they considered they had no direct concern . They were informed that if they would not make deliveries their contracts with tire business houses . amounting to millions of dollars annually , would be eanceled. - Inds did not change their attitude , however , and they persisted in their refusal to take part in the strike . The railroad men , contrary to the hopes of the members of the Employers ' Association , did not exert the influence on the team owners that was expected . They took practically the same stand , declaring that the fight was something into which the railroads did not properly enter , that they had contracts with the team owners , that these contracts were at present being fulfilled to their satisfaction , and they could see no reason why the railroads should be dragged into the struggle . An exception to the general attitude of the Team Owners ' Association was made by the Central Supply Association , a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this company declared that they would make deliveries wherever their contracts called for them , irrespective of strike conditions . The Commission Team Owners and the Lake Transportation Team Owners ' Associations have taken a similar stand to the Chicago Team Owners ' Association . The attitude of the packers , which has been involved in some doubt , is now declared to be opposed to the extension of the strike to their teamsters . " Armour &; Co. have made no agreement whatever that would imperil the delivery of meat supplies . " said Manager Conors of that company to-day . " Our company is not a party to any agreement concerning deliveries , " said Edward Swift of Swift &; Co . TO SEE THE PRESIDENT , President Charles Dold of the Chicago Federation of Labor to-day appointed two committees , one to call on President Roosevelt and the other on Gov . Deneen and ask the two Executives not to order troops to Chicago without an investigation of the strike situation . The committee which is to make the request of the President is composed of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor ; Cornelius P. Shea , President International Brotherhood of Teamsters ; Thomas J. Rickert . President United Garment Workers of America : J. F. O'Neill of the Freight Handlers and member of the Chicago Federation of Labor , and T. P. Quinn , President of the Canvassers ' Union .
