SCENE : The stage is set to represent a deck built at the rear of a city house as an extension to its first floor . At the back , covering one-half the flat ( the right half ) is the dead wall of the next house . Vines grow on this wall . The left half at back is a high brick garden wall over which appear the ends and intervening light shafts of tall apartment houses . To the stage R. is the rear of the dwelling to which the deck is an addition . On the stage level two French windows let into the diningroom and one American windows in 3 looking into pantry . On the floor above , the octagonal bay of the library protrudes some feet over the stage . This bay is surmounted by a pretty balcony which lets into the sleeping apartment on the 4th floor . To the stage left , from the foot lights to the flat , an iron rail covered with foliage guards the deck from the back-yard supposed to be below except at the up-stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving upon a short flight of stairs to the garden level below . Tree wings are also L. and over the iron railings . The stage , representing a deck , is apparently slatted to let water through . ( The lines indicating opening should be drawn on the ground cloth up and down-stage in order to show . ) The center has a handsome rug on which is a round dining table six feet in diameter . A huge Japanese umbrella 8 feet in diameter is fixed on the middle of the table-top by a weighted foot , or standard . The table has on it the coffee cups , a champagne bottle , cigar lighter , cigars and cigaretes . A champagne cooler is to the left of the table and above the chair at that place . Six chairs are at the table . Time : The hour is eight of a June evening . The sun has set to the stage R. Its last rays still light the chimneys of the tall houses to the rear . Later the moonlight falls from the left  --  Lights show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WATERMAN , a New York business man of the " bluff and hearty " type , aged about forty-five . He sits to the left of the table . His guest , MR . FULTON , a Philadelphia millionaire , aged sixty-two , stands looking over the railing left . Both men have cigars half smoked  --  Both are in evening dress . MR . FULTON ( Turning and regarding stage ) Of course that shuts off the light a little from your kitchen . p. 3 HENRY ( Easily ) Some . But you see those joints are open  --  ( He indicates floor ) and besides  --  ( Smiling ) It is n't a good plan to turn too much light on that particular department . MR . FULTON ( Also smiling ) True . ( Fixes his glasses and looking left into yard ) You  --  Why you have n't had any oppressively hot weather in New York this spring have you ? HENRY No  --  why ? MR . FULTON Those mattresses  --  Thought somebody 'd been sleeping out of doors . ( Suddenly ) See here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY ( Heartily ) No indeed  --  your rooms are guest-rooms always . No ! Those two mattresses belong to the Reverend Cliff . MR . FULTON ( Rises ) Who ? HENRY The " Reverend Cliff " . MR . FULTON Oh . Dr. Bradford ? HENRY Yes , he wrestles on them . MR . FULTON Wrestles ? HENRY ( Nods ) Training for his constant clerical struggle with temptation . p. 4 MR . FULTON But really ? HENRY Oh . A matter of health . MR . FULTON Dr. Bradford actually practices wrestling ? HENRY ( Nodding yes ) And now and then the chap that 's training him gives Cliff a push with the gloves that makes him real glad those mattresses are there . MR . FULTON Boxes too ? HENRY Yes , indeed . If you ever go to the Reverend Doctor Bradford 's church and they pass you the contribution box , you want to settle . ( Smiles ) MR . FULTON ( Smiling ) Oh ! That 's what the Times meant by its allusions to muscular Christianity . HENRY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Cliff 's always gone in for athletics . This  --  this backyard business was my idea . Once or twice when I 've had a busy winter , too many dinners  --  too much of this . ( Touching bottle ) I 've gone up to Muldoon 's and got down to my proper weight again . MR . FULTON Muldoon 's ? HENRY Billy Muldoon  --  do n't know him ? Certainly you do . Held the world 's championship for wrestling  --  years and years  --  ( FULTON nods ) Retired unbeaten and opened a sanitarium up here in Westchester County . Well , when Cliff got all run down this winter  --  nerves and everything  --  you read about it  --  laughedright out at a funeral where he was the officiating clergyman  --   --  p. 5 MR . FULTON No ! HENRY Yes  --  But then that 's Cliff 's weak point . If it was n't for his sense of humor Cliff 'd be the banner clergyman of New York . Yes , sir  --  Well , as I tell you he " went back " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " HENRY Physically . MR . FULTON Yes , yes . HENRY That I advised him to go to Bill Muldoon 's . He did look it over but Billy said he 'd better not . Nice fellow Muldoon  --  gentleman 's instinctive feeling for the fitness of things  --  He did n't tell Cliff but he told me , you see , that a house full of race track chaps  --  and Wall Street men  --  and so on  --  Oh , he gets the best  --  He instinctively saw they 'd rub Cliff 's fur the wrong way ; so he sent a private instructor down here . MR . FULTON A masseur , I suppose . HENRY Ha , ha . Well , hardly  --  No , sir , a professional instructor  --  wrestling , boxing , anything . You know Cliff was quite a boy at College . Got a hatful of medals for it . MR . FULTON Indeed ? HENRY ( Nodding ) Runs in the family . Mattie 's just like him  --  hard as a base ball . p. 6 MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . FULTON Oh , your wife ? HENRY Yes  --  Golf  --  swim  --  take a five bar gate on her hunter ! See her in the box at the opera you 'd simply say " trim , well groomed woman " , but  --   --  ( Closing fist ) got an arm like a stocking full of green apples  --  ( Smoking ) MR . FULTON ( Regarding the back yard ) And Dr. Bradford takes his exercise there ? HENRY Two half hours every day . MR . FULTON ( Looking about ) And the neighbors ? HENRY Ca n't see him  --  Some Japanese screens there  --  Pull over  --  make an awning ; notice ? MR . FULTON I see ; and the newspaper people object to that , do they ? HENRY Only the Times . It was one of their proprietors that Cliff was burying at the funeral . Cliff was saying all the nice things he could about him  --   --  MR . FULTON Naturally  --   --  p. 7 HENRY  --  man was dead  --  and anyway Cliff 's an awfully liberal minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand when he happened to catch the eye of one of the reporters that had been sent up to " do " the funeral  --  Well ; the young fellow half smiled and kind o ' shut one eye that way  --  ( Winks ; and then with explosive vigor dramatizing the clergyman 's predicament he throws up both hands ) Well , think of it  --  and Cliff 's sense of humor ! He made a struggle of course and he 'd have pulled through if this little reporter 'd only gone out  --  but there he was with a half strangled grin , getting more infectious every minute  --  Well ! ! Dr. Bradford covered his face with his handkerchief and tried to pass the business off for tears , but dear me  --  you read about it ; the assistant had to finish and Cliff pretended to be ill and all that ; but naturally the Times never forgave him for it . We stood their criticisms of that affair but when they began assailing Cliff 's private character why , we sued them for libel . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see that . HENRY Did n't your daughter write you about it ? MR . FULTON No. p. 8 HENRY Happened since she 's been here . MR . FULTON ( Anxiously ) It 's nothing about Catherine herself ? HENRY Oh , dear no . MR . FULTON You 're quite sure . HENRY Perfectly . MR . FULTON Any woman involved ? HENRY Oh , not that way  --  Well here  --  I 'll read it to you . ( Calls to library ) Mattie  --  James  --  Oh , that you , Mattie ? MRS . WATERMAN ( In library ) Yes , it 's I. HENRY Wo n't you hand me the scrap book from the big table there with Cliff 's notice in it . MR . FULTON Is Mrs. Waterman not sensitive about it ? HENRY Not a bit . MRS . WATERMAN ( Appearing in window , 2nd story ) Here you are . ( Handing book ) Is there anybody that has n't read that interesting publication ? HENRY Mr. Fulton has n't . Tell Cliff to come down here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 MR . FULTON I 'm not detaining you ? HENRY Oh , no . ( With book ) Here we are  --  Under religious notes mind you . ( Reads ) " The Reverend Clifton Bradford is taking a more muscular and , if possible , a more humorous view of life during these days , than even that which he formerly enjoyed . He had as companions to a sufficiently jolly little dinner last week , Kid Garvey , the champion middle weight prize-fighter and Miss Myrtle Morrison , the leading serio comic and short skirt dancer from the Pleasure Palace "  --  Whole cloth , mind you  --  whole cloth . MR . FULTON But how dare they ? Here comes Dr. Bradford himself . ( Tries to hide book ) HENRY Oh , Cliff does n't care . ( Enter BRADFORD from the house . ) BRADFORD ( Referring to book ) Sufficiently piquant , eh ? MR . FULTON But why ? BRADFORD Oh  --  an old enmity . HENRY I 've told him about that . BRADFORD We 've ignored the preceding publication . HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . HENRY ( To FULTON ) And it 's always been a question before as to whether the stuff was libellous or not . You see they gave a humorous slant to everything . MR . FULTON Oh , I know them . HENRY ( Closing the book ) And that 's such an easy thing to do if you 've got a clergyman for your target . MR . FULTON Yes , yes . HENRY Our lawyer 's Newton Bates . MR . FULTON ( In admiration ) Newton Bates ? HENRY Wo n't he make ' em squirm ? MR . FULTON Ah . HENRY You know they wanted him on the Beecher trial only the other counsel thought him too young at that time . BRADFORD Member of my congregation . MR . FULTON ( In appreciation ) ' m . BRADFORD ( To HENRY ) Judge Bates says that 's actionable ? ( Indicates book ) HENRY Unquestionably . p. 11 MR . FULTON No ground for it at all ? BRADFORD ( At rail ) None  --  except that I 'm doing a little gymnastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FULTON And your instructor 's not a prize fighter ? BRADFORD AND HENRY ( Both exclaim ) Oh ! BRADFORD ( Shaking his head ) A mere boy  --  named Sheldon  --  charming manners  --  not an educated man to be sure  --  that is , not a college man , but  --   --  MR . FULTON To be sure  --   --  HENRY ( Emphatically ) But he knows his business . BRADFORD ( With laugh ) Ha ! HENRY ( With more enthusiasm to FULTON ) Why , I thought Dr. Bradford was falling down as a joke  --  This Sheldon  --  mere boy you understand  --  does n't seem to hit him any harder than that  --  ( Taps FULTON 'S arm ) Looks like a kitten playing with the darning cotton . BRADFORD Feels different however . p. 12 HENRY Cliff had him tap me just for fun , on the shoulder  --  now I 'm not an invalid , am I ? MR . FULTON ( Smiling ) I should n't call you one . HENRY Well , he did that  --  ( Business of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window  --  she thought he was brushing a speck of dust off my waistcoat . I stumbled clear across that furthest mattress ; and if that back fence had n't been there , I 'd have gone through to Madison avenue  --  Mattie thought I was " being funny " for the girls , but that night I showed her a green and blue patch there about the size of an alarm clock . MR . FULTON Man must be a Hercules . BRADFORD Quite the contrary . HENRY Does n't strip noticeably big . ( Enter CATHERINE from house . ) CATHERINE You ready , father ? MR . FULTON Is it time ? CATHERINE Almost . MR . FULTON I shall be  --  excuse me . ( Exit to house ) ( Telephone bell off. ) p. 13 BRADFORD Beautiful evening for your concertparty , Miss Catherine . CATHERINE Oh , it is n't my party . BRADFORD No ? CATHERINE ( Shaking her head ) It 's Mr. Lumley 's . ( She puts on gloves ) HENRY You must see the difference Doctor  --  Lumley 's party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my profession always has been its impulse to prophecy . CATHERINE ( Stupidly ) What 's he talking about , Mr. Waterman ? HENRY About you and Lumley . These minister fellows , Catherine , watch the society columns like your father and I watch the markets . Their incomes depend on social futures . CATHERINE Oh , I do n't know anything about business . HENRY Well , you wo n't have to if you marry Lumley . CATHERINE It is n't at all certain that I shall marry Mr. Lumley . HENRY Is n't it ? CATHERINE No  --  I may not marry anybody . ( Enter JAMES , a butler. ) p. 14 JAMES Pardon , sir . There 's a call at the telephone . HENRY Me ? JAMES ( Clearing table ) Yes , sir . HENRY Excuse me . ( Exit to house ) BRADFORD I was going to ask you to excuse me from the concert this evening Miss Catherine but if the party 's entirely Mr. Lumley 's I 'll ask him . ( Exit JAMES with coffee cups and napkins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some writing that I should n't neglect any longer and besides that , Mr. Sheldon 's coming to get his things this evening . CATHERINE ( Interested and surprised ) Mr. Sheldon ? BRADFORD Yes . CATHERINE His things ? Why ? BRADFORD He 's through with me for the present  --  I 've graduated . CATHERINE And he 's not coming any more  --  at all . ( Enter JAMES . ) BRADFORD No  --  ( At steps ) James ! p. 15 JAMES ( Going to BRADFORD ) Yes , sir . BRADFORD Mr. Sheldon 's coming to take the gloves and shoes and some other things that belong to him . I 'll show you which ones they are and you can help him do them up . JAMES ( Sulkily ) Yes , sir . BRADFORD ( To CATERINE ) You 'll excuse me a moment . CATHERINE Certainly . BRADFORD ( Going down steps ) And to-morrow these mattresses can be put in the trunk room . JAMES ( Following , with disapproval ) Yes , sir . CATHERINE ( Alone ) He 's not coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balcony ) Shall we need opera glasses , Catherine  --  what do you think ? CATHERINE I 'm not going . ESTELLE Not going  --  why ? CATHERINE I 've changed my mind . ESTELLE Why ? CATHERINE ( Quick glance to garden ) I 'll tell you later . ( Enter MRS . MATTIE WATERMAN from house . She is the athletic New York woman of thirty-three. ) p. 16 MRS . WATERMAN Oh . All alone , Catherine ? CATHERINE Dr. Bradford has just left me . MRS . WATERMAN My ! what a pretty gown my dear . CATHERINE You like it ? MRS . WATERMAN Who would n't like it ? Now do n't tell me that was made in Philadelphia , too . CATHERINE Yes , it was . MRS . WATERMAN Well , you certainly have found a treasure in that woman . ESTELLE Do you think so , Mrs. Waterman ? MRS . WATERMAN ( Looking up to balcony ) Oh , you there  --  Estelle ? Why of course I think so . I never saw anything like it . I 've two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for it this minute if it would fit me . You must carry a long wrap with that , my dear . You know the concert 's on the roof and the chairs are bound to have some dust on them  --  soot or something . CATHERINE You might bring my gray cloak , Estelle . ESTELLE You 'll go , then ? Good . ( Exit ) MRS . WATERMAN What does she mean , Catherine ? Did you think of not going ? p. 17 CATHERINE I 'm not sure that I shall . MRS . WATERMAN You 're not ill , Catherine dear . CATHERINE Oh , half  --  no , it is n't that  --  but I just ca n't go to-night . MRS . WATERMAN ( Anxiously ) My dear ! What is it ? ( CATHERINE shakes her head ) You must tell me , my dear . CATHERINE Since my engagement 's been published , I 've felt half dazed all the time . MRS . WATERMAN ( Comfortingly ) And quite excusably , my dear Catherine ; Reggy Lumley 's the catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it . I do n't want to be rushed , in this way . MRS . WATERMAN Rushed  --  Why there 's no day set is there ? CATHERINE No  --  but  --  the man himself  --  Why do n't you tell me what to do ? MRS . WATERMAN Why , I will , of course . What is it ? CATHERINE If I really loved him , I 'd want to see him this evening , would n't I ? and I do n't . MRS . WATERMAN You do n't ? p. 18 CATHERINE No  --  I do n't . My hands are so cold at the thought , that my gloves do n't fit me . MRS . WATERMAN Why , you strange creature  --  and when you were here in October , you could scarcely wait until the evening for him to call . CATHERINE I know it and I liked him in Philadelphia too . MRS . WATERMAN Well , of course , that does n't mean so much  --  and now ? CATHERINE ( Explaining and extending her limp arms ) This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcement that has caused the change in you , my dear ? CATHERINE Oh , no , it 's more than that . MRS . WATERMAN ( with match-making eagerness ) Catherine !  --  you 've met some one else  --  ( CATHERINE turns away ) My dear Catherine ! ( Puts arm about her ) Tell me . ( CATHERINE shakes her head ) But , my dear , you have n't seen anybody else . Besides poor Lumley you have n't seen anybody but in this house . ( CATHERINE covers her face ) Catherine ! It ca n't be that  --   --  p. 19 CATHERINE ( Impulsively ) Oh , do n't ask me  --  MRS . WATERMAN I wo n't  --  I wo n't  --  not a word , my dear . ( Pause ) Does Estelle know ? ( Looks up at balcony  --  CATHERINE nods ) What does she say ? ( CATHERINE shakes her head ) Does n't approve , eh ? ( CATHERINE shakes her head ) ' m  --  Well , my dear , your aunt Mattie  --   --  CATHERINE Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , dear , not a word . ( Pause ) He 's nice of course . ( CATHERINE nods ) Money ? ( CATHERINE shakes her head ) Business man ? ( CATHERINE shakes her head ) Professional ? ( CATHERINE nods . MRS . WATERMAN embraces her protectingly ) Well , if you love him , my dear , a professional man makes a very good husband  --  that is if  --  ( Pause ) He 's not a lawyer ? ( CATHERINE shakes her head ) Not a physician ? ( CATHERINE shakes her head ) Not a  --   --  CATHERINE Oh , please do n't ask me. p. 20 MRS . WATERMAN Not a word , my dear  --  not a word . There  --  there  --  ( Pause ) Well , if he has n't money I hope he has youth and health . ( CATHERINE nods ) He 's a good physical specimen ? ( CATHERINE nods ) Good ! Good  --  ( Pause ) But , dear me , it 's going to be a trifle hard on Reggie Lumley ,  --  though Reggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what shall I do ? MRS . WATERMAN You 're quite sure you love him ? CATHERINE Yes . MRS . WATERMAN Has he proposed to you ? CATHERINE Oh , no . MRS . WATERMAN Of course he has n't  --  ( Pause ) Do ? Well , the first thing to do my dear , is to make him propose . CATHERINE But my father wo n't like it at all  --  he wo n't like the man 's profession , and he wo n't like his being poor . MRS . WATERMAN ( With some hauteur ) ' m . The gentleman 's profession supports him , does n't it ? CATHERINE Oh , yes . p. 21 MRS . WATERMAN And it improves others ? CATHERINE Oh , yes . MRS . WATERMAN Well , let me tell you , my dear , that this getting married is a very personal thing ; and if you love the man and you do n't love Reggie Lumley at all  --   --  CATHERINE But I 'm not sure of that . I think I love Mr. Lumley too  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Waterman ? MRS . WATERMAN ( A trifle behind the times ) Well , my dear . ( Pauses ) Hardly in the same way . CATHERINE Not in the same way at all . I 'm proud of Mr. Lumley , and I feel so  --  so safe and protected and respectable when he 's with me . But the other one makes me almost forget Mr. Lumley . I 'm not myself , I feel like running away from people and hiding myself . I feel as though someone should scold me very hard for something I have n't done at all . I feel rebellious and lawless and not like myself . Why sometimes I almost want to strike Estelle . MRS . WATERMAN Strike Estelle . You mean when she opposes you in this new affection ? CATHERINE Yes . ( Enter BRADFORD. ) p. 22 BRADFORD I 've asked Miss Catherine to excuse me to-night . I shall have to miss the concert and  --  CATHERINE I 'm not going either . ( Mrs. WATERMAN pleased . ) BRADFORD Oh , you 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine is n't feeling quite herself to-night and we 've decided between us that the concert would bore her . BRADFORD Oh  --   --  CATHERINE Do you mind , Mrs. Waterman , if I pick one of those roses ? ( In garden L. ) MRS . WATERMAN Take as many as you like , my dear . CATHERINE Thank you . ( Goes down steps L. MRS . WATERMAN nods to BRADFORD to look at CATHERINE , he does so and looks back inquiringly ) MRS . WATERMAN Pretty ? BRADFORD Very . MRS . WATERMAN She 's about as stylish a girl as we know , Cliff , dear . BRADFORD Yes , I think she is . MRS . WATERMAN Everything looks well on her . There 's an old fright of a gown done in Philadelphia and she makes it look as if it had been made in Paris . p. 23 BRADFORD A very misleading young woman , altogether . MRS . WATERMAN Misleading ? ( BRADFORD nods ) What do you mean by that ? BRADFORD She looks wise enough to give Greek lessons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll . MRS . WATERMAN Why , Cliff , you 're mistaken . BRADFORD ( Amused ) Am I , Mattie ? MRS . WATERMAN You 're very much mistaken . I 've seen a pincushion that she painted just as handsome as anything in the shops . BRADFORD Really ? MRS . WATERMAN And I 'm sure she plays very well and while she does n't talk glibly at all , all the men , every one of them , are crazy about her , I 'm sure , just crazy . BRADFORD She seems fairly popular when her friend Miss Kitteridge is with her . MRS . WATERMAN They make a very good contrast . BRADFORD Very . MRS . WATERMAN Estelle  --  ( Looks cautiously at window ) Estelle 's as plain as a mud fence and Catherine 's a howling beauty . p. 24 BRADFORD Yes ? MRS . WATERMAN ( Getting annoyed ) Yes , and you 're very much mistaken , Cliff dear , if you think the men are attracted by Estelle  --  they come to see Catherine . BRADFORD They come to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain to talk with Miss Kitteridge . MRS . WATERMAN Oh , you over-estimate the value of talk  --  all ministers do . BRADFORD So I begin to fear . MRS . WATERMAN A man does n't marry a woman because she can talk . Men frequently quit them for it . No indeed  --  a man wants a wife that 's stylish and looks well  --  one who  --  as Henry would say  --  who " can make a front " . I 'm sorry to see you so interested in the Kitteridge girl , Cliff . She 's only a companion , you know . It would n't surprise me if she got a salary . BRADFORD My profession , Mattie , has no deepseated prejudice against salary . MRS . WATERMAN So I 've observed ; but her salary would stop if she got married and her ability to talk might even increase . BRADFORD It would naturally grow with her information . p. 25 MRS . WATERMAN So would Catherine 's and it might turn out that even Catherine 'd talk all you wanted her to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of us has dreamed of  --  and she 's certainly very bright at times . BRADFORD Indeed  --  I 've failed to notice that . MRS . WATERMAN There are many things , my dear brother , that you fail to notice . BRADFORD True . MRS . WATERMAN For one thing you fail to notice that the poor girl 's dead in love with you . BRADFORD ( Astonished and annoyed ) What ? MRS . WATERMAN Sh  --  yes , you  --  I mean it . You 've driven her almost frantic with it . BRADFORD Miss Fulton ? MRS . WATERMAN Yes . BRADFORD Ridiculous , why she 's engaged to marry Reginald Lumley . MRS . WATERMAN That 's a mere bit of finesse . BRADFORD A bit of what ? MRS . WATERMAN Finesse  --  she 's trying to pique you into saying something yourself . p. 26 BRADFORD ( Warningly ) Now see here , Mattie  --  I said the poor girl did n't know anything , but do n't tell me she 's immoral . MRS . WATERMAN Cliff dear  --  you ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't call things such dreadful names . Immoral is a word we apply to a lady after the court decides that she deserves it and gives the divorce to the husband . A simple engagement  --  in fact the very first engagement ; and as pretty a girl as Catherine is mere vivacity . Now I wo n't talk to you , Cliff  --  I wo n't . BRADFORD I should n't Mattie , if I were you . It strikes me the burden of responsibility is in the other direction . MRS . WATERMAN Never mind . The girl loves you  --  she 's got money and you have n't even a certainty in your profession . BRADFORD No ? MRS . WATERMAN No  --  with your ability to get amusement out of the burial service . BRADFORD Now , see here , Mattie . We both know all about that . I have unfortunately laughed at critical moments when it would have been more generally agreeable to have remained serious . I admit it  --  but my vestry understood the conditions very well . They recognize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not at any virtue or at any laudable endeavor . It seems somewhat incongruous that I should retain their confidence and that my own sister  --   --  p. 27 MRS . WATERMAN ( Going to him ) Why , Cliff , it is n't you . It 's your profession . Some ministers are born for it . They 'd rather be good  --  but you 're a man who could enjoy life if you had money . BRADFORD My dear Mattie !  --   --  MRS . WATERMAN No , listen to me , Cliff . We both know that your profession 's a great struggle . Now here 's the richest girl in Philadelphia . I 've suspected it all along  --  when you 're boxing or wrestling out there she 's at the window  --   --  BRADFORD No  --  no  --  no  --  why Mattie , I could n't marry a woman I did n't love , even if  --   --  MRS . WATERMAN But Cliff , dear , you have n't tried  --   --  BRADFORD And I do n't mean to try  --  I 'm not striving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm working the hardest I know how to stay in it . And if I can marry , the woman will be one of character and  --   --  MRS . WATERMAN ( Mocking ) And piety . BRADFORD I sha n't insist on that  --  but I shall hope for some intelligence and spirituality . ( Enter HENRY and LUMLEY . LUMLEY is a young man of more money than brains. ) p. 28 HENRY Mr. Lumley , my dear . LUMLEY ( Following ) I came a trifle early because  --   --  . ( JAMES re-enters by steps L. and removes umbrella from table  --  closing it . ) MRS . WATERMAN ( Taking LUMLEY 'S hand ) That was very proper , I 'm sure . BRADFORD Good-evening ; we were just discussing you , Mr. Lumley . LUMLEY ( To MRS . WATERMAN ) Pleasantly , I hope . MRS . WATERMAN ( Smiling ) Oh , yes . BRADFORD ( Insinuatingly ) My sister was planning a little surprise for you . ( JAMES removes table cloth and blanket pad . ) LUMLEY Oh , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . WATERMAN ( Warningly ) Cliff ! ( Exit JAMES to house . ) LUMLEY At least tell me what it 's about . A surprise is so much more enjoyable if one knows what its about .

( Indicates stairs ) p. 29 MRS . WATERMAN Why , of course . LUMLEY Thank you . ( Exit by stairs ) HENRY What surprise ? BRADFORD Why Mattie advises me to  --   --  MRS . WATERMAN ( Interrupting and looking quickly toward garden ) Cliff ? ( To HENRY ) Nothing at all . HENRY Oh  --  ( Turns away to rail ) BRADFORD Ca n't we tell Henry ? MRS . WATERMAN I 'll tell him myself some other time . HENRY Handsome couple are n't they ? MRS . WATERMAN Very  --  But do n't stare at them , Henry . Ca n't you see there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MRS . WATERMAN Yes  --  Some little disagreement probably . BRADFORD ( Smiling and nodding toward yard ) Best place in the world for an argument . HENRY Two mattresses  --  yes  --  ha , ha ! p. 30 MRS . WATERMAN ( Chiding ) Henry ! HENRY ( In mock obedience ) What is it , Mattie ? MRS . WATERMAN They 'll think you 're laughing at them . HENRY Well  --  I am . ( Enter ESTELLE from house with cloak for CATHERINE . ) ESTELLE Everybody ready ? MRS . WATERMAN I think so . ESTELLE Did n't I hear Mr. Lumley 's voice ? BRADFORD ( Indicating garden ) In the garden . ESTELLE ( Seeing ) Oh . HENRY But you must n't look at them . ESTELLE No ? MRS . WATERMAN Catherine is n't going to the concert , and she 's telling him so . ESTELLE ( To MRS . WATERMAN ) Why not  --  Has she told you ? BRADFORD ( With back to rail ) Its a little surprise we 're arranging for Reggie  --  ( Nods off ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( To ESTELLE ) But the rest of us will go , of course  --  I 'm really sorry for Reggie , but then  --   --  BRADFORD But then finesse is finesse  --  is n't it , Mattie ? HENRY ( Moving from rail ) Time ! MRS . WATERMAN ( To HENRY ) What is it ? HENRY First round 's over  --  they 're coming . ( Nonchalantly tries empty bottle ) MRS . WATERMAN ( Turning with society manner ) Oh !  --  Did you find some pretty ones ? ( Goes to rail . HENRY winks to BRADFORD ) CATHERINE ( Off ) All these  --  You wo n't scold me , will you ? MRS . WATERMAN Not this time , my dear . ( BRADFORD goes to ESTELLE R. ) ESTELLE Is the finesse Catherine 's or your sister 's ? BRADFORD You know of it ? ( Enter CATHERINE followed by LUMLEY. ) p. 32 ESTELLE ( Shaking head ) Only what you just said  --  but of course the ministry would n't use finesse , and Wall Street  --  ( Nodding toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be finesse by one of the ladies . BRADFORD But you think either Wall Street or the Ministry might prove susceptible to it . ESTELLE Both ! LUMLEY ( At top of steps ) It 's too bad , is n't it , that Miss Catherine is n't feeling well ? HENRY ( With surprise ) Not feeling well ? ( CATHERINE shakes her head and looks at ESTELLE who has a glance of enquiry . ) LUMLEY But she heroically insists that the rest of us shall go to the concert . CATHERINE ( Demurely ) I sha n't mind being alone at all . MRS . WATERMAN Oh , you wo n't be alone , my dear  --  all the servants here , and Doctor Bradford 's staying in  --   --  LUMLEY ( Disappointed ) Oh ! Doctor Bradford ca n't go either ? BRADFORD ( To MRS . WATERMAN ) Yes , I 've decided to go . ( CATHERINE half smiles , biting her under lip in restraint. ) p. 33 MRS . WATERMAN ( With disapproving surprise ) Oh  --  you have ? ( BRADFORD nods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be a trifle late however , Doctor . BRADFORD Will it ? HENRY ( Nods off ) My telephone was Judge Bates  --  he 's coming over to see you . BRADFORD Oh  --  ( To LUMLEY ) Then I shall be late of course . LUMLEY ( Getting his tickets ) Oh  --  ( Pause ) Well , I 'll leave you a coupon anyway and give your name to the man at the door . MRS . WATERMAN You might leave two . Catherine may feel better after a while . CATHERINE No , I 'm sure I sha' n't . ( LUMLEY gives two coupons to BRADFORD . Enter FULTON . ) MR . FULTON I hope I have n't kept you waiting . Good-evening , Reginald . LUMLEY Good-evening . Too bad Catherine is n't feeling well . MR . FULTON ( Anxious ) Why , my dear  --   --  p. 34 CATHERINE It 's nothing , father . I 'm sure I shall be all right as soon as you 've gone and I lie down a few minutes . MR . FULTON I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must n't . I want you to hear the concert  --  I want you all to hear it . ( Exit to house . ) MR . FULTON ( Follows ) My dear Catherine  --   --  LUMLEY We can postpone it of course , Mrs. Waterman . MRS . WATERMAN We should only lose our evening ; all of us . Catherine wishes to be alone , you see . ( Exit ) LUMLEY Oh . ( Follows ) ESTELLE Do the " finesse " and the " surprise " relate to the same subject ? BRADFORD I believe they do . ESTELLE Mrs. Waterman evidently approved ? BRADFORD ( With a look to HENRY ) So it seems . ESTELLE ( With some perplexity ) Oh  --  ( Exit ) p. 35 HENRY What 's she mean by that ? BRADFORD She means that nobody in particular is fooling her . HENRY Who is being fooled . ( BRADFORD shrugs his shoulders ) What 's the surprise Mattie 's arranging for Reggie ? BRADFORD Mattie 's going to marry the Fulton girl to me . HENRY Good ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY ( Amused ) I 'll be sorry to lose you , Cliff , but if Mattie 's set her mind on it you 'll either have to marry the girl or move into an hotel . This place 'll get too warm for you . BRADFORD ( Annoyed ) Mattie 's my sister and now that you 've been married as long as you have  --  there 's no particular disloyalty in my criticising her to you  --   --  HENRY ( Warningly ) I shall be a very prejudiced umpire . BRADFORD Be as partisan as you like ; do n't you think there 's something heinously cold-blooded in suggesting to steal another man 's financee simply for her money and  --   --  p. 36 HENRY ( Laughing ) My dear Cliff , with your facilities for Divine asistance why do you appeal to a weak and mundane broker  --   --  BRADFORD Hang your assistance , Henry  --  I only wish to know if all my associates are as worldly minded as that . HENRY I fear I 'm very commercial myself and ten years evil communication has probably corrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they visit here ? HENRY Fulton 's over only for the day . BRADFORD Of course . I mean the young ladies ? HENRY Oh , that 's entirely in Mattie 's hands . ( Suddenly ) And  --  and yours  --   --  BRADFORD And mine ? HENRY ( Nodding ) Yes , if you stubbornly hold out  --  you know it may take Mattie a year to get you together . BRADFORD Oh  --   --  ( Re-enter ESTELLE with cloak which she puts on a chair . ) ESTELLE May I wait out here with you gentlemen ? p. 37 BRADFORD Delighted . ESTELLE Thank you . BRADFORD ( Indicating house ) Any further complications ? ESTELLE ( Smiling ) Mr. Lumley wishes to wait for Catherine to recover and Mrs. Waterman is explaining the hopelessness of that plan . HENRY Mattie 'd better not manage too enthusiastically . Maybe a slight cough on my part  --  eh ? ( To BRADFORD ) BRADFORD At least a cough . ( Exit HENRY ) ( To ESTELLE ) I feel very sorry for Miss Catherine . ESTELLE I feel sorry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESTELLE Because he takes all her little whims so very seriously . BRADFORD Has she many whims ? ESTELLE Quite as many as the usual American girl . My father and Mr. Fulton were dear friends . My father had no chance to repay the great kindness of Mr. Fulton and I may never have a chance , but I can at least avoid adding to his cares . p. 38 BRADFORD I 'm sure Mr. Fulton must feel very grateful for your influence upon his daughter . ESTELLE ( Shaking head ) Catherine 's fairly self-willed in important matters and  --   --  BRADFORD I meant your unconscious influence . ESTELLE Oh  --  Thank you  --  you think it valuable ? BRADFORD Quite . ESTELLE I should feel more complimented if you had had more opportunities to judge . BRADFORD They are limited as to Miss Catherine perhaps , but you must remember that I observe your influence upon this entire house-hold here . It is normal and womanly . Our plans for a day drift into quite other channels when you are part of the conference . ESTELLE Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like a managing girl . BRADFORD I sha n't . ESTELLE I never introduce a topic  --  never . BRADFORD Perhaps not , but you bring sanity and moderation to its discussion . You bring moderation and temperance to our way of living if I may say so . There  --  there is n't as much wine drunk at this table as there was before you came . p. 39 ESTELLE I knew you were judging unfairly . That 's Catherine 's influence , not mine . Catherine 's a blue ribbon girl  --  a tee-totle crank . I like a little wine , myself . BRADFORD So do I. Total Abstinence is n't temperance . It 's total abstinence . I really believe that the example of your drinking one glass of wine and only one  --  tones up the resolutions of a man like  --  ( Starts to indicate table ) well , any man , much more than Miss Catherine 's refusal . Yours is control . Her 's is prejudice . Or , at least , we argue that way . ESTELLE This is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted to accept it , but I 'm not as good as you think . To begin with , I 'm an awfully stingy person  --  I think I 'd drink a second glass of beer sometimes , but I ca n't drink wine that costs three or four dollars a bottle when there are so many poor women , that I know of , working a whole week for that money . I simply ca n't do it , that 's all . BRADFORD I think you said as much to Mrs. Waterman one morning ? ESTELLE I know it  --  was n't it rude of me ? BRADFORD She did n't consider it rude , I 'm sure . ( Enter ANN , the Cook  --  Irish  --  by stairs  --  L. ) p. 40 ANN ( With asperity ) Phwere 'll you have this bundle , Doctor Bradford ? BRADFORD What is it ? ANN It 's a fannel shirt and two towels and some shoes and a horse 's billy band and  --   --  BRADFORD Oh  --  Mr. Sheldon 's things . ANN I blave they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , please . ANN ( Descending ) James said you wanted them . BRADFORD James was mistaken . ANN ( Grunting as she goes ) Ah  --  o  --  I 'll put ' em under the porch and Mr. Sheldon can  --  ( Grows inaudible ) ESTELLE ( Smiling ) Ann is plainly not a member of your denomination , Doctor . BRADFORD Why plainly ? ESTELLE She would n't disapprove of her own pastors taking exercise . BRADFORD Has she disapproved of my doing so ? ESTELLE All the servants have . p. 41 BRADFORD Oh , have they ? Well , it has occasionally added to their duties . ESTELLE I think the unfriendliness is a question of your prayerbook . We girls add very much to their duties but they like us . BRADFORD ( With some fervor ) There again you see your influence : and with me too  --  May I say that it exists , Miss Estelle ? ESTELLE ( Pause ) If  --  if it is true . BRADFORD It is very true . ( Pause ) Is this knowledge unwelcome ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange  --  I do n't know . BRADFORD Strange  --  in what way ? ESTELLE You 've seemed so right to me all the time as you were , that I should n't have wished to influence you . I 've tried to move towards the ideals that you 've expressed . I 've listened as one who follows , another listens . Why , of course , it 's strange . It could n't be more strange if the morning paper came out with an editorial saying I 'd influenced the editor . ( Laughs anxiously ) BRADFORD ( Smiling ) Ca n't you forget the preacher ? Ca n't you forget that I 'm one ? p. 42 ESTELLE I have at times  --  forgotten it . BRADFORD When ? ESTELLE When you 've been the athlete  --  there ( Indicating garden ) BRADFORD Wo n't you remember that under the clergyman , however wide his clerical field , there is always the man , human , susceptible , with every impulse to which a woman speaks  --  ( Pause ) Will you remember that ? ESTELLE If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resent my remembering that I 'm a man when I ca n't forget for a moment that you are a woman . ESTELLE But I 've never , never tried to make you think of me that way . Have I ? BRADFORD I fear not . ( Enter HENRY . ) HENRY This way , Judge  --  ( To BRADFORD ) Judge Bates  --  Doctor . ( Enter JUDGE BATES . ESTELLE goes up . ) BRADFORD Good-evening , Judge . JUDGE ( They shake hands ) Good-evening , Doctor . ( ESTELLE quietly goes by 2nd door. ) p. 43 JUDGE Now we 've only a moment , Doctor . I 've pushed this matter with the Times . Ordinarily the watchword is " Delay " but in this case I 've made it " Action , action . " ( Taking chair ) Now to Hecuba . My plan is an editorial retraction tomorrow . HENRY But Judge , we ca n't rest on a mere retraction . JUDGE Rest ! Who said rest ? My plan is action  --  action . BRADFORD Good . ( Enter MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind my hearing it , do you ? ( HENRY hushes her . ) JUDGE ( Quickly ) Not at all  --  the retraction is only the beginning  --  there must be damages . We 'll demand one hundred thousand dollars and settle out of court for fifty thousand . HENRY ( To BRADFORD ) Cliff ; I can put fifty thousand into first mortgage bonds  --   --  BRADFORD I could n't take the money , Henry . If some charitable institution  --   --  JUDGE ( Interrupting ) All that can come later . The paper is sending up the man who wrote the article  --  I 've ' phoned him to meet us here . p. 44 HENRY Why not their lawyer ? JUDGE I do n't know . HENRY ( Exaggerating ) Oh , it 's an appeal for mercy , the fellow 'll have a wife and four children and his place on the paper 'll be gone if we press the suit  --   --  BRADFORD Well  --   --  MRS . WATERMAN Now there 's Cliff weakening already . ( She goes to him ) BRADFORD Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day  --  Now you keep still and leave the whole business to the Judge . ( Enter JAMES . ) JAMES Card , sir . HENRY ( With card , reads ) " Morton Taylor , New York Times " . JUDGE That 's the man . HENRY Show him up ? MRS . WATERMAN Wait ! Not through the house , Henry . If he 's the man who wrote that stuff about Cliff , I wo n't have him come though my dining-room , and I do n't want to see him myself . ( To JAMES ) Where is the person ? p. 45 JAMES In the reception room , ma'am , below . MRS . WATERMAN Bring him through the trademen 's entrance . ( Indicates yard ) JAMES Yes , ma'am . ( Exit ) MRS . WATERMAN Come , Henry , we 'll go before he comes . HENRY ( Protesting ) But I want to hear the interview . MRS . WATERMAN Is n't the Judge enough ? JUDGE Quite . MRS . WATERMAN You must go , Henry . Catherine wants Estelle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert poor Mr. Lumley . HENRY ( Going ) I 'll hear a bit of the music , Judge , and then come over to your house . JUDGE Make it the Bar Association . HENRY Very well . MRS . WATERMAN ( In emotion ) Remember , Cliff . JAMES ( In garden ) This way , sir . MRS . WATERMAN There he is  --  Oh . ( Exit , followed by HENRY ) p. 46 JUDGE I 'd better conduct the interview , Doctor ? BRADFORD By all means . JAMES ( At stairs ) Mr. Taylor . TAYLOR ( Entering and regarding surroundings ) This is pretty . Kind of roof-garden effect . ( Exit JAMES to house . ) JUDGE ( At once to business ) You 're Mr. Taylor ? TAYLOR Yes , sir . Good-evening , Doctor . BRADFORD Good-evening . JUDGE ( Savagely ) I 'm Judge Bates . TAYLOR ( With irritating quiet ) Oh , I know you , Judge Bates . JUDGE Your chief telephoned me that he would send up the young man who wrote the article accusing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skirt-dancer . TAYLOR Yes , sir . JUDGE You the man ? TAYLOR Yes , sir  --  ( To BRADFORD ) I tried to make it humorous , of course , but  --   --  p. 47 JUDGE Yes . But we do n't take that view of it , Mr. Taylor . TAYLOR ( Smiling in conciliation ) I 'm sorry . It seems my luck to offend Doctor Bradford when I want him to know that I admire him very much . You know , Doctor , I did n't write any of that stuff about the funeral  --  not a line  --  and I 'd never have winked at you in the world if  --   --  JUDGE We wo n't speak of that , sir . TAYLOR Pardon me , Judge Bates , I 'll speak of it . ( To BRADFORD ) I just want to say , Doctor , that I had no intention of breaking you up at that funeral , and I 've never roasted you in my life . Even this story about Kid Garvey was touched up by the City Editor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? TAYLOR We call them " ' stories " . The newspaper pays for them according to the space they occupy , and  --   --  JUDGE We wo n't take pay on the space basis . Now hear me . To-morrow your paper must print a retraction of that libel in its editorial columns  --  understand ? TAYLOR I understand  --  but  --   --  p. 48 JUDGE ( Commandingly ) Listen to me  --   --  TAYLOR Why listen to you . I 'm up here to keep Dr. Bradford from being put in a ridiculous position by going into court . We wo n't retract anything . He knows that the item was right . BRADFORD What ? TAYLOR See here , Doctor  --  you do n't mean to make the usual clerical denial , do you , because the Kid and Myrtle are both personal friends of mine  --  I 'm on the sporting page as well as on the religious and they 'll both of them make affidavits if I ask them to . JUDGE Affidavit to what ? TAYLOR To having dined with Dr. Bradford as I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perjury to support  --   --  BRADFORD Wait , Judge , there 's manifestly some misunderstanding . Mr. Taylor has evidently mistaken some other person for me . TAYLOR ( Smiling ) Oh , no , Doctor . I wish would n't do that with me . You 're badly advised , that 's all  --   --  ( An auto horn and machinery is heard off. ) p. 49 JUDGE Badly advised ! TAYLOR Very badly advised . JUDGE I 'm advising Dr. Bradford in this action  --  I. TAYLOR That probably explains it . JUDGE ( With increasing intensity ) I advise him to get a retraction . I advise him to get the heaviest possible damages a jury will give a verdict for  --  I advise him to get  --   --  TAYLOR I advise him to get an attorney . JUDGE ( Rising ) You 're an impertinent young pup . TAYLOR ( Rising slowly through respect ) See here , Judge Bates , my paper does n't ask me to stand personal abuse . Now it 's only your age that makes " impertinent young pup " go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're old enough to be my father or  --  I 'd  --  ( Pause ) JUDGE You 'd what ? What 'd you do , sir , what would you do ? TAYLOR ( Very quietly ) Why I 'd hit you on the nose . p. 50 BRADFORD ( Interposing as the JUDGE blusters ) My friends  --  one moment . ( Auto sound ceases . ) TAYLOR ( To BRADFORD ) A man should n't presume on his physical debility . JUDGE Have the man leave the house , Doctor , or I ca n't answer for the consequences . BRADFORD I think , Mr. Taylor , your visit has accomplished all that we can do at this time . TAYLOR But if this man is advising you to make a denial and back it up with a law suit  --   --  JUDGE You 've been asked to go , have n't you ? Do you want a servant to kick you out ? TAYLOR Oh , there wo n't anybody kick me out , Judge . BRADFORD ( Disturbed ) Of course not . JUDGE Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) BRADFORD One moment , Judge . An automobile just stopped at the house  --   --  JAMES Mr. Sheldon 's come , sir . p. 51 JUDGE Sheldon ? Ask him to come up here at once . JAMES Yes , sir . ( Exit by stairs ) JUDGE Now remember , young man , you were twice asked to leave this house and refused to do so . TAYLOR Is Sheldon going to put me out ? BRADFORD I hope it wo n't be necessary , Mr. Taylor , for anybody to use violence . TAYLOR I want only half a dozen words with you alone , Doctor . BRADFORD ( Refusing ) My case is in my attorney 's hands . ( Enter KID from garden . ) KID Good-evening , Doctor . JUDGE Mr. Sheldon , I want you to throw this man out on the sidewalk . TAYLOR Hello , Kid ! KID ( Easily ) Hello , Taylor , what 's the row ? TAYLOR How 's Myrtle ? KID Great ; why ? TAYLOR I thought she looked a little tired the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradford were at the table there , up at Rye Beach . p. 52 KID Tired ? I thought she looked great . Did n't you , Doctor ? That young lady I introduced you to ? BRADFORD You mean Miss MacCarthy ? KID Yes . TAYLOR She 's Miss Myrtle Morrison in the theatres , you understand . She 's the Kid 's girl . BRADFORD You call Mr. Sheldon " Kid "  --  is that a nickname ? TAYLOR You did n't know that Mr. Sheldon 's professional name was " Kid Garvey ? " JUDGE Kid Garvey ? Are you Kid Garvey ? ( KID nods . Pause ) The middle weight champion ? KID ( Easily ) Oh , yes , but I do n't rub it in . If people do n't get on themselves , why I do n't go round puttin ' ' em wise  --  but what 's the trouble ? You do n't need me to put anybody on the sidewalk with the Doctor there  --  Eh , Doc ! ha , ha . ( BRADFORD sits stunned after a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Exit , followed by TAYLOR ) KID ( Trying to divine the situation ) The old man go'na try it . ( Laughs ) Say , I want to see that . ( Following ) p. 53 BRADFORD Mr. Sheldon ! ( KID stops and turns ) Sit down a moment . ( KID returns and sits . Pause . BRADFORD slowly passes his hand over his face ) KID Ai n't you feeling well , Doctor ? BRADFORD Not very , no . KID ( Nodding to house ) same trouble , eh ? BRADFORD Trifling misunderstanding , yes . KID Well , that 's a nice fellow all right , that reporter  --   --  BRADFORD Why did n't you tell me , Sheldon , that you were Kid Garvey when I asked you last week ? KID Well , you see , Doctor , I only took you on to please Bill Muldoon that 's all . Sheldon 's my right name , anyway , and Bill  --  Bill said for me not to say anything , see ? It was the preachers mostly that backcapped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a preacher , Bill thought you might get cold feet . BRADFORD I see . ( Pause ) So you considerately said nothing to impair my circulation . KID No . Besides it 's a rest for a fighter not to have everybody on to what he is . Suppose they put up a fat purse for the best preacher , and you held the belt for America , England and Australia  --  just suppose  --  why you would n't butt in with your medals every time some guy dropped his guard  --  now , would you ? p. 54 BRADFORD I do n't think I should , but in this case it would have spared some trouble if you had been frank with me . KID Then again , you 're wanting to keep everything dark yourself , not wanting to go to a regular gym . Or even , put on a sweater and take a run in the Park  --  why it all tipped me not to get too flossy . BRADFORD Naturally , naturally . ( Re-enter JUDGE and TAYLOR . ) JUDGE Doctor , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bar Association . I think the whole matter will be dropped . BRADFORD Very well , Judge . TAYLOR And do n't get any fixed idea , Doctor , that I 'm unfriendly to you . BRADFORD Thank you . TAYLOR Or the paper either . There 's only one man on the entire staff that 's got it in for you . Good-night , Kid . ( Exeunt JUDGE and TAYLOR ) KID Good-night , Beau . ( Pause ) His paper been turnin ' you over ? BRADFORD One might call it that . KID Well , everything them fellows say , Doctor , good or bad , helps your business as long as the public do n't think you 're selling out . What is it they say about you ? p. 55 BRADFORD Oh , there was a rather unkind account of our little lunch at Rye Beach . You did n't see it ? ( KID shakes his head . ) KID ( Taking a cigarette ) Got a match , Doctor ? BRADFORD ( Passing scrap book ) Read that while I get you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with book ) " The Reverend Clifton Bradford is taking a more muscular , and if possible , a more humorous view of life  --  " ( A rose falls on the book from above ) Hello .

Looks up  --  his face lights up with recognition ) Say  --  ( Looks after BRADFORD  --  in whisper ) I want to see you  --  ( Gives a signal that BRADFORD returns ) ( Re-enter BRADFORD , with alcohol light . ) BRADFORD Read it ? KID Not all . It 's kind a dark . ( Takes the lamp and reads , also lighting his cigarette  --  reads mumbling : ) " Jolly little dinner  --  m  --  m  --  Kid Garvey  --  m  --  m short skirt dancer  --  pleasure palace " . ( Speaks ) You know I ought to kick on that  --  Myrtle 's at Kieth 's . She has n't done a turn at the Pleasure Palace in two years . You know they do n't care what they say , these newspaper guys . ( Pause ) That sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRADFORD You can tell the young lady that I sympathize with her . KID ( Putting book on table ) I will ; and she 'll appreciate it . You made a hit with her . BRADFORD ( Pause ) I 'm very much obliged , Mr. Sheldon , for the good you 've done me physically . I think I still owe you twenty dollars . KID Oh , that 's good any time . BRADFORD Better now . ( Hands a bill ) KID And you do n't have to call me Sheldon any more if you do n't want to  --  men that know me as well as you do call me Kid . ( Rises ) BRADFORD Thank you . I had your things wrapped up for you . The cook has them . ( Crosses toward rail ) KID ( Killing time , and watching window ) Thanks . Ca n't sell you that automobile , then ? BRADFORD I do n't think I could use it , really . KID We made that run to Rye Beach all right , did n't we ? BRADFORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps . p. 57 KID ( Reflectively ) Rye Beach ! ( Pause ) What was the lawyer and that reporter scrappin ' about ? BRADFORD Oh , the Judge had begun suit against the paper . That is what I might have avoided if you had n't have been so modest . KID Suit ? Why ? BRADFORD Well you see , I did n't know that you were the  --  Kid Garvey , or that Miss McCarthy was the dancer Miss Morrison , and the whole thing seemed malicious  --  it seemed invented . KID ( Pause ) Oh ! ( Getting sullen  --  pause ) So you sued the paper ? BRADFORD An action was contemplated , yes . KID I see . Havin ' a sandwich with me was bad enough to sue about was it ? BRADFORD Well , you read the item  --  t'was n't so much the fact as it was the spirit of it . KID Lemme see that . ( Takes book and light again . Reads ) BRADFORD My vestry has asked some very annoying questions about the item . KID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's she ? BRADFORD The vestry is the managing board of my church  --  a council of gentlemen . KID A silk-stocking bunch , I suppose . BRADFORD They might be more democratic , no doubt . KID ( Putting book on table ) Well , say , Doctor , you tell ' em from me that I draw just as much water in my profession as any of them does in theirs . I 've come out of the ring in nothing but a pair of skates and and a " G " string and shook hands with the best men in the country . BRADFORD Oh , it is n't a personal matter Sheldon . It is an ethical one . It 's a clergyman 's duty to do anything he can for every man ; and in your case it would be a great pleasure besides , because you 're a most likeable chap  --  but , do n't you see , it 's the business . Clergymen do n't dine with  --  with Champions because that would be as much as to say that the cleryman approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides that , you own a liquor place , do n't you ? KID I own a saloon , yes . Every fighter owns one if he wins out . BRADFORD Well of course , a clergyman is n't expected to approve of that . p. 59 KID I suppose not . But on the Rye Beach trip , I just wanted to show you my auto . I thought no , body 'd pay any attention to us . Thousands of people that know me in the ring do n't know me at all with my clothes on  --  and meeting Myrtle there was pure accident . BRADFORD I 'm sure of it . KID Because I like you , Doctor . You 're a sure hit with me , and I do n't need anybody 's money . My saloon 's worth 500 a week and I can turn ten thousand clear with a dub " knock out .

It is n't like you . That 's the first vain thing I 've ever seen you do . KID Why not do it ? Good-evening  --  ( To ESTELLE , easily ) ESTELLE Good-evening . BRADFORD Because it 's burning a week 's sustenance for some family . If you do n't want it , Miss Kitteridge would like it , I 'm sure , to send to needy persons whom she knows , persons in distress , want and misery . p. 60 KID All right , give it to her . ESTELLE Why was Mr. Sheldon burning it ? BRADFORD ( Going c. to ESTELLE ) That I might tell my vestrymen that the champion middle weight fighter of the world , " Kid Garvey " , does n't need their patronage nor their approval . ESTELLE You mean  --  ? BRADFORD That Mr. Sheldon is that popular hero . ESTELLE Oh . BRADFORD Good-night , Sheldon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 've considerable work at my table when I get back .

ESTELLE Do you think Miss Fulton would have given you her confidence as she has if she 'd known you were Kid Garvey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy that I do n't tell ' em . ESTELLE Well , you do n't know Catherine . Kid Garvey 's a name that 's been pretty thoroughly discussed during the last few days in this house . Why , you own a saloon .

I take a glass of wine with my dinner  --  yes . KID Well I do n't  --  not even with my dinner . ( Displays his cigarette ) Four cigarettes a day . p. 62 ESTELLE But you do n't know what you 've done . Kiss Fulton 's engaged to marry one of the most fashionable and well-known men in New York , and your attention , Mr. Sheldon , attentions that I 've almost felt it my duty to report to Mr. Fulton , have made her discontented with her engagement . She 's thinking seriously of saying " no " to the gentleman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any chances . I 'm engaged myself to marry a girl that 's got more reputation in a minute than Miss Fulton 's friend has got in a year . She 's a planet . ESTELLE So much the worse , then . All this has been very disloyal to her . KID Well , ( Pause ) that 's a long story too . Everyone has to do the best he can . I 'm being square with your little friend , though . ESTELLE Well , be square with yourself . Miss Fulton 's waiting for you in the reception room , and  --   --  KID ( Starting to steps ) Oh . ESTELLE ( Stopping him ) But I want you to promise me that this shall be the last time you try to see her , the last time . KID Oh , no . ESTELLE Yes . You must know , Mr. Sheldon , that Mr. Fulton 's daughter can not continue an acquaintance with a man of your profession  --  with a man who keeps a saloon .

BRADFORD ( Alone ) It is useless . The thoughts do not come . Much less the words ! A man who has just laid violent hands upon a fellowman even under justifying circumstances , as the world would view them , ca n't utter words consonant with the spirit to which we look for guidance . I shall repeat my old sermon on " Let him cast the first stone . " I have n't given it in five years . ( Pause . ANN passes heavily up the stairs from below .

I went over to the Bar Association to meet Judge Bates and when I got back to the concert the folks said Lumley had gone out an hour before to telephone here about Miss Fulton . BRADFORD Have n't heard of it . Perhaps Maggie answered the ' phone . HENRY Probably an excuse . Poor Lumley must have been dreadfully bored with just Mattie and old Fulton when he 'd planned a box full of young people Well , I met the Judge  --  ( Laughs ) ha , ha , I have n't told Mattie  --  I told Fulton , but not Mattie  --  ha , ha !

BRADFORD The small of his back and one hip HENRY ( In a hungry smile ) What 'd you do to him ? p. 80 BRADFORD ( Walking down-stage and up around table ) I used physical force when for years I 've been counselling only passive resistance . I fear that the time spent under Mr. Sheldon has been a mistake in every way . I was sure of my self-control , I thought , but when I felt James using his strength on me everything that I 'd practiced with Sheldon seemed to rush to my finger tips . I 'm thankful that I did n't strike the poor fellow . HENRY What did you do ? BRADFORD ( L. C. ) I applied a chin and elbow tackle that Mr. Sheldon favors very much . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throw him ? BRADFORD ( Going down R. ) I regret to say nearly across the round table on the porch there . ( Nods towards audience ) HENRY ( In glee ) Why , Cliff , shake ! I knew that seminary could n't spoil a good man . But what was it about ? BRADFORD I do n't know . Miss Fulton found herself locked out on the porch . She seemed in such terror and difficulty that I did n't wait to go downstairs but simply dropped from the window . Just then the cook came up from the garden and James unlocked the dining-room door . The cook took charge of the young woman who was incoherently hysterical and led her upstairs . When I attempted to follow , James took hold of me. p. 81 HENRY ( Slowly ) Why , they must have thought that  --  ( Pause ) BRADFORD ( D. C. Pause ) They did . They still think so . HENRY And the Fulton girl did n't say anything ? BRADFORD ( Shaking head ) She 'd gone with the cook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --   --  BRADFORD Yes . HENRY ( Smiling ) As James unlocked the door . BRADFORD As he unlocked what was left of the door . HENRY " Left of the door "  --  what do you mean ? ( The smile fades ) BRADFORD The young lady had kicked in most of the lower part of it . HENRY " Kicked in ? " ( BRADFORD nods ) Those back doors in the dining-room ? BRADFORD With the diamond-shaped sash . HENRY Why , Mattie brought those doors from Rome . BRADFORD Yes . p. 82 HENRY Confound the little idiot , could n't she wait a minute . BRADFORD She gave a distinct impression of impatience . Even after I 'd come to her assistance she continued to kick in an occasional glass . HENRY Why did n't you stop her ? BRADFORD I did finally . I think it was my efforts in that direction that misled the cook and  --  and James . HENRY Well , of course ; it must have looked as if she was trying to get away from you . BRADFORD It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow her ? BRADFORD Yes , to make her dissipate that impression . ( Walks L. ) HENRY And James said " No , no . " BRADFORD Substantially " no , no .

Reluctantly ) Oh , I just pressed his right elbow against his body with my left hand this way  --  then I half turned and put my right foot behind his  --  left foot so  --   --  p. 83 HENRY Yes .

MAGGIE ( In doorway ) Pardon , sir  --  There 's a man downstairs from the noosepaper . HENRY ( Goes up R. C. ) A reporter ? What 's he want ?

Pause . The men regard each other ) Well ? BRADFORD ( At table ) I expected it . HENRY You think it 's about this busines ? BRADFORD What else ? " To see Doctor Bradford or Miss Fulton 's father . " HENRY ( C. ) How does he know about it ? BRADFORD Oh , the servants . The other items probably went by the same channel . ( Enter MAGGIE and TAYLOR . ) TAYLOR ( Coming down C. ) Good-evening . BRADFORD How do you do again ? HENRY ( R. C. ) Have a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a telephone from the police station saying that Miss Fulton had been  --  BRADFORD ( L. C. Interrupting ) Not a word of truth in it , Mr. Taylor . The young lady is of a very nervous and excitable temperament . She thought for the moment only that she had been locked out of doors . It was dark , she was alone  --   --  p. 85 TAYLOR And the Kid came to her assistance ? BRADFORD ( Cross R. C. ) Who ? TAYLOR ( To table ) The Kid . HENRY ( Smiling ) That was Doctor Bradford . But do n't say anything about that side of it now , Mr. Taylor , for me . You say you 're kindly disposed . Here 's the time to show it . TAYLOR ( Sits at table ) Very well . Only tell me the story . Where does Dr. Bradford come in ? HENRY The man was impertinent  --  he did n't mean to be , but that does n't matter , I 've discharged him . The Doctor took the man 's right elbow this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and HENRY gladly illustrates the tackle ) his right elbow in the doctor 's left hand and then the doctor 's right palm under the fellow 's chin this way and heave ! There you are . TAYLOR Then the machine did n't run over him at all ? BRADFORD ( R. C. ) How 's that ? TAYLOR Was this after the automobile struck him ? HENRY ( C. ) Automobile ? p. 86 TAYLOR Yes , the police said the machine passed completely over him and that the kid refused to stop . A bycycle policeman chased the Kid and had to fire two shots at him . BRADFORD I know nothing of any automobile incident . TAYLOR I only got it over the ' phone  --  but my information is that Kid Garvey and Miss Catherine Fulton are in the police station now  --  and that a man whose identity is unknown is in the hospital with injuries inflicted by the Kid 's automobile . BRADFORD Miss Fulton and " The Kid , " absurd ! TAYLOR It caught me all right , because I 'd seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Fulton was visiting here . Two things the police did n't know .

BRADFORD Some other Fulton  --  or Sheldon may have given that name instead of the real name of some lady with him . HENRY ( To TAYLOR ) Miss Catherine Fulton ? TAYLOR Miss Catherine Fulton of Philadelphia . p. 87 HENRY ( To BRADFORD ) You sure she went upstairs with the cook ? BRADFORD Reasonably certain . HENRY ( Crosses R. ) Wait a minute and I 'll send up and see . ( Rings ) TAYLOR ( To BRADFORD ) But you were along , you say ? BRADFORD I ? Along ? No , I did n't say that .

FULTON ( Also outside ) Deplorable incident . HENRY Here 's Mr. Fulton now . ( Goes into hall ) MRS . WATERMAN ( Off , but approaching ) Why , Henry , have you seen those dining-room doors ?

WATERMAN ( Maintaining the pressure ) But  --  those dining-room doors  --  Mr. Fulton saw those . ( Appeals to FULTON ) p. 90 BRADFORD ( Down R. ) That was a little accident , rather incident  --  which I 'll explain , Mattie . The question before us now is a foolish report from the police that Miss Catherine had been arrested for fast driving in an automobile . MR . FULTON ( Up C. Easily , to TAYLOR ) Oh  --  no  --  no  --  nothing in that . Our automobile is in Philadelphia and my chauffeur has positive orders from me regarding the speed at all times .

TAYLOR ( With reportorial insistence ) But this girl is supposed to be Miss Catherine Fulton of Philadelphia . p. 91 MR . FULTON You sure , sir . Why that supposition ? TAYLOR Because she had a bag with her with a set of silver toilet articles engraved " Catherine Fulton " ; and some jewelry and the bag had a tag " C. F. , Philadelphia . " MR . FULTON Catherine 's bag is fitted with engraved articles  --  perhaps  --   --  ( MRS .

FULTON ( To TAYLOR , in triumph ) But the young lady was not Miss Catherine Fulton of Philadelphia . TAYLOR So I see . MR . FULTON So you see . HENRY ( Going L. C. ) And Miss Fulton 's name need n't appear in the newspapers ? TAYLOR ( Hesitating ) Well  --  ( Pause . Crosses the KID to meet HENRY ) MRS . WATERMAN ( To CATHERINE , still agitated . Brings her down R. ) There , my dear  --  the gentleman will arrange it , I 'm sure . ( CAROLINE sits ) TAYLOR ( Answering HENRY ) Perhaps not .

KID ( Down L. ) Well , you see , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver in it .

FULTON I 'm very much indebted to her , I 'm sure . TAYLOR But did n't want to give her own name . KID No  --  so they said : " Oh , where 'd you get the bag ? " See ? Caught with the goods , that 's all . ( Crosses up C. to BRADFORD ) Now if the Doctor 'll go with me and say he knows it 's all right . A preacher with his pull  --  Or take a letter from the  --  from the owner of the bag  --  ( Slowly and significantly ) This lady friend of mine wo n't have to sleep on a bench .

KID ( C.  --  slewly gives his significant news to BRADFORD ) My lady friend that 's up in the station had a twenty-dollar bill with the corner burnt off .

BRADFORD Yes , yes ! TAYLOR ( Going up C. ) Well , I 'm glad to get the story right . I think I can keep Miss Fulton 's name out of it , if I can get the other men in time  --  and you gentlemen better believe the Kid took the bag by mistake because a charge of that kind wo n't help his business . BRADFORD Thank you . TAYLOR Good-night . BRADFORD ( Up C. ) Good-night , Mr. Taylor ! You  --  you know your way out ? TAYLOR Oh , yes ! ( Exit ) p. 100 BRADFORD ( Down C. Returning ) .

MR . FULTON ( Up L. C. ) But why that ? BRADFORD ( C. ) We recover the jewels ; and with them out of the case entirely it keeps Miss Catherine 's name out of print . MR .

I was crossing the street to the telephone  --  to telephone to you and this automobile struck me . I remember only the lights and the buildings mixing up together and then a doctor saying in a very loud voice : " That will do . He swallowed it . " CATHERINE ( To MRS .

One pretty girl in a cap was at the foot of the couch  --  another pretty girl in another cap was at the side of the couch .

LUMLEY Well , the doctor 's kept saying , " do n't talk , " " do n't talk , " when I never wanted to talk so much in my life . I do n't talk much as a rule . MRS .

MR . FULTON I ca n't rise to that standard , Doctor  --  where did Estelle know this man ? When did she meet him ? He has seen Catherine only at the window . What opportunities did Estelle take for a more intimate acquaintance ? She has been Catherine 's companion . I must know the influence that surround my daughter . BRADFORD True ! Inform yourself by all means , Mr. Fulton , but do n't be unnecessarily cruel . Miss Kitteridge has certain rights as an individual that even the father of Miss Fulton should not transgress . ( Goes C. ) MR . FULTON ( L. C. ) I am measurably in the position of her own father and I have certain rights that must not be transgressed even by Estelle 's most sympathetic friends . MRS .

FULTON Indeed ? p. 129 BRADFORD I wish Miss Kitteridge to know that my trust and confidence in her character is so great that I need no explanations . MR . FULTON ( Down L. C. ) Which must be very gratifying to Estelle I 'm sure  --  but I perceive that your confidence , Doctor , is not shared by your sister  --  and I regret that I do n't feel it myself to your reassuring degree . Now , Estelle , I have n't been a harsh guardian , have I ? ESTELLE ( Turning at table ) Harsh ! why , Mr. Fulton , my own father could not have been kinder to me . ( Goes to him ) I 'm awfully sorry to grieve you  --  awfully sorry . MR . FULTON What is there between you and this young man ? ESTELLE Nothing  --  nothing whatever . MR .

ESTELLE Yes . HENRY ( At door ) Mattie . ( Pause ) We do n't need to complicate this affair , do we ? MRS . WATERMAN I think not . Good-night everybody .

KID ( Laughing " not much " ) She held the watch for us and called time . BRADFORD The girl ? Is it possible ? KID Oh , yes . Well , there bein ' a lady present , you see I thought I 'd make it short . The other fellow wanted to cut some " figure eights " and that sort of " fancy work " , but I got to his gold fillings in the middle of the second and it was " Sunday " for him .

Her genuine sympathy at that time commanded my respect also . KID My business teaches a fellow one thing , Doctor  --  If you ca n't win , be a good loser !

KID You see , everybody says a fighter ai n't a gentleman . BRADFORD ( Controlling his wish to smile ) I 'm familiar with that prejudice . KID Well , here 's a girl that has her picture in the paper if she goes to the horse show ; and her picture in the paper because she 's goin ' to marry one of the richest men in New York  --  to society queen . Now , anybody that catches her has got to be a gentleman , ai n't he ? And when I saw it coming my way , I said : " I 'll just steal this one and they 'll all have to sit up and stop talking .

Your behavior since your auto run over . Mr. Lumley has been much more the work of a gentleman than stealing even a society queen .

KID Why , I did that just to be kind to you and him . BRADFORD Well , kindness , my boy , is the chief mark of the gentleman . KID Kindness ? ( BRADFORD nods ) Then I should think a preacher 'd be a gentleman . BRADFORD Many of them are . KID Well , you 're one all right , Doc .

ESTELLE And it was her youth and  --  well her youth that made her like him and he really was very attractive when you were wrestling out there  --  you both are . BRADFORD Thank you ! ESTELLE Well , you knew it , did n't you ? Men would n't allow ladies to watch them in their athletics if they thought they appeared to disadvantage . BRADFORD I suppose not ! ESTELLE He wo n't try to take her away again , will he ? BRADFORD No , and if he did , Catherine would n't go . She has discovered that her love for Reginald is real . ESTELLE If the truth can be kept from Reginald I shall feel repaid for any misfortune that may come to me . BRADFORD No misfortune shall come to you . ESTELLE If we could only put some creditable color on it to Mr. Fulton . I have valued his good opinion so highly . BRADFORD What creditable color did you place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the reason I took your room . If I 'd have shared hers I 'm sure I 'd have told her everything .

I never dreamed that you knew  --  until  --  until it amused you so much . BRADFORD ( Smiling ) You must remember that I have a cultivated taste for amusement  --   --  ESTELLE How did you know ? BRADFORD ( Pointing to door of balcony ) I was there . ESTELLE ( Inhaling and shaking head ominously ) Catherine is all impulse  --  at the first moment of any emotion  --  all impulse . BRADFORD Mattie fetched those doors from Rome . ESTELLE Oh , I 'm so sorry . ( Pause ) She knew Catherine did it ? BRADFORD No . But she probably does by this time .

And that 's a luxury that I occasionally insist upon . ESTELLE But why should he know it ? BRADFORD I live with him . ESTELLE I do n't understand you . BRADFORD There 's one qualification for the ministry that a clergyman must have and must permit no one to successfully challenge . ESTELLE What is that ? BRADFORD His intelligence . ( Pause . ESTELLE shakes her head , not comprehending ) I 'm going to tell my sister and her husband this morning that I 've asked Estelle Kitteridge to be my wife and I do n't want them to think that I 'd have done that if her greater inclination was to elope with a pugilist .

( HENRY crosses with it to R. ) LUMLEY Glac  --  is n't it ? ( Drinks ) MRS . WATERMAN ( Smiling through set teeth ) Yes  --  quite . HENRY ( Despairingly at LUMLEY ) Glac ! Still very weak  --  ha , ha ! ( Enter ESTELLE with melon and dishes . ) ESTELLE Why , Mr. Lunley ! LUMLEY ( Rising ) Good-morning . CATHERINE Please keep your seat . ESTELLE I 'm so glad to see you able to do this  --  but are you strong enough really ? LUMLEY Oh , yes . MR . FULTON ( To MRS . WATERMAN , and referring to ESTELLE 'S composure ) Incredible ! p. 159 LUMLEY Of course I look a trifle emaciated in this outfit but  --  How are you doctor . ( Looking to door I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Is n't this rather heroic . ( They meet in front of table ) LUMLEY The clothes are collossal  --  but I thought I should be at this breakfast at all hazards  --  ( Enter MAGGIE with coffee pot . ) MRS . WATERMAN Here 's the coffee  --  sit down Cliff . CATHERINE ( To LUMLEY ) Please . ( Leads him to chair again . Bell rings ) ( MAGGIE exit . ) HENRY What 's that ? MRS . WATERMAN Front door probably  --  Here is some iced melon Catherine I 'm sure Reggie will like that . CATHERINE Yes  --  ( Gets a piece for LUMLEY ) MRS . WATERMAN ( Insincerely and insinuatingly ) Sit down , Estelle dear . ESTELLE Have you everything you need ? p. 160 MRS . WATERMAN Oh , yes , thank you ! LUMLEY I had one piece of this before  --  before I made my toilet . BRADFORD Yes , Miss Kitteridge sent it to you . LUMLEY I knew it was some good friend . ( FULTON looks at MRS . WATERMAN . ) CATHERINE And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter MAGGIE I R. ) MAGGIE Judge Bates , ma 'm ! HENRY Ask the judge to step up here . MAGGIE Yes , sir . ( Exit ) LUMLEY Judge Newton Bates ? BRADFORD Yes . LUMLEY I have n't seen Judge Bates since I was at Yale . BRADFORD ( Grunting ) ' m . ( MRS . WATERMAN coughs . ) CATHERINE Was Judge Bates at Yale ? LUMLEY ( With meaning ) He was when I saw him last . So was Doctor Bradford . MR . FULTON Why I thought you were a Harvard man , Doctor ? p. 161 BRADFORD ( Nods ) My dear Reginald , are n't we on tender ground . LUMLEY Perhaps . ( To CATHERINE ) Did n't you ever hear how Doctor Bradford and Judge Bates went to New Haven to see me ? CATHERINE No . LUMLEY Nor read it in the papers ? CATHERINE No . ( Enter JUDGE with morning papers . ) JUDGE Good-morning . OMNES ( In character ) Good-morning , Judge ! JUDGE ( Full of his news ) Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BRADFORD Yes , we 've got him here . JUDGE ( Astonished ) What ! LUMLEY How are you , Judge Bates . Have n't seen you since New Haven ( Half rises ) JUDGE Why , Mr. Lumley , this is astonishing . You 're in bed for several weeks according to the papers . It did n't injure you ? LUMLEY Thank you , no. p. 162 BRADFORD Does n't even hurt his feelings since he learned who did it . JUDGE ( Turning to ESTELLE slowly ) Oh  --  Oh ! ESTELLE What do the papers do with me , Judge ? JUDGE Not mentioned . MR . FULTON Nor  --  nor  --  my family ? JUDGE Not at all . MR . FULTON Ah ! ( In relief ) BRADFORD You have all the papers ? JUDGE All . That reporter fellow brought them to me  --  to show that he 'd done as he promised he would . I offered him a check for his services but he refused it  --  His only request was that I should show the papers to you . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers on table . ) LUMLEY Cheer up , doctor . BRADFORD I ! Do I seem unhappy ? LUMLEY Yes , you do , and the whole matter is less serious than you think . You 'll pardon me , Miss Kitteridge but this seems a very opportune moment for me to make certain statements . ( To JUDGE ) The Kid  --  sat up with me last night . p. 163 JUDGE Sheldon . LUMLEY ( Very seriously ) Yes . He said a great many things about his influence over women that I did n't understand at all  --  seemed mere boasting and vanity  --  until Mr. Fulton told me this mornthat well  --  who the lady was that Sheldon had with him . JUDGE The papers all agree  --  Miss Morrison . LUMLEY ( Smiling ) I understand . Now all I want to say is , and what he meant me to understand was , that a person  --  man or woman can be carried away  --  temporarily  --  by such an admiration as the Kid would inspire  --  why he 's the best man we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of him attract a girl ? ESTELLE Thank you , Mr. Lumley . CATHERINE ( Pained ) Oh  --  Estelle do n't . ( FULTON indignant . ) LUMLEY What 's the matter ? CATHERINE ( Rising ) Excuse me , please . ( Starts off ) LUMLEY ( Pleading ) Just a word , Catherine . p. 164 MR . FULTON ( Arresting her ) My dear ! LUMLEY You know doctor , what men are under similar influences and you know what there worth afterwards  --  So do the Judge  --   --  ESTELLE Mr. Lumley is tiring himself  --  I can see  --   --  LUMLEY ( Faintly ) Perhaps  --   --  CATHERINE ( Returning ) Then please do n't , Reginald . You do n't understand the situation at all . LUMLEY Maybe not  --  but let us all be charitable . ( To BRADFORD ) You did me a great service that time at New Haven doctor and now I 'll do you one in spite of yourself . BRADFORD Thank you , Reginald I know you mean it . HENRY But I 'm sure we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUMLEY ( Indicating BRADFORD ) Then let him tell it himself  --  or the judge . I want Mr. Fulton and his daughter to know it  --  They should have known it before . CATHERINE What is it ? p. 165 LUMLEY ( Positively ) Tell her ! BRADFORD ( Pause ) Reginald at college was quite the average college boy in many ways  --  especially the young man at college spoiled by too much money . LUMLEY On , I was wilder than the average . BRADFORD He became involved in an affair ( To MRS . WATERMAN ) I think we called them affairs ? ( MRS . WATERMAN nods ) with a girl in the chorus ( Pause . CATHERINE looks down ) That 's all is n't it ? MRS . WATERMAN Why of course , it is n't all , Cliff or the affair would still be going on . Tell the extent of it now that you 've started and what stopped it . BRADFORD The Judge stopped it . JUDGE ( Smiling ) Oh , I think you stopped it , Doctor  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it "  --  He paid the girl some money and got back Reggie 's letters and I went with Reggie 's mother and persuaded Reggie to quit following the opera company around and go back and finish out his term at College . Now that 's all of it , is n't it ? p. 166 LUMLEY ( Pause ) Yes  --  and that was a good deal worse than this little flyer last night . BRADFORD Of course , but men expect women to forgive them  --  they are seldom equal themselves to forgiving women . LUMLEY They should be and a man of your calling above all others . BRADFORD So you say my dear Reginald when you 're advising me . Support you were in my position  --  You . LUMLEY ( With heroism ) I ! Why then  --   --  CATHERINE ( Standing up ) Oh , stop  --  stop . It 's cruel of your Doctor Bradford  --  you , the only one who knows , to make Mr. Lumley commit himself  --   --  LUMLEY ( Deprecatingly ) My dear Catherine , it was all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CATHERINE Not what I mean . It was I  --  Catherine Fulton who was going with Mr. Sheldon last night . Estelle locked me out there and took my place  --  see the door where I broke it . ( In a burst ) and now I 'm going out of the room . p. 167 BRADFORD ( Stopping her ) One moment  --  where are you going ? CATHERINE Let me go please  --  let me go . BRADFORD Yes , in a moment . I 'm learning , Miss Catherine , that your first impulses are sometimes unsafe . MR . FULTON ( Sternly ) I 'll take her , Doctor Bradford . ( Does so . BRADFORD , goes to LUMLEY ) Catherine ! Catherine !  --  I wish you to control yourself  --  my daughter  --  we have some apologies to make here . LUMLEY ( Rising ) Rot ! This is n't any time for apologies . I 've been all through this myself ( Waves FULTON aside  --  puts his arm about CATHERINE who still cries convulsively  --  starts out  --  at R. , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face in his breast with an added burst . LUMLEY gulps , looks back at the others , softly waves his left hand twice as if fanning them back ) ( Exit with CATHERINE . ) MR . FULTON ( Pause ) You knew ? ( To BRADFORD . BRADFORD , nods ) ' m . ( Looks about ) Everybody knew ? p. 168 BRADFORD Only Miss Kitteridge . MR . FULTON Oh . ( Turns to ESTELLE ) What did she say  --  " you took her place , " Estelle ? ESTELLE Yes , Mr. Fulton . JUDGE ( Slowly ) Well  --  well . MR . FULTON She was really  --  going away ( ESTELLE nods ) with that prize fighter ? ( To BRADFORD ) BRADFORD ( Comfortingly ) The best man in the world  --  in his class . MR . FULTON ( Mildly ) And my God ! ( Pause ) what a class  --  ( To ESTELLE ) is she in love with him ? ESTELLE Not now  --  no . MR . FULTON Has there been  --  any  --  any dreadfully compromising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m . ( Pause . Goes to ESTELLE ) My dear Estelle  --  ( Pause ) My dear Estelle ! ( Turns to others ) What can I say to this noble girl ? p. 169 JUDGE ( With watch ) you might tell her it 's time to go to the police court  --  That 's what I came to say to her . BRADFORD That 's not necessary , now , is it ? There 'll be no complaint . JUDGE We were released from the Poilce Station last night under bond to appear this morning . MR . FULTON We 'll forfeit the bond  --  forfeit it . Pay anything  --  what is it ? JUDGE It is my word . The young lady was released on my personal promise to produce her in court this morning . It will only be an appearance , my dear  --  probably not have to say anything . BRADFORD I shall go with you . ( Easily to ESTELLE ) It does n't matter , my dear . MRS . WATERMAN Is Estelle 's name in the police record ? JUDGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alias ? JUDGE Yes . The Kid in the fulness of his experience gave a fictitious name . MR . FULTON The why must Estelle go ? A fictitious name ? JUDGE The name is fictitious , but it calls for a real girl . p. 170 MR . FULTON Ah  --  well  --  we can at least bear our part of the consequences . If any girl will do  --  Catherine shall go . ( To door ) ESTELLE Oh , no , Mr. Fulton . MR . FULTON ( Firmly ) Yes . ( Exit ) BRADFORD ( To JUDGE ) What will be the character of the  --  the exercises in the police court ? JUDGE The proceeding ? BRADFORD Yes . JUDGE They 'll call out the case  --  we appear  --   --  ESTELLE Do I say " present "  --  or just hold up my hand ? JUDGE Neither . You come up to the bar or railing with me . I do the talking for our side unless of course you should be put on the stand . BRADFORD Is that likely ? JUDGE Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who will be the only complaining witness if Lumley stays away . HENRY Well , ask him not to dispute it . p. 171 JUDGE I shall .  --  But I believe that he 's professionally disposed to rebuttal is n't he ? BRADFORD What is the punishment ? JUDGE I have n't read the ordinance . Some fine probably . HENRY I 'll pay the fine if he 'll keep still . ( KID and MYRTLE appear at glass door  --  KID knocks . ) MRS . WATERMAN This is the man now , is n't it ? BRADFORD Yes . ( HENRY goes to door . ) MRS . WATERMAN Why does n't he ring the front bell HENRY He 's always used the tradesman 's entrance , my dear . ( Opens door ) Come in , Mr. Sheldon . KID ( Entering ) My friend Miss Myrtle Morrison Mr. Waterman . ( Introducing ) HENRY ( Bowing ) Miss Morrison . KID ( With pride ) The " head liner " at Keith 's . HENRY Pleased to meet you . KID ( Still introducing ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MYRTLE Good-morning . MRS . WATERMAN Good-morning . MYRTLE I feel like a " Reuben " coming in the back way , but Mr. Sheldon seemed so very much at home I hope you 'll excuse me . BRADFORD ( Advancing ) Quite right . Goodmorning . MYRTLE Good-morning , Doctor . BRADFORD May I present Miss Kitteridge ? MYRTLE How are you ? BRADFORD Miss Kitteridge is the lady who was in Mr. Sheldon 's automobile last night when  --   --  MYRTLE ( Freezing up . To BRADFORD ) Yes , I 've heard  --  ( To ESTELLE ) Do you know Mr. Sheldon pretty well ? ESTELLE I ca n't say that I do ! I 've met him only occasionally here when he has come to  --  to assist Doctor Bradford . KID ( With anxious honesty ) Just as I tell you , Myrtle . ( To others ) We came in the back way really , to see them two mattresses  --  she thought the whole story was a steer . You know that ring I lost wrestling with you , Doctor ? ( Steady gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I do n't remember it . ( Pause ) . KID smiles tolerantly ) Do I ? KID Of course you do . Two rubies and a pale sapphire . BRADFORD I remember the ring  --  Oh , yes . KID Well  --  I lost it wrestling out there with you . BRADFORD Oh . KID And coming through the grass this morning there it was  --  Myrtle saw it herself . Show it to them Myrtle . MYRTLE ( To all ) Oh , yes  --  just there by the railing  --  but now really , would any girl swallow that story  --  at first ( Then to KID ) And you know yourself Kid you 've handed me a few with alfalfa on ' em  --  ( Slowly  --  to ESTELLE ) Did  --  you  --  tell  --  him you wanted an automobile to take flowers to sick people ? KID ( Quickly ) I did n't say she said so , Myrtle  --  that was just my guess at a minister 's lady . ( To BRADFORD ) Did n't you tell me , Doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor ? p. 174 BRADFORD Yes  --  practically that . KID ( Vindicated ) I have to prove everything I tell that girl . ( To JUDGE ) Did n't I say " Myrtle Morrison " to the sergeant last night ? JUDGE You did . KID ( To MYRTLE plausibly ) I do n't want my name in the papers with any woman 's but yours . ( Sees that MYRTLE is regarding the JUDGE fixedly ) This is Judge Bates  --  our lawyer  --  ( Pause ) What 's the matter ? MYRTLE Oh ! Judge Bates ! ( Pause ) I thought I 'd seen him some place . Do n't you remember you collected some money that was due me  --  at New Haven ? JUDGE Perfectly . MYRTLE ( To KID ) When I was with Rice . ( To JUDGE ) I was Sissy Crevecoeur on the bills at that time , but my friends thought that was kind of " ten , twenty and thirt " so I changed it . And you 're the lady that was with Kid in the choo choo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to be in court this morning . p. 175 JUDGE Yes , and it 's time now . MYRTLE Just time ? JUDGE Yes . MYRTLE Then wait awhile . It will only help our entrance . ( Pause ) You know I 'm going in your place . ESTELLE ( Gladly ) Oh , are you ? MYRTLE Yes . BRADFORD ( To JUDGE ) Is that possible . MYRTLE Of course it 's possible . Kid 's seen the policeman and squared it with him and who else knows the the difference  --  and I 'm to be interviewed for the evening papers . I 'm going to get a doctor 's certificate for nerves and cut out to-day 's matinee . Do n't you worry about me , Miss Kitteridge , I like it . MRS . WATERMAN It 's very amiable of you , I 'm sure , Miss  --  Miss ( Pause ) MYRTLE ( To MRS . WATERMAN ) Morrison ! Not at all . BRADFORD ( To JUDGE ) But your personal promise to produce the lady herself . JUDGE Miss Morrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the lady 's name . p. 176 KID Certainly  --  I was laying pipe for this last night . MYRTLE ( To ESTELLE ) Did you see Henry Miller in " The Only Way " ? ( ESTELLE shakes her head ) Did you ? ( To MRS . WATERMAN ) MRS . WATERMAN No  --   --  MYRTLE Lots of people missed it  --  but it was elegant . He takes another man 's place that 's goin ' to be killed  --  He looked so much like the other one that the policeman did n't know him . Oh , I just wished I was a man and could have one chance at that part ; and now if I take your place this morning , it 's the same business exactly . I 'm afraid it sounds selfish and of course I do n't mean it , but we 'd have appeared in a much more important Court room , if Kid killed the man . ( Enter LUMLEY . ) LUMLEY ( Seriously ) Judge Bates are you quite sure it 's necessary to  --  ( Pauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) KID Why , you 're downstairs , ai n't you ? LUMLEY ( Slowly and with disapproval ) Oh , Sheldon , Miss Fulton has told me fully that  --   --  p. 177 BRADFORD ( Interrupting  --  to KID ) Miss Fulton is the lady Mr. Lumley introduced to you last night as his fiancee . ( Then to LUMLEY ) Mr. Sheldon can now reciprocate , Reginald  --  this young lady Miss Crevecoeur  --  ( The name strikes LUMLEY ) LUMLEY Morrison now . ( LUMLEY recognizes her . ) BRADFORD Yes  --  Morrison now  --  this is Mr. Sheldon 's fiance . LUMLEY ( Slowly ) Oh  --  oh  --  How are you ? MYRTLE ( A bit nastily ) How are you ? BRADFORD You 've probably seen Miss Morrison frequently , being an old theatre goer . LUMLEY Yes  --  the face is familiar . BRADFORD And perhaps the manner ? Miss Morrison is doing us all a great service , Reginald , She is going to take the place of the lady in the automobile with Mr. Sheldon  --  ( Pause ) JUDGE ( Pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRADFORD Yes  --  and elsewhere . KID ( With meaning ) I appreciate what you 're doing in keeping still , Mr. Lumley . BRADFORD ( To MYRTLE who does n't understand ) This is the gentleman you ran over . MYRTLE Him ! ( BRADFORD nods . MYRTLE gurgles is glee  --  as the rather " evens up " things ) KID ( Extending hand ) Shake ? ( Pause as LUMLEY does not respond ) BRADFORD ( Persuading ) Let 's all have some " charity , " Reginald . KID You know I never even met you till last night . BRADFORD And then informally  --  come Reginald . It is n't as if it were an ordinary scorcher : " The best man in the world in his class " . LUMLEY ( With impulse ) You 're right . ( Takes hand ) And I do n't blame her  --  we 're none of us angels . ( Exit ) JUDGE Well , it 's time now , is n't it ? p. 179 MYRTLE Yes . ( Starts up ) KID Will you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a cab . There are those papers , Doctor . ( KID and MYRTLE to back door . ) BRADFORD Thank you . JUDGE ( To HENRY and MRS . WATERMAN ) I 'll ' phone the decision , Henry . HENRY Here or the office ? JUDGE Here . ( Exit I R. ) MYRTLE If the Kid do n't win it 'll be the first decision he ever lost . BRADFORD Judge Bates is usually successful . ( MYRTLE shrugs doubtfully . ) KID One of the biggest lawyers in New York . MYRTLE ( Regretfully ) I know ; but if we only had Abe Hummell . ( Exit with KID . As KID closes door more glass falls  --  MRS . WATERMAN winces . ) HENRY Never mind , Mattie , I 'll get you a new one . MRS . WATERMAN A new one . That was three hundred years old . p. 180 HENRY ( Sitting ) Is the coffee cold ? MRS . WATERMAN Yes . ESTELLE ( Taking pot ) I 'll get some more . MRS . WATERMAN No , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at BRADFORD ) Why should n't I ? BRADFORD ( Taking the coffee pot from her ) May I tell them ? ESTELLE If you wish . BRADFORD Estelle has promised to be my wife . MRS . WATERMAN ( Half pleased and half astonished ) Why , Cliff ! BRADFORD Yes . ( Puts arms about ESTELLE ) ( ANN appears opening back door and dressed to leave . ) ANN My lands ! ( Shuts the door  --  Exit  --  more glass falls  --  MR. and MRS . WATERMAN start at the clash )
