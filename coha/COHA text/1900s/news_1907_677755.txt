txt The Engineering News editorkally discusses the Quebec Bridge accident , the writer having studied the debris upon the spot for several days before reaching his conclusions . The profession , he declares , is stunned by the disaster , because " altogether the erection work at Quebec has been carried on more scientifically , more accurately , and more safely than in any other bridge structure ever erected . " This being so , it follows that the collapse , notwithstanding all this care , overthrows certainty and undermines confidence . For the profession as well as for the public Such a grievous blow at tfiat public confidence which is the Fide pride I and asset of engineers is an almost incalculable loss . The editor of The Engineering News reviews only to reject all previous causes of bridge failures . There was no defect of material discovered , and no defect of design tested by the highest knowledge of the art . Nor was there any inefficiency in the execution of the design . The conclusion is that " the initial cause of the wreck appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor arm of the cantilever . " The possibility of this is attributed to the confession that " our knowledge of the actual limits of safe stress on long steel columns of exceptional size is by no means perfect . " This being so , doubt rests upon the margin of safety in every great bridge structure . In this particular case the doubt centres in the design of the enormously long lower chord and vertical columns . One of them , apparently the ninth lefthand bottom chord , failed under stresses less than half of the elastic strength of the material composing it . The material was good , but engiI neers are forced to the confession that they are imperfectly informed as to its behavior in the units into which it is worked . Fortunately , if the word can be used in this connection , we are to have the benefit of this sad experience in the bridge of similar design now rising across the East River . Its designer has been designated to study the Quebec accident , and it is not too late to profit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
