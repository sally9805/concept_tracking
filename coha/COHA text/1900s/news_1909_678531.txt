txt Glenn H. Curtiss 's Aeroplane Makes , Two Fine Straightaway Flights and Circles Morris Park Track . Marred by but one accident , which caused the hearts of thousands of , spectators to jump up into their throes , the fire public exhibition and tournament of the Aeronautic Society at Morris Park yesterday afternoon was pronounced by aeronauts one of the most successful events of the kind ever held in this country . More than 5,000 people gathered at the track during the afternoon , and the scene in the grand'stand reminded spectators of the old racing days , for not alone were the seats well filled , but the paddock and lawn were crowded with people . From 1 o'clock on until S the air was filled with flying apparatus of all kinds from the ordinary kite of the small boy to the aeroplane invented and operated by Glenn H. Curtiss . There was to have been an airship contest , but the big dirigible balloon of the society . was put out of commission in the storm of Friday evening , and it was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be postponed until next Saturday : " Balloonaties " in the Air . The first event on the programme was designated as a " balloonatics ' obstacle rate , " in which the contestants were fastened to a light balloon and made to run and jump over obstacles while the balloon pitched and tossed them in the air . Those who took part in this event were George Bold , A. 0 . Danielson , J. M. Fisher , Dr. William Greene , A. E. Horn , George A. Lawrence , ' and J. C. B. Storrs . It was declared a draw . Much interest was taken In the mancarrying kite of-Israel Ludlow and in the towed flights of the gliders . Gliders are mammoth kites capable of lifting the weight of a man who is . supposed to guide them while they are being pulled through the air at a rapid rate by an automobile . It was in the ' first of these events that , the accident , which sent a thrill through the spectators , occurred. , William H.-'Dartin had taker ( his seat fir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traOlt , and a high-powered .. automobile= ? was ** - thfOoPe. ? . *:Mr .

There was a , shout and ' a hurrah irdin the-crowd , and then . a , sudden hush , as it was seen that sonlething had happened that was not intended . The glider was seen to pitch and toss in the , air from one side of the track to the other , and then - it took a sudden dive into the fence . For a moment every one thought that Mr. Martin must surely have been killed , so swiftly , was his glider going . It struck the ground arid went entirely through the , paling fence , ' smashing the machine corhpletely to pieces , ? Mr. Martin lay still for a moment ; then he crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bruises to remind him of his narrow escape from death . The machine was wrecked and ' carried from the field in pieces . Curtiss Machine a Real Flier . The most sensational real flying of the afternoon was that of , Glenn . H. Curtiss , who made two straightaway flights ' and . one circle of the track . Mr. Curtiss 's Machine was especially well tuned.up , and he found the air conditions as near perfect as they should have been according to his ideas . He placed his aeroplane at the south end of the track and started his . engines going . The propellers revolved with great rapidity , and the machlne , shot ahead on its wheels for about 150 yards , when it rose gracefully in the air and ' moved on like a bird for 1,000 yards , when Mr. Curtiss brought it to the ground with perfect , ease . Later on in the evening . Mr. Curtiss accomplished something that he had never before attempted . He placed his machine in position at the north end of the track with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even his most optimistic friends who had watched his experiments ' doubted that he would be able to accomplish this , but he did it . He rose in the air 100 feet after his machine had started , and came down the home stretch at the rate of about 40 miles an hour like a boat . on an even keel . When he reached the grand ' stand ' he commenced to turn , and by the time he reached the clubhouse he was half turned , and then , he cut across the back field and upon the backstretch until-he was within a hundred ' yards of his starting point , when he ' brought his machine to the ground , showing that/he had it under perfect control . Mr. Curtiss 's machine , which was MI vented by himself , is a hi-plane .. The surface have 20 feet spread , 41J , feet from front to rear , with the same distance between . There are only 260 square . feet of supporting surface , and the weight , in4iiding the aviator , is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' the surfaces are made of Baldwin rubber silk stretched to the tightness of a drumhead . There Is a horizontal control surface containing 24 square feet , placed 10 feet in front of the main planes , and smaller adjustable horizontal surface 10 feet in the rear . Stability is secured by movable surfaces at either extremity of the main planes , each surface being half within the main cell and half without . The operator sits just in front of the main planes , the radiator and engine being in his rear . The machine is controlled - by means of a steering wheel Placed directly in front of the aviator . Pushing out or pulling in the wheel steers theiriachine up or down . Turning the wheel right or left steers in the same directions .
