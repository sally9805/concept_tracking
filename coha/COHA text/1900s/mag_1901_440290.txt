run most noted achievement of one of our leading comedians , to which allusion was made in my article of last month , ? the Lord Dundreary of E. A. Sothern , the elder , ? is peculiarly worthy of remembrance and of being freshly recalled to the minds of all who witnessed the performance . I am inclined to believe that the records of the theatre furnish no parallel with the experience of the actor and the public in respect of this impersonation . Mr. Sothern was a player of ability , recognized in his profession , before lie became celebrated . The received story concerning the original production of Tom Taylor 's Our American Cousin appears to be substantially true . The manager was very anxious for the triumph of the new play , hoping for a reestablishment of prosperity upon the basis of its success , and , in order to increase the strength of a very strong cast , purchased the reluctant consent of Mr. Sothern to accept the unimportant part of a stage fop by giving him full leave to " gag ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assigned text with new matter of his own interpolation . Out of this acceptance and this license a unique histrionic product was evolved . Even at the first representations of the comedy the public eye and ear were taken and filled with Mr. Sothern 's extraordinary action and speech , and the other chief players , of whom several ranked with the best in the country , in spite of their cleverness and the greater significance of their parts , found themselves relegated into the background . The scheme and perspective of the author were much impaired , indeed almost inverted as in a moment . It was something as if Osric had pushed himself in front of Hamlet . And no one was more surprised than Mr. Sothern himself . Whence the actor derived the outside of his impersonation I have not been informed . Its substratum was the conventional dandy of the theatre , of course , ? one of the foolishest and unrealest of fictions , ? and Continental Europe had evolved a caricature of the traveling Britisher which adumbrated Mr. Sothern 's make-up ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the actor . I think lie must have encountered somewhere an Englishman whose whole dress , speech , and manner displayed the courage of a monstrous eccentricity . Here , at all events , was a bird of a new feather , ? of a new variety , species , genus . Who that looked upon the noble lord can ever forget the glare of his monocle , and the riga play of the muscles that held the glass in place ; the corrugations of his anxious brow ; the perpetually varied movements of his lips and chin as he struggled to utter himself ; the profuse hair of the period ; his long , silky whiskers ; the hop-andskip walk , ? that gait which was not of " Christian , pagan , nor man ; " his talk , in which a combined lisp , stutter , and stammer , punctuated by quaint gurgles and chuckles , made an unprecedented novelty in human vocalism ; and the long , sumptuous coats and dressing gowns and amplitudinous trousers which he affected ? The whole thing came close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare gifts in drollery and vivacious intensity was accepted , freely and with a delicious sense of immersion in a new kind of fun , by the whole public , gentle and If Mr. Sothern had gone no further than to produce the strange figure which has been partially described , and to make it effective for mirth , the event would have deserved only a mere mention . But he proceeded , with processes and results like those of creative genins , to broaden and deepen his conception , until his Lord Dundreary , without any loss , or rather with an increase , of his comicality , came to have a definite individuality , and to exemplify certain common weaknesses and limitations , which cause the brightest of us acute misery at times , but in him were chronic and the source of continual discomfort . The nobleman 's text and business were enlarged fourfold , and the rest of the play was proportionally reduced . The developed Dundreary was occasionally asinine , but he was by no means the idiot that the crowd had at first imagined him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the noble lord had a mind of his own , ? peculiar , but real , capable of clearness , capable even of penetration and astuteness , but cursed with a tendency to err in dealing with the surface resemblance of things . Life was a muddle by reason of these recurring likenesses , and language was a pitfall or a labyrinth . It was a genuine grief and trial to him , though very amusing to the spectators , when he came upon another of " those things that no fellah can find out , " His weakness was carried to the point of farcical extravagance , but there Was something to sympathize with when he was most ridiculous , and one had new visions both of the inherent weakness and the latent capacities of our language when he said , with eager hitches and emphatic bursts , to Lieutenant Vernon : " Of course you can pass your examination ; what I want to know is , can you go through it ? " Closely allied to this mental infirmity , and another DUNDREARY A CONVINCING PERSONALITY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than " a definite individuality , " in the phrase just now used ; he passed into a genuine and convincing personality . He was a true product of invention and synthetic art , 492 Reminiscences of a Dramatic Critic . and even his extreme eccentricities were soon accepted as innate , unconscious sineerities , not as conscious affectations . The noble gentleman grew to be lovable , and the quaint conjunction in him of eager good nature with nervous irritability proved to be a source of charm as well as mirth . Extraordinary were the variously combined expressions of complaisance , stupidity , humor , and acuteness which flitted over his countenance , and the diversity of intonations which finely indicated the proportions of Isis much-mixed emotions was wonderful . A page might be filled with descriptions of his different smiles ; the broad , effulgent smile which filled his face when he thought he had struck a brilliant conversational idea , and his dubious , tentative , come-and-go flicker of a grin when he was feeling his mental way , being two striking examples in the vast variety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often overpowering , and made the spectator fairly gasp and choke , as two contrary currents of mirth suddenly poured into the unprepared brain . I think the funniest small thing I ever noted at a theatrical performance was his delivery of one of Dundreary 's speeches in connection with Sam 's " letter from America . " The passage began , " Dear Bwother , " Mr. Sothern reading the opening words of the epistle ; then lie made one of his pauses , and , with a characteristic click and hitch in his voice , commented , - " Sam always calls me his bwother ? because neither of us ever had a sister . " Left without further description , the phrase might pass with the reader as rather droll ; but on the words " because neither of us ever had a sister " the actor 's voice became instantly saturated with mock pathos , and the sudden absurd demand for sympathy reached the amazed auditor with soul-tickling effect . deleted material 494 Reminiscences of a Dramatic Critic . in order that the suppleness required in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as a result of the application of this rule , nearly all the great body of actors are devoid of general academic and scholastic training . ' Their culture is the culture of their own private study , worked out in the greenroom and on the stage . It is marvelous what acquisitions many of them make with such handicaps ; but their general narrowness of mental vision may be inferred . Practically out of relation , then , with the social , political , and religious life of the entire rest of mankind , immersed in the unreal realities of the mimic life , driven both by natural impulse and by professional competition to whet their talent to the sharpest edge , the guild of actors is the most charming , na ? f , clever , contracted , conventional , disorderly , sensitive , insensible , obstinate , generous , egotistic body in the world , and ?

They hold to their traditions like North American Indians , and their conventions have the perdurable toughness of iron . Be the thing bad or good , once it is firmly fastened upon the theatre , it sticks indefinitely . The stage fop , now almost obsolete , was a survival , probably , from the period of the Restoration , and drawled and strutted over the boards for hundreds of years after he had disappeared from society . Yet actors are distinguished by plasticity . That they succeed as well as they do in reproducing the contemporary life which they see only by snatches is little short of a miracle , and demonstrates the extreme speed and delicacy in observation of some of them , and the large imitative gift of others , together with a power of divination , which is an attribute of genius . Through the operation of natural selection , they are practically birds of a feather , and the most docile and intimate layMan never quite learns their language or long feels at home in their company . That it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actor should be less a stranger to his fellow men is obvious ; and also it is obvious that , to the end of the world , success upon the stage will involve in the successful artist a peculiar attitude of mind , a peculiar adaptability of temperament , and a rare singleness of devotion , which must separate him from the laity . Comparative isolation will always be a condition of high achievement in the histrionic profession , and the stage will always have a climate and an atmosphere of its own , with which the thermometers and barometers of the outer world will have no immediate relation . CHARLES FECIITER AND HIS EUROPEAN CAREER . During the season of 1869-70 Charles Fechter played for the first time in the United States , appearing first in New York , and opening , in March of the latter year , at the Boston Theatre as Hamlet . He was born in London , in 1824 , and was the son of an Englishwoman and Jean Maria Fechter , a sculptor , who was of German descent , but a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Fechter was wholly French in his affiliations and sympathies , loathed Germany and all its ways , works , and words , and was careful to pronounce " Fayshtair " his surname , the first syllable of which Boston , because of its extreme culture , persisted and persists in giving with the North Teutonic guttural . In his early childhood Ile was taken to France , where he grew up , and , after dabbling for a short time in the clay of the sculptor , studied for the stage , and at the age of twenty appeared successfully , in Le Mari de la Veuve , at the Theittre Francais , of whose company he afterwards became jeune premier . In Paris he attained a great reputation , // though he was often censured for his audacious disregard of the conventions of the classic drama . He had had a polyglot education , and early acquired a good knowledge of English , which he taught himself to speak fluently and with a generally correct accent , though it was impossible for him quite to master the intonations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile assailed London , playing Ruy Blas in English at the Princess 's Theatre . His success was signal , and for ten years as a star he made England his firmament , also holding the lease of the Lyceum Theatre from 1862 to 1867 . He was sped on his transatlantic way by the praise of most of the critical journals of the great metropolis , and by the warm eulogium of his friend Charles Dickens . His complete abandonment of England for this country tends to prove that he had outworn the best of his favor in the British Isles . PECHTER 'S HAMLET IN NEW YORK AND BOSTON . In New York Fechter 's interpretation of Hamlet was greeted with a chorus of disapproval , broken by emphatic praise from several high sources , and his innovations upon received traditions as to the outer particulars of the performance were the subject of much disparagement . The public , however , were keenly interested in all his work , especially in his assumptions of Roy Blas , Claude Melnotte , and other romantic characters . I thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded to were matters of leather and prunella . Fechter 's reasoning that Hamlet was a Dane , and that Danes are fair , with the practical conclusion that he played the Prince of Denmark in a blond wig , seemed to me of no import either for praise or blame ; and as long as he , or another actor , did not defeat the Poet in letter or in spirit , I was willing that he should find , indicate , and manipulate the pic tures in little of the elder Hamlet and Claudius in any way that suited his taste or convenience . His conception of the melancholy prince was a different matter , and from first to last I held to the opinion that he did not rightly indicate the weaknesses of spirit and temperament with which Shakespeare has chosen to disable his otherwise noblest ideal , for the reproof , correction , and instruction in righteousness of mankind throughout the ages . The general public slid not much concern itself , of course , with questions as to the actor 's fidelity to the dramatist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable sensations excited by Fechter 's vivid and impressive playing . New York , always more closely critical of acting than other American cities , and much influenced , no doubt , by Mr. Winter 's severe con- , sure , held out in many quarters against the new Hamlet . But Boston , manifestly relieved by the change from Edwin Booth 's more conventional and studied , but far more just and intuitive impersonation , incontinently accepted the French artist 's performance , satisfied for the time with its outward and visible charms , its vitality , directness , and fervid sincerity . PECHTER 'S APPEARANCE AND EQUIP-MENT . Mr. Fechter , at this part of his career , was , indeed , an exceedingly fascinating and eloquently appealing actor . He was somewhat handicapped by the plainness of his features and the bluntness of his figure ; but his gift in facial expression was varied , and his countenance , at moments of stress , readily took on majesty or strength , sometimes delicate spiritual beauty . His voice was rich and sweet , and easily capable of emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign intonations were numerous , as has been implied , and were very funny when mimicked ; but , while he was acting , he so possessed 496 Reminiscences of a Dramatic Critic . his auditors that they seldom found opportunity to be amused . Personally , I have generally felt , and often expressed , a distaste for broken English on the stage , and I regard the easy-going toleration of the imperfect speech of alien actors us one of the signs of the rawness of our public . Fechter 's failings annoyed me less , however , than those in this kind of other foreigners ; and , after a time , I even learned to tolerate the queerest of his blunders , probably because they seldom took the shape of faulty emphasis . Several important and common words he never mastered ; even " love " ? the verbal talisman , treasure , pabulum , and sine qua noes of the comedian ? he pronounced in a mean between loaf and leave , to the end of his career . But with the appearance of Fechter American audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts and Continental training , who used the English language at his performances . In many ways the experience was a revelation . Here was the culture of the Com6die Frangaise , conveyed through the vernacular , and not under the immense disadvantage of exposition in a foreign tongue . One could see , as Fodder played , the potency of abundant but perfectly appropriate gesture , the action fitted to the very word , the word to the action , according to Hamlet 's prescript ; the trained aptitude for rapid transitions of feeling ; the large freedom of movement ; the ease and force of style which seemed spontaneous and unstudied , when most refined . After an experience of Fechter in tragedy or romance , one returned to our great native artists , and found them , by contrast , rather cool and starchy . FECHTER 'S SUCCESS IN ROMANTIC PARTS . IIIS RUY BLAS . Nature , which had definitely , though not meanly , limited Mr. Fechter on the higher side of the intellect , had en- dewed him with a temperament of rare sensibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamlet aright , I doubt if he would have found it possible to embody his conception . Hamlet sometimes seems to be doing , and , when he is only marking time , tries to make believe that he is marching . I imagine that Fechter could not have contrived to import into the part of the prince that tentative , indecisive quality which characterizes Hamlet 's love for talking and thinking , and his disinclination for persistent doing , which is made only plainer by occasional unpremeditated acts of violence . His Hamlet 's feet were planted firmly on the earth ; and his head was six feet above them , ? not in the clouds , where Shakespeare put it . But when the matter in hand was one of clear romance ; when youthful love , or the power of loyalty , or the spirit of daring was to be exemplified ; indeed , when any common passion was to be shown in any usual way , Mr. Fechter 's playing was eminently effective . As Buy Blas , his bearing in his servile attire at the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep pride without arrogance , the simplicity of a great , unsuspicious nature . His first revelation of his passion for the queen awakened profound sympathy ; and in his interview with Don Cmsar , wherein one noted the manly affectionateness of his love for his friend , the actor 's power of intensity of utterance and of swift transitions of feeling had remarkable illustration : at one moment his heart 's secret rushed forth as if it could not be stayed ; and in the same breath he checked himself in a spasm of self-disgust at his folly , with a half-mournful , half-humorous gesture of deprecation , but only to be swept away again by the torrent of feeling that must relieve itself by speech . In the great final act the actor 's manifold power attained its maximum . Through his soliloquy , dark with his own woe , deleted material A CURIOUS MISTAKE OF A SHAKE-SPEAREAN TEXT . I deem it worth while to record a curious passage in one of the very few talks I had with Mr. Pechter , because the quoted words will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is using a foreign language will make some grievous blunder in handling a classic of that language , in spite of his pains and industry . I was so foolish as to get into an argument with the actor concerning his theory of Hamlet , which 1 attacked on lines already indicated . Mr. Pechter defended his conception , and declared that the prince did not procrastinate , but pursued his task with vigor . Quotations flowed freely , and I was about to clinch my argument by citing the words of the Ghost at his second appearance to Hamlet , when the actor interrupted me . " Now , " he said , " what can you answer to this , , Mr. Clapp ? Do you not recall the words of Hamlet 's father in the queen 's closet , I come to wet thy almost blunted purpose ' ? " That inquiry ended the discussion . It was plain that Mr. Fechter had never distinguished " whet " from " wet , " and that he had no notion of the force of " blunted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " wet " down , and so reduce , the excessive flame of Hamlet 's zeal . In a few emphatic words I wish to bear testimony to the merits of Miss Carlotta Leclercq , who supported Mr. Fechter , and afterwards went on a starring tour in this country , playing a great variety of parts , both in comedy and tragedy , with admirable intelligence , vigor , and taste . MR . FECHTER 'S DECADENCE . Mr. Pechter 's decline was melancholy . It seemed to date from his engagement as leading actor and general manager of the Globe Theatre , of which Mr. Arthur Cheney was proprietor . In the autumn of 1870 Mr. Fechter entered upon this part of his career . Miss Leclercq accompanied him as leading lady , her brother Arthur being stage manager and of the company . Mr. James W. Wallack was engaged as second leading man . Monte Cristo was brought out by the new corps , successfully and with much splendor , on the 14th of September , and ran eight weeks . Then Mr. Fechter presented many characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ability ; and the public appetite for his product displayed signs of abatement . Next came internal discords , which grew chiefly out of Mr. Pechter 's impetuous temper and his inability to get on with American actors and employees . With scarcely any warning to the public , a rupture took place , and on the 14th of January , 1871 , in Buy Blas , he appeared in the Globe Theatre for the last time . During several sequent years , after one return to England , he acted in many American cities . Gradually his powers began to fail , and his engagements were made with second-rate theatres . It was pitiful to see the waning of his strength , indicated by lapses into rant , and by the development of slight mannerisms into gross faults . One of his clever devices had been the use of brief pauses for effect ; now the pauses were lengthened out till they became ridiculous . It is probable that growing physical disability accounted for this decadence . In 1876 he broke his leg , and retired from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died on the 5th of August , 1879 . I have known only one other case of gradual histrionic disintegration in the deleted material 500 Reminiscences of a Dramatic Critic . discern the extraordinary variety of treatment which Shakespeare 's creations , because of their many-sided humanness , will permit . I have seen him play Shylock , sometimes as a fierce money-catching old-clothes dealer of Jewry ; sometimes as a majestic Hebrew financier and lawgiver ; sometimes , at his full maturity , in what I suppose to be the just mean between the two extremes : and the Jew was terrible , vital , convincing , in every aspect . I witnessed the advance in his impersonation of Richelieu , whose theatricalism he succeeded in interpreting in terms of fiery sincerity , until the cardinal was equally imposing in his wrath and fascinating in his shrewdness and amiability . The changes in his conception of Iago were peculiarly noteworthy , the movement being almost steady from lightness in tint and texture to darkness and weight . His early Iago was a gay , jocund , comfortable villain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the litheness and swiftness , the grace and ominous beauty , of a leopard , to which , indeed , in attitude and action , he bore a physical resemblance . His last Iago showed a vast deepening and broadening of the artist 's idea . The subtile Venetian , still as persuasively frank in speech and manners , as facile and graceful , as before , now threw a shadow of baleful blackness as he walked , was Prince of the Powers of the Air as he wove and cast the dreadful " net that should enmesh them all , " and in his soliloquies uttered such a voice of unquenchable anguish and hate as might proceed from the breast of Satan himself . Mr. Booth 's assumption of King Lear I put at the head of all his performances . The tragedian , as the " child-changed father , " showed , I thought , a loftier reach of spirit , a wider and stronger wing of imagination , a firmer intellectual grasp , than he displayed else where , even in the other great assumptions more frequently associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physical basis for the part as Salvini is to be conceded ; but Mr. Booth 's Lear had been wrought into as pure a triumph of mind and soul over matter as the most idealistic critic could wish to see . Without extravagance of action or violence of voice , without extreme effort , indeed , of any sort , the chaotic vastness of Lear 's nature , the cruel woe sustained through the ingratitude of his daughters , the fullness of his contrition over his own follies and his rejection of Cordelia , the moral splendors which illuminate the darkness of his insanity , and the sweet anguish of his restoration to clearness of mind and to gentleness of thought , word , and deed , ? all these were grandly exhibited . The progress of mental decay in the king was indicated with consummate skill , Booth 's interpretation of the whole of the third act being a lesson to the profession in the art of picturesque effectiveness without overelaboration . In the final scenes with Cordelia the tragedian reached his highest point . Mr. Booth 's ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exquisite and poignant , the dryness which sometimes marred his efforts in this kind being replaced by suavity and warmth , like those of an April rain . Mr. Booth 's limitations were obvious . He had little success in straight lovemaking ; in some few seconds of his dialogues with Ophelia , the passion of Hamlet 's love was mixed with a spiritual pain and unrest , which somehow heightened every tenderness of action and utterance . Like his father , and all his father 's other sons , he had small gift in mirth . It was therefore of interest to note that his Petruchio , Benedick , and Don Cmsar de Bazan were almost sufficient , by virtue of his vivacity , fire , and mental alertness , and , in the case of the last two characters , by the elegance and distinction of his manners and speech . // every human creature . But the bark of Hamlet 's misfortunes is borne upon a current whose dark waters flow from the undiscovered country . Macbeth questions with witches and is visited by ghosts , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own making . To Hamlet , by the conditions of his life and his soul , is given the largest opportunity for choice , and the smallest power of choosing . Mr. Booth , with careful and scrupulous art and full success , attempted thus to distinguish the Prince of Denmark from all the rest of the world . His eyes , after the fourth scene of the first act , never lost the awful light which had filled them as they looked upon his father 's ghost ; his voice never quite lost the tone which had vibrated in harmony with the utterances of that august spirit . After all , there is a fine fitness in that closeness of association between Edwin Booth and Hamlet the Dane , which is to abide as long as the man and his art and his life are remembered . In his largeness and sweetness , his rare delicacy and sensibility , he was nobly human to the core , after the pattern of the most human of all the creations of the Poet . Like the melancholy prince , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold his peace when his heart was almost breaking ; and , in its extraordinary depths and reserve , his soul , even as Hamlet 's and as Milton 's , " Was like a star , and dwelt apart . "
