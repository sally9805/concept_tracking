txt Howard Maxwell , ex-President of the Borough Bank and the International Trust Company , who numbered his friends ? by the thousand before his indictment last week , but who was deserted in his hour ' of - need by the men he had helped in his - prosperity , committed Suicide yesterday at his home in Brooklyn by cutting 4is throat and wrists . He died at 5:45 o'clock last night at the Long Island College Hospital . All the wealth which all one time put him in the front rank of Brooklyn 's wealthy men was gone . VMS , ' practically penniless . Even the house whiehhe took his life had been turned . over td the Borough Bank to make ? good the money which had been borrowed to further the financial deals in which ha and William Cow were interested . Mr. Maxwell could have stood the mental strain incident to his troubles , his family says , had his friends stood by him . But in the four days and nights he spent in Raymond Street Jail for want of $20,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the wealthy men - who had once called him friend were not willing to come to his aid . Those days and nights in jail broke down the reserve force which had carried the former ? Bank President through the trying days when the Grand Jury was uncovering the transactions which resulted In the Indictment of ' Mr. Maxwell , William Gow , and Arthur D. Campbell on charges of grand larceny and forgery . Jenkins and Hie Brothers Indicted . The suicide of Mr. Maxwell was not the only development of the day in Brooklyn 's financial troubles . The same Grand Jury which indicted Mr. Maxwell found indictments yesterday against John G. Jenkins , Jr. , President of the Jenkins Trust Company , and his two brothers . Frank Jenkins , President of the Williamsburg Trust Company , and Frederick Jenkins . a Director hi the Jenkins Trust Company . A11 three men were indicted for forgery connected with the loans of $557,000 made to the stock brokerage firm Frank and John G. Jenkins , Jr . The . alleged forgery consisted in making false entries in the loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were members of the stock brokerage firm , and although it was not shown that Frank Jenkins was guilty of making the false entries in the loan hook , he was inr dieted as an accessory to the deed . Ail - three men were arrested . It was while they were being arraigned in the Kings County Court House that Mr. Maxwell took his life . It is thought by those who knew Mr. Maxwell best that the terrible straits in which he found himself caused him to lose his mind , and that he was really insane when he committed suicide . The way he chose to end his life lends strength to this theory . Standing before a mirror in his - bathroom he slashed his throat with a razor . With a small penknife - he cut a LJagged , triangular wound in his left wrist , and with still another razor slashed again at his throat , severing the windpipe and several of the blood vessels . Mr. Maxwell taked over the telephone with some one in Manhattan just before he killed himself . In this telephone conversation Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said , to tide him over his embarrass , . went . He was to meet ths man with ' whom he talked at 4 o'clock . Last Days of Maxwell 's Life . The story of , the last few days of Mr. Maxwell 's life is pathetic in the extreme . From the time he left his home at 182 Congress Street and went to the County Court House , where the Grand Jury was In session on Thursday , the gradual change in the man was apparent . In the years when he was prosperous and recognized as a banker of standing in the community he was one of the most composed men In Brooklyn . But when the detectives at the Court House grabbed him on that Thursday morning and rushed him over to Police Headquarters and photographed him for the Rogues ' Gallery , , his nerve seemed to fail . He could hardly stand when arraigned before Judge Fawcett sto face the charges of forgery and grand larceny . But he did not know at that time he Would have to stay in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to his assistance and furnish the $30,000 bail . But they did not come . His four sisters in Flatbush put up all the property they had . It was only enough to cover one Indictment , $10,000 . It was finally a surety company which brought about the release of the banker . This bore heavily upon Mr. Maxwell . Late Monday night , when his " bail had been obtained , he hurried from the Court House to his home . where his wife , whom he had married only , four years ago , awaited him . What followed that night In the : Maxwell home will probably never be told , for Mrs. Mai-wends prostrated with the horror of it all and can not bear to speak of the tragedy . It is known , however , that Mr. Maxwell retired in the early hours yesterday morning : - after a long talk with his wife . Breatrfast was served . late in the Maxwell home . Mr. Maxwell did not eat . Soon , after noon he rang up a man . In , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been . investigating the case . It was understood -- that ' this New Yorker , however . had . promised Mr. Maxwell financial aid a  --  srnall extent , the talk over the . telephone was brief . li little later the ? telephone again rang and Mr. Maxwell answered it . To whom he talked or on what subject the servants in his home do not know . But the name of Arthur D. Campbell was mentioned It is preeehmed ; that : the talk referred to the confession : Campbell made ; the confession which . was used before the Grand Jury , and  --  Which was largely responsible for the indictments in the Borough Bank case . After this talk over the telephone , Mr. Maxwell went up stairs . Mrs. Maxwell went to her room . A little before 2 o'clock in the afternoon Mrs. Maxwell heard a faint cry from the bathroom . " Carrie , Carrie , " the voice seemed to say , and passed away in a gurgle . Mrs. Maxwell ran to the bathroom . The door was open . Mr. Maxwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gash in his ? throat and another in his wrist . The in- : jured wrist hung limp over the bath tub , and the blood was running into the tub . A scream from Mrs. Maxwell brought a trained nurse and her son-in-law . The nurse had been in the house several days . caring for Mrs. Maxwell , who had been on the verge of a nervous collapse since her husband 's name had been dragged into the Borough Bank scandal . Dorothy Doolittle , a seven-year-old piece of Mrs. Maxwell . was also in the house . She had been with the trained nurse and followed her to the bathroom . She was pushed away before she saw . he ' : hotly . Two- negro servants , a man and , a : woman , who had been on the first floor , also ran upstairs upon hearing Mrs. Max ? asehll 's scream . No word was spoken by - tde wounded man . His eyes were closed and when he opened his mouth to speak blood- appeared upon his lips . Go get a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Maxwell . and the ncgio butler ran to the telephone and called for Dr. Johnson of Joralemon Street , the family physician . He was not at home . The servants were then told to hasten to the office of the nearest physician . The butler ran to the home of Dr. Prederick Pafford at Amity and Clinton Streets . Dr Pafford hastened to the Maxwell home . But before he arrived Dr. T. E. Brown of 27S Clinton Street had already reached there and had gone upstairs . When Dr. Brown entered the bathroom Mr. Maxwell was in a chair . A young man who said he was a son-in-law of the nurse was holding the wounded man 's bead . Doaters Could n't Stop the Bleeding . Brown , after a ' hasty examination , put Mr. Maxwell upon the hall floor , just outside the bathroom . In order to facilitate his breathing : . The injured man was barely conscious . He lapsed into unconsciousness just after Dr. Pafford arrived . Dr. Pafford said later that when he got there he saw an open razor lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath- ! room floor , and a small bone-handled penketife , with a ' blade open at each enda lying near by . All were bloody . " I saw at once - that it was a hospital case , as the man was apparently dying and an operation - would in all probability be necessary to save him , " said Dr. Pafford later in the day . " I tied up the radial artery in b is wrist and staunched the flow of blood as much as possible . " When I arrived Mr. Maxwell 's wounds had almost finisned bleeding . howeveni The blood in she - wounds had congealed . " Dr. Pafford called up the Long Island College Hospital and asked that an ams hulance be sent at once . He was told that ambulance calls would have to come title:ugh the Police Department So Br . Pafford natified police headquarters . The Long Island College Hospital ambulance arrived of the house at 2:15 o'clock Ambulance Surgeon L. F. Mccrea assisted the two physicians in taking Mr. Max-well to the ambulance . While they were removing the wounded man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started to enter the house . He was halted at the door by the ieero butler and told that he must stay out , o-s it was not a case for the police . The policeman was handed a paper bundle in which were the two razors and the penknife , and with these he left . When he returned to the Butler Street station Lieut . Allen , who was in charge , seri ; him back to the Maxwell house with instructions to , see the members of the family and get statements from them But when he : arrived the fee- nt door was fastened by a short length of chain . It opened a little way in response to the policeman 's ring , and the negro butler told him to go awayas he could see no one . Operated On in the Hospital .

It was found that the gash in Mr. It ran from right te left , and was about i two inches deep . All the tendons of his left wrist had been severed and several of the arteries were cut . A number of - stitches were taken in both wounds Mai Maxwell did not recover consciousness . however , and died at 5:45 o'clock lases ' It is thought that Mr. Maxwell started night to shave when he left the telephone down- t stairs and went to the bathroom . When I found he was in his underclothing , as ? though preparing to take a bath , prepara-tory to going out . There was a five days ' growth of beard on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shaved in jaiL In fact , he bad no money to pay a barber . The $3 given him by William Gow as he was being led away to prison after Mr. Gow and Cashier Campbell had obtained their bail bonds and had been released was exhausted on Friday . It is believed that as he stood before the mirror . - preparatory to lathering his face , the full weight of his troubles fell upon him and Lis reason gave way . Only One Friend Cans at House . William S. Hurley , Vice President of the Borough Bank . who was at one time one of the most intimate friends of . Howard Maxwell , learned of the tragedy over the telephone early in the afternoon . lee hastened to Mr. Maxwell 's home , intending to give what comfort he could to Mrs. Maxwell . He found her in a serious condition , with the nurse watching over her . Mr. Hurley was the only former friend and business associate of the unfortunate bank President who called at the Congress Street house in the afternoon . Mr. Maxwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went upon part of his ball bond , were notified over the Belief Openly Expressed That He Was the Tool of Worse Men . While none of his friends attempted to show that his indictment was either un-reasonable or unjust , many Brooklyn men who knew Howard Maxwell well were expressing sympathy for his fate last night . It was fait by these men that while at least not more guilty than others , Maxwell had been made to suffer the most severele- of any of those involved in the bank e. , osures . Friends of the self-slain banker openly voiced the belief last night , though they did not . are to append their names to it , that whets the whole truth became known it would lie found that Maxwell was to no little extant merely a catspaw in the hands of mien who were able to bend hint , to their easel after he had once yielded tot temptation placed in his way .

He was in many reelects a etearler . But his life outside of the bank was exemplary . " Without trying to make it appear the Howard Maxwell was guiltless of the acts he was accused of committing , " said a man who had long been a friend of the banker , " I think it but fair to his memory to say that he was misled at the beginning by men in whom he had the greatest confidence . I really believe that at the first Howard was deceived and that after he became involved he could find no - way of disentangling himself . He was far from being an evil man at heart . Some of the things charged against him seem to have been done more for the advantage of others than for his own perSonal gain . He was a fine example of what is . known in certain circles as a ' good fellow . ' There are many- men in this town who found him a ready listener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who obzained money from him . Several of these I men , wino went to him in time of financial trouble , are now wealthy and on ' easy street . ' Yet it is a strange truth that in the time of his own greatest need , Howard Maxwell , the man of so many friends as a bank President , found him , self deserted by those - who owed him debts ' of gratitude and could have easily helped see LW all the nt en indicted , ** el I was the only one allowed to go to jail . " There were just three things which deove Maxwell to kill himself , and none of these was fear of prison . The first , of corSgse , was the disgrace into which he had cOnse . The other causes were the death of his mother , which occurred shortly after the bank crash , and the ingrathuda of his friends . I believe that Howard planned his own death while in jail . If opportunity had . offered he would undoubtelily have killed himself in his cell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his marriage four years ago to Mrs. Carrie Paine , Maxwell lived with his mother and four maiden sisters in a pretty vine . on Newkirk Avenue , Flatbush . He was a. great lover of mature , particularly of plants and trees and flowers . One of his chief delights in. those days was working in the garden about his home . He made of this garden a. delight to the eye and one of the show places of the district . He took great pride in his flowers and loved to talk about them . telephone of-the tragedy , and /listened to the house. - They were there last night with Mrs. Maxwell . Tile Maxwell home in Congress Street is one of the most pretentious in that part of Brooklyn . It is a big four-story brownstone structure , built ten years ago for Edward M. Shepard . Mr. Maxwell bought it about four years ago . When he turned the deed for the property over to the Directors of the Borough Bank the value of the house and grounds was put at . $30,000 . The house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little church , that of the Second Unitarian Society . Those who are most familiar with the financial affairs of Mr. Maxwell say that ho had expected material aid from William Gow at the time he was indicted . Ht and Mr. Gow had been so closely associated in so many business deals that they were looked upon as inseparable in a business sense . When the International Trust Company was organized by Mr. Gow early in October , Mr. Maxwell was put in the Presidency . But when he was locked up for want of bail , and there was no word from Mr. Gow , Mr. Maxwell , it Is said , was too proud to send word to his former associate to get it for him . Mr. Maxwell was married four years ago . His wife was a widow when he met her , a Mrs. Carrie N. Payne , formerly of Washington , who came to New York about five years ago and for awhilehad a boarding house on the upper west side of Manhattan . Mr. and Mrs. William Gow boarded in her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the advertising firm of Ward &; Gow . They became fast friends . At the same house lived Frank Doolittle , a. brother of Mrs. Payne . Mr. Doolittle eventually became the private secretary of William Gow , and his name has been mentioned several times in the Grand Jury 's investigation of the Borough Bank . Mr. Maxwell 's Career . Howard Maxwell began his career in the financial world in the days of the old Kings County Bank . He entered there as a. clerk . When the Kings County Bank and the Union Bank were merged in 1902 Mr. Maxwell became Cashier . As such he was thrown in contact with the financial men of Brooklyn . His merits were soon recognized . ' When the Borough Bank was organized he was made its President . He was put in the Presidency mainly through the influence of William Gow , one of the largest stockholders . Just before the crash , when the Borough Bank closed its doors and the District Atorney began work on its affairs . Mr. Maxwell was reputed to be worth about $500,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much worried last Thursday by the presence of a strange man in her house , who insisted upon standing at the telephone and answering all who called inquiring about Mr. Maxwell . He is supposed to have been a crank . The man called ate the Maxwell house about ' noon and told Mrs. Maxwell that he represented the legal interests of her husband . There were several calls over the telephone asking if Mr. Maxwell had obtained bail . To all of these the strange man answered : " Oh , that is all right We have got bail for Mr. Maxwell . " After he had been in the house two hours . she asked why he was telling persons Mr Maxwell had obtained bail . " Oh , it is best to tell them that anyhow , to make them easier . " he replied .
