txt Mr. HEARST 'S American uses an entire page to assert a monopoly of opposition to child labor . Those who oppose The American , it says , contend that attacking a system which kills children by thousands is " fomenting Class hatred . " Therefore all who oppose fomenting class hatred oppose The American and its crusade for freedom of children from excessive tasks . The logic is limping , but nevertheless harm will be done if the idea is allowed to go unchallenged . How is child labor to be abolished ? Mere articles in newspapers can only arouse and inform public sentiment . Anything practical must be done by legislation . If it is to be done by Federal legislation then Mr. HEARST is himself to blame , for none of his activities as Representative has been given in defense of child labor . The reason is simple . The Federal Government employs no children , and is powerless to regulate their employment in State industries . But how particularly , foolish it is to raise the question of child labor in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As this month opened a law went into effect forbidding the employment at early or late hours of any child under sixteen in any factory in the State , or in this city in any of many leading classes of employment after 7 P. M. It does not appear that Mr. HEARST or his newspapers have excelled any others in this practical side of the work . On the contrary , they have rather left it to others . Even at the present moment they are laggards in a phase of the %vork which needs support . Although the State has passed a child labor law , it does not enforce itself . The last quarterly bulletin of the State Department of Labor specified Magistrates and employers who were lax in observance of the State 's high standard . Here is a field where The American can work against child labor without the slightest suspicion of fomenting class hatred , and with the approval of everybody . The American 's assumption that opposition to The American 's candidate is the same thing as advocacy of child labor is such nonsense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannct recall any party , or even a single partisan , or party organ , so foolish as to advocate child labor . The issue is a live one only in few States . To raise it locally as part of either the New York or the Congressional campaign is impossible , except by misleading the ignorant into the idea that somebody is opposing what The American supports . This is nelthonest support of the regulation of child labor , but Is fomenting class hatred . There is nothing but sentiment in The American 's strenuous support of what nobody dissents from , and there is a plentiful lack of any practical proposal , such as has been enacted without any conspicuous , help by The American . And yet by vociferation The American may lead labor to think that it is labor 's only friend . This seems to us humorous in a party responsible for Mr. CoNmnns , but we should not expect labor to laugh at the jest .                    @
