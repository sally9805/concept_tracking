IN every period when literature has been distinguished by abundant dramatic production , the playwright will be found to have composed his plays in accordance with the conditions of the actual theater of his own time . He may not have liked these conditions , and he may have believed that they could be bettered , but he has always begun by accepting them , whatever they might be . He has done this necessarily and inevitably , whether he himself was truly a dramatic poet like Sophocles and Shakspere or merely an ingenious stage-craftsman like Kotzebue and Scribe . What the playwright of every age has done instinctively and without hesitation , the historians of literature are now beginning to perceive , and only a few of them have yet grasped the full significance of the fact that it is impossible justly to appreciate the art of the truly dramatic poet , Sophocles or Shakspere , Moliere or Ibsen , without a clear understanding of the chief circumstances of an actual performance in the particular theater for which the dramatist prepared his plays and to the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of his story . It is scarcely too much to say that the dramaturgic methods of Sophocles and of Shakspere , of Moliere and of Ibsen , are only in small part their own or even under their own control . The major portion of their technic is the direct result of the conditions of the particular theater in which every one of them intended to have his plays acted , and which was , indeed , often the only kind of theater he knew anything about . We are now well aware that there have been many kinds of theaters , some of them differing very widely from our snug modern playhouses . We all recognize that the immense outdoor theater of the Athenians was as unlike as possible to the small , half-roofed cockpit of the Elizabethans , and also to the long , narrow tennis-court of the Parisians under Louis XIV . But while these differences between the theaters of different times and different places may be a matter of common knowledge , we do not always apply this information when we undertake to discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the French . We do not see at a glance how important the influence of the theater itself has been and must be on the structure of the play . We do not always keep in mind the way this influence has often dictated to the author what he could put into his play , what he had to leave out , and how he had to present what he desired to set forth . We do not give full weight to the pressure exerted on the playwright by the varying conditions of the playhouses of successive periods , ? by the size of the theater , for one thing , which may be so huge as to forbid the author 's choice of any but broad and simple themes , ? by the elaboration of heavy scenery , which may impose on him the duty of compacting his plot so that he will need few changes of place , or by the improving modes of illumination ( daylight , candles , oil-lamps , gas , and electricity ) , all of which have wrought in turn significant modifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a realizing sense of the influence exerted upon the art of the dramatist by the changing conditions of the various kinds of theaters that have succeeded each other through the long centuries that we can measure the wisdom of Shakspere in rejecting the advice of Sidney to model his plays after those of the Greek dramatists ; and we can gage also the unwisdom of Tennyson in taking Shakspere 's histories as the pattern of his own poetic dramas , composed centuries later , when theatrical conditions had entirely changed . Very rarely have the critics of any special period of the drama been familiar with the conditions existing during any other period . The historians of Greek literature have been acquainted with our modern playhouses , and they are now studying the ruins of the theaters still accessible in Greece and in the Grecian colonies , but they are not acquainted with the methods of presenting plays in the Middle Ages , at first in the churches and later on platforms in the market-places . The historians of English literature are only now coming to have a fairly clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tudors , and they have not yet seized the full significance of the changes which resulted during the Restoration from the introduction of painted scenery and of artificial light . Although Haigh composed a richly illustrated hook about the " Attic Theater " and although Despois described fully the " French Theater under Louis XIV , " no one has yet prepared a satisfactory account of the English theater under Elizabeth , of the Spanish theater of about the same date , or of the English theater from the Restoration to 1830 , when gas was introduced . No one has attempted to tell the whole history of the art of scene-painting , which has had a most intimate connection with the art of the dramatist . The scholars who know only one manifestation of the drama are without the perspective which would be supplied to them by a knowledge of other aspects in other times and in other places . There is a singular unity in the drama throughout the ages , for the aim of the dramatist has always been one and the same , whether he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , or a Scandinavian of to-day . He has always sought to interest the mass of his contemporaries in a story shown in action on the stage and setting forth a clash of contending desires . The differing methods the dramatists have employed at one time or another are to a great extent the consequence of the physical conditions of the actual theaters in which their plays were to be performed , although these methods are affected also by traditions still surviving from the playhouses of an earlier generation . These traditions the dramatist profits by , even if they are no longer in exact accord with the actual conditions of the theater for which he is writing ; and so we find the Elizabethan playwrights making use of two doors on opposite sides of the stage to indicate two wholly distinct places , a device which is apparently a survival from the several " mansions " of the French mystery , when it was acted on a long platform in the open air . In fact , it is impossible really to understand the dramaturgic methods ? in vogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of performance at least half a century earlier . No one , as already noted , has undertaken to trace the slow development of the art of the scene-painter , distinguishing sharply between true scene-painting as we now know it , a realistic perspective intended to reproduce the place itself , and that very different thing , the building up in miniature of the house or of a part of  | the house such as we find in the Middle Ages and again in the Italian comedy-ofmasks . No one has collected the many references which make it plain that properties of all sorts -- altars , thrones , arbors ? were in use long before there was any attempt at true scene-painting . And no one has ever made a collection of plans of theaters , all drawn to the same scale , so that we could see at a glance how immense was the theater of Dionysus at Athens and how petty the tennis-court wherein Moliere acted . With the aid of a collection of these plans , and with the collateral information now available , we could follow the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we should be led to one interesting conclusion ? that instead of there being only two types of theater , as is often assumed , the ancient and the modern , there are in reality many , of which the medieval is not the least important . W 'Ve should be induced to acknowledge that the theater in England for which Marlowe and Shakspere and Jonson wrote and the theater in Spain for which Lope de Vega and Calderon wrote , were neither of them really modern . Both were medieval in their methods , or at least semimedieval . We should be made to see that Moliere is apparently the earliest of the moderns , in that his plays now need no readjustment , no editing , no transposing of any kind , to fit them for the playhouses of to-day . And we should discover that a very striking change in the practices of the playwrights was brought about in the second half of the nineteenth century , when the stage was at last abundantly lighted in every part by electricity , and when the curving bow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thereafter rose and fell inside a picture-frame . The difference between the playhouse in which we see a drama of Mr. Bronson Howard 's to-day and the playhouse in which Sheridan 's comedies were originally acted is greater than the difference between Sheridan 's Drury Lane and the house for which Congreve wrote and in which Betterton acted . And that Restoration playhouse was very unlike the Elizabethan theater for which Shakspere wrote and in which Burbage acted . Even more apparent is the difference between the theater of Dionysus at Athens and the Roman theater at Orange . These theaters  | are sharply distinguished from one another by their size , by their shape , by their methods of illumination , by the absence or presence of real scenery , and by the ar rangement of the seats for the spectators and as we study these successive change we are confirmed in the conviction tha these physical conditions must have ex erted a powerful influence upon the drama tists who followed one another down th centuries . The theater of Dionysus at Athens i accepted as the earliest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved that i is possible for a traveler now to sit on it benches and look down into the orchestr where the chorus circled with solemn chant about the altar of the god in whos honor the drama had come into being For a long time the primitive Greek play were acted in the market-place , and th pectators sat on temporary benches . Afte one of these rows of seats had broke down , a space was leveled at the foot of the Acropolis , and the spectators grouped themselves on the hollow hillside above . In time the slope was rounded out , and , from the level space where the actors stood , tiers of marble seats rose high up the shoulder of the mountain . The orchestra was paved with marble , and some kind of low structure must have been erected behind the semicircular space of the orchestra to serve as a background for the movements of the actors and for the evolutions of the chorus . It is generally admitted now that there was no stage and the acting took place in this orchestra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming to be admitted also that there was no scenery , although there may have been properties and although the author was free to avail himself of the doors and of the roof of the low structure that shut in the orchestra and which probably served also for a dress- ing-room for all those who took part in the performance . The arc of the semicircle where this structure stood was seventy-two feet , and the farthest point of the semicircle was about the same distance away . Above this level space there rose nearly eighty tiers of seats . It has been calculated that more than twenty-five thousand spectators could be present at a performance . As we sit on those benches to-day and look down to the orchestra and see how small a single figure looks so far away and how impossible it is to perceive any play of feature , we are not surprised that the Greek actors were raised on lofty hoots and wore masks that towered above their heads , increasing their apparent stature . We recognize that under such circumstances the dramatist was wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus accoutered . We perceive that he was well advised when he preferred a plot already familiar to his audience , so that they would not lose the thread of the story even if a sudden gust of wind from the xEgean might now and again deprive them of the spoken words . We can approve also his practical shrewdness in choosing a theme Lot only already known in its outline , but also possessing a bold simplicity , which deLanded a massive treatment . We can understand more clearly the function of the chorus , which supplied both a restful lyrical variety and that spectacular element which appealed to the eye and which seems to be ever requisite to hold the attention of an immense gathering . And we end by seeing an obvious likeness between an old Greek tragedy and one of our larger modern operas , if this should he performed out of doors . In building their pla-houses , as in most of their other artistic endeavors , the Romans followed in the footsteps of the Greeks . They modified the Athenian theater to suit their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which  | enabled the audience to look clown on the actors , they filled the orchestra with benches , and they were therefore forced to raise a stage so that the spectators could see the performers . This stage was a long and narrow shelf , and it had behind it a high mall , pierced with doors and richly decorated with columns and statues . This stately piece of ornate architecture was the unchanging background for every play , and its doors were utilized as the plot might demand . In the theater at Orange , in the south of France , the stage was about one hundred and ninety feet wide . There were accommodations for six thousand spectators . Although this theater at Orange is a little late , the earlier Roman playhouses were similar in size and in shape . Such a theater seems to be better suited for pantomime and for the feats of acrobats than for a drama dealing truthfully with the pathos and the humor of life . Perhaps we can catch a glimpse of one reason why the delicately polished comedies of Terence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terence 's style could hardly be expected to convey much pleasure in a very large theater of that type . The Comedie-Francaise , on one of its visits to Orange , ventured to perform there a neo-Greek playlet , the " Ilote " of Al . Paul Ferrier ; but although it had been successful in Paris at the Theatre Francais , it was found to evaporate into immediate insignificance in the vast space of the old Roman theater . On the other hand , the " CEdipus " of Sophocles and one or two other French versions of boldly planned Greek tragedies were really more effective when performed at Orange than they had ever been in Paris , as though they demanded a larger frame than any modern theater could provide . In the middle ages the tradition of the Greek and Roman drama seems to have been lost , and we find a new dramatic form evolved spontaneously out of the ritual of the church . Just as the Ara Cceli in Rome still exhibits at Christmas a wax-work reproduction of the infant Jesus cradled in the rude manger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dia- 1 logue and presented in action other episodes of the birth and also of the resurrection . Choristers with shepherds ' crooks in their hands came in by the eastern portal and advanced through the congregation , singing the glad tidings , until they drew near to the manger within the chancel , in front of which they might meet other officials of the church representing the Three Wise Men . Later a place apart was found for Herod and his soldiers ; and here and there in the vast cathedral other places were assigned to other actors in other episodes of Christ 's career ? the temple for one , and the house of the high priest for another . These several places were called " stations . " When the swollen mystery was turned out of the cathedral , and its presentation was undertaken by laymen , the traditions established in the church were carefully preserved , with only the necessary modifications . In a manuscript of a mystery acted in Valenciennes there is a miniature of the stage on which it was acted , and from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea of a medieval performance in France . The stage was a shallow platform about one hundred and thirty feet in length ; and at the back , in a long line , were little houses representing each of the several " stations , " the various places required in the course of the drama . At the extreme right of the spectators is heaven , raised high on pillars , and at the extreme left is hell-mouth . Ranged between were the inn , the temple , the house of the high priest , and the other necessary " mansions , " as the French called them , used only when they were called for by the special episodes of the story , the rest of the acting taking place anywhere on the stage , which was a neutral ground that might at any time be supposed to be any place . In England , instead of massing the stations at the back of a long stage , they were set up separately on wagons , like the floats  | of a mardi-gras parade , and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part of the acting was done not on the floats , but in the street itself , in the midst of the assembled spectators , just as had been the case when the earlier performances were given in the church itself . The street was then the neutral ground which might be supposed to be anywhere ? the shore in front of Noah 's Ark or the space between the palace of Herod and the house of the high priest , which were represented by two pageants brought forward at the same time . This is the tradition which survived in the Elizabethan theater , where the acting also took place on a neutral ground , the stage itself , which was only a platform unincumbered by scenery , and therefore free to represent any needed place , where two doors properly labeled might stand one for Asia and the other for Africa . Under the later Tudors there sprang into being several companies of actors patronized by the great nobles . They went about acting where they could , in palaces and in town-halls , on village greens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties , swords and scepters and the like , but they knew nothing of scenery . When at last they were forbidden to act in the inns of London , they went a little outside the city and put up playhouses of their own . They had no models to go by , for they knew as little about the theaters of Greece and Rome as their medieval predecessors had known ; but they had found that the courtyards of inns , hollow rectangles girt with galleries , were suitable for their purpose , and so it is that the playhouses that they built were very like the inn courtyards , with the inn itself omitted . They put up a square or circular or oval structure , open to the sky , except over the galleries and except also over the back part of the platform , which jutted into the yard where the groundlings stood . ' We have the contract for the building of one of these playhouses , from which we learn that it was square , eighty feet on each side , and that the platform-stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted to look like tapestry , was hung from the gallery at the back , where it crossed the platform , and through this the actor made his entrance ; and it could be looped back to reveal a supposed cave or a supposed study , while the gallery above could serve as a balcony , as the outer wall of a castle , or merely as another place from which some character could overhear or oversee what took place on the platform below . The platform-stage , although it had no scenery , was often enriched with properties , ? thrones , arbors , and wells , ? as these might he called for by the story . This platform-stage was the neutral ground whereon any character might meet any other character without any question as to the exact spot where the meeting was supposed to take place . If the action of the play could be made clearer by particularizing the special place , then one of the characters was careful to say where they were supposed to be . But the spectators , some of them seated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors , some of them standing iq the N and on three sides of the platform , and some of them accommodated more comfortably in the private boxes of the galleries , asked no questions about place or time ; they wanted to see a story set forth in all its phases , and they cared nothing to know just where it was that any two characters were supposed to be at the very moment when the plot was thickening to a crisis . The playwrights had the largest liberty of time and place , a larger license than was good for most of the Elizabethan dramatists , who did not compact their plots and who were amply satisfied if they succeeded in interesting their unexacting audiences . And when we contrast this London theater for which Shakspere wrote with the Athenian theater for which Sophocles wrote , we get a glimpse of the gulf that yawns between the English drama and the Greek . We perceive one of the chief causes of the differences between them ; and we see at the same time how distinctly the form of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France the strolling companies had become accustomed not to the courtyards of inns , but to tennis-courts ; and it is in an altered tennis-court that we find Moliere acting more than once . A tennis court was a rectangle of a little less than one hundred feet in length by a little less than forty feet in width . It had galleries along the sides , and it had a solid roof , and therefore it had to be lighted by can- dies . A stage was easily put up at one end , shut in by a proscenium-arch , in which a curtain probably rolled up at the beginning of every act . But here again we have spectators seated on the sides of the stage , not on separate stools , but on benches perpendicular to the footlights ; and again we find the actors more or less surrounded by the audience , as in England and in Greece . Behind these benches there was painted scenery , although this was little more than a drop-cloth . The French dramatists , following Corneille 's example , had accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays , except one , which was a free adaptation from the looser Spanish , he vigor-ously confines all his acts to a single and unchanging scene . It is true that certain of his earlier plays , on the model of the Italian comedyof-masks , were probably performed in a set representing a public square , with houses solidly built of wood on each side , into the doors of which the characters went and from the windows of which they could lean out . This set was familiar to Moliere and to his audiences , as it was that used by the Italian comedians who played in the same theater on alternate nights . And here again we need to know the earlier Italian conditions to understand how it was and why it was that Moliere was able to put on the stage the story of the " School for Husbands , " which , as Voltaire said , seems to be all in narrative , although it really is all in action . In time Ioliere came to dispense with the convenient devices of the Italians ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the case , when the stage was encumbered with spectators . His characters always stand except when chairs are absolutely necessary ; and the action is adroitly arranged so as to be easily presented in a neutral ground ? the narrow space between the spectators on the stage and the painted drop-scene which hangs at the back . This is one reason why his plays can now be performed in any modern theater . They do not need elaborate scenery , but , then , elaborate scenery can be put into them without doing them any harm . To this extent Moliere is in reality the earliest of modern dramatists , since Shakspere 's conditions were at least semi-medieval . Shakspere 's courtyard playhouse was unroofed , and lighted only by the sun , and it had no scenery , whereas Moliere 's tennis-court playhouse was roofed , artificially lighted , and had painted scenery . And Moliere did not always act in a tennis court playhouse . He was allowed to move his company into the stately theater built by Richelieu on the model devised by the Italian architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | still surviving here and there in the penin sula . Palladio had even attempted at Vicenza what he believed to be a repro duction of a Roman theater . Under this Italian influence the tennis-cour playhouse was given up in France as the courtyard playhouse was given up in England ; and everywhere there were erected theaters externally not unlike our modern places of amusement , although in Paris a portion of the audience con tinued to be seated on the stage until the middle of the eighteenth century , and when Voltaire 's " Semiramis " was produced , the ushers had to beg these spectators to yield a passage for the ghost of Ninus . As many of these Italianate theaters were intended to serve also for the perform ance of opera , with its cus tomary spectacle , they were very much larger than the buildings which had been found satisfactory earlier . It was difficult to light the stage satisfactorily with the feeble oil-lamps which were then the only means of illamination . Probably this is one reason why the stage was made to curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain rose and fell . This projecting area between the bow of the footlights and the line of the curtain was called the " apron , " and the hest-lighted central spot was known as the " focus . " It became the habit of the actors to come in front of the proscenium-arch and to present every important moment of the piece out on the apron and as near to the focus as possible , because it was only in that place that there was sufficient light to enable the spectators to perceive their play of feature . This brought them very close to the audience , and they actually turned their backs on the spectators who sat in the boxes nearest to the stage . The old Academy of Music in New York conformed to this type ; and those who remember it . as it was in the third quarter of the nineteenth century may recall the fact that Adelina Patti more than once was caught in front of the curtain as it fell after her final song . They may also recollect how the glare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the boxes nearest to the stage . This was the prevailing type of theater for two centuries after the Restoration ; and there is no better example of it than the Drury Lane , which Sheridan managed , and for which he wrote the " School for Scandal . " The proscenium-arch was thirty-three feet wide , the back stage was forty-eight feet deep , the apron , or front stage , extended out seventeen feet , and the space for the audience extended seventy-two feet away from the curtain . The scenery was very much what we are still permitted to see in the pfesent performances of the earlier and simpler Italian operas . There was a drop-scene at the back , and there were on each side and parallel with the drop , five or six " wings , " representing trees or columns or side walls ; and through the broad openings between these wings the performers came out on the stage . The place of the action could be shifted any number of times by merely pushing out halfscenes which met in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set and sliding forward those of the second . This is the method of presentation which allowed Sheridan to put two or three different places into a single act of the " School for Scandal " and to display his characters first at Lady Sneeru'eli 's and then at Lady Teazle 's . It was the only method known to Shakspere 's earliest editors , from Rowe and Theobald down ; and they assumed naturally enough , in their ignorance of the More primitive Elizabethan theater , that this was the method employed by Shakspere ; and so they divided the text of his plays into acts and scenes , whenever they thought they could detect any indication of a change of place . This unwarranted and unfortunate division into acts and scenes is still to be found in most of our current editions , and conveys a wholly false impression of Shakspere 's real method . He conceived his play  | as a story told in action in a series of dialogues , most of which were held on the neutral ground that might be anywhere . It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact spot where the action lay that Shakspere ever thought of indicating it . We may be sure now that nothing was further from his thought than that his story should be cut up into snippets . He had written his plays in accordance with the conditions of the Elizabethan theater , the only one he knew anything about , and he could not foresee the conditions of the earlier Italianate theater which was to be introduced into England from France . Toward the end of the two centuries which extended from the Restoration to the middle of the nineteenth century , the conditions of performance began to change . The art of the scenepainter became more elaborate , and the levised , whereby a room could he shown with its walls and its ceiling . The influence of the realistic movement of the middle of the nineteenth century imposed on the stage-manager the duty of making every scene characteristic of the period and of the people , and of relating the characters closely to their environment . The facilities for lighting were greatly improved , first by the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally by the perfecting of the electric light . It was found to be possible to illuminate  | the stage so as to show the expression on the actors ' faces even in the remotest corners of the stage . The apron behind the curving footlights was no longer necessary or even useful , and the stage was therefore cut back to the prosceniumarch , which became a frame for the stage - opening . Sir Henry Herkomer has declared the modern practice when he asserted that " the proscenium should be to the stage-picture vthat the frame is to the easel picture : it should separate the stage-picture from the surroundings , just as a painted picture should reach the frame . " It is far this picture-frame stage that . ery dramatist of to-day is composing his : Vass. and his methods are of necessity use of the picture-frame stage , just as c methods of the Elizabethan dramatic , et mere of necessity those of the plat-orm-stage . Probably we have not yet  - -  en all the consequences of this striking change in the physical conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conform . Probably , also , we have not yet seized the full significance of the transformation . For example , as the actor is no longer partly surrounded by the audience , and as he is withdrawn beyond a magic line of separa tion , the drama is certain hereafter to be less oratorical , less rhetorical , less bombastic ; it is bound to be simpler in its language , more " natural . " The long soliloquy , the confidential self-revelation , which was not out of place on the platform-stage , when a character was on the neutralground that might be anywhere , and when he was so close to some of the spectators that he could put out his hand to touch them ? this is obviously inappropriate now when the actor is remote behind a picture-frame , and seated on a real chair in what looks like a real room . It has been asserted that the relinquishing of  | the soliloquy is to be ascribed to the influence of Ibsen , and it must be admitted that the Norwegian dramatist has been masterly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture-frame stage . But we can shift the real responsibility for the banishing of the soliloquy a little further back ; it does not lie on Ibsen 's shoulders , but on Edison 's , since it was an inevitable consequence of the incandescent bulb . Upon the picture-frame stage of the twentieth century it is now possible to present without any alteration or transposition the tragedies of Sophocles , composed in accordance with the conditions of the immense open-air theater of Athens , and also the comedies of Moliere , composed in accordance with the conditions of the tennis court playhouse of Paris . But the plays of Shakspere and of Sheridan can be put on this picture-frame stage of ours only after they have been rearranged and pulled about , because they were composed in accordance with the wholly different and absolutely incompatible conditions of the courtyard theater and of the post-Restoration playhouse . The picture-frame stage may be superior to its several predecessors or it may be inferior to them ; it is , at all events , different from them , and it is the stage to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing plays to-day , it is the picture-frame stage that they would work for , and we should find them so arranging the episodes of their stories that these could be presented with only a single set in each act , since the elaboration of our modern scenery makes it disadvantageous to attempt a change of scene while the curtain is up . This is a technical difficulty to be vanquished , which could not fail to affect their method of treatment and even to a certain extent their choice of theme . The technical possibilities of any art at any moment must more or less determine and may more or less limit not only how the artist shall express what he has to say , but also what he shall attempt to express . It is only after we have analyzed these technical possibilities that we are prepared to appreciate what the artist really has accomplished .  |
