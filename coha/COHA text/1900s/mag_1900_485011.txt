Lea Brothers &; Co , Philadelphia , will soon issue ' The Moriscos of Spain , their Conversion and Expulsion , ' by Henry Charles Lea , LL D. , in one volume royal 12mo of more than 400 pages . A new Life of Tennyson will form the second volume in the " Saintly Life Series " begun with Elizabeth Pease Nichol ; it is from the pen of Dr. R. F. Horton , and naturally studies its subject ethically and religiously . It well be published by Dutton . In January , R. H. Russell will bring out reproductions of drawings by Albert Doses , ' The Apocalypse , ' with text by Fitzroy Carrington . Truslove , Hanson &; Comba will shortly reprint ' The Club : or , A Grey Cap for a Green Head : Moral Maxims , Advice , and Cautions , in a Dialogue between a Father and a Son , By James Puckle , N.

Miller , with numerous illustrations Beginning with the new year , the publication house of Felix Dietrich of Leipzig will issue annual volumes of a ' Bibliographic der Deutschen Recensionen , ' as a supplement to the ' Bibliographic der Zeitschriften-Literatur . ' The editor is the well-known littdrateur L. Jellinek , and the purpose is to furnish a list of the book reviews that have , appeared during the year 1900 in about 1,000 scientific and technical journals of Germany . Houghton , Mifflin &; Co. , falling in with Paul E More The small volumes are well printed on good paper in open typography , have each a photogravure portrait as frontispiece , and display no research of the picturesque or unusual . What are virtually biographical essays hardly require an indeit , but an analytical table of contents would be useful Announced are biographies of William Penn , Gen. Grant , and Lewis and Clark . Mr. John Fiske 's ' Old Virginia and her Neighbors ' ( Houghton , Mifflin &; Co. ) has not had long to wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not superabundantly illustrated . The series to Which it belongs has set a good example of judgment in this sort of embellishment , and nothing trivial will be found among a great body of carefully selected portraits , views of historic houses , maps , facsimiles of MSS and of book-titles , etc. , etc. , which add materially to the intrinsic worth of Mr. Fiske 's flowing narrative . Of this we have already spoken critically on its first appearance The work is beautifully bound . Mr J. A. Symonds 's ' Shakespeare 's Predecessors in the English Drama ' has appeared in a cheaper edition ( London : Smith , Elder &; Co. , New York : Scribners ) . The book is too well known to need extended notice here . Though it is far from being an authoritative work , it contains so much that students wish to know , and is so attractively written , that it will long retain its place in all collections of Elizabethan apparatus . The new edition embodies no changes . - Under the title of ' Shakspere 's Life and Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly for the use of students , of his ' Life of William Shakspere ' ( Macmillan ) . The abridgment is made , as was to be expected , in a workmanlike manner , and , since it is sold for less than a dollar , will doubtless have a wide circulation . The footnotes to the larger edition are omitted , but much of the material they contain is now incorporated into the text . The discussion of the Sonnets is greatly reduced in bulk , but all the essential points in Mr Lee 's arguments are retained . There are a number of good and really Instructive illustrations , and the index Is elaborate and seems to be trustworthy . ' The Far East ? Its History and its Question ' ( London ? Grant Richards ; New York : Dutton ) , by Alexis Krausse , is a kind of re-infusion of the same author 's ' Russia in Asia ' and ' China in Decay , ' drawn off for sipping m the immediate crisis . The tone of the book is one of unblushing commercialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasteners to the prey ) , the nations are to go quickly to " take " what they want in China  --  all but Russia , that is . She is Krausse 's nightmare , and he would have all the rest of Europe awake to rescue China from the paw of the Bear . The especial value of his book lies in its appendix of 110 pages , where we have , besides a convenient chronology , copies of the more important treaties and conventions bearing on the Chinese situation . To be thus handily documented in all those larger matters of Chinese diplomacy , the student will be glad to give the volume shelf-room.charming ; and in the satirical " Little Chapter on Sport " ( wisdom for the child and nominally addressed to him , but calculated for the man ) there is a very effective combination of line and wash The title section fitly stands first , but there is much good fooling in the last " Curtain Calls , " and a pretty conceit , " Love and Time , " in the miscellaneous group styled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have been more severely compiled , will not detract from the author 's reputation It would be well for our classical instruction if the little book by Anton Malfertheiner , entitled ' Realerklarung and Anschauungs-Unterricht bei der Lecture der Griechisehen Classiker ' ( Vienna . Pithier ) could gain a wide circulation among our teachers In these days of low-priced reproductions , such as casts , electrotypes , prints , lantern slides , and photographs , there is no excuse for the classical instructor who does not make use of illustrative material , or " Realien , " in his teaching . In this little book , which is evidently the first of a series , Professor Malfertheiner gives us nearly one hundred pages of hints in. regard to the use of material illustrative of readings in Xenophon , Homer , and Herodotus , and directions for finding such material . He treats the subject partly under such heads as War , Mythology , or Topography , partly , as in his remarks on the Iliad and Odyssey , in the order of the verses To be sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinarily not accessible , but the most important , such as Helbig 's ' Das Homerische Epos , ' Baumeister 's ' Peak-males , ' and Schreiber 's Atlas , should be in the hands of every classical teacher . For the Latin teacher a work of this sort has been done by Josef ICubic ( Vienna ? Holder ) in his books on Cicero and Tacitus and on Horace . Two recent volumes of the Oxford Classics , Cmsar 's De Bello Galileo ' by R. Du Pontet , and the Vergil by F A Hirtzel , fully maintain the well-deserved reputation of this series Whatever we have said in these columns in commendation of previous volumes we can but repeat with respect to these . Type , paper , handiness of form , conscientious editing  --  in all these respects they are fully up to the standard of former issues and commend themselves to every lover of good books . The unrelenting laW of averages has rarely been more strikingly exemplified in the domain of social economy than by the recent statistics of the German Empire . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to argue a wonderful stability  --  we might almost say a dead calm  --  in economic conditions . The number of suicides in each of the years 1896 , 1897 , and 1898 was between 10,825 and 11,025 The number of emigrants in each of the years 1897 , 1898 , and 1899 exceeded 20,000 and fell below 25,000 . In face , however , of the harmony between the above sets of figures on the score of uniformity , there seems to be no connection between the dismal record of suicides and the tolerableness or intolerableness of existence in the Vaterland , as determined by economic conditions , for the proportion of suicides , to the population a few years back , when the flood of emigration was very high , was about the same as at present . Lovely Thuringia figures with the largest percentage of suicides in relation to the population , and uninteresting Posen , with the smallest .

The baptistery of Albenga was incontestably the most ancient Christian monument remaining entire in Liguria , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mod-era criticism , that is always finding the ancient buildings less old than they were generally believed to be , had assigned it to the end of the eighth century at the earliest . Important restorations now going on for once confirm the popular belief in a greater age  --  i e , of the fifth century , Removal of the existing pavement has disclosed the ancient pavement of precious marbles , with remains of the primitive baptismal font and the ciborium that covered it ; while simple cleaning about the altar niche has laid bare mosaics similar to those of the mausoleum of Galla Placidia at Ravenna , which dates from A. D. 440 The earth about the baptistery , which had gathered to the depth of eight or ten feet , has been removed , uncovering several tombs , Roman as well as Christian Remains of painting and sculpture , the pierced marbles filling the windows , a feature of great rarity , and the construction  --  now , for the first time in centuries , made evident  --  render the building of great interest to the archicologist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liguria , corresponding to the French Commission des Monuments His-tongues ) are being conducted with intelligence and conscience .

' He describes the , physical features and geology , while reports on the fauna and flora are contributed by several members of the Museum staff . , ' : Christmas Island " lies in the Indian Ocean , about 190 miles south of Java , and some 900 miles northwest of West Australia . Comprising about forty-three square miles , it rises in places to more than 1,000 feet above the level of the sea . It has been known to navigators since the middle of the seventeenth century , but until recently no attempt appears to have been made to penetrate beyond a few hundred yards from the ? hore , on account of the steep and rugged cliffs and the dense tropical vegetation ' Down to a few years ' ago it was probably the only existing tropical island of any large extent that had never been inhabited by man , savage or civilized . In 1887 , H.M.S. Egerta touched at the island , and some explorations were made toward the interior . It was formally annexed to the British crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company , which immediately made arrangements for its thordugh exploititfon . Very interesting results ' die anticipated from the careful study of the ' immediate effects produced by the immigration of civilized ' man , and the animals and plants which follow in his wake , upon the physical conditions , and upon the indigenous fauna and flora of an isolated oceanic island . Over 200 Europeans and Chinese have already become residents ; and of the various plants introduced for food , several species have run wild and are ' entering into competition with the native flora . Formosa , or Taiwan , as the Japanese call their new possession , adopting the Chinese name , is described in Petermann 's teepee , No. 10 , by Dr. N. Yamasaki , a member of the exploring expedition sent out by the University of Tokyo in 1896 . He devotes himself mainly to an account of its physical features , its geology , the formation of the coast-line , the courses of the rivers , the volcanoes , and the climate .

Gold was discovered in 1890 by a Chinaman who had been in California and was employed in building a railroad bridge across the Kilung River It exists both in the river-bed and in quartz formation . Coal is abundant , but of poor quality . There are also sulphur-mines and petroleum-beds . The fauna includes thirty-one species of mammals , the largest of which is a bear , and 150 species of birds An excellent map accompanies the article . It is good news from Korea that a Korean branch of the Royal Asiatic Society has just been organized in Seoul , the capital Three honorary members were elected , Mr. William G. Aston , the well-known scholar in Japanese and Korean , the Rev John Ross , D.D. , of Mukden , author of works on Korea and the Mantchus , and W. E. Griffis , L.H.D. , author of ' Korea , the Hermit Nation . ' At the first public meeting , held Wednesday , October 24 , the Rev. James A. cGale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammar and dictionary , read a paper on " The Influence that they can ask for , and it is an additional satisfaction that the action to this effect was by a unanimous vote on the part of the Trustees . Princeton and the Johns Hopkins are now the only colleges in the whole country offering post-graduate courses at all that do not offer them to women . There is the less excuse for this at Johna Hopkind on account of the fact that the simplicity of the organization at that university is such that no modifications whatever would be entailed by the change in question , and also that the presence of women in the medical school renders the attitude of the University illogical to the last degree . It remains to be seen how long these two institutions will have the courage to maintain themselves in their lonely isolation ? The color " processes " of the magazines have become so stupendous that we do not attempt criticism . For a bewildering specimen we may refer the reader to the Christmas Century 's edition of Milton 's " Ode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of papers called " Down the Rhine , " with drawings by Andre Castaigne , and Sir Walter Besant has an illustrated article on " East London Types " An illustrated paper , with the rather flat title , " What More than Wages , " by William Howe Tolman , gives a good deal of information as to the efforts now being made by employers to improve the moral , intellectual , and social tone of the factory workman . This movement , - which seems in some degree to have taken the place of the " profit-sharing " movements of half a century since , is founded upon a different idea . As one employer is made to say by Mr. Tolman , the difficulty about profit-sharing is that there are often no profits to share . If employees share in profits , justice would seem to require that they should also share in losses  --  which is exactly what to the ordinary wage-earner would be most distasteful and even seem unjust . The expenditure of capital to give workmen good homes at low rents , pleasant playgrounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded on the idea that such an investment actually pays the employer in the improved energy and self-respect of the workman . An English case , for instance , is given of a cold-blooded employer who has spent $1,250,000 on cottages , schools , club buildings , small parks , gardens , and recreation grounds in his industrial village near Liverpool . There is no direct return on the capital . He declares that he is no altruist , but has done it for the good of his business and found it profitable . The opposite principle was that on which slaves were worked in the West Indies  --  work them the maximum number of hours , and work them to death . If , as appears , the world is really waking up to the truth that labor can be brought to the highest pitch of efficiency only through the encouragement of the ambition and self-respect of the laborer , the coming century will be marked by one of the greatest steps ever made in the solution of the " labor problem . " Of course , the movement must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of corns of the new Socialists to tax the public to provide for the " humbler classes .

Scribner 's for December contain-Et a critical review of George Eliot by W. C. Brownell which will repay , not only reading , but study . It Is full of shrewd " appreciation , " which becojnies at times what many admirers will think depreciation , owing , it seems to us , to his devoting most attention to what are really George Eliot 's less important novels . Even in view of the success of ' Middlemarch , ' we should be inclined to think that her important books  --  the books by which she must in the long run be judged ? are those which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill on the Floss . ' She was no exception to the rule that great novelists usually write themselves out , attaining their highest level in their earliest efforts and afterwards falling into repetition and elaboration . From the perspective in which Mr. Brownell considers her books , it might be inferred that he regarded her worst work as most deserving of attention . However this may be , his analysis is searching , and often convincing . He puts George Eliot at the head of psychological novelists , and at the same time imputes to her " a limited imaginative faculty , defective sense of art , and an inordinate ' aggrandizement of the purely intellectual element in human character . " But he distinguishes her sharply from the so-called " intellectual woman , " of whom he says : " In books or in fact the first impression made by the so-called intellectual woman is that of the inadequacy of the intellect . There is so much else that is worth while , one reflects in the presence of such thorough-going exclusions . . . . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one finds that she might be even more so , even if less strictly so , with advantage . " " And perhaps there is nothing that sets George Eliot off from the mass of her sex for whom the intellect is a universal talisman , so much as the circumstance that she does not make this impression . On the contrary , one 's Impression is of the plenary power and sufficiency of the intellect unaided and tusillumined ab extra " This brings us to the question , What is there to illumine the intellect ab extra ? Mr. BTOWnell 's answer is religion . George Eliot had no religion ; was a Comtist and an agnostic , consequently she was bonzes . Or rather , perhaps , being a Christian by inheritance , she threw off that religion and fell back on philosophy and duty , which will not supply its place . That she had no religion we can not concede , for the novel became in her hands an instrument of agnostic faith , for which she would , no doubt , have gone to the stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farge has an interesting article on Puvis de Chavannes , accompanied by plates in color which are called " reproductions " Mr. Thomas Bailey Aldrich contributes a new kind of tale , " An Untold Story " The writers of " short stories " should examine it with care . It is only two pages and a half long , and might be made much shorter , and the point is that the story is left out . ? A Maurice Low has , In the Atlantic , a sort of rhapsody on the national capital , called " Washington The City of Leisure . " It is not altogether perfecteelndeed it iso hero and there , decidedly weak , but - several things are well put , as , for instance , the writer 's demolition of the tradition that there is an old " residential society " in Washington , composed of natives , Southern and aristocratic  --  a sort of Faubourg- set , left over from the past , and living apart from the present , a society which looks down on the mushroom nouveaux riches of today as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sprung up since the Bourbons went out . This is , as Mr. Low says , a pure superstition No such society is to lie found in Washington , the important people having long been of a totally different sort . A name here and there is pretty much all that is left of the Southern society which dominated the capital down to the time when Buchanan left the White House Mr. Low is evidently an Imperialist , for be thinks that Alexander Shepherd unconsciously rendered a great service to Washington by giving " his people " an object-lesson in " the benefits to follow ' from pure autocracy " By this he apparently means that government by commission , such as followed the downfall of the Shepherd ring , is the true form of municipal government . If so , all New York needs to make it happy is to have it governed by an army officer and two civilians appointed by the Governor of the State " War as a Moral Medicine , " by Goldwin Smith , is a very effective reply to Dean Farrar 's late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most people are ready to admit that past wars , such as the Crimean , the Afghan , or the " Lorcha , " wars , were rather demoralizing and useless . The very war which to-day is holy and glorious because we are engaged in it , becomes in retrospect useless or wrong . Mr. Smith 's article contains a rather ugly story about Lord Palmerston. whose moral character was unimproved by war ? Harper 's has an article on " Victor Hugo as an Artist , " by Benjamin-Constant These illustrations are selected from a " vast collection " of his paintings and drawings placed at the orders of the magazine , and more will appear in a later issue , " with comment by M. Paul Meurice , the chief custodian of Victor Hugo memorabilia . " Mr Benjamin-Constant discusses Hugo 's sketches in the light of his literary works , and thinks that he " comes near to being a master among masters . " Salvator Rosa , Callot , Goya , or Delacroix " might have signed more than one of these . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " His invention , brilliant and prolific as it is , has not the compass , the power , the audacity of Hugo 's ? for the mark of the beast is everywhere met with upon his ink-stained papers , sometimes raging , sometimes laughing , but always evidencing a violent romanticism , where the pencil is as revolutionary as the idea . " Henri Fouquier contributes an illustrated paper on Bernhardt and Coquelin . Every one knows that Bernhardt is not only an actress , but a sculptor and manager as well ; she is , it seems , also a sportsman , and has " brought down " her deer and her crocodile , to say nothing of her having some live pumas , brought from South America , in her courtyard Coquelin 's life is as humdrum as hers is eccentric , it is that , in fact , of " a hard-working bourgeois . " He is entirely a self-made man , being the son of a baker , and towing nothing in his great success to any one but himself . Dr. Carl Peters gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in an article illustrated by photographs and a map , and drawings by E. W. Deming . Solomon , it will be remembered , was in the habit of getting gold from Ophir ; he was apparently a monometallist , for we are told that silver " was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon , " though silver , ivory , apes , and peacocks also came from Ophir . The place was clearly in Africa , for Ophir is Afer , and Afer is the root of Africa . Further identification was made comparatively easy by an old French map and a description of the Portuguese gold mines of Furor , which again is " nothing but a native corruption of the old Semitic word Afer , or Ophir " Now this Fura gold region is on the Zambesi , a region from which the Ophir products mentioned in the Bible could readily have been exported The paper concludes with the significant statement that the writer has " made friends " with the local chieftain , and that " large properties in his country belong to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Tuskegee : Its Story and its Work ' ( Boston . Small , Maynard &; Co ) is the outcome of much careful preparation Mr. Thrasher has made many visits to Tuskegee , attended critically on Mr. Washington 's speaking North and South , visited the scenes of his early life , and , best of all , has followed up many of his students after their graduationinto their neW activities The praise of Mr. Washington is extremely warm , but not warmer than is Just . It is certain , however , that not many white men could safely bear so much The story of his early life is not so full as is his autobiography now running in the Outlook , but Benjamin Franklin 's arrival in Philadelphia was not more interesting than his in Richmond , without a cent in his pocket , and afterward at the Hampton School , where be was not regarded as a promising addition .

There should have been some correction of the mistake , industriously multiplied in some quarters , that Mr Washington is willing to make the political rights of his people subordinate to their material prosperity . Of all the illustrations , which are many and instructive , the most significant is that of the two boys who walked five hundred miles to get to Tuskegee
