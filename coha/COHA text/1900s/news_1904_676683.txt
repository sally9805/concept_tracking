O'Brien dashed into the hallway of 1.999 Third Avenue , closely followed by Fireman Webber of Hook and Ladder Company 14 . Isaac Bittker , a dry goods merchant , of 1.959 Third Avenue was standing in the doorway . He was not impressed with O'Brien 's appearance and tried to stop YAM from entering .

He handed the baby to Fireman Webber , who reached out to receive it from a window in the Doyle flat .
