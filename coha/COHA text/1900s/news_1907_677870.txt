txt State 's Attorney John J. Healy predicted last evening that the brewers and saloonkeepers of Chicago will bring about their own ruin by fighting the Sunday closing movement that is sweeping over the city . Ho said that the state law on the question was absolutely plain and that he would enforce It with all his power . The saloonkeepers by their actions , he asserted , have aroused a revolt among the thinking people of the city that will result eventually not only in Sunday observance , but in ahorter hours for the saloons and the wiping out of existence of many disorderly places leagued with vioe and crime . Mr. Healy made these statements before the Men 's club of St. Peter 's Episcopal church , ' Evanston and Belmont avenues . His subject was the crime conditions of the city , but he soon branched from this to the live topic of the hour . No Longer a Religious Movement . " There is a revolt sweeping over the city today which may or may not result in the closing of saloons on Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state is clear beyond a question . Some saloons do comparatively little harm . But in the red light districts , where the saloons are adjuncts to disorderly houses , more harm is done than all our courts can overcome . I am not discussing this from a religious point of view , for the Sunday closing movement is no longer a religious movement . If it were , we never would close them . It is a moral and practical movement , a question of the proper conduct of city affairs . " I told the brewers of the city more than a year ago : " ' You are breeding a condition of affairs in Chicago that eventually will wipe you out of business . You have gone to extremes . You are going to create a condition of re-'volt that will close many of your saloons now doing business . ' " And that is the situation they have brought on today . Saloon RevoCations Evaded . " We thought that the 81,000 license would help settle the question of the disreputable saloon . We have prosecuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. But the best . we can ' get is a $200 One . The revocation of " Ifeonith. means that ? the bartender:or the cousin of the proprietor gets outa new one . " When a man goes into a saloon at 8 p. m. and stays until 8 a. m. guzzling beer he is in a fit condition to commit crime . " They say the saloon is the poor man 's club and therefore we should not deprive him of this solace on Sunday . That is a most fallacious argument . The man who works all day usually has a family , and the best place for him is at home getting acquainted with his family and saving his money . " This is a practical proposition , not a wild eyed reform . If the brewers and saloonkeepers of Chicago were wise they Would meet this demand , prevailing not only in the churches but among the majority of clean thinking men . They would meet it not only by closing on Sunday but at n o'clock every night and not opening before 7 o'clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are enforcing the Sunday closing law in my office because it is the law . If you do n't want the saloons closed Sunday , repeal the law . When a. man asks me to stand up and swear to enforce all the laws and then turns around and asks me to leave one of the laws alone , I say to that man , No . I do n't care if it spelled my political ruin ten thousand times over . It Is enforced throughout Illinois and can be here in Chicago . " A man ' can drink temperately and be unharmed , but when you know that in the red light districts every saloon panders to the lowest forms of vice and crime then you can understand . I have heard ministers preach the ' necessity of the social evil . A more damnable doctrine never was preached . " Men that visit these places are degenerates . Until you wipe out the disorderly house and the low saloon you will have the conditions now  --  conditions that fill our criminal courts with cases that it will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . " It is a sin and a crime to keep alive these conditions , because we are making criminals out of .. our boys and girls , who mould otherwise make good citizens . Yet It is tolerated and recognized . It is the sin of all the Yo-Milani parties . Would Drive Out About 300,000 . " In all sincerity I say that we do not need a greater Chicago , but a better Chicago . In : . stead of building up the population to the 8,000,000 mark I would drive out of the city 800,000 or 400,000 undesirable , disreputable citizens . It would be bettor for our moral and commercial life . " In my office we have 15,000 or 20,000 crim ; final , cases a year . London , a city of - three times out size , has comparatively few crimes . " Nearly all our criminals come from the three vice ridden districts of the city . The large majority of their : offenders are boys of from 17 to 25 years old . They have been brought up in the criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These things will prevail until you have wiped out the levee which reaches out for all . our boys and girls . When you put the lid down hard on the liquor traffic or wipe it out altogether then you can close half of your courts . "
