 |p1233  MATWOCK , the huge polar bear , drifted down from the Arctic on an iceberg and landed , one spring night , in the fog , at Little Harbor Home on the east Newfoundland coast . It seemed at first a colossal fatality , that iceberg . The fishermen had just brought their families back from the winter lodge in the woods , and had made their boats ready to go out to the Hookand-line grounds for a few fresh cod to keep themselves alive . Then a heavy fog shut in , and in the midst of the fog the iceberg came blundering into the tickle , as if there were no other place in a thousand leagues of sea and rock.bound coast . There were two hundred fathoms of water at the harbor mouth and the great berg touched bottom softly , yet with a terrific impact which sent huge masses of ice crashing down on the black rocks on either side . It might stay a month , or it might drift away on the next tide . Meanwhile the fishermen were helpless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor mouth , and not even a punt could get out or in . Old Tomah , the Indian , came that same day from his hunting camp far away in the interior . Grown tired of beaver meat and willow bark , he had brought some otter skins to trade for a little pork and tobacco , with a few warm stockings thrown in for good measure . But the trading schooner , for which the islanders watch in spring as a lost man watches  |p1234  for morning , had not yet come , and the fishermen were themselves at the point of starvation . For a month they had tasted nothing but a little dried fish and doughballs . Hunting was out of the question , for their dogs were all dead and their few guns were out with the young men , who , before the advent of the iceberg , had taken their lives in their hands and gone up the coast sealing in a stout little schooner . So Tomah , taking his otter skins , started back for his own camp . As his custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest hill in the neighborhood to get his bearings . The blundering iceberg seemed to him a grim joke , more grim than the joke on himself which had left him after a fortymile tramp without pork or tobacco or warm stockings . He was watching the berg with silent , Indian intentness when a mass of overhanging ice crashed down on the rocks . Something stirred in a deep cave suddenly laid open ; the next instant his keen eyes made out the figure of a huge white bear standing in the cave , rocking his head up and down as the smell of the village drifted out of the harbor into his hungry nostrils . Tomah came down from the hill to leave a warning at the little store . " Bes ' look out , " he said . " Bear over dere on dat hice ; big , oh , big one ! He come here to-night , soon 's dark , see w'at he kin find . He hungry , an ' oh , cross ! do n't ' fraid noting . Bes ' set um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he had left his own gun behind and could borrow none in the village , he started inland on his long tramp . Matwock the bear landed from his iceberg as soon as it was dark , as Tomah had said , and headed straight for the village . For a month he had been adrift in the open sea without food , because the seals , which had first enticed him away till fifty miles of open water stretched between him and his native haunts , had now returned to the coast to rear their young on the rocks and grounded ice floes . Meanwhile the great berg , to which he clung as a mariner to a floating spar , drifted steadily southward over the mist-shrouded ocean , with its foot a thousand feet deep in a powerful current . Most of the time he had slept , going back to the old bear habit of hibernation to save his strength ; but when the berg grounded and the wind from the harbor brought the smell of fish and of living animals to his nose he sprang up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fear . Straight and swift he followed his nose , ready to seize the first food , living or dead , that lay in his path . On the outskirts of the village he came upon a huge deadfall which the men had made hurriedly at Tomah 's suggestion , partly to get meat , of which they were in sore need , but more to protect themselves and their little ones from the savage prowler which knew no fear . The bait was a lot of offal , bones and fish skins tied together with cod line , and the fall-log was the stump of a big mast , waterlogged and heavy as lead , which had come ashore years ago from a wreck and which they made heavier still by rocks lashed on with cables . Matwock entered the pen swiftly , grabbed the bait , and , thud ! clown came the weighted log on his shoulders . Now a black bear would have been caught across the small of the back and his spine cracked like an eggshell by the fearful blow . But Matwock was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a roar of rage he hurled the log aside , smashed the pen into fragments , and charged straight through the village , knocking to pieces with blows of his terrible paws the pens and fishflakes that stood across his path . Matwock went back to his cave in the iceberg , angry and sore , yet with a strange timidity at heart from this first experience in the abodes of men . What the beastly thing was that had fallen on his back he had , of course , no idea , but he had learned in a minute that he could not prowl here with the power and authority that marked him in the vast snowy solitudes where no man dwells . He was licking a wound that a chain had torn in his shaggy white coat when a faint scratching and grunting , amid the ceaseless roar of breakers and booming of waves in the ice caverns , came to his sensitive ears and made him steal out instantly to investigate . Down on a shelf of ice , on the seaward side of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy with food , to sleep and bask a while in the sun ,  |p1235  which was just then rising . A glance told the bear that the big seals had chosen the spot well , where no danger could approach save from the open sea out of which they had just come . Of the berg itself they had no fear whatever , for it rose behind them a hundred feet in a sharp incline to where a score of glistening spires and minarets began , on which the sea birds were nesting . So they stretched their fat bulks comfortably on the narrow shelf of ice , watching the open sea , blinking sleepily in the sunshine . Slowly , cautiously Matwock circled the berg , creeping upward along a great crevice to reach another shelf over the basking seals . His great feet were padded thickly with fur , which clung to the ice like wool , and where the ascent was most ticklish the muscles of his forelegs contracted strongly , driving his claws like steel hooks into the ice . So he gained the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eyes showing over the edge as he looked down hungrily at his game . Below him was a dizzy incline , steep as a mountain top , polished and glistening with the frost and storms of the centuries , at the foot of which the unconscious seals were basking . Very deliberately Matwock chose his position over the larger seal ; then with his hind legs he pushed himself steadily over the edge , crouching low on his belly , with his nose on his forepaws , which were stretched straight out in front of him . Like a flash of light he glanced down over the slope , striking the seal a terrific blow and knocking him end over end as the bear shot over him into the sea . There was a terrible commotion for an instant , which set the sea birds flapping and clamoring wildly ; then out of the turmoil Matwock 's head arose , gripping the big seal by the neck . He laid his dame carefully on the ice shelf , kicked himself up after it and ate it there , where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . The presence of his favorite game in the strange land turned Matwock 's thoughts from the village of men into which he had blundered with the iceberg . No boats came out or in to disturb him , so he kept his abode in the ice cavern , which was safe and warm , and out of which he wandered daily up and down the rocky coast . A few mother seals had their young here hidden on the great ice floes , which were fast anchored to the rocks and shoals . The little seals are snow white at first ? for kind Nature forgets none of her helpless children ? the better to hide on the white ice on which they are born . Only their eyes and the tips of their noses are black , and at the first alarm they close their eyes and lie very still , so that it is almost impossible to see them . Even when you stand over them they look like rough lumps of snow-ice . If they have time they even hide the black tips of their noses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly they simply close their eyes , and the black nose tip looks like a stray pebble or a tiny bit of bark left by the uneasy winds that sweep over the ice floes . As they grow larger and begin to fish for themselves they gradually turn dark and sleek , like their mothers , the better to slip unseen through the dark waters in which they hunt . Like all bears Matwock has poor eyes and depends chiefly on his nose in scouting . He would swim swiftly , mile after mile , along the edges of the floes , raising his head to sniff every breeze , trying to locate where the young seals were hiding . But the little ones give out almost no scent at such times , besides being invisible , and Matwock rarely dined on a nest of young seals . The only way he could catch them was by a cunning bit of bear strategy . He would swim far out from the edge of the floes and drift about among the floating ice , looking himself like an ice cake ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hours till he saw a big seal clamber out and knew from her actions that she was feeding her young . Then he would head straight and swift for the spot and nose all over it till he found what he was seeking . When the big bull seals came ashore to bask in the sun . resting on a rock or the edge of an ice floe , whence they could slip instantly into deep water , Matwock adopted slyly a different style of hunting . He would slip silently far down to leeward ? for the seal 's nose is almost as keen as his own ? and there begin his cautious stalk up-wind . Sinking his  |p1236  enormous weight deep in the water till only his nose and the top of his head appeared , he would glide slowly along the edge of the floe , looking exactly like a bit of loose ice drifting along in the tide . When near the game he would disappear entirely , and , like an otter , not a ripple marked the spot where he went down . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice floe , raising himself on his flippers to stretch like a wolf , or turning uneasily to warm both sides at the sun , when the huge head and shoulders of a bear would shoot up out of the water directly in front of him . One swift , crushing blow of the terrible paw and the seal would be dead without a thought of what had happened to him . So Matwock lived and hunted for a week , growing fat and contented again . Then the seals vanished on one of their sudden migrations ? following the fish , no doubt ? and for a week more he hunted without a mouthful . One night , when he returned late to his cave , the great iceberg had broken its anchorage and drifted well out of the tickle , and from the harbor the smell of fresh fish drifted into his hungry nostrils . For the day had been sunny and calm , and the starving fishermen had slipped out to the Hook-and-line grounds and brought back exultingly the first cod of the season . Again Matwock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's swim , and headed straight for the good smell in the village . The big deadfall was set in his path , baited with fresh offal , and the log was weighted twice as heavily as before . But the bear had learned cunning and entered the trap from the rear , tearing the heavy pen to pieces as if it were made of straws . The fall came down again with a thud that made the ground shiver , but it fell harmlessly on the bedlog , and Matwock ate the bait greedily to the last scrap . Then he entered the village , rummaging the wharves and sheds boldly , and leaving his great footprints at every door . Late that night Old Tomah appeared with his otter skins and a haunch of caribou at Daddy Crummet 's cabin , on the edge of the woods far down at the bottom of Long Arm . All winter Daddy Crummet had been sick ? chiefly from lack of food and rheumatism ? and Tomah , taking pity on the lonely old man . blundered around in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savory meat which he had brought with him all the way from his camp in the interior . At twilight a fisherman had come to leave a couple of fresh cod and hurry away again on his long , weary pull up the Arm . Daddy meant to cook the fish , but was too weak when the time came . and left them in a barrel in his little shed . Then came Tomah with his stew , and the old man ate and felt better . It was midnight when they had smoked a pipe of Tomah 's dried willow bark and traded the scant news from the two ends of the wilderness and turned in to sleep . A terrible racket in the shed roused them ? whack ! bang ! thump ! Something was out there knocking everything to pieces . Daddy , under the bed-clothes , began to shiver and wail that the devil himself had come to fetch him . Tomah jumped up like a Jack-in-a-box , just as a barrel was flung against the door with a crash that made it shiver . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some huge beast crunching the codfish between his jaws . Tomah had brought his gun this time . He grabbed it from behind the stove . pulled the big hammer back , and felt with his fingers to be sure that the cap was ready on the nipple . He stole to the door and opened it a crack , pushing the gun barrel out ahead of him . A huge white beast turned swiftly as the door squeaked . Tomah , making out what seemed to him a great head in the darkness , poked the muzzle of the gun into it and pulled the trigger . There was a deafening roar ; the door was slammed back in the face of the old Indian with a force that sent him sprawling on his back . When Tomah scrambled to his feet , his ears ringing , his nose filled with pungent powder smoke , there lay Matwock at the end of his long trail . He was lying as if asleep , his great paws outspread across the threshold , his head resting heavily between them . The tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips were parted in a ferocious grin , as if to the end it were all a huge joke .
