txt Whatever may be the inside influences that have brought around the changes in the Ministry of the Emperor of Japan , it is probable that these will lead to a somewhat more conservative and economical policy , especially with regard to Governmental expenditures in industrial enterprises . It was announced in the middle of December that a considerable retrench-1 ment had been decided on in military and naval expenses , in order to secure funds for industrial development . Re . trenchment in the latter direction also now seems to be demanded . On the face of the official statements , the financial condition of Japan does not seem unpromising . The budget for the year 1907-8 showed an equality of receipts and expenditures. abolit $250 , - 000,000 each , with $75,000,000 for interest and for reduction of debt . But this amount of revenue , regarded as the product of a population mostly agricultural , rather densely gathered  --  the population is 48,000,000 , with an average of 317 to the square mile , about twice that of the State of New York  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is estimated at about the present amount of the debt , ** and of this debt rather more than one-half is held abroad . In face of these facts conservative action if not now enforced is bound soon to become imperative . It must be remembered that , apart from the burden caused by the war , and by the maintenance of the military and naval establishment imposed by the position and the ambitions of the Empire , Japan has on its hands the development of Korea , the promotion of its interests in Manchuria , and the management of Formosa , each of them a relatively novel and exacting task . The problem for her statesmen is the balance between projects that promise to be productive in the long run and the ability of her people to supply the needed capital for these , and the funds required for current expenditure . Thiel delicate and difficult work will not be rendered easier by the natural movements of opinion and sentiment among a population relatively unused to the exercise of political power , and more or less excited by the experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Japan in theory is still under the absolute authority of the Emperor , the Constitution of 1889. with the changes of 1800 , has resulted In a considerable influence of popular opinion on the course of the Government , The Ministers are still responsible to the Emperor alone , and are appointed or removed by him , but the Diet has a substantive share in the lawmaking power , and especially in the control of the revenues and disbursements , and that entails a practical accountability to the electorate . In reality , the Government of Japan is more liberal in the democratic sense than that of Prus ? sia , for instance . It is in view of these facts that our own Government has shown a ' disposition to deal with consideration and care with questions arising between our country and Japan . It Is obviously to the lasting interest of our people that the utmost possible friendliness shall prevail in our relations with the Government and the people of Japan . It is possible for the two Powers to aid or to hinder each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual helpfulness and much to be lost by friction , should that be allowed to grow up . From this point of view It is to be hoped that the changes now taking place in the Japanese Ministry will tend toward a conservative policy , and toward the secure and steady progress of Japan in the paths of peaceful prosperity .
