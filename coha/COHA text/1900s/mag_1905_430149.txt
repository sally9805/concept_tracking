HEN I returned to St. Petersburg after nearly a year 's abBence , though there were no bulletins to announce Russian or even Japanese victories , and no flags or illuminations to proclaim the birthday of the Emperor or some other imperial fete , every other man was humming , " There ' s a holiday in our street . " " Ca n't you feel the difference ? " asked a man who had spent two of the last twelve months in prison . I pleaded my too recent arrival . " Well , I ( 1o . I feel it asleep and awake . I know that the police will not come tonight and arrest me or search my house . I do not know how long it will last , but I am enjoying the new sense of security . " I had come at a favorable moment . On the day before one hundred and four men , representing the provincial zemstvos , institutions of self-government operating in thirty-four of the provinces of European Russia , had met to formulate a program for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time in a different private house , partly to prevent possible outbursts of popular rejoicing , partly perhaps to forestall other interruptions , were continued four days , and , though businesslike to an exemplary degree , were characterized by feelings of optimism and enthusiasm rarely observed in this land of chronic pessimism . After wandering forty years in the wilderness , the constitutionalists believe that they have at last sighted the promised land . Scarcely had the Emperor Alexander II established the district and provincial zemstvos when voices were raised demanding the completion of the truncated pyramid by the summons of delegates from the provinces to St. Petersburg to participate in legislation , and the broadening of its foundations by the creation of a smaller zemstvo unit corresponding to the American township or the English parish . Mr. Witte has furnished classic testimony to the sincerity and logical necessity of these expectations . How they have been blighted up to the present is sufficiently well known . However , the darkest hour is just before the dawn , and the bitterest cold often heralds the approach of spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Plehve . Two of his assistants were engaged in a hectoring inspection of the zemstvos ? in other words , were preparing for their further mutilation or their complete suppression ? when a well-known event put a period to their activity . The indescribable crescendo of popular hopefulness characteristic of the last few weeks in Russia must be credited in large part to Mr. Plehve 's successor , Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky , as is only natural in a country where so much depends on persons , so little on law . Prince Mirsky told a friend the circumstances of his appointment . He was at his post as governor-general of Vilna , several weeks after Plehve 's death , whex a telegram summoned him to an audience of the Emperor . His Majesty talked to him a long time about all possible  |p787  subjects except the vacant portfolio . He returned to Vilna and exchanged congratulations with his wife . Again several weeks passed , and he was commanded to a second audience . Again the Emperor chatted with him on various topics , but said not a word about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Prince , " his Majesty then said , " I can scarcely get what I have to say to you over my tongue . I hardly dare ask it because I know it is against your own wishes , but you would do me a great favor if you would be minister of the interior . " " Your Majesty 's intuition is correct , " answered Prince Mirsky ; " I do not seek this honor , but I am a soldier in your Majesty 's service . It is for you to cornmand , for me to obey . " He began to ask what policy he would be expected to pursue , but the Emperor interrupted him . " Please go at once to my mother and tell her you have accepted . She is so impatient to know your decision . " Prince Mirsky was not a wholly unknown figure . A great landed magnate , a relative of Count Sheremetiev and of the latter 's protege , Sipiaghin , he had held the position of chief of the politica police under Plehve . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission that deported many restless spirits , in cluding about three hundred literary men of Si . Petersburg and several hundred students . Nevertheless , he was not a man after Plehve 's heart , and he accepted a transfer to Vilna , where he won the sym pathies of all classes of the population ? Russians , Jews , Lithuanians , and Poles Since his appointment as minister he ha told friends that he had long felt himsel in a false position and was about to resign when Sipiaghin 's murder made it impossible do so . It was recalled that he had a to ways been suave and genteel even in hi intercourse with political suspects ; and then , press-blind Russia has a wonderfully fine sixth sense . It was in the air tha Mirsky would introduce a new era . The minister did not announce a program . Al that he did ? but that sufficed to electrify the country ? was to allow himself to be in favor of freedom of the quoted greater press , of relaxing the rigors of the prevail ing police system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confi slence between the government and the semstvos . These few and vague utterances loosed the tongue of Russia . The press lost no time , and with growing candor and daring exposed the existing evils and discussed the reforms that were coming . Some old scores were squared with remarkable promptitude . Father Petrov , a priest of unusual cultivation , made a furious onslaught , over his own signature , upon K. P. Pobiedonostsev , the procurator of the Holy Synod , under the transparent disguise of a " modern Spanish grand inquisitor . " Father Petrov had been one of the most popular lecturers of the Russian counterpart- of the Young Men 's Christian . Association , established and partly maintained by an American . His talks rather tended to overlook the church and to make a direct appeal to the individual conscience . Some time ago he was ordered to submit his addresses in future to the censorship of his spiritual superiors . He took this as a hint to stop talking altogether . So at this new opportunity he got back at the " grand inquisitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old gaunt , dry as parchment , with no marrow in his bones and little blood in his heart , is one of the most assiduous workers . His study is piled with books , newspapers , and reviews in various languages . He has published a series of works on jurisprudence , theology , social science , and other subjects . He is erudite and is gifted with powers of rapid and deep analysis . However , all that he does or says is permeated with the air of the tomb . Thanks to his rare understanding , his exceptional education , and his invariable , emphatic loyalty to the church , he has enjoyed a strong support and exercised a powerful , but fatally pernicious , influence upon church and state . He has allowed nothing and nobody to advance , has held the people and the clergy in ignorance , sown discord in the country , and provoked general irritation . Educated people have largely risen against the church , lost faith , become godless and inimical to everything that even reminds them of religion , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been people of God knows what sort of character and disposition . Everything that was honorable in the country has fallen away from him , and he has been forced to accept as assistants anybody that he could find . Among them there is not a single intelligent man with his heart in his work . Nearly all are thieves and bribe-takers , at best coarse , self-seeking politicians . They  |p788  hate their employment and despise one another and themselves . They flatter their chief shamelessly , and , though he sees through their sycophancy , he is seduced and poisoned by it ? indeed , can not live without it , can not bear the slightest disagreement , and screams , waves his arms , and stamps his feet at even the most venerable spiritual dignitaries . He has terrible eyes ; God forbid that any man should have such eyes , wicked , evil , contemning everything and everybody , and full of the deepest mental torment . He is the greatest nihilist that could possibly exist , for he not only repudiates institutions , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not personally deny the existence of God . In any case , he is the greatest of sinners . In the name of God he slays God 's image in man , and under the banncr of the love of Christ is up to the elbows in blood . He and all he does is one great mortal sin ? sin against the Holy Ghost , for he does not recognize , and therefore strangles , the human soul . He is , in the literal sense of the word , the real destroyer of souls . Copies of the newspaper that printed this , and of those which had the courage to reproduce it , sold for enormous prices . The same honor was paid the articles of Prince Eugene Troubetskoi , professor in the University of Kieff , in which the government officials were called to an accounting for all the unpreparedness and surprises of the war . The Japanese had found , and continue to find , Russia asleep . This is not the fault of the people , for the officials have been diligently engaged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If any uneasy sleeper stirred , he was rudely bidden to shut up and lie still . When the zemstvos ventured to speak , they were emphatically told that the general affairs of the country were not their concern . The officials who claimed to be the only authorized guardians of the countrykept their eyes open onlyfor domestic enemies . Those who were being defeated in the East were not the gallant soldiers and sailors , but the government officials . The zemstvos greeted the new era by sending Prince Mirsky messages of congratulation and thanks , and hastened preparations for an inter-zemstvo conference . Mr. Plehve had offered the hope that the provincial zemstvo presidents would be allowed to meet to discuss certain local questions . After his death the plan was widened . Not only the presidents but unofficial delegates from the various provinces were to be invited . Prince Mirsky gave his consent , and offered to place his offices at the disposal of the conference . Whether he was ill informed of the plans of the zemstvoists or met with opposition in conservative quarters need not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked if they intended to broach the question of a constitution . They said they did . He answered that he would have to report this to the Emperor , and afterward informed them that his Majesty refused to consent to the conference being held . The zemstvoists declared their intention of meeting as private persons . Thereupon Prince Mirsky said that , having communicated the will of the Emperor , he desired to drop the role of minister for a moment and to speak as a friend . Would they not be satisfied to meet in Nijni-Novgorod or to wait until a more convenient season ? They refused to accept either suggestion ; nevertheless he gave them to understand that he would not disperse the meeting by force . Many of the members of the conference were previously unacquainted with one another , and they represented the most conservative as well as the most radical tendencies among the zemstvos . All seemed , however , to strive to throw aside personal whims and private views and to arrive at an understanding . A substantial unanimity was actually reached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all except one member . This gives them far greater importance than they would otherwise have , as they would appear to represent the average opinion of the overwhelming majority of all the reading and thinking people of the country . The formality of signing the resolutions was made as impressive as possible ; the provinces being called in alphabetical order . The . first to sign was Baron Stewart of Bessarabia , a gentleman of British descent and a typical Tory . '  |p789  A deputation of five members was appointed to present the resolutions to Prince Mirsky for transmittal to the Emperor . The minister declined to receive the deputation , as he did not wish to recognize the official character of the conference . He was , however , at home to Dmitry N. Shipov , for many years president of the Moscow provincial zemstvo ; and he told Mr. Shipov that he was sympathetically disposed toward the resolutions , speaking generally , but that the decision did not rest with him . He would report the matter to the Emperor . What will be the result ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an accomplished fact . After countless rebuffs of their efforts to take even the most petty measures in concert , the zemstvos have , in circumstances ereated in part by Oyama and Togo , succeeded in holding a sort of congress in the imperial capital , and in securing the presentation of their views to the Emperor . The constitutionalists are , for the most part , not naive enough to expect the immediate concession of their demands . Nevertheless they regard November 19 , the day the conference assembled , as a milestone in Russian history . The precedent thus set will never be forgotten , and the program they formulated will shape political thought in Russia for an indefinite period . The conference has put the Russian public in a buoyant frame of mind unparalleled since the beginning of the reign of Alexander II . It has also disclosed the fact , beyond cavil or doubt , that the reading and thinking public , excepting a small percentage which some estimate as low as five , is behind the demand for personal liberty , for the sway of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of popular representation . It is understood that the Emperor has consulted his relatives , who now largely monopolize the influence they shared with the great noblesse during the two preceding reigns , and that , while the grand dukes strenuously opposed any concessions , the  |p790  grand duchesses and the two Empresse urged a conciliatory attitude . Prince G E. Lvov , who recently returned from Man churia , where he represented the zemstvo in Red Cross work , was received by th Empress Marie at the close of the confer ence . She asked him about the conference and when he took leave said , " Of one thing I can assure you : Plehve will not rise again . " The most trustworthy opinion regarding the Emperor 's attitude is that he is more and more inclined to mystical views , and that he looks upon the birth of his son a a sign from heaven that it is his mission to preserve the autocracy undiminished a the heritage of the Romanov dynasty . The constitutionalists and their more radical allies do not count upon that natu ral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratuitously , by the foreign press and repudiated by him as long ago as his accession to the throne . If his Majesty is opposed to the zemstvo demands , they will try to convert him to their way of thinking . They hope to convince him that a constitutional monarch has more real power than an autocrat . It is with reluctance that I pursue this theme , but it is no secret in Russia that the attitude of a numerous section of educated people in that country toward their sovereign has latterly undergone a rapid change . It was previously accepted , partly sincerely , in part as a matter of policy borrowed from constitutional governments , that the Emperor was favorably disposed toward constitutionalism , but that his ministers and others hindered him in the adoption of his beneficent plans . The existence of a liberal minister in the only ministry which now exercises any influence in such matters necessarily suggests a different view , and patriotic Russians of all classes hope that the Emperor will realize that he has begun to stand before his subjects in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting over-confidently . As long as he is minister , the administration will be more lenient than under his predecessors ; but he is a man of feeble health , and is too loyal an officer to attempt to cross the will of the Emperor . For the moment it appears to suit all parties for him to remain minister . It gives the Emperor time for reflection , and the people an opportunity for the legal expression of their requirements . The zemstvos , in regular session in December and January , were expected to continue the agitation on the basis of the conference program ; the marshals of nobility have declared their adhesion to the principal demands of the theses ; and preparations are being made for a conference of the mayors of the cities and towns . This agitation is being reinforced by more or less turbulent occasional meetings , and in some places by street demonstrations . Almost coincident with the zemstvo conference was a meeting ? held , of course , in the utmost secrecy ? of delegates from eight of the eighteen principal socialist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present time . The initiative was taken by a few Finnish radicals in connection with the newly organized constitutional party , the " Emancipation Alliance . " Three of the parties invited refused to send delegates , and seven neglected to do so without explaining . This effort to bring about the cooperation of organizations representing the majority of the racial elements of educated Russia is without a parallel in the history of the country , and , though only partly successful in its inception , is a fact of great moment.l The Emancipation Alliance , recently organized , is without definite social tenets , and is designed to furnish a nucleus for the federation of all opposition parties in so far as they pursue political aims . The opposition party conference adopted resolutions recognizing the struggle for national rights and against Russification as of equal  |p791  importance with that for constitutional government . The program includes the replacing of the autocracy by a regime founded on universal suffrage , the repeal of all measures aimed at the constitutional rights of Finland , and the right of all nationalities in Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Emancipation Alliance have drafted a constitutional project along the lines of the two conferences , which has been sold almost openly . It places the constitutional rights of Finland beyond reach of amendment save by the concurrent legislation of the Finnish Diet and the Russian Parliament . The latter body is to have two houses , the upper being composed of representatives of the provincial zemstvos , from one to five each , according to population , and of cities with a population of 125,000 or more , while the members of the lower house are to be elected by direct popular vote . I do not think that I can do ' better than to imitate the example of the Russians themselves and to leave the question , " What will be the result ? " unanswered . Few venture to predict with confidence beyond a month ; many belieye the constitution will come , but whether during the next few months or the next few years they leave to the future . Desiring to present an all-sided and impartial view of the situation , so full of complexities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts , but to acquaint myself with the views of representatives of various leading tendencies . I was present at a reception of the zemstvoists given by their literary collaborators in St. Petersburg , and heard scores of speeches greeting November 19 as worthy to rank with July 4 and 14 . Numerous zemstvoists and authors , some of the highest rank after Tolstoy , gave me permission to quote their speeches and their private expressions , but those ac ( painted with Russia will approve the sparing use that I make of such permission . Besides , the program left little for the liberals to say . The cooler heads unreservedly agreed that the struggle had only begun . " We should not jubilate , but prepare for hard work , " said Prince Dolgorouky of Soudzha . " I believe that the movement for reform is too strong to be stifled , but it must not be forgotten that the machinery of our government is slow-moving and cumbersome . " The meeting was characterized by a retrospective rather than a prophetic attitude . The orators were disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for what had been accomplished , not forgetting such early champions as Alexander Hertzen , or such later and present-day figures asShedrin , Michailovsky , and Korolenko , who had created a basis for hope by disclosing the fact that the peasant , though unspeakably patient under almost inhuman trials , was not slavish by nature , but possessed of deep , though dumb , aspirations and capable of high cultivation , as had been proved by such writers as Chekhov , who was of peasant birth . In Moscow I had an opportunity of talking with Mr. Shipov , without question the leading zemstvoist of Russia , having been actively engaged in the Moscow zemstvo for thirty years . He is a Slavophil and was the leader of the more moderate section of the conference . Those who dare hope for a zemstvo minister think first of all of Mr. Shipov . He laughed heartily at this suggestion , but confessed himself a thorough optimist , believing that before long the Emperor will cordially and graciously meet many of the wishes expressed in the eleven theses . I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how many could be counted upon as supporters of liberal aspirations . " About a million , I suppose , " he answered . " Circles previously regarded as ultra-conservative now favor reforms . I think the time has come . " " No government was ever confronted by such a multitude of questions , " observed a Moscow university professor whose name would carry weight . " Our position is really unparalleled in history . Besides the war , we have problems of all kinds , social , economic , religious , political , and national . The government has committed many faults , has neglected the most necessary and most obvious reforms . I fear peasant uprisings , as in Poltava and Kharkov , and that would be horrible . The peasant , when roused , turns against all educated and propertied classes and individuals . The war must be continued at all hazards . To conclude peace without the restoration of the prestige of Russia would be an un/ thinkable calamity . We have a long Chi nese frontier which , so far , our prestige ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to maintain an army o guards as great as our present forces i Manchuria . I can see no outlet except a appeal to the people , since the bureaucrac has gone into bankruptcy in both foreig and domestic affairs . I do not venture t say how soon the Emperor will realize this but realize it he must sooner or later . " I turn now to quarters which would be expected to hold conservative views His Excellency S. J. Witte , President o the Committee of Ministers , received m f or an hour on the Sunday following th zemstvo conference . He at once warned me that if I sought an interview I might a well lose no time ; but when I suggested that the financial side of the war and the connection of the war with the interna situation were eminently fit subjects fo discussion by him , he said : " I am entirely willing to discuss the finances of Russia Many people abroad continue to ask whether we can go on facing the financia situation brought about by the war . I affirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to begin another war our finances would stand the strain . The war will not end on account of failing financial resources on the part of Russia When it began I gave my opinion , officially that if we should succeed , in the end , in defeating the Japanese , it would be by virtue of our superior finances . The Japa nese can not resist our finances . I have no thing to say of the other two factors ? the army and navy . Perhaps the Japanese can carry on the war one and a half , two ? a the most , two and a half years . Consider ing the finances alone , we can keep it up for four years . Other factors being lef out of account , the Japanese can therefore be brought to sue for peace by their finan cial ruin . " I have been criticized for ten years by people that did not understand my aims I have been criticized for establishing re serves , for imposing high duties , and fo allowing too little for public education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I had other combination in mind . I was thinking of a war in Eu rope , not with Japan . I can not disclose all the grounds I had for expecting war but statistics afford sufficient reason for ex pecting a war at or near the beginning of this century . We had been at peace for more than twenty-five years , and I ask you how often the history of Europe can show a period of unbroken peace exceeding twenty-five years " The minister of finance has not touched a penny of the reserves , and as ? , long as we have them we have credit and could begin a second war with the same reserves . People abroad would do well to abandon all notions that Russia will be forced to abandon the war for want of money . " I repeat , our financial position is excellent . Sometimes the financial situation is good and the economic situation unsatisfactory , and vice versa . Russia and France may be taken as illustrations of the two cases . Ask me which I prefer , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but facts are facts. ? I ventured to suggest that the explanation in the case of Russia was , in part , the historical habitude of the people to share their income with the government to a relatively larger extent than most other peoples , and his Excellency assented . " However , do not imagine , " he added , " that the economic situation of the country is going to interfere with the prosecution of the war . This would be an error . " Interesting as is all that comes from the lips of Mr. Witte , the foregoing would have no place in the present inquiry except that it is generally supposed that the war , which has largely created the present internal situation , may determine the further course of events at home ; that the conclusion of a humiliating peace would shatter the reputation of the government , even if it did not overthrow the dynasty , as one patriotic editor fears , while a decisive Russian victory would greatly weaken the reform parties , even if it did not , as some fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people freely express the hope that the Japanese arms will continue to be crowned with victory . Of course this is not the attitude of thousands of others who support all or the greater part of the zemstvo demands . " I am for reforms , but not for the reform , " said Alexis S. Souvorin , editor of the " Novoe Vremya , " who demands the carrying on of the war to the utmost . " We are all agreed about the necessity of personal  |p793  liberty , a press law guaranteeing a reasonable measure of freedom of utterance , and , in fact , about nearly everything the zemstvo conference asks for except a parliament on the lines it suggested . We do not need a constitution , however , at this moment . Our revolution must come from above , not from below . A popular uprising or a movement against the will of the Emperor is impossible . The constitution will come sometime in the future ; how long it will be , I dare not predict . " What I should like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . There you have States and Territories , the latter possessing franchises and rights in accordance with their development and requirements . You do not give your Indians full citizenship . We have many Indians of our own . I like your Congress . It is not a debating society . It acts ; it talks much less than the parliaments of Europe . We want two houses , ? the Council of State and the Chamber of Deputies , ? and I should like to see more deliberation in committees than formal oratory . " I am not for equality . The natives of the ' Caucasus and of Asia and parts of European Russia , and the Jews throughout the country , can not be allowed equal rights with Russians . My opinion about the Jews is perhaps wholly personal . I think that the Russian mission must be to cause the dispersal of the Jews proportionately over the whole world . How ? By keeping them uncomfortable here . They would eat us up if they had equal rights . The Great and Little Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They should all have equal rights before the law , without distinction of class ; though I see no reason why class distinctions should be abolished entirely . They are matters of no great importance when no privileges are involved . I favor the convo cation of some sort of assembly to conside the situation ? perhaps a general assembly at St. Petersburg , perhaps local assemblie in the provinces . " Yes ; it is true that aristocratic soci ety is largely supporting the demand fo reforms , and that there is a very large ma jority throughout the country for a con stitution , but not for the precise form o constitution favored by the zemstvos . W want an advisory parliament only ; th Emperor must remain absolute . He must be allowed to pronounce for or against the majority . It is just as I said . We want something like what you have . Your President has the veto power . " I hope that we shall have reforms . I think the Emperor favors them , but does not know what shape they should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform of the zemstvo , and other changes , but not the zemstvo constitution . He is a soldier and absolutely correct in his conception of his duty toward his sovereign . " What I fear most is our lack of discipline and party coherence ? in other words , our political unripeness . We have no parties , but only groups . Turbulence may spoil everything . " " The future of the reform movement will depend , in my opinion , " said Prince Meshchersky , editor of the " Grazhdanin , " " upon the attitude of the zemstvos toward the government and , especially , toward Prince Mirsky . If the members of the conference , which bore an entirely private character , carry their program into the provincial zemstvo assembliesin December , and if these assemblies vote addresses to the Emperor asking for reforms of a general political nature , it is evident that such addresses will share the fate of all those that have preceded them , and will find their way into the archives of the ministry of the interior . If , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the amour propre of the zemstvo leaders , it is the government that will initiate the reforms necessary for the welfare of the country , the program of which has been broadly and clearly traced in the Emperor 's manifesto of February , 1903 . In this case the zemstvos will assuredly not only be called upon to take a large part in the work of elaborating reforms , but will have a vast field of activity in the sphere of self-government which will be delivered from the yoke of bureaucratic centralization . I hold that the latter way is preferable for the best interests of the country , and that , if an entente were established between the zemstvo and the government ; based on the same appreciation of the interests of the people , the provincial reform , realized on a solid foundation , would prepare the ground for the reforms to be accomplished in the sphere of the central government ,  |p794  which , without touching the principle of the autocracy of the sovereign , would be able to afford Russia and the Russians , without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is to say , liberty of the press , liberty of conscience and of religious confession , the inviolability of individual liberty , equality and the abolition of arbitrary government , ministerial responsibility to the Emperor subject to the supervision of the Senate , the right of each province to make representations to the Emperor directly about local requirements , and , finally , the right of each province to send a delegate to the Council of State for legislative work . " Such are the serious dreams of a Russian citizen who has grown old in the study of his nation and in the cult of its historic and national traditions . " The dreams of our liberals , who are solicitous above all for the glory and the success of the European doctrines on the subject of the constitutional regime , would be far more difficult to realize ; for they would require a long struggle between some tens of thousands of liberals and the government supported by 150,000,000 loyal subjects of the Russian autocrat , at the close of which the government and these 150,000,000 Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals . " The " Grazhdanin , " in the issue following the zemstvo conference , made a furious attack upon Prince Mirsky . It characterized the zemstvo proposals , and the state of mind into which they had thrown the society of the capital , as symptoms of political bedlam ; intimated that a liberal minister was a monstrosity ; and , with wellconceived finesse , contrasted with the effect of Prince Mirsky 's words the impression made by the Emperor 's February manifesto , which also spoke of the neces sity of harmonious relations between the government and the people and promised numerous important reforms . The greates document issued since the emancipation era had passed like a summer sigh , whil Mirsky 's utterances were raging like a cyclone . Was it possible that Mirsky wa able to promise more than the Emperor The minister met this attack by confis cating the issue . Orders were even given t demand the return of copies that had al ready been delivered to subscribers . Men . sures had already been taken to curb th exuberance of the liberal press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastened its appearance in order to be coincident with the opening of the conference , and which speedily attained a sale of 35,000 copies a day , was , after the fourth issue , deprived of the right to be distributed except to regular subscribers . It is a pity that the authority of a name not less than any of those already quoted can not be given to the following talk . Prince Mirsky would hear from an exceptionally competent source a wholly different estimate of the strength of the reform forces . " Nearly everything in the zemstvo theses are matters upon which everybody is agreed , " said this authority . " I shall not talk of the demand for a parliament , " he continued . " No sensible person , however , denies the necessity of personal and religious liberty , freedom of the press and of every opportunity for the development of individual and social initiative and independence of action . " He fully indorsed the view I have cited of the Emperor 's way of looking at the demands for a constitution . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the foreign press has always attributed different sentiments to his Majesty ; and in Russia , when he mounted the throne , it was confidently believed that he wanted to introduce many reforms . Were those who refused to accept the rebuke of the Tver zemstvo , for its faltering expression of a hope for a better state of things , as a true index of the Emperor 's feelings , in error , and have his Majesty 's views and disposition undergone a change in recent years ? " The only answer was a quizzical look and a shrug of the shoulders . I mentioned that Prince Mirsky seemed to be firm in his seat . He said this was true , but that Mirsky- 's strength consisted mainly in his entire willingness to abandon his portfolio at any moment .. Mirsky was not entirely comfortable in his position . He had made no direct promises , but his well-meant words had encouraged hopes , and he would be unwilling to remain in office if he were to be required to disillusionize these expectations . I mentioned Mr. Witte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the financial exhaustion of Russia , and asked if it were not possible  |p795  that other causes ? perhaps domestic events ? might tend to influence the Emperor to conclude peace . " Certainly , " he admitted . " The situation is undoubtedly grave ; but I beg you totconsider Russia as a whole , and not to devote yourself exclusively to the liberal minority . Russia is like the sea . The waves and billows and tides rise and fall and have their periods of storm and calm . The depths underneath remain comparatively still ; their broad currents are unaffected by the turbulence on the surface . Take all the educated classes , all the young men of the schools and universities , all the factory hands ? in fact , all classes that have been reached in any way by liberal ideas . They represent a population of a-few millions at most . " I interrupted to ask for an exact estimate . " Oh , never mind . Suppose there are five , ten , twenty millions . There remain more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can speak for them ? Not the zemstvos , in which they have very little part . Nobody has the right to speak for the peasant . He has no voice . He remains dumb and calm , and his psychology is a riddle . " " Does not this absolute separation of the classes almost wholly remove the peasant from the problem altogether ? " I asked . " He is neither for nor against changes and proposals of which he knows nothing ; he will neither help nor oppose the zemstvo , apparently . Can one not say that the numerical smallness of the upper strata gives the doings of the various little groups that compose it all the more apparent importance ? " " I do not say that the upper strata are not of very great importance , or that the present agitation of these strata , and the students ' and workingmen 's demonstrations , are insignificant . They are tremendously significant ; but the deep strata , the masses , remain unmoved . Therefore a revolution ? political changes based on physical force ? is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present ? " I asked . " Who are the reactionists ? " returned my interlocutor . " All thinking people are agreed on the zemstvo propositions , excepting some of the last ones ; but some people in the court circles are anxious to preserve their positions . None of these grand dukes are persons of any intellectual force . " The liberals , who have so often had a powerful advocate in Count Leo N. Tolstoy when engaged in purely negative opposition to the government , definitively parted company with him when they stepped forth with a definite constructive program . Considering that the silence of Count Tolstoy is not to be reckoned with , and that his political influence on all classes is , though partial only , undeniable , I sought an opportunity to learn from his own lips what he thought of the reform . movement . What he said was of course not all new , but I thought it best to present his ideas as he developed them to me . I had a number of long conversations with him at different times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . He asked me what I knew of the movement , and how it impressed me ; and I frankly stated that the zemstvo proposals appeared to me to be moderate and adapted to the country . " And I think they are nonsense , " he said . " All governments are bad . They instigated the inquisition and torture , and were responsible for the death of Christ and the burning of Giordano Bruno , etc . The day will come when we shall ask ourselves how governments , how the regime of force , could be possible in these present times , just as we now ask how the inquisition and torture were possible some centuries ago . Think of your war with Spain ! " I urged that in this case public opinion had overridden the will of the President . " Public opinion has no armies and guns , " he rejoined ; " besides , it is not true that your government is unable to resist public opinion , since it tolerates the iniquities of the trusts . Governments are unnecessary . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of nobody else . Everything useful that governments accomplish can be done equally well by other agencies ? for example , stock companies . Many people get along very well without any government . The history of Siberia and of parts of the United States , notably Utah , furnishes numerous instances . The whole of our Chinese ? frontier has been settled by people who withdrew themselves from the power and the ken of the government . They thrived until the government found them out , and then their prosperity was at an  |p796  end . All who went of their own accord and got away from the government prospered , while those that the government fostered starved . " The best and most prosperous Russians are those who have renounced the state ? the Doukhobors and the Molokani . " What we need is the personal perfection of the individual . Nobody has a commission to set up a government , while each of us has a commission to perfect himself . Perfect the individual and the state will be unnecessary . In any case , the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to choose , just as it is hard to express a preference for one kind of poison rather than another . " The one thing needful is personal perfection , and political agitation hinders rather than fosters it . " Take America . You have virtually no hindrances to individual development , and you lynch negroes , form trusts , and adopt imperialism . Money and politics absorb all your energies and distract attention from the inner life . " Every country has its own peculiarities , and its government is more or less adapted to them . There is some truth in the Slavophil doctrine . I do not know what will be best for Russia ; but when the time for change comes , the form will settle itself . Take the peasants . They have little difficulty in arranging their practical affairs ? in finding out the wisest and best man for judge , for instance ; while the state makes a man a judge because he has passed a foolish examination , and the churches make a man a teacher because he has been graduated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . One had just been graduated from a Presbyterian seminary , and the other was going to be . And gray-haired old men will have to listen to them . " The moral regeneration of the individual requires no political regeneration as a condition precedent , and it will of itself dissolve governments founded on evil when the time comes . " You Americans have only yourselves to blame if you remain devoid of spiritual life ; for you neglect your great teachers , Emerson , Channing , Thoreau , Ballou , Garrison , Whittier . " I thought I saw an opening . Russia , too , had wise teachers , but many Russians could not read . The zemstvos displayed a laudable zeal for public education . Would this not argue in favor of the strengthening of their influence ? " Yes , thank God , many of the Russians can not read ! " he retorted , " if the best they can do , when they learn how , is to read newspapers and magazines . I know many Doukhobors who on principle refuse to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they require . I do not say this is commendable , but it proves that moral reformation is not dependent on the power to read . It is dependent on nothing but the individual himself . The state can not prevent it . It is impossible for a Christian to be a slave , because he obeys only his own conscience . " I do not favor the zemstvo proposals because the political speechifying , the vanity , greed , and lust of power , which parliamentary institutions foster , choke the soul . " Princess Obolensky , Count Tolstoy 's youngest daughter and faithful disciple , and the gracious mistress of the household in the temporary absence of Countess Tolstoy , mentioned another practical consideration which her father had urged the evening before . She said he held that the one great need of the peasantry was more land . She and her husband had sold their land on easy terms to the peasants . These now have good steel plows , have quit drinking vodka , send their children to school , and are eagerly inquiring about improved methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands of cattle to keep . The next village , composed of precisely the same sort of people , have copied none of these improvements , simply because they have so little land that they are hopeless . Perhaps , if the peasants were asked what they wanted , it would be something very different from the zemstvo proposals , which would , if adopted , transfer power from the Emperor to the landlords . Perhaps the peasants would prefer to let power remain in the hands of the Emperor . Moreover , this transfer of power might tend to perpetuate the present unjust distribution of the land , since an autocrat was more likely to compel a redistribution than the landlords were to consent to it . Besides , it was not to be overlooked that the constant , every-day interests of the landlords and of the peasants were contradictory , since the  |p797  poorer the peasants the cheaper their labor and the greater the profits of the landlords . BEFORE leaving , I had another conversation with Tolstoy , which , though a little aside from the main subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . He had returned to his study after dinner , but came back about ten o'clock with a manuscript in his hand . " It is Plato 's Phaedo , ' which I have just finished putting into a form intelligible to all . It contains the most beautiful things , but clouded by abstruse reasoning . " I passed a banal compliment on his industry . " I believe , with Kant , that there is no pure pleasure save rest after labor , " he answered , as with concentrated effort he conquered a refractory cup and ball with which he was playing , and leaped upon the back of a young Russian disciple and rode half-way around the dining-room . " I am getting old , but I can not stop working . There are so many things I want to do , I feel as if I could not work hard or fast enough . I have quit reading the newspapers . What do you think of that at my time of life ? It gave me a joy at first like that I felt when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the best time of day , the mind is clearer and more retentive then , and we ought to read the best thoughts of the best and wisest men in those early hours , rather than the newspapers .
