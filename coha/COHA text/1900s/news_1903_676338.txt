txt A rumor was cure rent to-night to the effect that Mrs. Maria Hull , mother-in-law of Edwin L. Burdick , who was murdered on Feb. 27 , had been seriously injured or was ill . Efforts were made to learn the facts in the case , but all requests at the Burdick residence for information were met by a refusal to discuss the subject .. A young man who said his name was Allen and that he was a friend of the family acted as spokesman . " I refuse to confirm or deny the story that Mrs. Hull was injured or that she . s in any than her usual health . " he said , " except to say that she is weakening under the terrible nervous strain to which she has been subjected and has not been herself since the trying experience on the witness stand . " Dr. Marcy , the family physician . in reply to a telephone message , stated that he had not been called to the Burdick home . If anything had happened to any member of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rev. L. M. Powers was shocked when he heard of the rumor . He declared that he had received no word from the house to-night . He did not believe the report . Police Justice Murphy announced to-day that owing to the illness of District Attorney Coatsworth the inquest into the murder of Edwin L. Burdick would not be resumed until next Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock . Mr Coatsworth is suffering from a sev  --  re cold , which prevents him from speaking above a whisper . It is expected that the inquest will be concluded on Monday unless some new evidence of importance develops this week . Mrs. Burdick , Burdick 's furnace man , and the man who tended the furnace for the Fennells will probably be called on Monday . It is stated on good authority that the District Attorney will also place in evidence a letter alleged to have been written to Mrs. Burdick by Arthur L. Pennell some months ago . It was found in the Burdick home when the search of the house was made by the police . In the letter these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill Ed Burdick . " When Mrs. Burdick is called to the stand ? Monday she will probably be called upon to identity the letter . She knew both the dead men . Burdick and Pennell , probably better than any one person , and her testimony promises to be the most important and Interesting of the entire proceedings . The details of the relations between the two men were gathered immediately after the murder of Burdick and before the death of Pennell . Pennell stated frankly to the authorities that the relations between himself and Burdick were " strained , ' " iiell " . - strained . " lie went into some details of his-relations ' with Mrs. Burdick and or his connection with Mr. Burdick . It was learned also of angry words that passed between ? Burdlek and Pennell at a meeting of the two men in an office with at least one other man near by . Burdick told his partner , Parke , of 1 having had a meeting with Pennell . After the murder of Burdick .

" It deals with Burdick , " said Pennell . " Some say that it comes with ill grace from me to abuse a dead man , but Burdick , was s no saint , and when the time comes that I must make a statement in the newspapers in defense of myself from what other newspapers are printing about me I intend to let people know just the kind of man he was , and then perhaps some of them will turn a little of their time to him that they now are devoting to prying into ' my affairs . 1 did not like him and he did not like me , and we both knew it and I have told the police frankly that we were not on grind terms . His death coming at this thy , ? was one of the worst things that could have ha ppened to me . " Additional significance was lent to-day to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Burdick. that he believed the murder was committed by " Arthur Pennell or a hired assassin . " The authorities , it appears , knew beforehand whom Mr. Parke was to name . The police and the District Attorney hail talked over the crime with Mr. Parke , and were aware of the trend of his suspicions . They know if they asked him on the stand who , in his belief , murdered Mr. Burdick his it  --  ply would be " Arthur Pennell . " Notwithstanding . ill the talk about Pennell. however , the authorities ore not consenting calmly to put the Burdick murder on to a dead man . There are several points to lie considered before this is accepted . One of the authorities is quoted as saying : " There are several reasons to believe three things : First . that the murder was committed by more than one person : second , that at . least one of the persons implieut , t1 was entind ? familiar with the interior of the Burdick home , and what perhaps is most important of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no fear of interruption while at their work or immediately afterward . Oil the first point T do not care to say much . As to the second point . I may point to the probability that after the work was done the murderer washed his or her hands , and therefore must have known where a wash basin was to be found . Although there was blood on the inside knob of the den door , there was no blood on the knob of the outer door to the house . " Familiarity with the house is also indicated by the probability that the luncheon was net brought to the den by Burdick . The analysis of the contents of his stomach shows that he had not tasted of a particle c.1 the crackers . cheese , and tarts found on the table in the den . Deliberation and freedom from fear of apprehension is indiefItt-d by the fact that the murderers took time to do many things which a person in fear of discovery would not have done . " It was ' carried to-day that Mr. Pennell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sole executrix in the event of her surviving . Three alternates are named to art should Mrs. Pennell die first . In view of the fact that Mrs. Pennell died so soon after her husband was killed , it was suggested that the executoirs named in the trill be allowed to act . The matter has not been definitely settled , and an administrator of the estate may be appointed by the court .
