IN the exuberant hospitality of America if a person wants anything he has only to ask for it . Whether he gets it , is another matter ; he will at least get something with the same name . In - London if one in his secret heart longs for something , he has only to leave the main thoroughfares and get lost . He finds himself in a maze of narrow streets where shopkeepers make a living by selling unheard-of things to people who have wandered in by accident . These shopkeepers never advertise . Their disposition is secretive , and they trust to the method of ambush . A person is walking along with only a vague impulse to find his way out without demeaning himself by asking advice of a policeman . He finds himself in front of a shop devoted to traffic in snails from Astrakhan . It is the sole emporium for these artichss . If the wayfarer be of an inquiring mind the unexpected supply wakens a demand , at least the demand for further knowledge . Who is there in all London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even know that it is here ? The dingy sign appeals not to his conscious aims but 10 a dim sub-conscious longing for he knows not what . It seems like a strange coincidence that he of all persons in the world should have come upon the only place in London where these articles are for sale . The chances are that if he be all American he will pluck up courage and venture in and ask the proprietor , " How 's the snail-trade to-day ? " The shopkeeper receives him without surprise . He knows that , according to the doctrine of probabilities , somebody is bound to turn up in his shop , sometime . To my mind this is the very romance of trade . Had I a moderate but assuredincome , as I trust all these London shopkeepers have , I should follow their example . I have 110 111011111011 to be a great " captain of industry , " and have the magazine writers tell the truth about me .

" And when they , in shamefaced fashion , confess their failure to have discovered inc they will fall in his esteem .

The sign above the door must have been recently painted , but the London smoke had already given it an air of grimy respectability . I rend with pleasure the legend , " The AngloAmerican School of Polite Unlearning . " I was gratified over my discovery . In- // slithiions of learning we have at home ? and some very good ones too ; but I realized that in the nature of things somewhere in London there must be an institution for the benefit of persons who are desirous , not so much of learning , but of being assisted to unlearn a number of things that are not good for them . And here it was . Like so many things in London , the moment I saw it , I felt that I had always seen it . A few moments later I was in familiar converse with the Principal of the school , who gave me the history of the institution from its inception . Ile was a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this age of educational fads it was a pleasure to find sonic one who adhered to very simple methods . We do not believe , " he said , " in what is called enriching the curriculum . When there ha ve accumulated such vast stores of misinformation , we do not think it wise to burden our pupils ' minds by trying to get them to unlearn everything . Such smattering has little educational value . We limit ourselves to seeing that a few things which make the people of one country obnoxious to the people of another shall be thoroughly unlearned . When we consider what soil and climate have done in developing our own splendid type of manhood , it is natural that we should think highly of our own national environment , but it is unfortunate that we should usually think so poorly of those whose environment has been different . Each nation ' holds a thought ' of its neighbors , and these thoughts are seldom altogether flattering . This is evidently a case for the application of mind cure . " Even with nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the American , the thoughts that are held are not always pleasing , especially when they sometimes forget their company manners . The adjective American is not usually found in conjunction with those heavenly twins , ' Sweetness and Light . ' Indeed , the suggestion is quite the opposite . Only when timed in connection with dentists does itimply undoubted excellence . In the United States the word British is not used as a term of endearment . " A good while ago Emerson declared that the English had good will toward America , but in their ordinary conversation they forgot their philosophy and remembered their disparaging anecdotes . Of course the difficulty lies partly in the nature of an anecdote . Those we tell about our best friends usually convey to a stranger the impression that they are half-witted . It would be possible to collect a vast number of anecdotes illustrative of the fact that most people will , under ordinary circumstances , act in a rational manner . The trouble with such anecdotes is that they are so hard to remember . " One is led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodwill . One of the most obvious methods is through the encouragement of travel . Railways and steamships by annihilating distance may , it is said , annihilate the enmities between nations . The more opportunities people have of seeing one another , the better friends they will be . This theory is such a credit to human nature that at first I accepted it without a question . " I looked at the growing passenger lists of the transatlantic steamers and thought of the peaceful invasion of our American cousins . here arc missionaries of good will . No collections ! Every man his own Missionary Board , paying his bills and diffusing the gospel of kindliness . Think of these fresh , enthusiastic missionaries who are continually seeing and being seen , appreciating and being appreciated .

" A friend who for many years had spent his summers in Switzerland remarked that the Germans are less popular than they were before their present era of prosperity . I asked the reason , and he answered , ' We see more of them now . ' I have known Germans who insisted that a visit to England did not cure Anglophobia , any more them the application of water would cure Hydrophobia , It might even aggravate the symptoms . That going to see people may have different effects is shown in our use of the words ' visit ' and ' visitation . ' Whether a visit shall seem like a visitation depends a good deal on the visitor .

A few months later , being in New York , I happened to mention his 11:011C to a gentleman to whom he had brought letters of introduction . It appeared that this gentleman had not recognized the admirable qualities which had made my Lancashire friend an ornament to his native city . He had however borne him no personal malice but had set down all his less pleasing characteristics to his nationality . After narrating several incidents illustrative of the general quality of pig-headedness , he added charitably , ' But what could you expect of a Britisher ?

He sets out with certain preconceived ideas which he uses alternately as a club with which to belabor the foreigners on their native heath , and as blinders to prevent himself from seeing anything new . Asa consequence , his little journey in the world does not add to the suns total of the amenities . " An Englishman goes to New York with the settled conviction that it ought to be just like London . When he discovers that it is n't , trouble begins . He accumulates inconvertible evidences of divergencies . It is too hot in summer and too cold in winter and too noisy all the time . The buildings are too high , and the lifts drop suddenly from under him , giving him a ' gone ' feeling that he does n't like . Above all there is it distressing dearth of afternoon tea . With the best intentions in the world he points out these defects of a crude civilization . He waxes didactic . These things , my brethren , ought not so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .

" The American in the old country makes himself obnoxious in the same way . He starts out with the assumption that London is and of right ought to be a bigger Seattle . It has bad plenty of time , and if it is not up-todate it argues a mental defect on the part of its citizens . He is disappointed in what he sees . The belated people still go about on omnibuses and seem to like it . The telephone service is beneath contempt , and the ordinary business man does only one thing at a time . This is all wrong , and with the zeal of a missionary lie urges the native islanders to ' get busy . ' He explains to them the defects in their education . On the slightest provocation he indulges in statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase in population since the last census . IIe is annoyed because they refuse to be astonished at these things and reserve their surprise for his incidental revelations of the methods of municipal politics . He is thoroughly kind . He is careful to make them understand that he does not wish to offend against any of their inherited prejudices . That attitude which Lowell described as a certain condescension in foreigners ' is not confined to any one nation , It seems to be the most natural thing in t he world for the foreigner as foreigner . When a person leaves his home and becomes , for the time being , a foreigner , he is likely , unless he has had the benefit of a school like ours , to retain his home standards of judgment . IIe passes rather severe verdicts on what he sees , and imagines that he renders them agreeable by expressing them in the most conciliatory tones .

The sudden altercations that seem to come like bolts out of the clear sky must have some reason .

It seemed that the Queen and all the imperial pomp made very little impression on her mind , she had been so interested in herself . She told how , at considerable expense , she had secured a good seat . " ' hen I looked down and saw a ragged little boy . I called him to conic up with me , and I wrapped him in an American flag which I always take with me . And there I sat all clay , " The Genius of America protecting the British Poor .

Its aim is to rid the foreigner in as short a time as possible of the preconceived notions of his own superiority . These notions if left unchecked would have prevented his getting any good of his travels , as well as making him more or less of a nuisance to the people among whom he happened to he . We intend to enlarge our institution gradually until we have branches in all the great capitals . We will teach Frenchmen that their ideas of Germany are all wrong , and eventually we may solve the Eastern question by convincing the Russians , Bulgarians , Macedonians , Servians , Turks , and others , that they do not really know so much to each other 's discredit as they have for centuries been led to suppose .

" The customs regulations might do something . The United States has already adopted the policy of forbidding the importation on regular lines of steamships of certain ideas . On entering an American port the passenger is asked whether he has in his possession any anarchistic opinions . If he makes the declaration in due form , he is immediately deported . This has had an excellent effect in keeping out anarchists whose veracity is above the normal ; though for those of the baser sort there is a great opportunity for smuggling . In like manner we might have the customs officers anticipate the newspaper reporters , and ask each foreigner before landing what he thinks of the country . If he reveals a set of opinions that are not likely to be modified by further experience he might be sent back at t he expense of the steamship company . All this however is of purely academic interest . For the present , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise he will welcome any aid in getting rid of the opinions which stand in the way of his pleasure and profit . Our school attempts to minister to this need . Here for example is a middle-aged Englishman who is contemplating a visit to America . He has a number of ideas in regard to what he calls ' the States , ' and he is much attached to those ideas . He has not had occasion clearly to differentiate ' the States ' from ' the colonies ; ' they are all alike a long way off . Ile thinks of the States as Brit isle colonies that got themselves detached a long time ago from the apron-strings of the mother country . Since then they have been going to the dogs more or less without knowing it . They have fallen into the hands of trusts and dissenters . They have taken to over-educating the lowerclasses and under-educating the upper classes , till you ca n't tell which is which . In their use of the English language liberty has degenerated into license , as it always does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak correctly . Their pronunciation is utterly barbarous , and now they are endeavoring to conceal their offenses by getting us to spell the language as they pronounce it . They are always talking about the dollar , which is a very different thing from our silent respect for shillings and pence . Their children are intolerable , owing to their precocious imitation of the manners of their elders . While boastful of their liberty they are curiously submissive to tyranny , and if their newspapers are to be believed , they universally cower in the presence of a janitor . In their public conveyances they hang to straps and gasp for air in a manner pitiable to behold . All these tortures they endure with stoical fortitude , which they have learned through their long intercourse with the lied Indians . " Ile is aware that in the States he will hear a deal of ' tall talk ; ' this he is prepared to discount . A very safe rule to observe is not to believe anything that sounds large . " The American business men , he understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prodigiously active , but their activity is providentially lit oiled by dyspepsia and nervous prostration . He is inclined to attribute the physical break-down of the race to the universal consumption of Chicago tinned meals . On the whole , however , he has a friendly feeling toward the people of the States . They are doing as well as could be expected of such people , under the circumstances . They have already , in their immature civilization , produced 50111e men whose names are household words ? there was Artemus Ward and Fenimore Cooper and Mark Twain and Buffalo Bill . This proves that after all blood is thicker than water . " Ile starts on his travels very much as // the elder brother in the parable might have done had he thought to pay a visit to the prodigal in the far country .

After three months he will have returned having every one of his opinions confirmed by a dozen instances . And he will have left behind him a score or inure Americans confirmed in their opinion as to what a typical Britisher is like . " Ilow much better for him to enter our school before engaging his passage westwrd . Here , surrounded by all the comforts of home , he could begin the painful but necessary process of unlearning . Each day sve would examine him and lied out his fixed opinion and flatly conmillet. it .

Our object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion that there is one rigid way of doing things , and that all other ways arc wrong . We want to teach him to be content to say simply that the other ways arc different . When he has learned rather to like the differences , and to he interested in finding out why they are as they are , we give him a diploma . " A great deal of our time is spent over the bare rudiments . You may have noticed ns you came in , in the little classroom to the left , a gentleman unwillingly engaged in studying a large wall map of Oklahoma . Ile is an Oxford man who wakes his living writing for the reviews . I le lately expressed the intention of visit ing America . His friends felt that he was not in a fit state , and advised him to take a short course in our school simply as a precautionary measure .

We have had to put bins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that he had a most inadequate idea of the extent of the American Union , and had always looked upon the States as corresponding to the English counties . This of itself would have been no detriment to him if his geographical ideas had been held only as a part of the equipment of a modest ignorance . It would have endeared him to his American friends , who would have been only too happy to set him right . But unfortunately he is not the kind of a man who can be set right with impunity . When any one would tell Trim the distance from New York to San Francisco it would not make the slightest impression on his mind . He would set it down as a piece of American brag . We have found that the best way is to give him set tasks . We have dissected maps of Europe and America drawn to the same scale , and we make bins put the map of Great Britain into the map of Texas and calculate the marginal area . Then we have memory work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Missouri-Mississippi , and the number of vessels passing every year through the Detroit River . We set before him the latest railway map of the United States and ask him to tell at sight which railways belong to Hill and which to Harriman , and since when ? When he asks what difference it makes , we rebuke his impertinence , and keep bins after school . We give him daily themes to write . For example we present this text from Sam Slick : They are strange folks , Rums English . On particulars they know more than any people ; but on generals they are as ignorant as owls . The way they do n't know some things is beautiful . ' " What national characteristics did Mr. Samuel Slick of Sliekville , Connecticut , 414 The Anglo-American School of Polite Unlearning have in mind when lie made these animadversions ? Is the dislike for general ideas really necessary to the stability of the British Constitution ? Is Mr. Slick 's criticism sufficiently answered by pointing out the fact that it is couched in language that seriously conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion I gave him these lines from one of our own poets : ? " " rho house of Peers throughout the war Did nothing in partieular , And did it very well .

Give your opinion as to the comparative value of the two legislative bodies . Indicate on the margin whether you consider a person who holds the opposite opinion to be hellcat It your contempt , or just worthy of it ? " Yesterday I gave him an item from the sporting columns of a San Francisco newspaper . After describing the strenuous physical exercises of a distinguished pugilist , the writer adds : ' O'Brien is diligently using his leisure time in study . It is his intention when retiring from the ring to devote himself exclusively to literary pursuits . To this end he has engaged a tutor and under his direction is reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dante , and Homer . ' " Use this paragraph as a text for a sarcastic article on the absurdities of popular education and the chaotic condition of a society in which anybody feels competent to study anything he has a mind to . After having done this to your own satisfaction look at the subject from another point of view . Granted that you with your excellent classical education Inc more capable of appreciating Homer , ask which one would Homer be more likely to appreciate , you or O'Brien ? We are now making use of the phonograph , which repeats for him choice extracts from American newspapers andmagazines devoted to making the world familiar with the growth of the country . This familiarizes Mtn , through the ear , with certain uncongenial habits of thought . " The Principal led me for a moment into the entry , and looking through the door we saw the Oxford man in a dejected attitude listening to the phonograph , which was monotonously informing him of the glories of Chicago and the exact floor-space of Marshall Field 's store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the principal , on returning to his own room , and he might as well do so now . I fear , however , I may have been too severe in the training , and that he may be going stale . Ile told me this morning that perhaps he might give up his American trip and take a little ran up to 13ilawy instead . " The real difficulties are always those that lie in the background of the mind and therefore are hard to get at . The traveler insists on putting everything into the same categories he uses at home , and sometimes they wo n't fit . Englishmen , for example , have got used to dividing themselves into three distinct classes , and when they come to a community where these divisions are not obvious they regard it with suspicion , as they would an egg in which the distinction between the white and the yellow is not as clearly marked as in the days of its first innocency . " I have been reading the hook of a clever writer who discourses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne ' - ; ea no recognized upper class and no plainly marked lower class , and so he drew the conclusion that all Americans belong to the middle class . Then he attributed to them all the characteristics which middle-class Englishmen of IL litentry turn of mind are always attributing to their own class . But this is fallacious . In my youth we used to amuse ourselves by beheading words . We would ruthlessly behead a word and then curtail it . But // when the middle letters were relieved of their terminal incumbrances and set up as an independent word , that word had a craning of its own . My own opinion is that we middle-class Englishmen are pretty fine fellow 's , and that we are most respects superior to our betters ; but if we had n't 0110 class to look up to and another to look down on , I doubt whether We should feel middle-class at all . We should feel , as do our American brethren , that we are the whole show . " " A most difficult matter is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It goes against all heir preconceived notions of the fitness of things . The airy way in which an American will mention the most distressing present moral conditions and assure you that everything is as bad as it can be , and is coining out all right , irritates them . It seems to argue a state of ethical inconsequence . ' You ca n't pin these fellows down to hard facts , ' a pupil complained to me , ' the pin wo n't hold . ' " " That 's just it , ' I answered , the facts these people are dealing with are not hard , they are fluid . In the old world social facts are hard , they have been solidified by the pressure of population exerted for generations . In the vast spaces of America this pressure has as yet been little felt .

And the remarkable thing is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts iire flowing . You ca n't nail them ; the best thing you can do is to float on them . The American is not a worshiper of things as they are , his curiosity is aroused by the things that arc going to " We try to make our students , through a variety of illustrations of rapid change , lhat mostly in the right direction , see that there is some justification for the American expectation that when things are pretty bad they are about to be bett er .

They do n't take very much room , for they have grown close together . They are not much to look at . They are shaken till they are pretty evenly distributed and each one feels the genial warmth of a general prosperity . Then they begin to expand , not in a quiet fashion but in a series of small explosions , each individual popping out of his shell and surprised that he takes up so much room in the world .

" I anticipate great pleasure , " said the Principal , " from my American pupils , when once they find their way here , for 1 am told that they unlearn easily .

Then , when the legal time for laughter has expired according to the statute of limitation , he acknowledges his liability and pays his debt of merriment , with deferred interest . The American argues that his mental processes , though sure , are somewhat slow . " But if we had Courts of Humor as in the days of chivalry they had Courts of Love , I should like to present these cases for adjudication . I should argue that the anecdotes do not prove a deficiency in humor so much as a higher standard of rectitude . The Englishman is not less quick than the American to see a point , but when lie does not see it he is less likely to conceal the fact . If he suspects that there is a poor little joke concealed somewhere , he does not find it in his heart to allow it to perish of neglect , but returns to it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . " " I shall endeavor , " said the Principal , " to get them , if not to unlearn , at least to moderate the ' Old Home ' idea . Every American , no matter where his family originated , likes to think of England as the Old Home . It satisfies his historic sense and gives him the feeling that he is revisiting the green graves of his sires . " Once arrived at the Old Home he goes about in search of the quaint and venerable . his head is chock-full of more or less vague historical and literary allusions which lie is anxious to attach to their proper localities , He is on the lookout for the people he has read about . Ile would not be surprised to meet Falstaff or Mr. Pickwick when lie turns the corner . I was myself taken for Mr. Pickwick once , and I did n't like it .

I tell you it touches a soft . spot in your heart to come back to the Old lIome . ' To the alert , public-spirited , intensely modern Englishman who is eager to show him the latest thing in municipal housekeeping this is disconcerting . " " Yes , " I said , " I think I understand . If I were a prosperous planter away down on the Suwanee liver , and were anxious to show my visitor the brandnew mansion 1 had built with the proceeds of my last year 's cotton crop , I should object to his striking a sentimental attitude and warbling the ditty about the ' old folks at home . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old folks . " " That is the trouble , " said the Principal , " with living in a place that has become a household word . The traveling public seems like a many-headed monster with only one idea . When the idea is a trivial one and keeps popping up continually , it becomes tiresome . There for instance is Banbury , a thriving market town . The present inhabitants are eminently progressive , and the town bears all Ilse evidences of prosperity . 13ut when the train draws up in the summer , one may hear girlish American voices exclaiming , I low fascinating ! Is n't it too cunning for anything ! Bide a cock horse . ' And they look out upon the Banbury peop'e as if they belonged to an immemorial nursery . " The Americans ignore the political divisions of the country , and acknowledge only the divisions into the Scott country , the Burns country , the Wordsworth country , the Shakespeare country , the Dickens country , and the Lorna Doone country . We sometimes wonder where they think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we must remember that though it limy be tiresome to the inhabitants to have a few associations recurring continually , a great part of the pleasure of travel consists in comparing our previous impressions with what we see . There was that most delightful of English wayfarers , George Borrow ; he was doing that all the time . " ' On arriving at Chester , ' he says , ' at which place we intended to spend two or three days , we put up at an old-fashioned inn in Northgate Street to which we had been recommended . My wife and daughter ordered tea and its accompaniments ; and I ordered ale and that which should always accompany it , cheese . " The ale I shall find laid , " said I ; " Chester ale had a bad reputation since the time of old Sion Tudor , who made a first-rate Englyn about it , but I shall have a treat in the cheese ; Cheshire cheese has always been reckoned excellent . " ' " To his great delight he found the ale as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore he hilariously threw it out . of the window . Then tasting the cheese , he found the cheese bad also , and promptly threw that after the ale , ' Well , ' he said , ' if I have been deceived in the cheese , at any rate I have not been deceived in the ale , which I expected to find execrable . Patience ! I shall not fall into a passion , more especially as there are things I can fall back upon . Wife ! I will trouble you for a cup of tea . Henrietta , have the kindness to cut me a slice of bread and butter . ' Now it is evident that Borrow had two distinct pleasures in his visit to Chester . The ale was as bad as from his previous reading of the Welsh bards he had been led to suppose , and the cheese was worse . ' Ile pleasure in each case came from the fact that his experience had reacted upon his previous ideas . After all , this is a harmless sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in a bluff , whole-souled Briton like Borrow , there could be no harm in throwing the ale and cheese around , just for the sake of auld tang sync ; but it is different with a vulgar rich Am Pardon me , 1 ton falling into the bad habits of my pupils . " " I take no offense , " I said ; ' you know I am not rich . " We shall , " he said , " deal tenderly with the literary and historical treasures which our pupils bring with them , but we shall endeavor to teach them to use their excellent gifts in such a way that the Past may not altogether obscure the Present . " " Another idea , " said the Principal , is that of the tight little island . ' It is a term that the British themselves delight in ; but it should be remembered that diminutives , while very endearing when used in the family circle , are less pleasing when taken up by strangers . The American expects to find the British quite insular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertaining to an island , surrounded by water , opposed to continental . ' The real quesMin is , what effect has being surrounded by water upon the mind ? Is water , especially when it is salt , a conductor or nonconductor of cosmopolitan sympathies ? The dictionary takes the latter view and goes on to the slurring secondary definition , ' characteristic of the inhabitants of islands , hence , narrow , contracted . ' " Why ' hence , narrow , contracted ' ? It would seem as if the dictionary man had been consorting with land-lubbers and had taken their point of view . One would suppose from his reasoning that the sea cut one off from communication with the rest of the world , while prairies and mountains were the true highways of nations . This is not the doctrine of the Blue-water school . It is based on the recognition of the broadening effect of an insular position . There is no place so easy to get at or to get away from as an island . It makes us next-door neighbors to the ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships , we 've got the men , we 've got the money too . It is your dweller in is section of is continent who is shut in , ' hence , narrow , contracted . ' Your islander knows no such narrow bounds as he sings his victorious Song of the Seven Seas . If this be insularity make the most of it ! " At this moment the door-bell rang and it shy individual appeared whom I took to be the first American student .
