SIR ? Does the Russian language present such hard problems to the translator that it is impossible to render the writings of a Russian into English without destroying the author 's style , and without making the most patent blunders ?

The much-heralded ' roma Gordyeeff ' ( Gordeyev ) of the abundantly advertised Russian Gorky has now appeared in two translations A few passages taken at random will illustrate the difficulties of the reader . Not being able to read Russian , I am unable to say which version is correct , and to decide I shall probably have to refer to the French or German translation EUGENE LIMEDORPER.
