At last Poe has come into his own His text was long the most neglected in our native literature ; it is now , if not the best , certainly the most edited of all Our classics can not be too often issued , and both these new editions have , each in its own way , novel points of excellence unshared by others The coincidence of their publication strongly emphasizes the established place of Poe in our standard literature , and the care with which his fame is cherished . The Virginia edition is , indeed , an old-fashioned labor of love , the work of three gentlemen of the University of Virginia where Poe was educated , and sets him forth with local pride as a Virginia product . The more sumptuous " Arnheim Edition " of Messrs . Putnam , introduced . by Professor Richardson of Dartmouth College , presents Poe exclusively as a " world-author " In other respects , the two editions are also opposed , and , if the former receives greater attention here , it is because of its unusual claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in substance , and is content to take its place with others . The Virginia editors are of a different mind They endeavor to reconsti- tute the text ; they claim that they have freed it from the corruptions of other editors , and that it is now presented in its original integrity for the first time . Such a claim  --  the question being what is the standard text of one of our most distinguished authors  --  deserves scrutiny . The first point made by the Virginia editors ( and it is often reiterated ) is , that they have gone to the original sources . A hasty reader might get the impression that they only had done so . Griswold , of course , had the original sources , as Poe 's executor , for so much of Poe 's work as he included in his edition It is not the fact of going to the sources that counts , but rather the use one makes of them . Griswold attempted no more than a fairly good reprint of what seemed permanent or interesting in the miscellaneous papers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still to be judged . The edition so made served its purpose until , with the increase of Poe 's fame and the lapse of time , something more seemed due him . Stedman and Woodberry then gave a new edition ; they went to the original sources , rearranged the matter , modernized the mode of printing as regards spelling , punctuation , and so forth , corrected errors in dates , names , quotations , foreign terms , and the like , and , in a word , established a text such as any author desires of his own works . This was , in feet , a critical edition There is another way of editing the sources , namely , to reproduce them in their original state This the Virginia editors have adopted . They have retained the contemporary form in which Poe 's writings appeared , in all the details of the printing , and have corrected errors only in the most necessary cases , and then with notice to the reader It is a facsimile method of editing . Either method has advantages of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors , but , in general , the former is the best for the general public ; the latter is the most useful to the special literary student . With this general statement as to the character of the editing , and with the remark that the arrangement is chronological , by divisions , the results may best be illustrated by taking the parts separately , and examining them with regard to the three prime virtues of editing ? fulness , accuracy , and authority . In the " Tales " and " Poems " there is no new matter , and the verbal text does not differ in any material point from that generally received , such variations as there are being in the nature of very minor corrections . The original sources , printed and manuscript , are the same used by other editors , except that the first publication of " The Angel of the Odd " in the Columbian Magazine has been found and collated . The identification had been previously made by the late W. M. Griswold Further research by the editors might not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " The Sphinx , " for the text of which Griswold has been the only authority , was in Arthur 's Magazine , January , 1846 , and an earlier text of " Mystification " than any collated may be found in the American Mouthly for June , 1837 . The novel feature of the edition , under " Tales " and " Poems , " is a variorum , showing the state of the text in the different forms published by Poe . As is well known , Poe was accustomed to revise his work of all sorts , and print it over again whenever he had a chance The extent of this revision is remarkable , and the illustration now afforded of it by this laborious compilation is complete for this section Woodberry had already done the same thing for the " Poems , " but the extension of this method to the " Tales " is the most peculiar and valuable trait of the Virginia edition To confine attention to the " Poems , " " The Raven " may be regarded as a fair example by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raven " was issued by Poe in the American Whig Review , corrected in the Broadway Journal , and revised in the edition of ' 1845 , it now is given either in a fourth form , that of Griswold , or a fifth , that of the Lorimer-Graham copy ( originally Griswold 's ) of the 1845 edition , with MS. corrections by Poe . There are thus five distinct forms of the poem If the variorum of the Virginia editors be compared with these , the following results appear In , the account of the first form , two readings , mortals and something , are recorded , but do not occur , in that of the second , the same readings are recorded , but do not occur , a variant in stanza xi , 5 is omitted , and a misprint vied for tried , should be noted ; there is no account of the third form , there is no account of the fourth form , except a reference made to it in the account of the first , and the reference is incorrect ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The editors give , however , an account of the form in the Southern Literary Messenger , which is verbally the same as that in the Whig Review , but differs in punctuation . In describing this , they omit six readings , give in stanza xi . the Broadway Journal reading by mistake , and in stanza ii , 2 ( as also in the Broadway Journal form in the same place ) adduce a variation where none exists . The raven is an ill-omened bird , and makes here a pretty nest of errors It is not given to editors to be faultless , and this is a peculiarly trying kind of work ; the rest of the editing is , on the whole , much more to be trusted , so far as we have examined it A few other errors may be noted in passing , in case the work should be revised , as it needs to be in " Al Aaraaf , " 1831 , lines 26-30 , are omitted ; in " Israfel , " 1831 , viii 4 , so for as ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , 1836 , the omission of six lines from 1831 is not noted The date of " To One in Paradise , " in Godey 's , should be 1834 . Misprints are numerous throughout the notes , one in the body of the text , " The Valley of Unrest , " line 22 , three for titers , may be worth correction Apart from these matters of detail , we observe that the variant readings of the Philadelphia papers are entirely omitted , as well as those of the Wilmer manuscript and of the manuscript facsimile of the lines to Mrs Shew . To pass to the critical writings , it is hers that the editors are most proud of what they have accomplished , and if enthusiasm for their author and laborious patience in his service were all there is to editing , they might well be satisfied They have greatly increased the bulk of the section , partly by including reviews hitherto thought too valueless to be revived , and partly by printing the earlier forms of later critical writing in addition to the latter The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the " Tales " and " Poems , " only , instead of giving the variants in notes , the original articles are reprinted It is better that there should be repetition , it is said in explanation , than that anything of Poe 's should be lost . The results are occasionally surprising , owing to Poe 's inveterate habit of using his old material over again . For example , a long review of Hall 's ' Book of Gems , ' from the Southern Literary Messenger , ' August , 1836 , was reprinted , very slightly revised , in the Broadway Journal 1845 ; the editors , therefore , give it twice  --  once in volume ix 91 as " early criticism , " and again in volume xii 139 as " later criticism . " Some passages will be thus found In at least three places . In these ways the amount of critical matter is enlarged by the reprinting of earlier forms of papers which have hitherto been taken only in their final forms , and by reviving a considerable portion of transitory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section " Marginalia " is much swelled in this way In respect to fulness , nevertheless , nothing previously unknown has been found , nor is all that is known included . The critical section , however , raises a much more important question than that of completeness  --  the question of the authority of Griswold 's text in those portions where it differs from the magazine publication by Poe in his lifetime . The Virginia editors challenge it , and assail Griswold 's character after the old manner of Poe 's apologists The subject is brought to a head in the text of the ' Literati , ' In the " Editor 's Preface " the chief editor says , without qualification : " Of the original thirty-eight papers printed by Poe , five found in the current editions are Griswold 's substitutes for Poe 's original articles . We have rejected the spurious papers and put Poe 's back in theirplaces . " The italics are his own . In the special " Introduction " to the ' Literati , ' he adds : ' " The Literati of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed under its own title , just as Poe wrote it , was ' edited ' by Griswold , who substituted for Poe 's papers on Thomas Dunn English , Mary E. Hewitt , James Lawson , C. F. Briggs and Mrs. F. S. Osgood , other papers in the Poe manner . These Griswold versions will be found in the Appendix . " The charge is grave , and should not have been lightly made . It is that Griswold , being Poe 's literary executor , tampered with the text , and " substituted , " in fact , " spurious " papers " in the Poe manner " for Poe 's own articles in these five cases , and elsewhere the position taken is that Griswold , unsupported by an independent text , is untrustworthy . Let us take the case of the paper on Mrs. F. S. Osgood . Griswold 's text is printed in the Appendix ( vol. xv , 271 ) . If the reader will turn to volume xiii , 175 , under the head of " Later Criticism , " he will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his life in the Southern Literary Messenger for August , 1849 , and hence here included It is identical with Griswold 's paper , except for some slight variation in the extent of the quotations from Mrs. Osgood 's poems , and also for the omission of some five lines at the end . In other words , the paper on Mrs. Osgood , described as " spurious , " and written " in the Poe manner , " is also printed as Poe 's undoubted work . It is hardly credible that so stupid a blunder should have been made , especially when the editor was attacking the character of one of his predecessors ; but there the two articles stare the reader in the face . " We have carefully disentangled what might well be called the snarl of the ' Literati , ' " says the editor , and this is the way he began to do it What is " the snarl of the ' Literati ' " ? The truth about it is as follows : Poe contributed a series of papers , with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later time he formed a plan of gathering his critical writings on American authors into a book , and , as usual , he rewrote and rearranged the whole , using his old material . The work was advertised to appear in the spring of 1847 , but it was never published . The manuscript of this work , with some parts missing , was found among the Griswold papers . The way in which Poe used it may be readily illustrated . The present writer has before him pp. 79 , 80 of the MS. which contain a revised version of the paper on Laughton Osborn in the ' Literati . ' Poe used a portion of this to make his introduction to his review of Lowell 's " Fable for Critics " in the Southern Literary Messenger for March , 1849 . The rest has never been printed . In the last-mentioned magazine for October , 1850 , appeared " Poe on Headley and Charming , " announced as " from advance sheets of ' The Literati , ' a work in press by the late Edgar ? A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , namely , a revised ' Literati , ' is clear ; and from its pages Poe 's later critical magazine writings were extracted . He was merely following his usual method when he sent the paper on Mrs. Osgood to the Messenger in 1849 . From this same source , there can be no doubt Griswold obtained the half-dozen critical papers not previously published , as well as the four other " substituted " papers of the ' Literati , ' and also the rearrangement of the papers on Hawthorne and other writers at which the Virginia editors are so indignant . " Griswold , " Professor Harrison says , " has taken the review of Hawthorne in Godey 's Lady 's Book for November , 1847 , split it open , inserted another review of Hawthorne from Graham 's Magame for May , 1842 , mutilated the latter , and then continued with the tail fragment of the 1847 review as colophon , thus dissecting Poe 's later paper on the New England writer , and inserting scraps in fragments from one written five years earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own work . Griswold would not have taken the trouble to do it . There is no ground to question for a moment that Griswold had manuscript authority for whatever he published differing from or in addition to Poe 's printed texts . Even in the case of " The Raven " it must be held an open question whether his version or the Lorimer-Graham version , which he also owned , is of the higher authority . As to the ' Literati , ' Griswold was in possession of a manuscript , more or less complete , in part a revision of old work , in part a first copy of MS. elsewhere used in other connections , and , in general , crossing Poe 's published work in various ways . It is to be inferred that he used this manuscript , as was said above , for the final form for such papers as those on Hawthorne , and a revised form for the five ' Literati papers , and the only source for a few pieces ; and that he did not utilize it in cases where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetition of passages elsewhere appearing . The truth is , that the editor 's prejudice against Griswold has led him to reject Poe 's own late and mature revision of his major critical writings in favor of these early , scattered , and fragmentary forms in which they appeared in the magazines in their original helter-skelter production . The same question , it should be observed , arose , though less importantly , in the " Tales . " There the editor " straddled " ; for example , Griswold 's revision of " The Cask of Amontillado " is rejected , " as we have no positive evidence that these changes were made by Poe " , his " Hans Pfaall " and " Metzengerstein " are accepted , " as undoubtedly founded on a revised form of tho text in the hands of the editor " ; and his " Thousand and Second Tale " is also accepted , but without reason assigned . In conclusion , it must be held that Griswold 's authority , so far from being impaired , is strengthened by the present attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that proportion in which it departs from him in substance . In any discussion of the text of Poe the primary fact should never be lost sight of , namely , that Griswold had Poe 's papers , as collected and prepared by Poe himself , who expected that he might die at any time and had taken care to ask Griswold to be his executor . Griswold 's task was comparatively a light one ; he hid no motive to tamper with the text , and beyond the fact that he did not go much outside the collections he had received , and did not oversee the printing with great accuracy , there is no fault to be found with him . We have left ourselves with short space for the remainder of the contents of the edition , i e. , the Letters and the Biography The idea of collecting the letters was an admirable one , for , taken together , they give , with all their triviality of subject and frequent meanness of spirit , the best personal impression of Poe . The collection is very complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , the letter to Bryan , published April 16 , 1892 , in the Critic . The editor makes much of including the Griswold papers which were copied for him from the originals at Boston , or procured in other ways We observe that he does not mention the publication of all the important letters to , from , or about Poe , in this collection , by Woodberry some years ago . The same lack of candor is even more noticeable in the fact that , while he has obtained several of the letters first collected in Woodberry 's ' Life of Poe ' from the original sources and owners , and has paraphrased such others in it as he could not so obtain , including those to Lowell , he does not mention that biography as the source . In his own biography of Poe there is very little that is new , and that little is discreditable to Poe . He revives the Richmond gossip about Poe 's demanding money of a lady of the Allan family and smashing the windows of the house on being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of Mr Allan 's rupture with Poe as being the latter 's forgery of the former 's name , though the fact has been strongly suspected . His authority is a niece of Mr Allan , from whom he prints a letter . There is no attempt in the biography to conceal Poe 's faults . Indeed , there has been no such collection of the evidence against Poe as is here gathered . The whole of the English episode , for example , is included , and the damaging letter of his friend Thompson ? " no confidence could be placed m him in any relation of life " ? with many others , revive nearly all the scandal connected with his name . It would hardly have been possible for any one except a professed Southern apologist of Poe to do this without offence ; as it is , an unmeasured eulogy of Poe ( these things excepted ) makes the balance even . A few incidental blemishes are to be regretted in this part of the work . The sneer at Longfellow 's veracity might well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unpleasant one , while such things as the charge of lying brought against Briggs are , perhaps , though groundless , to be expected , since the apologists of Poe have always shown an incapacity to appreciate the fact that the character of others beside Poe is at stake in their statements Altogether , the biography is a very curious mixture of derogatory facts and laudatory remarks The other critical apparatus of the edition is of very slight value . On the whole , notwithstanding its shortcomings and errors , its minimizing , obscuring , and undervaluing the labors of others in the same field , and especially its wrong-headed attitude toward Griswold , for which it pays so heavy a penalty in lessening its own authority , the edition is to be heartily welcomed . it gathers together much obscure matter for the student of Poe , and collects in an accessible form much that has hitherto been scattered in many places , and it will range with other editions , not swallowing them up like Aaron 's rod , but reposing amicably beside them on library shelves .
