txt Charles E. Hughes , who was counsel for the Gas Investigating Committee , and Senator Alfred R. Page , a member of the committee and father of the Eighty-Cent Gas bill , the provisions of which the Consolidated Gas Company is now seeking to nullify in the Federal courts , have been chosen by Attorney General Mayer to assist him in the preparation of the cese for the people . They will aid him when the argument to make permanent the in-. junction restraining the State officers from putting into effect the provisions of the eighty-cent gas law is made before Judge Lacombe on June 4 . Late yesterday afternoon Judge Lacombe settled the terms of the prelimea nary order in his chambers in the pres- I ence of the Attorney General and counsel for the gas company . It restrains the ' Attorney General , the District Attorney , and the members of the State Gas Commission from putting the State law into effect and from enforcing any of the penalties provided in it until the time of the decision on the motion now pending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600,000 customers at the old dollar rate if they are willing to pay it , but the company must pay to Commissioner Shields , the Clerk of the Court , all amounts collected in excess of the eightycent rate from May 1 . Within six days of the end of the month the company must give to the Clerk a sworn statement of the amounts collected and the excess over the eighty-cent rate . This is to be deposited in the Citizens ' Central National Bank , where it will draw 2 per cent . interest . That will be apportioned among the payers if the law is declared to be good . The years that the money of 600,000 gas users may be tied up in the courts should Judge Lacombe grant the permanent injunction pending the trial of the action and its final decision may be judged from the case on which Judge Lacombe 's decision is based . This is Regan vs. the Farmers ' Loan and Trust Company . It was more than three years from the time the first order was made until the case was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the case the Farmers ' Loan and Trust Company , as trustee for bondholders in a Texas railway , which brought suit to restrain John W. Regan and others , State Railway Commissioners , from putting certain rates into effect , the charge was that they confiscated the property of the bondholders end the company . A permanent injunction was grented , and the case dragged through the courts for years before being won by Regan and his associates . Serious Legal Mlx6Up . It became evident yesterday that some of the most serious legal complications ever known in this jurisdiction are likely to arise over the willingness of the gas consumers to pay the dollar rate . It is clearly pointed out by the highest authority that the restraining order of Judge Lacombe can not bind any but a party to the action , and thus leaves free to every gas consumer the right to exercise his individual will . The court directs the company to collect the dollar rate , but it can not compel the consumer to pay it , and here the first great complication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after May 1 and the company refuses to take it , the latter has two methods of procedure . It can bring a suit in every instance to compel the consumer to pay the dollar rate , and should there be united action on the part of the company might soon have many thousands of suits on its hands . The company can also proceed by taking out the metre , but Judge Lacombe 's ' I order does not take from any citizen his right to go to the court of his State and get an injunction against the company to restrain it ' from depriving the litigant ' of gas . Such an action would be brought and carried through en-1 tirely independent of any action in the Circuit Court of the ' United States . The gas company intends to pay into court , so its counsel says , an amount equal to 20 per cent . of the May collections of last year , and here again a difficulty will arise that may be made the basis of many complicated suits . The gas company sends out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They run for thirty-day periods . The company , not having taken the state of every one of its meters on May 1 . so as accurately to determine what the 20 per cent . overcharge will be , will have to approximate the amount it will turn in to the Court Clerk . Associations to Fight . One of the probable outcomes of this court decision , especially if the injunction be made permanent on June 4 , will be the formation of a number of associations of gas consumers to take concerted action and to stand up for what they deem their rights under a test of their status in the State courts . It was also pointed out on authority that the Circuit Court had placed upon itself a burden by this decision that it can work out only for itself . About 000,000 will be paid into court every month while the injunction continues . For this Commissioner Shields is responsible , and he will remain responsible until the final adjudication of the case . If the case is dragged out over several years this may amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for this vast amount the court clerk will have only the affidavits of the company 's officers that the amounts turned over to him are correct . He has no force of clerks that can prove the accounts , and should he demand sufficient protection from the courts in the handling of these vast sums the Government may be saddled with an expense equal to that of running the clerical force of the gas company , for it is pointed out that it would take as many clerks under Mr. Shields to prove the accounts as it took to make out the original bills in the gas company 's office . Mr. Shields , the attorneys for the State , // GAS COMPANY FACES MANY HARD FIGHTS // and the gas company could not give any answer yesterday to questions affecting the handling of there funds if a permanent injunction should be issued on June 4 . They said they were willing only to say that the court . having brought it all about , would make proper provision to see that its decrees were properly carried into effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing the consumers to pay the dollar rate , 20 per cent . of It will be tied up where the consumers ? if they are the rightful owners  --  can not use It . It will yield them only 2 per cent . a year at the best . Many merchants and householders will of course be dissatisfied with such a return on their money , If it proves to be theirs . The Consolidated Gas Company officials refused to make any statement yesterdeA4 other than to express satisfaction at ? Tie state of affairs . President Gawtry is in Europe , and the attorneys were busy preparing their cases . A man close to the company said , however , that the company would not do anything to add to the difficulties of the case . He said he did not believe that the gas would be shut off except in . ' xtreme cases , and then pointed out that to a certain extent the company had protection from the deposits placed in its hands by the gas consumers . All this , he said , might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was also alleged yesterday that the gas company , if it loses the suit . will , if it can engineer matters in its own way , deduct the extra 20 per cent . from future bills inStead of returning it In ca.lh to the consumers . It intends to do that anyway if the order is not made permanent on June 4 , but Commissioner Shields may have something to say about that as custodian of the money paid into court . Mayer , Hughes , and Page . Attorney General Mayer refused to make any statement on the case yesterday . He and his associates will matte a hard fight to have the temporhry restraining order dissolved at the next hearing . The Attorney General denied yesterday that he had in any way agreed to the order as made by Judge Lacombe . The record of the court shows that he appeared in opposition to the motion by Mr. Choate , and that his opposition was continued until the order was signed in the private chambers of the Judge yesterday . In its bill of complaint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constitution of tha United States , in that it seeks to deprive the plaintiff of its property without due process of law and compensation .
