 |p1183  training of the samurai and his worship for the sword and aspirations for fame reads as an Oriental version of the Spartan history . Athens flowered upon the isles of the Pacific in the culture of Nara , of Kyoto and of the Yedo of the Genroku period . In the matter of religion ? the expression of the deepest phase of human life ? both on the Mediterranean and upon the Pacific , the forces of nature were apotheosized ; the Greek called it mythology ; we call it Shintoism . These analogies are striking . More striking even than these , however , is the similarity in the troublous matter of taste . Simplicity and the appreciation of the proportion of things , men and events , are the distinguishing hall mark of Hellenic culture . Higher than that has the esthetic ideal of Nippon never climbed . Let us take it up on elementary lines , this question of the canon of taste ? food . Plain living and high thinking , said your Concord sage , following Wordsworth . And the reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that is chiefly because there seems to be little occasion to call it forth . You have heard much of the simple diet of the Nippon people and how , in the present trouble in Manchuria , the excellent showing of our soldiers ' health is largely due to that fact . It is not a national habit of the people of Nippon born of a modern day ; neither is it confined to the men of modest means . Years ago , in the golden days of samurai and castles , simplicity in diet reigned over the banquet halls of the princes with a much more despotic scepter than it does in the civilized toclay . With the rich , above the necessaries of life the simple rigor of his table was a question of art-conscience , a matter of taste ; it was the stamp of refinement . It was not economy alone that was aimed at in those elegant feasts ; apparently simple , the banquets of those rigorous days cost much more than those which might have been styled sumptuous . It is true , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich dishes were offered ; but the rich courses and costly sake , if used at all , were nothing but a means to an end . They were the setting by which the excellences of the elegance of the simple might be brought out with the advantage of contrast . In the castle town of my forefathers there lived a man of taste . He was of the princely line of Matsudaira , lords of the historic castle of Mitsuhide . In honor of the autumn moon he asked on a day of happy omen a few men and women to join him in the Hall of Kiri ( Paulownia imperialis ) . They were men and women first of all , and then too they were men and women of culture , of letters , of taste , and , singularly enough , all indifferent to wealth . Classical couplets flowed with the choice sake in the silver light of the cloudless night ; our Lord Matsudaira was a master of imagination and of literary grace . On this occasion every dish that was served to his friends was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful to the eye than tempting to the palate . As the ripened full moon hung on a far gone hour of night and upon the arm of the pine sleeved with the frosted dusk , and the feast was also ripening to its close , and his guests were marveling at the richness of the feast and the sake , our lord of the clan lifted up a cup in his hand and faced his guests . Silence fell upon the Hall of Kiri . The cup in the lifted hand of the Prince was filled with pure water . " Permit me to offer you , by way of crowning the humble refreshment , a cup which is not unworthy for the lips of the gods . For I have reserved to the last this , the choicest offering ; I hope you will forgive me for imposing common sake upon your good nature . I know after so much common sake , the virtues of this cup which I am about to beg you to partake , will be the more keenly appreciated by you . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Kyoto ( and the culture , especially in taste , of the ancient capital of the Mikado is as old as the mosses upon its temple yards ) there lived a man whose name was Isono ; he was famous as a man of taste . When my childhood days were graced by the acquaintance of him ? he was fond of children ? he was a man of over sixtyfive . A man of wealth and of rank , he had devoted himself without reserve to the appreciation and creation of the beautiful in flowers and in letters . In letters he was partial to that choice form of belles-lettres called hokku or haikai ,  |p1184  which demands of an artist in letters to give to the world in seventeen syllables ? syllables , not words , pray mark ? a poetic thought , a fairy world , a finished and polished expression of wisdom ; or a glimpse of a deep philosophy , or sometimes even a peep into the world unknown or a spark such as would kindle the heart of a nation , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cultivation and perfection of a certain type of chrysanthemums also he had given over twenty years of his life . All his life he had never allowed silk to adorn the outside of his garment . One day a Bohemian friend of his , who was famous for his abnormal weakness for levity , spied a twinkle of silk peeping out from under his cotton kimono . " Ah , silken garments , Mr. Isono , " said the Bohemian , delighted . " The old age is a mischief of a thing , " the old gentleman apologized , " my shoulders find comfort in the light weight of silk . When you think of it a little you can hardly blame them , they have borne the snow-weight of over sixty winters , and that is a good deal for a pair of common mortal shoulders . I am using silk for the lining of my kimono . " Now Kyoto is famous as the home of a gold brocade called the Nishijin weave , which has belted the world with the praise of the Japanese textile industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to task : " You are a native and citizen of the city of Kyoto ; you are very hard upon Nishijin-ori , which is one of the glories of her industry . " " I am not such a solemn foe of the Nishijin brocade as you seem to take me . It is a good thing to amuse children . The good people who have never seen anything better , I notice , are always delighted with it . I am always happy when others are pleased . Only . I notice that the rise of the Nishijin industry marked the fall of the Tokugawa power ; it might be a mere historical coincidence . " To the eyes of America and Europe the interior of our houses is bare . It is not because we have no decorative art , because if the art world of Europe could be taken as an authority on this point we in Nippon have the finest development of that very phase of art . And it is far from being bare , if you but look about a little . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is likely to be admitted you can always find an alcove called tokonoma . Upon a low platform of the tokonoma it is usual to find a vase , in it a flower arrangement . You may also see a kakemono , which is of paper or silk and in shape a long , narrow panel , and which is suspended by cords upon the wall . Upon the kakemono you might find a study in black and white by Buncho , Sesson , Korin , or a water color by Okio or Goshun . Instead of pictures , and quite often , too , one finds a few lines of chirography ; a classic couplet , perhaps , or a Chinese poem or a text from an ancient sage ? but all traced with that vigor and with that eloquence that tell of the character of the penman and appeal to the imagination of the beholder and which make brush-writing one of the branches of fine art in the Far East . This bareness of our rooms is not without reason . In the first place , our rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second-hand curio shop . In the second place , our faith in the ability of quantity and number making good what quality lacks is rather weak . Moreover , and this is the third reason , we are abject slaves and our task master is called the beautiful ; her thraldom , let me assure the innocent , is not a whit lightened because the chains with which she binds her slaves are of art . Our reverence for a work of art is a superstition ? foolish , mad , past all the understanding of the wise West . Like love ? and most assuredly our passion for the beautiful is infinitely more serious than the appetites of the flesh ? it is a jealous divinity that we serve . It gives us much and all sorts of trouble . And one of them is this : If a work of art is worth our respect at all it commands our undivided worship at least for a time . It is not permitted us , therefore , to serve two gods at one and the same time . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one kakemono upon the wall of the tokonoma . And the fourth reason , which some consider even more important than the third , is much simpler than the others ; and for that very reason , no doubt , it seems to
