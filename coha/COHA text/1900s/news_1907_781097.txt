The new buildings are of brick , each three stories high , the lower floors being devoted to stores and the upper stories divided into tenements only .

According to Morris Maier , owner of the grocery , who resided with his family directly above his place of business , the houses had been finished recently and an employe of the gas company had called during the day to install the gas meters preparatory to the occupation of the tenements . The man , ace trains to Maier , Said he had another job to do before dark and hurried away . Shortly afterward Maier noticed that there was a strong smell of gas , and , guessing that the pipes were leaking badly as a result of the installation of the meters , he sent his son after the gasfitter . While the boy was absent the explosion occurred . The detonation was terrific and was plainly heard four miles away . Men and women who were in the stores at the time were thrown against the front walls and in some cases out upon the sidewalk . A deluge of bricks , wood , and glass rained down on the street . Every window in the block of houses was shattered and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were torn out of the walls and blown into the street smashed to bits .

The explosion threw the whole neighborhood into a panic . Men and women rushed pell mell from their homes , and the children who were not injured ran screaming down the street . The house at No. 401 , an old structure . was of the tenement variety and occupied by a number of Jewish families . The Panic in this house when the explosion occurred nearly resulted seriously . The men and women In the house started at once for the narrow stairway . In the lower hall they met others of the occupants who were seeking to get into the house to save their cLlldren or their belongings , believing that there would be a fire and the whole block would be destroyed .

As soon as Police Captain Cullen of the Sixty-third Precinct arrived he sent in hurry calls for ambulances to the Bushwick and Bradford Street Hospitals .

So great had been the force of the ex ? plosion that practically the whole rear wall of 403 had been blown away , together with both side walls and a corner of the rear portion of 405 , all to the full height of the buildings . That the force of the explosion had been outward and not either upward or downward , was shown conclusively by the fact that the floors and roof of 403 were practically intact , though tottering , with no . walls to sup-port them save those in the front part of the building . Mater assured the police that no light had been carried into the rear portion of his place , and the same assertion was made by the members Of the Lerners family , who own the candy store next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position at which the explosion occurred , and the police advanced the theory that the pressure of gas had been increased at nightfall by the tirooklyn Union Gas Company , which supplies the premises , and that the preesurebeceme too great for the joinings made during the day by the gasfitter .
