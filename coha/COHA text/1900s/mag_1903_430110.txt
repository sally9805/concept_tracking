 | TO the State of Indiana belongs the credit of striking out on certain lines of taxation which mark the progress of tax reform during the past ten years . The legislation of 1891 in that State developed both new machinery and new principles of taxation which , being sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States , have served as guides for other States . Both by what Indiana accomplished and by what she showed can not be accomplished , has the progress of reform in State and local taxation been advanced . IMPROVEMENTS ON THE LOCAL ASSESSMENT SYSTEM . The new machinery of taxation introduced in 1891 was the State Board of Tax Commissioners and the county assessors . The glaring evil which that machinery corrected was the unchecked authority of township and ward assessors . The local assessor is elected by his fellow-citizens . His valuation of their property determines the share which each shall pay toward local taxes , and the share which all shall pay toward county and State taxes . He is paid $2 a day , and works two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callings are most attractive . Both by their local patriotism in protecting their constituents from county and State taxes , and by their incapacity for earning anything more than the wages of farm hands in the spring time , the 1,300 local assessors of Indiana , like the similar thousands in other States , had shaved down the valuations , or failed to note the existence , of millions of dollars ' worth of local property . The American jealousy of centralization was augmented by a pecuniary motive , which made the local assessor especially dear to the immemorial precepts of local selfgovernment . Indiana went as far toward the invasion of these precepts as the state of public mind and an intolerable situation of tax evasion would then permit , but not as far as other States which have followed her lead . She created first the appointive office of county assessor . This official supervises the town assessors , and even takes the assessment out of their hands whenever he is convinced of their incapacity or inequity . His power , however , is guarded , since his action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of review which appoints him . This board decides between him and the local assessor . The taxpayer , also , as heretofore , has an appeal to the board . THE INDIANA COMMISSION AND ITS POWERS . The State Tax Commission is the regulator of the entire machinery of assessment . It is ingeniously constructed so as to subserve economy of salaries and balance of interests . Two appointed members on modest salaries give their entire time to the work , and three ex-officio members , the governor , secretary of state , and auditor of state , meet with them for four or five weeks at the close of the assessment season . The secretary of the commission is the deputy auditor of state . No assessment is complete or valid in any part of the State until approved by this high administrative court , which entertains appeals made by taxpayers , by assessors , or by county boards of review . The commission raises or lowers the assessments of individuals , or of entire towns , cities , or counties . It finally approves the grand duplicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread upon the books of the tax collectors . CONFERENCES OF COUNTY AND LOCAL ASSESSORS . The appointive members of this commission visit every county in the State and examine the work of assessment . They deal directly with the county assessors . Every year , just before the annual assessment , the State Board assembles all of the county assessors at Indianapolis for a conference . Here they agree upon uniform rules of valuation for every item of property throughout the State , from chickens to banks . Although these rules are not binding in law , they serve as guides to the several assessors , and have undoubtedly tended toward uniformity . After the State conference , the county assessors return to their separate fields and hold similar conferences with the local assessors . In this way a continuous equalization is in progress , and the State commissioners keep their hands on the entire taxation machinery of the State . THE " UNIT RULE " AS APPLIED TO CORPORATIONS . It is in the assessment of railroads and interstate carriers that the Indiana system has made the distinctive advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These properties had never been assessed at their full value , owing to conflicts with interstate commerce , and owing to  | the separate assessment by 1,300 local assessors . The law of 1891 gave the State Commission original jurisdiction in the assessment of these properties , except for real estate . It gave the commission power to determine the value of an entire railway system running through several States , and then to apportion to Indiana and to the several towns and cities such proportion of this aggregate value as the local mileage bears to the aggregate mileage . Most important of all , the law did not prescribe any rules of valua ? tion , but left this to the good judgment of the board , and the Supreme Court of the United States has sustained the board in its great powers and the finality of its appraisals . Out of these decisions , and others on the same line , the Supreme Court has developed the so-called " unit rule " of assessment , by which interstate corporations may be valued as a unit , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale it is worth for taxation . " Without specifying the taxation of franchises , this unit rule , which relies mainly on the device of adding together the market value of the stocks and bonds , or of capitalizing the net income , plainly taxes the franchise and good-will as well as the tangible property of the corporation . In the first year of its organization the Indiana board raised the assessed valuation of the railroads within the State from $69,000,000 to $160,000,000 . In 1893 , the Legislature extended the original jurisdiction of the State Board to express companies and telegraph and telephone companies , and in 1901 to fast freight and sleeping-car companies , and to pipe lines traversing more than one county . THE MICHIGAN SYSTEM - ENLARGED POWERS OF THE STATE COMMISSION . The State of Michigan , in 1899 , improved upon the Indiana system in some particulars , but fell short in others . Thinking that Indiana had raised up a superfluous officer in the county assessor , the Michigan Legislature omitted this important wheel in the machine , but gave the State Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably a mistake , since it compels the State Commission to deal directly with 1,400 local assessors instead of 80 county assessors . But the State Commission has powers so much greater than those of the Indiana Commission that there is a certain compensation . It has power to change any assessment within the State upon its own motion , and without waiting for an appeal . It can summon any individual or corporation to a special review , or it can summon an entire township or city to a general review , to show cause why his or its assessment should not be raised . The newspaper announcements of these reviews , citing by name hundreds of taxpayers to appear at the city hall , the court house , or the hotel , have become a common feature of the stirring methods of this commission . Valuations throughout the State have been literally " jerked up , " ? to use the only term that fitly describes the ensuing state of mind . True , these hoistings have not increased the tax burden as a whole , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fixed " mill rate . " With this exception , the commission has merely redistributed the burden , and a lower tax rate has followed the higher valuation . The copper mines , for example , were raised from $28,000 , - 000 to $108,000,000 , whereas the average rise of all property was only some 40 or 50 per cent . RAILROAD TAXES COLLECTED BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT . The Michigan Commission differs from that of Indiana in its personnel . It is composed solely of appointive members , ? at first three , then increased to five , and these are kept busy going to and fro in the State . In this respect the Indiana system is superior , since the presence of elective members , including the highest officers of the State , gives dignity and responsibility , while the appointive members furnish technical and expert qualities . This balance of the two methods of selection , like the bimetallic theory of money , maintains a more stable immunity from that corporate or political pressure which is certain at times to influence one or both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both methods at the same time . The Michigan Commission , unlike the Indiana Commission , has a large staff of clerks , and , more essential than clerks , a civil engineer and accountant for the valuation of corporate properties . Here again the Indiana model is followed , in that railroads and other carriers are assessed directly by the State Board by the unit rule . But , differently from Indiana , the taxes are computed at the average tax rate of the State , and are collected as a unit by the state treasurer , instead of being apportioned to the counties according to mileage , and collected by the ninety county treasurers . The revenues thus secured are distributed to the school districts according to school attendance . The Michigan Commission has recently made its first assessment of railroads , and has placed their assessed value at $208,212.500 . The tax on this amount , at the average rate of 1.3689 per cent . for the State , will amount to $2,850 , - 231 , a sum almost double the taxes paid in 1901 , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MONTHL  | The gain to the school fund may be realized when it is known that already there are some localities in the State where it has been found unnecessary to raise any local taxes for school purposes , owing to the funds already received from the State railroad tax OHIO 'S ATTEMPTS TO TAX PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATIONS . Indiana and Michigan are furnishing lessons to other States . In Ohio the investigations of Prof. B. W. Bemis showed that railroads were assessed at one-third to one-half of the assessed value per mile of the same roads in the two adjoining States . Under the Ohio decisions , however , neither railroads nor municipal public service corporations can be assessed upon their franchise values , but the assessment is restricted to the value of tangible property . Growing out of the interest aroused in this situation , the Legislature , in 1902 , enacted two laws , the " Willis Law , " imposing an " excise tax " of one-tenth of one per cent . on the capital stock of domestic and foreign corporations employed within the State , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax " of 1 per cent . on the gross revenues of public service corporations . Under the Willis law the tax is paid to the secretary of state " for the privilege of exercising its franchises in Ohio . " Under the Cole law the tax is computed by an ea- , officio board of appraisers , including the state auditor , state treasurer , attorney-general , and secretary of state . Both taxes are paid to the State treasury . The tangible property of railroads continues to be assessed by the county auditors of the counties through which the roads run . EFFORTS AT TAX REFORM IN WISCONSIN AND MINNESOTA . The Indiana and Michigan systems have been investigated by official commissions from Wisconsin and Minnesota , and certain features have been recommended and adopted in those States . Wisconsin has a tax commission of three members , appointed for ten years , for the express purpose of investigation and recommendation , and has adopted the Indiana idea of county assessors . A Minnesota commission recommended a tax code modeled closely after that of Indiana , but the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because it was defective as a piece of machinery , but because it promised to be too effective in exposing omitted intangible property . DIFFICULTIES IN ASSESSING BANK DEPOSITS . This brings me to the objects which recent tax reforms show can not be accomplished . One of the first things which the Indiana Commission set itself to do was the discovery of intangible property , and it began with bank deposits . Deposits in Indiana are treated as cash , and , unlike other credits , can not be offset by debts . Bank reports showed more than one hundred millions on deposit , and scarcely a million had ever been assessed . Here was a rich field in which to vindicate the new law . Encouraged by its unprecedented powers , extending even to imprisonment for contempt , the commission summoned bankers to open their books , and , on their refusal , condemned them to jail . Habeas corpus proceedings immediately brought the matter to court . The lawyers of the State were unprepared , for no important tax litigation had come to them for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , on appeal , the Supreme Court of the State declared that penalties and imprisonment were judicial prerogatives , and the Legislature had exceeded its powers in bestowing such grants upon an administrative branch . At the next assessment , on April 1 , the bankers claimed that many millions of deposits were withdrawn from the banks , and many of them transferred to banks of other States , and , with this argument , finally , in 1901 , they secured a substitute to this section of the law greatly restricting the inquisitorial powers of local assessors . This chapter from the Indiana experiment marks off at least one road which tax reform can not follow . Indeed , it shows that the more perfect the machinery of the assessment , the more vicious the effect of bad laws . A bank panic on April 1 every year might well indicate that the law which provoked it was not merely dangerous to tax-dodgers , but also unsound in economics . If banks are taxed on the full value of their capital , and the banking business is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate or no rate of interest on deposits which the banks can afford to pay . THE QIEST1ON OF TAXING MORTGAGES . Another lesson in tax reform is on the taxation of mortgages . Here Michigan and Wisconsin have been more spectacular , but not more instructive , than Indiana . Indiana approached the subject gradually and gave the tax-dodgers notice . Michigan and Wisconsin came down suddenly and hard , and the adjustment is not yet complete . The Michigan State Commission secures from every recorder of deeds in the State a list of all unsatisfied mortgages held by residents of the State , with the address of the mortgagee . These are classified at headquarters and sent out to every assessor .  | In Indiana and Wisconsin the county assessors exchange their lists directly . In one year in Michigan the total assessment of mortgages was raised from some $5,000,000 to $55,000,000 . Wisconsin in four years raised the assessment of intangible property from about $16,000,000 to $72,000,000 , nearly all of the increase being in mortgages . Other classes of credits escape because they are not of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mortgages are renewed or new ones made at an advance of 1 per cent . or 1 per cent . in the rate of interest . This has aroused the farmers to a lively interest in the economics of tax laws , following their earlier interest in the reform of tax administration . But the adjustment is taking place , and ' in Indiana it is already made , with interest on average mortgage security at 5 per cent. , against q. per cent . and 7 per cent . in the other States . HOW LENDERS DODGE THE MORTGAGE TAX . The devices for adjustment are diverse and ingenious . The inquirer hears of a new one nearly every day . A college professor naively relates that he sends his money to his sister in New York , who sends it back for him to lend on mortgage at 5 per cent . Others less conscientious create fictitious friends or relatives in other States , whose money they loan . Mortgages are made out to " trustees " and assigned without record . A presiding elder lends his money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these private lenders are at a disadvantage . State banks and trust companies , being assessed on their capital , are not assessed directly on their mortgages . And when they have reached their limit of investments in longtime loans , many of them accommodate their customers by assigning to them mortgages held in their own name . Most of all , foreign insurance companies and other lenders come into the State , and it is these lenders in Indiana that have established the rate at 5 per cent . They probably will do the same in the other States . Here again is a road which tax reform can not take . Improved machinery of assessment throws the mortgage tax on the borrower , or else gives a bonus to untaxed holders and outside holders , and this forces the unprivileged holder to prevaricate . Yet , naturally enough , the prevaricator does not consider himself morally perverse , for he is only obeying a higher law which is above the human law laid down by the Legislature . He instinctively feels than he is really paying his tax in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept . A tax of 1 per cent . to 3 per cent . on a mortgage at 5 per 9LEMS AND REFORMS . 205 cent . he holds to be not taxation , but robbery , and he has the common-law right of self-protection against robbers . INDIANA 'S EXEMPTION LAW . The experience of these States has led to legislation on mortgage taxation . The legislatures of Michigan and Wisconsin both adopted bills in 1901 taxing mortgages as real estate , but allowing the mortgagor a deduction from the assessed value of his land to the amount of the mortgage . Both bills were vetoed by the governors on minor points , and will again be pressed for enactment . Indiana , in 1899 , enacted a remarkable law , exempting mortgaged property to an amount not exceeding $700 , or one-half the mortgage if that is less than $1,400 . Under this law the mortgage " deductions " for the State foot up $40,000,000 , and , since the mortgages are held mainly by non-residents , the State loses nearly that whole amount from the tax rolls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State court , but is now before the Supreme Court of the United States . INNOVATIONS IN CHICAGO . Even more revolutionary than the legislation of these three States have been the tax reforms in Chicago and the counties of Illinois . Under the Illinois constitution the law necessarily affects all counties alike , but it was drawn especially for Chicago , which now elects nearly one-half of the State Legislature . The tax situation in Chicago , six years ago , had become notoriously corrupt , and the popular impression throughout the country continues to give that city a black name , although it has now one of the most efficient and upright systems of municipal assessment to be found in the United States . There still remain evils and heritages of fiscal iniquity , but these are confined mainly to the collection of taxes , and to that part of local assessment which remains under the original jurisdiction of the State Board of Equalization . As far as the local assessment is concerned , the Chicago of to-day bears no resemblance to the Chicago of six years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and $5,000 to the assessor , now pays $9,000 in taxes and nothing to the assessor . The office of assessor , which , in the business districts , was formerly worth half a million dollars to the assessor and the party , is abolished altogether . NEW MACHINERY FOR ASSESSING CITY PROPERTY . The foundations of this reform are centralization and publicity . The city corporation had spread over the original town governments , which  | continued to elect the assessors . Consequently , where the ordinary town assessor protects his constituents against only county and State taxes , the Chicago assessors were called upon to protect them also against municipal and park taxes . In the course of thirty years this perverse emulation had brought down the assessed values of property to from 5 to 15 per cent . of true value , and the rate of taxation up to from 8 to 13 per cent. , according to the district . With such a rate , the incentive to undervaluation was still further augmented , since a reduction of $100 in a man 's assessment saved him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1895 abolished the town assessors and substituted a county board of five assessors , elected at large for terms of six years . It also created a board of review of three members elected at large , one member at each election , for a term of six years . When the assessors have made their valuations , a printed slip is made out for each ward , containing the description of each piece of real estate and its assessment . This is sent to every taxpayer in the ward or district . In this way every person knows the assessments of his neighbors , and can make appeal , if he wishes , to the Board of Review . " PERSONAL " VALUATION QUADRUPLED . Similar lists are sent to the owners of personal property . But in this case the lists are made out for each line of business , and are sent to all the taxpayers appearing on the list . In addition , the Board of Review selects a committee of citizens from each " line , " and submits the list to them for revision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rates them all according to the amount of business and regardless of the itemized schedules returned by each . At the present time there are more than 200 of these separate committees of citizens cooperating in the assessment machinery . The Board of Review accepts their ratings , but at the last assessment added 10 per cent . all around , in order to relieve real estate that much . This method of citizen assessment has resulted in raising the valuation of personal property in Chicago from $21,000,000 to $88,000,000 , but with the interesting outcome that the personal property tax has been transformed into something like a gross revenue tax ; for the board disregards the itemized schedules returned by business houses and accepts the proportionate ratings returned by the committees , based upon their judgment of the amount of business done by each house . Naturally , in each line , the stock of goods is proportionate to the amount of business , but it is assessed as a unit and no longer by items . The law is indeed conformed to by publishing the items as returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board are entered under the item " all other property , " and this item is now two-thirds of the personal property assessment . One notable feature of this practice is the entire elimination of mortgages from the lists , and the almost complete elimination of credits . While other parts of the State and other States pay attention to these items , the Chicago assessors lump them all together under their " unit rule " of assessment . ST . PAUL 'S PLAN OF BLOCK VALUATION . In the taxation of real estate , publicity has been carried to its highest perfection in St. Paul . In 1896 , the deputy assessor , Mr. W. A. Somers , invited the Chamber of Commerce and other bodies to select committees from the different sections of the city , who should place a frontfoot value on the middle lots of each block in the city . With these values before him , he constructed percentage tables showing the variations to be allowed for different depths and for corner lots . He then plotted convenient sections of the city on large charts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he invited on successive evenings the citizens and residents interested in the particular sections announced for review . Criticisms were made , and the corrected valuations were then transferred to the assessment rolls . This practice applied only to ground values , and not to improvements . Buildings were assessed separately , under the supervision of a committee of architects and builders . This committee drew up a blank schedule for the description of buildings , and these schedules were filled out by clerks who inspected the properties . The schedules provided for a minute description of each building , showing the material of which it is constructed , the dimensions , projections , roof , outside finish , inside finish , method of heating , water-supply , drainage , number and character of rooms , sidewalk , etc . Following is one of the seventeen items taken from this schedule , showing the particularity with which the description is made . The clerk , in using the schedule , checks off by means of a circle the appropriate word descriptive of this feature of the building : Outside finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; stone , cut , rough . Trimmings : Plain , ornamental , stone , metal , wood . The schedules , when filled out , were returned to the committee of experts , who placed a value   per square foot on each building according to its description in the schedule . From this the clerks computed the total value of the building for taxation . This system of publicity and expert valuation has given complete satisfaction to the citizens of St. Paul , and has raised the problem of real-estate assessment from an amateurish guess to a scientific demonstration . The cost is no greater than that of the former guessing method . The system was recently adopted in Cleveland , and revealed some startling inequalities in preceding assessments . In Cleveland , the reassessment on the basis of the Somers system was conducted on an elaborate scale , and with great attention to detail , under the direction of the assessor , Peter Witt . A large number of charts were drafted , and the ground values of basing points in each ' block were determined at public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with other charts showing cash values and the appraised values of the preceding assessment . APPRAISAL OF BUIKLDING PROPERTY IN CITIES . The valuation of buildings was also centralized and systematized . Clerks were detailed with blanks for the description of each building , and these blanks , filled out , were put in the hands of an architect and builder , who went over the ground , taking the description with him . As he passed each building he set down his estimate of its value . The blanks were made out in such minute detail that this single assessor was able , with their help and his own practised eye , to assess all of the buildings in the city . The advantage of this centralized method lies in the fact that there are no conflicts of judgment between assessors , and every building in the city is rated proportionately and equitably with every other building . These valuations , like the valuations of the land , were also submitted to the taxpayers . FULL VALUATION IN NEW YORK CITY . A notable instance of what may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . In that city , the tax commissioners are appointed and removed by the mayor , and naturally they take instructions from him . In New York , as in all other cities and local governments which have not been reached by recent movements of tax reform , the valuation of property for assessment was considerably below the true value . This undervaluation had been brought about by the desire to escape as much as possible of the taxes for State purposes . But this motive has now been practically eliminated through the policy of the governor and the Legislature in recent years , directed to the segregation of sources of revenue for State purposes . With the direct State tax out of the way , the demand for assessment at full value gained strength through two considerations : ( 1 ) Equality and justice in taxation , and ( 2 ) a proposed increase of the bond-issuing capacity . The mayor pointed out that the old assessments ranged from 7 , per cent . to 130 per cent . of full value , and that equalization could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as required by law . The comptroller , in one of his addresses on the subject , said : The small property has generally been assessed higher than the larger property ; the small home at a higher rate than the business property , the hotel , office building , or apartment house ; the-improved property higher than the vacant ; the outlying boroughs higher than Manhattan ; the upper part of Manhattan higher than the lower ; though gross inequalities may be found even in a single borough , for there are sections of Brooklyn varying 30 per cent . from others . A sub-committee of the Citizens ' Union , which had nominated Mr. Low for mayor , and which contained an active element of so-called " singletaxers , " was especially persistent in pressing the argument of equality both before the public and before the mayor . This element was concerned mainly about the raising of assessments on vacant lots , which they expected would come through full assessment . That their objects have been in a measure realized seems to be borne out by the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated in an interview : " The raising of tax bills will redound to the benefit of the professional operators . It will tend to force holders of valuable unimproved or partially improved properties to let them go to those who can put them to good use . " The enormous debt of the city had nearly reached the limit of 10 per cent . of assessed value of real estate , established by the State constitution , and the city found itself unable to build schoolhouses , hospitals , police stations , fireengine houses , and to make dock improvements , required for its rapidly growing population . Raising the assessed valuation would add to the city 's borrowing capacity . With these two arguments , the mayor directed the tax commissioners , in 1902 , to assess all property at full value . The books were opened on January 12 , 1903 , and showed an increased valuation of real estate in Greater New York of $1,425,452,387 , the figures for 1902 being $3 , - 330,647,579 , and for 1903 being $4,756,099,966 . The normal increase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different boroughs . While the average is 208 THE AMERICAN MONTHL  | 40 per cent. , the increase for Brooklyn is only 27 per cent. , and that for Manhattan is 48 per cent . Brooklyn 's former assessments had been more nearly true value than those of Manhattan . Of course , increased assessment does not of itself increase the taxes , since the rate is thereby reduced . The rate in Manhattan , in 1902 , was 2.273 per cent. , and in 1903 it is estimated at 1.6 per cent . But increased assessment redistributes the taxes , since certain properties are increased in much greater proportion than others . Striking examples might be given . The Equitable Life Building was raised from $6,350,000 to $10,500,000 ; the Stock Exchange from x ; 2,100,000 to $4,600,000 ; Richard Oroker 's residence from $50,000 to $100,000 ; Mayor Low 's residence from $70,000 to $135,000 ; W. H. Vanderbilt 's residence from $700,000 to $1,500,000 . Vacant lots , in some instances , were raised more than threefold . It is not to be supposed that property is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finer shades of inequality are removed . The daily papers have contained comparisons showing that larger properties are now assessed at 75 per cent . to 90 per cent . of true value . The reasons for this can readily be understood when the personnel and procedure of the deputy assessors are considered . As stated by one of the daily papers : A deputy commissioner is assigned to a certain district or territory . He goes out with a book in which is written the tax valuation of last year of each piece of real estate in his district . He is supposed to walk around , look over the lots and buildings , and in ' another column enter in pencil his estimate of the value for this year of each piece . He may ask all the questions he wants to , but no owner or agent of a lot is compelled to tell him anything . Most of them , it is assumed , would tell him nothing if he announced his business . He may search the register 's office for records of transfers and mortgages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be classed as official information about the value of real estate in his district . For years , this system of assessment has been in this city generally regarded as one of pure guesswork on the part of the deputy , and one open to flagrant favoritism . The Mazet Committee brought out a mass of testimony intended to show that there had been favoritism in fixing valuations . A large number of the present deputy tax commissioners are Tammany hold-ovens , and all , or nearly all , have been appointed from civil-service lists . From this description , it can be seen how greatly superior is the Somers system , above described , wherein the ground is assessed separately from buildings and improvements and the citizens in each locality are called together in public hearing to decide upon true front-foot values , while an architect or builder is employed to appraise all the buildings on a uniform basis of comparison . The assessment of personal property in New York was also increased from $3,482,475,802 in 1902 to $4,420,326,945 in 1903. an increase of 27 per cent . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberal laws of New York in the matter of debt deductions the amount will be reduced to an unknown residuum . In Manhattan , last year , in the course of this " swearing-off " process , the personal property assessment of $3.004,869.916 was reduced to $412,388,258 , a reduction of 87 per cent . A FEW GENERALIZATIONS . Many suggestive details might further be cited showing the progress of tax methods and princi-ples in these and other States and localities . If one were to draw conclusions from both the attained and attempted reforms , up to the present time , he would have something as follows : Town assessors are tyros under the influence of constituents and supporters . County and city boards have greater experience and greater freedom . If town assessors are retained , they require the close supervision of a State board of experts . Interstate carriers and other large corporations can be fairly assessed only by a State board . The State board should be balanced by a union of appointive and ex-officio members , and should command the services of an engineer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts , abolishes corruption and secures equitable apportionment between members of a class . The listing of personal property by the assessor is inquisitive , crude , and ineffective . whereas the valuation of a business as a unit is the method naturally adopted by business men . The fairest method of assessment of real estate is assessment at full value , but this can not be expected until State revenues are secured in some other way than by a direct tax on real estate . and until land values are assessed separately and by different methods from improvements .
