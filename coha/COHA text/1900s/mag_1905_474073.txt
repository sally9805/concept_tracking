THE mutual interdependence be- tween the sciences is illustrated in a very interesting manner by the controversy which has raged intermittently for more than half a century , between representatives of physical science on the one hand and of geology and biology on the other , with regard to the important question of the age of the earth . The study of geology early showed that the surface of the earth had undergone profound changes in the past . This process of change is continuing slowly but surely to-day . Comparing the startling alterations which have occurred in the earth 's crust in the past , with the slowness of the changes taking place at.present , geologists were forced to the conclusion that an enormous amount of time must have been required to effect such results . In the early part of last century there were two great schools of geologic opinion with regard to the changes in the earth , one considering that the agents producing these changes acted with far greater intensity in the earlier epochs of the world , and the other ascribing the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with the element of unlimited time . This latter " Doctrine of Uniformity " in Geology , long since given up by geologists , is very clearly described in the famous passage by Playfair ( Illustrations of the linitonian Theory ) . The mathematicians had deduced that , if frictional forces were disregarded , the motions of the planets , though subject to periodic variations , were permanently stable . It was probably in reference to this that Playfair wrote : ? " How often these vicissitudes of decay and renovation have been repeated is not for us to determine ; they constitute a series of which , as the author of this theory has remarked , we neither see the beginning nor the end ; a circumstance that accords well with what is known concerning other parts of the economy of the world . . . The Author of elements of their own destruction . He has not permitted in His works any symptoms of infancy , or of old age , or any sign by which we may estimate either their future or their past duration . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beginning , to the present system , at some determinate time ; but we may safely conclude that this great catastrophe will not be brought about by any of the laws now existing , and that it is not indicated by anything which we perceive . " The study of fossil remains in the different geological strata had clearly brought to light that the forms of life existing at different times on the earth had passed through a series of stages . Darwin 's Origin of Species rendered it evident that the time demanded for the succession of life on the theory of evolution must be very great . Since , however , the different forms of life found in the successive geological strata indicate the stages of evolution , it is evident that the biological and geological clock is the same , and that whatever time is required for the changes in the one science must he conceded by the other . About the middle of the last century , the physicists , represented by Lord Kelvin ( then Professor Thomson ) , Tait , and Helmholtz , entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set a limit to the duration of life on the earth . Lord Kelvin has been the leader in this movement , and , in a series of remarkable papers , supplemented by a number of popular articles , he has concluded that the age of life on the earth can not probably be greater than one hundred million years . These eonelusions have been based on arguments of the duration of the heat of the sun and earth , and the action of tides in altering the period of rotation of the earth . Although Kelvin in this movement has gained the support of the majority of physicists , his conclusions have been subjected , at different times , to a considerable amount of adverse criticism , not only by geologists and biologists , but also by some representatives of astronomy and physics . Huxley took up the cudgels for the geologists , and , in the position of advocate , proceeded to discuss and criticise the data on which Lord Kelvin based his conclusions . The attitude of geologists at that time to this intrusion of physics into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Address , Geological Society , London , 1869 ) : " This result of Professor Thomson 's , although very liberal in the allowance of time , has offended geologists , because , having been accustomed to deal with time as an infinite quantity at their disposal , they naturally feel embarrassment and alarm at any attempt of the science of physics to place a limit upon their speculations . " This controversy has gone on intermittently for the last half-century . The geologists have attempted to form an estimate of the time required for the geological changes by measuring the rate of erosion of rocks and the rate of deposit of sediments in. different localities . These deductions are admittedly very uncertain , but , although there is considerable difference of opinion among geologists themselves , they are generally prepared to concede that probably one hundred million years would suffice . As fast as the geologists receded in their estimates , there has been a tendency of Lord Kelvin , with the increase of accuracy of the scientific data at his disposal , to still further cut down the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the various physical arguments advanced to set a limit upon the duration VOL . C%. ? No. 857 ? 49 of life upon this earth , the most important is based upon the calculation of the duration of the sun 's heat . It is obvious that the existence of life , as we know it , on this earth , depends upon a continuous supply of light and heat from the sun . Any considerable diminution of the present output of heat would at once cause a large portion of the earth 's surface to be uninhabitable , while if the sun were to go out , the surface of the earth would soon be reduced nearly to the temperature of absolute zero , and all forms of life would disappear . The argument which depends on the duration of the earth 's underground heat , although of secondary importance , is of great interest as fixing a possible limit from data derived from a study of the earth alone . The deduction based on the effect of tidal friction in causing a gradual retardation of the period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not so direct , but serves to contradict the old doctrine of uniformity in geology . Lord Kelvin has calculated that , in all probability , the earth one hundred million years ago rotated about three per cent . faster than to-day , and if we go back to a farther period of ten thousand million years , the earth must have rotated twice as fast . The centrifugal force due to the earth 's motion must have then been four times as great , and , in consequence , the shape of the earth and the distribution of land and water would be very different from . that observed to-day . In this article only a brief resumi can be given of the arguments on which the age of the sun and earth has been deduced . We will first consider the question of the age of the earth 's heat . Observations of bores and mines in different localities of the earth have shown that the temperature of the earth rises as we proceed downwards . The amount of rise varies somewhat . at different points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an average it is found that the temperature rises about 1-50 ' F. for every foot of descent . At a depth of one mile the temperature would thus be about 100 ' F. higher than at the surface . In order to account for the underground heat of the earth , which manifests itself so markedly in volcanic outbursts , Lord Kelvin assumed that the earth was originally a very hot body and has gradually cooled down to its present state . . For the purpose of illustration , let us consider the case of a large sphere of rock which has been uniformly heated to a high temperature in a furnace and then left in the open air to cool . On account of the rapid loss of heat by radiation and convection , the outside shell of the rock will rapidly become cool . The interior of the rock will , however , preserve a high temperature for a long interval . In order for the interior of the rock to cool , the heat must be conducted outwards through the mass of the rock . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very bad conductor of heat . At any time during the cooling , there will be a gradual rise of temperature from the outside to the centre . Now Fourier 's celebrated solution of the equations of heat conduction allows us to calculate the temperature at any point of the rock at any time after the cooling has commenced , provided the initial temperature , as well as the conductivity and specific heat , of the rock is known . Conversely , if the temperature at any definite point of the rock is observed , we should be able , by means of the theory , to calculate how long the rock has been cooling . This is exactly the problem that confronted Lord Kelvin in calculating the duration of the earth 's heat . The earth may be considered as a sphere of rock of about eight thousand miles in diameter . Given the earth is initially heated to a definite high temperature and then left to cool , how long will it take before the temperature gradient of the surface of the earth is equal to that observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the time required for cooling to the present state will evidently be longer , the higher the initial temperature of the earth . In order to obtain a maximum estimate of the time required , Lord Kelvin assumed the whole earth was initially at the temperature of molten rock , and deduced that about one hundred million years would be required for the earth to cool down from that temperature to its present state . The calculation is uncertain within fairly wide limits , on account of our ignorance of the way in which the conductivity and specific heat of the rock of the earth vary under the influence of great pressure and temperature . In a recent communication ( Philosophical Magazine , 1899 ) , Kelvin has still further cut down the estimate and has concluded that the age of the earth " is more than twenty and less than forty million years , and probably much nearer twenty than forty . " The middle of last century was marked by the establishment of the great principle of the conservation of energy . One of the first fruits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the origin of the sun 's heat . He supposed that the energy continuously radiated from the sun was kept up by a gradual contraction of its bulk due to the action of the force of gravitation . Following the famous nebular hypothesis of Kant and Laplace , the sun was originally supposed to be formed by the coalescence either of a vast nebula or a number of smaller bodies , which fell together under the influence of gravitational attraction . We know that the energy of motion of a bullet on striking a target is partly converted into heat and in consequence the bullet becomes hot . In the same way , when a body falls into the sun it acquires in its descent a high velocity and its energy of motion on striking the sun is finally converted into heat . As the sun 's mass became more concentrated , heat was thus developed , part of which was used up in raising the temperature of the sun and part of which was lost by radiation into space . From the determinations of Pouillet and Langley , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that supplied by the burning of about fifteen hundred pounds of coal per hour on every square foot of the sun 's surface . Notwithstanding this enormous radiation of energy , Helmholtz calculated that the heat generated in the sun through its contraction would be enough for the sun to shine with his present brightness fur a period of about forty million years . The calculation is uncertain within limits , for we do not know how the density of the sun varies from the centre outwards . Kelvin came to a very similar conclusion and stated that " it seems , therefore , on the whole most probable that the sun has not illuminated the earth for one hundred million years , and almost certain that he has not done so for five hundred million years . As for the future , we may say , with equal certainty , that inhabitants of the earth can not continue to enjoy the light and heat essential to their life , for many million years longer , unless sources now 21 ribLOWTI to us are prepared in the great storehouse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of the discovery of a body like radium which emits an enormous quantity of energy . He also concluded that , in all probability , the present output of the sun 's heat could not last much more than five or six million years , Helmholtz pointed out that the heat of the sun could not be explained by chemical action . Ho calculated that if the sun were composed of hydrogen and oxygen , mixed in the proportions required to form water , the heat generated by their combination would not suffice to keep up the present radiation of heat from the sun for more than four thousand years , and yet these substances in combining emit more heat than any other chemical reaction known . In a similar way , Kelvin showed that ordinary chemical action was not sufficient to explain the presence of the internal heat of the earth . While the heat supplied by possible chemical combination is quite inadequate to account for the heat of the sun and earth , the recent discovery that the radioactive bodies are able to emit. an amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most violent chemical reaction , throws quite another light on the question . These radioactive bodies , among which the best known are radium , uranium , thorium , and actinium , are mostly found in the mineral pitchblende . Attention has recently been concentrated on the substance radium , which emits heat and other forms of energy at a rate that appeals to the lay and scientific mind alike . The radiations from radium , which are able to produce such marked luminous , photographic and electrical effects , are qualitatively very similar to those emitted by the other radioactive bodies , already mentioned , but differ from them in intensity . Weight for weight , radium emits energy more than a million times faster than uranium or thorium . In addition to its penetrating radiations , radium also emits heat at a comparatively rapid rate . Curie and Laborde recently observed the striking fact that a piece of radium always keeps itself at a temperature of several degrees above the surrounding air . The amount of heat emitted from radium is sufficient to melt more than its weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is continuous and , so far as observation has gone , does not decrease appreciably with the time . In the course of a year , one pound of radium would emit as much heat as that obtained from the combustion of one hundred pounds of the best coal , but at the end of that time the radium would apparently be unchanged and would itself give out heat at the old rate . It can be calculated with some confidence that , although the actual amount of heat per year to be derived from the radium must slowly decrease with the time , on an average it would emit heat at the above rate for about one thousand years . But a still more remarkable fact remains to be noticed . Dr. Barnes and the writer showed that more than three-quarters of the heating effect of radium was due to the radioactive emanation stored in it . This emanation is a heavy radioactive gas , continuously generated in minute quantity by the radium itself . The emanation , released by heating or dissolving the radium , was collected in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this emanation-tube was found to give out seventy-five per cent . of the heat originally emitted from the radium , although the amount of emanation present was too minute to observe either by its volume or weight . At the same time the heating effect of the radium was cut down to one-quarter . The rate of heat emission of the emanation died away in a geometrical progression with the time , falling to half value in about four days . The radium compound from which the emanation had been separated , on the other hand , spontaneously regained its heating effect in the course of one month . Sir William Ramsay and Mr. Soddy have recently found that the volume of the radium emanation stored in one gram of radium is about one cubic millimetre at atmospheric pressure and temperature . The emanation is known to be a heavy gas , and , taking its molecular weight to be one hundred times that of hydrogen , it can be readily calculated that if one pound weight of the emanation could be collected , it would initially radiate energy at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of heat would fall off with the time , but the total amount of energy liberated during its life corresponds to that required to drive an engine of 10,000 horse-power for five days . Since there is little doubt that a quantity of radium , Left to itself , would in the course of time completely change into the emanation and other products , we see that at ' least an equal quantity of energy must he given out by radium during its transformation . According to present views , the emission of heat is a consequence of a breaking up of the radium atom into a succession of radioactive products . The disintegration is explosive in character , and is accompanied by the projection of a flight of material particles with great velocity . These projected particles , known as a particles , have about the same mass as the helium atom and are probably , indeed , atoms of helium . They are expelled with a velocity of about twenty thousand miles per second , and thus possess an energy of motion enormous compared with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily stopped by matter , and the greater proportion of those emitted from a piece of radium are absorbed by the radium itself . Their energy of motion is transformed into heat in situ , and the radium , in consequence , is heated by its self-bombardment . In a similar way , the heating effect of the emanation and its products is due to the intense bombardment of the walls of the containing vessel by the a particles , which are expelled at the moment of its disintegration . Since all the radioactive bodies emit particles , each of them probably emits heat at a rate proportional to its radioactivity . The heating effect of uranium is probably only about one-millionth part of that shown by an equal weight of radium . Although the radioactive substances are found in the greatest quantity in pitchblende , radioactive matter has been found to be distributed to a minute extent throughout the atmosphere and the earth 's crust . Much of our information in this important field has been due to the splendid work of Professors Elster and Geitel , teachers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radium and of other radioactive substances are present everywhere in the atmosphere . These radioactive gases possess the property of being transformed into a non - volatile kind of matter , which is deposited on the surface of bodies and can he collected on a wire charged with negative electricity . Every falling rain-drop and snowflake carries some of this radioactive matter to the earth , while every leaf and blade of grass is covered with an invisible film of radioactive material . These emanations are not produced in the air itself , but arc exhaled from the earth 's crust , which is impregnated with radioactive matter . If a pipe is let down into ordinary garden soil , the air which is sucked up is found to be markedly radioactive . The air in confined spaces like caves and cells is , in most cases , very radioactive on account of the presence of emanations which have diffused from the soil . The radium emanation has been found in the water from deep wells and springs , in surface and lake water , in escaping natural carbonic acid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many hot springs has been found to contain an unusually large quantity of radium emanation . Elster and Geitel have shown that the soil itself is radioactive to varying degrees , the activity being most marked in clayey deposits . The mud or " fango " deposited from a hot spring in Battaglia in North Italy was found to contain a very large quantity of radioactive matter . Indeed nearly every substance that has been tested has been found to possess this property to a slight extent .. The method of detection of the feeble radioactivity observed in ordinary matter depends upon the property of the radiations of causing a discharge of an electrified body . As a means of detection of radioactive matter , the gold-leaf electroscope far transcends in delicacy even the spectroscope ; for with only a gram of matter , the presence of radium to the extent of only one part in one hundred thousand million can readily he detected . If a large amount of matter is available for testing , the presence of much smaller quantities of radium per unit mass can readily be observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously expelling a particles , heat must be evolved in amount proportional to the quantity of active matter present and to the intensity of its radiations . The question then arises , Is the amount of radioactive matter present in the earth sufficient to heat it to an appreciable extent ? I think that , even with our present knowledge , this question must be answered in the affirmative . Taking the value of the conductivity of rock used by Lord Kelvin , and knowing the average temperature gradient , the amount of internal heat lost per second from the earth by conduction to its surface can readily be calculated . Since one gram of radium emits enough heat each hour to raise one hundred grams of water through 1 ? C. , a simple calculation shows that the present loss of heat from the earth is equivalent to that supplied by the presence of about two hundred and seventy million tons of radium . This amount may seem very large compared with the small quantities of radium hitherto separated , but is small , for example , compared with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily be deduced that this amount of radium , if distributed uniformly throughout the earth 's crust , corresponds to only five parts in one hundred million million per unit mass . This is a very small quantity , and calculations based on the observations of Elster and Geitel show that the radioactivity observed in soils corresponds to the presence of about this proportion of radium . In some soils it is greater , in others less , and in this calculation no account has been taken of the depesits of uranium and thorium materials . A large amount of observations of the materials of the earth for radioactivity will be required before such a conclusion can be considered to be established , but the magnitude of the radioactivity observed is certainly suggestive . In this calculation it is not assumed that the radioactivity of the soil is due to radium alone . Other kinds of radioactive matter arc undoubtedly present , but , for simplicity , the results are expressed in terms of that amount of radium in the soil required to exhibit the observed radioactivity . If radioactive matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment indicates , the heat evolved by the radioactive matter would compensate for the heat lost by the earth by conduction to the surface . According to this view , the present internal heat of the earth tends to be maintained by the constant evolution of heat by the radioactive matter contained in it . The calculations of the age of the earth made by Lord Kelvin , which were based on the theory that the earth was a simple cooling body in which there was no further generation of heat , can not apply , for the present temperature gradient of the earth may have been nearly the same for a long interval of time . Whether the internal heat of the earth was in the first place due to the presence of radioactive matter or to other causes is a very debatable question , for the answer involves considerations of the origin of the earth as a member of the solar system . Whatever view may be taken of this problem , there can be no doubt that the discovery of the distribution of radioactive matter in the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of the earth which are based on the assumption that it is a simple cooling body , and tends to show that the present internal heat will be maintained for a much longer interval than was at first supposed . On this theory of the maintenance of the internal heat , no definite limit can be set for the age of the earth , but some deductions can be made of the probable variation of the internal heat with time . The experimental evidence at present obtained points to the conclusion that a quantity of radium left to itself would be half transformed in about one thousand years . If the whole world had originally been composed of pure radium , its activity twenty thousand years later would not be greater than that observed in pitchblende to-day . Since the earth is much older than this , in order to account for the presence of radium at all , it is necessary to suppose that radium is a transition element continuously produced by the breaking up of some other substance . In this respect , radium behaves like its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the radium breaks up much more slowly . The most likely parent of radium is the element uranium , with which it is always found associated in pitchblende . This view has recently obtained strong experimental support . Tioltwood of New Haven has shown that the quantity of radium present in different varieties of pitchblende is always proportional to the amount of uranium . In addition , the amount of radium found in pitchblende is about what is to be expected if radium is a disintegration product of uranium . This question of the origin of radium is now being vigorously attacked by several investigators , and a definite answer will probably soon be forthcoming . If uranium is the parent of radium , the amount of radium present in the earth will at all times be proportional to the amount of uranium , so that the duration of radium is dependent on the life of uranium . It is probable that uranium or thorium would be half transformed in one thousand million years , so that if the radioactive matter in the earth is mainly derived from the breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to he expected that the heat generated ? in the earth would fall to half value in about one thousand million years . The earth would thus cool very slowly with the time and must have been hotter in past times , but no estimate of the age of the earth can be made from the amount of internal heat observed to-day . Some speculations regarding the effect of radioactive matter in prolonging the possible duration of the sun 's heat will now be considered . It will be remembered that Kelvin arrived at the conclusion that the present output of light and energy would , in all probability , not continue for more than five or six million years . A simple calculation shows that the presence of radium in the sun to the extent of only 2.5 parts per million of its mass would account for the present rate of emission of energy . There is no direct evidence that radioactive matter exists in the sun , but , from the similarity of the chemical constitution of the sun andearth , its presence is to be expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun , arid this is an indirect indication of the presence of radioactive matter , for Ramsay and Soddy have found that helium is continuously evolved from radium . A small trace of radioactive matter in the sun would not suffice to sensibly prolong the present estimate of the duration of the sun 's heat , but there is another possibility in this connection that must not be overlooked . It is not unlikely that under the influence of the very high solar temperature . the atoms of the non-radioactive elements may break up into the simpler forms with the evolution of a large quantity of energy . The present electrical theory of matter demands that the atoms of the heavier elements contain an enormous quantity of latent energy , which would be released when the atoms break up . If this store of atomic energy is available in the sun , and if ordinary matter in breaking up emits as much heat as radium , then it can be deduced that the duration of the sun 's heat would be prolonged for about one hundred times the estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Norman Lockyer showing that the hottest stars apparently consist of only the simpler forms of matter like helium and hydrogen , while the cooler stars show the presence of the heavier elements , support the view that the elements arc broken up into simpler forms under the action of intense heat . If this heat of atomic disintegration is available , it would suffice to keep up the present output of energy from the sun for about five thousand million years ? a period of time which probably both geologists and biologists would consider sufficient for the processes of organic evolution , while the duration of the sun 's heat in the future may possibly be extended for a hundred times the estimate made by Kelvin . Although such considerations may increase our estimate of the probable duration of the sun 's heat , science offers no escape from the conclusion of Kelvin and Helmholtz that the sun must ultimately grow cold and this earth must become a dead planet moving through the intense cold of empty space .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
