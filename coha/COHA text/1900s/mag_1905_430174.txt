 | Professor of History and Economics in Emory College Nearly all modern States levy taxes on their citizens for the support of higher education . According to the decisions of the courts and the text-books on finance , taxation must be for a public purpose ? that is to say , the revenues from taxation must be expended for the common benefit . In some cases an act of the government results not only in the promotion of the public welfare , but also in a special benefit to the individual concerned . In such a case the individual is properly called upon to pay a fee , covering a portion of the cost , for the benefit conferred . To this class belongs the work of the State in higher education . Undoubtedly there is a benefit of a high order conferred on the recipient of college instruction , and he is rightly required to pay a portion of the cost in the form of a tuition fee . Considering the cost of the service and the individual nature of the benefit conferred , it may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the cost on the student . What is here insisted on , however , is that there is a common as well as individual benefit in the maintenance by the State of educational institutions . If the work of the institutions were limited to the conferring of a special benefit on those of its citizens who might receive instruction in their walls , the collection from the whole people of revenue for their support would in nowise be either justifiable or constitutional . It is only because of the public nature of the service rendered that any educational institution can be legally supported by public funds . The work of the college or university is public , because its benefits are diffused . Because of the superior education of those students who in later life are legislators , laws for the whole people are more wisely enacted . Because of the superior education received by those students who become judges and administrative officers , the laws are the better interpreted and executed . Other students , on account of higher education , become better physi- cians , better ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in this way the general public receives benefits from institutions maintained by public funds . If without State aid to higher education a sufficiently large Now , proportion of citizens were well prepared for leadership in college under private or church control , there would then be no need or justification for the State to enter this field . What the State does in this realm should properly be considered as supplementary to what is done by non-State agencies . There is doubtless no State in the Union better provided with colleges and universities than Massachusetts , nor any State having a larger proportion of highly educated citizens ; yet this State does not support any academic institution of higher education , nor does there appear to be any reason why it should do so . Years ago Massachusetts founded its Institute of Technology , there being at that time no school of this kind in the State , and in this way it supplemented the institutions already in existence . In 1890 Georgia established its first State institution for the education of girls . This college was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its title , " The Georgia Normal and Industrial College , " indicates the nature of the work done , and there was then no similar institution in the State . If , again , it were possible to maintain colleges and universities by tuition charges there might not have been any need for State aid to higher education , but everyone knows that there is not a college of high grade in America so supported . Trinity College ( N. C. ) for example has about 400 students and charges a tuition fee of $50.00 . If all the students paid this fee it would mean an income of $20,000.00 , which would give less than $700.00 to each of the professors and instructors . This would not allow anything for running expenses or for the use of a valuable plant . The entire tuition fees would not in fact provide for the cost of grounds , buildings , library , and laboratories . The relation of the State to higher education is analogous to its relation to infant industries , as this , at least , is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain itself unaided because of foreign competition . But the existence of the industry in this country would be for the public good , and so it is proper for the State to impose a burden on the public by means  | of tariffs or bounties in order to protect the young industry . In this way the State does not start factories , but it aids those already in existence and encourages the organization of more . Now , higher education is an industry which is not self-supporting ? not because of any competition , but from the very nature of the case . One method of aid would be for the State to appropriate to each college within its territory money proportionate to the amount and quality of work done , such aid being supplemental to the usual fees . Such a plan has , in fact , been used in England with respect to elementary education . Much can be said in favor of this method of aid , but doubtless more against it . It has never found favor in this country . The States have aided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been kept under their control . Now , the work done by colleges not controlled or supported by the State is of a public character . President Eliot says : " The reason for treating these institutions in an exceptional manner is that , having no selfish object in view or purpose of personal gain , they contribute to the welfare of the State . Their function is largely a public function ; their work is done primarily , indeed , for individual , but ultimately for the public good . . . . The fact that the property of these public trusts is administered by persons who are not immediately chosen or appointed by the public obscures to some minds the essential principle that the property is really held and administered for the public benefit ; but the mode of administration does not alter the use , or make the property any loss property held for the public . " A State is as much benefitted in having one of her sons trained in a non-State college as in one controlled and supported by the State . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it educated George F. Pierce , who became one of the bishops of the Southern Methodist Church . Emory College did a similar service in training Atticus G. Haygood , who also was one of the bishops of the same church . E. Y. Atkinson , one of the governors of Georgia , was educated by the State University , while Allen G. Candler , another governor , was graduated from Mercer University , a Baptist institution . The non-State colleges serve the State as truly and as effectively as those institutions maintained by public taxation . If , then , the State believes that the cause of higher education is  | of so much importance that it taxes the people in its interests , and if such institutions . ' can not be supported by tuition fees , the State ought in all fairness and consistency to relieve from taxation college property the income from which is wholly spent in this public work of higher education . This is the main argument for the exemption of college endowments . Other reasons , however , can be given . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again : " For the public to enact laws which tend to discourage private persons from giving property to the public for its own use is as unwise as for the natural heir to put difficulties in the way of a well-disposed relative who is making his will . " Not to exempt such endowments from taxation , and at the same time to maintain institutions of higher education from public revenue , is almost equivalent to the governing powers saying : " We should prefer to tax the people in order to educate them in institutions under State control , rather than have higher education provided otherwise and without cost to the public treasury . " For the State to provide these institutions at a merely nominal cost to the student , and at the same time to tax endowments of colleges where a tuition charge is necessary , is to pursue a policy the tendency of which is to weaken all but the State institutions and those already well endowed . The policy of exemption is a fair one with respect to the very large proportion of citizens who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send their children to the non-State institutions . Some objections , however , are made to this policy of exemption even by those who recognize the benefits accruing to the State from the work of the private and denominational colleges . One objector will ask why factories should not also be exempted from taxation since they do much good to the community by furnishing employment and increasing trade . The answer to this is easy . Factories undoubtedly may be of great benefit . However , they not only pay expenses , but when well conducted yield profits to their owners . As a general rule the factory which does not pay expenses , and profits besides , is not a benefit , but a detriment , to society . It has already been pointed out that no institution of higher education can be maintained by tuition fees . These fees must be supplemented by income from endowments or grants  | from the State . If this were not so the support by the State of its own colleges would be a needless and an unreasonable burden on the taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges from taxation would involve a union of church and State . A union of church and State implies that one of the two is subject to the control of the other in whole or in part . One of the most clearly defined and emphasized principles of our government has been the separation of church and State ; yet church buildings have always in this country been exempt from taxation . If this does not involve a union of church and State , why does the exemption of college property involve such a union ? The exemption laws , however , do not apply to denominational institutions as such , but include all colleges and universities not operated with a view to profit . Some of the most notable and most useful institutions , such as Harvard , Cornell and Johns Hopkins , are under neither State nor denominational control . Another objection that is sometimes offered is that exemption would result in unequal competition . Let us examine this . Suppose two stores of equal value and desirability , side by side , one belonging to a college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield exactly the same rental . If the private citizen has invested in the building the savings of a life time , it would not enable him to get any higher rent than if the property had come to him as the unexpected bequest of a distant relative . Neither will the fact of the exemption or taxation of college property affect the rental . Each owner will get the highest rental that can be had . Certainly there is no inequality here as between the occupiers or renters . But what of the owners ? Suppose the net rental , including taxes , to be $1,000 and suppose taxes to be $200 ; the private owner would pay this amount to the State to be used in some way for the public benefit , and the $800 he could and would use just as he pleased . Now , if there is exemption the college trustees receive an income of $1,000 , all of which is used for the public benefit in the cause of education . The trustees are under moral and legal obligation to make this use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divert the funds they could be enjoined by judicial process . There is no hardship to the private owner that the trustees be given the privilege of using the entire net income of the building for a public purpose .  | Another may claim that the State has need of all obtainable revenue and therefore can not afford to allow any exemption . Considering the laxity with which the present laws are administered this objection can hardly be a sincere one . The taxation of endowments , moreover , would simply divert funds from one kind of public use to another and would not increase the amount of revenue for public purposes . An ideal law , in the writer 's opinion , would exempt from State taxation all property of whatever description owned by educational institutions . Personalty , such as endowment funds , should be exempted from local taxation also , for the local government is usually put to no trouble or expense because of such property . Grounds and buildings directly and immediately used by the college in the work of education should also be exempted from local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education are local only in a small degree , there is much local benefit from the money expended in the community by the students and professors It hardly seems fair however that all real estate not directly used in the work of the college should be exempted from local taxation . If a certain piece of property had been yielding taxes to a city why should its treasury suffer loss when the property is purchased by a college which may be a hundred miles away . The income is used for the public work of education , it is true , but it is the State and not the city government that undertakes this work . It is quite possible that all the real estate so owned in the State might be in one or two localities , in which case those local treasuries and those only would suffer a loss of revenue . It would be well if the State treasurer would pay back to the treasurer of the college the money paid for local taxes , as is done in Maine , though the average citizen or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to prevent a certain possible abuse the State might well require that as a condition of exemption the entire income of property exempted should be used directly in the work of education . Suppose for example a given piece of property to net a clear income of five per cent . after a payment of two per cent . for taxes . A college might borrow money at five per cent . to buy this building and it would net seven per cent . to the col- lege . After payment of interest two per cent . would be left with which to reduce the principal . In about twenty-five years the college would own the property without incumbrance . During this time , while the treasuries of the State and local government have suffered a loss , there has been because of the exemption no increase of expenditures in the State for higher education . As to existing laws , California is the only State that does not exempt from taxation the grounds and buildings of colleges not operated with the purpose of private profit , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , University and the California School of Mechanical Arts . Eight States exempt no more than grounds and buildings . Twenty-six States exempt in addition endowments in the form of personal property . Of this number at least four also exempt buildings owned by colleges and occupied by its professors or officers . Pennsylvania and New Hampshire seem to have special rather than general laws on the subject of exemption . Connecticut exempts all endowment funds and also real estate of Yale , Wesleyan and Trinity , each to the extent of an annual rental of $6,000 . The laws of Maine are unique . Personalty is exempt but not real estate aside from college grounds and buildings . The treasurer of the State , however , will refund to the college treasurer taxes , State and local , on such real estate to the amount of $1,500 annually . In this way the college is relieved within the limit named of all taxes , while the cost of relief from local taxes is borne by the State as a whole rather than by the localities in which the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of exemption is Brown University of Rhode Island . That University enjoys not only the exemption of all its property from taxation , both State and local , but each professor is exempted to the amount of $10,000 . Only four States , Delaware , Kentucky , North Carolina and South Dakota , exempt from taxation all property of colleges . North Dakota exempts all personalty and all real estate to the amount of forty acres for each college . In the charters of a few colleges it is stipulated that their property , in whole or in part , shall be free from taxation . The Supreme Court of the United States in the Dartmouth College case declared such charters to be contracts and they may not be impaired by subsequent legislation . A statute law exempting property is not a contract and it may be abolished at the pleasure of the legislature .
