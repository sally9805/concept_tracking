In most of these aspects of Madison 's career Mr. Hunt is not a blind admirer , he admits the errors of judgment and the inability to judge of men , which brought together so weak a Cabinet and permitted 86 ' much discord among it Members . With a ' tendency to overestimate Madison 's initiative in legislation , Mr. Hunt does not blink or justify his resort to scurrilous journalists or political tactics but little defensible Overlooking Madison 's essay on Neutral Rights , Mr. Hunt gives an interesting extract from-a fragment by Madison showing that slavery is incompatible with democ --  racy Mr. Hunt has also dwelt on the subject of patronage and its abuse under Jefferson , and on nullification in South Carolina , topics well deserving the space given to them . He has studied with care original sources of material , and a high degree of accuracy is maintained throughout the book Corbett for Cobbett is the worst of the few errors . It is the best life we have of Madison , and a decided improvement on former biographies . Italy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co . This is a volume such as one gladly sees , well printed on good paper , with clear illustrations , all from familiar Alinari photographs The author loves his Italy and is not devoid of intelligence , so that his pages may be read with pleasure , though , one would be slow to call the work successful . There are chapters on United Italy , II Papa-Re , The House of Savoy , The Socialists and Literature ( which for Mr. Hutton means chiefly the writings of Gabriele d'Annunzio ) , also upon the cities of Italy , upon half-a-dozen topics chosen rather capriciously out of the innumerable phases of Italian life , and an appendix with an itinerary for the hurried tourist , and slight ' notes on education , the political system , the army and navy . There are a good many clever things said by the way , and there are pages of delicious nonsense , relieved by occasional flashes of real eloquence , or even by passages of common sense Mr Hutton 's practice , however , is better than his preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowl , " and therefore loathes the Sardinian Government in Rome ; and yet , by various ? - - Signs , we divine that this is only in some Pickwickian sense Then , too , it is after having , through the entire 4O111m e , poured scorn and reviling on the tourist , that he shows himself capable of doing good to them he hates and despitefully uses , by furnishing an itinerary ?

The aim of Mr. Weed 's rather pretentious book is to advocate a more general and discriminating use of flowers in the decoration of the house , and especially of the schoolroom , where flowers , even better than pictures , would serve to educate the eye to beauty of form and harmony of color . Several of the articles- included have already been published in the Ouse Beautiful and in Art Education Our author inveighs against the old-fashioned way of making compact masses of flowers . of every kind into the nosegay or bouquet , but in the prevailing enthusiasm for gardening which Pervades all classes , flowers receive a great deal of attention and preserve their identity - far more than when they were relegated to the choice of the gardener , so that , when gathered , each bloom is appreciated according to its importance Mr. Weed acknowledges his indebtedness to Japanese methods in much that he teaches  --  for instance , simplicity of back ' - ground for flowers arranged in vases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the keeping each kind of flower by itself , or grouping at most two different ' flowers or two colors together , and showing as much as possible the growth of flowers and leaves . He very justly advises the use of flowers and branches from our own woods , fields , and gardens- for decoration , rather than buying exotics and forced flowers out of season from shops . In this , also , he conforms to Japanese customs : we are told that in Japan it would be regarded asequally out of place to use summer flowers in winter for decoration as to wear ' winter clothes in summer . There are plentiful illustrations of Mr. Weed 's floral arrangements , with suggestions as to combinations of color in flowers and vases , and advices as to the different kinds of pottery , Oriental and indigenous , fittest for use We doubt whether the book will be of any great help , for all matters of decoration - depend on individual taste and feeling .
