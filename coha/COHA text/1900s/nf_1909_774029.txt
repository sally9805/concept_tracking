txt zoo INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS income of the company . An additional hundred cars may increase the number of passengers carried by an average of twenty-five for each additional car ; still another hundred may increase the number of passengers carried scarcely at all . 8 . The principle of diminishing returns comes into operation when the amount of labor increases , while the amount of capital remains fixed . The clement in production which operates to limit the expansion of a given business may be capital in its general form , not any concrete productive ' good . It is a fortunate business man who finds his capital limited only by the possibilities of profitable employment which he commands . In practical life a man can secure for use in his business , besides his own capital , only the additional capital for which he can give security . And this is usually limited to some proportion of the value of his own property . Assuming that a manufacturer possesses a capital of $50,000 , and can borrow $50,000 more , the sum $ioo , 000 limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his production could do . He has , of course , many choices as to the exact disposition of the capital . If he is engaged in cotton manufacture , he may use first-class machinery , or he may employ a poor grade of machines ? perhaps machines that have been discarded in other sections , as was for a long time a common practice in the South . He may decide upon investing $50,000 of his capital in looms , and the remainder partly in the building and partly in materials , etc . With twenty-five laborers and high-grade looms , the output per laborer will be high ; with fifty laborers and lower grade looms , the output per laborer will probably be less , although the total output of the mill will be increased . A third force of twenty-five laborers with a still cheaper grade of looms will add something to the total output , but the output per man will be still further THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS roi diminished . Perhaps the output per man , when twenty-five are employed , will be $2000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man may be $1900 . Seventy-five men , with the capital put into appropriate form , might produce $i800 per man . With one hundred men , the returns per man might be $ 1700 , and with each further addition to the number of men a corresponding decrease iii product per man might take place , until at last additional laborers added nothing to the output . 9 . The principle of diminishing returns is of universal application in the field of production . Wherever one element in production is fixed , while the other factors in production increase , the principle of diminishing returns inevitably operates . Wherever one factor in production increases , while the other factors increase at a more rapid rate , the law of diminishing returns operates , but in modified form . If the labor and movable capital of society increase while the natural resources at the command of society fail to increase , diminishing returns appear , as in the individual establishments of our examples . We may now state the law of diminishing returns in its general form . When any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is limited in quantity , either absolutely , or by conditions of increasing cost , while the quantity of the other factors may be increased practically without limit , every unit of increase in the variable factors results in an increase of output less than proportionate to the increase in the variable factors . 10 . Economy in production is at its maximum when the final expenditure on the variable factors just equals the return to those factors . The manufacturer who erects a mill to utilize the power obtained by damming a stream , is limited in his operations by the power represented by the head of water . This is the fundamental limiting element in his calculations . But // it is not to be supposed that the power which he will actually obtain is a definite quantity . Human ingenuity has devised no means whereby all the power actually resident in any natural source may be transmuted into a form which lends itself to use . All our devices for securing and transmitting power are imperfect ; the best of them are only less wasteful of energy than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs little but permits a large part of the power to go to waste , or he may install a more complicated and costly set of devices , which will come far nearer turning to account the whole power represented by the fall . We may think of the manufacturer as weighing the advantages of different kinds of power plant . The expenditure of $r000 will permit the utilization of , perhaps , one half of the power . A second $r000 may make it possible to utilize two thirds of the power . With a plant costing $3000 perhaps three fourths of the total power will be utilized . A $4000 plant may utilize four fifths of the power , and so on . At what point will it be more profitable to let power go to waste than to incur additional expense to save it ? One half of the power may have a value of $300 per year . Interest and depreciation on the $r000 necessary to obtain this power may amount to $150 . The value of the power which would be obtained through the $2000 plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $400 and the cost , figuring interest and depreciation as before , would be $300 . The simple plant therefore would yield a net value of $15o above cost ; while the more complicated plant would yield only $roo . It would accordingly pay best to install the $r000 plant . If the value of the power should double , however , while the cost of the several kinds of power installations remained unchanged , the $r000 plant would yield a value of $600 at a cost of $15o , leaving a net gain of $450 ; while the $2000 plant would give a power worth $boo at a cost of $300 , leaving a net gain of $500. // The $3000 plant would yield a power worth $900 , but at a cost of $450 . The net gain is evidently diminished through the installation of the $3000 plant . The $2000 plant is , under the circumstances , the most economical available . Were the value of the power again doubled , the $3000 plant would yield the highest surplus above cost , and so would be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent steam engine which transforms into mechanical power one sixth of the energy of the coal which it consumes . A simple and inexpensive type of engine does not do nearly so well as this . At a given place and time , will it be more economical to employ an engine of the very highest type , and which naturally is very costly , or an inexpensive engine of a simple type ? The former may transform into power fifteen per cent of the energy latent in the coal ; the latter , only five per cent . If the additional power obtained through the better engine does not equal the excess of interest and depreciation charge on the more costly engine , the simpler engine is the more economical in spite of its wastefulness from the mechanical point of view . A farmer should continue his application of labor and capital to land as long as the returns from additional units of labor and capital exceed their cost . If wages and interest decline , it becomes possible to increase the application of labor and capital to land without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivation may profitably be made more intensive if the prices of agricultural products rise . We have here an explanation of the fact that in old countries land is cultivated more intensively than in new countries . In the latter wages and interest are high and prices are low . 11 . The law of diminishing returns may be counteracted by improvements in production . Improvements in methods of production are constantly I04 INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS taking place , with the result that a given amount of labor or of capital increases in efficiency . If the amount of labor employed upon a hundred-acre field increases , the increase in product will not ordinarily be proportionate to the increase in labor . But if at the same time a new way of cultivating or fertilizing the soil is discovered , or if the quality of the seed is improved , the product may very well increase relatively to the amount of labor . This fact does not prove that the law of diminishing returns is non-existent . It merely proves that there are other forces at work which may , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , of the greatest practical importance , and will later demand our attention . Another qualification of the principle of diminishing returns consists in the fact that the very process of increasing the number of units of variable factors employed in connection with an unvarying factor may , under certain conditions , increase the productive efficiency of each unit of the varying factors . To employ two men on an acre of land that could be cultivated by one would result in a diminished return per man if ? each worked alone . But many tasks may be better performed when two or more men cooperate than when each works by himself . Accordingly , it may happen that an increase in labor which makes cooperation possible , or an increase in capital which makes possible better methods , may be accompanied by increasing , instead of diminishing , returns . 12 . Summary . In most businesses the enterpriser is subject to definite limitations in his control over one or more of the factors upon which his production is based , while he may be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the factors in a productive combination do not necessarily place an absolute limit upon the size of a business ; they do , however , imply that after a certain size has been reached , further expansion involves // disproportionate expense . This principle , known as the law of diminishing returns , is of universal applicability in the field of production . The greatest economy in production is attained when the returns to the last units of the variable factors in a business just equal the cost of those factors . Every reduction in the cost of one of the variable factors extends the scope of profitable application of that factor . The law of diminishing returns may often be counteracted by improvements in production ; in some cases this counteracting influence may be brought about by the very forces that tend to bring the law of diminishing returns into operation . CHAPTER VII THE SPECIALIZATION OF ECONOMIC FUNCTIONS 1 . In primitive conditions all the functions of wealth production are performed by the single kinship group , or family . At the dawn of civilization men lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be done was executed by all the men in cooperation , or by any member of the tribe indifferently . Some distinction there was between the work of men and that of women ; the former were in many cases engaged chiefly in hunting , the latter in root grubbing and in a primitive form of gardening . Economic differentiation , then , hardly existed . It is true that there was little occasion for the specialization of economic functions , since wants were few and economic functions were consequently simple . In many cases civilized men , have been placed in conditions that bear a superficial resemblance to those of primitive life . But the civilized man carries with him a great number of wants that the savage never experienced . We therefore find , in such conditions , a progress in the differentiation of economic functions taking place in a few decades , while in the history of the human race as a whole , differentiation was the result of thousands of years of development . In a frontier community , where almost the entire population consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed by each person are numerous and diverse . The frontiersman must , in the first place , be an agriculturist and a grazier . Each of these occupations includes numerous functions calling for different qualities , the agriculturist being a plowman , sower , reaper , etc . The frontiersman must also be a woodcutter Io6 // at times , a carpenter , a mason , a cabinet-maker , a smith , a butcher , and a hunter , not to speak of a host of miscellaneous functions that he must occasionally perform . His wife probably has a no less varied array of occupations . She is a cook , a laundress , a seamstress , a dairymaid , a spinner , a weaver , a nurse , and a teacher . To survive on the frontier one must be a jack of all trades . And practically the same range of duties falls upon the strong and the weak , the intelligent and the dull , the man who quickly acquires skill and the man who acquires it with great difficulty . 2 . The first stage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Were the frontier community wholly isolated for many generations , a transformation of its methods of production would gradually take place . A person with more than the ordinary talent for building would be called upon to assist in the construction of his neighbors ' houses , receiving in return assistance in work for which he had no special qualification . Little by little , occupations would be differentiated , and eventually the community would contain among its population carpenters , smiths , masons , weavers , etc . While these craftsmen might still own land , and spend their odd hours in agriculture , the main source of their livelihood would be the exercise of their several crafts . Specialization in the form known as differentiation of occupations would thus have come into existence . So long as differentiation of functions rests upon a direct exchange of services , it can not be carried far . Population would need to be fairly dense before a man could devote himself exclusively to the building of houses , even if he undertook the work of stone mason , brick mason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trades as that of locksmith could hardly exist at all , since a scattered rural population could scarcely furnish work enough to maintain it . zo8 INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS 3 . An important step in the direction of economic specialization was taken when men began to produce commodities for sale . In early modern times the development of trade gradually transformed production for the household into production for the market . This change first made its appearance in the woolen industry . At first , we may suppose , only the surplus of domestic production was placed upon the market of the town , or carried to fairs where a larger concourse of purchasers was to be found . In time production for domestic use became a mere incident ; the weaver came to depend on more or less distant markets for the sale of his wares . And this implied the purchase in the market of the materials of production . So we find German weavers in the fifteenth century carrying their wool from England and their finished products to southern and eastern Europe . Under these conditions there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of cloth . A great body of consumers was within his reach , and however special his product , he could devote himself exclusively to it . In like manner , traders would soon appear in the frontier community of our example , and carry away the lighter surplus products , giving in exchange the manufactured goods of older communities . A railroad would , in time , transform the frontier community into an integral part of the civilized world . Instead of weaving its own cloth , it would barter its surplus products of the soil for textiles produced in other parts of the world . The community as a whole would thus be specialized to the functions best adapted to its conditions . As the community advanced in numbers and wealth one function after another would be taken out of the province of the man of all work , and given over to persons specially qualified by nature and training to perform it effectively . Each trade , again , would tend to subdivide . The carpenter would no longer plan the building upon which he // worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The planing of boards would cease to be a part of the carpenter 's work , as planing mills would be established which would do the work far more economically . Even in agriculture some differentiation would take place ; one man would devote himself chiefly to the growing of grain , another to raising vegetables , etc . Owing to the seasonal character of agricultural labor , however , and the advantages of combining crops in such a way that the work may be distributed as evenly as possible throughout the open months , specialization in agriculture could not be carried very far . Indeed , even in the best developed agriculture , we do not find some farmers wholly devoted to wheat culture , others growing nothing but corn , others potatoes or turnips . Agriculture by its nature precludes a high degree of differentiation of functions . 4 . Differentiation of function in production is in large measure dependent upon the character of the existing commercial organization . In the medieval towns the artisan was at the same time a trader . He was compelled to supply himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often compelled to carry his wares from place to place in order to find purchasers . The risks incident to procuring materials and marketing products weighed heavily upon him . Cooperation , as in the German Hanse towns , reduced his difficulties in some measure ; nevertheless , under the conditions , comparatively few men could rely for their subsistence upon a single occupation . With the development of a merchant class , the producer was relieved of the labor and risks of assembling materials and marketing products . The accumulation of large and permanent stocks of material gave occasion for a constantly increasing number of occupations , or subdivisions of occupations . As an illustration of the effect of commercial developiio INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS ment upon the division of labor , we may cite the industry of shoe manufacture . One hundred years ago shoe making was carried on by independent cobblers , supplying a local demand . Every cobbler made many types of boots and shoes . At a somewhat later period , shoes had become an article of commerce , and the cobbler ceased to be dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of development , the commercial demand for shoes had become too important to allow the supply to remain dependent upon the enterprise of the independent cobbler . The merchant began to furnish material ready cut to be sewed and pegged by persons capable of doing the work , whether trained in the trade or not . In this stage the simpler processes were performed by one set of hands , the more complicated by another . Thus division of labor had succeeded differentiation of occupations . Further improvements in methods of marketing the finished product led to still more minute division of labor , under the factory form of organization . To-day each shoe goes through scores of hands before it is placed on the market as a finished product . A similar evolution may be traced in the ready-made clothing industry ? a still newer field . The retail and wholesale clothing trade has grown up in the last fifty years ; its increasing demands have given a stimulus to the differentiation of functions in the making of clothes . It is , of course , to be borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the differentiation of economic functions have proceeded concurrently . Each has been in part the effect , in part the cause , of the other . 5 . Improvements in transportation give occasion to increased specialization in industry . Division of labor first reached a high degree of development in centers enjoying water transportation . Until recent times , it was only at such centers that the more SPECIALIZATION OF ECONOMIC FUNCTIONS I l l bulky materials of industry could be assembled in sufficiently large quantities to permit extensive subdivision of functions ; furthermore , it was only from such centers that it was possible to carry bulky goods to a great number of consumers . The advent of the railway enabled inland cities to engage in highly specialized production . As railway service became better and cheaper , many forms of industry permitting a minute division of labor appeared .. Until refrigeration had been reduced to a science , and the methods of transporting products preserved by ice had been perfected , every locality depended for its supply of meat upon the local butcher . If the consumers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small shops which permitted only a low degree of division of labor . In the cities , the shops were larger , and division of labor was carried farther . To-day there is almost no limit to the market for a single establishment . Fresh meats from Chicago may be found in practically any city or town in the land . Fresh mutton killed in New Zealand and Australia finds a ready market in England . The parallel development of live stock transportation has given the slaughtering centers a practically unlimited supply of raw material . Accordingly , a minute division of labor has been evolved in the slaughterhouses . In the Chicago slaughterhouses the killing and dressing of a bullock is subdivided into fifty or sixty separate functions , each assigned to a separate set of workmen . Each set makes some small change in the material and passes it on to another set . Of course some functions are performed by single workmen , some by several . The laborers are organized in gangs of 230 men , each gang containing just the appropriate number of men of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of the consumer , division of labor is dependent largely upon the density of population . // Where the producer of a commodity deals directly with the consumer , the opportunity for minute division of labor is not so great as where the producer is brought into relation with the consumer through the intermediation of a general market . The amount of work that may be secured by a single custom-tailor 's shop is limited by the number of purchasers of custom-made garments within easy distance . In a village this number may be so small that anything like subdivision of the tailor 's trade is impracticable . In a large city the case is different . A single shop may easily find customers enough to keep . twenty men at work . In the latter case division of labor is entirely practicable . If transit facilities in the large city are excellent , the number of men that may be employed by a single tailoring establishment may be one hundred or more , and labor may be as minutely subdivided as the employer desires . In the making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations upon division of labor are found . The small town is able to support only a small shop , where all the work is performed by two or three men , while the large city renders possible the large shop , with minute subdivision of labor . 7 . The degree in which the functions of production may be subdivided is dependent upon the prevailing form of economic organization . Where each workman is his own employer , as was generally the case in the mediaeval industrial organization , labor can not be very minutely subdivided . In such an industrial organization the spinner buys his wool and sells his product to the weaver ; the latter sells the cloth to the fuller , who , in turn , sells it to the dyer . The product is again sold , perhaps , to the shearer , who in turn sells the finished cloth to the draper , who deals directly with the consumer . With such a form of organization much time is necessarily wasted in the buying and selling of the mateSPECIALIZATION // rial in its several stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater the waste from this source . Again , as each person follows his own taste in choosing his trade ? subject , of course , to family tradition and trade restrictions ? it is unlikely that the society will have just the right number of craftsmen of each kind . At one time there will be too many spinners , relatively to the number of weavers ; at another time fullers will be so numerous that not all can be employed . And this element of waste also increases with increasing subdivision of labor . Where , on the other hand , industry is carried on under the factory system , the workmen are assembled under one roof , subject to the control of an employer . The material passes through the shop without interruption , and apprentices are taken on in each branch in the proportions which experience shows to be most desirable . Of course this implies a large accumulation of wealth on the part of the employer , who must provide the premises , furnish materials , pay wages , and assume all other expenses of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficient management are prerequisites to a thoroughgoing system of division of labor . And , of course , efficient management on the part of the employer implies a corresponding readiness to submit to direction on the part of the employee . We might easily conceive of a society in which all other conditions requisite to division of labor might exist , but in which division of labor of an advanced type would , nevertheless , be impracticable on account of the restlessness of the working population under close direction . 8 . From a business point of view , the principal advantages of division of labor are ( I ) increased skill and speed in production ; ( 2 ) less waste of time ; ( 3 ) greater ease of supervision . To enumerate all the advantages of the division of labor would require a volume ; but we may group the more // important ones under a few heads . In the first place , the limitation of the labor to be performed by one man to a single function , which involves the use of a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple movements , makes possible accurate workmanship and great speed , with relatively little weariness . The workman soon reduceshis movements to a rhythm ; he grasps each piece of material in the same way , delivering his strokes upon it in such a way as never to throw away his energy . Every one knows how much better results a trained oarsman secures from the expenditure of a given amount of muscular energy than the raw beginner , who puts forth his strength now on the water , now on the air , now in the right direction , now in the wrong one . The difference in effectiveness between the strokes delivered by the man who works with a single tool , and the strokes delivered by one who works with a dozen tools , is hardly exaggerated by the comparison . The best workman loses some time in changing from tool to tool . It is not difficult to find a carpenter who spends many fruitless moments searching now for his saw , now for his hammer , while the whereabouts of the plane or square , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not insolvable , problem . And this is the man who leaves his work with the loudest complaints of his weariness . A division of labor that holds a man so strictly to business that he never has a chance to stop to search for anything , contributes materially to reduce such waste of time and energy . The simplification of the task of each laborer makes it a comparatively easy matter to ascertain how much any particular one is actually doing . One who has lived in the country has probably made the acquaintance of two types of laborers : the first , those who are always bustling about in a hurry and yet accomplishing little ; the second , never in a hurry , yet showing , in the end , a good record of // achievement . Because of the miscellaneous character of the work of the agricultural laborer , it takes a long time to measure the relative efficiency of different men . Where a man is compelled to repeat the same operation throughout the day , no show of bustling energy will create the illusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted to give an accurate idea of the laborer 's efficiency . It is obvious , then , that the difficulty of supervision is greatly reduced by systematic division of labor . 9 . From a social point of view , the principal advantages of division of labor are : ( 1 ) that it affords a place of usefulness to many who would otherwise be of little use to society ; ( 2 ) that it permits each to put his abilities to the best account ; and ( 3 ) that it facilitates mechanical progress . Under frontier conditions , where each man must perform a wide variety of functions , some prove utter failures , wasting so much time turning irresolutely from task to task that they accomplish nothing . These same men might prove highly efficient workmen under different industrial conditions . If our frontier communities had kept detailed records , we should find that they contained many a man who would have made a good architect or engineer , many a woman who would have made an excellent modiste or teacher , but who proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Architecture and engineering , designing of costumes and teaching of children , were indeed functions not wholly neglected , but they made up a very small part in the life of each family and gave little opportunity to any one for the full development of his natural talents . Division of labor makes it possible for persons who have not the time or the versatility to learn how to perform a variety of functions to attain to a place of usefulness in industry . There are many persons who can not afford the time to learn the tailor 's trade ; many who have the time // for apprenticeship , but not the general ability required for the making of a well-fitting coat . Few persons are so stupid that they can not , with slight waste of time , learn how to sew a straight seam . If the work of making a coat is distributed among a dozen persons , each one can quickly learn to do well his particular part . Further , in the distribution of the work , each one may be given a task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste his time picking basting threads , and the person for whom the latter function is a sufficient profession , will be kept from spoiling material through attempting something more ambitious . Perhaps the greatest advantage that arises from division of labor is the stimulus it gives to the invention of laborsaving machinery . A hundred years ago it would have seemed quite impossible to manufacture shoes largely by machinery . The process of manufacture appeared so complicated that hand labor alone would answer . To-day shoes are largely the product of machines . Many forces cooperated , of course , to bring about this result , but only one of these concerns us here , the division of labor . When a complicated operation like the making of a shoe is split up into several score of simpler operations , some of these are likely to prove so nearly mechanical that the idea of machines to take over the work suggests itself . If the process of production is divided into twenty-five parts , perhaps the third , and eleventh , and seventeenth are taken over by machines . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; additional ones prove to be fitted for machine work , and thus more of the hand-workers are displaced . It is conceivable that in the end practically the whole process might be taken over by machines , while the hand-worker might be transformed into an attendant of the machine , so to speak , feeding it with material , and passing on the product to another machine . // 10 . From a social point of view the division of labor is attended by serious drawbacks . The division of labor greatly increases the productive efficiency of the social working force , and this is from every point of view an advantage . It makes possible the utilization of many forms of labor that would otherwise find no place in the productive organization . This is an advantage when the form of labor utilized is incapable of development , as in the case of adults below the average in strength or in intelligence . Persons who would have to starve or beg under a system of complicated employments are often able to earn a fair living under a system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor , and the accompanying development of machinery , give inducement to the employment of classes that should not be employed at steady and monotonous labor . Small children and persons failing in health are drawn into the circle of sustained labor . The former should be allowed to develop their faculties in a natural way ; the latter , to recover their health . When each employment required all the faculties of a normal man , there was nothing to tempt producers to employ laborers of this class . Since the introduction of division of labor , the evil of employing those who should not be employed has assumed serious proportions . Legislation has been invoked to limit the employment of children , but in few countries has child labor been subjected to wholly satisfactory regulation . Another serious disadvantage of the division of labor is that it tends to reduce the pleasure men derive from their work . The artisan who produces a completed piece of work usually takes an active interest in it . The carpenter takes pride in the houses he has built ; the cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . It is a common thing to find men belonging to these trades ? // representatives of the earlier order ? reluctantly leaving their work when the whistle blows or the foreman shouts " Time up . " Not so with the workman whose day is spent in performing some minute part of the work of producing each one of a multitude of like commodities . His part in production is merged with that of his numerous fellows . He may , while young and enthusiastic , take pride in the achievements of the establishment where he is employed ; but for the most part , his interest in the work is dependent on his prospect of receiving increased pay . A further disadvantage of division of labor is that it renders the workman dependent on a certain kind of work , and therefore exposes him to the risk of non-employment when supplies of material are wanting or when markets fail . There are in most modern countries many men and women who are well-trained textile workers , but who do not know how to find other employment when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher the degree of specialization , the more serious are the effects of changes in industrial conditions . 11 . Progress in the specialization of economic functions is subject to a law of diminishing returns . We may now consider how far the principle of division of labor modifies the operation of the principle of diminishing returns , described in the last chapter . According to the latter principle , an increase in the amount of labor employed in connection with a limited amount of capital gives a return which is not proportionate with the increase in labor . But what if the additional laborers give opportunity for division of labor which had not before existed ? Suppose that a tailor 's shop with a capital of $20,000 formerly employed six men ; it now employs twelve men . Division of labor can be carried farther with twelve men ; hence is it not possible that the employment of the second six men will double the output of the shop ? This is quite // possible . An additional six men will give occasion to still more systematic division of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each man . And so with a fourth set of six men . But it is evident that one can not go on indefinitely subdividing the work of making a coat . Eventually a point will be reached where further subdivision of labor increases the efficiency of each laborer only slightly ; still further subdivision , even less ; finally a degree of subdivision will be found that will not pay . That is , the principle of division of labor is itself subject to diminishing returns . A practical illustration of this fact is to be found in the organization of the working force in many large establishments where much use is made of division of labor . The making of a complete article is not assigned to a single man ; nor is it assigned ? to all the men in the shop . Each article is assigned to a " team , " among the members of which the successive manipulations of the material are distributed . The entire working force may contain scores of teams . Now , the size of each team indicates the limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each team to sixty men , this is proof that in his opinion a team of seventy men would not show so large a product per man . We may grant that an increase in laborers employed in connection with a given capital may possibly result in an increase in product more than proportionate to the increase in labor . This may hold true until the number of laborers is sufficient to compose a team of maximum efficiency . If an additional team is engaged , without increase in capital , it is doubtful if returns will increase in proportion to the number of teams ; a third team will show a return less than that of the second , and so on until the point is reached where it does not pay to employ an additional team . So far as the principle of division of labor is concerned , then , the only qualification to be made in the Ito INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS law of diminishing returns is that when we assume that labor increases , we must assume that it increases by teams , not by individual men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution , one after another of ? the functions of the primitive family group has been taken over by persons who make a specialty of it . The development of exchange has been a condition and a cause of- the tendency toward specialization . The differentiation of economic functions may rest with the assignment to each individual of a particular trade , or it may be carried so far as to subdivide the work of a single trade . In the former case we have what is known as differentiation of occupations ; in the latter , division of labor . A high degree of division of labor presupposes a well developed commercial organization . Lnprovements in transportation increase the number of fields in which the principle may operate , as does also increase in the density of population . In a society in which production is carried on by employer-capitalists with hired factory workers division of labor can be carried much farther than in a society in which the laborer works on his own account . The productive power of society has been greatly increased by differentiation of functions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find work commensurate with his capacity , and facilitates mechanical progress . On the other hand , it encourages employers to substitute child labor for the labor of men , and it destroys , in large measure , the pleasure that men find in their work . Up to a certain point progress in the division of labor neutralizes the effect of diminishing returns . But division of labor is itself subject to diminishing returns ; the earlier stages in the process are more fruitful than the later ones . CHAPTER VIII THE CONCENTRATION OF INDUSTRY 1 . The average size of the business establishment is steadily increasing . It is a matter of common observation that to launch a business to-day a larger capital is required than was the case a generation ago . An examination of the census statistics of manufactures shows us how strongly marked this tendency toward larger establishments has become . From 188o to 1905 the number of establishments making agricultural implements decreased from 1943 to 648 , while the aggregate capital of the industry increased from $62,000,000 to $196,000,000 . The following table illustrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other industries , while the number of establishments increased during this period , the capital increased far more rapidly . The number of establishments making cotton goods increased from 1005 to 1154 , but the capital increased from $ 219,000,000 to $ 613,000,000 . Silk manufacturing establishments increased from 382 to 624 ; their aggregate capital increased from x$19,000,000 to $109,000,000 . There 121 // is hardly a single branch of manufacture in which the average establishment has not increased in size very markedly . The same thing is true even in greater degree in the business of transportation , both by rail and by water . In retail and wholesale trade , in banking , and in insurance , we find the same general tendency toward an enlarging business unit . The present may therefore justly be characterized as an era of business concentration . In order to understand this tendency , we must acquaint ourselves ( r ) with the external conditions making large scale business possible , and ( 2 ) with the advantages that enable the large business enterprise to prevail in competition with the smaller one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the facilities for assembling raw material . Among the industries showing least tendency toward increase in the size of the individual establishment is that of canning and preserving fruits and vegetables . In r88o the average capital of an establishment engaged in this industry was $20,000 ; in 1905 it was $21,000 . A cannery must depend for its material upon the products of a relatively small area , since fresh fruits and vegetables can not be carried far without deterioration , except at great expense for packing and icing . The size of an establishment for the making of butter and cheese suffers under the same limitations . The same thing was formerly true of the slaughtering of cattle and swine ; but in these industries a radical change has occurred in recent years . For an analogous reason no marked tendency toward concentration has appeared in agriculture . In that industry , an important element in success consists in keeping the dwelling place of the laborers so near to the fields that no great amount of time is wasted in going to and from the work . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to the fields to obviate excessively long // haulage of the products . It follows , then , that the number of acres that may be managed from a common center is somewhat narrowly limited . An apparent exception to this rule is to be found in the great wheat farms of California , the Dakotas , and the Canadian Northwest . Here the land is level and free from stones and stumps of trees ; the natural fertility is great , and evenly distributed over large areas . Cultivation consists simply in plowing , sowing , and harvesting , and this can be done by aid of the highest type of agricultural machinery . As sQon as the natural fertility of the soil is exhausted , however , a more intensive tillage will be necessary ; fertilizers will have to be applied ; rotation of crops will succeed continuous wheat-cropping . For such tillage the immense unbroken fields are not well adapted . The " bonanza " farm is a transient as well as an exceptional phenomenon . 3 . The size of the business unit is further dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so rapidly that they can not be produced in large masses and distributed over wide areas . Bakers ' bread will serve as an example of this type of commodity . It would be useless to erect a bakery so large that it could not find a sufficient market for its wares within easy delivery distance . The production of many kinds of fresh fruits and vegetables is similarly dependent on a local clientele for a market , and the size of the establishment is limited accordingly . Some products are limited to a narrow local market because they are too bulky to justify transportation over long distances . Common bricks and firewood fall in this class . In both classes , the denser the population , the larger the business establishment that can be successfully operated . 4 . Every improvement in transportation and reduction of charges makes possible an increase in the size of the average business establishment . // Reduction in the charges for carrying wheat and flour , both by rail and by water , have resulted in an extraordinary concentration of the business of grinding grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capital of $7250 ; in 1905 , the average capital was $26,500 . In Minnesota , the chief center of the industry , the average capital is nearly $ oo , 000 . Low rates on stock cars , and the development of the refrigerator car and refrigerator storage on shipboard , have made possible the centralization of the slaughtering business . Reductions in the rates on furniture have enabled Michigan furniture makers to send their goods to the most distant parts of the United States . There is scarcely a single manufacturing enterprise in the United States which has not been brought within reach of a wider market by the recent progress in transportation . Mercantile establishments find their sphere enlarged in similar manner . Rapid transit for passengers , and the advent of the motor delivery wagon , have enabled many retail stores to expand far beyond the requirements of the territory they originally served . The adoption by the United States of a parcels post system similar to that of European countries , would enable many " mail order " stores to extend their business much beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by individual enterprisers , business concentration depends upon the concentration of wealth . Before the middle of the nineteenth century the typical business enterprise , both in the United States and in foreign countries , was owned by a single individual or by a partnership consisting of a small number of individuals . Large scale enterprise , then , was possible only where comparatively few had gained possession of large fortunes . In countries where there was little inequality in wealth , // as in France , the concentration of business could not be so marked as in countries where inequalities were greater , as in England . In the newer and more democratic parts of the United States , enterprise was conducted on a smaller scale than in the older parts , where wealth had been accumulated in fewer hands . 6 . The corporate form of business organization makes possible a higher degree of concentration than is possible ' under a system of individual enterprise . A business corporation , or joint stock company , is an association of individuals authorized by government to carry on an enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is the right to be treated in law as a single person . Members of the association are such by virtue of ownership of shares or stock in the corporation . In the simplest form of corporation all shares of stock represent equal shares in the control of the corporation and equal claims upon its profits . The stockholders elect a board of directors and other important officers ; employees of minor rank are usually appointed by the president , or by the president and directors . All business of the corporation is carried on by its officers and employees ; shareholders , as such , can not engage in business in the name of the corporation . When a member of a non-corporate business association , or partnership , dies or withdraws from the business , it is necessary to wind up the affairs of the association . When a holder of stock in a corporation dies , his shares descend to his heirs , like any other personal property ; when he wishes to withdraw from the corporation , he merely sells his shares . Changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corporation . Therein lies the great superiority of the corporation over partnership associations . The former , when not limited by law , has perpetual life , and can therefore undertake // policies looking to distant gains ; the partnership , on the other hand , is subject to dissolution at any time , and is therefore unsuited to large and permanent enterprises . Wherever the corporate form of organization is well established , large enterprises become possible even in communities where there are no individuals possessing great wealth . A steel plant requiring an investment of $6,000,000 may be erected in a city where no man has more than $Io , 000 to invest . Capital secured from a thousand different persons thus acquires the same effectiveness as a vast capital owned by a single individual . The corporate form of organization is to-day the prevailing form in the United States . Corporations produced 73.7 per cent of the manufactures of the United States in the year 1905 . Individual and partnership enterprises were indeed far more numerous than corporations , representing 74.9 per cent of all enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , small ones , and are of dwindling importance in the nation 's industry . Having gained an insight into the conditions under which business concentration is possible , we may proceed to a consideration of the advantages which the large establishment enjoys . 7 . The large establishment can make the most extensive use of the principle of division of labor . As we saw in the last chapter , manifold advantages spring from the division of labor . The establishment to be launched must be at least large enough to make the fullest practicable use of this principle . Perhaps this end would be attained , so far as the working force directly engaged in the process of manufacture is concerned , in an establishment with a capital of $1oo,000 and with Too laborers . A second loo laborers , supplied with an equal amount of capital , might double the output , but they would not increase the efficiency of the first hundred men . // So with a third and fourth hundred men . No further economy in concentration arises under this head . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " office " force ; possibly it may have buying agents , who travel long distances in search of the various materials , and selling agents , likewise compelled to travel about in search of buyers . A small establishment could support only a small number of employees of these classes ; there could be no extended division of labor among them . An establishment of larger size might be able to assign one man exclusively to the purchase of one kind of material , another to the purchase of another kind , and so enjoy the advantages of specialized skill . Similar division of labor might be effected among the selling agents and among the members of the office force . In this way a very large establishment could assure itself that every commercial situation arising would receive expert attention . There is , of course , no theoretical limit to the possible gains from this source . An establishment might be so large that it could have a man devoting his full time to the purchase of machine oil for its use , and something would doubtless be gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life such trifling gains would have little effect in determining the size of an establishment . They are too small to make a perceptible addition to dividends . 8 . In the large establishment it is possible to make use of the most perfect mechanical equipment . The process of manufacture may involve a score or more of manipulations of the material , and at each stage several machines may be drawn into use . A number of different types of machinery are on the market , some performing the function required with greater celerity and certainty than others . The better machines , naturally , represent a larger investment . To equip a factory throughout // with the best machinery would require a large capital , even if the process could be reduced to a series of steps occupying one set of machines as long as another . Such a division of the process is not ordinarily practicable ; some machines contribute only very slight changes in the material , delaying it but a moment as it passes through , while other machines subject the material to more important changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the machines may all be used to their full capacity , there must be a number of machines engaged in the slower parts of the process to one engaged in the part which can be performed quickly . And this involves a still further increase in the capital of the establishment . In most industries , the general progress of invention is in the direction of more costly machines , and this is one of the more important reasons for the trend toward industrial concentration . At a particular time , however , there is a theoretical size of business which permits full equipment with the best machines then available . An increase in the establishment beyond this point brings no advantage in the direct process of manufacture . There may , however , be other important advantages to be gained through such enlargement of plant . 9 . The large establishment enjoys the advantage of cheap power . The providing of power , in most manufacturing industries , is one of the most important of technical problems , and here the large establishment usually has decided advantages . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can power be furnished . There is not so much heat wasted in a large furnace as in a small one ; a large power plant can be so arranged as to prevent much of the waste of power in transmission that usually takes place in a small establishment . Here it would be difficult to find a theoretical limit to the advantages that follow from an in THE // crease in size of plant . In practice , however , the economies to be gained in this way are not very important after a moderate size of plant has been reached . We do not find men constructing huge factories merely to obtain the advantages of cheaper power , although these advantages may not be entirely neglected in determining the size of a business to be established . 10 . The large establishment wastes less material than the small one . In the early history of the American iron industry the waste of fuel and metal was enormous . Present-day iron ' manufacturers find it worth while to resmelt the masses of slag left as worthless by the early smelters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced by over fifty per cent the amount of fuel necessary to produce a ton of pig iron . The wastefulness of small scale industry is strikingly illustrated in gold production . In one gold mining district of Mexico it is estimated that $ 120,000,000 worth of metal has gone down into the streams in the mud and sand from which the gold is washed . Modern large-scale methods would have recovered practically all of this gold . Furthermore , much material which would be absolutely useless to the small producer is made to yield a profit to the large enterprise which is adequately provided with equipment . On the Snake River in Oregon are large deposits of gold-bearing gravel , but the amount of gold contained in the gravel ? about twenty cents per cubic yard ? would not pay the small producer for the trouble of getting it . A gold-dredging enterprise has secured an enormous profit ? in one year , 128 per cent on its capital ? from this gold deposit . 11 . The large enterprise can often utilize , for byproducts , what the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material undergoes some shrinkage in the process of manufacture , through the // removal of parts not fitted to enter into the main product . These parts are waste in a small establishment , and the problem of getting rid of them is often a serious one . In the large establishment they accumulate in enormous quantities , and the question whether they could not be utilized in some way readily suggests itself . Through successive experiments , one element after another ceases to figure as waste , and is transformed into a by-product . Thus forty years ago much of the residue of the small oil refineries was allowed to flow away in the streams . The same material to-day is the basis of scores of by-products , the value of which is an important element in the profits of the petroleum industry . Compare the methods of waste disposal of the small butcher shops of to-day with those of the great packing houses . To the former from forty to sixty per cent of every animal slaughtered is sheer waste , to be got rid of in whatever way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large establishment is transformed into over a hundred by-products , practically no part of it being considered wholly valueless . Such utilization of waste requires the investment of a considerable capital in various kinds of appliances and the employment of a large body of laborers who have nothing to do with the main product . Some of the by-products take from the mass of waste only insignificant elements ; hence their utilization is possible only when waste accumulates in enormous quantities . It is obvious that only a very large establishment can carry on a thoroughly systematic plan of developing by-products . An establishment large enough to enjoy all the advantages of division of labor and of costly machinery may not be one tenth large enough to gain all the profits of waste utilization . 12 . The large establishment can secure materials at lower prices , and sell its products at higher prices , than is possible for the small establishment . // It has already been pointed out that an important advantage of the large establishment is the possibility of organizing its buying and selling agents in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transaction . A further commercial advantage consists in the fact that purchases can be made on a large scale , and therefore , generally , on especially favorable terms . The dealer in raw material can afford to sell at an unusually low price to a customer whose purchases may mount up into millions . The same - thing is true of all other dealers who supply the large establishment . There may , indeed , be a combination among such dealers , fixing the margin of profit at which each must sell ; but such a combination can do little toward extorting high profits from an enterpriser who can , if he chooses , dispense with the middleman altogether , and deal directly with the producer of , the materials . The maker of machinery is likewise compelled to content himself with a small profit when dealing with a concern which has capital and enterprise enough to make its own machinery , if it finds a profit in so doing . In its sales , the large establishment enjoys similar advantages . It can provide each purchaser with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the product is to be exported , the large establishment can afford to send agents to foreign countries to find out what qualities are desired , and in what form the product will be most acceptable to the foreign taste . The large enterpriser , further , can make a more systematic study of the market than can the smaller one , and so can make his purchases and sales when the markets are most favorable. 13 . The large establishment often enjoys exceptionally low rates on its shipments . Since the large enterprise commonly secures its supplies , and ships its products , in large quantities , it can more // frequently avail itself of the low rates on carload lots than can its smaller competitors . More important still , it can often force railway and steamship companies to discriminate in its favor in fixing charges . Formerly this was done openly . When laws were passed forbidding discriminating rates , the large enterprise was given secret rebates , which often represented a very material reduction in rates . This practice , it is believed , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether this is true or not , there can be little doubt that in the past railway discriminations have played an important part in hastening the concentration of industry . 14 . The large enterprise usually pays a lower rate of interest on loans than the small enterprise . No matter how large the capital of an enterprise may be , there will at times be need of borrowing money . At a particular time the market for materials may be so favorable that it will be profitable to purchase large supplies beyond current needs . An active business will not have on hand any large amount of idle cash ; hence the necessity for borrowing . As a rule , bankers lend money at a lower interest rate to a large enterpriser than to a small one . The principal reason why they do this is that the large establishment appears to offer better security than the small one . 15 . The advantages of business concentration vary in their nature from industry to industry . The foregoing is of course very far from an exhaustive statement of the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other advantages will readily occur to any one who observes the economic development of the locality in which he lives . It will be observed that some of the advantages are prominent in one industry , some in another . In the manufacture of cotton cloth , for example , there are no important byTHE // products to be utilized . The market for ordinary grades of cloth is well developed ; the jobber takes the product from the manufacturer 's hands and disposes of it to the retailer , charging a commission so low that it would hardly pay the manufacturer to develop selling agencies of his own . Neither the material nor the product is very bulky , in comparison with its value ; hence the advantages en joyed by the large concern in the matter of freight trans portation are not likely to be of very great importance . To equip a mill thoroughly with the best machinery in the market does not require a very large capital ; nor does an establishment have to be very large to enjoy to the full the advantages of division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in this industry ; but they are not so important that they may not be counterbalanced by slightly better management on the part of the smaller establishment . I R ' In the iron and steel industries ; on the other hand , a complete equipment of machinery is usually very costly . A large capital is required to keep every important machine in constant use . The transportation of materials and products is expensive , and a great part of the profit of an establishment may depend upon the kind of contract that can be made with the transportation companies . By-products are not very important , but the larger establish ment can secure large economies through making the best use of its material . Fuel is of course an immensely important item in the industry , and decided advantages are to be obtained through purchases on a large scale . Furthermore , the larger the establishment the greater the economy possible in the use of the fuel . Accordingly , in this industry a very large plant will have substantial advantages over one of moderate size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of machinery is concerned , there is no important advantage enjoyed by the very large // plant of which a plant of moderate size could not avail itself . Economy of fuel is another minor consideration in this industry . The important advantages of the large plant consist in more systematic division of labor , better utilization of by-products , better conditions of transportation , and more effective advertising . In the refining of petroleum almost every form of advantage that has been mentioned favors the large establishment . It is not to be inferred that the advantages of the large establishment are confined to manufacturing industry . Mercantile business shows much the same tendency toward concentration . In the retail trade , the large establishment enjoys great advantages in the purchase and sale of goods ; it not only buys more cheaply , but it is better able to cater to the tastes of its customers than the small store . It can afford a style of advertising that reaches the public , while the small establishment is likely to throw away the money it spends in advertising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospective customer . 16 . The gains from concentration are , subject to a law of diminishing returns . Theoretically it is difficult to establish a point beyond which further enlargement of a business establishment would be unprofitable . Every enlargement of a petroleum refinery , for example , makes possible some new economies . After a certain size has been reached , however , an establishment is able to enjoy most of the known advantages of large scale production . In some industries , this involves an investment of $500,000 ; in other industries , perhaps , of $50,000,000 . A capital of such size the enterpriser will vigorously strive to bring together . A profitable business may perhaps be conducted with , a much smaller capital ; but it will be more and more seriously handicapped as time passes , and the average size of new competing establishments increases . // There is of course no reason why an establishment should not be much larger than is necessary to obtain practically all the benefits of large scale production known at the time . Say that a $2,000,000 plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $4,000,000 or a $6,000,00o plant should not be established . But capital can not be got together without effort ; and unless substantial advantages are to be gained through the larger investment , the enterpriseV is likely to rest content with the smaller one . As we have seen , the expansion of businesses already established , in whatever branch of industry , is confined to narrow limits by the law of diminishing returns . There is a similar law which confines within narrow limits the size of a new enterprise in an industry dependent upon local supplies of material , or a local market for its products . With such enterprises , a point is reached where increasing business is attended by increasing cost , transportation generally representing the expanding element in cost . Finally , we have the new enterprises in industries which are . practically independent of local supplies of material and of the local demand for products . In these enterprises we may assume that no element in production is as yet fixed . They may , within limits , assume such magnitude as will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These economies have a determining importance in the choice between a small business and one of moderate size ; they are of less importance in the choice between an establishment of moderate size and a large one ; with further increase in size of establishment their importance dwindles . Perhaps there is no point at which further economies cease ; but there is a point at which they cease to be of practical importance . In economic language , the economies from concentration of industry are subject to a law of diminishing returns . // 17 . Summary . Concentration , or increase in size of the business establishment , is a characteristic of the existing stage of economic development . A partial explanation of concentration is to be found in improvements in transportation , which make possible the assembling of raw material and the marketing of finished products . A prerequisite of concentration is the control of great wealth by single enterprisers . Such control may result either from the growth of large fortunes or from the adoption of the corporate form of business organization . The advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of labor ; ( z ) better mechanical equipment ; ( 3 ) cheaper power ; ( 4 ) utilization of waste ; ( 5 ) lower prices for materials and higher prices for finished products ; ( 6 ) lower charges for transportation ; ( 7 ) lower interest rates . All these advantages are subject to a law of diminishing returns . CHAPTER IX BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 1 . In many branches of trade and industry the several establishments are forming combinations that limit in greater or less degree the independence of action of each one . In the last chapter we saw that the average industrial establishment is steadily increasing in size . In some industries concentration has already gone so far that a small number of establishments control the greater part of the output . A movement that is even more striking than the concentration of industry is the formation of combinations among the enterprisers controlling an industry . This movement is , in part , a direct result of concentration . When the number of producers becomes small , it is relatively a simple matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination is , however , not a necessary result of concentration ; we may therefore best treat the two movements separately . Combinations are most frequent in the fields of transportation and manufacture . Most of the railways of the country are combined in a few great systems ; most of the manufacture of steel is controlled by half a dozen great combinations , and the same thing is true of illuminating oil , tin plate , sugar , and a great variety of other industries . The production of copper and'the smelting of silver and gold-bearing ores is largely controlled by combinations . A combination of great capitalists controls the mining of anthracite coal ; in some parts of the country the mining of bituminous coal has fallen under the domination of combinations . Indeed , we may say that the tendency toward =37 // combination manifests itself in practically every branch of economic life . 2 . Combination may take the form of a union of producers that , as independent units , would be in active competition with one another . The combinations that first attracted serious attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway transportation . Two roads , uniting the same terminals , instead of competing recklessly for business , often formed agreements dividing the traffic on what appeared to them an equitable basis . In most of the early industrial combinations , the members forming the union were engaged in the same stage of the process of production , and hence were active competitors until the combination was formed . Such were the steel rail , the tin plate , and the wire nail combinations in the iron and steel industries . Similar combinations have existed among the paper manufacturers , the smelters of the more valuable metals , the distillers , and the binding twine manufacturers . It is associations of this kind that are commonly designated by-the term combination . 3 . Combination may assume the form of a union between establishments engaged in different stages in the process of producing and marketing a commodity . One of the earlier phases in economic development was the distribution of the various stages in the production of a commodity among a number of industries or sub-industries . The manufacture of woolen cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carding and spinning , weaving , fulling , dyeing . The distribution of the product to the various consuming centers gave rise to another independent line of business , the wholesale trade . The work of placing the finished product in the hands of the consumer was taken over by another business , the retail trade . In recent years an opposing tendency has made its // appearance . The entire work of preparing and distributing a commodity is , in many cases , undertaken in a combination of establishments representing a single enterprise . One company mines coal and iron ore , transports these materials in its own ships and over its own railways , transforms the materials into pig iron for use in its own steel plant , and sells the finished product ? rails , structural material , etc. ? directly to the final purchaser . There are furniture makers that advertise the fact that every stage in the process of production , from the felling of the tree to delivery at the customer 's door , is under their control . Shoe manufacturers own the tanneries that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place the product before the consumers . This uniting of all the stages in the process of production in one combined enterprise is known as the integration of industry . Integration and combination in the restricted sense often go hand in hand . The United States Steel Corporation is a combination of producers in the final stage in production , as well as a combination of producers in different stages of the process . 4 . Some combinations are temporary in their nature . Even in an industry which is apparently so unfavorable to combination as agriculture , temporary combination is becoming fairly common . Farmers often combine for the purchase of machinery , seed , or other supplies , or for the shipment of their products to distant markets . Similarly , petty retailers combine in the purchase of goods from the manufacturers , thereby gaining the benefits of purchasing in large quantities . A number of newspapers often unite in sending a correspondent to a war or other center of popular attention . Groups of financiers often form combinations , known as " syndicates , " to subscribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one . Combination of the nature here described is often termed business zoo INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS cooperation . It is to be carefully distinguished from labor cooperation , a system under which the laborers seek to rid themselves of the control of an employer . Another form of temporary combination has for its purpose common action in fixing prices . In the year 1908 there was a widespread combination among cotton producers with the object of holding their cotton for a fixed price . Competing railways frequently agree upon charges for a limited period of time . Groups of speculators often combine to force up the prices of commodities or securities over which they hold a temporary control . 5 . Some combinations , though permanent in nature , include in their scope only a small part of the activities of their several members . In many parts of the country the growers of fruit have formed associations for the purpose of controlling the marketing of products . In his business as a fruit grower , each member of the combination is entirely independent ; each member endeavors to excel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of the exactions of the transportation companies and the commission merchants has led to united action in the marketing of products . Some of the larger associations have agents who visit all the important consuming centers and make the most favorable terms with the merchants who deal with the consumer . They also have agents whose duty it is to watch over the movement of cars bearing the products of the association , and to take note of the condition of the products at the time of delivery . In some countries dairymen and poultry producers have organized similar associations . Most of the newspapers of the country are combined for the purpose of gathering news . This work has become so complex that a paper which can not avail itself of the Associated Press dispatches has little chance of survival . In every large city the banks maintain a clearing house , // where the claims of the various banks upon one another are settled . So important is this function of settlement that a bank which is excluded from the clearing house is seriously handicapped in its business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting independ-ently in the domestic market , maintain common agencies to handle the export trade . In many cases in American industrial history attempts have been made to control by combination the aggregate output of an industry , and so to fix prices . The several enterprises were left free to pursue their own policies in matters of production ; in matters pertaining to the mar-keting of products they were subject to the control of the combination . This form we shall consider further in a later section . A combination may merge the several establishments into a single enterprise . This form of combination is known as a consolidation . In the great industrial enterprises of to-day , such as the United States Steel Corporation , the Standard Oil Company , and the American Sugar Refining Company , the separate establishments have completely surrendered their independence of action . Each establishment has its own officers , but these are chosen by the combination , or " parent " corporation , which thus determines their policy in every important respect . Several hundred combina-tions of this nature have been organized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many persons believe that the days of individual enterprise in the field of industry are numbered . The earliest effective form of permanent combination for purposes of price control was the " pool , " an agreement distributing the amount of business to be done , or the receipts from the business , among the several enterprises . In the period following the Civil War competition be142 INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS came so keen in many lines of business as to force prices to the cost level , or even lower . This was especially the case in railway transportation . At first an attempt was made to maintain rates through formal agreements ; but each railway , in its zeal for increased business , was strongly impelled to cut rates in spite of its agreement to maintain them . Various devices were employed to restrain this tendency toward cutting rates . The most successful of these were the " pools . " A number of railways , competing for traffic between two centers , would agree upon a division of the traffic ( " traffic pools " ) or upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money pools " ) . Thus in 187o the three railways connecting Chicago and Omaha made an agreement by the terms of which each road was to accept whatever through business was offered , at a rate set by mutual agreement . Each road was to retain for itself 45 per cent of the earnings of the through passenger business and 5o per cent of the earnings of the through freight business . The remainder of the earnings was to be placed in a fund to be shared equally by the three companies . This arrangement remained in force for practically fourteen years ; it was finally destroyed by hostile legislation . A similar plan was adopted by the Bessemer Steel Pool in 1896 . Each mill was assigned a certain percentage of the total amount of steel that was to be produced by the association . If any mill exceeded its allotment , it was required to pay $2 a ton on the excess to the treasury of the association , and an equal sum was paid to those members of the association who fell short of their allotted output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more active producers , and prices were maintained at a decidedly profitable level . This pool , like the great majority that have been formed , was short-lived . Some of the more powerful members became dissatisfied with the percentage // of output allotted to them and withdrew , leaving the pool too weak to maintain prices . 8 . A stronger form of combination was created by ' placing a majority of the shares of stock in each constituent company permanently in the hands of trustees . This form of combination is known as the trust . In 1882 the stockholders of the leading petroleum refining corporations , which had for many years operated in harmony under informal agreements , placed a majority of their stocks in the hands of nine trustees . For the stock surrendered to the trustees , the owners received certificates entitling them to a share in the profits of the combination . The power to vote the stock was transferred irrevocably to the trustees , who were thus in a position to determine the policy of each company . This form of organization was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 189o , known generally as the Sherman Anti-Trust Law , the trust was made illegal , so far as it affected interstate commerce , and most of the states have passed laws prohibiting trusts . This form of combination , therefore , has been destroyed . 9 . A permanent combination may be established through the formation of a corporation for the purpose of securing control of a majority of the stock in each of the companies which it is sought to combine . Such a corporation is properly termed a holding company ; in popular speech it is called a " trust . " When the trust form of organization became outlawed , men who sought to attain the same end hit upon the device of organizing a corporation with power to purchase and hold the stocks of other companies . The laws of several states , especially those of New Jersey , are very favorable to this form of organization . Accordingly , when a group of powerful producers desire to form a permanent combination , they secure a charter , we will say from the II // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation with extensive powers , including the essential one of holding stocks in other companies . They then exchange their shares in the business corporations which they control for shares in the new company , and endeavor to induce other persons interested in the same industry to do likewise . Or the new corporation may place its shares on the market , and use the proceeds in the purchase of shares of producing companies . In this way it is possible to bring a large part of an industry under a single control . The process of thus merging a number of enterprises into one is known as " consolidation . " The so-called trusts of to-day are organized in the way described above . In some cases the holding company , instead of buying shares in a producing company , buys its plant outright . In many cases it fails to secure a majority of the stock in such a company , but secures a sufficiently large minority of stock to make its influence decidedly felt . 10 . Consolidation increases the productive cfciency of the several establishments . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of each to retain exclusive possession of such improvements in methods as it may succeed in making . If an improvement consists in a mechanical invention that can be patented , the establishment which secures it is protected in its monopoly by the law . It is conceivable that each one of a score of competing companies may thus retain exclusive possession of a device that the others could use to advantage . Consolidation permits each company to make use of all the patented devices originating in the establishments of the other companies . The United States Steel Corporation is at present erecting , at Gary , Indiana , a steel-making plant which is to embody every idea that has proved profitable in any of the plants of the company . It is anticipated that steel will // be manufactured more cheaply at the Gary plant than is possible in any existing steel works . No company not having the combined experience of the Steel Corporation could hope to establish a plant of equal efficiency . The manager of one out of a number of competing establishments knows only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One establishment may produce steel at slightly less cost than another , without attracting special attention . When one plant in a great combination shows a lower cost per unit of output than do the others , the fact is at once known to the officers of the combination , who naturally seek to learn the causes of this superior efficiency , in order to introduce improvements in the establishments of less efficiency . Thus in a consolidated enterprise there is a resistless tendency to force every establishment to keep pace with the one which displays the greatest efficiency . 11 . Consolidation encourages a higher degree of specialization in production than does the system of competitive enterprise . An independent establishment , in order to retain its customers , is often compelled to cover a comparatively wide range of production . This involves keeping on hand a large amount of machinery which can be used only for a small part of the time . It also involves , in many cases , the production of goods for which the supplies of material upon which it relies are not especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those plants which are in the best position to execute them promptly and efficiently . 12 . Consolidation makes possible the supplying of each customer from the plant nearest to him , and thus reduces cost of shipment . Where an industry is competitively organized , there is a tendency for each producer to invade the territory nat146 INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS urally belonging to his competitors . Castings for use in Alabama should naturally be made in Alabama ; castings for use in the Pittsburg district should naturally be made there . But if there is competition between makers of castings in the two centers , some of the products of Pittsburg will be sent to Alabama , and vice versa . This is sheer waste , and consolidation puts a stop to it , to the advantage of the producer and of society as well . It is true that under the competitive regime informal agreements among producers to respect one another 's territory kept this form of waste within bounds . But there was always disputed territory , in which freights were uselessly carried back and forth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real differences in quality make supplying from a distant mill necessary , or where the nearest mill is temporarily overwhelmed with orders . 13 . Consolidation reduces the chances of loss from oversupply or undersupply of the market . When an industry is carried on by a large number of competing employers , each one is in greater or less uncertainty as to whether he can market his products at remunerative prices . The causes for uncertainty are first , possible changes in the demand , over which the industry has no control , and second , changes in the combined output of the competing establishments . When a consolidation is formed , the second of these causes is eliminated . The producer knows exactly how great a volume will be placed upon the market . There is consequently less chance that great stocks will accumulate at a time when the demand is slack . When the volume of orders increases , the full extent of the increase is readily calculated , and preparations may be made for a correspondingly greater output , if an industry is consolidated . If an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // an increased volume of orders , is uncertain whether the expansion of the business is general or not , and so delays preparations for increase of output , with the result that at the height of business expansion he must turn away orders at profitable prices . Herein lies one of the chief advantages of the form of consolidation which we have described as industrial integration . When the steel industry was competitively organized , there was at one time overproduction of ore , at another time overproduction of pig iron , at still another time overproduction of steel billets , even when there was no overproduction in the final stages of the industry . Under present circumstances all stages in the industry keep pace with one another . If the demand for finished products appears to be on the increase , a symmetrical increase is ordered in the production of ore , pig iron , crude steel , and finished products . 14 . Consolidation reduces the expenses incidental to the marketing of products . The marketing of products is , in many lines of industry , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the services of trained salesmen . A manufacturer must often make special concessions in prices or in conditions of payment in order to introduce his goods ; under competition he is always in danger of losing custom because of the efforts of his rivals to introduce their goods . Some efforts are of course necessary under the most favorable conditions to attract the attention of purchasers . But it is manifestly a more difficult problem to attract the attention of purchasers away from a rival 's wares than to attract their attention to the general class of goods . Consolidation results in important economies in this respect . The Distilling Company of America is said to have saved $ i , 000,000 a year through reduction in the number of traveling salesmen , made possible by combination . In many // cases consolidated companies have been able to dispense with the traveling salesman , since purchasers , having no choice , are compelled to resort directly to the producer . One of the more important sources of loss to the competitive producer was the failure of purchasers to pay for goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since by doing so he was likely to lose customers . The consolidated company can safely insist upon cash payment , since it has few competitors to take its customers away from it . 15 . The consolidation can usually borrow money on more favorable terms than any one of a number of competing producers . As a result of the manifold advantages of the consolidated company , the chances of its failure are reduced to a minimum . If it is conservatively , managed , loans made to it possess a high degree of security , and consequently bear a low rate of interest . Moreover , the mere fact that the consolidation represents a vast aggregate of capital places it in an extremely favorable position in the loan market . Every one has heard of the Standard Oil Company , the United States Steel Corporation , the Harvester Trust , the great packing companies . Every one has formed an estimate of the financial standing of these companies . Consequently the man who has loaned capital to one of these companies can easily sell his claim upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small refinery or slaughtering establishment may hold a position that is financially as sound as that of one of the great companies mentioned . But this fact is not generally known , and those who loan money to the lesser companies find far greater difficulty in disposing of their claims when they desire to do so . For this reason they demand a higher rate of interest than they would be willing to accept from the great consolidation . // 16 . The most important advantage arising from consolidation is the control over prices that it makes possible . All the advantages that have been enumerated would probably have been insufficient to cause an extensive movement in the direction of consolidation . Most of them could have been secured through a form of combination that would leave the independence of the individual establishment practically unimpaired . Combinations of independent establishments for purposes of price control are , under the American system , opposed to the spirit of the law , and for this reason could not be satisfactorily maintained . In Germany , where such combinations are recognized by law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have in America . It is still a disputed question whether consolidation has resulted generally in a material advance in prices . There are a number of cases in which it can readily be shown that these vast combinations have taken advantage of their monopolistic position to maintain prices at a level considerably above the competitive level . In other cases , consolidation appears rather to steady prices , preventing very low and very high prices , than to raise the average level . In any case , the rise in prices due to consolidations has been far less than a consideration of the monopoly position of these aggregations of capital would lead one to expect . The checks upon monopoly power , described in Chapter IV , appear therefore to be very effective . 17 . Summary . There is at present a tendency toward the formation of combinations of business establishments . The term combination is properly applied to unions between establishments in the same stage in the production of a commodity or service ; it is , however , also applied to unions of establishments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter form of combination is also termed 15o INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS industrial integration . Combinations may be temporary or permanent , partial or complete . The permanent and complete combination is known as a consolidation . The chief forms of combination have been the pool , the trust and the holding company . The pool and the trust have been outlawed ; existing combinations , commonly called " trusts , " are of the holding company type . The holding company is a corporation which holds the stock of companies that are consolidated , and so controls their policy . The advantages of consolidation are ( I ) the increased technical efficiency of each establishment , through application of methods developed in other establishments ; ( 2 ) greater opportunity for the specialization of each establishment to particular grades of the commodity produced ; ( 3 ) reduction in transportation charges ; ( 4 ) avoidance of oversupply and undersupply ; ( 5 ) reduction in cost of marketing ; ( 6 ) reduction in interest charges ; ( 7 ) control of prices . CHAPTER X COMPETITIVE WAGES 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth . We have found frequent occasion in earlier chapters to touch upon wages and interest . Wages and interest are parts of the cost of production of commodities , as we saw in Chapter V , and as such have an important part to play in determining values . In the present and the following chapters we shall endeavor to ascertain the laws determining the rates of wages , interest , and whatever other forms of social income may remain after the shares of the laborer and of the capitalist are paid . In other words , we are entering upon a study of the distribution of wealth , or , more properly , of the distribution of the social income . Every expenditure of human energy having for its chief purpose the production or the preservation of economic goods , or the increase in the valuable qualities of existing goods , is labor , in the economic sense of the term . Labor includes not only the exertions of the manual workers , by whom actual changes in material commodities are wrought , but also the exertions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manual tasks are performed . It includes the activities of police , of judge , and of legislature , upon whose efficient performance rest the possibility of continued production in most of the existing branches of industry . Labor does not include , however , efforts undertaken for their own sake , without regard to economic result . The amateur football team spends an immense amount of energy , and gets its reward in the 151 // spending . The amateur hunter often cares little or nothing for the birds he brings down ; his reward is the gratification of the prehistoric thirst for blood . The professional football player and the professional hunter , on the other hand , are laborers . If any one thinks that this is a distinction without a difference , let him ask the football amateur what claim to superiority he enjoys over the " professional " ; let him ask the sportsman wherein the latter differs from the pot-hunter. 2 . Wages are the income received on account of labor performed . As the term " wages " is generally used , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an employer to those who serve him in capacities of inferior dignity ; employees of higher rank receive " salaries . " Political economy does not recognize any such distinction as this , based as it is upon the pretended social status of the recipient , rather than upon a difference of economic function . The ten cents a day paid to a child slave and the $1oo,000 a year paid to the president of an insurance company are alike wages in the blunt speech of the economist . Moreover , in economic language , the term " wages " extends to part of the income of a workman who is his own employer . One peanut vender may be working for a push-cart enterpriser , receiving a dollar a day for his efforts . This sum , all will agree , is nothing but wages . At the opposite corner of the square you may find another peanut vender , who is his own employer . The latter may gain , over and above the cost of raw nuts , gasolene , push-cart hire , etc. , just a dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for identical services . Possibly the second vender calls his income " profits . " Political economy can not afford to use two different terms to designate essentially the same thing , especially when one of the terms , " profits , " has a very definite meaning of its own . Whatever a man receives // simply as a reward for his exertions , whether directly or through the intermediation of an employer , is wages . 3 . Contract wages involve more important economic problems than does the wage income of the independent workman . While we can not properly exclude from the term wages so much of the income of an independent workman as arises from his personal exertion , we are nevertheless justified in devoting our attention almost exclusively to wages as determined by contract between employer and employee . An increasing proportion of the world 's work is being done under this system , and most of the important economic problems of the day are concerned with it . Who ever heard of a " labor problem " in an agricultural community where every farmer relies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , what importance attaches to the general movement of wages , whether upward or downward ? Indeed , who can determine , in such a society , how much of the total income of each farmer is wages , how much interest on capital invested in the farm ? Wages have existed ever since our first ancestors were condemned to eat their bread in the sweat of their brows ; but it is only under modern conditions , where one man pays another to work for him , that it comes to be of great importance to ascertain what laws govern the rate of wages . We shall therefore confine our study to that part of the economic field in which differentiation between employer and employee has taken place ? where the " wage system " exists ? and shall endeavor to ascertain the laws operative therein . These laws , indeed , exert an influence in the rest of the economic field as well , and are in turn influenced by.forces lying outside of the field in which the wage system prevails . What a man could get as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as a mere wage-earner ; what he could get as a // mere wage-earner helps to determine what he must gain as an independent workman. 4 . The returns resulting from the employment of a given amount of labor vary according to the conditions under which labor is employed . Let us set before ourselves , in imagination , an agricultural community in which all the land is owned by a small class of men who do not themselves engage in tillage , but hire the landless population to work upon their fields . And let us further assume that this population is unable or unwilling to migrate to other communities in search of employment . Whether there are many workmen or few , they must all seek employment upon the land , or starve . Some of the land in the community is fertile , some of it barren . Some of it requires a large expenditure of labor for every bushel of wheat or potatoes produced ; some of it yields rich crops with little labor . Every good field yields a moderate crop with a small expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be at the expense of a disproportionately large application of labor , as we saw in the chapter on Diminishing Returns . Accordingly , we may safely lay down the proposition that the results arising from the application of labor to different fields , and in different methods of cultivation , will be unequal . Good land , in extensive cultivation , may yield three bushels of wheat per day 's labor expended , while poorer land yields , perhaps , two bushels , and yet poorer land one bushel . Adding one day 's labor to the amount previously spent on a piece of the best land may add only two bushels to the product , and adding still another day 's labor may add only one bushel. 5 . Equal wages for equal tasks is the rule of competitive industry . However unequal the results of labor on different fields and under different methods of cultivation , the reward of // labor ? wages ? will tend to be uniform , allowance made , of course , for differences in the physical efficiency of different laborers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees of fertility , and employs one man to cultivate each , the work on the different fields being uniformly arduous . He would be a very unusual employer if he should propose to pay the men different rates of wages , according to the fertility of the field upon which each is employed . The probable result of such a plan would be that competition would arise among the men to win the employer 's favor , each one desiring to be employed on the best field ; and in the end we should probably find that the better fields would be apportioned to the men who would agree to perform for the employer various miscellaneous services which would , generally speaking , be equal in value to the advantages they enjoyed in the way of higher remuneration . How this would work out we might consider at greater length if we did not know by experience that even the most liberal employer is averse to grading the wages of his men , not on a basis of their skill and faithfulness , but on a basis of the facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unequal rewards for the performance of equal ' tasks are of course to be found ; but for these cases the explanation , as we shall see later , is of a wholly different nature . Just as uniform wages will be paid for like tasks by any one employer , so uniform wages will be paid by all the employers in the community . No employer can keep in business unless he pays as good wages as any other . If any one raises wages slightly , he will attract to himself an increasing number of workmen , and he will soon get all he cares to have . In an earlier chapter we saw that there can not be different prices for the same commodity in the same market . This law holds good for labor as for anything else one buys or sells . // 6 . The wages of any one of a number of laborers of equal efficiency will not exceed the addition to product made by the laborer whose services are least important to the employer . Of ten fields , the best one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth $500 ; the worst one may yield only $150 . What will be the maximum wage that the employer will pay ? Not more than $150 . For he will not pay any workman more than the entire product created by the aid of that workman , and he will not , of his own volition , pay one workman more than another . Nor can any workman compel the employer to pay him more than the one on the worst field receives . Suppose that the one employed on the best field insisted on a wage of $200 . The employer would dismiss him , and place on that field the laborer formerly employed on the worst field . And so with any one of the ten laborers . What the employer would lose , if any one of them should " strike , " would be simply the product of the worst field ? $150 , according to our premises . If we assume that the ten fields are owned by different men , we arrive at an identical result . The employer who owns the poorest field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who tills it . If a workman on a better field demands more , his employer will dismiss him , and put in his place the workman formerly employed on the poorest field , whom he can easily induce to change employers by offering him a trifle more than the owner of the poorest field is able to pay . The dismissed workman must live ; probably he will have to seek employment on the abandoned field , and content himself with the wages that the owner of that field can pay . If we assume , instead of ten fields of varying fertility , one large , fertile field , giving employment to ten men , we see exactly the same principle at work . One of the men , cultivating the land extensively , may produce $5oo ; a second may add to this product $450 ; a tenth may add to // the total product of the nine previously employed only $150 . The employer will not pay the first $500 , the second $450 , and so on down to $150 . He will pay each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , he would be dismissed , and his functions performed equally well by the man who otherwise would have added only $150 . What the employer loses , when he loses any man of the ten , is the product created by the least important one of them all . 7 . The wages of any one of a number of laborers of equal efficiency can not , under competition , be permanently less than the marginal product of labor , or the addition to product made by the laborer whose services are of least importance to his employer . We have , then , an upper limit of wages above which an employer can not be compelled to go : the addition to the total output created by the man who works at the greatest disadvantage . Is there , similarly , a lower limit ? In the situation we have assumed ? a number of competing employers , each able to increase his employment of men through breaking up new , though less fertile , lands , or through more intensive tillage of lands already under cultivation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net return on the last man he employs . Let us assume that the uniform yearly rate of wages is $ 120 , while the product of the least important man varies from $120 on the least fertile farms to $175 on the most fertile ones . The man who has a fertile farm can increase his net income by offering a little more than $120 for an additional workman . Such a workman will not add $175 to the total output ? the law of diminishing returns forbids this ? but he may add $ 170 . As the employer on the least fertile field secures a product of only $120 from his last man , he is compelled to let a man go . Perhaps the man who now becomes his least important hand is worth $125 to him , and $125 // may be what the man on the next better field is worth . It still pays the farmer with the best fields to seek additional hands . The wage he must now offer is more than $125 , ? let us say , $130 . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps $165 each . Competition will still go on between the employers having the better fields and those having fields that are not so good , each rise in wages affecting , of course , the wages of all the workmen in the community . At last a point is reached where no employer can take a workman away from his competitor without offering a wage so high as to outweigh the advantages to be derived from an additional employee . Here , then , wages will tend to remain stationary . Each employer will be paying his least important man so much that any increase in wages would make that man an unprofitable member of his working force . No employer would care to take on an additional man at the existing rate of wages . This means that on every farm the least important workman adds to the total product only enough to cover his wages . The addition to product made by the man working under the least favorable circumstances is , then , not only the maximum that the employer can be compelled to pay ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we describe as the " product of labor , " that amount of valuable product which is brought into being by the presence of any particular laborer , we may say that , under competition , wages are determined by the product of the laborer working under the least advantageous circumstances ( in this case , on the poorest land ) . This laborer is known in economics as the marginal laborer , as he is on the " margin " or fringe of employment , as it were ? in a position where his continued employment is almost a matter of indifference to the employer , since his presence means neither profit nor loss . In the customary economic formula , wages , under competitive conditions , are determined by the marginal // productivity of labor ( i.e. the productivity of the marginal workman ) . 8 . An increase in the personal efficiency of labor tends to raise wages . Let us suppose that in the course of time the working force of our assumed community becomes more efficient , either through increased intelligence or through improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the case if the community is a comparatively new one , with a population imperfectly adjusted to its environment . It would then be quite possible that the product of the men working under the least favorable conditions would increase , let us say , by ten per cent . Wages under competition would also increase by ten per cent . Many causes besides changes in the personal efficiency of labor are operative in raising or lowering the level of wages . But it can not be doubted that the extremely low wages paid in such countries as India are in large measure due to the low average efficiency of the laboring class . The high wages paid in America are in part accounted for by the fact that American conditions spur the workman to an activity surpassing that of workmen in other countries . It has often been noted that immigrants from European countries work much harder than they did in their native lands . 9 . An increase in the number of workers tends to reduce marginal productivity and wages . Now let us assume that the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equally efficient workmen from another part of the country . The new men must have employment ; and there is of course plenty of work in the community for them to do ? on one condition , however . They must accept employment on fields yet poorer than any now cultivated , or they must be added to the force at work upon the better land , occu-
