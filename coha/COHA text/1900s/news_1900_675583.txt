txt " The Folly of Overambition and the Struggle for Precedence in American Society " was the subject of a sermon preached last evening , in Plymouth Church , Brooklen , i  --  y the Rev. Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis , Dr. Hillis said in part : " We have come to a time when the ambitions of men are excessive , and there is certain restlessness in society , Men overemphasize the desire to be first . Chlidren are discontented , and are not willing to live as their fathers did . There is a kind of Imflarnmatory condition in American society , and the gospel preached in the books and reviews in not the gospel of content . " Hard by the quiet streets where some of you live are other spots where the mouth of hell gapes , and the happy cottages where men live are not separated by many miles from men who preach the gospel of restlessness , and later the spar ; falls on the powder magazine of hatred . " This condition ' grows out of the love for precedence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets of the city day and night , when in the country there was a competence for them , and so they break their hearts . If men conki only be happy with the circumstances in which they are born ! " No other country has such a history as ours of poor boys who have realized their ambitions . What a stimulant to our young men , but the  --  man must be sure he has the power . You can not develop dumbness into speech , nor the faculty of handling men in one who has no love for his fellows . No wonder the stories of the successes of Clay and Lincoln and of our great merchants fall like powder on the minds of our boys , and away go all their precautions when they are bitten by ambition . " Young women also come under the same danger in the desire for social precedence , and torment men to give receptions , buy dresses , and build houses they can not afford , until men fall into debt and into temptations which are grievous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are servants in homes of millionaires who are happier than their masters . One of the most cynical and Unhappy of men is worth $10,000,000. and is reputed to be worth a:io , 000.000. t met him a year ago , when he said that everything in the city was going to the devil . I asked him why he did not use MO wealth for the benefit of the city . He re-plied that when he had made a gift of : 5100,000 on one occasion it was not appreciated . People  --  said that he had so much money he did not know what to do with it , and that his gift was not so much of a. gift after all . To-night , he dwells in the heart of his wealth , like a big spider , and is poisoning his own soul . ' Let not a rich man glory in his riches . unless he is master of his wealth . Wealth rightly used tends to Christlikeness , but wrongly used tends to evil purposes . " The Rev. Dr. Madison C. Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brooklyn , on " Marriage . " declared that marriage was becoming so much of a mercantile transaction that he would not be surprised to see , ere long , matrimonial market quotations appearing in the newspapers along with those of the Stock Exchange . Dr. Peters said : " . When I see , as a clergyman , how blind-. ly people go into marriage , I do not wonder that there are so many sad failures . I wonder that there are so many sue . cesses . In this serious matter , integrity , virtue , and religion are made to give place to snobbery , display , and fashion . There is a tendency in woman 's nature to yield to the fanciful . Society was never so much of a Vanity Fair . The maintaining of appearances is a characteristic snare and evil of our times , both in an4I out of married life . " Matrimony has become largely a matter of money , and marriage a society affair between two exquisite fools . The gold fever is epidemic , and the death rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women feign love to a rich man who , if he were poor , they would positively hate . " So common is the mercantile view of marriage becoming that I should not be surprised to see the hymeneal market list chronicled in the newspapers with the prices current in the Stock Exchange . In so-called good society it is coming to be counted a silly thing to marry for love . " The Right Rev. A. N. Littlejohn , Bishop of Long Island , because of ill-health , can not attend to his usual appointments in the churches in his diocese . Bishop George Worthington of the Diocese of Nebraska , who is in the East , has consented to take Bishop Littlejohn 's appointments during Advent , while Bishop William F. Adams of the Diocese of Easton will act for him during Lent . The Central Labor Union was offended yesterday at an alleged remark of the Rev. Newell Dwight Hillis , pastor of Plymouth Church , Brooklyn , in a recent sermon . The clergyman was quoted as saying that a laboring man working in the sewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tenement family in flour for a. year . " If . a clergyman was working in a sewer , " said a delegate , " and had to keep a family on his earnings he would know what he was talking about better . i wonder how much flour he thinks a family would need for a year . " The clergyman 's alleged remark was condemned as misleading and showing his Inexperience on the needs of families of workingmen . Two hundred or more ex-Vice Presidents of various lodges of the Independent Order of True Sisters participated ? in the celebration of the golden jubilee of the Most Worthy Grand Lodge of that organization , in the Lexington Opera House last night . There were also present many men , who had come as guests of the members , and one of these , the Rev. Dr. Moses Schlesinger , acted as toastmaster . The speech of welcome was made by Grand President Bertha Lobenstein , and Banquet President Sarah Markowitz talked about - " the day we celebrate .

" Additional teachers are needed for the Sunday school and also for the sewing school . A knowledge of the Italian language is not necessary in these schools , as the children understand English . We am greatly in need of funds for the ensuing year . We need money for current expenses and also for the new church which will , soon be built as we hope . "
