CLEANING UP CHINATOWN. 25 Arrests and Resort Visitors Badly Scared  --  More Raids Promised . Chinatown had a fright last night such as it has not extierienced in months . The police unexpectedly visited four of the most widely known resorts in that section of the city . In these places seventy-five women were found , twenty-five of whom were arrested . Later all were discharged in the Night Court by Magistrate Moss . Orders have been issued that Chinatown must be thoroughly cleaned up . Last night was tile beginning of the work , which , according to Capt . , is going to keep up until it will be safe to hang a gold watch on any lamp post in Chatham Square at any hour . The places raided were " Diamond Dan " O'Rourke 's at 180 Park Row , " Paddy " Mullen 's at tl Mott Street , " Dan " Valenti 's at 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Row . The raiding started about 10 o'clock , and in half an hour the excitement in Chinatown was at a fever heat , all nations joining in the hullabaloo that was raised in front of the raided places . " Diamond Dan " O'Rourke 's place was the first place to feet the effect of the new order of things in the district . The back room of that place was crowded with drinking and dancing men and women when Capt . and four plainclothes men walked in . Capt . placed himself against the door and announced that everybody was under arrest . That started a racket . Men tried to jump out of the windows and women screamed and begged to be allowed to go . Some of the latter declared  --  and their escorts hacked them up ? that they were only sightseeing and that if the police would let them go they would never visit Chinatown again . All w ho could give a plausible excuse for being there were released . Only ten were held for the Night Court , At Mullen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and the scene in O'Rourke 's was duplicated . Such welldressed men and women as gave the " seeing Chinatown " excuse were allowed to go . Eight prisoners was the result of this raid . " The Flea Bag . " at 128 Park Row , raided for the two hundred and twentyfirst time , was the third place visited . Here the police made quick work of the j crowd , which was not so large . Only four prisoners were taken . Valenti 's place was almost deserted when the police got there and yielded only three prisoners . The crowd that gathered to watch the raids was the biggest since Chinatown has seen since the visit of the Chinese Prince several years ago . " I am going to make this as clean as , any place in New York . " said Capt . last night . " These raids well keep up just as long as there is a place that does n't toe the mark .
