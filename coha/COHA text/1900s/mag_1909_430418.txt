A YEAR ago the Garibaldi , a little Chilean trading-cutter , lay moored in a beautiful cove , like a toy thing under the great mountains which rose sheer and forbidding above it . Aboard were five men ? three Austrians , a Chilean , and myself ? and I venture to say we were the only white men afloat in the Fuegian Archipelago south of Beagle Channel . A few streaks of gray morning twilight filtered by the form of an Austrian on watch , which blocked the hatchway , and the rain blew in or dropped in big pools from his oilskins on to the cabin floor . From the storm-dripping deck I lowered a bucket over the side and washed myself in the soft brine , which all but froze on my face and hands in the icy wind . Blinding gales of sleet and rain beat down upon us from masses of sullen , scurrying clouds and flung the perturbed gray waters foaming out into the Antarctic or madly dashing against the stern and precipitous mountain shores of Navarin Island . They painted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dank mountains , which , with their boggy , soggy soil , seemed , like gloomy leviathans , to have just risen dripping from the sea . Across the broad reach of Ponsonby Sound rose the peaks of the Wollastons and Hoste Island , head-dressed with perpetual snows ; a region grand , desolate , elemental , teeming with the stories of gales , cold , and disasters , where for one whole year there was not a single fine day , but three hundred of continuous rain , including twenty-five storms ; a region which is the southernmost limit of vegetation , and where dwell the southernmost inhabitants of the world , the Yahgan Indians . Here nature seems not only to resent the intrusion of mankind , but at every hand to thwart and harass his existence . The precipitous shores of the mountainous islands , covered with rain-soaked bog , rock , and impenetrable forests , render travelling by land impracticable or impossible . Add to this a dearth of food supply , hazardous in the getting , and we find , by very force of circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an existence of unsurpassed nomadism and primitiveness . So the Yahgan constructs his canoe of a heavy beech log and seeks the paths of least resistance , the storm-swept channelways , often venturing into the broad reaches of the sounds and the very oceans in search of stranded whales , seals , seaotters , birds , and fish , or of new spots whereon to erect his wigwams of beech branches , handy to a supply of mussels . Dwelling here in the solitudes , shut away by nature 's barriers from other races , the Yahgans , so their older men have told me , thought that before the white men came they were the only human beings . This is borne out , too , by the fact that they call themselves just Yamana ( man ) , and their language Yaman-hahsha ( man 's voice ) . The central part of the territory , occupied by those Fuegians who spoke the same language and who inhabited the archipelago on and south of Beagle Channel , was a resort in Murray Narrows called Yahga-ashaga ( Yahga Channel ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus to distinguish them from the other Canoe Indians , to the westward and north , a pioneer missionary called them Yahgan , wisely following out literally , in the case of a tribe , a custom applied by the Indians to the individual , for they mostly take their names from the place where they are born . One of my Indians was from this family group , as his name ? Yahgaashagan ? indicated . While the Yahgans make short excursions in the vicinity of their camps for certain berries and fungi in their sea- sons , and in the winter sometimes hunt the wild , deerlike guanacos over the frozen snow , yet they are essentially Canoe Indians . Nature , with her warring cohorts of wind , rock , water , and ice , has exacted her daily tribute , the never-ceasing struggle for existence thus disintegrating the , communities and curtailing their increase . So with the Yahgan it has perforce been a question primarily of blubber and belly , a consideration of present physical needs ? where he came from he knows not , whither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that these people are the most savage and in the lowest state of improvement of any in the world ; addicted to treachery , bloodthirstiness , and even cannibalism . The sight of the long-haired figure crouching within his wigwam of beech boughs , inured to cold , so that a single otter-skin over his back suffices to clothe him , dwarfed and stunted through centuries of squatting in canoes , often large-headed , with a countenance rendered hideous by cold , want of food , and isolation from civilization , would seem to bear out these statements . But , undoubtedly where verification has been difficult , gross exaggerations have arisen , and while the elemental passions are strongly developed in the Yahgans , still they have tractable and likeable qualities . Seldom have I looked upon a Yahgan that his high cheek-bones , dark-colored oblique eyes , straight black hair , and hairless brown face have failed to impress me with his striking similarity to the Japanese , which was still further emphasized by his shortness of stature . The tallest Yahgan ( Beagle Channel ) I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the shortest ( Mussels Bay ) was four feet ten and three-quarter inches ; and of some fourteen measurements of males taken , the average was five feet five and seveneighth inches , the women being shorter . While certain Yahgans have aided shipwrecked crews , yet there are many instances of sailors who , abandoning their vessels and weathering the Horn in small boats , weakened and starving , have managed to enter the archipelago only to be brutally butchered by the Fuegians . It is no enviable lot to be found by them defenceless in any of the innumerable out-of-the-way places of their habitat . But whatever brutalities may be laid at the door of the Yahgan , child of his environment , they can in no wise mitigate the shameful atrocities heaped upon him by sealers and others , who at times have run to cover in his vicinity from the fierce Antarctic storms . One American sealing master , passing within hailing distance of a group on shore , with wan- ton destruction poured a gun-load of grape-shot into them . Fuegian women are kidnapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the Fuegians the sight of white men becomes a signal for arming themselves and sending their women scurrying into the woods . From the dim past the Yahgan has fought a winning fight against the onslaught of the elements , combating them with all the dogged aggressiveness of his powerful frame . But contact with the white man , though slight , has been to him the touch of a deadly thing . Here he met insidious , unseen foes , intangible to his crude mind and poisonous to his healthy body , and from that day his has been a dogged retreat . As nearly as can be estimated , twentyeight years ago three thousand Yahgans paddled their canoes among these waterways ; to-day I doubt whether the total Yahgan population of these regions exceeds one hundred and seventy-five , an astounding decrease , averaging one hundred a year . This remnant maintains its independence in the very face of its destiny , continuing its blood feuds , increased perhaps by the necessity of a greater community life and the fight for wives . I doubt if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining their independence as these . I believe that nowhere else can people be found living so primitive an existence as the Fuegians ( Yahgans , Alacalufs , and Onas ) , yet I consider that in many ways they have risen above t h e crude circumstances of their land . The climate inures them to cold to a remarkable extent . A few years ago the Yahgan 's only covering was a single sealskin or four otterskins bound at the throat with a thong , covering only t h e shoulders and back . They shifted their clothes about to the front or side according to the direction of the wind . Some were entirely destitute of covering of any kind ; undoubtedly this need is mitigated by grease and dirt , which at least renders them waterproof . To one who has experienced the bitter cold of these regions , doubly clothed with t h e heaviest garments ,  | this inurement seems incredible . By those to the east of Beagle Channel , guanacoskins were used . The acquisition now of clothes by all the Yahgans save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drink , and blood feuds . There are four family groups , the Eastern of Beagle Channel , who are the best formed ; the Lennox-Islanders , bigheaded , ugly , powerful men ; the dwarfish Wollaston group , and the Southwesterns about Hoste Island , who are the most warlike and murderously inclined . The last three , however , now mingle with one another more or less , and it was to their rendezvous the shores of Rio Douglas ? near the southwestern corner of Navarin Island that our cutter was heading . South of us from the coast of Navarin a small islet detached itself . On the other side of it , Rio Douglas emptied into a bay of the same name . Here on the outskirts of the Yahgan village site a missionary had recently ensconced himself . As the Garibaldi rounded the islet my fear of finding the place temporarily forsaken by the Yahgans was allayed . Coming toward us was a canoe in which five dusky figures crouched at their paddles , while rising against the distant mountain slopes on the left bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp-fires , emanating from the village , hidden by an intervening point of land . We gathered from the canoe that they were in search of the bodies of two Yahgans who had gone to their death the night before in the icy waters upon which we floated . With outfit piled into the small boat , we were soon pulling up-river , the canoe accompanying us . Rounding the point , we came in full view of the settlement . Drawn up above tide-water a small fleet of canoes streaked the beach , and on a higher level which ran back from the crown of the shore a dozen Yahgan dwellings sent as many smoke wreaths issuing from their tops against the dark woods behind . Some of the dwellings were huts built of small tree trunks or picked-up wreckage ; others were typical and made solely from beech boughs stuck in the ground , their tops bent over and lashed at the centre . The keen-eyed Yahgans had long been  | aware of our approach , and as we drew inshore the whole village could be seen issuing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's edge accompanied by many yelping dogs , with which every camp swarms . " El Chiquito " ( the very little one ) , remarked Old Fort , the skipper , as he motioned toward the small , thick-set figure of a white man , smaller than any of the Yahgans , who issued from a recently constructed bungalow half hidden in a copse of trees , and came running down to the river 's edge . " El Chiquito " proved to be the missionary , Mr. John Williams , with whom I returned . On parting I shook the skipper 's horny hand ; he had played fair with me , but I did not regret my change of quarters from the ill-kept Austrian trader . I watched his lank figure stride down to the beach , where , after a few words with a group of Indians , he shoved off for the Garibaldi , which lay a mile or more down the bay . The Yahgans at once repaired to their dwellings , returning with sea-otter skins to trade , and soon three canoes were following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from view . The Garihalcli was well stocked with the vile watchiki , a poisonous , mind-inflaming alcoholic drink , and her skipper , like others , had no compunctions against first stealing a chunhie 's mind and then his pelts . One could easily foresee the results of this visit to the cutter . They spent perhaps their season 's catch of otter - skins for six bottles of watchiki , and returned with half of it drunk , a crazed , full - headed , emptyhanded crowd , with still enough left to go the rounds with those on shore . At Rio Douglas , as elsewhere , my time was entirely occupied in close study of these Indians ? entering as far as possible into their life , and leaving no stone unturned in acquiring information and data of this all but vanished people . This was the largest existing community , and when in full complement , including some forty then hunting in the Wollastons , aggregated about seventy - five . It was here at Rio  | Douglas that I took on four Yahgans , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawl-like boat . The days spent in this village were replete with incidents and interesting phases of Yahgan domestic life . I was constantly impressed , to make use of a platitude , that human nature is much the same the world over . It is the technique of exisience that interests us ; the novelty and surprise come through the different ways in which different peoples do the same things . The Yahgan is as gregarious as his food-supply and wanderlust will permit . From infancy his is a roving , restless life of change , unused to restraint save that of appetite in a foodless country . Consequently his communities are composed of a fluctuating population . On one occasion , not so very many years ago , the wigwams of two hundred and forty Yahgans were pitched at Wulyia , north of Rio Douglas , more than could be mustered to-day were the whole Yahgan population brought together . But while one day may see at a rendezvous an animated village , the next may find nothing but deserted wigwams left pitched on glistening mussel-heaps . These mounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old resorts of the tribes and are composed of mussel shells , bones , and refuse thrown out from their wigwams . It must have taken centuries to bring about the vast accumulations of some of these Yahgan village sites . Some of the large middens I have measured have been ten feet high , and would be circumscribed by a circle forty feet in diameter . Not only at the camp at Rio Douglas , but on both sides of the river at frequent intervals , for perhaps a mile or more , were shell-heaps , some overgrown and almost completely hidden with weeds , bushes , and trees . The Yahgans are polygamous , the older men generally taking as wives the young girls , leaving the older ones to the young men , reasoning that the latter do not know how to care for a wife , while an older woman is trained to help him fish , build fires , paddle his canoe , etc . This custom , together with the present scarcity of women , results in many of the young men being too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to remain single . A prospective son-inlaw will sometimes give labor , build a canoe , or make presents to the father of the girl , who then tells his daughter to " go sit in So-and-so 's wigwam. "  | In the distribution of labor the men travel and hunt in the vicinity of the coast . The women , who are excellent swimmers , do the fishing , gather mussels , and dive for sea eggs , weave baskets , cure skins , paddle the canoe when travelling , and attend to the children and the wigwams . , These wigwams are by no means as uncomfortable as one might suppose ; iii fact they are frequently too hot even in this cold climate . The Yahgans themselves have not become fully inured to the smoke from their fires , as their inflamed and watery eyelids often show . There is only one way to escape smoke in a Yahgan wigwam ? go outside . It has been said that the skill of these people in some respects must be compared to the instinct of animals , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their struggle for existence than all the skill and invention of civilization have served many white men isolated in these parts . I consider the Yahgans , as a people , inherently intelligent . Also it is my opinion that they are not autochthonous , but that in the dim past they drifted south to these desolate regions . While we do not know what manner of men they were at that time , we may safely assume that for perhaps a thousand years they have paddled their canoes through these channels . Their means of communication is by face-painting , language , signs , and intuition . The Yahgan language ( Yatigan ) has no written characters , though it is one of great richness , comprising a vocabulary of the surprising number of at least forty thousand words . Yatigan is by no means unpleasant in sound , for it abounds in vowels , well disposed and euphonious in their distribution , and it practically comprises all the vowels and consonants of the English . Its terms , however , are almost entirely specific in both verbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have no general word meaning " leaves , " but only specific ones , as " shupia " ( leaves of shupia ) , and " ooscootah " ( leaves of ooshcootali ; neither have they any term in general for fish or for birds , although they class them in three orders , as , in the latter , bik ( land birds ) , piece ( beach birds ) , iacasi ( sea birds ) . Another peculiarity is the great variety of adverbs of place , and the compounding of the verbs and adverbs ; while their numerical system stops at molten ( three ) . Early in the morning of my arrival at Rio Douglas the sun had shone for a while , but the clouds soon closed over , enshrouding everything with a damp , cloudy chill , accentuating the gloom and unrest which had settled over the camp because of the death of the two Yahgans . Even the dogs seemed imbued with the gray silence , broken only now and again by a longdrawn - out wail . indescribable in i t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yahgans , one a woman , were journeying from Wulyia south to Rio Douglas . Early in the morning a solitary Indian paddled up to the camp and told how the canoe had capsized in the darkness and storm of the night ; how he alone had managed  | to climb back into it , but that perhaps the woman , who was a good swimmer , had been able to reach a near-by point . Whatever may be the gullibility of the Yahgan , he will not swallow with offhand credulity any such unconfirmed statement . Furthermore , the man in question was known to be treacherous , and a recent episode in which he and his father had done away with two white men was still fresh in their minds . Consequently an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust permeated the entire camp , for the dead men were mourned . This was evidenced by their relatives cutting their hair in a round s p o t on top of their heads , with knives , mussel shells , or sharp stones ; painting their faces with yupooshug , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toomooiahboo. from a shell - like composition picked up along the beach . This painting rendered their expression hideous as I glimpsed them in passing the opening of their wigwams . As the forenoon drew on , the murky sky sent drizzling showers of rain sifting across land and water , through which emerged the returning canoes . The acute sight of the camp Indians detected something wrong . The occupants of the canoes were struggling , and the men of the village made for the shore , some armed with heavy sticks ; several seized the paddles from their beached craft , and as the other canoes , half-paddled , half-earlied by the current , came in , dragged them up on the beach . Augmented by numbers , the fight became general . It was a weird sight , those struggling Yahgans . In surging , swaying groups and pairs they strung out over the dreary landscape between the river and the village . Their wild yells , reinforced by the barking dogs and the shouts and cries of the excited women in the camp , echoed and re-echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the melee I occasionally traced the course of a heavy paddle , as , raised high aloft , it crashed down upon some black head ,  | and the sickening sound of the dull impact of wood on bone reached me . Some of them , not content with fists or wood , had resorted , as is their wont , to one of the most ferocious ways of fighting , which to see makes one 's blood run cold . Two , not satisfied with the swinging whacks of their powerful arms , had paused in their fighting and dashed to one side . Each acquiring two large stones , tightly gripped in their strong fingers , they returned to the fray and proceeded to rain down upon each other crushing blows of sledge-hammer force . How these enraged stoics endured this gruelling was beyond my comprehension , but I have no doubt that their heavy shocks of black hair served effectively as buffers . This milling did not last long , however . The stones discarded , they proceeded , as did others , to what was perhaps their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of fighting ? wrestling . Each interlaced the fingers of his two hands at the back of his adversary 's neck , and placing a knee against the other 's chest , glaring with his black eyes through blood-painted face , strove to give the coup de grace , consisting of suddenly and unexpectedly jerking the head forward , which , if successful , breaks the neck . There was a strange fascination in this repulsive striving for brute mastery , but being in doubt as to our own safety in the termination of the wild spectacle , I took the precaution to go into the house and load my Winchesters . Crossing to the window of my room , through which entered a dull apology for daylight , I became aware of a presence outside , and looked up to meet the peculiar , steadfast gaze of a Yahgan looking fixedly at me through the window ; he then passed along . Seeing that the Colt 's I always carried was fully charged , I emerged from the house and started on a run toward the nearest struggling group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching them I saw a blow aimed at his head , which luckily was intercepted by a Yahgan named Athleenatah . At sight of me Mr. Williams motioned not to approach , for , as he explained afterward , he was afraid of the results of a stranger 's interference . The situation was plain . Aided by three mission Indians he had managed to separate two antagonists , then , dividing his forces , endeavored to conduct the combatants to their respective wigwams . Mr. Williams and one Indian were hauling , dragging , and half-carrying the more powerful of the two . With the  | courage and tenacity of a man twice his size , the plucky little missionary eventually landed his man , turning him over to the none too gentle surveillance of the women . In due time the camp was restored to some semblance of order , and with strips of adhesive plaster and several yards of bandage from my emergency kit I patched up an ugly head gash and an open cheek which old Athleenatah had received in defending Mr. Williams . During this operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetrator of the wounds , and in the same breath childishly begged for some rice . Vengeance is indiscriminately practised on the entire family of a manslayer , all such being laid under tribute to all the friends of the murdered person that they may purchase exemption from bodily injuries . The death revenge is generally achieved by stealth and hidden methods ; otherwise openly in large numbers . In the latter case they arrive on shore in war paint , and the opposing factions first mingle together , shaking their spears and paddles , and for perhaps two or three hours yelling their grievances and derision before beginning the fight . Even the twilight , which holds on in summer in these antarctic regions 1 a t e into the night , seemed , like the gray , wet canopy of storm and cloud , to have settled with an oppressive heaviness over everything . There h a d been a certain weirdness about the day , but the night was uncanny . I sat alone for a long time before a wood fire . The driving storm without seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grief . The rain beat fiercely on the corrugated iron roof , and in spasmodic , driving gusts the wind soughed through the forests , and sifted through the cracks in the eaves , bearing in from the wigwams of the mourners , with its own wild lament , that long-drawn minor wail , starting from a pianissimo , then reaching a crescendo almost at D flat , and ending in a curtailed diminuendo again , the tone dropping slightly . Occasionally from another wigwam would drift to my ears , in the same doleful note , " Iii muttuwahgoo ! " ( I am sorrowful ! ) . Again and again through the dark night the wild gusts blew aside the little rifts of ashes , and fanned the flames in fitful starts as those piercing cries of grief rent the air . And so for days and nights at frequent intervals the bitter lamentation went on . With these children of nature , as with all uncivilized peoples , a noise is not without its value , for that single cry proclaims to an entire village , visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the camp . Sometimes this form of proclamation sounds out at intervals for months , its cause generally being the arrival of strangers . The next morning , carried from the camp on the winds of the storm , still unabated , came a weird monotonous halfcry , half-chant , strongly aspirated in its staccato movement . It was the Yahgan  | death-song , and I was soon to see one of their ceremonies , grotesquely fascinating in its ghoulish character ? the deathdance , rarely witnessed by a white man . At this time the death-song is sung singly or by many , and their faces are blackened with soot , which before the recent acquisition of clothes , was also smeared over their bodies . Recently about forty Yahgans came in ten canoes from Mussels Bay on the death of one of their number . Upon arriving they at once cut sticks and , accompanied by the Rio Douglas Indians , went into the forests and held a dance . This visit was later returned , upon which occasion , I presume , the same ceremony was repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were in their wigwams , laid up from yesterday 's fight or in a drunken stupor , so that from the outskirts I looked into the camp at a swaying , rotating circle of unkempt Yahgan squaws , their black hair hanging in stringy strands or heavy masses about their broad faces , each holding a long thick pole in either hand . These they pounded on the earth in slow cadence , alternating or together with the treading of their bare feet . In slow rotation they stepped back and forth , back and forth , constantly swaying their squat , heavy frames , and with their broad mouths murmuring the bile , or singing the death-song , some chanting in a higher pitch than others . Later in the day the climax of this orgy was reached . A sudden bedlam reverberated throughout the valley , hoarse shouts and cries intermingled with the wailing chant . Hurriedly reaching my vantage-point again , I looked upon a crowd of furies circling around one another , keeping up only a semblance of the dance . The ring had now shrunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbed and pounded viciously at a bundle of rags . A shudder passed over me when the bundle of rags tried to stagger to its feet , to be at once felled flat to the earth again by a savage blow . There it writhed , turned , and twisted in vain endeavor to extricate itself from the infuriated onslaught of the frenzied harpies . For " a second I caught sight of the face ? it was that of the survivor of the canoe accident , a wiry fellow of about  | thirty , and in the vanguard of his assailants were the two wives of the drowned men . After having suffered a horrible pounding , he managed , more dead than alive , to wriggle outside the ring , where he half-crawled , half-dragged himself to his wigwam . All might have been well with this survivor who first returned had not the woman who swam ashore been picked up and brought to Rio Douglas that morning . Her story had differed a trifle from the man 's ; the other two had been drowned , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take upon themselves this revenge on one who is in particular disfavor within their community . It does not always stop at a severe beating , as in the case of a Yahgan named Guiamamool , who was beaten to death for the murder of another Indian . In few parts of the world , perhaps , are the effects of environment on man so noticeably potent as in Fuegia . Were I to select from the Yahgans two characteristics which pre-eminently distinguish them from the rest of mankind , they would be the absence of those elemental attributes which even the most barbaric of races seem to have acquired ? chieftainship and religion . This again , I believe , is due mainly to the terrible exigencies of climate . The Yahgans must scatter to obtain food . Each depends upon no hand but his own , and is able with his wives or in family groups to survive the conditions of his desolate lands ; but literally as well as figuratively he must paddle his own canoe . When in answer to the blue smokes , which signal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed rendezvous where perhaps they dwell as a community for weeks at a time , having already proved sufficient unto themselves , each brings with him that inflexible independence which will owe allegiance to no one . Occasionally , however , they show deference to an older man and revere experience and physical prowess . In their community life they are most socialistic , going to one another 's wigwams and partaking freely of one another 's food . It is quite customary for one to divide equally with the others a windfall of the chase or plunder . While from the point of view of the anthropologist the Yahgan is both an animist and polydaemonist , believing that spirits enter into and control the phenomena of nature , he has no religion in the general acceptance of the term . For here again that weird Nature , whose phenomena he has personified in his imagination , has also by her exigencies dwarfed his introspection . No word for " God , " " Creator , " or " pray " has ever appeared in his language , nor from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things be inferred . Among his superstitions he believes in an evil spirit which takes possession of one , and he has a word for " spirit , " and is very uneasy , too , at hearing it mentioned , for it is said that if named , it appears . With the Yahgan there is no past , and from the moment when the heart ceases to beat there is no future , for there is not the least scintilla of evidence that he believes in any hereafter . When a man dies " he is gone , " the Yahgans say , " is no more , " and do all that is possible to blot out his memory , and for superstitious reasons it is even a great provocation to mention his name . One of the most convincing proofs to me of their disbelief in futurity is the complete destruction of all that belongs to the deceased . If a woman , her fish-basket , shell ornaments , and fish-lines are thrown into the sea ; if a man , his wigwam and its appurtenances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs of the dead Indians were drowned , and their canoes were split from end to end . So it is with the Yahgans ? no past , no future ; without chiefs , without gods .  |
