Harris and other State officials zespecting Ohio 's choice of a candidate for the Presidency . The Senator says it Is " difficult to make a polite answer " to a part of Chairman Brown 's statement . declaring that " for rank , dictatorial and offensive bossism it far exceeds anything I can recall . " He gives definite notice that he not only resents Chairman Brown 's dictation , but that his choice for the Presidency will be named by the next convention of Ohio Republicans , and that he will abide by that choice . The declaration for Taft by Gov . Harris , Attorney General Ellis , and Secretary of State Thompson leaves not a single Ohio politician of any prominence on the side of Dick and Foraker except John Malloy , Secretary of the State Central Committee . It will be recalled that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Foraker declared that Gov . Harris must be renominated , and gave him a fulsome eulogy . Hitherto not a human being in Ohio has been able to extract from the Governor " the slightest hint whether he was for Foralter or Taft . Gov . Harris 's renomination is a certainty . Secretary of State Thompson is the most pussy-footed politician this side of the Mississippi . lie is such an adept in the art of lying low that nobody expected him to deciars ? one way or the other until the last gun had been fired . Attorney General Ellis has been one of the mainstays of the Dick-Foraker faction , as has been Chairman Brown . Until now Ellis 's loyalty to Dick find Foraker had never been questioned .

" No one need suffer , certainly not wrongfully , if we proceed in order . ns lead of trying to rush conclusions by unofficial announcements and declarations . " So far as the control of the State organization is concerned , I have never made any claim to that .

" As to the rest of Mr. Brown 's statement , It is difficult to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bossism It far exceeds anything I can recall . It amounts to a threat that unless I straightway declare for Mr. Taft I shall lose the Senatorship . That may be , but if so , the fact has no terrors for me . " I said at Canton that I would not be dictated to by any kind of a boss , big or little , inside or outside the State . I meant that announcement for just each bosses as Mr. Brown , and for just such performarrees as he is now giving us . " To be specific , I emphatically resent his dictation and give him notice that my choice for the Presidency will be named by the next Ohio Republican Convention that Is lawfully held to nominate State officers , and that , so far as I am personally concerned , I shall abide the action of that convention as to whether I shall be a candidate again for any office , and if so what that office shall be .
