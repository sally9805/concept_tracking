txt The Cuban reciprocity situation clarified somewhat to-day . but not in a way very satisfactory to the friends of Cuba . Things were being done at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue . At I1 the White House end the President , roused to action by the imminent danger of the failure of his plan , was rounding up beet sugar Senators and pleading with them to carry out the Administration 's scheme of relief for Cuba . At the Capitol end the beet-sugar Senators were holding a little caucus of their own and deciding to resist by every means in their power any measure of relief except the old Morris scheme of a rebate . The conference of the beet-sugar men was held in Senator Elkins 's committee room , and great ' secrecy was preserved about it . It was agreed that all inquiries should be answered by the statement that the conference had relation to the Congressional elections and not to the Cuban reciprocity question . The truth is , however , that the Congressional elections were not mentioned except incidentally . There were eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were unable to attend , sent notice of their adhesion to ? the programme . The eighteen Senators prase &; were : Elkins , Foster , Scott , Mitchell . Perkins , Nelson , Bard , Clapp , Gamble . Bnrton , Kittredge , Kearns , Dietrich , Jones , ( Nev. , ) Millard , Mason , Burrows , Pritchard . The beet-sugar Senators are determined , as a result of their conference , to fight to the end against any proposition that savors of reciprocity . They will consent to a rebate scheme of relief to Cuba , but this is no concession , for the beet-sugar men in the House from the very outset were willing to have a rebate scheme adopted . They said that although they did not think Cuba was entitled to relief they would consent to give a rebate , but they insisted that under no consideration must any scheme of reciprocity be passed . Tawney , Morris , and William Alden Smith were rebate men in the House . Speaker Henderson , Chairman Payne , Gen. Grosvenor , and Mr. Dalzell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it was said they represented Mr. Roosevelt and spoke for him . Some of the leading beet-sugar Senators were among those to whom the President talked this morning . The Senators listened attentively to what the President had to say , and then went down to the Capitol and attended the meeting in Senator Elkins 's room , where they gave their hearty adhesion to the scheme outlined for the beet-sugar element . It is regarded as probable that the President will agree to the rebate if necessary . At present , he is opposed to it , but if it becomes certain that no reciprocity bill can get through it is believed he will consent to a rebate rather than have it go on record that he was totally defeated by Congress at the first session of his Administration . To-night President Roosevelt had a number of Administration men at the White House to confer about Cuban reciprocity , and outlined to them his views about the way in which the beet sugar men should be fought . Those present were Senators Hanna , Platt of Connecticut , Allison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payne , Cannon , and Sherman , and Postmaster General Payne . Of these Senator Platt is the Cuban reciprocity leader in the Senate . Senator Spooner is the author of the 20  |p4r  cent . reduction compromise , which the President is ready to accept , but which the beetsugar men agreed to-day to fight , after their conference with the President . Mr. Babcock was originally a beet-sugar man , but went over to the President just before the House vote on the bill . Mr. Dalzell , Mr. Payne , and Mr. Cannon are Speaker Henderson 's right-hand men and strong Administration leaders . Postmaster General Payne is the man who is credited by the Democrats with being the head of the new Federal machine which they say the President is building up to secure a renomination , and he has been present at several of the important conferences on political subjects held recently by the President , notably his conference with Senator Hanna . The others are Republican leaders of prominence , but who have not taken a leading part in the Cuban reciprocity fight .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
