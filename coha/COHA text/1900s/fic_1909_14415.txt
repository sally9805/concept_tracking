( a knock without , L. ) Ah  --  here they come !  --  punctual !  --  that is well ! TOMPKINS Punctuality is scarcely a virtue , sir , where our interests are so strictly concerned . Enter ROBERT , L. p. 4 ROBERT Mr. Harry Downright . TOMPKINS ( aside , R. ) Mr. Harry  --  number one . All fair words , and flummery . Exit ROBERT , L. Enter HARRY DOWNRIGHT , L. MR . DOWNRIGHT I am very happy to see you , cousin Harry . HARRY DOWNRIGHT ( shakes hands with DOWNRIGHT ) My dear fellow  --  well  --  here I am ! the first to arrive . TOMPKINS ( aside ) His dear fellow ! the familiar young puppy : I wonder that he does n't slap my respected late employer on the back . MR . DOWNRIGHT Where have you left your two partners ? I hope they will not be very much behind-hand . HARRY DOWNRIGHT My brother David had promised to see a poor fellow , whom we intend to employ  --  he will be here in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him lecturing the clerks on their shameful waste of ink and wafers in the counting house . TOMPKINS Does Mr. Job imagine that the firm of Downright can not afford to pay a stationer 's bill ? HARRY DOWNRIGHT Tompkins  --  I believe , that if cousin Job had his way , he would compel us to omit the dots to the i , and the cross to the t ; and , in default of wax and wafers , would secure his letters with odd pieces of packthread . Ha , ha , ha !  --  just like cousin Job ! p. 5 TOMPKINS I confess that I do not see the wit of that remark . HARRY DOWNRIGHT Tompkins , I never suspected you of seeing even as far as the length of your respectable nose . ( a knock , L. ) Here comes the two lags behind . Enter ROBERT , L. , shewing in DAVID , and JOB DOWNRIGHT . ROBERT Mr. David Downright , Mr. Job Downright . MR . DOWNRIGHT Good morning , cousins : I am glad to see you . Robert place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and exit , L. ) I feel much obliged to you for coming , my kind friends , I will not detain you long , for in an hour I must be on board the steamer . DAVID DOWNRIGHT My dear cousin , the pleasure of seeing you is embittered by the knowledge that we shall so soon lose your agreeable society . JOB DOWNRIGHT ( bluntly ) Suppose you let us hear what Mr. Downright has to communicate . His time I daresay is precious , and so I 'm sure is mine . MR . DOWNRIGHT And cousin Job is right . Let us be seated . ( they sit at table , DOWNRIGHT , C. , facing audience ; HARRY , R. C. ; DAVID , L. C. ; JOB front L. , TOMPKINS , R. ) Now , cousins , we are about to part , and I trust that during my absence you will find things go on as pleasantly and agreeably as when I had my friend Tompkins to assist me . I can only regret that he declines remaining in the counting house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 6 DAVID DOWNRIGHT Oh , sir , of course we do ! HARRY DOWNRIGHT Oh , sir , of course we do ! JOB DOWNRIGHT Do you ? humph ! Mr. Downright , as I observed my time is precious . ( looks at his watch ) MR . DOWNRIGHT I beg your pardon , cousin Job , I am getting tedious ; it is the fault of old age . Everything has been settled except one , and it is for the purpose of requesting your kind co-operation that I meet you here . You are aware that I have a poor relation  --  I may say that we have a poor relation , William Lackwit . JOB DOWNRIGHT A very poor relation . DAVID DOWNRIGHT Poor William Lackwit . Heaven knows I have always wished him well . HARRY DOWNRIGHT William Lackwit ! My dear cousin , not another word ; I shall consider it my duty to look after him . Be easy on that score . MR . DOWNRIGHT He is equally related to all of us , and I am sorry to say has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , think , that I , who am reputed to be rich , ought not to apply to you . But I am far from being wealthy : and I am going to America in the hope of recovering a large sum , many thousands which are due to the firm by the heirs of a deceased correspondent . I find that I can not conveniently assist poor cousin William to the extent he requires , and I recommend him to your kindness . Should I return successful , I shall be able to make some provision for him ; but should I die , promise me that my poor cousin shall not languish in poverty . Job Downright , as the eldest partner , or I should say , the senior in age , what will you promise ? p. 7 JOB DOWNRIGHT Nothing . DAVID &amp; HARRY Oh , Job , Job ! MR . DOWNRIGHT How is this ? JOB DOWNRIGHT Exactly so ! I never make promises ; you may not return , cousin Richard , you may be shipwrecked , or the steamer may be blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do believe for amusement . How do I know if the vessel in which you have taken a passage is seaworthy ? she may be some old tub , which the underwriters decline to insure , even at fifty per cent . HARRY DOWNRIGHT Really , this is too bad , dispiriting Mr. Downright in this shameful way . DAVID DOWNRIGHT It is atrocious  --  perfectly atrocious ! JOB DOWNRIGHT I daresay you think so . But , Mr. Downright , if it be only promises that you require , you can not have better men than the two gentlemen on either side of you . MR . DOWNRIGHT What do you say , David ? DAVID DOWNRIGHT That whilst I have a shilling , Will Lackwit shall never want . I should hope the firm of Downright would always be able to assist him . JOB DOWNRIGHT Suppose the firm of Downright should fail ! such things have happened , you know . p. 8 TOMPKINS The firm of Downright fail ! Mr. Job , you have no business to suppose anything of the kind ; as if the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things have happened within the memory of man , consequently I can promise nothing . MR . DOWNRIGHT Should William Lackwit want a home at any time , which of you would offer him one ? HARRY DOWNRIGHT Need you ask such a thing ? Of course my house is open to him . DAVID DOWNRIGHT And mine also . He will be as welcome as though he were my own brother . Though , as I am but a bachelor at present , I can not boast of a very well regulated home ; but my cousin Job , who has a large house and a notable wife , can do more for William than I can . JOB DOWNRIGHT ( rising ) You forget , gentlemen , that as a married man , I must consult my wife . Cousin Richard , whatever I can do I will do for William Lackwit . I must hurry away now  --  but I shall see you again . Exit , L. TOMPKINS I am afraid , Mr. Downright , that you must not expect much from Mr. Job . MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ; but I wish he had been more explicit . But to proceed :  --  I must not forget to mention that I have left my parting instructions with Tompkins , who will tell you what they are . Here is William Lackwit 's address ; and I can only say that every kindness shewn to him , will be a double kindness to myself . Enter ROBERT , L. p. 9 ROBERT The coach is at the door , sir . ( they all rise ) MR . DOWNRIGHT Then I must leave you . But I hope to meet you here in about twelve months . Should I never return , you will then open my will . DAVID DOWNRIGHT Oh , my dear cousin !  --  You will return safely , HARRY DOWNRIGHT I am sure . MR . DOWNRIGHT ( shaking hands with them ) I trust I shall . Meanwhile , I wish you every success . Tompkins will see me on board . Good-bye for the present . Exit , R. , with TOMPKINS . HARRY DOWNRIGHT What a sudden whim this is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you any idea what his will can contain ? DAVID DOWNRIGHT Not the slightest . That sly fellow Tompkins , he knows all about it ; but it is useless to try to pump him HARRY DOWNRIGHT Perfectly so . I hope that Job is no wiser than ourselves . DAVID DOWNRIGHT He would have been more civil to Richard had he been in the secret . Do you suppose that Richard is in the least embarassed ? HARRY DOWNRIGHT Embarrassed  --  embarrassed ! What makes you think so ? p. 10 DAVID DOWNRIGHT The behaviour  --  the very cautious behaviour of cousin Job . Enter JOB , L.Bless me , Job , what brings you back ? But you are too late  --  Mr. Downright is gone . JOB DOWNRIGHT I know it ; I parted with him on board the steamer , " The Good Intent , " and if ever a ship belied its name , I should say that was the vessel . I never saw a more villainous-looking tub in the whole course of my experience . I would n't insure her , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended such a worthless craft ? DAVID DOWNRIGHT ( angrily ) If you must know , sir  --  I did ! JOB DOWNRIGHT Oh ! very thoughtful of you to send your benefactor away in a leaky vessel ? HARRY DOWNRIGHT Mr. Job , we do n't understand such language . JOB DOWNRIGHT Then , cousins , you must be greater simpletons than I take you for . I thought you foolish when you were so lavish of your promises to Richard Downright , respecting that poor spendthrift , William Lackwit . Now I am confirmed in my opinion . HARRY DOWNRIGHT What do you mean to insinuate ? What do you suspect ? DAVID DOWNRIGHT Yes ; what do you suspect ? Come now , cousin Job , as our partner you ought to tell us . Is it anything that can affect our interest  --  no , no , I mean that affects our dear friend ? p. 11 JOB DOWNRIGHT Let us first consider the question of interest , which I presume is naturally of the first importance to each of us . DAVID DOWNRIGHT Not to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOWNRIGHT Am I ? HARRY DOWNRIGHT Yes , sir ; very much mistaken , indeed , when you judge us according to your own standard and your own feelings . JOB DOWNRIGHT We need not quarrel , Harry ; I merely say that I prefer payment , and performance , to promises . Let us dispute no further . Here comes Mr. Tompkins , with more last words for us . Enter TOMPKINS , L.Well , Mr. Tompkins , what news ? TOMPKINS Our respected friend has left us . The " Good Intent " has left the pier , and is steaming down the river . By-the-bye , gentlemen , I have a few words to say to you before we part . HARRY DOWNRIGHT They will be as binding to me as a bond . DAVID DOWNRIGHT And the same to me . JOB DOWNRIGHT Let us hear what you have to say , Tompkins , for it is nearly post time . I must hurry away . TOMPKINS I shall not detain you long , gentlemen . But to proceed  --  it is Mr. Downright 's wish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will write to the firm when he arrives in America , and also when he returns to England . p. 12 HARRY DOWNRIGHT Very strange ! Are we to hear nothing of our respected benefactor during that time ? DAVID DOWNRIGHT What a deprivation it will be . JOB DOWNRIGHT Go on , Mr. Tompkins , or else I must leave you to tell the remainder of my cousin 's wishes to my two partners . TOMPKINS I really beg pardon . Well , the last wishes of my respected benefactor are , that his cousin , your poor relation , should find a home with some of you . Which of you three gentlemen will undertake the charge of him ? Mr. Job , what say you ? JOB DOWNRIGHT That I shall consult my wife , and think about it  --  but you may give me his address . TOMPKINS Here it is , sir , and I feel sure that you will do what you can for that poor Mr. William . JOB DOWNRIGHT Tompkins , you may be a good man of business , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer for any man 's good intentions . Be guided by his actions , and even then you may be deceived . No , it is to my cousins that I refer you on this occasion . They have promised a great deal , and will doubtless keep their word . I wish you good morning . Exit , L. DAVID DOWNRIGHT What , is he gone  --  really gone ? p. 13 HARRY DOWNRIGHT It looks uncommonly like it . He has certainly disappeared through the doorway ; and I do not imagine that he has any intention of returning , either down the chimney or in at the window . DAVID DOWNRIGHT Very strange conduct ! and as he is the head of the firm , nothing ought to be done  --  in fact , nothing can be done without consulting him . TOMPKINS But , Mr. David , this is not a matter of business  --  it is quite an affair of private charity . DAVID DOWNRIGHT Pardon me , Mr. Tompkins , this is not a paltry private affair ; the honor of the firm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done hand- somely . I shall bring the subject formally before the firm . TOMPKINS And in the meantime , sir  --   --  DAVID DOWNRIGHT I wish you good morning  --  you shall hear from me shortly . Exit , L. TOMPKINS It strikes me that Mr. David can also find it convenient to make his way out at the door , as well as Mr. Job . HARRY DOWNRIGHT Ha , ha , ha ! poor David  --  he very quickly takes offence ; but I must hurry after him , or in the heat of the moment he may refuse to do anything . p. 14 TOMPKINS But yourself , Mr. Harry  --   --  HARRY DOWNRIGHT Oh , of course I shall consent to whatever the firm proposes . Good-bye , Tompkins  --  I shall be delighted to see you whenever you come my way . Good-bye . Exit , door , L. TOMPKINS Either that door possesses great attraction , or else I have been a very bad advocate . Now what am I to say to Mr. Richard ? Enter ROBERT , L.Well , Robert , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should rather say a parcel for you , sir : and the messenger who brought it would neither tell me who he was , nor where he came from , ( gives parcel and exit , L. ) TOMPKINS What can this mysterious parcel be ? ( opens it ) Ha ! a note addressed to me , and in a female handwriting , or else in that of a very weak-minded male . ( reads ) " Mr. Tompkins is requested ( by one who knows his trustworthiness ) to employ the enclosed sum in relieving the necessities of Mr. Lackwit , to whom the writer is unknown . The numbers of the notes have been retained . " Oh , indeed ! well then I ca n't steal them . But what are they ? ( opens a folded paper ) Can I believe my eyes !  --  a hundred pounds in five-pound notes ! Who can this unknown benefactor be ? I would give  --  yes , I would give five pounds to find out . Enter RICHARD DOWNRIGHT , from a closet  --  he comes behind TOMPKINS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . DOWNRIGHT And I would give ten to find out . TOMPKINS Mercy on us , Mr. Downright ! What ! are you here ? What has become of the " Good Intent ? " MR . DOWNRIGHT She has been telegraphed to return . I came back , and from that closet have heard every word of the conversation between you  --  Cautious Cousin Job , Dashing David , and Hearty Harry . TOMPKINS What is your opinion of them , sir ?  --  I pronounce them to be three humbugs . MR . DOWNRIGHT So do not I ; but I must return on board before I am missed , and before any one knows that I have been on shore . We can slip out unperceived  --  it is almost dusk . Come along , Tompkins , and you shall have the benefit of some more last words . Exeunt , R. A Year is supposed to have elapsed since Scene First. @x SCENE .  --  As before  --  a writing table with account books chairs , &amp; c in C. JOB , at writing table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fifteen  --  and three , eighteen . Eighteen hundred pounds , the profits of the last six weeks ;  --  that is not bad for young beginners . I think my cousin Richard would be satisfied . By the way , where can my two partners be ? David had returned from ' Change , and Harry was giving audience to his tailor . Enter DAVID , L. DAVID DOWNRIGHT Well , Job , have you finished the accounts ? What do you make the sum total to be ? JOB DOWNRIGHT The clear profits are eighteen hundred . Are you not content ? DAVID DOWNRIGHT Yes  --  I suppose that we ought not to grumble . JOB DOWNRIGHT Grumble ! when you are in a fair way of making your fortune . Where is Harry ? DAVID DOWNRIGHT He is coming  --  I hear him on the stairs . Here he is . Enter HARRY , R. , he flings his hat down on the table. What is the matter , Harry ? HARRY DOWNRIGHT What 's the matter ? Why that stupid blockhead the tailor has lost my measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no coat fit to wear . p. 17 JOB DOWNRIGHT What a calamity , Harry ! Shall you be able to survive it ? HARRY DOWNRIGHT ( angrily ) Sir  --  Mr. Job ! Pshaw ! it is of no use being angry with an old square-toes like you ! JOB DOWNRIGHT I think so too . Meanwhile , can you give me your attention to a matter of business ? HARRY DOWNRIGHT Do n't worry me about business , Job . I have betted heavily on the brown colt , Thunderbolt , and ca n't attend to anything else . JOB DOWNRIGHT Oh , indeed ! Well , much an important matter as the result of a race must claim precedence . ( closes his book  --  rises ) I have just received a note from Mr. Tompkins , who is coming here . DAVID DOWNRIGHT What ails him ? I hope he is all right . JOB DOWNRIGHT I hope so ; but he communicates with us every six months  --  and it is just half a year since he wrote to us . I have also received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lackwit ? What makes him turn up just now ? I thought that he had been provided for by the firm . JOB DOWNRIGHT If you remember , neither yourself nor David came to any decision ; so I could do nothing in the name of the firm . p. 18 HARRY DOWNRIGHT He has had his annuity ? JOB DOWNRIGHT Of two pounds a week ; just what you tell me your groom costs you : and he has a son to support  --  for he very honourably gave up all to his creditors . However , Tompkins will be better able to tell us the particulars , ( a knock without ) and here he is , as punctual as clockwork . Enter TOMPKINS , door L. TOMPKINS Good-morning , gentlemen . DAVID DOWNRIGHT You bring us news of our dear cousin Richard  --  good news , I hope ? TOMPKINS I trust that it is good news . In the first place , he is coming back very soon . HARRY DOWNRIGHT Coming back ! Coming home ! DAVID DOWNRIGHT Coming back ! Coming home ! JOB DOWNRIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have bestowed on the two trusts he confided to us ; namely , the firm , and poor cousin William . TOMPKINS The firm , I know , is in the most flourishing condition ; and I am convinced that Mr. Downright 's wishes respecting his poor relation have been attended to , particularly after the promises you made . JOB DOWNRIGHT If you remember , I made none , Mr. Tompkins . p. 19 TOMPKINS No , Mr. Job , you did not . I allude to these gentlemen . HARRY DOWNRIGHT Why , you see , Tompkins , this has been a busy year with us . Since we saw you , we have both married . Besides , William Lackwit has never applied to us  --  at least I have heard nothing of it if he has . JOB DOWNRIGHT I beg your pardon ; Mr. Lackwit wrote repeatedly to ask us if we could find employment for his son . You would not consent to receive him into our counting-house . HARRY DOWNRIGHT Heavens , David ! what do I hear ? You refused to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course there ought to be a desk for him . JOB DOWNRIGHT Harry , I am afraid that oughts here do stand for nothing . Tompkins , in what vessel does my cousin Richard take his passage . TOMPKINS He returns by the first that sails ; but has already sent good bills by the last mail . He has received considerable sums . DAVID DOWNRIGHT Has Mr. Downright been fortunate in America ? TOMPKINS He has unexpectedly recovered several thousands which he had long given up as lost . HARRY DOWNRIGHT ( aside ) I 'll send fifty pounds directly to William Lackwit . What a fool I was not to think of that before ! p. 20 DAVID DOWNRIGHT ( aside ) I will invite William Lackwit to dinner . That will be sure to please Richard . I wish I had done so long ago ! JOB DOWNRIGHT ( takes up paper ) " The Good Intent , " you said , is the vessel in which Richard was to sail ? Let me see if there are any tidings of her in the papers of to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha , what is this ? ( reads ) " We are sorry to learn that a vessel , which has since been ascertained to be ' The Good Intent , sprang a leak when off the Scilly Isles , and foundered . Every soul on board perished . " MR . DOWNRIGHT Impossible ! our dear cousin Richard ! DAVID DOWNRIGHT Impossible ! our dear cousin Richard ! TOMPKINS Is dead ! Alas , can this be true ? JOB DOWNRIGHT I fear it is . You know that I had my doubts respecting the " Good Intent "  --  I told you so , David . TOMPKINS What ought to be done now ? I came here , hoping in a few days to meet my friend and benefactor . Alas ! I can now only fulfil his last instructions , namely , to read his will ! JOB DOWNRIGHT There will be no hurry , Mr. Tompkins . I am scarcely equal to hearing it now . p. 21 DAVID DOWNRIGHT Cousin Job , would you dispute the last wishes of that excellent man ? HARRY DOWNRIGHT Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping , nor of consigning them to the silent tomb . JOB DOWNRIGHT Be it as you choose then  --  I will not dispute your will . ( sits ) TOMPKINS I think I had better go and bring the will . I shall not be long , gentlemen . Alas , my poor friend ! Exit , L. DAVID DOWNRIGHT I need not write yet to William Lackwit . HARRY DOWNRIGHT No ; it would be advisable to hear the will first . Do you not think so , Job ? JOB DOWNRIGHT About William Lackwit  --  ah , of course . It is quite right that he should be present . He is in town , I know ; and I have written to request that he will call at Mr. Richard Downright 's , where I appointed to meet him . DAVID DOWNRIGHT Indeed ! I must say , cousin Job , that you have done very wrong . None of us have ever seen William Lackwit , not even yourself . He is a perfect stranger to us . JOB DOWNRIGHT He stands in the same degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is only right that he should be present at the reading of the will , which , I must say , need not have taken place the very moment we heard of Richard 's death . As you force me to be present , you must accept of the company of our poor relation as well . p. 22 HARRY DOWNRIGHT ( with a sneer ) You expect to be sole legatee , and wish to give a touching proof of affection for poor Richard 's memory  --  love me , love my dog . It is sometimes convenient to fawn on the cur we have previously spurned , and to extend the same kindness to all the whelps of the litter . JOB DOWNRIGHT If you have abused me sufficiently , Harry , let us change the subject , and be friends , in appearance . Enter TOMPKINS , L. , and an ELDERLY MAN in spectacles ; a tie-wig , and shabby great coat . TOMPKINS Gentlemen  --  permit me to introduce your cousin , Mr. William Lackwit , JOB DOWNRIGHT ( shaking LACKWIT by the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but could have wished that our meeting had taken place under different circumstances . WILLIAM LACKWIT ( bowing stiffly ) Mr. Job . I am greatly obliged to you . HARRY DOWNRIGHT ( aside to DAVID ) The old fellow has certain expectations , he is so deuced haughty . ( to LACKWIT ) I need not say , cousin , how happy I shall be to serve you . p. 23 DAVID DOWNRIGHT And I beg to be included in the number of your friends . WILLIAM LACKWIT Have the poor any friends ? I think it is very doubtful . What say you , cousin Job ? JOB DOWNRIGHT That friends become scarcer every day ; I think the race must be almost extinct . But let us proceed to business , since we are here : cousin William , I requested your presence in order that you might learn the contents of our late cousin 's will , which Mr. Tompkins is now going to read . ( they all sit  --  TOMPKINS in the centre ) TOMPKINS ( breaking the seal of the will and glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , dated the day before the American mail sailed , and now opened for the first time ; in it my dear friend states that the bulk of his fortune he had already disposed of , in various bequests . But there still remains a further sum , the amount of which his executor , myself , will distribute between the three gentlemen who now represent the firm of Downright . HARRY DOWNRIGHT Dear cousin Richard ! he was ever considerate . DAVID DOWNRIGHT The bequest is in ready money , I suppose . TOMPKINS In ready money ; you can receive it to-morrow if you will . One-fifth of the sum is to be handed over to Mr. Job Downright , the remainder to be equally divided between Messrs Harry and David , because , as the testator observes , they so generously promised to take care of our relation William Lackwit. p. 24 DAVID DOWNRIGHT It is most generous , and what we had no right to expect . JOB DOWNRIGHT ( after a pause ) Has nothing been left to Mr. William Lackwit . TOMPKINS I regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders to pay him . Mr. Richard relies entirely on the promises made by his generous cousins . HARRY DOWNRIGHT And not in vain ; we shall certainly continue the annuity between us . DAVID DOWNRIGHT Most certainly we shall continue the annuity . JOB DOWNRIGHT And what do you intend to do for the son ; you really can afford to be generous . DAVID DOWNRIGHT The son whom you chose to take under your special protection , Mr. Job , we decline to interfere with . HARRY DOWNRIGHT Yes , we altogether decline  --  and as to the father , we shall be guided by circumstances . DAVID DOWNRIGHT Yes entirely by circumstances . Pray what are your own liberal intentions , Job ? ( they all rise ) JOB DOWNRIGHT I made no promise , but if my cousin William can put up with our plain living , our quiet mode of life , and he does not object to young children , of which I have a housefull , he is heartily welcome to consider my home as his home also . And I shall take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set apart to give young William a start in life . Cousins , those are my intentions . p. 25 TOMPKINS Mr. Job , you are a brave , noble-hearted fellow ! I wronged you ; I always thought you were cold and calculating . JOB DOWNRIGHT Because I am not profuse in promises ; they are unsafe things to deal in . And now let us adjourn to my house . Cousin William , you must make the acquaintance of my good wife . Tompkins , you will dine with us . I could not presume , David and Harry , to ask you to join our party . HARRY DOWNRIGHT Thank you , Job  --  I am engaged . DAVID DOWNRIGHT And so am I ; I promised to to take Mrs. Downright to the concert . JOB DOWNRIGHT But not to-night , I should hope . Enter ROBERT , hastily , L. , with a note , which he hands to JOB . ROBERT A note from a gentleman who wishes to see you . JOB DOWNRIGHT Shew the gentleman in . Exit ROBERT , L.But who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is signed William Lackwit senior ; who can he be ? Enter ROBERT , showing in WILLIAM LACKWIT , L. ROBERT Mr. William Lackwit . Exit ROBERT. , door L. p. 26 JOB DOWNRIGHT What , my cousin William . WILLIAM LACKWIT The same to whom your bounty has been so liberally distributed . Ah , cousin Job ! you are found out : your wife has let out the secret of the hundred pounds which I received the day after my cousin Richard had sailed . I taxed her with having written the note which accompanied it . Bless you I knew the handwriting again when I received her kind invitation . I have just arrived her  --  I went first to your house , found that you were not at home , and am come after you to thank you for your kindness to the " Poor Relation . " JOB DOWNRIGHT So you have found me out ! I never feit so foolish in all my life . But if you are William Lackwit , who is our friend here , whom Mr. Tompkins introduced to us under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish you joy , cautious cousin Job , of the new acquaintance who is to share your home . DAVID DOWNRIGHT ( to STRANGER ) I shall insist , fellow , on knowing who and what you are . Tompkins , I shall hold you answerable for this person . TOMPKINS I am perfectly willing , Mr. David , to answer for him . ( STRANGER throwing off the wig , great coat , and spectacles , discovers himself to be RICHARD DOWNRIGHT ) p. 27 MR . DOWNRIGHT No ; let me rather answer for myself . OMNES Richard Downright ! HARRY DOWNRIGHT Not dead ! MR . DOWNRIGHT No , alive . DAVID DOWNRIGHT You did n't go down then , cousin ? MR . DOWNRIGHT No , I changed my mind , and came over in the same steamer which brought my money . But I find that my unexpected arrival has disconcerted you .  --  Why Harry , David , how crestfallen you appear . HARRY DOWNRIGHT Mr. Richard , this has been an infamous vile plot to entrap us . DAVID DOWNRIGHT Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman from you . TOMPKINS Mr. David , I am too old to think of such tomfoolery as duels . Is it my fault that you have shewn yourself in your true colours ? DAVID DOWNRIGHT Oh , defend yourself , sir ! you and Mr. Job there were in league to  --  to  --  to insult me . Exit in a rage , R. JOB . Poor David , he is vexed ! HARRY DOWNRIGHT Vexed ; I should think so . I shall not remain here with such a hypocrite , you have behaved shamefully , sir ! Exit angrily , R.
