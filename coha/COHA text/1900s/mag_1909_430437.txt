 | THE first great sovereign duty , a duty transcending all political fealty and partisan affiliation , is the duty of the Government to subserve the interests of the people . As the first duty of the head of the family is to safeguard the interests of the generation that is to succeed him , so the highest and most sacred duty of the Government is to conserve , not alone for the next generation , but for all future generations , undiminished , except so far as may be necessary for the present , the great resources of the country . I have no patience with the doctrine so often preached that we owe nothing to the future . This is not our country alone . It belongs to our children 's children . We have the right to use it , but not to destroy its use to them . Great Britain supposed that with her coal and iron she would be able to rule the markets of the world forever . Today her mills are empty . Her alms houses are filled to overflowing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iron . She must now go so deep into the bowels of the earth that the added expense of those two great products upon which she depends renders it impossible for her to produce at her old rates and her markets have left her . This is an answer to those who say , " Let each generation take care of itself . " Great Britain is in the position where we will be the moment we have exhausted our natural resources . I have heard the idea of our inexhaustible natural resources advanced ever since I can remember . It has been preached up to the present . Now , it has suddenly dawned upon us that those resources can last , at the best , but a few years more . The people most directly interested were the first to discover that there was a shortage . They began working , night and day , to get hold of all the available coal and oil and iron  | fields and all the great forests of the country . Too late we realized that our resources were about exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of a few for commercial profit . After we had denuded the old White Mountains of their forests , after we had destroyed the timber on the Appalachians , after the farms were being washed away and destroyed and fires had made deserts of this section , we realized our extravagance and a bill was introduced in Congress to reforest the mountain chains and restore the old conditions , at a cost to the Government not of millions , but of billions , of dollars . The most ardent protectionist believes that some articles should be upon the free list . Some believe that the greatest good to the greatest number demands that certain raw material should not be obliged to pay duty . I believe that the interests of all the American people demand that certain of our great resources , now being rapidly exhausted , should be conserved as long as possible by - allowing the free importation of like products ? that such a use of the free list means the highest national protection . In responding to the duty imposed upon it by the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular things . First , and superior to everything else , was the question of protection . Whatever was done must be done under the banner of protection . The second was that , where it was possible , we should revise downward , always maintaining a sufficient wall against foreign importations to protect the American manufacturer , the American farmer and the American laborer . The third duty was to raise a revenue sufficient to conduct the affairs of the Government when economically and properly administered . If freed from every other proposition , revising the . tariff downward would have been a very simple matter , to be disposed of in a short time . That method was indulged in in 1894 . We revised the tariff downward , and the result was instantaneous . Every industry in the United States immediately went downward . One-third of them went into the dust , never to revive again until the law was changed . The other two-thirds worried along in a crippled condition until a Republican administration was again put in power by the vote of the American people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of destitution from the Gulf to the boundary line , from ocean to ocean . Every industry in the country felt the depressing influence . Many highly protective duties are voted into a tariff bill on the theory that they are tariff for revenue only duties . Every tariff which operates to protect any industry from foreign competition is a protective tariff ? whether it be 5 per cent . ad valorem , or 50o per cent . There is no use in hiding behind the terms of it and calling it a tariff for revenue only . Every tariff is a tariff for revenue , and every tariff which protects is a protective tariff . But the policy of protection should be applied to all the American people , because we are all producers and we are all consumers , and the policy , properly administered , must help the producer on one side , who becomes the consumer on the other side . I have never found a policy of the . Government which helped one class , which did not also help the other classes of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any product is fixt by the demand in the field of consumption and not by its value in the field of production . If there are destitution and poverty in the field of consumption , high prices can not be obtained in the field of production . If the farmers of this country raise wheat for a home consumption which will take every bushel of it , they are far better off than if they have to force their product into foreign markets ? and I hope the time is not far distant when we will not export one bushel of grain or flour . On the other hand , if the farmer 's crop fails , or he obtains poor prices , he is just that much crippled in purchasing the products of the manufacturer , who suffers accordingly . So that a policy which deprives the manufacturer of protection and closes our mills , pauperizing one part of the population , causes the farmer to suffer just to the extent of the injury inflicted on the manufacturing class . It is important that this fact should he constantly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founda-  | tion of the doctrine of protection ; for there is a limit beyond which the principle of protection becomes a menace to the nation and where free trade should be applied as the highest form of real protection . ' The fundamental principles of protection are , first , the development of an industry which is capable of development . If , for any reason , an industry is incapable of development , there is no reason in the world for having a protective duty applied to it . If an industry has reached the limit of expansion and , by reason of the exhaustion of its raw material , is nearing a state of extinction , the principle of protection has no further application whatever to that industry . The second principle , is , that by the development and expansion of an industry there will ultimately follow a decreased cost to the consumer . The consumers of any one article must always greatly exceed the number of producers of that particular article , and a system which will continually compel the greater number to pay tribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unjust . The compensation to the consumer for paying more to the producer than he otherwise would , today , on account of protection , is that he will be called upon to pay a less price than he otherwise would , tomorrow . Protection is not applicable to an industry which does not respond to this rule . So far , in the history of protection , almost every industry has responded to this idea , resulting in such diminished cost to the consumer that today all of the comforts and nearly all of the luxuries are within the grasp of men and women of moderate earning capacity ; in other words , a given amount of labor produces more comforts and luxuries in America today than anywhere else , or ever before in the history of the world . This fact will be vividly brought home to us the moment that the result of any tariff revision is to crowd an industry out of existence . But whenever , by reason of the exhaustion of the raw material , the price must , of necessity , constantly increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated . The third great principle of protection is that it gives employment to our own people . But here. , again it can only be justified when the employment can be retained by the aid of protection . There is no economic gain even to the laborer in the individual industry , in a policy which decreases the opportunity for future employment by the increase of present employment . It is no principle of protection to sacrifice the future to the immediate present . So , from each and all of the principles of protection , the inevitable deduction is that no resources of the country which , when once utilized , can not be reproduced , and which are certain of exhaustion in a few years , should be protected against importations ; and no tariff should be levied on coal , oil , iron or timber , because such duties contravene every principle of the protective policy of the nation : First , because the production is incapable of expansion without corresponding exhaustion . Second , because as we near exhaustion , the values will necessarily increase and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employment of labor , the final and near result is to discontinue the employment of labor entirely . The iron , timber , coal and oil , in this country , are certain of exhaustion within a very short time , and the values will necessarily increase , instead of decrease , and the more we hasten the exhaustion by prohibiting importation , the more we hasten the ultimate result ? the entire discontinuance of labor upon those industries . Even at the present rate of consumption , which is rapidly increasing , our coal supply can not last over a hundred years , according to the best authorities ; the available iron ore not more than fifty years , the lumber supply not thirty years , the oil not more than from twenty to fifty years , according as new fields may be discovered in other parts of the country . Of course the complete extinction of these products will not occur , but it will he because the approaching exhaustion will send the prices so high that the American people will be forced to discover and utilize substitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will prevent the titter exhaustion of our forests , for example , within thirty years .  | The only limit to ascending prices will be the ability of the people to purchase . Few people , even among regular buyers , realize how lumber has increased in price , thru exhaustion , during the last few years . White pine , for instance , has risen all the way from 88 to 189 per cent . The cost of production has not increased , at most , 25 per cent. , and the tremendous difference largely reflects the diminishing supply and represents the increased profits either of the manufacturer or the original owner of the timber . But more important than the increasing cost to the consumer , irrespective of the tariff , is the loss to the nation of its forests . We are suddenly awakening to the threatened disaster and casting about for methods of restoration . But the forests were made by Nature , not by man , and in my opinion the law which governed in their creation must also govern in their re-creation . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish but little against the destruction which is going on . The only way on earth to keep our forests is to use from them only that which has attained its growth and preserve the rest from the ravages of fire and the more persistent ravages of the lumber interests . So intense is our natural inclination to meet what we assume to be our present needs , and to add to our wealth , that all the lessons of history , of every country of the world , seem to be of no avail . Great portions of Africa , once wooded , are now desert wastes . The same thing is happening in India and China . As the forests are denuded the floods are let loose and waste ? eternal waste ? is the penalty . The destruction of the timber : ands of the Adirondacks , the White Mountains , the Appalachians , has carried with it the destruction of millions of acres of rich farming lands . The Kansas River floods in 1903 destroyed $20 , - 000,000 worth of property and a hundred lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved to the forests of America . There are principles underlying the policy of protection from which we can never get away . Applying those principles to iron , coal , oil and lumber , we can find no basis for the application of the policy , because a duty retarding the importation of those products is in contravention of the fundamental principles of protection , and the free importation of tile products is the greatest safeguard and the highest protection to the nation . In other words , more important to the people of the United States than all other questions , is the conservation of our forests . We do not own in fee the territory constituting our country . We have only a life interest in these great resources , a right to use them , but no right to protect them out of existence , for the profit of the present generation . We can not justify ourselves in deforesting the American continent , with all the attendant evils . We can not justify ourselves in hastening the exhaustion of any of our natural resources for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed today ; but so far as the free list will aid in retarding this exhaustion , for the benefit even of those laborers , as well as for the just claims of posterity , every principle of real protection demands the free importation of these products .
