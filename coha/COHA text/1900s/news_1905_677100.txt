txt The President and Representative Townsend of Michigan to-day had a conference on the Railroad Rate bill , which will be urged on Con-cress . The general outline of the bill was gone over , and it was decided to have another conference to-morrow afternoon before putting the measure aside as perfected . Mr. Townsend is enthusiastic over the President 's attitude on rate legislation . " I found him , " said he , " as strong as ever for rate regulation . He told me he was in no way responsible for the reports that his attitude was different from what ' it was last year . On the contrary , he said . everybody would know on Dec. 4 just what he thought . He added that he did not see how it was necessary for him to declare himself any further . " The President was very busy , and asked me to call at 2:30 o'clock to-morrow afternoon , when he would have time to go over the whole subject with me . He did not go into details in regard to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . For my part , however , I am of the opinion that the bill of this year will be broadened and not narrowed . There has been some doubt as to its clearness in regard to refregirator cars , private cars , and terminal charges . Mr. Each and I thought we had covered these points , but we will see to it that there is no doubt next time . " The bill must provide for giving power to the Inter-State Commerce Commission to fix a new rate in place of one found to be unreasonable . That is the crux of the I whole situation . There must be given to the Inter-State Commerce Commission or some other commission the power to change rates  --  that is to say , when it finds . upon fair investigation and full hearing . that a rate Is had the commission should have the power to cancel that rate and substitute a fair one . If it received power merely to recommend such a substitution its recommends Lion never would be followed . ? " The only real fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is too conservative . It conserves the interests of the railroads at every point . We want a bill that will not Interfere with the holiest business of the railroads , but we want one that will prevent their overstepping the bounds . "
