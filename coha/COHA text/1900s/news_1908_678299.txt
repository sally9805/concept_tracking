txt Richard Croker gave out a statement early last evening in which he severely took to task the Rev. Dr. Stephen S. Wise , who at the Ethical Social League on Monday night characterized as " a night of shame for the city " the presence of twelve Supreme Court Justices at the dinner given by Andrew Freedman in Mr. Croker 's honor . Following Mr. Croker 's statement , Dr. Wise after midnight came out in even stronger denunciation of the impropriety of members of the judiciary and of the District Attorney of the county consorting with the former Tammany leader . " Under the Penal Code limitations are operative , which circumstance guarantees the safety of the honored guest of tile Monday banquet , but the moral code knows no such limitations , " says Dr. Wise , in his latest statement . Dr. Wise has been receiving many congratulatory letters and telegrams on his Tuesday night speech . One of his callers yesterday was R. Fulton Cutting , head of the Citizens ' Union and leader in many civic movements . Mr. Cutting told Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . Here is Dr. Wise 's statement , which he dictated and carefully revised before giving it to tile reporters : Dr. Wise Renews Ills Attack . " I have nothing to say in reply to Mr. Croker . I wish merely to bring home to the citizenship of New York the serious , ness of the political situation as it comes to light in the dinner tendered to Mr. Croker , at which ten Judges of the Supreme Court are said to have been present . " The citizens of New York are under obligations to Mr. Croker , who has rendered this city a real service . His return , amid the jubilations of his one-time followers and the adulation for their long-exiled hero , on the part of many representatives of the high judiciary , will serve to crystallize the rising revolt of all that is decent and clean In New York ( citizenship against the threatened renewal of the reign of Crokerism . " I can not put it too clearly that I believe the City of New York was betrayed on Monday by the Judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sustaining New York 's honor . There are two explanations to be offered for the presence of the judiciary at the dinner to 1Mr . Croker . Either the Judges are so lost to a sense of fitness as to be unable to ' realize the indecency of joining in a tribi ute of honor to Richard Croker , or else ? as I in charity wish to believe  --  they were not free to absent themselves from a function in honor of the man who had created them . Judges the flosses ' Creatures . " It is hut too true , as New York knows , that many of our Judges are the creatures of the political bosses . It is to the bosses that many of them owe their elevation to office , and it Is saddening to think that , the presence of the judiciary at the Croker dinner was in part payment for past favors and in lively expectation of favors to follow from the guest of the evening or his not unworthy successor . No decent , self-respecting citizen of New York can fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places on the bench of New York are dispensed by one who only a few years ago dispensed from the bar . " As long as the former chieftain of Tammany Hall was discreet and tactful enough to keep himself secluded on his transatlantic estate it would have been unseemly to single him out for public obloquy . Even to-day no one can find fault with the hero of Monday night 's feast . The condemnation of New York must be visited not upon him whose record is a part of our municipal history , but upon these trustees of the city 's honor whn violated their trust by unitedly doing honor to him whose name must ever be a byword for civic wrong and civic shame . No Llinitntions in Moral Code . " Under the Penal Code limitations are operative , which circumstance guarantees the safety of the honored guest of the Monday banquet , but the moral code knows no limitations .

" I have not always lived in the City of New York . I have lived in the Far West long enough to know that New York 's example in everything affecting the higher interests of the Nation is of decisive influence in shaping our National life . Hence I am York . n %orth y jhaeRalit ; euesnotf rtahlee oinnorihoefNew but I ern thinking as well of the moral life of tile whole Nation , which It is the privilege of our great city to shape to higher issues . " Croker 's Reply to Wise . In the statement given out earlier by Mr. Croker , he denied that Dr. Wise had any right to put him in the class with Tweed , and declared that with Samuel J. Tilden lie had done his best to help In the crusade which brought about Tweed 's downfall and imprisonment . Mr. Croker met the attack upon his fellow-diners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Club : " It is very temperate , " he remarked as he distributed the typewritten sheets among the reporters who called to interview him . Here Is the statement : " I do not know Dr. Wise . I understand that he was at one time a resident of this State , but has lived many years in Oregon , and returned here recently . He is evidently talking of things that he knows nothing about ; but it is none the less to be regretted that a rabbi should permit himself to be used as a political buffer to open the Republican campaign of 1309 . " I returned to America to visit my home and many dear friends here , to whom I am deeply attached . The dinner at which I was the guest , and which my friends honored me by attending , was purely a private function . Among those present were gentlemen who had been politically opposed to me while I was in power , but who are my friends , and , I hope , always will be . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am here as a visitor , and I had honed to be free from these political attacks under Cover . " ' I am sorry that Dr. Wise , in his attempt to create a sensation , has seen fit to try to deprive me of the gratification of meeting my friends . Either he makes a deliberate false statement or he is totally ignorant of the history of this city when he attempts to link my name with that of Tweed In an unfavorable light . I may remind him that since 1870 , when Tweed was deposed , and for over thirty years out of the thirty-eight years since then , Tammany Hall has been in control of the affairs of this , the greatest city in the world . I was prominently identified with that great leader , Samuel J. Tilden , in the overthrow of Tweed and the destruction of his power . " I am told that this proclivity of Dr. Wise to use the pulpit to exploit his political views caused him ( and I think justly ) to lose a place in a prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure . The American people do not want to see their churches and synagogues desecrated In exploiting any man 's political bias . " Several hours intervened between the publication of Rabbi Wise 's speech and the reporters ' visit to Mr. Croker , so the former Tammany leader had had abundant opportunity to cool off . He presented an unruffled front to his interviewers , though in discussing Dr. R'ise 's utterances , he plainly showed that they had irritated him . Mr. Croker made incidentally , yesterday , the first admission since he landed that he is taking any interest in politics . One of the reporters called his attention to Dr. Wise 's remark that the Freedman dinner v-as a get-together affair preparatory to the Mayorality campaign , and for this reason it was higi. time for the friends of good government to get together , too . " Good , " said Mr. Croker , " the rabbi Is right there . If I could strengthen the hands of my party ; if I could do anything to make them drop their differences and to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater pleasure . I do n't want this interpreted , though , as an intimation that I am taking or intend to take active part in politics again . I am out of it for good . " District Attorney Jerome created the real sensation at the Freedman dinner by his praise of Mr. Croker and his denunciation of the present leadership of the Democratic Party here . A TIRES reporter asked Mr. Jerome yesterday to elaborate on these after-dinner remarks . " I have nothing whatever to say regarding that , " was his reply . " It was a private dinner . Some guest was guilty of a gross bleach of etiquette by giving out for publication a somewhat twisted - version of some of the speeches , including mine . But thatis no reason why I should commit a similar indiscretion or violation of fundamental social ethics . I have nothing to say . " ? Mr. Jerome , " said Tgg TIRES reporter , " in some quarters it has been intimated that your speech heralded a willingness on your part to become regular again and climb on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year . " Mr. Jerome laughed harshly . " I am unwilling to discuss that and for the same reason , but you knew me well enough to draw your inferences . " " Would you be a candidate for Mayor lf the nomination was offered you ? " he was asked . This time Mr. Jerome tilted his chair back , puffed at his cigarette , looked at the ceiling with a far-off gaze , and begged to be excused from replying  --  all with the air of a man who had just terted to the best joke he had heard for some time . Friends of Mr. Jerome who sometimes say for him what he would , not say for himself , declare that he I would n't be a candidate for Mayor if a certificate of election and four years ' salary in advance were handed on a silver salver to him with the nomination .
