txt Judge Remarking on " Unreasonable Construction Which Leaves No Protection Against . Appropriation of News . Judge Learned ' Hand , I sitting in thei United States District Court , yesterday afternoon , dissolved the injunction he had ! issued on Thursday night restraining The New York Sun and The New York World from reprinting from The London Times Commander Peary 's copyrighted dispatches . to THE NEW YORK TIMES scribing his discovery of " the north The- failure of ; this . attempt to PrOtCdt Commander Peary 's interest in the finan-. dal proceeds of his achievement was due ? to ' a : technicality in- the contract-made ' by THE NEB- YORK TIMES with Commander ' Peary on. - July 6 , was . ? . - . . Upon . this contract With Corrimander . Peary the issue quined " . - Yesterday. after- noon ; after Judge Hand- had declared- in the morning that if THE TIMES were shown to be technically within its rights he would grant the injunction to prevent the reprinting of the Peary dispatches unless - the newspapers it was sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further infringements . With Peary . The contract itself was produced and read as follows : July 6 , 1908 . ? NEW YORK . TIMES , New York City . Gentlemen : I herewith ackowledge the receipt of the sum of Your thousand dollars ( $4,000 ) . from THE NEW YORK TIMES on behalf of itself and associates . It is ' understood that in making this advance THE TIMES does not assume any responsibility for or any connection with the expedition on which I am about to embark . and which has for its purpose the finding of the north pole . The money is advanced to me es a loan to be repaid to THE NEW YORK TIMES and its associates out-of the proceeds of the news and literary rights ? resulting from this expedition , it being understood that if any reason the exPedition is abandrred before ' the Fall of 1908 the money is to . be reunded to TEE TIMES . If the expedition is successful and the pole is discovered . I promise to use - every means in. my power to reach civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discovery over my ? Um signature . THE TIMES is to have the Sole rights . to the news-of-the discovery , and is to have the exclusive right of its publication in all parts of the world . My .. understanding is that ' ' ' , ' HE TIMES on its part agrees to syndicate the ne3vs both in Europe and America , and to give to me the entire amount it receives after deducting costs of cable tolls- , &c.; THE TIMES and its associates will pay me what they consider a reasonable amgunt for the use of the material In their own publications . From the sum thus raised the $4,000 is to be repaid , and I am free to sell the magazine and book rights to my best advantage . It is understood , however , that should the news reports by any possibility not realize the sum of $4,000 , an ? deficit will be reimbursed to THE TIMES from the magazine and book rights . Should the expedition not be successful ' in finding the pole , but should simply result in explorations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaid $4,000 out of the news , magazine , and book rights of . the expedition , ? so far as they may go toward the liquidation of that claim . Yours very truly , R. E. PEARY . It may be stated that the sum realized for the Peary dispatches has been greatly in excess of the amount advanced to Commander Peary . Judge Rand 's Decision . Judge Hand 's decision makes clear the ground on which he decided to dissolve the injunction . Here it is : At the time when the injunction was granted the complainants had attempted to , acquire a.copyright by the publication of a pamphlet with notice of copyright , and had mailed the requisite copies to the Librarian of Congress . Had the complainants received from Lieut . Peary the right to publish the story of this discovery in pamphlet form the copyright wouid have been perfected by these acts . The contract gave to them , however , - only the right to a news publication of the story , which I understand to mean that they meant to publish it in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , the antecedent publication of a pamphlet was not the publication which the statute requires , for that must be p. publication by the proprietor . Assuming that Lieut . Peary could , in fact , split up his rights , as to which I decide nothing , he had not given . to . the complainant any magazine or book rights which I can conceive to include pamphlets . This publication must follow their title , and until they published in a newspaper I can not think they published as required by the statute . I should be disposed to stretch , the reading of the contract , in so far as in justice I might , to protect the- complainant , but I can not construe this pamphlet as in any sense . a. newspaper without a clear perversion of the parties ' meaning . The Sun to Reprint No More . " When the case had been closed James M. Beck , - as attorney for The Sun , stated . in court that his client would not reprint from London h.ny more of the- Peary dispatches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to that ' . decision , " said ' Judge Hand . The tifternoon 's argument was entirely devoted , to a discussion of the construe : tion of the Peary ' contract . Mr. ' Beck declared at the opening of the sessicin that , after , reading it he was more than ever disposed to press for the dismissal of the preliminary injunction , which had been granted after The ' Sun and World had reprinted verbatim , from London . Commander Peary 's summary of his journey , which appeared in THE TIMES on Sept. 0 . Mr. Beck declared that the complaint was , disingenuneiin-asserting that Commander Peary had contracted to furnish an exclusiveaccOunt of his doings to THE Tans and its associates , in view of the reservation of the book rights . All the contract contemplated , Mr. Beck argued , was to give THE TimEs a " scoop " on the news , and he suggested that if Peary knew to-day of the controversy which had been aroused by the claims of Dr. Cook he would want to have his story given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' impress me , " remarked Judge Hand , " but this thing does impress . - me , namely , that they have attempted to get their copyright in the form of a book , whereas the book rights under the contract are reserved to Pearva ? Judge Hand said he would like to hear argument on this point , and A. A. Cook of Leventritt , Cook &; Nathan , counsel for , THE TIMES , replied . Only Protection to Peary Sought . . " This contract , " said he , " must be construed as a whole.and with reference ' to its entire meaning . Every penny that THE TIMES gets through the publication of these - articles goes back to Commander Peary after THE Tierss is reim- I horsed for its $4000 loan . The steps which have been taken were all ' taken to protect Commander Peary 's interests in connection with the efforts of THE TratEs as his agent to syndicate this news to other newspapers around the country . " Now The Sun and The World syndicate news for their own profit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect Commander Peary against their attempt ' to take these dispatches , which are a part of the value coming to him from his great achievement , and sell them for their own profit and to his loss . " Judge Hand remarked at this point that Mr. Beck 's contention applied only to the I present injunction , and that subsequent publications could- he protected by copy-rights obtained on the basis of . newspaper publication . " But , " replied Emil Goidmark. who appeared with Mr. Cook , " if we copyrighted the whole newspaper we would leave the way open for any one to filch the Peary dispatches through The London Times . I contend that the contract should be construed with reference to its plain intent , and that we should be left free to I take the necessary legal steps to protect Commander Pear : ' . " Judge Criticises the Defense . " Is n't it a rather narrow and unreasonable construction , " asked Judge Hand , turning to Mr. Beck , " which does not leave to these Complainants a particle of protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well . " replied Mr. Beck , Peary and ! THE TRIES ' made that contract , and if ft1 is unfortunate , or even improvident , H nevertheless stands as a contract and reserves to Peary the book rights . " Judge Hand was finally disposed to ! agree with this view . a If . the informality of the contract " ; he said , has the effect of defeating Its ; purpose , still the court Will not read into , it provisions which will violate rights that ' appear to have been reserved . L'ut , I am not going to let you , or any one ! else , take the right of injunction away , from them if I find that they have I grounds on which to claim the protection ! of a copyright . " Judge Hand sungested that the case ! might ' be met by the publication . of an advance copy of the paper containing the dispatches and the copyright of- - Such and issue , but that , he . said , ' . Was a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session of the argument Mr : Beck , who spoke for both the respondents , devoted his- time ? to the presentation of another theory : .  --  ? - " If , the theory on which this application is made is pushed to its logical conclusion , " said Mr. Beck , " then one- of the most important facts in the history of the World can be kept ; : rorrt all mankind except , such as may read , . THE NEW Yonit Turns and the London Times . For It Peary 's summary - of ' his experience is covered as published an . Sept. 9 , by the copyright law , - every- fact contained in that summary is so covered , inasmuch as the summary itself is a statement of fact so simple ' that to repeat any part of It involves substantially the use of the same language . " " So Peary 's great achievement , which has excited the admiration of the entire world , can be kept from the world.except such part of it as reads THE NEW YonX TIMES and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Peary chose not to communicate the fact elsewhere and THE TIMES chose not to give ' It publicity , this discovery of the North Pole itself by an officer of the United States Navy engaged in official business and paid by every taxpayer . can be kept from the whole world ? ' Judge Hand was disposed to dissent from this Idea of the situation . He called attention to the fact that Peary 's telegrams to various individuals , to THE TIMES and to The Associated Press , making known the essential fact of his discovery had received the widest publicity . The account of Peary 's travels , said Judge Hand , was in a sense a . literary production  --  and literary property ; its substance the court did not consider to ' be such . Hence the essential facts might be stated so long as the language or a colorable paraphrase of the language were not employed . This , Judge Hand said , he considered to he the attitude of THE TIMES . Other Means of Protection . Mr. Beck replied that the Copyright act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for infringements , namely , $1 for each infringing ' copy of the copyright , ' and that in view of the solvency of the respondents in the injunction action , and the fact that the injury inflicted on them by an injunction improperly issued was just as severe as tile injury . upon tile petitioner through the lack of an injunciton , he did Lot believe that THE Times ought to come into an equity court and ask for the form of relief sought in the present case . " Another . fact , " said Mr. Beck , " to which I desire to call your Honor 's attention is that if instead of filing this bill in equity and tossing lit into the office of The Sun at 3 o'clock this morning , serving it on a mailing clerk , THE TIMES had consulted the editor of The Sun yesterday It could have obtained a. perfectly clear statement of The Sun 's intention in the matter . " Mr. Cook took a hand at this point , to say that the day before he had sent a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to The ASS ? - , elated Press , callingg attention to the plan of THE TIMES of publishing the Peary dispatches and . the terms upon which publication might be obtained by outside publications . ' nTo these letters no an , swers were received . Mr. Cook said also that on Thursday he wrote letters to both The World and The Sun and to their attorneys calling attention to the infringement of the copyright . Mr. Beck then replied tnat the thing which THE TIMES wrote about originally , as he conceived it , was the , story that began yesterday morning , and not the suminary . Had Mr. Ochs or MraMiller called ' hpeither The Sun or The World and asked if we were going to publish the actual installment of the narrative we would have told him , and I call your Honor 's ' - ' attention in this connection to the fact that we did not publish the installment that appeared this morning , although when the paper went to press they knew nothing of this suit . " " Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the issuance of an injunction if you do not intend to publish the articles. , Mr. Beck said he did object , because the.issuance of the injunction implied that there were causes on account of which an injunction ought to issue , whereas as a matter of- , fact he did not think that such causes existed .
