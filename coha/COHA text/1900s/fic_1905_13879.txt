Interior of Philip Jordan 's cabin in southern Arizona , on a late afternoon in spring . A large room rudely built , adorned with blankets , pottery , weapons , and sacred images of the local Indian tribes , and hung with trophies of the chase , together with hunting-knives , saddles , bridles , nose-bags for horses , lariats , and other paraphernalia of frontier life . Through a long low window at the back the desert is seen , intensely colored , and covered with the uncouth shapes of giant cacti , dotted with bunches of gorgeous bloom . The entrance door is on the left ( from the spectator 's standpoint ) , in a projecting elbow of the room ; farther to the left is a door leading to the sleeping-quarters . On the right is a cook-stove , a cupboard for dishes and household utensils , and a chimney-piece , over which hangs a bleached cow's-skull supporting a rifle . At a rude table in the centre sits Philip Jordan , a man of thirty-four , mending a bridle . Polly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her packing by Winthrop Newbury , a recent graduate of an Eastern medical college . Ruth Jordan , Philip 's sister , a girl of nineteen , stands at the window looking out . NEWBURY As he hands the last articles to PollyWhat on earth possessed you to bring such a load of duds to Arizona ? p. 3 POLLY They promised me a good time , meaning one small shindig  --  one  --  in the three months I 've spent in this unholy place . Philip makes an impatient movement with the bridle ; speaks gruffly PHILIP You 'd better hurry . It 's getting late . RUTH From the windowIt 's getting cooler , which is more to the point . We can make the railroad easily by sunrise , with this delicious breeze blowing . POLLY Gives the finishing touches to the trunk and locks the lidThere , at last ! Heaven help the contents . PHILIP Gruffly , as he risesGive me a lift with the trunk , Win . They carry the trunk outside . Polly , with the aid of a cracked mirror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pollikins ! You 'll be the talk of all the jack rabbits and sage hens between here and the railroad . POLLY Phil is furious at me for going , and it is rather mean to sneak off for a visit in a grand house in San Francisco , when you poor dears have to slave on here . But really , I ca n't endure this life a day longer . RUTH It is n't in nature that you should . Fancy that she indicates Polly with a grandiose gesturenourishing itself on salt-pork , chickory beans , and airtight ! p. 4 POLLY Do you really mean to say that apart from your pride in helping your brother , making the project go , and saving the family fortunes , you really enjoy yourself here ? RUTH Since Phil and I came out , one day has been more radiantly exciting than the other . I do n't know what 's the matter with me . I think I shall be punished for being so happy . POLLY Punished for being happy ! There 's your simon-pure New-Englander . RUTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garret , perusing " The Twelve Pillars and Four Cornerstones of a Godly Life . " POLLY Pointing at Ruth 's heart , speaks with mock solemnityIf Massachusetts and Arizona ever get in a mix-up in there , woe be !  --  Are you ever going to have that coffee done ? RUTH I hope soon , before you get me analyzed out of existence . POLLY As Ruth busies herself at the stoveThe main point is this , my dear , and you 'd better listen to what the old lady is a-tellin ' of ye . Happiness is its own justification , and it 's the sacreder the more unreasonable it is . It comes or it does n't , that 's all you can say about it . And when it comes , one has the sense to grasp it or one has n't . There you have the Law and the Prophets . Winthrop and Philip enter from outside . Ruth , who has set out the coffee and sandwiches on the table , bows elaborately , with napkin over arm p. 5 RUTH Messieurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an all-night ride in the desert ahead of us . They drink their coffee , Philip standing sullenly apartWhere do we get our next feed ? RUTH With luck , at Cottonwood Wash . NEWBURY And how far may Cottonwood Wash be ? RUTH Thirty miles . NEWBURY SarcasticallyLocal measurement ? POLLY Poking PhilipPhil , for Heaven 's sake say something . You diffuse the gloom of the Pit . PHILIP I 've had my say out , and it makes absolutely no impression on you . POLLY It 's the impression on the public I 'm anxious about . PHILIP The public will have to excuse me . POLLY I am horribly sorry for you two poor dears , left alone in this dreadful place . When Dr. Newbury goes , I do n't see how you 'll support life . I should like to know how long this sojourn in the wilderness is going to last , anyhow . During the following , Ruth takes a candle from the shelf , lights it , and brings it to the table . The sunset glow has begun to fade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NEWBURY And how long will that be ? RUTH Counts on her fingersTwo years to pay back the money we raised on mother 's estate , two years of invested profits , two years of hard luck and marking time , two years of booming prosperity . Say eight years ! POLLY Shades of the tomb ! How long do you expect to live . RUTH Forever ! The sound of a galloping horse is heard , muffled by the sand NEWBURY Listen . What 's that ? A boy of fifteen , panting from his rapid ride , appears at the open door PHILIP Rising and going toward the doorWhat 's the matter ? BOY I 've come for the doctor . PHILIP Who wants a doctor ? BOY Your man Sawyer , over to Lone Tree .  --  He 's broke his leg . RUTH Broken his leg ! Sawyer ? Our foreman ? PHILIP There 's a nice piece of luck !  --  How did it happen ? BOY They was doin ' some Navajo stunts on horseback , pullin ' chickens out of the sand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sawyer 's horse renigged , and lunged off agin a ' dobe wall . Smashed his leg all to thunder . Winthrop looks vaguely about for his kit and travelling necessaries , while Polly gives the boy food , which he accepts shyly as he goes outside with Philip . Ruth has snatched saddle and bridle from their peg p. 7 RUTH I 'll have Buckskin saddled for you in a jiffy . How long will it take you to set the leg ? NEWBURY Perhaps an hour , perhaps three . RUTH It 's a big detour , but you can catch us at Cottonwood Wash by sunrise , allowing three hours for Sawyer . Buckskin has done it before . She goes out POLLY PoutingThis will spoil all our fun ! Why ca n't the creature wait till you get back ? NEWBURY Did you ever have a broken leg ? POLLY Well , no , not exactly a leg . But I 've had a broken heart ! In fact , I 've got one now , if you 're not going with us . NEWBURY To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PauseDid you ever dream of climbing a long hill , and having to turn back before you saw what was on the other side ? Polly nods enthusiasticallyI feel as if I 'd had my chance to-night to see what was over there , and lost it . POLLY You 'll excuse me if it sounds personal , Dr. Newbury , but did you expect to discern a  --  sort of central figure in the outrolled landscape ? NEWBURY Embarrassed , repenting of his sentimental outburstNo . That is  --  p. 8 POLLY With a sweep of her armO , I see . Just scenery ! She laughs and goes into the inner room , left . Ruth reenters . The sky has partly faded and a great full moon begins to rise RUTH Buckskin is ready , and so is the moon . The boy knows the trails like an Indian . He will bring you through to Cottonwood by daylight . NEWBURY Taking heartWe shall have the ride back together , at any rate . RUTH Yes .  --  I would go with you , and try to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't another horse that can do the distance . She holds out her handGoodbye . NEWBURY Detaining her handWo n't you make it up to me ? He draws her toward him RUTH Gently but firmlyNo , Win . Please not . NEWBURY Never ? RUTH Life is so good just as it is ! Let us not change it . He drops her hand , and goes out , without looking back . Polly reenters . The women wave Winthrop good-bye POLLY Takes Ruth by the shoulders and looks at her severelyConscience clear ? p. 9 RUTH Humoring herCrystal ! POLLY Counts on her fingersPromising young physician , charming girl , lonely ranch , horseback excursions , spring of the year ! RUTH Not guilty . POLLY Gracious ! Then it 's not play , it 's earnest . RUTH Neither the one nor the other . It 's just your little blonde romantic noddle . She takes Polly 's head between her hands and shakes it as if to show its emptinessDo you think if I wanted to flirt , I would select a youth I 've played hookey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Win ! He 's so good , so gentle and chivalrous . But  --  With a movement of lifted arms , as if for airah me , he 's  --  finished ! I want one that is n't finished ! POLLY Are you out of your head , you poor thing ? RUTH You know what I mean well enough . Winthrop is all rounded off , a completed product . But the man I sometimes see in my dreams is  --  Pausing for a simile --  well , like this country out here , do n't you know  --  ? She breaks off , searching for words , and makes a vague outline in the air , to indicate bigness and incompletion p. 10 POLLY DrilyYes , thank you . I do know ! Heaven send you joy of him ! RUTH Heaven wo n't , because , alas , he does n't exist ! I am talking of a sublime abstraction  --  of the glorious unfulfilled  --  of the West  --  the Desert . POLLY Lifts Ruth 's chin , severelyWe have n't by chance , some spring morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the merest chance beheld a sublime abstraction  --  say in blue overalls and jumper ? Ruth shakes her headHonest ? More emphatic head-shaking . Polly drops Ruth 's chin with a shrug of the shoulders . Philip enters RUTH Putting on her riding-hatIs Pinto saddled ? PHILIP Pinto is gone . RUTH AstonishedGone where ? PHILIP To that Mexican blow-out over at Lone Tree . Every man-jack on the ranch has disappeared , without leave asked or notice given , except this paper which I just found nailed to the factory door . Ruth takes the note and reads it anxiously . Then she slowly removes her hat and lays it awayWhat are you up to now ? We 've no time to lose ! p. 11 RUTH With quiet determinationI am not going . POLLY As Philip turns in surpriseNot going ? RUTH I must stay and look after the ranch . PHILIP O , come , that 's out of the question ! RUTH We have put all mother 's money into this venture . We ca n't take any risks . PHILIP The men will be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your staying here all alone . POLLY Seats herself with decisionOne thing is certain : either Ruth goes or I stay . PHILIP Takes off his hat and sets down the provision basketThat suits me perfectly ! POLLY HystericalBut I ca n't stay ! I wo n't stay ! I shall go mad if I spend another night in this place . RUTH No , you must n't stay . You would never get us worked up to the point of letting you go , another time . She lifts Polly , and with arm around her waist leads her to the door PHILIP I refuse to leave you here alone , just to satisfy a whim of Polly 's . That 's flat ! p. 12 RUTH But , Phil , you forget the stores you 're to fetch back . They will be dumped out there on the naked sand , and by to-morrow night  --  She blows across her palm , as if scattering thistledown PHILIP Well , what of it ? A few hundred dollars ' worth of stuff ! RUTH A few hundred dollars means sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's poor Sawyer . He 'll be brought back here to-morrow , and nobody to nurse him . Then inflammation , fever , and good-bye Sawyer . Philip , with a gesture of accepting the inevitable , picks up the grain-sacks and basket POLLY At the door , embracing RuthGood-bye , dear . Are n't you really afraid to stay ? RUTH I 'm awfully sorry to miss the fun , but as for danger , the great Arizona Desert is safer than Beacon Hill . POLLY You 're sure ? RUTH If marauders prowl , I 'll just fire the blunderbuss out the window , and they wo n't stop running this side of the Great Divide . POLLY Kissing herGood-bye , dear . RUTH Good-bye . Polly goes out p. 13 PHILIP Pausing beside Ruth , at the doorMind you put out the light early . It can be seen from the Goodwater Trail . There 's no telling what riff-raff will be straggling back that way after the dance . RUTH Riff-raff ! They 're my sworn knights and brothers . PHILIP In that case , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property ! That 's different . PHILIP Well , you mind what I say and put out the light . RUTH Yours for prudence ! She puts her arm around his waist and draws him to her , kissing him tenderlyGood-bye , Phil . He kisses her and starts to go . She still detains him . When she speaks again , her voice is softened and awedWhat a lovely night ! Who would ever think to call this a desert , this moonlit ocean of flowers ? What millions of cactus blooms have opened since yesterday ! PHILIP Looking at her dubiouslyWhat 's the matter with you to-night ? RUTH Nothing . Everything . Life !  --  I do n't know what 's got into me of late . I 'm just drunk with happiness the whole time . PHILIP Well , you 're a queer one .  --  Good-bye . I shall get back as soon as horseflesh will do it . He goes out p. 14 RUTH As the rumble of the wagon is heardGood-bye ! Good-bye , Pollikins ! Good-bye ! She takes the candle from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then raises the light in one hand and waves her handkerchief with the other . She sets the candle again on the table , goes to the mantel-shelf , and takes down a photographDear Win ! I forgot how disappointed you were going to be . Pause , during which she still gazes at the pictureClear , kind heart ! After a moment she replaces it brusquely on the mantel-shelf , and raises her arms above her head with a deep breath . She stands thus , with arms crossed behind her head , looking at the photograph . Her gaze becomes amused and mischievous ; she points her finger at the picture and whispers mockinglyFinished ! Finished ! She begins to prepare for bed , taking down her hair , and re-coiling it loosely during the following . She hums a tune vaguely and in snatches , then with a stronger rhythm ; at last she singsHeart , wild heart , Brooding apart , Why dost thou doubt , and why art thou sullen ? Flower and birdWait but thy word  --  She breaks off , picks up a photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment in silencePoor little mother ! You look out at me with such patient , anxious eyes . There are better days coming for you , and it 's troublesome me that 's bringing them . Only you trust me ! A man 's face appears at the edge of the window , gazing stealthily in . As Ruth turns , he disappears . She lays down the picture and sings againThis is the hour , And thine is the power.Heart , high heart , be brave to begin it.Dare you refuse ? Think what we lose ! Think what we gain  - -  The words grow indistinct as she takes up the candle and passes into the other room , from which her voice sounds from time to time in interrupted song . The man again appears , shading his face with a peaked Mexican hat so as to see into the darkened room . He turns and waves his hand as if signalling distant persons to approach , then enters through the open door . He looks cautiously about the room , tip-toes to the inner door and listens , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , beckoning . Ruth reenters , carrying the candle . She is shod in moccasins , and clad in a loose , dark sleeping-dress , belted at the waist , with wide , hanging sleeves and open throat . As she crosses to the table she sings Heart which the coldLong did enfold  - -  Hark , from the dark eaves the night thaw drummeth ! Now as a god , Speak to the sod , Cry to the sky that the miracle cometh ! She passes her hand over a great bunch of wild flowers on the tableBe still , you beauties ! You 'll drive me to distraction with your color and your odor . I 'll take a hostage for your good behavior.She selects a red flower , puts it in the dark mass of her hair , and looks out at the open doorWhat a scandal the moon is making , out there in that great crazy world ! Who but me could think of sleeping on such a night ? She sits down , folds the flowers in her arms , and buries her face in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes hurriedly to the door , and peers out . She then shuts and bolts the door , draws the curtains before the window , comes swiftly to the table , and blows out the light . The room is left in total darkness . There are muttering voices outside , the latch is tried , then a heavy lunge breaks the bolt . A man pushes in , but is hurled back by a taller man , with a snarling oath . A third figure advances to the table , and strikes a match . As soon as the match is lighted Ruth levels the gun , which she has taken from its rack above the mantel . There is heard the click of the hammer , as the gun misses fire . It is instantly struck from her hand by the first man ( Dutch ) who attempts to seize her . She evades him , and tries to wrest a pistol from a holster on the wall . She is met by the second man ( Shorty ) who frustrates the attempt , pocketing the weapon . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has been fumbling with the lamp , which he has at last succeeded in lighting . All three are dressed in rude frontier fashion ; the one called Shorty is a Mexican half-breed , the others are Americans . Ghent is younger than Dutch , and taller , but less powerfully built . All are intoxicated , but not sufficiently so to incapacitate them from rapid action . The Mexican has seized Ruth and attempts to drag her toward the inner room . She breaks loose , and flies back again to the chimney-place , where she stands at bay . Ghent remains motionless and silent by the table , gazing at her p. 15 DUTCH Uncorking a whiskey flaskPlucky little catamount . I drink its health . Drinks RUTH What do you want here ? DUTCH Laughs , with sinister relishDid you hear that , Steve ? He drinks again , and reaches out the flask to RuthTake one , and pull in its purty little claws , eh ? Jolly time . No more fuss and fury . Ruth reaches for a knife , hidden behind the elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seizes her in his armsPeppery little devil ! With desperate strength she breaks from his clutch and reels from him in sickness of horror . Ghent remains gazing at her in a fascinated semi-stupor . Meanwhile , after closing the door , the Mexican has taken dice from his pocket , and , throwing them into a small vase on the table , shakes them and holds out the vase to Dutch . He takes it and turns to Ghent ; the latter has moved a step or two toward Ruth , who in her retreat has reached the chimney-piece and stands at bay DUTCH Come , get into the game , curse you , Steve ! This is going to be a free-for-all , by God ! As he rattles the dice , Ruth makes a supplicating gesture to Ghent RUTH Save me ! save me ! Her gesture is frozen by his advancing towards her . She looks wildly about , shrinking from him , then with sudden desperate resolution speaksSave me , and I will make it up to you ! Ghent again advances ; she goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! Listen ! Save me from these others , and from yourself , and I will pay you  --  with my life . p. 16 GHENT With dull wonderWith  --  your life ? RUTH With all that I am or can be . GHENT What do you mean ?  --  PauseYou mean you 'll go along with me out of this ? Stick to me  --  on the square ? RUTH In a tragic whisperYes . GHENT On the dead square ? RUTH Yes . GHENT You wo n't peach , and spoil it ? RUTH No . Pause , during which he looks at her fixedly GHENT Give me your hand on it ! She gives him her hand . The other men , at the table , have drawn their weapons , and hold them carelessly , but alert to the slightest suspicious movement on the part of Ghent DUTCH As Ghent turns to themShorty and me 's sittin ' in this game , and interested , eh , Shorty ? The Mexican nods . Ghent comes slowly to the table , eyeing the two . Dutch holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shake how ? DUTCH Any damn way ! Sole and exclusive rights . License to love and cherish on the premises ! Ghent takes the vase , shakes the dice meditatively , is about to throw , then sets the vase down . He searches through his pockets and produces a few bills and a handful of silver , which he lays on the table p. 17 GHENT There 's all I 've got in my clothes . Take it , and give me a free field , will you ? DUTCH Leaning over the table to Ghent , in plaintive remonstranceYou do n't mean me , Steve ! GHENT To the MexicanWell , you , then ! The Mexican spreads the money carelessly with his left hand to ascertain its amount , then thrusts it away with a disgusted grunt of refusal DUTCH Do n't blame you , Shorty ! A ornery buck of a dirt-eatin ' Mojave 'd pay more'n that for his squaw . Ruth covers her face shudderingly . Ghent stands pondering , watching the two men under his brows , and slowly gathering up the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt , and unwinds from his neck a string of gold nuggets in the rough , strung on a leather thread GHENT Well , it ai n't much , that 's sure . But there 's a string of gold nuggets I guess is worth some money . He throws it on the table , speaking to both menTake that , and clear out . DUTCH Draws up angrily I 've give you fair warning ! GHENT We 'll keep everything friendly between me and you . A square stand-up shoot , and the best man takes her . p. 18 DUTCH MollifiedNow you 're comin ' to ! GHENT To the MexicanThen it 's up to you , and you 'd better answer quick ! THE MEXICAN Eyeing Ghent and Ruth , points to the gun lying on the floorI take him , too . GHENT No , you do n't . You leave everything here the way you found it . THE MEXICAN Alla right . He pockets the chain and starts for the door GHENT Hold on a minute . You 've got to promise to tie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Mesa Grande . Bargain ? The Mexican nodsAnd mouth shut , mind you , or  --  He makes a sign across his throat THE MEXICAN NodsAlla right . He goes out GHENT Motioning toward the doorOutside . DUTCH SurprisedWhat for ? GHENT SternlyOutside ! They move toward the door . Dutch stops and waves his hand to Ruth p. 19 DUTCH Do n't worry , my girl . Back soon . GHENT ThreateninglyCut that out ! DUTCH What 's eatin ' you ? She ai n't yours yet , and I guess she wo n't be , not till hell freezes over . He taps his pistol and goes out . Ghent picks up the rifle which has previously missed fire ; he unloads it , throws it on the window-seat , and follows Dutch . Ruth stands beside the table , listening . Four shots are heard . After a short time Ghent appears and watches from the door the vanishing horses . He comes to the table opposite Ruth RUTH In a low voiceIs he dead ? GHENT No ; but he 'll stay in the coop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ghent seats himself at the other side of the table , draws a whiskey flask from his pocket , and uncorks it awkwardly , using only his right hand RUTH As he is about to drinkDo n't ! GHENT Lowers the bottle and looks at her in a dazed wayIs this on the square ? RUTH I gave you my promise . Gazing at her , he lets the bottle sink slowly by his side ; the liquor runs out , while he sits as if in a stupor . Ruth glances toward the door , and half starts from her seat , sinking back as he looks up p. 20 GHENT Give me a drink of water . She brings the water from a bucket in the corner . He sets the empty bottle on the table , drinks deeply of the water , takes a handkerchief from his neck , wets it , and mops his face GHENT Where are your folks ? RUTH My brother has gone out to the rail-road . GHENT Him and you ranching it here by yourselves ? RUTH Yes . GHENT Write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ink before herFix it up anyway you like . RUTH Tell me first what you mean to do with me . GHENT Ponders awhile in silenceHave you got a horse to ride ? RUTH Yes . GHENT We can reach San Jacinto before sun-up . Then we 're off for the Cordilleras . I 've got a claim tucked away in them hills that 'll buy you the city of Frisco some day , if you have a mind to it ! She shrinks and shuddersWhat you shivering at ? Ruth does not answer , but begins to write . Ghent , still using only one hand , takes a pistol from his pocket , examines it , and lays it carelessly on the table , within Ruth 's reach . He rises and goes to the fireplace , takes a cigarette from his pocket and lights it , and examines the objects on the mantel-shelf . Ruth stops writing , takes up the pistol , then lays it down , as he speaks without turning aroundRead what you 've written . Ruth , about to read , snatches up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresoluteWhy do n't you shoot ? He turns around deliberatelyYou promised on the square , but there 's nothing square about this deal . You ought to shoot me like a rattlesnake ! p. 21 RUTH I know that . GHENT Then why do n't you ? RUTH SlowlyI do n't know . GHENT I guess you 've got nerve enough , for that or anything .  --  Answer me ; why not ? RUTH I do n't  --  know .  --  You laid it there for me.  --  And  --  you have no right to die . GHENT How 's that ? RUTH You must live  --  to pay for having spoiled your life . GHENT Do you think it is spoiled ? RUTH Yes . GHENT And how about your life ? RUTH I tried to do it . GHENT To do what ? RUTH To take my life . I ought to die . I have a right to die . But I can not , I can not ! I love my life , I must live . In torment , in darkness  --  it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! She drops the weapon on the table , pushes it toward him , and covers her eyesTake it away ! Do n't let me see it . If you want me on these terms , take me , and may God forgive you for it ; but if there is a soul in you to be judged , do n't let me do myself violence . She sinks down by the table , hiding her face in her handsO , God have pity on me ! Ghent puts the pistol back into his belt , goes slowly to the outer door , opens it , and stands for some moments gazing out . He then closes the door , and takes a step or two toward the table . As he speaks , Ruth 's sobs cease , she raises her head and looks strangely at him p. 22 GHENT I 've lived hard and careless , and lately I 've been going down hill pretty fast . But I have n't got so low yet but what I can tell one woman from another . If that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here by now , riding like hell for liquor to wash the taste of shame out of my mouth . But that ai n't all . I 've seen what I 've been looking the world over for , and never knew it .  --  Say your promise holds , and I 'll go away now . RUTH O , yes , go , go ! You will be merciful . You will not hold me to my cruel oath . GHENT And when I come back ? Ruth does not answer . He takes a step nearerAnd when I come back ? RUTH You never  --  could  --  come back . GHENT No , I guess I never could . RUTH Eager , pleadingYou will go ? GHENT For good ? RUTH Yes . GHENT Do you mean that ? RUTH WildlyYes , yes , ten thousand times ! GHENT Is that your last word ? RUTH Yes . Pause . She watches him with strained anxietyO , why did you come here to-night ? p. 23 GHENT I come because I was blind-drunk and sun-crazy , and looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that 's not why I 'm staying . I 'm talking to you in my right mind now . I want you to try and see this thing the way it is . RUTH O , that is what I want you to do ! You did yourself and me a hideous wrong by coming here . Do n't do us both a more hideous wrong still ! I was in panic fear . I snatched at the first thing I could . Think what our life would be , beginning as we have begun ! O , for God 's pity go away now , and never come back ! Do n't you see there can never be anything between us but hatred , and misery , and horror ? GHENT HardeningWe 'll see about that !  --  Are you ready to start ? Ruth , conscious for the first time of her undress condition , shrinks , and folds her gown closer about her neckGo , and be quick about it . She starts toward her room ; he detains herWhere 's your saddle ? She points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note she has written , reads it , and stands for a moment in reflection before laying it down . He gets more water from the bucket , drinks deeply , mops his face , and rolls up the sleeve of his left arm , which is soaked with blood . He tries awkwardly to stanch a wound in his forearm , gives it up in disgust , and rolls down his sleeve again . He reads the note once more , then takes Ruth 's saddle and bridle from the wall and goes out . Ruth comes in ; her face is white and haggard , but her manner determined and collected . She comes to the table , and sees the bloody handkerchief and basin of water . As Ghent enters , she turns to him anxiously p. 24 RUTH You are hurt . GHENT It 's no matter . RUTH Where ? He indicates his left arm . She throws off her hooded riding-cloak , and impulsively gathers together water , towels , liniment , and bandages ; she approaches him , quite lost in her task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He obeys mechanically . She rapidly and deftly washes and binds the wound , speaking half to herself , between long pausesCan you lift your arm ?  --  The bone is not touched .  --  It will be all right in a few days .  --  This balsam is a wonderful thing to heal . GHENT Watching her dreamily , as she worksWhat 's your name ? RUTH Ruth  --  Ruth  --  Jordan . Long pauseThere , gently .  --  It must be very painful . He shakes his head slowly , with half-humorous protest GHENT It 's not fair ! RUTH What is n't fair ? GHENT To treat me like this . It 's not in the rules of the game . RUTH As the sense of the situation again sweeps over herBinding your wound ? I would do the same service for a dog . p. 25 GHENT Yes , I dare say . But the point is , I ai n't a dog ; I 'm a human  --  the worst way ! She rises and puts away the liniment and bandages . He starts up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something good for both of us ! You 'll never regret it ! I 'm a strong man ! He holds out his right arm , rigidI used to feel sometimes , before I went to the bad , that I could take the world like that and tilt her over . And I can do it , too , if you say the word ! I 'll put you where you can look down on the proudest . I 'll give you the kingdoms of the world and all the glory of ' em . She covers her face with her hands . He comes nearerGive me a chance , and I 'll make good . By God , girl , I 'll make good !  --  I 'll make a queen of you . I 'll put the world under your feet ! Ruth makes a passionate gesture , as if to stop her earsWhat makes you put your hands over your ears like that ? Do n't you like what I 'm saying to you ? RUTH Taking the words with difficultyDo you remember what that man said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian  --  and  --  his squaw . GHENT Yes . There was something in it , too . I was a fool to offer him that mean little wad . p. 26 RUTH For  --  me ! GHENT Well , yes , for you , if you want to put it that way . RUTH But  --  a chain of nuggets  --  that comes nearer being a fair price ? GHENT O , to buy off a greaser ! RUTH But to buy the soul of of them ! Breaking down in sudden sobsO , be careful how you treat me ! Be careful ! I say it as much for your sake as mine . Be careful ! GHENT Turns from her , his bewilderment and discomfiture translating itself into gruffnessWell , I guess we 'll blunder through .  --  Come along ! We 've no time to lose .  --  Where are your things ? At her gesture , he picks up the saddle-pack which she has brought out of the bedroom with her , and starts toward the door RUTH Taking a hammer from the window-ledge and handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . He drives in the staple of the bolt , while she throws the blood-stained water and handker-chief into the fire . He aids her in replacing the weapons on the walls , then takes the saddle-pack and stands at the door , waiting . She picks up her mother 's picture , and thrusts it in her bosom . After standing a moment in hesitation , she takes the picture out , kisses it , lays it on the mantel , face down . She extinguishes the lamp , and goes out hastily . He follows , closing the door@@ Stephen Ghent 's home , in the Cordilleras . At the right , crowning a rude terrace , is an adobe cabin , stained of pale buff , mellowed to ivory by sun and dust . Over it clamber vines loaded with purple bloom . The front of the cabin is turned at an angle toward the spectator , the farther side running parallel with the brink of a caon , of which the distant wall and upper reaches are crimsoned by the afternoon light . In the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats , made of natural rocks roughly worked with the chisel . The rude materials have manifestly been touched by a refined and artistic hand , bent on making the most of the glorious natural background . Against the rocks on the left stands a large hand-loom of the Navajo type , with weaving-stool , and a blanket half woven . On the table lies a half-finished Indian basket , and strips of colored weaving-materials lie in a heap on the ground . Cactus plants in blossom fill the niches of the rocks and lift their fantastic forms above the stones which wall the caon brink . At one point this wall is broken , where a path descends into the caon.Lon Anderson , a venerable-looking miner , with gray hair and beard , sits smoking before the cabin . Burt Williams , a younger man , peeps up over the edge of the caon , from the path . WILLIAMS Hello , Lon . Is the Missus inside ? Lon smokes on , without looking at the questionerLook here , I put a nickel in you , you blame rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Removes his pipe deliberatelyWhat you wantin ' off'n her now ? A music lesson or a headache powder ? WILLIAMS Boss 's waitin ' down at the mine , with a couple o ' human wonders he 's brought back with him from wherever he 's been this time . Something doin ' on the quiet . ANDERSON You can tell him his wife ai n't nowheres about . Burt produces an enormous bandana from his pocket , mounts the wall , and waves it . He sits on the wall and smokes for a moment in silence , looking down into the caon , as if watching the approaching party . He points with his pipe at the cabin WILLIAMS Funny hitch-up  --  this here one  --  I think . ANDERSON After a pauseHow much you gittin ' a day now ? WILLIAMS Same little smilin ' helpless three and six-bits . ANDERSON Anything extry for thinkin ' ? WILLIAMS Nope ! Throwed in . They smoke again . Burt glances down to reassure himself , then points at the loom and basketQueer business  --  this rug-weavin ' and basket-makin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wants to sit , day in and day out , like a half-starved Navajo , slavin ' over them fool things fur ?  --  Boss ai n't near , is he ? Do n't keep her short of ice-cream sodas and trolley-rides , does ' e ? Lon rises and approaches Burt , regarding him grimlySaw ' er totin ' a lot o ' that stuff burro-back over to the hotel week ' fore last .  --  An ' Dod Ranger  --  you know what a disgustin ' liar Dod is  --  he tells how he was makin ' tests over in the cross-caon , an ' all of a sudden plump he comes on her talkin ' to a sawed-off Mexican hobo , and when she sees Dod , she turns white 's a sheet . p. 30 ANDERSON With suppressed ferocityYou tell Dod Ranger to keep his mouth shet , and you keep yourn shet too  --  or by Jeehosophat , I 'll make the two of ye eat yer Adam 's apples and swaller the core ! WILLIAMS O , git down off'n yer hind legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You boys keep yer blatherin ' tongues off'n her ! Or you 'll get mixed up with Alonzo P. Anderson  --  He taps his breast --  so 's it 'll take a coroner to untangle ye ! WILLIAMS DeprecatinglyI guess I 'd stick up fur ' er ' s quick as you would , come to that . ANDERSON Well , we do n't need no stickin ' up fur ' er . What we need is less tongue . He leans down and speaks lowerEspecially when the boss is round . You tell the boys so . Burt looks at him in surprise and is about to speak ; Lon makes a warning signal , indicating the approach of the party below . Burt descends , saluting Ghent respectfully GHENT Peeping up over the edge of the caonCoast clear , eh , Lon ? ANDERSON Yes , sir . GHENT Where is she ? p. 31 ANDERSON Points along the brink of the caonKind o ' think she went out to Look-off Ledge .  --  Guess she did n't expect you back to-day . GHENT Speaking belowCome up , gentlemen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dapper young Easterner , and a Contractor , a bluff Western type . Ghent is neatly dressed in khaki , with riding-boots and broad felt hat . He has a prosperous and busy air , and is manifestly absorbed in the national game of making moneyTake a seat . CONTRACTOR Seats himself by the tableDo n't care if I do . That new stage of yours just jumped stiff-legged from the go-off . And the trail up here from the mine is a good deal of a proposition for the see-dentary . ARCHITECT As he takes in the stupendous viewWhat a wonderful place ! Even better than you described it . GHENT Yes . My wife picked it out .  --  Let 's see your plans . He removes basket from the table , where the Architect unrolls several sheets of blue paper ARCHITECT I have followed your instructions to the letter . I understand that nothing is to be touched except the house . p. 32 GHENT Not a stone , sir ; not a head of cactus . Even the vines you 've got to keep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little difficult . GHENT You can put ' em on a temporary trellis .  --  A little pains will do it . CONTRACTOR Maybe , with a man to shoo the masons off with a shot-gun . GHENT Over the plansProvide a dozen men , if necessary , with machine guns . CONTRACTOR As you please , Mr. Ghent . The owner of the Verde mine has a right to his whims , I reckon . ARCHITECT I have designed the whole house in the Spanish style , very broad and simple . This open space where we stand  --  Points to the plans --  I have treated as a semi-enclosed patio , with arcaded porches . GHENT DubiouslyGood . ARCHITECT This large room fronting the main arcade is the living-room . GHENT I guess we 'll have ' em all living-rooms . This place is to be lived in , from the word go . ARCHITECT Humoring himTo be sure , everything cheerful and open .  --  Here on the left of the inner court is the library and music-room. p. 33 GHENT I 'm afraid we wo n't have much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for frills . I used to play the concertina once , but it was a long while ago . ARCHITECT It can be used for other purposes . For instance , as a nursery , though I had put that on the other side . GHENT Embarrassed and delightedUm , yes , nursery .  --  Stamping-ground for the  --  ? The Architect nods ; the Contractor follows suit , with emphasis . Lon nods solemnly over his pipeGood . The Architect bends over to make a note with his pencil . Ghent restrains him and says somewhat sheepishly in his earYou can leave it music-room on the map . ARCHITECT Continuing his explanationThis wing  --  Ghent , interrupting him , holds the plan at arm 's length , with head on one side and eyes squinted , as he looks from the drawings to the cabin and surroundings GHENT Looks a little  --  sprawly on paper . I had sort of imagined something more  --  more up in the air , like them swell tepees on the Hill in Frisco . He makes a grandiose outline of high roofs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonious with the surroundings . p. 34 CONTRACTOR In answer to Ghent 's inquiring lookWo n't look so showy from the new hotel across yonder . He points to the left , down the curve of the caon wall GHENT What 's your estimate on this plan , now you 've seen the location ? CONTRACTOR It 's a long way to haul the stuff .  --  Say somewheres between twenty and twenty-five thousand . Twenty-five will be safe . GHENT Slightly staggeredThat 's a big lot of money , my friend ! CONTRACTOR With cold scornI thought we was talkin ' about a house ! I can build you a good sheep-corral for a right smart less . GHENT Well , I guess we do n't want any sheep-corrals . CONTRACTOR I should think not , with the Verde pumping money at you the way they tell she does . GHENT Holds up the plans again and looks at them in perplexed silence I 'll tell you , gentlemen , I 'll have to consult my wife about this before I decide . The fact is , I 've been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CONTRACTOR Expect to build it of an afternoon , while the lady was takin ' her see-ester ? p. 35 GHENT I thought I 'd smuggle her off somewhere for a while . He is silent a moment , ponderingNo ! It 's her house and she must O. K. the plans before ground is broke . He looks along the caon rimWould you mind waiting a few minutes till I see if I can find her ? He starts irresolutely , then turns backOr better still , leave the plans , and I 'll see you at the hotel to-morrow morning . I have n't been over there since it was opened . I 'd like to know what they 're making of it . CONTRACTOR AstonishedHai n't been over to the Buny Visty yet ? GHENT Too busy . CONTRACTOR Well , you 'll find it an up-to-date joint , and chock full of tourist swells and lungers . GHENT Good-afternoon , gentlemen . You 'll excuse me . You can find your way back all right ? Take the left-hand path . It 's better going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappears along the caon brink behind the cabin ARCHITECT Has been examining the work on the loom , and has then picked up the unfinished basket , admiringlyWhat a beautiful pattern ! I say , this is like those we saw at the hotel . To LonMay I ask who is making this ? Lon smokes in silence ; the Architect raises his voice , slightly sharpMay I ask who is making this ? p. 36 ANDERSON BenignlyYou kin , my friend , you kin ! ARCHITECT Well , then , the question is put . ANDERSON And very clear-put , too . You 'd ought to be in the law business , young man . He gets up deliberatelyOr some other business that 'd take up all yer time . ARCHITECT Between wrath and amusementWell , I 'll be hanged ! He follows his companion down the caon path , stopping a moment at the brink to look round with a professional air at the house and surroundings , then at LonTart old party ! He descends . Lon crosses to the table , looks over the plans , makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes his head dubiously , as he rolls up the plans . Ruth appears , emerging from the caon path . She wears the same dress as at the close of Act I , with a dark scarf-like handkerchief thrown over her head . She is pale and exhausted . She sinks on the rocks at the edge of the caon ANDERSON Approaching her , anxiouslyIt 's too much fer you , ma'am . You 'd oughter let me go . He brings her a glass of water from an Indian water-jar before the cabin p. 37 RUTH Tasting the waterO , I thought I should never get back ! She leans against a rock , with closed eyes , then rouses herself againLon , take the glass , and see if you can make out any one down yonder , on the nearer trail . I  --  I thought some one was following me . ANDERSON Speaks lowExcuse me askin ' , Mis ' Ghent , but is that dod-blamed Mexican a-both-erin ' you again ? RUTH No . He has gone away , for good . It 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to know .  --  Look if you can make out a man 's figure , coming up . ANDERSON Takes the glass from the niche in the rocks , and scans the caon pathCa n't see nothin ' but a stray burro , an ' he ai n't got no figger to speak of .  --  Might be t' other side o ' Table Rock , down in the pinyon scrub . Ruth gets up with an effort , takes the glass and looks through it , then lays it on the ledgeExcuse me , ma'am , but  --  Mister Ghent come home this afternoon . RUTH StartledWhere is he ? ANDERSON Huntin ' for you down Look-off Ledge way . I ' lowed you was there , not knowin ' what else to say . RUTH Thank you , Lon.  --  You can go now . He goes down the caon path . Ruth looks once more through the glass , then crosses to the table , where she sits down and begins to finger the roll of plans . Ghent reenters . He approaches with soft tread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry , avoiding his embrace p. 38 RUTH You frightened me.  --  When did you come back ? GHENT An hour ago . RUTH Was your journey successful ? GHENT Yes . But my home-coming  --  that looks rather like a failure . PauseI expected to find you out on the bluff . RUTH Lon was mistaken . I had gone the other way . As she stands at the table , she begins to unroll the plansWhat are these papers ? GHENT Have n't you one word of welcome for me , after five days ? Ruth remains silent , with averted head , absently unrolling the packetNot a look even ? He waits a moment , then sighs and seats himself moodily by the table I never can remember ! After I 've been away from you for twelve hours , I forget completely . RUTH Forget what ? GHENT How it stands between us . It 's childish , but for the life of me I ca n't help it .  --  After I 've been away a few hours , this place gets all lit up with bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simile --  well , like a Christmas tree ! I dare say a Christmas tree do n't amount to much in real life , but I saw one once , in a play ,  --  I was a little mining-camp roust-about , so high ,  --  and ever since it has sort of stood to me for the gates o ' glory . p. 39 RUTH With a hysterical laughA Christmas tree ! She bows her head in her hands , and repeats the words , as if to herself , in a tone in which bitterness has given place to tragic melancholyA Christmas tree ! Ghent , watching her moodily , crumples up the plans and throws them upon the ground . He goes toward the cabin , hesitates , turns , and comes back to the table , where Ruth still sits with buried head . He draws from his pocket a jewel-case , which he opens and lays before her GHENT There is a little present I brought home for you . And here are some more trinkets . He takes out several pieces of jewelry and tumbles them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these things , but I had to buy something , the way I was feeling . And these papers  --  Picks them up and spreads them out on the table --  these mean that you 're not to live much longer in a mud shanty , with pine boxes for furniture . These are the drawings for a new house that I want to talk over with you . He points at the map and speaks glibly , trying to master his discomfiture at her lack of interestSpanish style , everything broad and simple ! Large living-room opening on inner court . Library and music-room , bless your heart . Bedrooms ; kitchen and thereunto pertaining . Wing where the proprietor retires to express his inmost feelings . General effect sprawly , but harmonious with the surroundings . Twenty thousand estimated , twenty-five limit . Is she ours ? p. 40 RUTH In a dead , flat toneHow much did you say the house is to cost ? GHENT Twenty-five thousand dollars at the outside . RUTH And these  --  trinkets ? GHENT O , I do n't know .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pours the jewels in a heap upon them from her lifted handsTwenty-five thousand dollars and the odd hundreds ! She laughs suddenly and jarringlyMy price has risen ! My price has risen ! She laughs again , as she rises from the table and looks down the caon pathKeep those displayed to show to our visitors ! My honor is at stake . She points down the pathThere is one coming now ! GHENT Visitors ? What visitors ? RUTH Only an old school-friend of mine ; a Mr. Winthrop Newbury . GHENT What are you talking about ? Are you crazy ? He joins her , where she stands looking down into the caonThis fellow , is he really what you say ? Ruth nods , with unnaturally bright eyes and mocking smileWhat does this mean ? p. 41 RUTH It means that he caught sight of me , an hour ago , in the hotel . GHENT In the hotel ? What were you doing there ? RUTH With biting calmNothing wicked  --  as yet . They do n't pay twenty-five thousand dollars over there  --  at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a physical blow . She raises her hands to him , in a swift revulsion of feelingO , do n't judge me ! Do n't listen to me ! I am not in my right mind . GHENT Sweeps the jewels together , and throws them over the cliffDo you want me to be here , while you see him ? She does not answerWo n't you answer me ? RUTH Again coldAct as you think best . GHENT It 's a question of what will be easiest for you . RUTH O , it 's all easy for me ! Ghent stands irresolute , then raises his hand in a gesture of perplexity and despair , and goes into the house , closing the door . Winthrop Newbury appears at the top of the caon path , looks curiously about , catches sight of Ruth 's averted figure , and rushes toward her NEWBURY Ruth ! Is it really you ? Ruth starts involuntarily toward him , stretching out her arms . As he advances , she masters herself , and speaks in a natural voice , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42 RUTH Well , of all things ! Winthrop Newbury ! How did you find your way to this eagle 's nest ? NEWBURY I  --  we saw you  --  we caught a glimpse of you at the hotel , but we were n't sure . We followed you , but lost you in the caon . RUTH We ? Who is we ? NEWBURY Your brother and his wife . RUTH Turning the shock , which she has been unable to conceal , into conventional surprisePhilip and Polly here ! NEWBURY They took the other turn , down there where the path forks . We did n't know which way you had gone . RUTH Yes , but why on earth are they here at all ? NEWBURY They are on their way East . They stopped over to see me . RUTH To see you ? Are you  --  living here ? NEWBURY I have been here only a week . He starts impulsively , trying to break through the conventional wall which she has raised between themRuth  --  for God 's sake  --  ! RUTH Interrupting him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How do you happen to be here  --  of all places ? p. 43 NEWBURY What does it matter ? I am here . We have found you , after all these miserable months of anxiety and searching . O Ruth  --  why  --  RUTH I have acted badly , I know . But I wish not to talk of that . Not now . I will explain everything later . Tell me about yourself  --  about Philip and Polly  --  and mother . I am thirsty for news . What have you been doing all these months , since  --  our queer parting ? NEWBURY SolemnlyLooking for you . PauseO Ruth  --  how could you do it ? How could you do it ? RUTH Touches him on the arm , and looks at him with dumb entreaty , speaking lowWinthrop ! NEWBURY In answer to her unspoken wordsAs you will . RUTH Resumes her hard , bright toneYou have n't told me about mother . How is she ? NEWBURY Well . Or she will be , now . Ruth , you ought at least to have written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a nervous uplift of her armsYes , yes , I know that !  --  And you are  --  settled here ? You mean to remain ? NEWBURY I am physician at the End-of-the-Rainbow mines , three miles below . At least I  --  I am making a trial of it . PauseHow pale and worn you are .  --  Do n't turn away . Look at me . She flinches , then summons her courage and looks him steadily in the faceYou are  --  you are ill  --  I fear you are desperately ill ! p. 44 RUTH Moving away nervouslyNonsense . I was never better in my life . She goes toward the caon brinkYou have n't praised our view . We are very proud of it . NEWBURY Following herYes , very fine . Magnificent . RUTH But you 're not looking at it at all ! Do you see that bit of smoke far down yonder ? That is the stamp mill of the Rio Verde mine . NEWBURY Compelling himself to follow her leadYes  --  the Rio Verde . One of the big strikes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RUTH None that I ever heard of , and I ought to know . For  --  she makes a sweeping bow --  we are the Rio Verde , at your service . NEWBURY You  --  your  --  husband is the owner of the Verde mine ? RUTH No less ! NEWBURY EmbarrassedWe found the record of your marriage at San Jacinto . The name was Ghent  --  Stephen Ghent . RUTH Yes . He will be so glad to see some of my people . Winthrop 's eyes have fallen on the basket at the foot of the table . He picks it up , examines it curiously , and looks meaningly at Ruth , who snatches it from his hand and throws it over the cliffA toy I play with ! You know I always have to keep my hands busy pottering at some rubbishy craft or other . p. 45 NEWBURY Is about to speak , but checks himself . He points at the loomAnd the blanket , too ? RUTH Yes , another fad of mine . It is really fascinating work . The Indian women who taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So do  --  the women  --  over there . He points across the caon RUTH FlushingAh , yes , you saw some of my stuff at the hotel . You know how vain I am . I had to show it . NEWBURY Perhaps . But why should the wife of the man who owns the Verde mine sell her handiwork , and under such  --  such vulgar conditions ? RUTH Brilliantly explanatoryTo see if it will sell , of course ! That is the test of its merit . He looks at her in mute protest , then with a shake of the head , rises and puts on his hat NEWBURY Do you want to see the others ? RUTH Why , yes , to be sure I do . How should I not ? NEWBURY You have n't seemed very anxious  --  these last eight months . RUTH True . I have been at fault . I so dread explanations . And Phil 's tempests of rage ! Poor boy , he must feel sadly ill-used. p. 46 NEWBURY He does . HesitatesIf there is any reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ,  --  RUTH There is no reason . At least , none valid . NEWBURY Then I will bring them up . RUTH By all means . She holds out her hand , smilingAuf wiedersehen ! Winthrop releases her hand and goes toward the caon path . He waves , and turns to Ruth . NEWBURY They are just below . As Ruth advances he takes her hand and looks searchingly into her eyesFor old friendship 's sake , wo n't you give me one human word before they come ? At least answer me honestly one human question ? RUTH Keeping up her hard , bright gayetyIn the great lottery of a woman 's answers there is always one such prize ! NEWBURY Dejectedly , as he drops her handIt 's no use , if that is your mood . RUTH My mood ! Your old bugbear ! I am as sober-serious as my stars ever let me be . NEWBURY Did you , that night you bade me good-bye , know that  --  this was going to happen ? p. 47 RUTH Cordially explanatoryNo . It was half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranch alone . My lover came , impatient , importunate , and I  --  went with him . NEWBURY And your  --  this man  --  to whom you are married  --  pardon me , you do n't need to answer unless you wish  --  for how long had you known him ? RUTH Solemnly , as she looks him straight in the eyesAll my life ! And for aeons before . He looks at her for a moment , then goes toward the caon path . Polly 's voice is heard calling POLLY Not yet visibleWin ! Win ! NEWBURY Calls down the caonCome up ! Come up ! Ruth goes past him down the caon path . In a moment she reappears , with Polly . They are laughing and talking as they come POLLY Ruth ! RUTH Dear old Polly ! POLLY You naughty girl ! RUTH If our sins must find us out , you are the kind of Nemesis I choose . POLLY My ! But you 're a shady character . And sly ! Philip appears . Ruth hurries to embrace him , while Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surroundings with curiosity p. 48 RUTH O Phil !  --  Dear old man ! She covers his face lightly with her handsNo scolding , no frowns . This is the finding of the prodigal , and she expects a robe and a ring . POLLY Seating herself on a rockHeavens , what a climb !  --  I 'm a rag . RUTH Motions to the men to be seatedThe cabin would n't hold us all , but there 's one good thing about this place ; there 's plenty of outdoors . NEWBURY Looking aboutI should say there was ! POLLY To think of our practical Ruth doing the one really theatrical thing known in the annals of Milford Corners , Mass. !  --  And what a setting ! My dear , your stage arrangements are perfect . RUTH In this case Providence deserves the credit . We may have come here to have our pictures taken , but we stayed to make a living . Philip has drawn apart , gloomy and threatening . Polly keeps up her heroic efforts to give the situation a casual and humorous air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who ? POLLY He ! Ruth points at the cabin , smilingWell , produce him ! p. 49 RUTH Following , with gratitude in her eyes , the key of lightness and raillery which Polly has struckYou insist ? POLLY Absolutely . RUTH O , very well ! She goes up the rocky incline , and enters the cabin , calling : " Steve ! Steve ! " Polly goes to Philip and shakes him POLLY Now you behave ! Indicates WinthropHe 's behaving . Ruth reappears in the doorway , followed by Ghent RUTH With elaborate gayety , as they descend the rocksWell , Stephen , since they 've run us to earth , I suppose we must put a good face on it , and acknowledge them .  --  This is Polly , of whom I 've talked so much . Polly the irresistible . Beware of her ! Polly shakes his hand cordiallyAnd this is -- my brother Philip . Ghent extends his hand , which Philip pointedly ignores . Ruth goes on hastily , to cover the insultAnd this is my old school-friend , Winthrop Newbury . They shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner of the famous Verde mine . GHENT Part owner , sir . I had n't the capital to develop with , so I had to dispose of a half-interest. p. 50 NEWBURY Is n't there some litigation under way ? RUTH Looking at Ghent , surprisedLitigation ? GHENT Yes  --  a whole rigmarole . POLLY Catching at a straw to make talkHeaven help you if you have got entangled in the law ! I can conceive of nothing more horrible or ghostly than a court of law ; unless She glances at Philipit is that other court of high justice , which people hold in private to judge their fellows , from hearsay and half-knowledge ! RUTH Keeping up the play desperately , as she blesses Polly with a lookBut there must be law , just the same , and penalties and rewards and all that . Else what 's the use of being good ? POLLY Like you  --  for instance ! RUTH Well , yes , like me ! POLLY You are not good , you are merely magnificent . I want to be magnificent ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own a gold mine ! To GhentShow me where the sweet thing is . GHENT We can get a better view of the plant from the ledge below . Will you go down ? Ghent , Polly , and Winthrop go down the caon path . Ruth takes Philip by the arm , to lead him after p. 51 PHILIP No . We must have a word together , before the gabble begins again . Winthrop has given me your explanation , which explains nothing . RUTH Trying to keep up the light toneHas n't that usually been the verdict on explanations of my conduct ? PHILIP Do n't try to put me off ! Tell me in two words how you came to run away with this fellow . RUTH HardeningRemember to whom you are speaking and about whom . PHILIP I got your note , with its curt announcement of your resolve . Later , by mere accident , we found the record of your marriage at San Jacinto  --  if you call it a marriage , made hugger-mugger at midnight by a tipsy justice of the peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only pray that no one will . But I want to know how it came to be made , in such hurry and secrecy  --  how it came to be made at all , for that matter . How did you ever come to disgrace yourself and your family by clandestine meetings and a hedgerow marriage with a person of this class ? And why , after the crazy leap was taken , did you see fit to hide yourself away without a word to me or your distracted mother ? Though that perhaps is easier to understand ! RUTH The manner of your questions absolves me from the obligation to answer them . p. 52 PHILIP I refuse to be put off with any such patent subterfuge . RUTH Subterfuge or not , it will have to suffice , until you remember that my right to choose my course in life is unimpeachable , and that the man whose destiny I elect to share can not be insulted in my presence . PHILIP Very well , I can wait . The truth will come out some day . Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the critical moment of our enterprise has spelled ruin for me . RUTH OverwhelmedPhilip , you do n't mean  --  ! PHILIP Absolute and irretrievable ruin . RUTH Then you are going back East  --  for good ? PHILIP Yes . RUTH But  --  mother 's money ! What will she do ? Philip shrugs his shouldersIs everything gone  --  everything ? PHILIP I shall get something from the sale . Perhaps enough to make a fresh start , somewhere , in some small way . RUTH Comes to him , and lays her arms on his shouldersPhil , I am sorry , sorry ! He caresses her ; she bursts into suppressed convulsive weeping and clings to him , hiding her face in his breast p. 53 PHILIP Ruth , you are not happy ! You have made a hideous mistake . Come home with me . Ruth shakes her headAt least for a time.You are not well . You look really ill . Come home with us , if only for a month . RUTH No , no , dear Phil , dear brother ! She draws down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an attempt at lightnessThere ! I have had my cry , and feel better . The excitement of seeing you all again is a little too much for me . PHILIP If there is anything that you want to tell me about all this , tell me now . RUTH O , there will be plenty of time for explanations and all that ! Let us just be happy now in our reunion . PHILIP There will not be plenty of time . We leave to-morrow morning . RUTH Then you will take me on trust  --  like a dear good brother . Perhaps I shall never explain ! I like my air of mystery . PHILIP Remember that if you ever have anything to complain of  --  in your life  --  it is my right to know it . The offender shall answer to me , and dearly , too . RUTH Takes his head between her hands , and shakes it , as with recovered gayetyOf course they will , you old fire-eater ! p. 54 PHILIP Pointing to the blanket on the loomRuth , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture , as she is looking at the others , who come up from below . The men linger in the background , Ghent pointing out objects in the landscape RUTH To Polly , who advancesWell , what do you think of us , in a bird's-eye view ? POLLY In a bird's-eye view you are superb ! She draws Ruth to her , and speaks in a lower toneAnd looked at near , you are an enthralling puzzle . RUTH Half to herselfIf you only knew how much ! POLLY Taking Ruth by the chin as in Act ISo you had  --  just by chance  --  riding over to the trading-station or so  --  met the glorious unfulfilled  --  in blue overalls and a jumper ! I thought so ! Ruth bows her head in a spasm of pain . Polly , who does not see her face , goes on teasinglyI see now what you meant about wanting one that was n't finished . This one certainly is n't finished . But when he is , he 'll be grand ! Ruth moves away with averted head . Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulk ! I meant nothing disrespectful . On the contrary , I 'm crazy about him .

I ca n't let her until we have shown her what it 's going to be . With Ghent 's aid she spreads out the plans , which Polly examines with curiosityThese are the plans for our new house . You call us magnificent . We will show you that we are not . We are overwhelming ! NEWBURY Looking at his watchI am afraid we must be getting back . It grows dark very suddenly in the caon . RUTH To PollyWell , then you may come in , if you will promise to view the simple present in the light of the ornate future . Polly goes in . Ruth , lingering at the door for an instant , looks back anxiously at the men PHILIP Curtly , to GhentIf you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GHENT Certainly . Winthrop effaces himself , making and lighting a cigarette , as he looks out over the caon PHILIP In deference to my sister 's wishes , I refrain from asking you for the explanation which is due me . Ghent bows in silenceBut there is one thing which I think I am at liberty to question . p. 56 GHENT Do so . PHILIP I hear of your interest in a valuable mine . I hear of plans for an elaborate house . Why , then , is my sister compelled to peddle her own handiwork in a public caravansery ? GHENT What do you mean ? I do n't understand you . PHILIP Points at the loomHer rugs and baskets are on sale in the corridor of the hotel , fingered and discussed by the tourist mob . GHENT AstonishedThis ca n't be true ! PHILIP It is , however . GHENT I know nothing of it . I 've had to be away a great deal . I knew she worked too hard over these things , but I took it for a mere pastime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ! PHILIP I advise you to make inquiries . She has taken pains to conceal her identity , but it is known nevertheless , and the subject of public curiosity . Polly and Ruth come out from the cabin POLLY To PhilipTake me away quickly , or I shall never enjoy upholstery again ! To RuthPlease change your mind , dear , and come with us for the night . p. 57 RUTH No . I will see you in the morning . NEWBURY We leave by the early stage . RUTH Looking at him quicklyYou too ? NEWBURY Yes , I have decided so . RUTH I will be there in good time , trust me . She kisses Polly and PhilipGood-bye , till morning . Gives her hand to WinthropGood-bye . Philip ignores Ghent pointedly in the leave-takings . Polly bids him farewell with corresponding cordiality POLLY Good-bye , Mr. Ghent .

Her voice is heard for some time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waves to them as they descend GHENT Looks long at her , with deep gratitudeGod bless you ! She sits down on the rocks of the cabin terrace .

You are worn out . p. 58 RUTH Rousing herselfNo , there is something I must tell you first . GHENT Points at the rugIt 's about this  --  work you have been doing ? RUTH Slightly startledYou know of that ? GHENT Your brother told me . I should have found it out to-morrow anyhow . PauseHave you wanted money ? RUTH Yes . GHENT I thought I  --  I thought you had enough . I have often begged you to take more . RUTH I have n't spent what you gave me . It is in there .

I have paid for everything .  --  I have kept account of it  --  O , to the last dreadful penny ! These clothes are the ones I wore from my brother 's house that night . This shelter  --  you know I helped to raise that with my own hands . And  --  and some things I paid for secretly , from the little hoard I brought away with me . You were careless ; you did not notice . p. 59 GHENT Sits down , dizzy from the shock of her words I must try to grasp this ! There is a silence , during which he sits perfectly motionless . At last he turns to herWhy  --  why did you stand up so plucky , so splendid , just now ? Put a good face on everything about our life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  before your own people ? RUTH We are man and wife . Beside that , my own people are as strangers . GHENT EagerlyYou say that ? You can still say that ? RUTH Looks up , startledCa n't you ? She awaits his answer tensely GHENT DesperatelyO , I do n't know . I ca n't say or think anything , after what you have just told me ! RUTH WailsYou ca n't say it ! And it is n't true ! It is we who are strangers .  --  Worse , a thousand times worse ! GHENT Rises and stands over her . Do n't let us dash ourselves to hell in one crazy minute ! He pauses and hesitates . When he speaks again it is with wistful tendernessRuth , do you remember our journey here ? She lifts her head , looking at him with white , thirsty faceI thought  --  it seemed to me you had  --  begun to care for me. p. 60 RUTH That night , when we rode away from the justice 's office at San Jacinto , and the sky began to brighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  She touches her heart --  began to melt in spite of me . And when the next night and the next day passed , and the next , and still you spared me and treated me with beautiful rough chivalry , I said to myself , " He has heard my prayer to him . He knows what a girl 's heart is . " As you rode before me down the arroyos , and up over the mesas , through the dazzling sunlight and the majestic silence , it seemed as if you were leading me out of a world of little codes and customs into a great new world .  --  So it was for those first days .  --  And then  --  and then  --  I woke , and saw you standing in my tent-door in the starlight ! I knew before you spoke that we were lost . You had n't the strength to save us ! GHENT HuskilySurely it has n't all been  --  hateful to you ? There have been times , since that .  --  The afternoon we climbed up here . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines . RUTH In a half whisperYes !  --  Beautiful days ! She puts her hands suddenly before her face and sobsO , it was not my fault ! I have struggled against it . You do n't know how I have struggled ! GHENT Against what ? Struggled against what ? p. 61 RUTH Against the hateful image you had raised up beside your own image . GHENT What do you mean ? RUTH I mean that sometimes  --  often  --  when you stand there before my eyes , you fade away , and in your place I see  --  the Other One ! GHENT Speak plainly , for God 's sake ! I do n't understand this talk . RUTH Looking steadfastly , as at an invisible shape , speaks in a horrified whisperThere he stands behind you now !  --  The human beast , that goes to its horrible pleasure as not even a wild animal will go  --  in pack , in pack !

You began to load me with gifts  --  to force easy ways upon me  --  GHENT Well , what else did I care to make money for ? Ruth does not answer for a moment , then speaks slowly , taking the words with loathing upon her tongue p. 62 RUTH Every time you give me anything , or talk about the mine and what it is going to do , there rings in my ears that dreadful sneer : " A dirt-eating Mojave would pay more than that for his squaw ! " She rises , lifting her arms I held myself so dear ! And you bought me for a handful of gold , like a woman of the street ! You drove me before you like an animal from the market ! Ghent has seated himself again , elbows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her bosom the nugget chain and holds it crumpled up in her palm . Her tone is quiet , almost matter-of-factI have got back the chain again . GHENT Looks upChain ?  --  What chain ? RUTH In the same tone , as she hold it up , letting it unwindThe one you bought me with . GHENT DumfoundedWhere the devil  --  ? Has that fellow been around here ? RUTH It would have had no meaning for me except from his hand . GHENT So that 's what you 've been doing with this rug-weaving and basket-making tomfoolery ? Ruth does not answer , but continues looking at the chain , running it through her fingers and weighing it in her handHow long has this been going on ? p. 63 RUTH How long ?  --  How long can one live without breathing ? Two minutes ? A few life-times ? How long ! GHENT It was about a month after we came here that you began to potter with this work . RUTH Draws her hand about her neck as if loosening something there ; convulsivelySince then this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chain of eating fire . Link by link I have unwound it . You will never know what it has cost me , but I have paid it all . Take it and let me go free . She tries to force it upon him , with wailing entreatyTake it , take it , I beseech you ! GHENT Holding himself under stern controlYou are killing yourself . You must n't go on this way . Go and rest . We will talk of this to-morrow . RUTH Rest ! To-morrow ! O , how little you have understood of all I have said ! I know it is only a symbol  --  a make-believe . I know I am childish to ask it . Still , take it and tell me I am free . Ghent takes the chain reluctantly , stands for a moment looking at it , then speaks with iron firmness GHENT As you say , your price has risen . This is not enough . He throws the chain about her neck and draws her to him by it You are mine , mine , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . She holds out her hand blindly to detain him p. 64 RUTH In a stifled voiceWait ! There is  --  something else . He returns to her , anxiously , and stands waiting . She goes on , touching the chainIt is n't only for my sake I ask you to take this off me , nor only for your sake . There is  --  another life  --  to think of . GHENT Leaning to look into her averted faceRuth !  --  Is it true ?  --  Thank God ! RUTH Now will you take this off me ? GHENT Starts to do so , then draws backNo . Now less than ever . For now , more than ever , you are mine . RUTH But  --  how yours ? O , remember , have pity ! How yours ? Philip appears at the head of the caon path . Hearing their voices , he waits , half concealed GHENT No matter how ! Bought if you like , but mine ! Mine by blind chance and the hell in a man 's veins , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not ! RUTH Nature ! Almighty Nature ! She takes the chain slowly from her neckNot yours ! By everything my people have held sacred ! She drops the chainNot yours ! Not yours ! She turns slowly . Philip has come forward , and supports her as she sinks half fainting upon his neck p. 65 PHILIP To GhentI came back to get my sister for the night .  --  I do n't know by what ugly spell you have held her , but I know , from her own lips , that it is broken . To RuthCome ! I have horses below . GHENT No ! PHILIP Measuring himYes . Pause GHENT Let her say ! RUTH Looks long at Ghent , then at the house and surroundings . At last she turns to her brotherTake me  --  with you . Take me  --  home ! Philip , supporting her , leads her down the caon path . Ghent stands gazing after them as they disappear below the rim .

At the back is a fireplace , flanked by windows , the curtains of which are drawn . On the left is a small table , with a lamp , books , and magazines ; on the right , near the fireplace , a sewing-table , with lamp and sewing-basket .

The door on the left opens , and Mrs. Jordan enters , with Dr. Newbury . During the preceding conversation Ruth has sat sewing , paying no heed to the chatter . Mrs. Jordan and the Doctor look at her as they come in , but she does not look up MRS . JORDAN Sit down , Doctor , at least for a moment . DR .

POLLY Well , Ruth is one of those people who ca n't live in a state of divided feeling . She sits staring at this cleavage in her life , like  --  like that man in Dante , do n't you know , who is pierced by the serpent , and who stands there in hell staring at his wound , yawning like a sleepy man . MRS . JORDAN O , Polly , do please try not to get our heads muddled up with literature ! POLLY All I mean is that when she married her man she married him for keeps . And he did the same by her .

JORDAN Looking at her severelyPray what does that mean ? POLLY O , Phil is such a walking thunder-cloud , these days . It 's a relief to get rid of him . p. 76 MRS . JORDAN Have you done what you could to make his life brighter ? POLLY I never had a chance . He has always been too much wrapped up in Ruth to think of me . MRS .

But immensely interesting to watch . MRS . JORDAN With a despairing gestureIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent on bringing those two together ?

JORDAN On Philip 's account . POLLY O , bother Philip ! Was n't that the doorbell ? MRS . JORDAN Yes . You had better go . Polly goes out . After a moment she reenters , excitedly p. 78 POLLY It 's Mr. Ghent ! MRS . JORDAN AmazedMr . Ghent ? Polly nods enthusiastically . Ghent enters .

Anyway , there are the papers ! Do what you think best with them . He lays the papers on the table , and picks up his hat MRS . JORDAN Wait in the parlor . He opens the hall doorThe second door on the left . With an awkward bow to Mrs. Jordan , he partly closes the door after him , when the inner door opens and Ruth appears . She goes to the sewing-table and picks up her sewing . Her mother , with a frightened glance at the half-open hall door , draws her back and kisses her .

He has done a great deal for us , and is anxious to do more , if you will only let him . RUTH What is this ? Explain it to me quickly . MRS . JORDAN With growing impatienceDo n't think to judge your mother ! p. 84 RUTH I demand to hear what all this is ! Tell me . MRS . JORDAN Losing control of herselfHe has kept us from being turned into the street ! Ghent , who has tried dumbly to restrain her , turns away in stoic resignation to his fateHe has given us the very roof over our heads ! RUTH You said that uncle  --  MRS . JORDAN Well , it was not your uncle ! I said so to shield you in your stubborn and cold-hearted pride . RUTH Is there more of this ? MRS . JORDAN Yes , there is more . You wronged your brother to follow your own path of wilful love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wilful aversion . Here comes your husband , offering to make restitution  --  RUTH What restitution ? MRS . JORDAN He has bought Philip 's property out there , and wants you to give it back to him . Ruth stands motionless for a moment , then looks vacantly about , speaking in a dull voice , as at first RUTH I must go away from this house . MRS . JORDAN You do n't understand . He claims nothing . He is going away himself immediately . Whatever this dreadful trouble is between you , you are his wife , and he has a right to help you and yours . p. 85 RUTH I am not his wife . MRS . JORDAN Ruth , do n't frighten me . He said those same words  --  RUTH He said  --  what ? MRS . JORDAN That you were not his wife . RUTH He said  --  that ? MRS . JORDAN Yes , but afterward he explained  --  RUTH Flaming into white wrathExplained ! Did he explain that when I was left alone that night at the ranch he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife had failed me , and nothing stood between me and their drunken fury , I sold myself to the strongest of them , hiding my head behind the name of marriage ? Did he explain that between him and the others money clinked  --  She raps on the table --  my price in hard money on the table ? And now that I have run away to the only refuge I have on earth , he comes to buy the very house where I have hidden , and every miserable being within it ! Long pause . She looks about blankly and sinks down by the table MRS . JORDAN Cold and rigidAnd you  --  married him  --  after that ? She turns away in horror-stricken judgmentYou ought to have  --  died  --  first ! Philip opens the door and enters , staring at Ghent with dislike and menaceO Philip , she has told me !  --  You ca n't imagine what horrors ! Ruth rises , with fright in her face , and approaches her brother to restrain him p. 86 PHILIP Horrors ? What horrors ? MRS . JORDAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her alone in that dreadful place ! She  --  she married him  --  to save herself  --  from  --  O horrible ! Philip waits an instant , the truth penetrating his mind slowly . Then , with mortal rage in his face , he starts toward Ghent PHILIP You  --  dog ! Ruth throws herself in Philip 's path RUTH No , no , no ! PHILIP Get out of my way . This is my business now . RUTH No , it is mine . I tell you it is mine . PHILIP We 'll see whose it is . I said that if the truth ever came out , this man should answer to me , and now , by God , he shall answer ! With another access of rage he tries to thrust Ruth from his path . Mrs. Jordan , terrified at the storm she has raised , clings desperately to her son 's arm RUTH I told him long ago it should be between us . Now it shall be between us . MRS . JORDAN Philip ! For my sake , for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will only make it worse . In pity 's name , leave them alone together . Leave them alone  --  together ! They force Philip back to the door , where he stands glaring at Ghent p. 87 PHILIP To GhentMy time will come . Meanwhile , hide behind the skirts of the woman whose life you have ruined and whose heart you have broken . Hide behind her . It is the coward 's privilege . Take it . Philip , with Mrs. Jordan still clinging to his arm , goes out , Ruth closing the door after them . She and Ghent confront each other in silence for a moment , across the width of the room RUTH God forgive me ! You never can . GHENT It was a pity  --  but  --  you were in a corner . I drove you to it , by coming here . RUTH It was base of me  --  base ! GHENT The way your mother took it showed me one thing .  --  I 've never understood you , because  --  I do n't understand your people . RUTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than accept life as I did ? GHENT Yes . RUTH She spoke the truth . I have always seen it . GHENT Ruth , it 's a queer thing for me to be saying , but  --  it seems to me , you 've never seen the truth between us . RUTH What is the truth  --  between us ? GHENT The truth is  --  He pauses , then continues with a disconsolate gestureWell , there 's no use going into that . He fumbles in his pocket , and takes from it the nugget chain , which he looks at in silence for a time , then speaks in quiet resignationI 've got here the chain , that 's come , one way and another , to have a meaning for us . For you it 's a bitter meaning , but , all the same , I want you to keep it . Show it some day to the boy , and tell him  --  about me . He lays it on the desk and goes toward the door p. 88 RUTH What is the truth  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself I was thinking . RUTH What is it  --  about yourself ? GHENT After a pause I drifted into one of your meeting-houses last Sunday , not knowing where else to go , and I heard a young fellow preaching about what he called " The Second Birth . " A year and a half ago I should have thought it was all hocus-pocus , but you can believe me or not , the way he went on he might have been behind the door that night in that little justice den at San Jacinto , saying to the Recording Angel : " Do you see that rascal ? Take notice ! There ai n't an ounce of bone or a drop of blood in him but what 's new man ! " RUTH You think it has been all my fault  --  the failure we 've made of our life ? GHENT It 's been no failure . However it is , it 's been our life , and in my heart I think it 's been  --  all  --  right ! RUTH All right ! O , how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of awe and wonderAll right ! GHENT Some of it has been wrong , but as a whole it has been right  --  right ! I know that does n't happen often , but it has happened to us , because  --  He stops , unable to find words for his ideabecause  --  because the first time our eyes met , they burned away all that was bad in our meeting , and left only the fact that we had met  --  pure good  --  pure joy  --  a fortune of it  --  for both of us . Yes , for both of us ! You 'll see it yourself some day . p. 89 RUTH If you had only heard my cry to you , to wait , to cleanse yourself and me  --  by suffering and sacrifice  --  before we dared begin to live ! But you would n't see the need !  --  O , if you could have felt for yourself what I felt for you ! If you could have said , " The wages of sin is death ! " and suffered the anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that , what you had done fell off from you like any daily trifle . GHENT Steps impulsively nearer her , sweeping his hand to indicate the portraits on the wallsRuth , it 's these fellows are fooling you ! It 's they who keep your head set on the wages of sin , and all that rubbish . What have we got to do with suffering and sacrifice ? That may be the law for some , and I 've tried hard to see it as our law , and thought I had succeeded . But I have n't ! Our law is joy , and selfishness ; the curve of your shoulder and the light on your hair as you sit there says that as plain as preaching .  --  Does it gall you the way we came together ? You asked me that night what brought me , and I told you whiskey , and sun , and the devil . Well , I tell you now I 'm thankful on my knees for all three ! Does it rankle in your mind that I took you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud ? I guess most good women are taken that way , if they only knew it . Do n't you want to be paid for ? I guess every wife is paid for in some good coin or other . And as for you , I 've paid for you not only with a trumpery chain , but with the heart in my breast , do you hear ? That 's one thing you ca n't throw back at me  --  the man you 've made of me , the life and the meaning of life you 've showed me the way to ! Ruth 's face is hidden in her hands , her elbows on the table . He stands over her , flushed and waiting . Gradually the light fades from his face . When he speaks again , the ring of exultation which has been in his voice is replaced by a sober intensityIf you ca n't see it my way , give me another chance to live it out in yours . He waits , but she does not speak or look up . He takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and runs them over , in deep reflectionDuring the six months I 've been East  --  p. 90 RUTH Looking upSix months ? Mother said a week ! GHENT Your sister-in-law 's telegram was forwarded to me here . I let her think it brought me , but as a matter of fact , I came East in the next train after yours . It was a rather lowlived thing to do , I suppose , hanging about and bribing your servant for news  --  Ruth lets her head sink in her hands . He pauses and continues ruefullyI might have known how that would strike you ! Well , it would have come out sooner or later .  --  That 's not what I started to talk about .  --  You ask me to suffer for my wrong . Since you left me I have suffered  --  God knows ! You ask me to make some sacrifice . Well  --  how would the mine do ? Since I 've been away they 've as good as stolen it from me . I could get it back easy enough by fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll start all over again , just as we stand in our shoes , and make another fortune  --  for our boy . Ruth utters a faint moan as her head sinks in her arms on the table . With trembling hands , Ghent caresses her hair lightly , and speaks between a laugh and a sobLittle mother ! Little mother ! What does the past matter , when we 've got the future  --  and him ? Ruth does not move . He remains bending over her for some moments , then straightens up , with a gesture of stoic despairI know what you 're saying there to yourself , and I guess you 're right . Wrong is wrong , from the moment it happens till the crack of doom , and all the angels in Heaven , working overtime , ca n't make it less or different by a hair . That seems to be the law . I 've learned it hard , but I guess I 've learned it . I 've seen it written in mountain letters across the continent of this life .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashed to hell is smashed to hell . We fuss and potter and patch up . You might as well try to batter down the Rocky Mountains with a rabbit 's heart-beat ! He goes to the door , where he turnsYou 've fought hard for me , God bless you for it .  --  But it 's been a losing game with you from the first !  --  You belong here , and I belong out yonder  --  beyond the Rockies , beyond  --  the Great Divide ! He opens the door and is about to pass out . Ruth looks up with streaming eyes p. 91 RUTH Wait ! He closes the door and stands waiting for her to speak . Ruth masters herself and goes on , her eyes shining , her face exaltedTell me you know that if I could have followed you , and been your wife , without struggle and without bitterness , I would have done it . GHENT SolemnlyI believe you would . RUTH Tell me you know that when I tore down with bleeding fingers the life you were trying to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved you ! GHENT Comes slowly to the table , looking at her with bewildermentHow was that ? RUTH O , I do n't wonder you ask ! Another woman would have gone straight to her goal . You might have found such a one . But instead you found me , a woman in whose ears rang night and day the cry of an angry Heaven to us both  --  " Cleanse yourselves ! " And I went about doing it in the only way I knew  --  She points at the portraits on the wall --  the only way my fathers knew  --  by wretchedness , by self-torture , by trying blindly to pierce your careless heart with pain . And all the while you  --  O , as I lay there and listened to you , I realized it for the first time  --  you had risen , in one hour , to a wholly new existence , which flooded the present and the future with brightness , yes , and reached back into our past , and made of it  --  made of all of it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes closerYou have taken the good of our life and grown strong . I have taken the evil and grown weak , weak unto death . Teach me to live as you do ! She puts the chain around her neck p. 92 GHENT Puzzled , not yet realizing the full force of her wordsTeach you  --  to live  --  as I do ? RUTH And teach  --  him ! GHENT Unable to realize his fortuneYou 'll let me help make a kind of a happy life for  --  the little rooster ? RUTH Holds out her arms , her face flooded with happiness
