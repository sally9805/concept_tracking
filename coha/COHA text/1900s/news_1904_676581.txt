txt After figuring in several skirmishes and two battles yesterday the fighting zouaves of Col. Gruber 's army of Republican Vetera.ns went into camp last night at Wood 's Court House , otherwise known as the Twelfth Municipal Court Building , on Broadway , near One Hundredth Street . It seems that when Col. Gruber declared war on the Citizens ' Union , just before the last election , the Citizens ' Union forces joined those of Coe Murphy and fought in the Tammany army on election day . That battle resulted in a victory by which Alfred P. W. Seaman , a Citizens ' Union lieutenant , was elected Justice of the court . The court had been established by Col. Gruber 's lieutenant , Frederick E.I. Wood , who , as a member of the Legislature , introduced the bill creating it . Lieutenant Wood was then appointed Chief Clerk of the court , and resigned his position as Assemblyman to-take the job , because he thought it would be good for many years to come . Inasmuch as the district was overwhelmingly Republican , Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charles F. Bruder , one of Col. Gruber 's fighting Captains , who had been appointed Assistant Clerk , thought so , too . But yesterday Justice Seaman appeared at the Court House with James W. Giloon and John Service , whom he had appointed in the places of Wood and Bruder . Lieut . Wood and Capt . Bruder were prepared tor battle . They had seized all the ammunition in sight , including court blanks , dispossess warrant papers , summonses , complaints , and the official seal of the court . They had also sent out a diplomatic note to the effect that no persons could be appointed in their places as court clerks , unless Trim the civil service list . There being no civil list ready , they claimed that they were still clerks Ly the law of . .. over . " Justice Seaman sent out scouts for reinforcements , being satisfied that a bitter war was to be waged . He pressed into service the police of the West One Hundredth Street Station , and then sent an ultimatum to Lieut . Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with the ammunition that had ' leen seized , and to act immediately . " Pooh : " said Lieut . Wood . " Let ' em fight us .

Any cemmunications the enemy has to make to us must come through our Consul General . " Lieut . Wood and Capt . Bruder then barricaded the doors of the clerk 's office just off the court room , and waited for the . enemy to make an attack . Justice Seaman sent his officers , Giloon and Service , under a flag of truce to demand the court ammunition which had been I seized . " Who comes there ? " shouted Court Of1 fiver Fisher , who was doing picket duty . - Service , " came the answer . " Civil Service : " " No ; John Service .

" He said John Service , " replied the picket . - Go back , " commanded Wood , " and say to him that he will get in trouble if he tries to force leis way into the fort without first obtaining the proper password . Remember , it is Civil Service . " Guard Fisher returned to the door and reported that no kind of service could get into the tort excepting the Civil Service brand , Justice Seaman and his man Giloon then approached the door and rapped for admittance . The Justice threatened to courtmarshal the forces inside , whom he referred to as rebels . There was no reply to this . Justice Seaman and his lieutenant listened at the keyhole . Just then they heard the voice of Lieut . Wood , who said : ? ? Is the safe safe ? " " The safe is safe , " answered Bruder , " and the seal is sealed . " - We need the seal to hold court : " shouted Justice Seaman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hold court without us . " " Without us , " added Bruder. and " Without us " was echoed and re-echoed along the skirmishing line of Wood 's fighters . Justice Seaan called a council , and it was decided o apply to other forts for new court a ' munition . Messengers were hurriedly dispatched to a neighboring court , and they brought new court blanks . By the time they got back reinforcements in the shape of a regiment of police , Conslating of Patrolman Farley in command of himself , arrived on the battle ground . " I came to preserve the peace , " said Farley . i Upon hearing this , Lieut . Wood decided to leave the fort and go in search of rations . He left the court house at 2 o'clock . Justice Seaman also retreated for rations . Capt . Bruder remained on guard until Wood came back . . When Justice Seaman returned he went into the big courtroom and proceeded to the rostrum , where he rapped for order , This court is now convened , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two cases were quickly disposed of . About the time Capt . Bruder got a furlough to procure rations . Then Justice , Seaman ordered the janitor of the Court House to lock the doors so that the Wood forces could not pass in or out . Wood , however , executed a flank movement and discovered a side door which led into the public hall from the room in which his forces were camped . After that he remained in charge of the Clerk 's office and the policeman walked up and down in the snow opposite the Court House , while Fisher agreed to remain on guard for a week if necessary to hold the fort . At midnight Fisher was holding the fort , the Wood forces having retired to sleep at their homes .
