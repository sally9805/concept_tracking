txt If the decision of Judge CAYTRAUS of the Superior Court , in Chicago , be generally sustained in the matter of prices during " corners , " it will be followed . by a revolution on all the Exchanges of the country , or by a change in the law . The decision as reported is practically against all dealings in futures . It is to the effect that a contract to pay a certain price for commodities at a future designated date can not be enforced if the actual price of the commodities at the time of the agreement is lower than the price agreed trpon . The reasoning on which the decision is based is not given in the dispatches , but it is probable that the Judge , if he did not rely on some special provision of the Illinois statutes , depended on the general proposition that the contracts involved were contrary to public policy as being essentially of the nature of gambling agreements . That is a popular view , and it is held by some serious authorities In economic ethics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a , court of standing . The line between gambling and certain sorts of commercial and financial speculation is not clearlyto be drawn in all cases . But so far as transactions on the Exchanges are concerned , the distinction lies in the fact that the dealer in futures knows in advance that he must be prepared to make or take delivery of the commodities ' involved at the prices agreed upon or settle the difference . If that is not a definite element in the transaction , it is not suited to any mate Exchange and descends to the level of the bucket shop or the poolroom . Of course prices may be affected by manipulation , and that is known to all ** and enters into their calculations . The mere fact that a man stakes his money on his judgment as to a change in price within a certain period does not make him a gambler . If it did , trade would be reduced to barter , and even barter would have the gambling element in it , since the production of anything , grain , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the willingness of some one else to take it for cloth or what not . It is not likely that the decision of the Chicago Judge is as sweeping as the first report of it indicates .
