txt " When the Cook County Board of Review completes its work the assessed valuation of real and personal property in the City of Chicago will be found to be approximately $400,000,000 . " On this the tax rate will be 6.7 per cent , furnishing $26,800,000 ? ample money for the schools and for every other taxing body except the city itself , which will be short about $1,000,000 . ? The foregoing statement , made by F. W. Upham of the Board of Review last evening . characterizes the tax situation in the city , on the eve of the last day , under the revenue law , on which protests against assessments can be flied with the board . For six weeks longer the board will be in session hearing the protestants and those who are summoned of the board 's own motion to show why their assessments should not be raised . Tells of Board 's Work . " At the present time , " said Mr. Upham , " the board has added to the real valuation of personal property as it stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been added , but much has been cut off . When we finish our work we will have added at least $85,000,000 , or an assessed valuation at the assessing rate of one-fifth-real values , of 111 ' , 1900,000 to the $78,000,000 of last year . We have hardly begun to consider real estate yet , but we will raise it considerably higher than it was two years ago , when we were uncertain whether we had a 5 per cent limit . We know we have a 5 per cent limit now , and are not afraid to put full valuation o'n property . " I wish the public might understand more fully that the Board of Review is an equalizing and not an assessing body . And , more than that , that we can not tax home corporations . " Before I was elected to the board I had an idea that because a man was very rich he ought to pay an enormously high personal property tax . This talk about ' tax-dodging millionaires ' appealed to me . When I came to study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cites an Example . " Take the case of Marshall Field . Mr. Field is assessed on about $2,500,000 of personal property . Mr. Field , of course , is much richer than that , owning largely in the Pullman company , the Chicago and Alton , the Chicago and Northwestern , and the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy railroads . Those corporations are all organized in this Slate and are taxed by the State on their capital stock . In this city we tax each of them on its personal and real property . The Pullman company , for example , Is assessed about $8.000,000 . So by law the stock of these companies owned by Mr. Field is exempt from taxation . " Even at that Mr. Field stands as an example to show what large schedules are filed here in Chicago . In New York , where the richest men of the country are supposed to live , the largest individual personal assessment is that of J. P. Morgan , $400,000 . Carnegie , Rockefeller , and Russell Sage are each assessed $300,000 . We have many men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spend Cash . " The trouble under the new revenue law is not the amount of tax we can collect , but what we have to do with it . Chicago raises each year about $24,000,000 . That should be ample to provide for all expenses , but it has to be divided up among so many different bodies that eat it . up in executive expenses that it is soon dissipated . " Of the 5 per cent the city 's limit is 2 per cent . As a matter of fact , it will get this year about 1.5 or 1.6 per cent . That will net the city about as mu , h as it had last year , Z6,400,000 , but by the new law the city has to pay Its bond Interest out of that . So it will have only about $3,000,000 left for running expenses . If the taxing bodies could be consolidated there would be enough and to spare . Hampered by " Help . " " The board has been hampered considerably this year by well meant attempts to help us find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in this business three years and we know what we are after and how to get it , and I think I am safe in saying that the efforts of the board will be more productive of good results than those of outsiders have been . Our experience of last week with the list of corporations and their wealth , submitted by an afternoon paper , by following which we would have lost several millions , is an example . Tomorrow we are to have presented what is said to be the membership list of the Chicago club and will meet the members to discuss their assessments . This time I guess there will not be any mistakes , no bell boys or drivers included . We may get something out of them . " Heretofore our work has been rendered difficult because of the failure of the original 5 per cent limit clause , which drove property-owners to cover . But with the amended law we are succeeding without great trouble in bringing out the owners of large estates and in getting proper values on realty . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view some people are taking of the aituation . " It is better than it was
