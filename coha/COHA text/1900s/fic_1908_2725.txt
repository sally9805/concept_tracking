' " ( page 54 ) Frontispiece Brock 24 Katherine 44 " She began to detect a decided falling off in his ardour " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply " 98 THE HUSBANDS OF EDITH CHAPTER I HUSBANDS AND WIFE Brock was breakfasting out-of-doors in the cheerful little garden of the Hotel Chatham . The sun streamed warmly upon the concrete floor of the court just beyond the row of palms and oleanders that fringed the rail against which his Herald rested , that he might read as he ran , so to speak . He was the only person having dejeuner on the " terrace , " as he named it to the obsequious waiter who always attended him . Charles was the magnet that drew Brock to the Chatham ( that excellent French hotel with the excellent English name ) . It is beside the question to remark that one is obliged to reverse the English when directing a cocher to the Chatham . The Paris cabman looks blank and more than usually unintelligent when directed to drive to the Chatham , but his face radiates with joy when his fare is inspired to substitute Sha-t'am , with distinct emphasis on the final syllable . Then he cracks his whip and lashes his sorry nag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the Rue Daunou . The street is so short that he almost invariably takes one to it instead of to the hotel itself . But one must say Sha-t'am ! Charles was standing , alert but pensive , quite near at hand , ready to replenish the bowl with honey ( Brock was especially fond of it ) , but with his eyes cocked inquiringly , even eagerly , in the direction of an upstairs window across the court , beyond which a thoughtless guest of the establishment was making her toilette in blissful ignorance of the fact that the flimsy curtains were not tightly drawn . Brock had gone to the Chatham for years just because Charles was a fixture there . Charles spoke the most execrably picturesque English , served with a punctiliousness that savoured almost of the overbearing , and boasted that he had acquired the art of making American cocktails in the Waldorf during a five weeks ' residence in the United States . It was a lazy morning . Brock was happy . He was even interested when a porter came forth and unravelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly began to splash water upon the concrete surface of the court without regard for distance or direction . Moreover , he proceeded to water the palms at Brock 's elbow , operating from a spot no less than twenty feet away . He likewise was casting inquiring glances at divers windows -- few if any at the plants -- until the faithful Charles restored him to earth by means of certain subdued injunctions and less moderate gesticulations , from which it could be readily gathered that " M'sieur was eating , not bathing . " Whereupon the utterly uncrushed porter splashed water at right angles , much to Brock 's relief , while all his fellow porters , free or engaged , took up the quarrel with rare disregard for cause or justice . A femme de chambre , from a convenient window , joined in the hubbub without in the least knowing what it was all about . Monsieur 's comfort must be preserved : that seemed to be the issue in which , at once , all were united . " M'sieur will pardon the boy , " apologised Charles in deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very warm to-day . Your serviette , M'sieur -- it is damp . Pardon ! " He flew away and back with another napkin . " Of course , M'sieur , the Chatham is not the Waldorf , " he announced deprecatingly . " Parbleu , " beating himself on the forehead , " I forgot ! M'sieur does not like the Waldorf . Eh , bien , Paris is not New York , no . " Having sufficiently humbled Paris , he withdrew into the background , rubbing his hands as if he were cleansing them of something unsightly . Brock spread one of the buttered biscuits with honey and inwardly admitted that Paris was not New York . He was a good-looking chap of thirty or thereabouts , an American to the core ,  - -  bright- eyed , keen-witted , smooth-faced , virile . From boyhood 's earliest days he had spent a portion of his summers in Europe . Two or three years of his life had been employed in the Beaux Arts ,  - -  fruitful years , for Brock had not wasted his opportunities . He had gone in for architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in New York ,  - -  prosperous , successful , and a menace to the old cry that a son of the rich can not thrive in his father 's domain . Nowadays he came to the Old World for his breathing spells . He was able to combine dawdling and development without sacrificing one for the other , wherein lies the proof that his vacations were not akin to those taken by most of us . The fortnight in Paris was to be followed by a week in St. Petersburg and a brief tour of Sweden and Norway . His stay in the gay city was drawing to a close . That very morning he expected to book for St. Petersburg , leaving in three days . Suddenly his glance fell upon a name in the society column before him , " Roxbury Medcroft . " His face lighted up with genuine pleasure . An old friend , a boon companion in bygone days , was this same Medcroft ,  - -  a broad-minded , broad-gauged young Englishman who had profited by a stay of some years in the States . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . This is what he read : " Mr. and Mrs. Roxbury Medcroft , of London , are stopping at the Ritz , en route to Vienna . Mr. Medcroft will attend the meeting of Austrian Architects , to be held there next week , and , with his wife , will afterwards spend a fortnight in the German Alps , the guests of the Alfred Rodneys , of Seattle . " " Dear old Rox , I must look him up at once , " mused Brock . " The Rodneys of Seattle ? Never heard of ' em . " He looked at his watch , signed his check , deposited the usual franc , acknowledged Charles 's well-practised smile of thanks , and pushed back his chair , his gaze travelling involuntarily toward the portals of the American bar across the court , just beyond the concierge 's quarters . Simultaneously a tall figure emerged from the bar , casting eager glances in all directions ,  - -  a tall figure in a checked suit , bowler hat , white reindeer gloves , high collar , and grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monocle dropped from the other 's eye , and his long legs carried him eagerly toward the American . " Medcroft ! Bless your heart ! I was just on the point of looking you up at the Ritz . It 's good to see you , " Brock cried as they clasped hands . " Of all the men and of all the times , Brock , you are the most opportune , " exclaimed the other . " I saw that you were here and bolted my breakfast to catch you . These beastly telephones never work . Oh , I say , old man , have you finished yours ? " " Quite -- but luckily I did n't have to bolt it . You 're off for Vienna , I see . Sit down , Rox . Wo n't you have another egg and a cup of coffee ? Do ! " " Thanks and no to everything you suggest . Wot you doing for the next half-hour or so ? I 'm in a deuce of a dilemma and you 've got to help me out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it nervously as he replaced it in his upper coat pocket . " That 's a good fellow , Brock . You will be the ever present help in time of trouble , wo n't you ? " " My letter of credit is at your disposal , old man , " said Brock promptly . He meant it . It readily may be seen from this that their friendship is no small item to be considered in the development of this tale . " My dear fellow , that 's the very thing I 'm eager to thrust upon you -- my letter of credit , " exclaimed the other . " What 's that ? " demanded Brock . " I say , Brock , ca n't we go up to your rooms ? Dead secret , you know . Really , old chap , I mean it . No one must get a breath of it . That 's why I 'm whispering . I 'm not a lunatic , so do n't stare like that . I 'd do as much for you if the conditions were reversed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what the devil is it you want me to do ? " " Do I appear to be agitated ? " " Well , I should say so . " " Well , I am . You know how I loathe asking a favour of anyone . Besides , it 's rather an extraordinary one I 'm going to ask of you . Came to me in a flash this morning when I saw your name in the paper . Sort of inspiration , ' pon my word . I think Edith sees it the same as I , although I have n't had time to go into it thoroughly with her . She 's ripping , you know ; pluck to the very core . " Brock 's face expressed bewilderment and perplexity . " Wo n't you have another drink , old man ? " he asked gently . " Another ? Hang it all , I have n't had one in a week . Come along . I must talk it all over with you before I introduce you to her . You must be prepared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pricking up his ears . He was following Medcroft to the elevator . " To my wife -- Edith , " said Medcroft , annoyed by the other 's obtuseness . " Does it require preparation for an ordeal so charming ? " laughed Brock . He was recalling the fact that Medcroft had married a beautiful Philadelphia girl some years ago in London , a young lady whom he had never seen , so thoroughly expatriated had she become in consequence of almost a lifetime residence in England . He remembered now that she was rich and that he had sent her a ridiculously expensive present and a congratulatory cablegram at the time of the wedding . Also , it occurred to him that the Medcrofts had asked him to visit them at their shooting-box for several seasons in succession , and that their town house was always open to him . While he had not ignored the invitations , he had never responded in person . He began to experience twinges of remorse : Medcroft was such a good fellow ! The Londoner did not respond to the innocuous query @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the succeeding etages as they slipped downward . At the fourth floor they disembarked , and Brock led the way to his rooms , overlooking the inner court . Once inside , with the door closed , he turned upon the Englishman . " Now , what 's up , Rox ? Are you in trouble ? " he demanded . " Are we quite alone ? " Medcroft glanced significantly at the transom and the half-closed bathroom door . With a laugh , Brock led him into the bathroom and out , and then closed the transom . " You 're darned mysterious , " he said , pointing to a chair near the window . Medcroft drew another close up and seated himself . " Brock , " he said , lowering his voice and leaning forward impressively , " I want you to go to Vienna in my place . " Brock stared hard . " You are a godsend , old man . You 're just in time to do me the greatest of favours . It 's utterly impossible for me to go to Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwise for me to give up the project . You see , I 've just got to be in London and Vienna at the same time . " " It will require something more than a stretch of the imagination to do that , old man . But I 'm game , and my plans are such that they can be changed readily to oblige a friend . I sha n't mind the trip in the least and I 'll be only too happy to help you out ! ' Gad , I thought by your manner that you were in some frightful difficulty . Have a cigaret . " " By Jove , Brock , you 're a brick , " cried Medcroft , shaking the other 's hand vigorously . At the same time his face expressed considerable uncertainty and no little doubt as to the further welfare of his as yet partially divulged proposition . " It 's easy to be a brick , my boy , if it involves no more than the changing of a single letter in one 's name . I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , you see , Brock , " said Medcroft lamely , " I fear you do n't quite appreciate the situation . I want you to pose as Roxbury Medcroft . " " You -- What do you mean ? " " I thought you 'd find that a facer . That 's just it : you are to go to Vienna as Roxbury Medcroft , not as yourself . Ha , ha ! Ripping , eh ? " " ' Pon my soul , Rox , you are not in earnest ? " " Never more so . " " But , my dear fellow --  " " You wo n't do it ? That 's what your tone means , " in despair . " It is n't that , and you know it . I 've got nothing to lose . It 's you that will have to suffer . You 're known all over Europe . What will be said when the trick is discovered ? ' Gad , man ! " " Then you will go ? " with beaming eyes . " I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What does it all mean ? " " It 's all very simple , if one looks at it from the right angle , Brock . Up to last night , I was blissfully committed to the most delightful of outings , so to speak . At ten o'clock everything was changed . Mrs. Medcroft and I sat up all night discussing the situation with the messenger -- my solicitor , by the way . The Vienna trip is out of the question , so far as I am concerned . It is of vital importance that I should return to London to-night , but is even more vitally important that the world should say that I am in Vienna . See what I mean ? " " No , I 'm hanged if I do . " " What I have just heard from London makes me shudder to think of the consequences if I go on east to-night . I may as well tell you that there is a plot on foot to perpetrate a gigantic fraud against the people . The County Council is to be hoodwinked out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people 's money . Our firm has opposed a certain band of grafters , and when I left England it was pretty well settled that we had blocked their game . They have learned of my proposed absence and intend to steal a march on us while I am away . Without assuming too much credit to myself , I may say that I , your old friend , Roxbury , I am the one man who has proved the real thorn in the sides of these scoundrels . With me out of the way , they feel that they can secure the adoption of all these infamous measures . My partners and the leaders on our side have sent for me to return secretly . They wo n't bring the matter to issue if they find that I 've returned ; it would be suicidal . Therefore it is necessary that we steal a march on ' em . I know the inside workings of the scheme . If I can steal back and keep under cover as an advisory chief , so to speak , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for then we can spring the coup and defeat them for good and all . But , do n't you see , old man , unless they know that I 've gone to Vienna they wo n't undertake the thing . That 's why I 'm asking you to go on to Vienna and pose as Roxbury Medcroft while I steal back to London and set the charge under these demmed bloodsuckers . Really , you know , it 's a terribly serious matter , Brock . It means fortune and honour to me , as well as millions to the rate-payers of Greater London . All you 've got to do is to register at the Bristol , get interviewed by the papers , attend one or two sessions of the convention , which lasts three days , and then go off into the mountains with the Rodneys ,  - -  the society reporters will do the rest . " " With the Rodneys ? My dear fellow , suppose that they object to the substitution ! Really , you know , it 's not to be thought of . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to know that there has been a substitution . Perfectly simple , ca n't you see ? " " I 'm damned if I do . " " What a stupid ass you are , Brock ! The Rodneys have never laid eyes on me . They know of me as Edith 's husband , that 's all . They are to take you in as Medcroft , of course . " At this point Brock set up an emphatic remonstrance . He began by laughing his friend to scorn ; then , as Medcroft persisted , went so far as to take him severely to task for the proposed imposition on the unsuspecting Rodneys , to say nothing of the trick he would play upon the convention of architects . " I 'd be recognised as an impostor , " he said warmly , " and booted out of the convention . I shudder to think of what Mr. Rodney will do to me when he learns the truth . Why , Medcroft , you must be crazy . There will be dozens of architects there who know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , if they do n't see me there , they ca n't very well recognise me , can they ? If necessary , you can affect an illness and stay away from the sessions altogether . Give a statement to the press from the privacy of the sickroom -- regret your inability to take part in the discussions , and all that , you know . Hire a nurse , if necessary . You might venture to express an opinion or two on vital topics , in my name . I do n't care a hang what you say . I only want ' em to think I 'm there . No doubt our enemies will have a spy or two hanging about to see that I am actually off for a jaunt with the Rodneys , but they will be Viennese and they wo n't know me from Adam . What 's the odds , so long as Edith is there to stand by you ? If she 's willing to assume that you are her husband --  " " Good Lord ! " half shouted Brock , leaping to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she is -- is -- is to go to Vienna with me ? " " Emphatically , yes . She 's also invited . Of course , she 's going . " " You mean that she 's going just as you are going -- by proxy ? " murmured Brock helplessly . " Proxy , the devil ! ' Pon my soul , Brock , you 're downright stupid . She ca n't have a proxy . They know her . The Rodneys are in some way connections of hers , and all that -- third cousins . If she is n't there to vouch for you , how the deuce can you expect to --  " " Medcroft , you are crazy ! No one but an insane man would submit his wife to -- Why , good Lord , man , think of the scandal ! She wo n't have a shred left --  " " At the proper time the matter will be explained to the Rodneys , not at first , you know ,  - -  and I 'll be in a position to step into your shoes before the party returns to Paris . Afterwards the whole trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a heroine . " " I 'm absolutely paralysed ! " mumbled Brock . " Brace up , old chap . I 'm going to take you around to the Ritz at once to introduce you to my wife -- to your wife , I might say . She 'll be waiting for us , and , take my word for it , she 's in for the game . She appreciates its importance . Come now , Brock , it means so little to you , and it means everything to me . You will do this for me ? For us ? " For ten minutes Brock protested , his argument growing weaker and weaker as the true humour of the project developed in his mind . He came at last to realise that Medcroft was in earnest , and that the situation was as serious as he pictured it . The Englishman 's plea was unusual , but it was not as rattle-brained as it had seemed at the outset . Brock was beginning to see the possibilities that the ruse contained ; to say the least , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its miscarriage . In spite of possible unpleasant consequences , there were the elements of a rare lark in the enterprise ; he felt himself being skilfully guided past the pitfalls and dangers . " I shall insist upon talking it over thoroughly with Mrs. Medcroft before consenting , " he said in the end . " If she 's being bluffed into the game , I 'll revoke like a flash . If she 's keen for the adventure , I 'll go , Rox . But I 've got to see her first and talk it all over --  " " ' Pon my word , old chap , she 's ripping , awfully good sort , even though I say it myself . She 's true blue , and she 'll do anything for me . You see , Brock , " and his voice grew very tender , " she loves me . I 'm sure of her . There is n't a nobler wife in the world than mine . Nor a prettier one , either , " he concluded , with fine pride in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will be proud of the chance to point her out as your wife , take my word for it . " Then they set out for the Ritz . " Roxbury , " said Brock soberly , when they were in the Rue de la Paix , after walking two blocks in contemplative silence , " my peace of mind is poised at the brink of an abyss . I have a feeling that I am about to chuck it over . " " Nonsense . You 'll buck up when Edith has had a fling at you . " " I suppose I 'm to call her Edith . " " Certainly , and I wo n't mind a ' dear ' or two when it seems propitious . It 's rather customary , you know , even among the unhappily married . Of course , I 've always been opposed to kissing or caressing in public ; it 's so middle-class . " " And I daresay Mrs. Medcroft will object to it in private , " lamented Brock good-naturedly . " I daresay , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public only . By the way , you 'll have to get used to the name of Roxbury . Do n't look around as if you expected to find me standing behind your back when she says , ' Roxbury , dear ! ' I sha n't be there , you know . She 'll mean you . Do n't forget that . " " Oh , I say , " exclaimed Brock , halting abruptly , and staring in dismay at the confident conspirator , " will I have to wear a suit of clothes like that , and an eyeglass , and -- and -- good Lord ! spats ? " " By Jove , you shall wear this very suit ! " cried Medcroft , inspired . " We 're of a size , and it wo n't fit you any better than it does me . Our clothes never fit us in London . Clever idea of yours , Brock , to think of it . And , here ! We 'll stop at this shop and pick up a glass . You can have all day for practice with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you can cultivate a -- er -- little more of an English style of speech ? That twang of yours won't --  " " Heavens , man , I 'm to be a low comedian , too , " gasped Brock , as he was fairly pushed onto the shop . Three minutes later they were on the sidewalk , and Brock was in possession of an object he had scorned most of all things in the world ,  - -  a monocle . Arm in arm , they sauntered into the Ritz . Medcroft retained his clasp on his friend 's elbow as they went up in the lift , after the fashion of one who fears that his victim is contemplating flight . As they entered the comfortable little sitting-room of the suite , a young woman rose gracefully from the desk at which she had been writing . With perfect composure she smiled and extended her slim hand to the American as he crossed the room with Medcroft 's jerky introduction dinging in his ears . " My old friend Brock , dear . He has consented to be your husband . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? " A blush spread over her exquisite face . " Oh , Roxbury , how embarrassing ! He has n't even proposed to me . So glad to meet you , Mr. Brock . I 've been trying to picture what you would look like , ever since Roxbury went out to find you . Sit here , please , near me . Roxbury , has Mr. Brock really fallen into your terrible trap ? Is n't it the most ridiculous proceeding , Mr. Brock --  " " Call him Roxbury , my dear . He 's fully prepared for it . And now let 's get down to business . He insists upon talking it over with you . You do n't mind me being present , do you , Brock ? I daresay I can help you out a bit . I 've been married four years . " For an hour the trio discussed the situation from all sides and in all its phases . When Brock arose to take his departure , he was irrevocably committed to the enterprise ; he was , moreover , completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stretched before him . He went away with his head full of the brilliant , quick-witted , loyal young American who was entering so heartily into the plot to deceive her own friends for the time being in order that her husband might profit in high places . " She is ripping , " he said to Medcroft in the hallway . All of the plans had been made and all of them had been approved by the young wife . She had shown wonderful perspicacity and foresight in the matter of details ; her capacity for selection and disposal was even more comprehensive than that of the two men , both of whom were somewhat staggered by the boldness of more than one suggestion which came from her fruitful storehouse of romantic ideas . She had grasped the full humour of the situation , from inception to denouement , and , to all appearance , was heart and soul deep in the venture , despising the risks because she knew that succour was always at her elbow in the shape of her husband 's loyal support . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit ; adequate compensation for the merry sacrifice was to be had in the brief detachment from rigid English conventionality , in the hazardous injection of quixotism into an otherwise overly healthful life of platitudes . Society had become the sepulchre of youthful inspirations ; she welcomed the resurrection . The exquisite delicacy with which she analysed the cost and computed the interest won for her the warmest regard of her husband 's friend , fellow conspirator in a plot which involved the subtlest test of loyalty and honour . " Yes , " said Medcroft simply . " You wo n't have reason to change your opinion , Brock . " He hesitated for a moment and then burst out , rather plaintively : " She 's an awfully good sort , demme , she is . And so are you , Brock , it 's mighty decent of you . You 're the only man in all the world that I could or would have asked to do this for me . You are my best friend , Brock , you always have been . " He seized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in a long look of understanding and confidence . " I 'll take good care of her , " said Brock quietly . " I know you will . Good-by , then . I 'll see you late this afternoon . You leave this evening at seven-twenty by the Orient Express . I 've had the reservations booked and -- and --  " He hesitated , a wry smile on his lips , " I daresay you wo n't mind making a pretence of looking after the luggage a bit , will you ? " " I shall take this opportunity to put myself in training against the day when I may be travelling away with a happy bride of my own . By the way , how long am I expected to remain in this state of matrimonial bliss ? That 's no small detail , you know , even though it escaped for the moment . " " Three weeks . " " Three weeks ? " He almost reeled . " That 's a long time in these days of speedy divorces , " said Medcroft blandly . CHAPTER II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Brock appeared , fully half an hour before departing time . In no little dismay , he found himself wondering if the whole of Paris was going away or , on the other hand , if the rest of the continent was arriving . He felt a fool in Medcroft 's unspeakable checked suit ; and the eyeglass was a much more obstinate , untractable thing than he had even suspected it could be . The right side of his face was in a condition of semi-paralysis due to the muscular exactions required ; he had a sickening fear that the scowl that marked his brow was destined to form a perpetual alliance with the smirk at the corner of his nose , forever destroying the symmetry of his face . If one who has not the proper facial construction will but attempt the feat of holding a monocle in place for unbroken hours , he may come to appreciate at least one of the trials which beset poor Brock . Every one seemed to be staring at him . He heard more than one American in the scurrying throng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt relieved until an Englishman or two upset his confidence by brutally alluding to him as a " confounded American toady . " It was quite train time before Mrs. Medcroft was seen hurrying in from the carriage way , pursued by a trio of facteurs , laden with bags and boxes . " Do n't shake hands , " she warned in a quick whisper , as they came together . " I recognised you by the clothes . " " Thank God , it was n't my face ! " he cried . " Are your trunks checked ? " " Yes ,  - -  this afternoon . I have nothing but the bags . You have the tickets ? Then let us get aboard . I just could n't get here earlier , " she whispered guiltily . " We had to say good-by , you know . Poor old Roxy ! How he hated it ! I sent Burton and O'Brien on ahead of me . My sister brought them here in her carriage , and I daresay they 're aboard and abed by this time . You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my maids . How stupid of me ! Do n't be alarmed . They have their instructions , Roxbury . Does n't it sound odd to you ? " Brock was icy-cold with apprehension as they walked down the line of wagon-lits in the wake of the bag-bearers . Mrs. Medcroft was as self-possessed and as degage as he was ill at ease and awkward . As they ascended the steps of the carriage , she turned back to him and said , with the most malicious twinkle in her eyes ,  --  " I 'm not a bit nervous . " " But you 've been married so much longer than I have , " he responded . Then came the disposition of the bags and parcels . She calmly directed the porters to put the overflow into the upper berth . The garde came up to remonstrate in his most rapid French . " But where is M'sieur to sleep if the bags go up there ? " he argued . Mrs. Medcroft dropped her toilet bag and turned to Brock with startled eyes , her lips parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags at his feet , an aroused gleam in his eyes . A deep flush overspread her face ; an expression of utter rout succeeded the buoyancy of the moment before . " Really , " she murmured and could go no farther . The loveliest pucker came into her face . Brock waved the garde aside . " It 's all right , " he explained . " I sha n't occupy the -- I mean , I 'll take one of the other compartments . " As the garde opened his lips to protest , she drew Brock inside the compartment and closed the door . Mrs. Medcroft was agitated . " Oh , what a wretched contretemps ! " she cried in despair . " Roxy has made a frightful mess of it , after all . He has not taken a compartment for you . I'm -- I 'm afraid you 'll have to take this one and -- and let me go in with --  " " Nonsense ! " he broke in . " Nothing of the sort ! I 'll find a bed , never fear . I daresay there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep with the servants . And do n't lie awake blaming poor old Rox . He 's lonesome and unhappy , and he --  " " But he has a place to sleep , " she lamented . " I 'm so sorry , Mr. Brock . It 's perfectly horrid , and I'm -- I 'm dreadfully afraid you wo n't be able to get a berth . Roxbury tried yesterday for a lower for himself . " " And he -- could n't get one ? " " No , Mr. Brock . But I 'll ask the maids to give up their --  " " Please , please do n't worry -- and please do n't call me Mr. Brock . I hate the name . Good night ! Now do n't think about me . I 'll be all right . You 'll find me as gay as a lark in the morning . " He did not give her a chance for further protest , but darted out of the compartment . As he closed the door he had the disquieting impression that she was sitting upon the edge of her berth , giggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate compartment with the dejection of a capable French attendant who is ever ready with joint commiseration and obduracy . No , he was compelled to inform Monsieur the American ( to the dismay of the pseudo-Englishman ) it would be impossible to arrange for another compartment . The train was crowded to its capacity . Many had been turned away . No , a louis would not be of avail . The deepest grief and anguish filled his soul to see the predicament of Monsieur , but there was no relief . Brock 's miserable affectation of the English drawl soon gave way to sharp , emphatic Americanisms . It was after eight o'clock and the train was well under way . The street lamps were getting fewer and fewer , and the soft , fresh air of the suburbs was rushing through the window . " But , hang it all , I ca n't sit up all night ! " growled Brock in exasperated finality . " Monsieur forgets that he has a berth . It is not the fault of the compagnie that he is without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tres bien ! " As the result of strong persuasion , the garde consented to make " the grand tour " of the train de luxe in search of a berth . It goes without saying that he was intensely mystified by Brock 's incautious remark that he would be satisfied with " an upper if he could n't do any better . " For the life of him , Monsieur the garde could not comprehend the situation . He went away , shaking his head and looking at the tickets , as much as to say that an American is never satisfied -- not even with the best . Brock lowered a window-seat in the passage and sat down , staring blankly and blackly out into the whizzing night . The predicament had come upon him so suddenly that he had not until now found the opportunity to analyse it in its entirety . The worst that could come of it , of course , was the poor comfort of a night in a chair . He knew that it was a train of sleeping-coaches -- Ah ! He suddenly remembered the luggage van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the trunks ! And then , too , there was something irritating in the suspicion that she had laughed as if it were a huge joke -- perhaps , even now , she was doubled up in her narrow couch , stifling the giggle that would not be suppressed . When the garde came back with the lugubrious information that nothing , positively nothing , was to be had , it is painful to record that Brock swore in a manner which won the deepest respect of the trainman . " At four o'clock in the morning , M'sieur , an old gentleman and his wife will get out at Strassburg , their destination . They are in this carriage and you may take their compartment , if M'sieur will not object to sleeping in a room just vacated by two mourners who to-day buried a beloved son in Paris . They have kept all of the flowers in their --  " " Four o'clock ! Good Lord , what am I to do till then ? " groaned Brock , glaring with unmanly hatred at the door of the Medcroft compartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ventured the guard timorously , but Brock checked him with a peremptory gesture . He proposed , instead , the luggage van , whereupon the guard burst into a psalm of utter dejection . It was against the rules , irrevocably . " Then I guess I 'll have to sit here all night , " said Brock faintly . He was forgetting his English . " If M'sieur will not occupy his own bed , yes , " said the guard , shrugging his shoulders and washing his hands of the whole incomprehensible affair . " M'sieur will then be up to receive the Customs officers at the frontier . Perhaps he will give me the keys to Madame 's trunks , so that she may not be disturbed . " " Ask her for ' em yourself , " growled Brock , after one dazed moment of dismay . The hours crawled slowly by . He paced the length of the wriggling corridor a hundred times , back and forth ; he sat on every window-seat in the carriage ; he nodded and dozed and groaned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismal night . Daylight came at four ; he saw the sun rise for the first time in his life . He neither enjoyed nor appreciated the novelty . Never had he witnessed anything so mournfully depressing as the first grey tints that crept up to mock him in his vigil ; never had he seen anything so ghastly as the soft red glow that suffused the morning sky . " I 'll sleep all day if I ever get into that damned bed , " he said to himself , bitterly wistful . The Customs officers had eyed him suspiciously at the border . They evidently had been told of his strange madness in refusing to occupy the berth he had paid for . Their examination of his effects was more thorough than usual . It may have entered their heads that he was standing guard over the repose of a fair accomplice . They asked so many embarrassing and disconcerting questions that he was devoutly relieved when they passed on , still suspicious . The train was late , and at five o'clock he was desperately combating an impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , and then , refreshed , set out for London to have it out with the malevolent Medcroft . The disembarking of the venerable mourners , however , restored him to a degree of his peace of mind . After all , he reviewed , it would be cowardly and base to desert a trusting wife ; he pictured her as asleep and securely confident in his stanchness . No : he would have it out with Medcroft at some later day . He was congratulating himself on the acquisition of a bed -- although it might possess the odour of a bed of tuberoses -- when all of his pleasant calculations were upset by the appearance of a German burgher and his family . It was then that he learned that these people had booked le compartement from Strassburg to Munich . Brock resumed his window-seat and despondently awaited the call to breakfast . He fell sound asleep with his monocle in position ; nor did it matter to him that his hat dropped through the window and went scuttling off across the green Rhenish fields . When next he looked at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing at the end of the passage , staring wide-eyed at him . Two little girls came piling , half dressed , from a compartment , evidently in response to the youngster 's whispered command to hurry out and see the funny man . Brock scowled darkly , and the trio darted swiftly into the compartment . He dragged his stiff legs into the dining-car at Stuttgart and shoved them under a table . The car was quite empty . As he was staring blankly at the menu , the conducteur from his car hurried in with the word that Madame would not breakfast until nine . She was still very sleepy . Would Monsieur Medcroft be good enough to order her coffee and rolls brought to her compartment at that hour ? And would he mind seeing that the maid saw to it that Raggles surely had his biscuit and a walk at the next station ? " Raggles ? " queried Brock , passing his hand over his brow . The other shrugged his shoulders and looked askance . " Oh , yes ,  - -  I - -  understand , " murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes he wondered who Raggles could be . He had eaten his strawberries and was waiting for the eggs and coffee , resentfully eying the early risers who were now coming in for their coffee and rolls . They had slept -- he could tell by the complacent manner in which their hair was combed and by the interest they found in the scenery which he had come , by tedious familiarity , to loathe and scorn . The actions of two young women near the door attracted his attention . From their actions he suddenly gathered that they were discussing him ,  - -  and in a more or less facetious fashion , at that . They whispered and looked shy and grinned in a most disconcerting manner . He turned red about the ears and began to wonder , fiercely , why his eggs and coffee were so slow in coming . Then , to his consternation , the young women , plainly of the serving-class , bore down upon him with abashed smiles . He noticed for the first time that one of them was carrying a very small child in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she extended the small one toward the astounded Brock , and said in excellent old English : Illustration : Brock " Good morning , Mr. Medcroft . " Then , with a rare inspiration , " Baby , kiss papa -- come , now . " She pushed the infant almost into Brock 's face . He did not observe that it was a beautiful child and that it had a look of terror in its eyes ; he only knew that he was glaring wildly at the fiendish nurse , the truth slowly beating its way into his be-addled brain . For a full minute he stared as if petrified . Then , administering a sickly grin , he sought to bring his wits up to the requirements of the extraordinary situation . He lifted his hand and mumbled : " Come , Raggles ! I have n't a biscuit , but here , have a roll , do . Give me a -- a kiss ! " He added the last in most heroic surrender . The nurse and the maid stared hard at him ; the baby turned in affright to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Lord , sir , " whispered the nurse , with a nervous glance about her ; " this ai n't Raggles , sir . This is a baby . " " Do you think I 'm blind , madam ? " whispered he , savagely . " I can see it 's a baby , but I did n't know there was to be one . Its father did n't mention it to me . " " It 's a wise father that knows his own child , " said the nurse , with prompt sarcasm . " I think they should have prepared me for this , " growled he . " Is it supposed to be mine ? Does -- does Mrs. Medcroft know about it ? " " You mean , about the baby , sir ? Of course she does . It 's hers . Please do n't look so odd , sir . My word , sir , I did n't know you did n't know it , sir . I was n't told , was I , O'Brien ? There , sir , you see ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , sir . She said --  " " Tootles ? " murmured Brock . " Tootles and Raggles . I daresay there 's a distinction without much of a difference . Are you Burton ? " " Yes , Mr. Medcroft . The nurse . Wo n't you take baby for a minute , sir ? Just to get acquainted , and for appearance 's sake . " She whispered the well-meant entreaty . Brock , now well into the spirit of the situation , obligingly extended his arms . The baby set up a lusty howl of aversion . " For God 's sake , take him back to his mother ! " groaned Brock hastily . " He does n't like strangers ! Take him away ! " " It is n't a he , sir , " whispered the maid , as the nurse prepared to beat a hasty retreat with the Medcroft offspring . " It 's a her , sir . " Brock 's face was a study in perplexity as they hurried from the car . " By George , " he muttered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even more amazing than the unexpected advent of Tootles . He barely had recovered his equanimity -- with his coffee -- when a young lady entered the car . That , of itself , was not much to speak of , but what followed was something that not even he could have dreamed of if he had been given the chance . He afterward recalled , in some distress of mind , that his second quick glance at the newcomer developed into little less than a rude stare of admiration . Small wonder , let it be advanced in his defence . She was astoundingly fair to look upon -- dazzling , it might be said , with some support to the adjective . Moreover , she was looking directly into his eyes from her unstable position near the door ; what was more , a shy , even mischievous , smile crept into her face as her glance caught his . Never had he seen a more exquisite face than hers ; never had he looked upon a more perfect picture of grace and loveliness and -- aye , smartness . She was smiling with unmistakable friendliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not seen her before in his life . As if he could have forgotten such a face ! A sudden sense of enchantment swept over him , indescribable , yet delicious . She was coming toward him -- still smiling shyly , her lips parted as if she were breathing quickly from fear or another emotion . He set down his coffee-cup without regard to taste or direction , his gaze fixed upon the trim , slender figure in blue . He now saw that her dark eyes were filled with a soft seriousness that belied her brave smile ; a delicate pink had come into her clear , high-bred face ; the hesitancy of the gentlewoman enveloped her with a mantle that shielded her from any suspicion of boldness . Brock struggled to his feet , amazement written in his face . " Good morning , Roxbury , " she said , in the most impersonal of greetings . Her smile deepened as the blankness increased in his face . In the most casual , matter-of-fact manner , she appropriated the chair across the table from his . " Please sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a single , tense , abashed moment they looked searchingly into each other 's eyes . " Are you Raggles ? " he asked politely . " You poor man ! " she cried , aghast . " Raggles is Edith 's French poodle . Has no one told you of the poodle ? " She half whispered this . He began to adore her at that very moment ,  - -  a circumstance well worth remembering . " No one has told me of you , for that matter , " he apologised , thrilling with a delight such as he had never known before . " Would you mind whispering to me just who you are ? Am I supposed to be your father -- or what ? " " It is all so delightfully casual , is n't it ? " she said . " I daresay they forgot to tell you that you are a man of family . Did n't they mention me in any way at all ? " She pouted very prettily . " No , they ignored you and Raggles and Tootles . Are there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You see , we got to the station quite a bit ahead of Edith . That 's how you happened to miss meeting us . We saw you there , however . I recognised you by your clothes . You seemed very unhappy . Oh , I forgot . You wanted to know who I am . Well , I am your sister-in-law . " She ordered coffee and toast while he sat there figuring it out . When the waiter departed , he leaned forward and said quite frankly ,  --  " You 'll pardon me , I 'm sure , but I ca n't understand how I was so short-sighted as to marry your sister . " " Well , you see , you did n't catch a glimpse of me until after you were married , " she railed . " I was in the Sacred Heart convent , you remember . " " Ah , that explains the oversight . I am considered an unusually discriminating person . Let me see : I married a Miss Fowler , did n't I ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at St. George 's , in Hanover Square , at four o'clock , on a Saturday . Did n't they tell you all that ? " " I do n't think they said anything about it being four o'clock . I 'm glad to know the awful details , believe me . Thanks ! Do you know I decided you were an American the instant I saw you in the door , " he went on , quite irrelevantly . " How clever of you , Roxbury ! " " Oh , I say , Miss Fowler , I 'm not such an ass as I look , really I 'm not . I 'm trying to look like --  " " ' Sh ! If you want me to believe you are not the ass you think you look , be careful what you say . Remember I am not Miss Fowler to you . I am Constance -- sometimes Connie . Can you remember that ,  - -  Roxbury ? " He drew a long breath . " Oh , I say , Connie , I 'd much rather be plain Brock to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this for my sister , not for myself , by any manner of means , " she said stiffly . He flushed painfully , conscious of the rebuke . " Please overlook my faults for the time being , " he said . " I 'll do better . You see , I 've been rather overcome by the sense of my own importance . I 'm not used to being the head of an establishment . It has dazed me . A great many things have happened to me since I left the Gare de l'Est last night . " He was considerate in not referring to his unhappy mode of travelling . " For instance , I 've completely lost my head . " He might have said hat , but that would have sounded commonplace and earthy . " One does , you know , when he loses his identity , " she said sympathetically . " Edith says you are ripping , and all that sort of thing , " she went on hurriedly , in perfect mimicry . " You come very highly recommended as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us until the end of the play ? " " Yes . The Rodneys are my friends , not Edith 's . Katherine Rodney was in the convent with me . We see a great deal of each other . I 'm sure you will like her . Everybody falls dreadfully in love with her . " " How very amiable of you to permit it , " he protested gallantly . " I 'm sure I shall enjoy falling in love . Which reminds me that I 've never had a sister-in-law . They 're very nice , I 'm told . It 's odd that Medcroft did n't tell me about you . Would you mind advancing a bit of general information about yourself -- and , I may say , about my family in general ? It may come handy . " " I feel as though I had known you for years , " she said , frankly returning his gaze . She leaned forward , her elbows on the table , her chin in her hands . " I 'm merely Edith 's sister . We live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years younger than Edith . Of course , you know how old your wife is , so we wo n't dwell upon that . You do n't ? Then I 'd demand it of her . I have n't been in Philadelphia since I was seven -- and that 's ages ago . I have no mother , and father is off in South America on business . So , you see , little sister has to tag after big sister . Oh ! " She interrupted the recital with an abrupt change of manner . " I 'm so sorry you 've finished your coffee . Now you 'll have to go . Roxbury always does . " " But I have n't finished , " he exclaimed eagerly . " I 'm going to have three or four more pots . You have no idea how --  " " It 's all right then , " she said with her rarest and most confident smile . " Well , Edith asked me to come to London for the season . The Rodneys were in Paris at the time , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortnight in the Tyrol . When I said that I was off for a visit with the -- with you , I mean -- they insisted that you all should come too . They are connections , in a way , do n't you see . So we accepted . And here we are . " " You do n't , by any chance , happen to be engaged to be married , or anything of that sort , " he ventured . " Do n't crush me ! It 's only as a safeguard , you know . People may ask questions . " " You are not obliged to answer them , Roxbury , " she said . The flush had deepened in her cheek . It convinced him that she was in love -- and engaged . He experienced a queer sinking of the heart . " You can say that you do n't know , if anyone should be so rude as to ask . " Suddenly she caught her breath and stared at him in a sort of panic . " Heavens , " she whispered , the toast poised half-way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , engaged , are you ? Appalling thought ! " He laughed delightedly . " People wo n't ask about me , my dear Constance . I 'm already married , you know . But if anyone should ask , you 're not obliged to answer . " She looked troubled and uncertain . " You may be really married , after all , " she speculated . " Who knows ? Poor old Roxbury would n't have had the tact to inquire . " " I am a henpecked bachelor , believe me . " For the next quarter of an hour they chatted in the liveliest , most inconsequential fashion , getting on excellent terms with each other and arriving at a fair sense of appreciation of what lay ahead of them in the shape of peril and adventure . She was the most delightful person he had ever met , as well as being the most beautiful . There was a sprightly , ever-growing air of self-reliance about her that charmed and reassured him . She possessed the capacity for divining the sane and the ridiculous with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious with an impartial intelligence that gratified his vanity without in the least inspiring the suspicion that she was merely clever . He became blissfully imbued with the idea that she had surprised herself by the discovery that he was really quite attractive . In fact , he was quite sincerely pleased with himself -- for which he may be pardoned if one stops to think how resourceful a woman of tact may be if she is very , very pretty . And , by way of further analogy , Brock was a thoroughly likable chap , beside being handsome and a thoroughbred to the core . It 's not betraying a secret to affirm , cold-bloodedly , that Miss Fowler had not allied herself with the enterprise until after she had pinned Roxbury down to facts concerning Brock 's antecedents . She was properly relieved to find that he came of a fine old family and that he had led more than one cotillion in New York . He experienced a remarkable change of front in respect to Roxbury Medcroft before the breakfast was over . It may have been due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice , but it remains an unchallenged fact that he no longer thought of Medcroft as a stupid bungler ; instead , he had come to regard him as a good and irreproachable Samaritan . All of which goes to prove that a divinity shapes our ends , rough hew them how we may . " I 'm sure we shall get on famously , " he said , as she signified her desire to return to the compartment . " I 've always longed for a nice , agreeable sister-in-law . " " Her mission in life , up to a certain stage , is to make the man appreciate the fact that he has , after all , been snapped up by a small but deserving family , " she said blithely . " It is also her duty to pour oil on troubled waters and strew flowers along the connubial highway , so long as her kind offices are not resented . By the way , Roxbury , I am now about to preserve you from bitter reproaches . You have forgotten to order coffee and rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ! It 's nine o'clock . " He ordered the coffee and rolls to be sent in at once . " I hope she has n't starved to death . " " My dear Roxbury , " she said sternly , " I must take you under my wing . You have much to accomplish in the next twenty-four hours , not the least of your duties being the subjugation of Tootles and Raggles . Tootles is fifteen months old , it may interest you to know . We ca n't afford to have Tootles scream with terror every time she sees you , and it would be most unfortunate if Raggles should growl and snap at you as he does at all suspicious strangers . Once in a while he bites too . Do you like babies ? " " Yes , I -- I think I do , " he said doubtingly . " I daresay I could cultivate a taste for ' em . But , I say , " with eager enthusiasm , " I love dogs ! " " It may be distinctly in your favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that Roxy kisses Edith . " " Has he ever bitten Roxy for it ? " " No , " dubiously , " but Roxy has had to kick him on several occasions . " " How very tiresome ,  - -  to kick and kiss at the same time . " " Raggles is very jealous , you understand . " " That 's more than I can say for dear old Roxy . But I 'll try to anticipate Raggles by compelling Edith to keep her distance , " he said , scowling darkly . " Has it not occurred to you that Tootles will be pretty -- er -- much of a nuisance when it comes to mountain climbing ? " He felt his way carefully in saying this . " Oh , dear me , Roxbury , would you have left the poor little darling at home -- in all that dreadful heat ? " " I 'm sure I could n't have been blamed for leaving her at home , " he protested . " She did n't exist until half an hour ago . Heavens ! how they do spring up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting acquainted with his family -- or , rather , his menage . There were habits and foibles , demands and restrictions , that he had to adapt himself to with unvarying benignity . He made a friend of Raggles without half trying ; dogs always took to him , he admitted modestly . Tootles was less vulnerable . She howled consistently at each of his first half-dozen advances ; his courage began to wane with shocking rapidity ; his next half-hearted advances were in reality inglorious retreats . Spurred on by the sustaining Constance , he stood by his guns and at last was gratified to see faint signs of surrender . By midday he had conquered . Tootles permitted him to carry her up and down the station platform ( she was too young to realise the risk she ran ) . Edith and Constance , with the beaming nurse and O'Brien , applauded warmly when he returned from his first promenade , bearing Tootles and proudly heeled by Raggles . Fond mothers in the crowd of hurrying travellers found time to look upon him and smile as if to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost hear them saying it . Which , no doubt , accounted for the intense ruddiness of his cheeks . " Do you ever spank her ? " he demanded once of Mrs. Medcroft , after Tootles had brought tears to his eyes with a potent attack upon his nose . She caught the light of danger in his grey eyes and hastily snatched the offending Tootles from his arms . Miss Fowler kept him constantly at work with his eyeglass and his English , neither of which he was managing well enough to please her critical estimate . In fact , he laboured all day with the persistence , if not the sullenness , of a hard-driven slave . He did not have time to become tired . There was always something new to be done or learned or unlearned : his day was full to overflowing . He was a man of family ! The wife of his bosom was tranquillity itself . She was enjoying herself . When not amusing herself by watching Brock 's misfortunes , she was napping or reading or sending out for cool drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was content to shift responsibilities upon that ever convenient and useful creature -- a detached sister . Brock sent telegrams for her from cities along the way ,  - -  Ulm , Munich , Salzburg , and others ,  - -  all meant for the real Roxbury in London , but sent to a fictitious being in Great Russell Street , the same having been agreed upon by at least two of the conspirators . It mattered little that she repeated herself monotonously in regard to the state of health of herself and Tootles . Roxbury would doubtless enjoy the protracted happiness brought on by these despatches , even though they got him out of bed or missed him altogether until they reached him in a bunch the next day . He may also have been gratified to hear from Munich that Roxbury was perfectly lovely . She said , in the course of her longest despatch , that she was so glad that the baby was getting to like her father more and more as the day wore on . At one station Brock narrowly escaped missing the train . He swung himself aboard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sank , hot and exhausted , into the seat opposite his wife and her sister , the former looked up from her book , yawning ever so faintly , and asked : " Are you enjoying your honeymoon , Roxbury ? " " Immensely ! " he exclaimed , but not until he had searched for and caught Connie 's truant gaze . " Are n't we ? " he asked of Miss Fowler , his eyes dancing . She smiled encouragingly . " I think you are such a nice man to have about , " commented Mrs. Medcroft , this time yawning freely and stretching her fine young arms in the luxury of home contentment . Brock went to bed early , in Vienna that night -- tired but happy , caring not what the morrow brought forth so long as it continued to provide him with a sister-in-law and a wife who was devoted -- to another man . CHAPTER III THE DISTANT COUSINS The end of the week found Brock quite thoroughly domesticated -- to use an expression supplied by his new sister-in-law . True , he had gone through some trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of locality , but he was rapidly recovering it as the pathway became easier and less obscure . At first he was irritatingly remiss in answering to the name of Medcroft ; but , to justify the stupidity , it is only necessary to say that he had fallen into a condition which scarcely permitted him to know his own name , much less that of another . He was under the spell ! Wherefore it did not matter at all what name he went by : he would have answered as readily to one as the other . He blandly ignored telegrams and letters addressed to Roxbury Medcroft , and once he sat like a lump , with everyone staring at him , when the chairman of the architects ' convention asked if Mr. Medcroft had anything to say on the subject under discussion . He was forced , in some confusion , to attribute his heedlessness to a life-long defect in hearing . Thereafter it was his punishment to have his name and fragments of conversation hurled about in tones so stentorian that he blushed for very shame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lichtenstein Gallery , in the Gardens -- no matter where he went -- if he were to be accosted by any of the genial architects it was always in a voice that attracted attention ; he could have heard them if they had been a block away . It became a habit with him to instinctively lift his hand to his ear when one of them hove in sight , having seen him first . " That 's what I get for being a liar , " he lamented dolefully . Constance had just whispered her condolences . " Do you think they 'll consider it odd that you do n't shout at me too ? " " You might explain that you can tell what I am saying by looking at my lips , " she said . He was immensely relieved . Considerable difficulty had to be overcome at the Bristol in the matter of rooms . Without going into details , Brock resignedly took the only room left in the crowded hotel -- a six by ten cubby-hole on the top floor overlooking the air-shaft . He had to go down one flight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refused to stand in line and await his turn . Mrs. Medcroft had the choicest room in the hotel , looking down upon the beautiful Kaerntner-Ring . Constance proposed , in the goodness of her heart , to give up to Brock her own room , adjoining that of her sister , provided Edith would take her in to sleep with her . Edith was perfectly willing , but interposed the sage conclusion that gossiping menials might not appreciate a preference so unique . Mr. Roxbury Medcroft 's sky parlour adjoined the elevator shaft . The head of his bed was in close proximity to the upper mechanism of the lift , a thin wall intervening . A French architect , who had a room hard by , met Brock in the hall , hollow-eyed and haggard , on the morning after their first night . He shouted lugubrious congratulations in Brock 's ear , just as if Brock 's ear had not been harassed a whole night long by shrieking wheels and rasping cables . " Monsieur is very fortunate in being so afflicted , " he boomed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I might be deaf also . Ah , even an affliction such as yours , monsieur , has its benedictions ! " Matters drifted along smoothly , even merrily , for several days . They were all young and full of the joy of living . They laughed in secret over the mishaps and perils ; they whiffed and enjoyed the spice that filled the atmosphere in which they lived . They visited the gardens and the Hofs , the Chateau at Schoenbrunn , the Imperial stables , the gay " Venice in Vienna " ; they attended the opera and the concerts , ever in a most circumspect " trinity , " as Brock had come to classify their parties . Like a dutiful husband , he always included his wife in the expeditions . " You are not only a most exemplary wife , Mrs. Medcroft , " he declared , " but an unusually agreeable chaperon . I do n't know how Constance and I could get on without you . " But the day of severest trial was now at hand . The Rodneys were arriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Seattle " connections " had never seen the illustrious Medcroft , husband to their distant cousin , there still remained the disturbing fear that they would recognise -- or rather fail to recognise him !  - -  from chance pictures that might have come to their notice . Besides , there was always the possibility that they had seen or even met Brock in New York . He lugubriously admitted that he had met unfortunate thousands whom he had promptly forgotten but who seldom failed to remember him . It is not surprising , then , that the Medcrofts , ex parte , were in a state of perturbation ,  - -  a condition which did not relax in the least as the time drew near for the arrival of the five o'clock train from the north . Constance strove faithfully , even valiantly , to inject confidence into the souls of the prime conspirators . " You have done so beautifully up to this time , " she protested to the dolorous Brock , " why should you be afraid ? I once read of an Indian chief whose name was **28;4684;TOOLONG ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are afraid of Edith , but ca n't you be like the Indian ? He --  " " That 's all very nice , " mourned Brock , " but he could cover his confusion with war paint . Do n't forget that , my dear . Think of the difference in our disguises ! War paint in daubs versus spats and an eyeglass . Besides , he did n't have to talk West End English . And , moreover , he lived in a wigwam , and did n't have to explain a sky bedroom to strangers who happened along . " " That is a bit awkward , " she confessed thoughtfully . " But ca n't you say that you have insomnia , and ca n't sleep unless you are above the noise of the street ? " He looked at her with an expression that made a verbal reply to this suggestion altogether unnecessary . " Nurse says that Tootles has forgotten the real Roxbury , " she went on , after a moment . " See how cleverly you have played the part . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . They were driving in the Haupt Allee . " I hope I have n't got Roxbury into trouble by that interview I gave out concerning the new method of fire-proofing woodwork in office buildings and hotels . It occurred to me afterward that he is violently opposed to the system . I advocated it . He 'll have a -- I might say , a devil of a time explaining his change of front . " As a matter of fact , when Medcroft , hiding in London , saw the reproduced interview in the " Times , " together with editorial comments upon the extraordinary attitude of a supposedly conservative Englishman of recognised ability , he was tried almost beyond endurance . For the next two or three days the newspapers printed caustic contributions from fellow architects and builders , in each of which the luckless Medcroft was taken to task for advocating an impractical and fatuous New York hobby in the way of construction , something that staid old London would not even tolerate or discuss . The social chroniclings of the Medcrofts in Vienna , as despatched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent , in so far as Medcroft 's peace of mind was concerned , but nothing could have drawn attention to the fact that he was not in London at that particular time so decisively as the Vienna interview and its undefended front . Even his shrewdest enemy could not have suspected Medcroft of a patience which would permit him to sit quiet in London while the attacks were going on . He found some small solace in the reflection that he could make the end justify the means . On their return to the Bristol , Brock and Miss Fowler found the fair Edith in a pitiful state of collapse . She declared over and over again that she could not face the Rodneys ; it was more than should be expected of her ; she was sure that something would go wrong ; why , oh , why was it necessary to deceive the Rodneys ? Why should they be kept in the dark ? Why was n't Roxbury there to counsel wisely -- and more , ad infinitum , until the distracted pair were on the point of deserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not listen to reason , expostulation , or persuasion . It was then that Brock cruelly but effectively declared his intention to abdicate , as he also had a reputation to preserve . Whereupon , with a fine sense of distinction , she flared up and accused him of treachery to his best friend , Roxbury Medcroft , who was reposing the utmost confidence in his friendship and loyalty . How could she be expected to go on with the play if he , the man upon whom everything depended , was to turn tail in a critical hour like this ? " How can you have the heart to spoil everything ? " she cried indignantly . He looked at her in fresh amazement . " Roxbury would never forgive you . We have both placed the utmost confidence in you , Mr. Brock , and --  " " ' Sh ! Say ' Roxbury , dear ' ! " interposed the practical Constance . " The walls may have ears , my dears . " Then Mrs. Medcroft plaintively implored his forgiveness , and said that she was miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility , begged her pardon for his unnecessary harshness , and promised not to offend again . " The first quarrel , " cried Constance delightedly . " How nicely you 've made it up . And you 've been married less than a week ! " " Roxbury and I did n't have our first quarrel until we 'd been married a year , " said Edith reflectively . " Oh , I say , Edith , " exclaimed Brock , with a dark frown , " I 'd rather you would n't be forever extolling the good qualities of my predecessor . It 's very bad taste . Very much like the pies mother used to make . " " Silly ! " cried Medcroft 's wife , now in fine humour . " Besides , Rox is an Englishman . It would take him a year to produce a quarrel . The American husband is not so confounded slow . I wo n't live up to Roxbury in everything . " It was decided that Constance should greet the Rodneys upon their arrival ; the Medcrofts were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would attend the opera , which was then in the closing week . Brock , with splendid prodigality , had taken a box for the final performance of " Tristan and Isolde . " It is not out of place to remark that Brock loathed the Wagnerian opera ; he was of " The Mikado " cult . He took the seats with a definite purpose in mind to cast the burden of responsibility upon his wife , who would be forced to extend herself in the capacity of hostess , giving him the much-needed opportunity to secure safe footing in the dark area of uncertainty . He believed himself capable of diverting the youthful Miss Rodney and his discreet sister-in-law , but he was consumed by an unholy dread of Rodney pere ; something told him that this shrewd American business man was not the kind who would have the wool pulled over his eyes by anyone . Brock felt that the support of Constance was of greater value than that of Edith at any stage or in any emergency . Besides , he was now quite palpably in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he reflected in sober consideration of his plight . " But , " came the ironic justification , " I 'm able to confine it to the immediate family . That 's more than most husbands can say . " The Rodneys descended upon the Bristol at five o'clock , rushing down from the Nord-Bahnhof as if there was not a minute to spare . Constance pursued Katherine to her room , where they revelled in the delights of a reunion , gradually coming out of its throes as the hour for dressing approached . " We dine early , dear , " said Constance , " with supper after the opera . I must be off to dress . " " I am so eager to meet Mr. Medcroft . Is he nice ? " " He 's the dearest thing in the world , " cried the other , her cheeks aglow . " I 'm so glad , on Edith 's account . Most of these English matches turn out abominably , " commented Miss Rodney , who was twenty , very pretty , and very worldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulstervelt is with us ? " " No ! " " We came across him in Berlin , and dad asked him to join us , if he had nothing better to do , so he said he would . He was with us in Dresden and Prague and -- do n't you think he 's awfully jolly ? " " Ripping ! " said Constance with deplorable fervour . " How awfully English ! He said he 'd seen you in Paris this spring . " " Yes , " said Miss Fowler , her cheeks going red suddenly . " I told him you 'd asked me to be with you in June . " She could have cut out her tongue for saying this , but it was too late . Katherine laughed a trifle hardly after a stiff moment ; then a queer light flitted into her eyes ,  - -  the light of awakened opposition . Constance was saying to herself , " She 's in love with Freddie . I might have known it . " Back in her brain lay the memory of Freddie 's violent protestations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had threatened to throw himself into the Seine ; she remembered that quite well -- and also the fact that he did nothing of the sort , but had a very jolly time at Maxim 's and sent her flowers by way of repentance . Knowing Freddie so well , it would not have surprised her in the least to find that he had become engaged to Katherine . His heart was a very flexible organ . Illustration : Katherine " Oh , " said Katherine , " I believe he did say that you had mentioned us . " Of herself she was asking : " I wonder if she is in love with him ! " And thus it transpired that Freddie Ulstervelt -- addlepated , good-looking , inconstant Freddie , just out of college -- was transformed into a bone of contention , whether he would or no . He was of the kind who love or make love to every new girl they meet , seriously enough at the time , but easily passed over if need be . Rebuffs may have puzzled him , but they left no jagged scar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexperienced maidens by whispering intensely , " God , it 's grand ! " And he means it at the moment . Katherine Rodney was in love with him . He belonged to a fashionable New York family of wealth , and he had been a young lion at Pasadena during the winter just past . He owned automobiles and a yacht and -- an extensive wardrobe . These notable assets had much to do with the conquest of Mrs. Rodney : she looked with favour upon the transitory Mr. Ulstervelt , and believed in her heart that he had something to do with the location of the shining sun . But of this affair more anon , as the novelists say . Brock was presented to the Rodneys just before the party went in to dinner . He managed his eyeglass and his drawl bravely , and got on swimmingly with the elder Rodneys , until Constance appeared with Katherine and Freddie Ulstervelt . It was not until then that it occurred to Miss Fowler that Freddie , being from New York , was almost certain to know Brock either personally or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct approach of catastrophe . Brock had just been told that young Ulstervelt of New York was to be of the party . His blood ran cold . He had never seen the young man , but he knew his father well ; he had even dined at the mansion in Madison Avenue . There was every reason , however , to suspect that Freddie knew him by sight . Even as he was planning a mode of defence in case of recognition , the young man was presented . Brock 's drawl was something wonderful . " I -- aw -- knew your family , I 'm sure -- aw , quite sure , " he said . " You know , of course , that I lived in your -- aw -- delightful city for some years . Strange we never met , ' pon my soul . " " Oh , New York 's a pretty big place , Mr. Medcroft , " said Freddie good-naturedly . He was a slight young fellow with a fresh , inquisitive face . " It 's bigger than London in some ways . It 's bigger upwards . Say , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew in New York ! " " Haw , haw ! " laughed Brock , without grace or reason . Miss Fowler caught her breath sharply . " Fellow named Brock . Stupid sort of chap , my mother says . I --  " " Oh , dear me , Mr. Ulstervelt , " cried Edith , breaking in , " you sha n't say anything mean about Mr. Brock . He 's my husband 's best friend . " " I did n't say it , Mrs. Medcroft . It was my mother . " Brock was hiding a smile behind his hand . " She knows him better than I. To tell the truth , I 've never met him , but I 've seen him on the Fifth Avenue stages . You do look like him , though , by Jove . " " It 's extraordinary how many people think I look like dear old Brock , " said the false Roxbury . " But , on the other hand , most people think that Brock looks like me , so what 's the odds ? Haw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ripping ? Ripping what ? Good God , am I ripping anything ? " gasped Mr. Rodney , who was fussy and fat and generally futile . He seemed to grow suddenly uncomfortable , as if ripping was a habit with him . Dinner was a success . Brock shone with a refulgence that bedimmed all expectations . His wife was delighted ; in all of the four years of married life , Roxbury had never been so brilliant , so deliciously English ( to use her own expression ) . Constance tingled with pride . Of late , she had experienced unusual difficulty in diverting her gaze from the handsome impostor , and her thoughts were ever of him -- in justification of a platonic interest , of course , no more than that . To-night her eyes and thoughts were for him alone ,  - -  a circumstance which , could he have felt sure , would have made him wildly happy , instead of inordinately furious in his complete misunderstanding of her manner toward Freddie Ulstervelt , who had no compunction about making love to two girls at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never so resourceful . Brock was under the spell ; he was fascinated ; he had to look to himself carefully in order to keep his wits in the prescribed channel . His self-esteem received a severe shock at the opera . Mrs. Medcroft , with malice aforethought , insisted that Ulstervelt should take her husband 's seat . As the box held but six persons , the unfortunate Brock was compelled to shift more or less for himself . Inwardly raging , he suavely assured the party -- Freddie in particular -- that he would find a seat in the body of the house and would join them during the Entr'acte . Then he went out and sat in the foyer . It was fortunate that he hated Wagner . Before the end of the act he was joined by Mr. Rodney , horribly bored and eager for relief . In a near-by cafe they had a whiskey and soda apiece , and , feeling comfortably reinforced , returned to the opera house arm-in-arm , long and short , thin and fat , liberally discoursing upon the intellectuality of Herr Wagner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " exclaimed Mr. Rodney impulsively , even gratefully . " Eh , what ? " gasped Brock , replacing his eyeglass . " Oh , I say , now , ' pon my word , haw , haw ! " " You 've got an American sense of humour , Medcroft , that 's what you have . You recognise the joke that Wagner played on the world . Pardon me for saying it , sir , but I did n't think it was in an Englishman . " " Haw , haw ! Ripping , by Jove ! No , no ! Not you . I mean the joke . But then , you see , it 's been so long since Wagner played it that even an Englishman has had time to see the point . Besides , I 've lived a bit of my life in America . " " That accounts for it , " said the tactless but sincere Mr. Rodney . Brock glared so venomously at the intrusive Mr. Ulstervelt upon the occasion of his next visit to his own box , that Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . A few minutes later she seized the opportunity to whisper in his ear . Her eyes were sparkling , and something in her manner bespoke the bated breath . " You are in love with my sister , " was what she said to him . He blushed convincingly . " Nonsense ! " he managed to reply , but without much persuasiveness . " But you are . I 'm not blind . Anyone can see it . She sees it . Have n't you sense enough to hide it from her ? How do you expect to win ? " " My dear Mrs. -- my dear Edith , you amaze me . I 'm confusion itself . But , " he went on eagerly , illogically , " do you think I could win her ? " " That is not for one 's wife to say , " she said demurely . " I 'd be tremendously proud of you as a sister-in-law . And I 'd be much obliged if you 'd help me . But look at that confounded Ulstervelt ! He 's making love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think it might be polite if you were to ask him out for a drink , " she suggested . " But I 've had one and I never take two . " " Model husband ! Then take the girls into the foyer for a stroll and a chat after the act . Do n't mind me . I 'm your friend . " " Do you think I 've got a chance with her ? " he asked with a brave effort . " You 've had one wife thrust upon you ; why should you expect another without a struggle ? I 'm afraid you 'll have to work for Constance . " " But I have your -- I can count on your approval ? " he whispered eagerly . " Do n't , Roxbury ! People will think you are making love to me ! " she protested , wilfully ignoring his question . He returned to the box after the second act and proposed a turn in the foyer . To his disgust , Ulstervelt appropriated Constance and left him to follow with Mrs. Rodney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile she shot after him as he moved away , defeated . If he was glaring luridly at the irrepressible Freddie , he was not alone in his gloom . Katherine Rodney , green with jealousy , was sending spiteful glances after her dearest friend , while Mrs. Rodney was sniffing the air as if it was laden with frost . " Do n't you think Connie is a perfect dear ? I 'm so fond of her , " said Miss Rodney , so sweetly that he should have detected the nether-flow . He started and pulled himself together . " Aw , yes ,  - -  ripping ! " He consciously adjusted his eyeglass for a hasty glance about in search of the easily disturbed Mr. Rodney . Then , to Mrs. Rodney , his mind a blank after a passing glimpse of Constance and her escort : " Aw -- er -- a perfectly jolly opera , is n't it ? " CHAPTER IV THE WOULD-BE BROTHER-IN-LAW The next morning , bright and early , Mr. Alfred Rodney , a telegram in his hand , charged down the hall to Mrs. Medcroft 's door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . A sleepy voice asked who was there . " It 's me -- Rodney . Get up . I want to see Medcroft . Say , Roxbury , wake up ! " " Roxbury ? " came in shrill tones from within . " He -- Is n't he upstairs ? Good heaven , Mr. Rodney , what has happened ? What has happened ? " " Upstairs ? What the deuce is he doing upstairs ? " ' " He's -- he 's sleeping ! Do tell me what 's the matter ? " " Is n't this Mr. Medcroft 's room ? " " Ye-es -- but he is n't in . He objects to the noise . Oh , has anything happened to Roxbury ? " She was standing just inside the door , and her voice betrayed agitation . " My dear Edith , do n't get excited . I have a telegram from --  " She uttered a shriek . " He 's been assassinated ! Oh , Roxbury ! " " What the dev -- Are you crazy ? It 's a telegram from  - -   - -   " " Oh , heavens ! I knew they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left --  " Here she stopped suddenly . He distinctly heard her catch her breath . After a moment she went on warily : " Is it from a man named Hobart ? " " No ! It 's from Odell-Carney . Hobart ? I do n't know anybody named Hobart . " ( How was he to know that Hobart was the name that Medcroft had chosen for correspondence purposes ? ) " We 're to meet the Odell-Carneys to-day in Munich . No time to be lost . We 've got to catch the nine o'clock train . " " Oh ! " came in great relief from the other side of the door . Then , in sudden dismay : " But I ca n't do it ! The idea of getting up at an hour like this ! " " What room is Roxbury in ? " " I -- do n't KNOW ! ! " in very decided tones . " Inquire at the office ! " Alfred Rodney was a persevering man . It is barely possible that he occupied a lower social plane than that attained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not accomplishments . He always did what he set out to do . Be it said in defence of this assertion , he not only routed out his entire protesting flock , but had them at the West-Bahnhof in time to catch the Orient Express -- luggage , accessories , and all . Be it also said that he was the only one in the party , save Constance and Tootles , who took to the situation amiably . " Damn the Odell-Carneys , " was what Freddie Ulstervelt said as the train drew out of the station . Brock looked up approvingly . " That 's the first sensible thing I 've heard him say , " he muttered loud enough to be heard by Miss Fowler . " I say , who are the Odell-Carneys ? First I 've heard of ' em . " " The Odell-Carneys ? Oh , dear , have you never heard of them ? " she cried in surprise . He felt properly rebuked . " They are very swell Londoners . It is said --  " " Then , good heavens , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in alarm . " Not at all , my dear Roxbury . That 's just where you 're wrong . They do n't know Roxbury the first . I 've gone over it all with Edith . She 's just crazy to get into the Odell-Carney set . I regret to say that they have failed to notice the Medcrofts up to this time . Secretly , Edith has ambitions . She has gone to the Lord Mayor 's dinners and to the Royal Antiquarians and to Sir John Rodney 's and a lot of other functions on the outer rim , but she 's never been able to break through the crust and taste the real sweets of London society . My dear Roxbury , the Odell-Carneys entertain the nobility without compunction , and they 've been known to hobnob with royalty . Mrs. Odell-Carney was a Lady Somebody-or-other before she married the second time . She 's terribly smart , Roxbury . " " How , in the name of heaven , do they happen to be hobnobbing , as you call it , with the Rodneys , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odell-Carney is promoting a new South African mining venture . I have it from Freddie Ulstervelt that he 's trying to sell something like a million shares to Mr. Rodney , who has loads of money that came from real mines in the Far West . He 'd never be such a fool as to sink a million in South Africa , you know , but he 's just clever enough to see the advantage of keeping Odell-Carney in tow , as it were . It means a great deal to Mrs. Rodney , do n't you know , Roxbury , to be able to say that she toured with the Odell-Carneys . Freddie says that Cousin Alfred is talking in a very diplomatic manner of going on to London in August to look fully into the master . It is understood that the Rodneys are to be the guests of the Odell-Carneys while in London . It wo n't be the season , of course , so there wo n't be much of a commotion in the smart set . It is our dear Edith 's desire to slip into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you comprehend ? " They were seated side by side in the corner of the compartment , his broad back screening her as much as possible from the persistent glances of Freddie Ulstervelt , who was nobly striving to confine his attentions to Katherine . Brock 's eyes were devouring her exquisite face with a greediness that might have caused her some uneasiness if there had not been something pleasantly agreeable in his way of doing it . " Yes -- faintly , " he replied , after an almost imperceptible conflict between the senses of sight and hearing . " But how does she intend to explain me away ? I 'll be a dreadful skeleton in her closet if it comes to that . When she is obliged to produce the real Roxbury , what then ? " " She 's thought it all out , Roxbury , " said Constance severely but almost inaudibly . " I 'm sure Freddie heard part of what you said . Do be careful . She 's going to reveal the whole plot to Mrs. Odell-Carney just as soon as Roxbury gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you see . Mrs. Odell-Carney will be implored to aid in the deception for a few days , and she 'll consent , because she 's really quite a bit of a sport . At the psychological moment the Rodneys will be told . That places Mrs. Odell-Carney in the position of being an abettor or accomplice : she 's had the distinction of being a sharer in a most glorious piece of strategy . Do n't you see how charmingly it will all work in the end ? " " What are you two whispering about ? " demanded Freddie Ulstervelt noisily , patience coming to an end . " Wha -- what the devil is that to --  " began Brock furiously . Constance brought him up sharp with a warning kick on the ankle . He vowed afterward that he would carry the mark to his grave . " He 's telling me what a nice chap you are , Freddie , " said she sweetly . Brock glared out of the window . Freddie sniffed scornfully . " I 'm getting sick of this job , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculate on --  " " Now , Roxbury dear , do n't be a bear , " she pleaded so gently , her eyes so full of appeal , that he flushed with sudden shame and contrition . " Forgive me , " he said , the old light coming back into his eyes so strongly that she quivered for an instant before lowering her own . " I hate that confounded puppy , " he explained lamely , guarding his voice with a new care . " If you felt as I do , you would too . " She laughed in the old way , but she was not soon to forget that moment when panic was so imminent . " I -- I do n't see how anyone can help liking Freddie , " she said , without actually knowing why . He stared hard at the Danube below . After a long silence he said ,  --  " It 's all tommy-rot about it being blue , is n't it ? " She was also looking at the dark brown , swollen river that has been immortalised in song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow-ochre , it seems to me . " He waited a long time before venturing to express the thought that of late had been troubling him seriously . " I wonder if you truly realise the difficulty Edith will have in satisfying an incredulous world with her absolutely truthful story . She 'll have to explain , you know . There 's bound to be a sceptic or two , my dear Constance . " " But there 's Roxbury , " she protested , her face clouding nevertheless . " He will set everything right . " " The world will say he is a gullible fool , " said he gently . " And the world always laughs at , not with , a fool . Alas , my dear sister , it 's a very deep pool we 're in . " He leaned closer and allowed a quaint , half-bantering , wholly diffident smile to cross his face . " I -- I 'm afraid that you are the only being on earth who can make the story thoroughly plausible . " " I ? " she demanded quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers . She blushed furiously . " Nonsense ! " she said , and abruptly left him to take a seat beside Katherine Rodney . He found small comfort in the whisperings and titterings that came , willy-nilly , to his burning ears from the corner of the compartment . He had a disquieting impression that they were discussing him ; it was forced in upon him that being a brother-in-law is not an enviable occupation . " Wot ? " he asked , almost fiercely , after the insistent Freddie had thrice repeated a question . " I say , will you have a cigaret ? " half shouted Freddie , exasperated . " Oh ! No , thanks . The train makes such a beastly racket , do n't you know . " " They told me at the Bristol you were deaf , but -- Oh , I say , old man , I 'm sorry . Which ear is it ? " " The one next to you , " replied Brock , recovering from his confusion . " I hear perfectly well with the other one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " so I 've observed . " After a reflective silence the young man ventured the interesting conclusion , " She 's a stunning girl , all right . " Brock looked polite askance . " By Jove , I 'm glad she is n't my sister-in-law . " " I suppose I 'm expected to ask why , " frigidly . " Certainly . Because , if she was , I could n't . Do you get the point ? " He crossed his legs and looked insupportably sure of himself . They reached Munich late in the afternoon and went at once to the Hotel Vier Jahretzeiten , where they were to find the Odell-Carneys . Mr. Odell-Carney was a middle-aged Englishman of the extremely uninitiative type . He was tall and narrow and distant , far beyond what is commonly accepted as blase ; indeed , he was especially slow of speech , even for an Englishman , quite as if it were an everlasting question with him whether it was worth while to speak at all . One had the feeling when listening to Mr. Odell-Carney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so long to say anything , that , if one were but moderately bright , he could finish the sentence mentally some little time in advance of the speaker , and thus be prepared to properly appreciate that which otherwise might have puzzled him considerably . It could not be said , however , that Mr. Odell-Carney was ponderous ; he was merely the effectual result of delay . Perhaps it is safe to agree with those who knew him best ; they maintained that Odell-Carney was a pose , nothing more . His wife was quite the opposite in nearly every particular , except height and angularity . She was bony and red-faced and opinionated . A few sallow years with a rapid , profligate nobleman had brought her , in widowhood , to a fine sense of appreciation of the slow-going though tiresomely unpractical men of the Odell-Carney type . It mattered little that he made poor investment of the money she had sequestered from his lordship ; he had kept her in the foreground by associating himself with every big venture that interested the financial smart set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any money , he was looked upon as a financier of the highest order . Which is saying a great deal in these unfeeling days of pounds and shillings . Of course Mrs. Odell-Carney was dressed as all rangy , long-limbed Englishwomen are prone to dress ,  - -  after a model peculiarly not her own . She looked ridiculously ungraceful alongside the smart , chic American women , and yet not one of them but would have given her boots to be able to array herself as one of these . There was no denying the fact that Mrs. Odell-Carney was a " regular tip-topper , " as Mr. Rodney was only too eager to say . She had the air of a born leader ; that is to say , she could be gracious when occasion demanded , without being patronising . In due course of time the Medcrofts and Miss Fowler were presented to the distinguished couple . This function was necessarily delayed until Odell-Carney had time to go into the details of a particularly annoying episode of the afternoon . He was telling the story to his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he got through . It seems that Mr. Odell-Carney felt the need of a nap at three o'clock . He gave strict injunctions that there was to be no noise in the halls while he slept , and then went into his room and stretched out . Anyone who has stopped at the Hotel Four Seasons will have no difficulty in recalling the electric hall-bells which serve to attract the chambermaids to given spots . If one needs the chambermaid , he presses the button in his room and a little bell in the hall tinkles furiously until she responds and shuts it off . In that way one is sure that she has heard and is coming , a most admirable bit of German ingenuity . If she happens to be taking her lunch at the time , the bell goes on ringing until she returns ; it is a faithful bell . Coming back to Odell-Carney : the maid on his floor was making up a room in close proximity when a most annoying thing happened to her . A porter who had reason to dislike her came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the room . She could n't get out , and she had been warned against making a sound that might disturb the English guest . With rare intelligence , she did not scream or make an outcry , but wisely proceeded to press the button for a chambermaid . Then she evidently sat down to wait . To make the story short , she rang her own call-bell for two hours , no other maid condescending to notice the call , which speaks volumes for the almost martial system of the hotel . The bell was opposite the narrator 's door . Is it , therefore , surprising that he required a great deal of time to tell all that he felt ? It was not so much of what he did that he spoke at such great length , but of what he felt . " ' Pon me soul , " he exploded in the end , twisting his mustache with nervous energy , " it was the demdest nap I ever had . I did n't close my eyes , c'nfend me if I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final glare at an unoffending ' bus boy who almost dropped his tray of plates in consequence , Mr. Rodney fussily intervened and introduced the Medcrofts . Mrs. Odell-Carney was delightfully gracious ; she was sure that no nicer party could have been " got together . " Her husband may have been excessively slow in most things , but he was quick to recognise and appreciate feminine beauty of face and figure . He unbent at once in the presence of the unmistakably handsome Fowler sisters ; his expressive " chawmed " was in direct contrast to his ordinary manner of acknowledging an introduction . " Mr. Medcroft is the famous architect , you know , " explained the anxious Mrs. Rodney . " Oh , yes , I know , " drawled Mr. Odell-Carney . " You American architects are doing great things , ' pon my soul , " he added luminously . Brock stuck his eyeglass in tighter and hemmed with raucous precision . Mrs. Medcroft stiffened perceptibly . " Oh , but he 's Mr. Roxbury Medcroft , the great English architect , " cried Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glared hard at Brock ; the Rodneys saw signs of disaster . " Oh , by Jove , are you the fellow who put those new windows in the Chaucer Memorial Hall ? ' Pon me soul ! Are you the man who did that ? " There was no mistaking his manner ; he was distinctly annoyed . Brock faced the storm coolly , for his friend Medcroft 's sake . " I am Roxbury Medcroft , if that 's what you mean , Mr. Odell-Carney . " " I know you 're Medcroft , but , hang it all , wot I asked was , did you design those windows ? ' Gad , sir , they 're the laughing sensation of the age . Where the devil did you get such ideas -- eh , wot ? " His wife had calmly , diplomatically intervened . " I hate that man , " said Mrs. Medcroft to her supposed husband a few minutes later . There was a dangerous red in her cheeks , and she was breathing quickly . Brock gave an embarrassed laugh and mentioned something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party left on the following day for Innsbruck , where Mr. Rodney already had reserved the better part of a whole floor for himself and guests . Mr. Odell-Carney , before they left Munich , brought himself to the point of apologising to Brock for his peppery remarks . He was sorry and all that , and he hoped they 'd be friends ; but the windows were atrocious , there was no getting around that . His wife smoothed it over with Edith by confiding to her the lamentable truth that poor Odell-Carney had n't the remotest idea what he was talking about half of the time . After carefully looking Edith over and finding her valuably bright and attractive , she cordially expressed the hope that she would come to see her in London . " We must know each other better , my dear Mrs. Medcroft , " she had said amiably . Edith thought of the famous drawing-rooms in Mayfair and exulted vastly . " And Mr. Medcroft , too . I am so interested in men who have a craft . They always are worth while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American Mr. Medcroft is . I daresay he gets that from having lived so long with an American wife . And what a darling baby ! She 's wonderfully like Mr. Medcroft , do n't you think ? No one could mistake that child 's father -- never ! And , my dear , " leaning close with a whimsical air of confidence , " that 's more than can be said of certain children I know of in very good families . " Edith may have gasped and looked wildly about in quest of help , but her agitation went unnoticed by the new friend . From that momentous hour Mrs. Medcroft encouraged an inordinate regard for the circumspect . She decided that it was best never to be alone with her husband ; the future was now too precious to go unguarded for a single moment that might be unexplainable when the triumphal hour of revelation came to hand . She impressed this fact upon her sister , with the result that while Brock was never alone with his prudent wife , he was seldom far from the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate alibi , the fickle Tootles began to show unmistakable signs of aversion for her temporary parent . Mrs. Rodney , being an old-fashioned mother , could not reconcile herself to this unfilial attitude , and gravely confided to her husband that she feared Medcroft was mistreating his child behind their backs . " Well , the poodle likes him , anyway , " protested Mr. Rodney , who liked Brock ; " and if a dog likes a man he 's not altogether a bad lot . If I were you , I would n't spread the report . " " Spread it ! " she sniffed indignantly . " Are they not my own cousins ? Twice removed , " she concluded as an after-thought . " Do you imagine that I would spread it ? He may be an unnatural father , but I shall not be the one to say so . Please bear that in mind , Alfred . " " Well , let 's not argue about it , " said Mr. Rodney , departing before she could disobey the injunction . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to establishing the Medcrofts . For a while it looked as though Brock would have to share a room with Tootles , relegating Burton to an alcove and a couch ; but Constance , in a strictly family conclave , was seized by an inspiration which saved the day -- or the night , more properly speaking . " I have it , Roxbury , " she cried , her eyes dancing . " You can sleep on the balcony . A great many invalids do , you know . " " But , good heaven , I 'm not an invalid , " he remonstrated feebly . " Of course , you 're not , but ca n't you say you are ? It 's quite simple . You sleep in the open air because it does your lungs so much good . Oh , I know ! It is n't necessary to expand your chest like that . They 're perfectly sound , I daresay . I should think you 'd rather enjoy the fresh air . Besides , there is n't a room to be had in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he protested , knowing full well he was doomed . " You poor boy , have n't you an umbrella ? " she cried with such a perfectly entrancing laugh that he would have slept out in a hailstorm to provide recompense . And so it was settled that he was to sleep in the small balcony just off the baby 's luxurious room , the hotel people agreeing to place a cot there at night in order to oblige the unfortunate guest with the affected lung . " You are so dear and so agreeable , Roxbury , " purred Mrs. Medcroft , very much relieved . " If ever I hear of a girl looking for a nice husband , I 'll recommend you . " " It 's all very nice , " said he with a wry grin , " but I 'm hanged if I ought to be expected to remember all of my accomplishments . " They were sitting in her room , attended by the faithful duenna , Constance . " First , the eyeglass ; then the English language , with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of my ears -- I ca n't remember which until it 's too late ; and now I 'm to be a tubercular . You 've no idea how hard it is for me to speak English against Odell-Carney . I 'm an out-and-out amateur beside him . And it 's horribly annoying to have Ulstervelt shouting in my ear loud enough for everybody in the dining-room to hear . It 's rich , I tell you , and if I did n't love you so devotedly , Edith , I 'd be on my way at this very instant . There ! I feel better . ' On my way ' is the first American line I 've had in the farce since we left Stuttgart . By the way , Edith , I 'm afraid I 'll have to punch Odell-Carney 's confounded head before long . He 's getting to be so friendly to me as Roxbury Medcroft that I ca n't endure him as Brock . " " I -- I do n't understand , " murmured Edith plaintively . Constance looked up with a new interest in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's working so hard to square himself with Medcroft for the break he made about the windows , that he 's taking his spite out on all American architects . Confound him , he persists in saying I 'm all right , but God deliver him from those demmed rotters , the American builders . He says he would n't let one of us build a hencoop for him , much less a dog kennel . Oh , I say , Connie , do n't laugh ! How would you like it if --  " But both of them were laughing at him so merrily that he joined them at once . Burton and O'Brien , who had come in , were smiling discreetly . " Come , Roxbury , what do you say to a good long walk ? " cried Constance . " I must talk to you seriously about a great many things , beginning with egotism . " He set forth with alacrity , rejoicing in spite of his limitations . Upon their return from the delightful stroll along the mountain side , she went at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more deeply in love than ever before , lighted a cigar and seated himself in the gallery , dubiously retrospective in his meditations . He was sorely disturbed by her almost constant allusion to Freddie Ulstervelt and his " amazingly attractive ways . " Was it possible that she could be really in love with that insignificant little whipper-snapper ? He seemed to be propounding this doleful question to the lofty , sphinx-like Waldraster-Spitze , looming dark in the path of the south . " Hello ! " exclaimed a voice close to his ear ,  - -  the fresh , confident voice that he knew so well . " I 've been looking for you everywhere . " Freddie drew up a chair and sat down at his " good side . " The young man appeared to have something weighty on his mind . Brock shifted uneasily . " I want to put it up to you , Mr. Medcroft , as man to man . You are Connie 's brother-in-law and you ought to be able to set me straight . " " Ah , I see , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , surprise and doubt in his face . " No , I should say I do n't , do n't you see , " substituted Brock . " I was wondering how you could have seen . It 's a matter I have n't discussed with anyone . I 've come to have a liking for you , Roxbury . You 're my sort ; you have a sort of New York feeling about you . I 'm sure you 're enough of a sport to give me unprejudiced advice . Hands across the sea , see ? Well , to get right down to the point , old man , you 'll pardon my plain speech ,  - -  I think Constance ought to marry an American . " Brock sat up very straight . " I think that's -- that 's a matter for Miss Fowler to determine , " he said coldly . " You do n't quite get my meaning , " persisted Freddie , crossing his legs comfortably . " I was trying to make it easy for myself . " " You mean , you think she ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely . How clever you are . " " But you are said to be engaged to Miss Rodney , " ventured Brock , feeling his way . " That 's just the point , Mr. Medcroft . We 're not really engaged -- but almost . As a matter of fact , we 've got to the point where it 's really up to me to speak to her father about it , do n't you know . Luckily , I have n't . " " Luckily ? " " Yes . That would have committed me , do n't you see . I 've been tentatively engaged more than a dozen times , but never quite up to the girl 's father . Now , I do n't mind telling you that I 've changed my mind about Katherine . She 's a jolly good sort , but she 's not just my sort . I thought she was , but -- well , you know how it is yourself . The heart 's a damned queer organ . Mine has gone back to Constance in the last two days . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through and through . I want your help . I 've got money to burn , and the family 's got position in the States . I can take care of her as she should be taken care of . No little old six-room flat for her . But , of course , you understand , I ca n't quite carry the thing through with Katherine still feeling herself attached , as it were . The thing to decide is this : how best can I let Katherine down easily and take on Connie without putting myself in a rather hazardous position ? I 'm a gentleman , you see , and I ca n't do anything downright rotten . It would n't do . I 'm sure , in her heart , Connie cares for me . I could make her understand me better if I had half the chance . But a fellow ca n't get near her nowadays . Do n't you think you are carrying the family link too far ? Now , what I want to ask of you , as a friend , is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every chance you get ? I 'll square myself with Katherine all right . Of course , you 'll understand , I do n't want to actually break with Katherine until I 'm reasonably sure of Constance . I 'm a guest of the Rodney family , you see . It would be downright indecent of me . No , sir ! I 'm not that sort . I should n't think of ending it all with Katherine so long as we are both guests of her father . I 'd wait until the end of next week . " Brock had listened in utter amazement to the opening portion of this ingenuous proposal . As the flexile youth progressed , amazement gave place to indignation and then to disgust . Brock 's brow grew dark ; the impulse to pull his countryman 's nose was hard to overcome . Never in all his life had he listened to such a frankly cold-blooded argument as that put forth by the insufferable Knicker-bocker . In the end the big New Yorker saw only the laughable side of the little New Yorker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from whom no girl could expect much in the way of recompense . It mattered little who the girl of the moment might be , she could not hope to or even seek to hold his perambulatory affections . " He 's a single example of a great New York class , " reflected Brock . " The futile , priggish rich ! There are thousands like him in my dear New York -- conscienceless , invertebrate , sybaritic sons of idleness , college-bred and under-bred little beasts who can buy and then cast off at their pleasure . They have no means of knowing how to fall in love with a good girl . They have not been trained to it . It is not for their scrambled intellects to discriminate between the chorus-girl brand of attack and the subtle wooing of a gentlewoman . They ca n't analyse -- they ca n't feel ! And this insipid , egotistical little bounder is actually sitting there and asking me to help him with the girl I love ! Good Lord , what next ? " He surveyed the eager Ulstervelt in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The very thought of him as Connie 's accepted lover ! She , the adorable , the splendid , the unapproachable ! It was excruciatingly funny ! " Oh , I say , old man , " cried Freddie , when the disconcerting laugh came , " do n't laugh ! It 's no damned joke . " " ' Pon my soul , Ulstervelt , " apologised Brock , with a magnanimous smile , " I have n't said it was a joke . You --  " " Then , what are you laughing at ? Something you heard yesterday ? " with fine scorn . Brock stared hard at the flushed , boyish face of the other ; it was weak and yet as hard as brass , hard with the overbearing confidence of the spoiled child of wealth . " See here , Ulstervelt , " he said with sudden coldness , " you 're asking my help . That 's no way to get it . " " I beg pardon ! I do n't mean to be rude , " apologised Freddie . " But , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your while . My father 's got stacks of coin , and he 's a power in New York . Odell-Carney 's right . American architects ca n't design good hencoops . What we want in New York is a rattling good , up-to-date Englishman or two to show ' em a few things . They 're a lot of muckers over there , take it from me . By Jove , Roxbury , you do n't know how I 'd appreciate your friendship in this matter . It will simplify things immensely . You 'll speak a good word for me when the time comes , now , wo n't you ? " " You want me to do you a good turn , " said Brock slowly . He found himself grinning with a malicious joy . " All right , I 'll see to it that Miss Rodney does n't marry you , my boy . I 'll attend to her . " " Just a minute , " interrupted Freddie quickly . " Do n't be too hasty about that . I want to be sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about to add that I 'll give Constance a strong hint that one of the most gallant young sparks in New York is likely to propose to her before the end of the week . That will --  " " Heavens ! " exclaimed Freddie , in disgust . " You need n't do that . I 've already proposed to her five or six times . " " And she -- she is undecided ? " cried Brock , his eyes darkening . " No , hang it all , she 's not undecided . She 's said no every time . That 's why I 'm up a tree , so to speak . " " Oh ? " was all that Brock said . Of course she could n't love a creature of Freddie 's stamp ! He gloated ! " ' Gad , you 're a lucky dog , Roxbury , " went on Freddie enviously . " Money is n't everything . You 're married to one of the prettiest and most fascinating women in the world . She 's a wonder . You ca n't blame me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you ? And that kid ! You lucky dog ! " CHAPTER V THE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY Brock discovered in due time that he was living in a lofty but uncertain place , among the clouds of exaltation . It was not until the close of the succeeding day that he began to lower himself grudgingly from the height to which Freddie 's ill-mannered confession had led him . By that time he satisfactorily had convinced himself that no one but a fool could have suspected Constance of being in love with Ulstervelt ; and yet , on the other hand , was he any better off for this cheerful argument ? There was nothing to prove that she cared for him , notwithstanding this agreeable conclusion by contrast . As a matter of fact , he came earthward with a rush , weighted down by the conviction that she did not care a rap for him except as a conveniently moral brother-in-law . He was further distressed by Edith 's comfortless , though perhaps well-qualified , announcement that she believed her sister to be in love ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " acted as if she were . " " Besides , Roxbury , " she said warningly , " it 's a most degenerate husband who falls in love with his wife 's sister . " They were walking in one of the mountain paths , some distance behind the others . They did not know that Mrs. Odell-Carney had stopped to rest in the leafy niche above the path . She was lazily fanning herself on the stone seat that man had provided as an improvement to nature . Being a sharp-eared person with a London drawing-room instinct , she plainly could hear what they were saying as they approached . These were the first words she fully grasped , and they caused her to prick up her ears : " I do n't give a hang , Edith . I 'm tired of being her brother-in-law . " " You 're tired of me , Roxbury , that 's what it is , " in plaintive tones . " You 're happy , you love and are loved , so please do n't put it that way . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in . " " My dear Roxbury , " quite severely , " if there 's nothing else that will influence you , just stop to consider the che-ild ! There 's Tootles , dear Tootles , to think of . " Of course Mrs. Odell-Carney could not be expected to know that Edith was blithely jesting . " My dear Edith , " he said , just as firmly " Tootles has nothing to do with the case . You know , and Constance knows , and I know , and the whole world will soon know that I 'm not even related to her , poor little beggar . I do n't see why she should come between me and happiness just because she happens to bear a social resemblance to a man who is n't her father . Come , now , let 's talk over the situation sensibly . " Just then they passed beyond the hearing of the astonished eavesdropper . Good heaven , what was this ? Not his child ? Two minutes later Mrs. Odell-Carney was back at the spring where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hill because all of his breath was required to smoke a cigaret . " Carney , " she said sternly , her lips rigid , her eyes set hard upon his face , " how long have the Medcrofts been married ? " He blinked heavily . " How the devil should I know ? ' Pon me word , it's --  " " Four years , I think Mrs. Rodney told me . How old is that baby ? " " ' Pon me soul , Agatha , I 'm as much in the dark as you . I do n't know . " " A little over a year , I 'd say . Well , I just heard Medcroft say that she was n't his child . Whose is it ? " She stood there like an accusing angel . He started violently , and his jaw dropped ; an expression of alarmed protest leaped into his listless eyes . " ' Pon me word , Agatha , how the devil should I know ? Do n't look at me like that . Give you my word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pon me soul , I do n't , my dear . " He was very much in earnest , thoroughly aroused by what seemed to be a direct insinuation . " Oh , do n't be stupid , " she cried . " Good heavens , can there be a scandal in that lovely woman 's life ? " " There 's never any scandal in a woman 's life unless she 's reasonably lovely , " remarked he . " Whose child is she , if she is n't Medcroft 's ? " she pursued with a perplexed frown . " Demme , Agatha , do n't ask me , " he said irritably , passing his hand over his brow . " I 've told you that twice . Ask them ; I daresay they know . " She looked at him in disgust . " As if I could do such a thing as that ! Dear me , I do n't understand it at all . Four years married . Yes , I 'm sure that 's it . Carney , you do n't suppose --  " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . " Agatha , " said he , weighing his remark carefully , " I 've said all along that Medcroft is a fool . Take those windows , for instance . If he --  " " Oh , rubbish ! What have the windows to do with it ? You are positively stupid . And I 'd come to like her too . Yes , I 'd even asked her to come and see me . " She was really distressed . " And why not ? " he demanded . " Hang it all , Agatha , it 's nothing unusual . She 's a jolly good sort and a sight too good for Medcroft . He 's a stupid ass . I 've said so all along . How the devil she ever married him , I ca n't see . But , by Jove , Agatha , I can readily see how she might have loved the father of this child , no matter who he is . Take my advice , my dear , and do n't be harsh in your judgment . Do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reconciled to the -- er -- the situation , why the devil should we give a hang ? And , above all , do n't let these Rodneys suspect . " Here he lowered his voice gradually . " They 're a pack of rotters and they could n't understand . They 'd cut her , even if she is a cousin or whatever it is . I 've give a year or two of my life to know positively whether Rodney intends taking those shares or not . " He said it in contemplative delight in what he would do if it were definitely settled . " I ca n't stand them much longer . " " What great variety of Americans there are , " she reflected . " Mrs. Medcroft and her sister are Americans . Compare them with the Rodneys and Mr. Ulstervelt . No , Carney , I 'll not start a scandal . The Rodneys would not understand , as you say . They 'd tear her to shreds and gloat over the mutilation . No ; we 'll have her to see us in London . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agatha , I like her sister . " " My dear , the baby is a darling . " " But what an ass Medcroft is ! " And thus is it proved that Mrs. Odell-Carney was not only a dutiful wife in taking her husband into her confidence , but also that jointly they enjoyed a peculiarly rational outlook upon the world as they had come to know it and to feel for the people thereof . It is of small consequence that they could not find it in their power to be in tune with the virtuous Rodneys : the Rodneys were conditions , not effects . However that may be , it was Katherine Rodney , pretty , plump , and spoiled , who pulled the first stone from the foundation of Medcroft 's house of cards . Katherine had convinced herself that she was deeply enamoured of the volatile Freddie ; the more she thought that she loved him , the greater became the conviction that he did not care as much for her as he professed . She began to detect a decided falling off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact from herself that Constance was the most disturbing symptom in evidence . Jealousy succeeded speculation . Katherine decided to be hateful ; she could not have helped it if she had tried . It was very evident , to her at least , that Freddie was not to blame ; he was being led on by the artful Miss Fowler . There could be no doubt of it -- none in the least , declared Miss Rodney in the privacy of her own miserable reflections . Just as she was on the point of carrying her woes to her mother , an astounding revelation came to her out of a clear sky ; an entirely new condition came into the problem . It dawned upon her suddenly , without warning , that Roxbury Medcroft was in love with his sister-in-law ! Illustration : " She began to detect a decided falling off in his ardour . " When she burst in upon her mother , half an hour later , that excellent lady started up from her couch , alarmed by the excitement in her daughter 's face . Mrs. Rodney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always think the world is coming to an end , or the house is on fire , or the king has been assassinated , if any one approaches with a look of distress in his face . " My dear , my dear ! " she cried , as Katherine stopped tragically in the doorway . " What has happened to your father ? Speak ! " " Mamma , it 's worse than that ! I --  " " Merciful heaven ! " The good lady blindly reached for her smelling salts . " I 've made a dreadful discovery , " went on Katherine in suppressed tones . " It came to me like a flash . I could n't believe my own brain . So I watched them from my window . There 's no doubt about it , mamma . It 's as plain as the nose on your face . He --  " " My darling , what are you talking about ? Is my nose -- what is the matter with my nose ? " She vaguely felt of her nose in horror . " He 's in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you believe me , mamma , she is encouraging him ! Positively ! Why -- why , it 's utterly contemptible ! Oh , dear , what are we to do ? " Mrs. Rodney looked blankly at her daughter , who had thrown herself in a chair . She gasped and then gave vent to a tremulous squeak . " In love ! Your father ? With whom -- who is she ? " " Father ? Oh , Lord , mother , I did n't say anything about father . Do n't cry ! It 's another man altogether . " " Not Freddie Ulstervelt ? " quavered Mrs. Rodney , pulling herself together . " After all he has said to you --  " " No , no , mamma , " cried her daughter irritably . " Freddie may be in love with her , but he 's not the only one . Mamma ! " She straightened up and looked at her mother with wide , horror-struck eyes , " Roxbury Medcroft is madly in love with Constance Fowler ! " Mrs. Rodney did not utter a sound for fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes from her daughter 's distressed face . The colour was coming back into her own , and her lips were setting themselves into thin red lines above her rigid chin . " I 'm sorry , Katherine , that you have seen it too . I have suspected it for several days . But I have not dared to speak -- it seemed too improbable . What are we to do ? " She sat down suddenly , even weakly . " She 's not only leading Freddie on , but she 's flirting with her own brother-in-law -- her own sister 's husband -- her -- her --  " " Her own niece 's father ! It 's atrocious ! " " She 's a horrid beast ! And I thought I loved her . Oh , mamma , it 's just dreadful ! " " Katherine , control yourself . I will not have you upsetting yourself like this . You 'll have another of those awful headaches . Leave it all to me , dear . Something must be done . We ca n't stand by and see dear Edith betrayed . She 's so happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd be dragged into the scandal . I --  " " And the Odell-Carneys too . Heavens ! " " It must be stopped ! I shall go at once to Mrs. Odell-Carney and tell her what we have discovered . It will prepare her . She is the best friend I have , and I know she will suggest a way to put a stop to this thing before it is too late . We must --  " " Why do n't you speak to father about it first ? " " Your father ! My dear , what would be the use ? He would n't believe it . He never does . I wonder if dear Mrs. Odell-Carney is in her room . " The estimable lady fluttered loosely toward the door . Her daughter called to her . " If I were you , I 'd wait a day or two , mamma . " She was quite cool and very calculating now . " It may adjust itself , and -- and if we can just drop a hint that we suspect , they wo n't be so -- so -- well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddie will be disgusted with her if he sees how she 's carrying on . " Katherine suddenly had realised that good might spring from evil , after all . In the mean time , young Mr. Ulstervelt was having troubles and disappointments of his own . Persistent effort to make love to Miss Fowler had finally resulted in an almost peremptory command to desist . An unlucky impulse to hold her hand during one of his attempts to " try her out " met with disaster . Miss Fowler snatched her hand away and , with a look he never forgot , abruptly left him . " It 's all off with her , " ruminated Freddie , shivering slightly as an after effect of the icy stare she had given him . " She 's got it in for me , for some reason or other . Wow ! That was a frost ! I feel it yet . Medcroft has played the deuce helping me . I wonder if --  Hello ! There 's Katherine . " Freddie did some rapid-fire thinking in the next half-minute , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Katherine Rodney restored to her own . So long as he could not possibly win Constance he figured that he might just as well devote himself to the girl he was virtually engaged to marry . Freddie 's was a convenient and adaptable constancy . Miss Fowler out of sight was also out of mind ; he descended upon Katherine with all of the old ardour shining in his eyes . It was soon after Miss Rodney 's conference with her mother , and the young lady was off for a walk in the town . " Hello , Katherine , " called he , coming up from behind . " Shopping ? Take me along to carry the bundles . I want to begin now . " It was Miss Rodney 's fancy to receive his advances with disdain . She assumed a most unfriendly manner . " Indeed ? " with chilling irony . " And why , may I ask ? " Freddie was taken aback . This was most unexpected . " Practice makes perfect , " he said glibly . " Do n't you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it almost tearfully . Katherine exulted inwardly . Outwardly she was very cool and very baffling . " Please do n't call me Kitty . I hate it . " " It 's a dear little name . That 's what I 'm going to call you when we are -- well , you know . " " I do n't know . What are you talking about ? " " Oh , come now , Miss Rodney . Do n't be so icy . What 's up ? Never mind -- do n't tell me . I know . You 're jealous of Connie . " It was a bold stroke and it had an immediate effect . " Jealous ! " she scoffed , but her cheeks went red . " Not I , Freddie . " She considered for a second and then went on : " She 's not in love with you . You must be blind . She 's crazy about Mr. Medcroft . " " By Jove , " exclaimed Freddie , stopping short , his eyes bulging . He looked at her for a minute in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're right ! She is in love with him . I see it now . Well , what do you think of that ! Her brother-in-law ! " " And he is in love with her too . Now you may go back to her and see if you ca n't win her away from him . I sha n't interfere , my dear Freddie . Do n't have me on your conscience . Good-by . " She left him standing there in the street . With well-practised tact he darted into a tobacconist 's shop . " Another shake-down , " he reflected ruefully . " They 're all passing me up to-day . But , great hooks , what 's all this about Medcroft and Constance ? " He bought some cigarets and started off for a walk , mildly excited by this new turn of affairs . It occurred to him , as he turned it all over in his mind , that Mrs. Medcroft was amazingly resigned to the situation . Of course , she was not blind to her husband 's infatuation for her sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , it followed that she was not especially distressed ; in fact , it suddenly dawned upon him she was not only reconciled but relieved . She had ceased to love her husband ! She could be a freelance in Love 's lists , notwithstanding the inconvenience of a legal attachment . " She 's ripping , too , " concluded Freddie , with a certain buoyancy of spirit . " If she does n't love Medcroft , she at least ought to love someone else instead . It 's customary . I wonder --  " Here he reflected deeply for an instant , his spirits floating high . Then he turned abruptly and made his way to the Tirol . It came to pass , in the course of the evening , that Mr. Ulstervelt , supremely confident from the effect of past achievements , drew the unsuspecting Mrs. Medcroft into a secluded tete-a-tete . It is not of record that he was ever a diplomatic wooer ; one in haste never is . Suffice it to say , Mrs. Medcroft , her cheeks flaming , her eyes wide with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joined the party at the other end of the entresol , but not before she had said to him with unmistakable clearness and decision ,  --  " You little wretch ! How dare you say such silly things to me ! " The rebuff decisive ! And he had only meant to be comforting , not to say self-sacrificing . He 'd be hanged if he could understand women nowadays . Not these women , at least . In high dudgeon he stalked from the room . In the door he met Brock . " For two cents , " he declared savagely , as if Brock were to blame , " I 'd take the next train for Paris . " Brock watched him down the hall . He drew a handful of small coins from his pocket , ruefully looking them over . " Two cents , " he said . " Hang it all , I 've nothing here but pfennigs and hellers and centimes . " In the course of his wanderings the disconsolate Freddie came upon Mrs. Odell-Carney and pudgy Mr. Rodney . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodney had had a hard day . He had climbed a mountain -- or , more accurately speaking , he had climbed half-way up and then the same half down . He was very tired . Freddie observed from his lonely station that Mr. Rodney was fast dropping to sleep , notwithstanding his companion 's rapid flow of small talk . It did not take Freddie long to decide . He was an outcast and a pariah and he was very lonely . He must have someone to talk to . Without more ado he bore down upon the couple , and a moment later was tactfully advising the sleepy Mr. Rodney to take himself off to bed ,  - -  advice which that gentleman gladly accepted . And so it came about that Freddie sat face to face with the last resort , at the foot of the chaise-longue , gazing with serene adulation into the eyes of a woman who might have had a son as old as he -- if she had had one at all . She had been a coquette in her salad days ; there was no doubt of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and in all stations of life . But it remained for the gallant Freddie Ulstervelt to bowl her over with surprise for the first time in her long and varied career . At the end of half an hour she pulled herself together and tapped him on the shoulder with her fan , a quizzical smile on her lips . " My dear Mr. Ulstervelt , are you trying to make love to me ? You nice Americans ! How gallant you can be . I am quite old enough to be your mother . Believe me , I thank you for the compliment . I ca n't tell you how I appreciate this delicate flattery . You are very delicious . But , " as she arose graciously , " I 'd follow Mr. Rodney 's example if I were you . I 'd go to bed . " Then , with a rare smile which could not have been more chilling , she left him standing there . " By Jove , " he muttered , passing his hand across his eyes , as if bewildered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it got to be a habit with me ? Was I making love to -- her ? " He departed for the American bar . Mrs. Rodney had but little sleep that night . She went to bed in a state of worry and uncertainty , oppressed by the shadows which threatened eternal darkness to the fair name of the family -- however distantly removed . Katherine 's secret had in reality been news to her ; she had not paid enough attention to the Medcrofts to notice anything that they did , so long as they did not do it in conjunction with the Odell-Carneys . The Odell-Carneys were her horizon ,  - -  morning , noon , and night . And now there was likelihood of that glorious horizon being obscured by a sickening scandal in the vulgar foreground . Inspired by Katherine 's dreadful conclusions , the excellent lady set about to observe for herself . During the entire evening she flitted about the hotel and grounds with all the snooping instincts of a Sherlock Holmes . She lurked , if that is not putting it too theatrically . From unexpected nooks she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she led her doubts to the gates of absolute certainty , and then sat down to shudder to her heart 's content . It was all true ! For four hours she had been trying to get to the spot where she could see with her own eyes , and at last she had come to it . Of course , she had to admit to herself that she did not actually hear Mr. Medcroft tell Constance that he loved her , but it was enough for her that he sat with her in the semi-darkness for two unbroken hours , speaking in tones so low that they might just as well have been whispering so far as her taut ears were concerned . Moreover , other persons than herself had smilingly nudged each other and referred to the couple as lovers ; no one seemed to doubt it -- nor to resent it , which is proof that the world loves a lover when it recognises him as one . Mrs. Rodney also discovered that Mrs. Medcroft went to her room at nine o'clock , at least three hours before the subdued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crying her eyes out , decided Mrs. Rodney . And now , after all this , is it to be considered surprising that the distressed mother of Katherine did not sleep well that night ? Nor should her wakefulness be laid at the door of the tired Mr. Rodney , who was ever a firm and stentorian sleeper . Morning came , and with it a horseback ride for Brock and Miss Fowler . That was enough for Mrs. Rodney ; she would hold in no longer . Mrs. Odell-Carney must be told ; she , at least , must have the chance to escape before the storm of scandal broke to muddy her immaculate skirts . Forthwith the considerate hostess appeared before her guest with a headful of disclosures . She had decided in advance that it would not do to beat about the bush , so to speak ; she would come directly to the obnoxious point . They were in Mrs. Odell-Carney 's sitting-room . Mr. Odell-Carney was smoking a cigaret on the balcony , just outside the window . Mrs. Rodney did not know that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself inhospitably aloof : Mrs. Rodney bored him to death . He did not hear all that was poured out between them , but he heard quite enough to cause him something of a pang . He distinctly heard his wife say things to Mrs. Rodney that she had solemnly avowed she would not say , things about the Medcroft baby . It goes without saying that Mrs. Odell-Carney refused to be surprised by the disclosures . She calmly admitted that she had suspected Medcroft of being too fond of his sister-in-law , but , she went on cheerfully , why not ? His wife did n't care a rap for him -- she said rap and nothing else ; Mrs. Medcroft had an affair of her own , dear child ; she was not so slow as Mrs. Rodney thought , oh , no . Mrs. Odell-Carney warmed up considerably in defending the not-to-be-pitied Edith . She said she had liked her from the beginning , and more than ever , now that she had really come to the conclusion that her husband was the kind who sets his wife an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screeched with horror when she heard that Tootles was " a poor little beggar , " and " all that sort of thing , you know . " " My dear , " said Mrs. Odell-Carney , hating herself all the time for engaging in the spread of gossip , but femininely unable to withstand the test , " your excellent cousin , Mrs. Medcroft , receives two letters a day from London ,  - -  great , fat letters which take fifteen minutes to read in spite of the fact that they are written in a perfectly huge hand by a man -- a man , d'ye hear ? They 're not from her husband . He 's here . He can not have written them in London , do n't you see ? He --  " " I see , " inserted Mrs. Rodney , who was afraid that Mrs. Odell-Carney might think she did n't see . " Mind your Mrs. Rodney , I 'm terribly cut up about all this . She has --  " " Oh , I knew you would be , " mourned Mrs. Rodney , her heart in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to --  " " Rubbish ! " scoffed the other . " It is n't that . I 've been through a dozen affairs in which my best friends were **28;4714;TOOLONG . I meant to say that I 'm terribly cut up over poor Mrs. Medcroft . She 's a dear . Believe me , she 's a most delicious sinner . Even Carney says that , and he 's very fastidious -- and very loyal . " " They are married in name only , " said Mrs. Rodney , beginning to sniffle . She looked up and smiled wanly through her tears . " You know what I mean . My grammar is terrible when I 'm nervous . " She pulled at her handkerchief for a wavering moment . " Do you think I 'd better speak to Edith ? We may be able to prevent the divorce . " " Divorce , my dear , " gasped Mrs. Odell-Carney incredulously . At this juncture Mr. Odell-Carney emerged from his shell , so to speak . He stalked through the window and confronted the two ladies , one of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance . " Now , see here , " he began without preliminary apology , " I wo n't hear of a divorce . That 's all rubbish -- perfect rot , ' pon my soul . Wot 's the use ? Hang it all , Mrs. Rodney , wot 's the odds , so long as all parties are contented ? We can stand it , by Jove , if they can , do n't you know . We ca n't regulate the love affairs of the universe . Besides , I 'm not going to stand by and see a friend dragged into a thing of this sort --  " " A friend , Carney , " exclaimed his wife . " Well , it 's possible , my dear , that he may be a friend . I know so many chaps in London who might be doing this sort of thing , do n't you know . Who knows but the chap who 's writing her these letters may be one of my best friends ? It does n't pay to take a chance on it . I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows and Miss Fowler knows , why the deuce should we bother our heads about it ? Last night I heard the Medcroft infant bawling its lungs out -- teething , I daresay -- but did I go in and take a hand in straightening out the poor little beggar ? Not I. By the same token , why should I or anybody else presume to step in and try to straighten out the troubles of its parents ? It 's useless interference , either way you take it . " " I think it 's all very entertaining and diverting , " said Mrs. Odell-Carney carelessly . She yawned . " Do you really think so ? " asked the doubting Mrs. Rodney . " I was so afraid you 'd mind . Your position in society , my dear Mrs. --  " " My position in society , Mrs. Rodney , can weather the tempest you predict , " said Mrs. Odell-Carney with a smile that went to Mrs. Rodney 's marrow . " Oh , if -- if you really do n't mind --  " she mumbled apologetically . " Not at all , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's quite immaterial , I assure you . " CHAPTER VI OTHER RELATIONS It is but natural to presume , after the foregoing , that the affairs of the Medcrofts were under close and careful scrutiny from that confidential hour . The Odell-Carneys were conspicuously nice and agreeable to the Medcrofts and Miss Fowler . It may be said , indeed , that Mr. Odell-Carney went considerably out of his way to be agreeable to Mrs. Medcroft ; so much so , in fact , that she made it a point to have someone else with her whenever she seemed likely to be left alone with him . The Rodneys struggled bravely and no doubt conscientiously to emulate the example set by the Odell-Carneys , but it was hardly to be expected that they could see new things through old-world eyes . They grew very stiff and ceremonious ,  - -  that is , the Rodney ladies did . It was their prerogative , of course : were they not cousins of the diseased ? Four or five days of uneasy pretence passed with a swiftness that irritated certain members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Days never were so short as those which the now recklessly infatuated Brock was spending . He was valiantly earning his way into the heart of Constance ,  - -  a process that tried his patience exceedingly , for she was blithely unimpressionable , if one were to judge by the calmness with which she fended off the inevitable though tardy assault . She kept him at arm 's length ; appearances demanded a discreetness , no matter how she may secretly have felt toward the good-looking husband of her sister . To say that she was enjoying herself would be putting it much too tamely ; she was revelling in the fun of the thing . It mattered little to her that people -- her own cousins in particular -- were looking upon her with cold and critical eyes ; she knew , down in her heart , that she could throw a bomb among them at any time by the mere utterance of a single word . It mattered as little that Edith was beginning to chafe miserably under the strain of waiting and deception ; the novelty had worn off for the wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was pining for the day to come when she could laugh again with real instead of simulated joyousness . " Connie , dear , " she would lament a dozen times a day , " it 's growing unbearable . Oh , how I wish the three weeks were ended . Then I could have my Roxbury , and you could have my other Roxbury , and everybody would n't be pitying me and cavilling at you because I 'm unhappily married . " " Why do you say I could have your other Roxbury ? " demanded her sister on one occasion . " You forget that father expects me to marry the viscount . I --  " " You are so tiresome , Connie . Do n't worry me with your love affairs -- I do n't want to hear them . There 's Mr. Brock waiting for you in the garden . " " I know it , my dear . He 's been waiting for an hour . I think it is good for him to wait , " said the other , with airy confidence . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He says it will all be over in a day or two . Dear me , how I wish it were over now ! I ca n't endure Cousin Mary 's snippishness much longer , and as for Katherine ! My dear , I hate that girl ! " " She 's been very nice lately , Edith -- ever since Freddie dropped me so completely . By the way , Burton was telling me to-day that Odell-Carney had been asking her some very curious and staggering questions about Tootles and your most private affairs . " " I know , my dear , " groaned Edith . " He very politely remarked to me last night that Tootles made him think very strangely of a friend of his in London . He would n't mention the fellow 's name . He only smiled and said , ' Nevah mind , my dear , he 's a c'nfended handsome dog . ' I daresay he meant that as a compliment for Tootles . She is pretty , do n't you think so , dear ? " " She 's just like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite clearly . " Then , in heaven 's name , Connie , why are they staring at her so impolitely -- all of them ? " " It 's because she is so pretty . Goodness , Edith , do n't let every little thing worry you . You 'll have wrinkles and grey hairs soon enough . " " It 's all very nice for you to talk , " grumbled Edith . " I 'm going mad with loneliness . You have a lover near you all the time -- he 's mad about you . What have I ? I 'm utterly alone . No one loves me -- no , not a soul --  " " You wo n't let them love you , Edith , " said Constance jauntily . " They all want to love you -- all of them . " " I hate men , " announced Mrs. Medcroft , retrospectively . Developments of a most refractory character swooped down upon them at the very end of the sojourn in Innsbruck . Every one had begun to rejoice in the fact that the fortnight was almost over , and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry away with them . The Rodneys were going to Paris , the Medcrofts to London , the Odell-Carneys ( after finding out where the others were bent ) to Ostend . Freddie Ulstervelt suddenly announced his determination to remain at the Tirol for a week or two longer . That very day he had been introduced to a Mademoiselle Le Brun , a fascinating young Parisian , stopping at the Tirol with her mother . All might have ended well had it not been for the unfortunate circumstance of Odell-Carney 's making a purchase of the London Standard instead of the Times , as was his custom . His lamentations over this piece of stupidity were cut short by the discovery of an astonishing article upon the editorial page of the paper -- an article which created within him a sense of grave perplexity . He read the headlines thrice and glanced through the text twice , neither time with any very definite idea of what he was reading . His fingers shook as he held the sheet nearer the window for a final effort to untangle the incredible thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' Pon me word , " he kept repeating to himself feebly . Then he got up and went off in extreme haste to find his wife . " My dear , " he said to her in the carriage-way , " I must speak with you alone . " She was just starting off for a drive with Mrs. Rodney . " Bad news , Carney ? " she demanded , struck by his expression . She was following him toward a remote corner of the approach . He did not reply until they were seated , much nearer to each other than was their wont . " Read that , " he said , slipping the Standard into her hands . " Wot do you think of it ? " " My dear Carney , I do n't know . Would you mind telling me what I am to read ? " " The Medcroft thing . Right there . " She read the article , her husband watching her face the while . Surprise , incredulity , dismay , succeeded each other in rapid changes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roxbury Medcroft in connection with the County Council 's sub-committee -- in London ! The story went on to relate how Medcroft , implacable leader of the opposition to the " grafters , " suddenly had appeared before the committee with the most astounding figures and facts to support his charges of rottenness on the part of the " clique " ; his unexpected descent upon the scene had thrown the opposing leaders into a panic ; every one had been led to believe that he was sojourning in the east . As a matter of fact , it was soon revealed , he had been in London , secretly working on the problem , for nearly three weeks , keeping discreetly under cover in order that his influence might not be thwarted . His array of facts , his bitter arraignment of the men who were trying to force the building bill through the Council , staggered the whole city of London . At that writing it looked as though the bill would be overthrown , its promoters had been so completely put to rout . The committee would be compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full threshing out of the obnoxious deal . Roxbury Medcroft 's name was on every one 's lips . The Standard had profited by securing a great " beat . " The Odell-Carneys looked at each other in wonder and perplexity . " What does it mean ? " asked the lady , her eyes narrowing . " Look here , Agatha , this paper 's at least two days old . Now , how the devil can Medcroft be in London and Innsbruck at the same time . He was here day before yesterday , was n't he ? I 'm so c'nfended unobserving --  " " Yes , yes , he was here . And this paper --  " She paused irresolutely . " Says he was there . ' Pon my word , it 's most uncanny . There 's some mystery here . " " I 've got it , Carney ! This is not Roxbury Medcroft . " " Good Gawd ! " " This explains everything . Heavens , Carney ! This fellow is -- is her lover ! She 's running about the country with him . She's --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he may have been so at one time , but he 's the other one 's lover now , take my word for it . I say , ' pon my soul , this is a charming game your friends the Rodneys have let us into . They --  " " My friends ! Yours , you mean ! " she retorted . " Oh , come now ! But let it go at that . They know , of course , that this fellow is n't her husband , and yet , by Gad , Agatha , they 've gone about deliberately palming him off on us as the real article . They are actually sanctioning the whole bloody --  " " Stop a moment , Carney , " interrupted his wife . " The London chap may be the fraud . Let us go slow , my dear . " " Slow ? How the devil can we go slow in such fast company ? No ! This fellow is the fraud . And they knew it too . They all know it . They --  " " Rubbish ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Medcroft is making love to his wife 's sister . They 're not assuming anything there , let me tell you . And he 's not Edith 's lover . If he 's not her husband , he 's playing a part that she understands and approves . And this -- this , my dear Carney , may account for the imaginary orphanage of Tootles . Dear me , it 's quite a tangle . " " I shall telegraph my solicitors at once for definite news . They 'll know whether the real Medcroft is in London , and then -- well , by Jove , Agatha , I ca n't tell just wot steps I 'll take in regard to these Rodneys . " He went into a long tirade against the unfortunate Seattle-ites , as he called them . " Understand me , Agatha , I do n't blame Mrs. Medcroft . If she 's having an affair with this chap and can pull the wool --  " " But she is n't having an affair with this chap , " cried Mrs. Odell-Carney , her patience exhausted . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes -- Good gracious ! Of course ! Why , what fools we are . The real Medcroft is in London , and it is he who is writing the letters . How stupid of me ! " " Aha ! " exclaimed he triumphantly . " Of course , she 's getting letters from her husband . Why not ? That 's to be expected . But , by the everlasting shagpat , do you suppose that her husband knows she 's off here with another fellow who masquerades as her husband ? No ! " He almost shouted it . " I 've never heard of anything so brazen . ' Gad , what nerve these Americans have . Just to think of it ! " " I do n't believe she is anything of the sort , " declared his wife . " She 's as good as gold . You ca n't fool me , Carney . I know women . " " Deuce take it , Agatha , so do I. And wot 's more , I know men . " " They 're a poor lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kind . He 's a very clever chap and a gentleman . " " Now , look here , Agatha , do n't imagine that I 'm going to be such a cad as to turn against ' em in their hour of trial . Not I. I 'm more their friend than ever . I 'll help ' em to get away from here , and I 'll bulldose these Rodneys into holding their peace forever after . It 's the Rodney duplicity that I ca n't stand . " " Shall we stay here or shall we find an excuse to leave ? " she asked pointedly . " We 'll stay long enough for me to tell the Rodneys wot I think of ' em , I 'll have an answer to my despatch by night . Then , I should advise you to have a talk with Mrs. Medcroft . You 've invited her to the house , you know . Tell her there ca n't be two Medcrofts . See wot I mean ? We 'll see ' em through this , but -- well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter into the department of the police , both directed to Herr Bauer , who in reality was James Githens , of Scotland Yard . The telegram had said : " Why do you say M. is there ? He is in London . Explain . Letter to-morrow . " The letter had come , and Mr. Githens , as well as the local police office , was " bowled over , " to express it in Scotland Yard English . He had wired his employers that " M. is still in Innsbruck . Can not be in London . " It was very clearly set forth in the letter that Roxbury Medcroft was in London , and that Mr. Githens , of Scotland Yard , had betrayed his trust . He was virtually charged with playing into the hands of the enemy ,  --  " selling out , " as it were . It readily may be expected that Mr. Githens was accused of being in the employ of the " opposition . " Moreover , it is but reasonable to assume that he took vigorous steps at once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close behind the heels of a man named Brock . Brock and Constance had ridden off that afternoon to visit the historic Schloss Ambras . The great castle had been saved for the very last of their explorations ; he had just been able to secure permission to visit that part of the Duke 's residence open on certain occasions to the curious public . Edith had declined to accompany them . In the first place , she was expecting the all-important message from her husband -- she was " on nettles , " to quote her plaintive eagerness ; in the second place , she realised that as the crisis was at hand in the affairs of Brock and Constance , her presence was not a necessary adjunct . Not only was she expecting a message from Roxbury , but eagerly anticipating an outburst of joyous news from the two who had , it seemed , very gladly left her behind . The young couple , returning by the lower road from the Schloss , came to a resting place at a little eating-house and garden on the hillside overlooking the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place among the crags , standing in from the white roadway a hundred feet or more , clouded by gorgeous trees and sombre cliffs . It was to this charming , romantic retreat that Brock led his fair , now tremulous inamorata . She , too , knew that the hour for decision had come ; it was in the air , in the glint of his eyes , in the leaping of her heart . And she knew what she would say to him , and what they would say to the world a few hours hence . The mountains seemed to have lost their splendid frown ; they were beaming down upon her , tenderly caressing instead of bleak and foreboding as they always had been before . A rosy-cheeked girl came into the garden to serve them . Swift , cool breezes were scurrying down the valley , bearing in their wake the soft rain clouds that were soon to drench the earth and then radiantly pass on . They were quite alone , seated in the shelter of a wide , overhanging portico . A soft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of the shower . Constance ordered tea and a bite of something to eat for both . Brock 's gaze never left her exquisite face while she was engaged in the pretty but rather self-conscious occupation of instructing the waitress . After the girl had departed , he leaned forward across the little table and said , a trifle hoarsely and disjointedly ,  --  " It was most appetising to watch you do that . I could live forever on nothing but tea and sandwiches if you were to order them . " " You 've said a great many silly things to me this afternoon . " " I wonder --  " he stopped and lowered his voice --  " I wonder if you would call it silly if I were to tell you that I love you , very , very much . " His gloved hand dropped upon hers as she fumbled aimlessly with the menu card ; something in the very helplessness of that long slim hand drew the strength of all his love toward it -- all of this confident , arrogant love that had come to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , dark with the purpose of his passion , took on a new and impelling glow ; she looked into them for an instant , the wavering smile of last resort on her parted lips ; then her lids dropped quickly and her lip trembled . " I should still think you very silly , " she said in a very low voice , " unless -- unless you do love me . " His fingers closed so tightly upon hers that she looked up , her eyes swimming with tenderness . Neither spoke for a long minute , but words were not needed to tell what the soul was saying through the eyes . " I do love you -- you know I do , Connie . I 've loved you from the first day . I can not live without you , Connie , darling , you wo n't keep me waiting ? You will be my wife -- you will marry me at once ? You do love me , I know -- I 've known it for days and days --  " She whimsically broke in upon his passionate declaration , saying with a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceit ! I --  " He laughed joyously . " I never was so sure of anything in my life , " he said . " You could n't help loving me , Constance ; I 've loved you so . You do n't have to tell me , dear ; I know . Still , I 'd like to hear you say , with those dear lips as well as with your eyes , that you love me . " She put her hand upon the back of the broad one which held the other imprisoned ; there was a proud , earnest light in her eyes . " I do love you , " she said simply . " God , but I 'm a happy man , " he exulted . Forgetful of the time and the place , he half arose and , leaning forward , kissed her full upon the upturned lips . There was a rattling of chinaware behind them . In no little confusion both came tumbling down from Paradise , and found themselves under the abashed scrutiny of a very red-faced young serving-woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiably . " I am used to that , madame . A great many ladies and gentlemen come here to -- to -- what you call it ? " She placed the tea and sandwiches before them , her fingers all thumbs , her cheeks aglow . Brock pulled himself together . Very sternly he said : " This young lady is to be my wife . " " Ach , " said Gretchen , with a friendly smile and the utmost deference , " that is what they all say , mein Herr . " Then , giggling approvingly , she bustled away . Brock waited until she was out of sight . " She seems to be onto us , as Freddie would say . But what do we care ? I 'd like to stand on top of the Bandjoch and shout the news to the world . Would n't you , dearest ? " " The world would n't hear us , dear , " she said coolly . " Besides , it 's raining up there . Just look at it sweeping down upon us ! Goodness ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indifferent . " You ca n't turn it off so easily as that , dearest , " he cried . " Come ! While it rains we may plan . You will marry me -- to-morrow ? " " No ! " she cried , aghast . " How utterly ridiculous ! " " Well , then , day after to-morrow ? " " No , no -- nor week after next . I --  " " See here , Connie , we 've got some one else to consider as well as ourselves . In order to square it all up for Edith , we must be able to say to these people that we have n't been frivolling -- that we are going to be married at once . That will let Edith out of the difficulty , and everything will look rosy at the outset . If we put it off , the world will have said things in its ignorance that she can never refute , simply because the world does n't stop long enough to hear two sides of a story unless they are given pretty closely together . Now Edith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable Carneys to rout with our own little bombshell . They 're saying nasty things about all of us . They 're calling you a vile thing for stealing your sister 's husband , and they 're calling me a dog for what I 'm doing . No telling what they 'll be saying if we do n't step into the breach as soon as it is opened . We ca n't afford to wait , no matter what Roxbury says when he comes . We 've just got to be able to forestall even dear old Roxbury . Come ! Do n't you see ? We must be married at once . " Illustration : " ' I do love you , ' she said simply . " " Dear me , " she murmured softly , " what will papa say ? " " My dear Constance , I will explain it all to your father when he gets back from South America next winter . " It was now raining in torrents . They moved back into the darkest recess of their shelter , and blissfully looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet sunshine and fair weather . The clattering of horses ' hoofs upon the hard mountain road sounded suddenly above the hiss of the rain-storm . It was quite dark by this time , night having been hurried on by the lowering skies . A moment later , three horsemen , drenched to the skin , drew up in front of the inn , threw their reins over the posts , and dashed for shelter . They came noisily into the arbour , growling and stamping their soggy feet . " What , ho ! " called one of the newcomers , sticking his head through a window of the house . Brock and Miss Fowler looked on , amused by the plight of the riders . Two of them were unquestionably officers of the police ; the third seemed to be an Englishman . They were gruff , burly fellows , all of them . For a few minutes they stormed and growled about their miserable luck in being caught in the downpour , ordering schnapps and brandy in large and instant quantities . At last the Englishman , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the lovers , who sat quite close together in the dark corner . His gaze developed into a stare , then a look of triumph . A moment later he was pointing out the couple to his companions , all three peering at them with excited eyes . Brock 's face went red under the rude stare ; he was on the point of resenting it when the Englishman stepped forward . The American arose at once . " I 've been looking for you , Mr. Medcroft -- if that is your name , " said the stranger , halting in front of the table . " My name is Githens , Scotland Yard . These men have an order for your arrest . I 'd advise you to go with them peaceably . The young woman will not be bothered . She is free to go . " " What are you talking about ? " demanded Brock angrily . Suddenly he felt a chill of misgiving . What had Roxbury Medcroft been doing that he should be subject to arrest ? " You are masquerading here as Roxbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have watched you for weeks . To-day we have learned that Medcroft is in London . Your linen is marked with a letter B. You 've drawn money on a letter of credit together with a woman who signs herself as Edith F. Medcroft . There is something wrong with you , Mr. B. , and these officers , acting for the hotel and the State Bank , have been instructed to detain you pending an investigation . " Mr. Githens was vindicating himself . He may have been a trifle disconcerted by Miss Fowler 's musical laugh and Brock 's plain guffaw , but he managed to preserve a stiff dignity . " It 's no laughing matter . Officers , this is your man . Take him in charge . Madam , as I understand it , you are the alleged sister of the woman who is working herself off as Mrs. Medcroft . It may interest you to know that your sister -- if she is your sister -- has locked herself in her room and was in hysterics when I left the hotel . She will be carefully guarded , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam , there is as yet no complaint against you , but I wish to notify you that you may consider yourself under surveillance until after your friends have had a hearing before the magistrate to-morrow . As soon as it has ceased raining we will ask you to ride with us to the city . As for Mr. B. , he is in charge of these officers . " At eight o'clock that evening a solemn cavalcade rode into Innsbruck . There were tears of expostulation in the eyes of the lone young woman , flashes of indignation in those of the tall young man who rode beside her . The tall young man was going to gaol ! CHAPTER VII THE THREE GUARDIANS The anti-climax had struck the Hotel Tirol some hours before it came upon Brock and Miss Fowler . It seems that Githens had gone first to the big hostelry in quest of light on the very puzzling dilemma in which he found himself involved . Inquiries at the office only served to stir up a grave commotion among the clerks and managers , all of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deception had been practised . The Tirol did not tolerate anything that savoured of the scandalous ; the Tirol was a respectable house ; the Tirol was ever careful , always rigid in the protection of its good name ; and so on and so forth at great length and with great precision . But Mr. Githens had two officers with him , and he demanded the person of the man calling himself Roxbury Medcroft . The principal bank in the city was also represented in the company of investigators . Likewise there was a laconic gentleman from the British office . Mr. Medcroft was out . Then , they agreed , it was necessary to see Mrs. Medcroft , or the lady representing herself to be such . Mr. Githens was permitted to go to her rooms in company with the manager of the hotel . What transpired in those rooms during the next fifteen minutes would be quite impossible to narrate short of an entire volume . Edith promptly collapsed . Subsequently she became hysterical . She begged for time , and , getting it , proceeded to threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she declared piteously . " Where is the American consul ? I demand the American consul ! " " What has the American government to do with it ? " gruffly demanded Mr. Githens . " Mr. -- Mr.  - -  the gentleman whom you accuse is an American citizen ! " she stammered . " Oho ! Then he is not an Englishman ? " " I refuse to answer your questions . You are impertinent . I ask you , sir , as the manager of this hotel , to eject this man from my rooms . " The manager smiled blandly and did not eject the man . " But , madam , " he said , " we have a right to know who and what you are . If Mr. Medcroft is in London , this gentleman surely can not be he , the real Mr. Medcroft . We must have an explanation . " " I'll -- I will explain everything to-morrow . Oh , by the way , is there a telegram for me in the office ? There must be . I 've been expecting it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is no telegram down there , madam . " At this juncture Mr. Odell-Carney appeared on the scene , uninvited but welcome . " Wot 's all this ? " he demanded sternly . Everybody proceeded at once to tell him . Somehow he got the drift of the story . " Get out -- all of you ! " he said . " I stand sponsor for Mrs. Medcroft . She is Mrs. Medcroft , hang you , sir . If you come around here bothering her again , I 'll have the law upon you . The Medcrofts are English citizens and --  " " Oh , they are , are they ? " sneered Mr. Githens , with a sinister chuckle . " Who the devil are you , sir ? " " I 'm from Scotland Yard . " " I thought so . You 've proved it , ' pon my soul . I am Odell-Carney . Daresay you 've heard of me . " " I know you by sight , sir . But that --  " " Clever chap , by Jove ! And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . I do n't want to know your name . Mrs. Medcroft , will you permit me to send my wife up to you ? Mr. Manager , I insist that you take this c'nfended rabble down to the office and tell them to go to the devil ? Do n't do it up here ; do it down there . " After some further discussion and protest , the Scotland Yard man and his party left the room to its distracted mistress . It may be well to remark , for the sake of local colour , that Tootles was crying lustily , while Raggles barked in spite of all that O'Brien could do to stop him . Odell-Carney sent his wife to Edith . A few minutes later , as he was making his way to the office , he came upon Mrs. Rodney and Katherine , hurrying , white-faced , to their rooms . " Oh , is n't it dreadful ? " wailed the former , putting her clenched hands to her temples . " Is n't wot dreadful ? " demanded he brutally . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not if I can help it , madam . Where is Mr. Rodney ? " " He has n't anything to do with it ! We 're as innocent as children unborn . It 's all shocking to us . Mr. Rodney should n't be arrested . His rectitude is without a flaw . For heaven 's sake , do n't implicate him . He's --  " " Madam , I am not a policeman , " said Odell-Carney with scathing dignity . " I want your husband to aid me in hushing this c'nfended thing . " " He sha n't do it ! I wo n't permit him to be mixed up in it , " almost screamed Mrs. Rodney . " I 've just heard that he is n't a husband at all . It 's atrocious ! " " Bless me , Mrs. Rodney , " roared Odell-Carney , " then you ought n't to be living with him if he is n't your husband . You 're as bad as --  Hi , look out , there ! Do n't do that ! " Mrs. Rodney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . " She 's all upset , Mr. Odell-Carney , " said Katherine , shaking her mother soundly . " It 's just nerves . If you see papa , send him to us . We must take the first train for -- for anywhere . Will you tell Mrs. Odell-Carney that if she 'll get ready at once , papa will see to the tickets . " " Tickets ? But , my dear young lady , we 're not going anywhere . We 're going to stay here and see your cousin out of her troubles . My wife is with her now . " He started away as Mr. Rodney came puffing up the stairs . Odell-Carney changed his mind and waited . " Where 's Edith ? " panted Mr. Rodney . " Good heavens ! " groaned his wife , lowering her voice because three chambermaids were looking on from a near-by turn . " Do n't mention that creature 's name . Just think what she 's got us into . He is n't her husband . Alfred , telephone for tickets on to-night 's train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here another minute . Everybody in the hotel is talking . We 'll all be arrested . " But Mr. Rodney , for once , was the head of the family . He faced her sternly . " Go to your rooms , both of you . We 'll stay here until this thing is ended . I do n't give a hang what she 's done , I 'm not going to desert her . " " But -- but he is n't her husband , " gasped Mrs. Rodney , struck dumb by this amazing rebellion . " But she 's your cousin , is n't she , madam ? " he retorted with fierce irony . " I disown her ! " wailed his wife , sans raison . " Go to your rooms ! " stormed pudgy Mr. Rodney . Then , as they slunk away , he turned to the approving Odell-Carney , sticking out his chest a trifle in his new-found authority . " I say , Carney , what 's to be done next ? " The other looked at him for a moment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the little man 's arm in his . " We 'll have a drink first and then see , " he said . As they were entering the buffet , a cheery voice accosted them from behind . Freddie Ulstervelt came up , real distress in his face . " I say , count me in on this . I 'll buy , if I may . I 've just heard the news from the door porter . Bloody shame , is n't it ? I had Mademoiselle Le Brun over to hear the band concert -- she is related to that painter woman , by the way ; I told Katherine she was . Say , gentlemen , we 'll stand by Mrs. Medcroft , wo n't we ? Count me in . If it 's anything that money can square , I 'm here with a letter of credit six figures long . " " Join us , " said Odell-Carney warmly . " You 're a good sort , after all . " They sat down at a table . Freddie stood between them , a hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I say , gentlemen , we ca n't abandon a woman at a time like this . We must stand together . All true sports and black sheep should stand together , do n't you know . " It is possible that Odell-Carney appreciated the subtlety of this compliment . Not so Mr. Rodney . " Sports ? Black sheep ? Upon my soul , sir , I do n't understand you , " he mumbled . Mr. Rodney , although he hailed from Seattle , had never known anything but a clean and unrumpled conscience . Freddie clapped him jovially on the shoulder . " It 's all right , Mr. Rodney . I 'll take your word for it . But if we are black sheep we sha n't be blackguards . We 'll stand by the ship . What 's to be done ? Bail ' em out ? " It is of record that the three gentlemen were closeted with the officers and managers for an hour or more , but it is not clear that they transacted anything that could seriously affect the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refused point blank to discuss the situation . She did not dare to do or say anything as yet . Her husband had not telegraphed the word releasing her from the sorry compact . She loyally decided to stand by the agreement , no matter what the cost , until she received word from London that he had triumphed or failed in his brave fight against the " bloodsuckers . " " I will explain to-morrow , dear Mrs. Odell-Carney , " she pleaded . " Do n't press me now . Everything shall be all right . Oh , how I wish Constance were here ! She understands . But she 's off listening to silly love talk and does n't even care what happens to me . Burton , will you be good enough to spank Tootles if she does n't stop that screaming ? " By nine o'clock that night every one was discussing the significant disappearance of Constance Fowler and the fraudulent husband of Mrs. Medcroft . Just as Mr. Odell-Carney was preparing to announce to the unfortunate wife that the couple had eloped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , dishevelled , mud-spattered , and hot , but with a look of firm determination in her face . She strode defiantly through the main hall , ignoring the curious gaze of the loungers , whisking the skirt of her habit with disdainful abandon as she passed on to the lift . A few moments later she burst in upon her sister , a very angry young person indeed . The Odell-Carneys were down the hall discussing her strange defection ; it was with no little relief that they saw her enter the room . " Are we alone ? " demanded Miss Fowler , not giving Edith time to proclaim her joy at seeing her . " Well , I 've arranged a way to get him out , " she went on , her lips set . " Out ? " murmured Mrs. Medcroft . " Of course . We ca n't let him stay in there all night , Edith . How much money have you ? Hurry up , please ! Do n't stare ! " " In where ? Who 's in where ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have n't you heard ? " Mrs. Medcroft began to cry . " Mr. Brock in gaol ? Good heavens , what shall I do ? I -- I was depending on him so much . He ought to be here at this very instant . What has he been doing ? " " Edith Medcroft , stop sniffling , and do n't think of yourself for a while . It will do you a great deal of good . Where 's your money ? " Ruthlessly she began to rummage Edith 's treasure trunk . The other came to her assistance after a dazed interval . The family purse came to light . " I have a little over four thousand crowns , " she murmured helplessly . " Give it me , quick . There 's no time to waste . I have about five thousand . It 's all in notes , thank heaven . It is n't quite enough , but I 'll try to make it do . Do n't stop me , Edith . I have n't time to answer questions . He 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love him ! " " But the -- the money ? Is it to bail him out with ? " " Bail ? No , my dear , it 's to buy him out with . ' Sh ! Is there any one in that room ? Well , then , I 'll tell you something . " The heads of the two sisters were quite close together . " He 's in a cell at the -- the prison-hof , or whatever you call it in German . It 's gaol in English . I have arranged to bribe one of the gaolers -- his guard . He will let him escape for ten thousand crowns -- we must do it , Edith ! Then Mr. Brock will ride over the Brenner Pass and catch a train somewhere , before his escape is discovered . I expect to meet him in Paris day after to-morrow . Have you heard from Roxbury ? " " No ! " wailed Roxbury 's wife . " He 's a brute ! " stormed Miss Fowler . " Constance ! " flared Mrs. Medcroft , aghast at this sign of lese-majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she banged the door behind her . Soon after midnight a closely veiled lady drove up to a street corner adjacent to the city prison , a dolorous-looking building which loomed up still and menacing just ahead . She alighted and , dismissing the cab , strode off quickly into the side street . At a distant corner , in front of a crowded eating-house , two spirited horses , saddled and in charge of a grumbling stable-boy , champed noisily at their bits . The young woman exchanged a few rapid sentences with the boy , and then returned in the direction from which she came . A man stepped out of a doorway as she neared the corner , accosting her with a stealthy deference that proclaimed him to be anything but an unwelcome marauder . The conversation which passed between the slender , nervous young woman and this burly individual was carried on in very cautious tones , accompanied by many quick and furtive glances in all directions , as if both were in fear of observers . At last , after eager pleading on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package passed from the hand of the young woman into the huge paw of the man . The latter gave her a quick , cautious salute and hurried back toward the gaol . The veiled young woman , very nervous and strangely agitated , made her way back to the spot where the horses were standing . Making her way through the cluster of small tables which lined the inner side of the sidewalk , she found one unoccupied at the extreme end , a position which commanded a view of the street down which she had just come . Half an hour passed . Midnight revellers at the surrounding tables began to take notice of this tall , elegant , nervous young woman with the veiled face . It was plain to all of them that she was expecting someone ; naturally it would be a man , therefore a lover . Her nervousness grew as the minutes lengthened into the hour . A clock in a tower near by struck one . She was now staring with wide , eager eyes down the street , alertly watching the approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half arose and started forward with a quick sigh of relief , only to sink back again dejectedly upon discovering that she had been mistaken in the identity of a newcomer . Half-past one , then two o'clock . The merry-makers were thinning out ; she was quite alone at her end of the place . By this time a close observer might have noticed that she was trembling violently ; there was an air of abject fear and despair in her manner . Why did he not come ? What had happened ? Had the plot failed ? Was he even now lying wounded unto death as the result of his effort to escape captivity ? A hundred horrid thoughts raced through her throbbing , overwrought brain . He should have been with her two hours ago -- he should now be far on his way to freedom . Alas , something appalling had happened , she was sure of it . At last there hove in sight , coming from the direction in which lay the prison , a group of three men . It was a jaunty party , evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms linked , with dignified but unsteady gait , their hats well back on their heads . In the middle was a very tall man , flanked on one side by a very short fat one , on the other by a slender youth who wanted to sing . She recognised them and would have drawn back to a less exposed spot , but the slender youth saw her before she could do so . He shouted to his companions as if they were two blocks away . " There she is ! Hooray ! " They bore down upon her . The next instant they were solemnly shaking hands with her , much to her dismay . " Cons'ance , we 've been lookin ' f-fer you ever ' - where in town . W-where on earth ' ve you been ? " asked Mr. Rodney thickly , with a laudable attempt at severity . " Ever sinch ' leven o'clock , Conshance , " supplemented Freddie , trying to frown . " My dear Miss F-Fowler , " began Odell-Carney in , his most suave manner , " it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You -- you should n't be sittin ' here all ' lone thish -- this hour in the morning . Please come home with us . Your mother hash -- has ask us to fetch you -- I mean your sister . Beg pardon . " " I -- I can not go , gentlemen , " she stammered . " Please do n't insist -- please do n't ask why . I can not go --  " " I shay , Conshance , by Jove , the joke 's on you , " exclaimed Freddie . " I know who ' t ish you 're waitin ' f-for . Well , he ca n't come . He 's locked in . " " Freddie , you are drunk ! " in deep scorn . " I know it , " he admitted cheerfully . " We 've looked ever'where for you . We 're your frien 's . He said it was at ' n eatin ' - house . We 've been ever ' eatin ' - house in Inchbrook . Was here first of all . Leave it to Rodney . Wassen we , Rodney ? You bet we was . You wassen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conshance . ' S all right . He 's safe . He ca n't come . " " But he will come , unless something terrible has happened to him , " she almost sobbed in her desperation . " Cousin Alfred , wo n't you go to the gaol and see what has happened ? " Mr. Rodney took off his hat gallantly and would have gone to do her bidding had not Mr. Odell-Carney laid a restraining grip upon his shoulder . " Let me explain , Miss F-Fowler . You shee -- see , he told us you 'd be here , but , hang it all , you wassen here wh-when we came . Never give up , says I to my frien 's . We 'll search till doomshday . I knew we 'd find you if we kep ' on searching . Thash jus ' wot I said to Roddy , didn ' I , Roddy ? We mush have overlokked yo ' when we were here at ' leven . " " I was not here at eleven , " she cried breathlessly . " Thash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted Freddie triumphantly . " I saysh : ' What 's use lookin ' here ? She -- she is n't on top of any these tables , ' an ' I -- I knew you wassen unner ' em . You ain't --  " " Permit me , " interrupted Odell-Carney with grave dignity . " Your friend , Miss Fowler , is not in gaol . He is out --  " " Not in gaol ! " she almost shrieked . " I knew it ! I knew it could not go wrong . But where is he ? " " He 's out on bail . We bailed him out at half-past ten -- Wot ! " She had leaped to her feet with a short scream and was clutching his arm frantically . " On bail ? At half-past ten ? Good heavens , then -- then -- oh , are you sure ? " " Poshtive , abs'lutely . " " Then what has become of my nine thousand crowns ? " " You c'n search me , Conshance , " murmured Freddie . " I don ' know what you ' re talkin ' ' bout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . " We -- we put up security f'r five thous'n dollars , that 's what we did . This is all the thanks we getsh for it . Ungrachful ! " Constance had been thinking very hard , paying no heed to his maudlin defence . It rapidly was dawning upon her that these men had secured her lover 's release on bail at half-past ten o'clock , an hour and a half before she had given her bribe of nine thousand crowns to the gaoler . That being the case , it was becoming clear to her that the wretch deliberately had taken the money , knowing that Brock was not in the prison , and with the plain design to rob her of the amount . It was a transaction in which he could be perfectly secure ; bribing of public officials is a solemn offence in Austria and Germany . She could have no recourse , could make no complaint . Her money was gone ! " Where is Mr. Br -- Mr . Medcroft ? " she demanded , her voice full of anxiety . If he were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting-place ? " He 's locked in , " persisted Freddie . " That 's just it , Miss Fowler , " explained Odell-Carney glibly . " You shee -- see , it was this way : we got him out on bail on condition he 'd ' pear to-morrow morning ' fore the magistrate . Affer we 'd got him out , he insisted on coming ' round here so 's he could run away with you . That wassen a gennelmanly thing to do , affer we 'd put up our money . We coul'n ' afford have him runnin ' away with you . So we had him locked in a room on top floor of the hotel , where he ca n't get out ' n ' leave us to hold the bag , do n't you see . He almos ' cried an ' said you 'd be waitin ' at the church or -- or something like that bally song , do n't you know , an ' as a lash reshort , to keep him quiet like a good ferrer -- feller , we said we 'd come an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sassisfac'rly . " She looked at then with burning eyes . Slow rage was coming to the flaming point ; And for this she had sat and suffered for hours in a street restaurant ! For this ! Her eyes fell upon the limp horses and the dejected stable-boy . Two hours ! " You will release him at once ! " she stormed . " Do you hear ? It is outrageous ! " Without another word to the dazed trio , she rushed to the curb and commanded the boy to assist her into the saddle . He did so , in stupid amazement . Then she instructed him to mount and follow her to the Tirol as fast as he could ride . The horses were tearing off in the darkness a moment later . The three guardians stood speechless until the clatter died away in the distance . Then Mr. Rodney pulled himself together with an effort and groaned in abject horror . " By thunner , the damn girl is stealin ' somebody 's horshes ! " CHAPTER VIII THE PRODIGAL HUSBAND The unlucky Brock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison in the top storey of the Tirol from eleven o'clock till two , bitterly cursing the fools who were keeping him in durance more vile than that from which they had generously released him . He realised that it would be unwise to create a disturbance in the house by clamouring for freedom , because , in the first place , there already had been scandal enough , and in the second place , his distrustful bondsmen had promised faithfully to seek out the devoted Connie and apprise her of his release . He had no thought , of course , that in the mean time she might be duped into paying a bribe to the guard . Not only was he direfully cursing the trio , but also the addlepated Medcroft and his own addlepated self . It is to be feared that he had harsh thoughts of all the Medcrofts , as far down as Raggles . His dream of love and happiness had turned into a nightmare ; the comedy had become a tragic snarl of all the effects known to melodrama . Bitterly he lamented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics in the morning and proclaim to them that Constance was his wife . From this , it readily may be judged that Brock was not familiar with all the details of the vigorous Miss Fowler 's plan . As a matter of fact , he did not know that he was expected to fly the country like a fugitive . She had known in her heart that he would never agree to a plan of that sort ; it was , therefore , necessary for her to deceive him in more ways than one . Plainly speaking , Brock had laboured under the delusion that she merely proposed to bribe the gaoler into letting him off for the night , in order that by some hook or crook they could be married early in the morning -- provided her conception of the State marriage laws as they applied to aliens was absolutely correct . ( It was not correct , it may be well to state , although that has nothing to do with the case at this moment . ) If he had but known that she contemplated paying ten thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he was expected to catch a night train across the border , it is only just to his manhood to say that he should have balked , even though the act were to cost him years of prison servitude -- which , of course , was unlikely in the face of the explanation that would be made in proper time by the real Medcroft . It thus may be seen that Brock not only had been vilely imprisoned twice in the same night , but that he was very much in the dark , notwithstanding his attempt to make light of the situation . It occurred to him , at two o'clock , that pacing the floor in the agony of suspense was a very useless occupation . He would go to bed . Morning would bring relief and surcease to his troubled mind . Constance was doubtless sound asleep in her room . Everything would have been explained to her long before this hour ; she would understand . So , with the return of his old sophistry , he undressed and crawled into the strange bed . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the balcony below . Just as he was dropping off into the long-delayed slumber , he heard a light tapping at his door . He sat up in bed like a flash , thoroughly wide awake . The rapping was repeated . He called out in cautious tones , asking who was there , at the same time slipping from bed to fumble in the darkness for his clothes . " ' Sh ! " came from the hallway . He rushed over and put his ear to the door . " It is I. Are you awake ? I ca n't stay here . It 's wrong . Listen : here is a note -- under the door . Good night , darling ! I 'm heartbroken . " " Thank God , it 's you ! " he cried softly . " How I love you , Constance ! " " ' Sh ! Edith is with me ! Oh , I wish it were morning and I could see you . I have so much to say . " Another querulous voice broke in : " For heaven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our reputations are bad enough as it is . Good night -- Roxbury ! " He distinctly heard the heartless Edith giggle . Then came the soft , quick swish of garments and the nocturnal visitors were gone . He picked up the envelope and , waiting until they were safely down the hall , turned on the light . " Dearest , " he read , " it was not my fault and I know it was not yours . But , oh , you do n't know how I suffered all through those hours of waiting at the cafe . They did not find me until after two . They were drunk . They tried to explain . What do you think the authorities will do to me if they find that I gave that horrid man bribe money ? Really , I 'm terribly nervous . But he wo n't dare say anything , will he ? He is as guilty as I , for he took it . He took it knowing that you were free at the time . But we will talk it over to-morrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't go to bed until Edith brought me up to hear your dear voice . I am so glad you are not dead . It is impossible to release you to-night . Those wretches have the key . How I loathe them ! Edith says the hotel is wild with gossip about everything and everybody . It 's just awful . Be of good heart , my beloved . I will be your faithful slave until death . With love and adoration and kisses . Your own Constance . " P.S. Roxbury has not made a sign , Edith is frantic . " Several floors below the relieved and ecstatic Brock , Mrs. Medcroft was soon urging her sister to go to bed and let the story go until daylight . She persisted in telling all that she had done and all that she had endured . " We must never let him know that we actually gave that wretch nearly twenty-five hundred dollars , Edith . He would never forgive us . I admit that I was a fool and a ninny , so do n't tell me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking that you 're just crazy to . It 's all Roxbury 's fault , anyway . Why should he get up and make a speech in London without letting us know ? Just see how it has placed us ! I think Mr. Brock is an angel to do what he has done for you and Roxbury . Yes , my dear , you will have to confess that Roxbury is a brute -- a perfect brute . I 'm sure , if you have a spark of fairness in you , you must hate him . No , no ! Do n't say anything , Edith . You know I 'm right . " " I 'm not going to say anything , " declared Edith angrily . " I 'm going to bed . " " Edith , if you do n't mind , dear , I think I 'll sleep with you . " After a moment of deep reflection she added plaintively : " There is so much that I just have to tell you , deary . It -- it wo n't keep till daylight . " Bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were routed from their rooms by a demand from the management of the hotel that they appear forthwith in the private office . This order included every member of Mr. Rodney 's party , excepting the Medcroft baby . Considerably distressed and very much concerned over the probable outcome of the conference , the Rodney forces made their way to the offices -- not altogether in an open fashion , but by humiliatingly unusual avenues . The Rodney family came down the back stairs . Brock was solemnly ushered through the public office by Mr. Odell-Carney and Freddie Ulstervelt . It is not stretching the truth to say that they were sour and sullen , but , as may be suspected , from peculiarly different causes . At last all were congregated in the stuffy office , very much subdued and very much at odds with each other . Mr. Githens was there . Likewise the gentleman from the bank and a prominent person from the department of police . Miss Fowler glanced about uneasily , and was relieved to discover that her treacherous gaoler was not there to confront her with charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , have tricked her into committing a crime against the government . It was quite noticeable that Mrs. Rodney and Katherine did not speak to the Medcroft contingent -- in fact , they ignored them quite completely . Mrs. Rodney was very pale and very deeply distressed . She cast many glances at the red-eyed and sheepish Mr. Rodney ,  - -  glances that meant much to the further torture of his soul . " I am sorry to inform you , Herr Rodney , that the rooms which you now occupy , and those of your friends , are no longer at your disposal . They have been engaged for from sometime this day by a --  " " Look here , " interrupted Odell-Carney bluntly , " if you mean that we are not wanted here any longer , why not say so ? Do n't lie about it . We are leaving to-day , in any event , so wot 's the odds ? Now , come down to facts : why are we summoned here like a crowd of school children ? " The manager looked at Mr. Githens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems that Herr Grabetz of the police department desires to ask some questions of your party in my presence . You will understand , sir , that the hotel has been imposed upon by -- by these people . It seems , also , that the bank insists upon having some light thrown upon the methods by which Mrs. Medcroft secures money on her letter of credit . " " You are welcome to all that , sir , " declared Mr. Odell-Carney , " but I am interested to know just why my wife and I are brought into this affair . " " Because you are guests of Mr. Rodney , sir , I regret to state . We have no complaint against you , sir . You are well known here . The -- the others are not . They are -- what you call it ? Humbugs ! It may be that they also have swindled you ! " Mr. Rodney , at this point , leaped to his feet and rushed over to shake his fist in the face of the insulting hotel man . But Edith Medcroft arose suddenly , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined voice stilling the turbulent spirit of her outraged host . " One moment , please , " she said . " This all can be satisfactorily explained . No wrong has been done . It will all be cleared up in time . We --  " " In time ? " interrupted the manager . " Madam , this is the time . You are here with a man who is not your husband , yet who purports to be such . " " It may throw some light on the matter if I announce that the gentleman in question is my affianced husband . " It was Miss Fowler who spoke . Every one stared at her as she moved over to Brock 's side . " If you will look in the office , you will find a telegram there for me , " went on Mrs. Medcroft , pale but absolutely confident . The manager called out through the door . Absolute silence reigned while the reply was awaited . " No telegram for Mrs. Medcroft last night or to-day , " announced the manager sternly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are four here for a Mr. Brock , who has not yet arrived in --  " " Brock ! " shouted three voices in one . A tall man , forgetting his English and his eyeglass , sprang forward and grabbed the telegrams from the manager 's hand . " Holy mackerel ! Give ' em here ! " he shouted . Two eager , beautiful young women were hanging to his elbows as he ruthlessly broke one of the seals . " The chump ! It 's from Rox ! They 're all from Rox -- and they are two or three days old ! " Just then the unexpected happened . The office door opened with a bang , and the real Roxbury Medcroft stepped into the room . He halted just inside the door and looked about in momentary bewilderment . " This is a private --  " began the manager , stepping forward . A flying figure sped past him ; a delighted little shriek rang in his ears . He saw Edith Medcroft hurl herself into the arms of her own husband . At the same moment Brock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruder . " Good Gawd ! " gasped Odell-Carney . " Wot 's all this ? " His wife suddenly began fanning herself , searching for breath . " This is my husband ! " cried Edith , triumph in her voice , tears in her eyes , as she faced the astonished observers . " Now , what have you to say ? " It was a perfectly natural but not an especially obvious question . The little manager threw up his hands and cried out in a sad mixture of French , English and Helvetian ,  --  " What ? Another husband ? Madam , how many more do you propose to inflict us with ? We can not allow it ! The management will not permit you to change husbands the instant a new guest arrives in the house . It is not to be heard of -- no , no ! " " Are you afraid that the books wo n't balance ? " asked Brock with a joyous grin , a great load off his heart . " Ladies and gentlemen , permit me to introduce Mr. Roxbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband of this lady , not I. I am to be the husband of this lady , thank God . " There was a moment of absolute silence -- it may have been stupor . The two audiences faced each other with emotions widely at variance . It was Mrs. Rodney who spoke first . " Is this true , Edith ? " she quavered . " Yes , yes , yes ! " cried Edith , her eyes dancing . " Then , what are you doing here with a man who is n't your husband ? " demanded Mrs. Rodney , suddenly aflame . " I can explain everything to you later on , Mrs. Rodney , " interposed Mrs. Odell-Carney calmly . She had divined at least a portion of the truth , and she was clever enough to put herself on the right side . Edith cast an involuntary look of surprise at the Englishwoman . " I have known everything from the first . Mrs. Medcroft and I are closer friends than you may have thought . " She gave Edith a meaning look , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the private office : " My dear , I do n't know what it means , but you must tell me everything as soon as possible . I am your friend . Whatever it all is , it 's ripping ! " There was a great deal of pow-wowing and chatter , charges and refutations , excuses and explanations . Mr. Medcroft finally waved every one aside in the most degage manner imaginable . " Do n't crowd me ! Hang it all , I 'm not a curiosity . There is n't anything to go crazy about . My friend , Mr. Brock , has just done me a trifling favour . That 's all . The whole story will be in the London papers this morning . Buy ' em . I 'm going up to my wife 's room to see my baby . I 'll come down and explain everything when I 've had a bit of a breathing spell . It 's annoying to have had this fuss about a simple little matter of generosity on the part of my friend , who , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll see to it , by Gad , that he receives the proper apologies . And , for that matter , my wife may have something to say about the outrage that has been perpetrated . " He took it all very much as if the world owed him an explanation and not vice versa . As he was stalking from the room , Brock bethought himself to ask ,  --  " When did you arrive , old man ? " " Last night on the 12.10 . I registered as Smith . It was so late that I decided not to disturb Edith . They said in the office that you 'd gone to bed , Brock . Now that I recall it , they said it in a very odd way too . In fact , one of the clerks asked if I had it in for you too . " " You were here all night ? " murmured Constance in plaintive misery . " Well , not precisely all night , Connie . Half of it , " replied Roxbury . " Brock , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to meet me at the station . I telegraphed twice from London and --  " " Do n't call me an ass , " grated Brock . " Why did n't you send ' em to me as Medcroft ? I have n't been Brock until this very morning . " " ' Pon my soul , Brock , it was rather stupid of me , " he confessed sheepishly . " But , you see , " with an inspired smile , " one of ' em was to congratulate you on winning Connie . By Jove , you know , I could n't very well address that one to myself . " " But -- but he had n't won me , " stammered Constance Fowler . " Edith , " said Roxbury , deep reproach in his voice , " you wrote me that a week ago ! " Edith merely squeezed his arm . Odell-Carney came forward and extended his hand . " Permit me to introduce myself , sir . I am George Odell-Carney . It has given me great pleasure to serve you without knowing you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demmed bounder , a deceived husband , a betrayed lover , a successful lover , and a lot of other things I ca n't just now recall . Acting on the presumption that you might have been a friend in distress , I worked hard in your interest . Now I discover , to my gratification , you are a perfect stranger whom I am proud to meet . Permit me to offer my warmest felicitations and to assure you that Mr. Brock will make a splendid brother-in-law . " He hesitated a moment and then went on : " So you are the chap that really put in those c'nfended memorial windows . ' Pon me word , sir , they are the rottenest --  " " Carney ! " came the sharp reminder from his wife . " I should have said , " revised Mr. Odell-Carney , " you are the chap who played the deuce with the building grafters in the County Council . Remarkable ! " " Yes , " said Roxbury , striving to grasp something of the situation as it appeared to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will never go to the Council . The sub-committee will not recommend it . Thanks , Brock , old man ; you have saved London a good many millions , I daresay . It was you who did it , after all . " Before noon the hotel was agog with the full details of the remarkable story . Cabled despatches in the newspapers gave the gist of the clever trick played by the Medcrofts , and the whole of England was to ring with the stories of Mrs. Medcroft 's pluck and devotion . Everybody was buying the papers and staring with admiration at Mrs. Medcroft . The management of the Tirol implored the Medcrofts to remain -- forever ! The bank and the police were profuse in apologies and explanations , and Mr. Githens departed by the first train . Freddie Ulstervelt , killing two birds with one stone , arranged a splendid dinner for that night in honour of the prodigal husband of Edith and also in open compliment to the vivacious Mademoiselle Le Brun . Later in the day , it occurred to him that he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he planned to announce the betrothal of Miss Fowler and Mr. Brock , the wedding to take place a fortnight hence in Mayfair . The Rodneys were invited to " stop over " for the spread . It is left for the reader to supply the answer to this simple question ,  --  Did they stop over ? ***
