There are cases , however , especially for the pianist , in complicated passages formed of many notes that succeed each other with extreme rapidity , where this intelligent and rational memory , which demands an effort of reflection , might find itself at fault . Then becomes valuable the mechanical and unthinking memory of the fingers , which correctly and faithfully accomplish their task like veritable automata , when they have been sufficiently trained , without any cerebral effort , and even while we may be thinking of something entirely different . I do not know how physiology or the psychologist explains this phenomenon of dual thought-action , but it is indubitably real . There are some persons who can play for you a piece heavily charged with notes while listening to others talking around them and even taking part in the conversation . To assert that they put deep feeling into their playing at the same time , I should not dare . And this is why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be clothed in turn , and sometimes simultaneously , with these three forms : memory of the eyes , car and fingers . If we possess one of these , we must train for the others ; they will naturally aid each other . More than any other instrumentalists , pianists should give their whole attention to the study of reading at sight , because of the great number of notes that they have to read , whether simultaneously or very rapidly . From the third year , at the latest , it 100 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS is necessary to devote a few moments every day to reading slowly things that are easy enough to be read without making any mistakes ( I have already said this , but it can not be repeated too often ) , with-out hesitating or stumbling , and even to putting in all the shading indicated ; it is only on this condition that this study is profitable . Before reading any piece whatsoever , short or developed , you should go over it slowly , examining very particularly such pas-sages as seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop under any pretext whatsoever ; it would be better to invent several notes , indeed even several bars , than to stop and begin again . You must possess " a complete absence of remorse for any mistake made , " according to the pretty expression of Eugene Sauzay , * a celebrated violinist who was a per-fect master of accompaniment as well as a man of wit and erudition . It is imperative to know how to divine from the figure what we have no time to read , and always to read ahead , at least one bar in slow move-ments , and several in pieces of a lively gait . To know how to read well , a thing precious above all else , is an accomplishment of combined intelligence , ability , and presence of mind . J. J. Rousseau said long ago in his dictionary : " All musicians pride themselves upon playing at sight , but there are very few who in this execution catch the spirit of the work , or who , even if they make no mistakes in the notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution . " MUSICAL EDUCATION With modern music , reading has become in itself a veritable art , and really a very difficult one . Four-hand reading is very good practice , still better than with two pianos , whether with the teacher or with a partner of about the same skill . The pianist should also be equally accustomed to the difficulties of transposition , more complicated for him than for any other instrumentalists , because he has infinitely more notes to read than they have . Ile should therefore train himself very early in transposing even exercises . Apart from the utility of knowing how to transpose , this study forms an excellent gymnastic exercise and helps to form a musician . When we have acquired complete mastery of an instrument , and can play without having to pay attention to the minute details of execution , it is worth while to take ensemble lessons with a violinist or ' cellist ( inaccurately called lessons of accompaniment , because the piano does not accompany more than it is accompanied , it is absolutely a concerted instrument ) ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some entirely different instrument , but we should quickly come to the end of the catalogue of good works written for the piano and clarinet , flute , oboe , horn or bassoon , while the literature for the stringed instruments is nearly inexhaustible . After getting accustomed to playing with a single instrument , you can take up the study of Trios , Quartets , Quintets , etc. , which is exceedingly interesting . This interest lies very largely in the enormous num-102 TIIF STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS ber of masterpieces that the classic authors and a few contemporaries have written for Chmnber-music , the most elevated form of pure music ; partly also in the pleasure caused by the mingling of ' the thnbres . The pianist here is obliged to play otherwise than as a soloist , to modify and frequently to diminish his tone , in order to assimilate and to ally himself with the other instruments , which lie should never try to dominate except in particular passages where his part preponderates . Finally , it is an entirely special study . It is also a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accompany is in its place , meaning a complete abnegation , with the one desire of supporting the singer , aiding him and sometimes guiding him , without ever covering his voice . This talent of being a good accompanist is very rare , and one that always denotes an excellent musician , for it requires all the qualities of a virtuoso , and in addition a tact and a presence of mind that are very difficult to acquire . In every kind of ensemble music , there can be no question of playing by heart . No matter how sure you may be of your memory , you can not be responsible for the errors into which you may be led through the inadvertence of a partner . Whether it is a question of the study of the piano , sight-reading or ensemble music , the foundation should always consist of classical music , or that of contemporary composers who have written in the classical style ; for the primary or secondary instruction , it is also necessary to adhere to these ; then a part of 103 MUSICAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with extreme circumspection , and avoiding all vulgar and unhealthy compositions that unfortunately are rapidly multiplying . Schumann expresses himself clearly upon this subject : " You should never play bad compositions , nor listen to them , if you are not compelled to . " I believe that this is forcible enough . Elsewhere , he goes still further and seems to invest the pupil with the somewhat excessive functions of a severe censor : " Never spread abroad had compositions , on the contrary help to suppress them with energy . " The pupil should not yet trust entirely to his own discernment ; to a great extent it is in this choice that the tact of the professor is show n . The works of Schumann , Chopin and their followers of the Romantic School , demanding more maturity , should riot figure in the programme of any one before the age of fifteen or sixteen except as hors-d'a'uvres and as pieces for occasional ambitious flights ; up to this period , the pure classic Germans must be studied exclusively , notably Haydn , Mozart , Bach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etudes , Cramer and Clementi , in his marvellous collection of Gradus ad Parnassum ) ; for a stronger reason , Liszt and the school of transcendent virtuosity will be reserved for the finishing touch of the studies and should not be touched before the age of eighteen or twenty . Here , as everywhere else , there may be exceptions , extraordinarily precocious natures ; it is for the professor to judge of these ; but also not to allow himself to be deceived by appearances , nor carried away L104 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS by the desire to give pleasure to his pupils or to their parents ; he should represent wisdom and prudence . Upon this subject , it will not be out of place to put an end to that misunderstanding , that false notion of words and things , that for many young pupils makes classic the synonym for tedious , while modern suggests the idea of what is anrusiug . It is impossible to imagine a more complete error . Among the ancients as among our contemporaries , there are composers who are gay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , often would be better , the same composer alternately assumes the two aspects . If Bach is austere in his fugues , that does not prevent him from writing gavottes and other pieces in an alert and joyous style ; there is no music that is more delightful and witty , more tender and playful than that of Mozart and Ibaydn , more warm , passionate and dramatic than that of Beethoven . We must also take into consideration that what we call in musical matters the classics , are not strictly speaking ancients , they are the moderns of yesterday consecrated by admiral ion , Nebo directly gave birth to the style of to-day . If we say that every well ordered study should begin with the pure classics , it is to confine ourselves in this chapter to considerations of dry pedagogy , and not embarrass ourselves with questions of esthetics that will find their place elsewhere , because the classic school initiates us progressively into the present manner of writing , and leads us logically towards it , while the modern school , which is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 105 MUSICAL EDUCATION the old Masters . This at least is the principal reason to be considered by those pupils who desire to follow a normal progress ; professors of some little experience will be able to find several others which there is no need here to indicate to them . As soon as the young pupil begins to play properly several little pieces and knows I hem by heart , it is indispensable to accustom him to play them before people , without any airs and without waiting to be begged , which is the worst possible taste . This should first happen before one 's own family and a few intimate friends who are kindly disposed ( it is not a treat that is offered to them , it is a service that is demanded of them ) , then gradually before more numerous audiences . At this age , a child does not know what fear is , of that stupid and paralyzing thing not a trace is known , and this habit of playing before people is formed quite naturally and is never lost . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of self-love , conies into play , and the greatest amount of form and ceremony is required to induce the young virtuoso to play before those friends who are the most kindly disposed towards him . This is absurd , but it is so , above all with young girls . Now , it is absolutely necessary to avoid this pretentious shyness , and the most certain way is to take it in hand at an early period . Music is before everything else an art that belongs to society , and the executant , whether artist or amateur , it matters little , has no reason for existence except when someone is listening to him , someone whom he is trying to 106 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS make participate in his sensations of art . He who never plays except for himself alone would be above all a perfect egoist in the first place , and , secondly , to speak the truth , he would not even need to learn the mastery of his instrument , it would suffice for him to learn to read music fluently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apparatus have been invented with the purpose of developing , by methods of gymnastics , the strength and suppleness of the fingers : the Daetr/-lion of Henri Herz , the Clairogymnuste of Henri Martin , the Veloce-mano , the leaden rings , the handguides ( chiroplast ) , the dumb pianos with progressive stiffness , and many others which would look terrible if they figured in the museum of instruments of torture at Nuremberg . All these mechanical devices are detestable or inefficacious , and I only speak of them here for the sake of strongly discouraging their use . With means of this nature , employed against my will , many of my pupils have gravely compromised their progress ; one of them , Mr. Louis H of St. Louis , Missouri , by making use of an extraordinary and complicated apparatus which he made himself and with which he slept to force his fingers further and further apart , succeeded in crippling them completely . A similar mishap had already occurred to Robert Schumann : with the aim of improving his technique , and unknown to his most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie down his third finger firmly , while exercising the four others . The result was that the 107 MUSICAI. 11 ) UCATION third finger was attacked by paralysis , which soon put it out of service , and paralysis progressively attacked the entire hand . All these machines must be deliberately rejected , for Ivhcu not dangerous they are useless . Certain auxiliary studies should be taken along with that of the piano . Just as , during the primary period , we must consider solfeggio as indispensable , and pursue this study long and seriously , it is well that , having once gained a step higher , the young pianist should possess some notions of harmony ; superficial notions , if you please , for the amateur who is only trying to gain a more complete understanding of the works he is studying , but not ions that must be infinitely more extended for the art ist who intends to develop himself in the art o ' interpretation , and who may , moreover , one day or of her be also a composer , which very frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion to speak of later , the influence of the instruments of the keyboard upon musical inspiration and fecundity . This study of harmony is not imposed upon any other instrumentalist with the same character of use ' fulness as upon the pianist . In reality , the piano , the polyphonic instrument , par excellence , is the one which by its very construction is able to produce the greatest number of simultaneous sounds ( with the exception of the grand organ ) , that which admits of the greatest complications , various parts that are entangled , combining with one another superimposed melodies that form counterpoint , chords , or arpeggios 108 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS bristling with accidentals which are not ahvays easy to read correctly or to interpret well , unless we have the power of making a quick analysis , and thus penetrating and divining the intention of ? the author . A pianist is not complete unless he is also a harmonist , were it only for the sake of being able to rectify , in case of need , the mistakes in printing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works so complex as arc those which are written to-day for the piano . But this is the least of its uses . To know how to understand and appreciate the beauty of the works which he interprets is indispensable in order that he may execute them properly , for by execution we do not mean merely a correct interpretation , but an interpretation that is intelligent , interesting and elevated , which can not be attained without taking their structure and harmonic framework into account . Despite an old prejudice which semis to be disappearing , it is not at all hurtful for a pianist to play the organ , even if he has no idea of becoming an organist . This prejudice may have had some justification formerly , when the organ keys were very stiff and hard to work ; up to a certain point , they might make the touch heavy and deprive it of some of its delicacy ; but nothing of this is to be feared to-day , for the manufacturers are able to render the touch of the organ as light as that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schumann 's opinion : " Do not neglect any opportunity of practicing on the organ ; there is no instrument so efficacious in cor-109 MUSICAL EDUCATION rccting the errors or the habits of a bad musical education . " What the organ teaches you is to avoid a skipping , dry , superficial and unstable mcthod of playing ; and also , inversely , the heavy and slovenly method of those who drag their fingers over the keys , neglecting to let them recover at the proper time , for these two faults are intolerable ; it is like it microscope that magnifies all defects , showing them in their most hideous aspect . It teaches integrity of technique . Everybody has not it Grand Orgauc at his disposal ; but it Itariuoniuin , which can render a similar service , is more frequently met with . l'lacv upon this instrutnciit ( or it Grand Organ ) it Mich fugnc from the 11'c11-VcinPcrcd Clavier for example , or it piece of ILmdel 's , having previously studied them carefully upon the piano where they seemed to be correctly rendered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will discover , notes released too soon , held too long , unevennesses , gaps , etc . This will make you more careful about your rendering before you try it new experiment . Finally , it is necessary that the pianist , without consequent conceit , should realize that , by the very nature of his instrument , he is able to become a more perfect musician than any otlier virtuoso . None , in reality , finds himself confronted with more complications in rapid passages ? I am not speaking of the material difficulties , ? no one else has to make several melodic parts heard simultaneously , nor to bring out a song with one liand while with the other , and very 110 THE S'PIIDY OF INSTRUMENTS often the same , he must preserve a relative but real interest in figures of accompaniment , arpeggios , or contrapuntal formulw . The literature of the piano , in works of the highest style , is the most complex of all musical literatures . By its compass , that is greater than that of the orchestra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effects , the piano authori tatively seizes the preponderant rule , whcrever it is found . In Chamber-music , in String Quartets , Quintets , Septets , with or without wind-instrunrcnts , - where there is no piano , it is implicitly agreed that the first violin takes the lead ; it gives the signrd of attack , it indicates the combination shadings , the rullentandos , the organ-points , finally it comrna7Uls , and this suits it , because there must always be a leader , and it is well fitted for this part . But if lie piano takes a part , the first violin , while preserving the attitude of command habitual to it , finds itself forced to take into account this new partner whose force of will is un equalled ; it is the latter now that imposes its time and its shading , and this without effort , by the sole fact that it is irresistible , representing an orchestra in itself , with which , moreover , it can maintain a struggle , as happens in Concertos . If each instru- ' ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the piano is a whole army corps . But I am wrong to male use of such comparisons , since we can find better ones without going outside of MUSICAL EDUCATION the musical donntin . EverN-body has heard Ilunga-rian orchestras with their keen and strident ccmbalo , that ancestor of the pMno , Miich gives to them such an individual character of prcrision , ( - lctruess and ncr-vous force ; here , as elscwhere , it is the first violin , the only one that is played ShIllding , that directs the band and plays the part of the conductor ; all the others obey it , following it with most : untising facility into the rhythmic by-ways that give to Hungarian music so strange and so typical a character , : dl follow , even the ccobalo ; but if the latter look : t fancy to rob the leader of its authority and nrodif:v the interpretation to its own taste , it would carr.v everything before it , not one would be able to liberate itself ' from the com-municative power of that metallic and perpetual bam-mering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation of : t shepherd who is rot in ac-cord with bis clog . And it would have to give in . This is exactly iihat would happen in Chamber-music if the pianist did not , know how to restrain him-self , make himself flexible and conduct himself far more as a musician than as : t virtuoso , although a great deal of skill is required of hint in order to man-age to subdue this piano , which is really nothing but a kcgcd ccnibalo , * and prevent it from showing its lion 's ( - haws , and asserting its dominating strength . Only very great artists can succeed in maintaining the balance without effacing thetusclvcs in an exaggerated manner and attenuating without annihilating the sound , which would be equally barniful . THE STUDY O INSTRUMENTS An easy experiment ? ? ill clearly demonstrate the materi , d preponderance of the piano in Chambermusic . Get somebody to play , entirely alone , the violin , viola , or violoncello part of any piece of ensemble music whatsoever : you Anil gain no idea of AN-hat the combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also by itself , the piano part of the same piece , and immediately , As ith a very slir ; ht effort of the imagination , you will be able to divine what AN-ill be the general effect by reconstructing approximately , with your mind , the other missing parts . When we reduce the piano to the apparently modest part of accompanist , whether for an instrumental solo or for an operatic aria , it becomes a miniature orclicstra of which the pianist is the conductor . Awkwardly employed , it can overwhelm , annihilate , or totally rout the unhappy soloist , whilst in capable hands , it supports and guides him , brings out his rood points , sliows bim the right road when he strays , and becomes his most precious auxiliary , the artificer of his success . The singer is always at his case when he is accompanied by the composer , because the composer is ali ays an artist before lie is a pianist . More than any other musician , must the accompanist possess presence of mind , sang-froid , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin all , or save all . Ilence the importance that the most accomplished singers attach to having Always a good accompanist , and , as often as possible , their own , accompanist , without whom they feel as if they were deserted and disabled . // I hope now that I have made completely clear the importance of the piano in whatever service it may be employed , and the consequent absolute necessity ( in order intelligently to mauuipnlate so energetic a mechanism , which , in inexperienced hands can so easily become a disturber ) of possessing sound knowledge of technique and ast.hei ics . At a period when thousands of young pianists possess an inconceivable finger dexterity , it is not uninteresting to remind them of the true mission of the simple and the beautiful , tbal of charming and not of astounding the audience , of playliig less for show and more for the heart . Tlds secret , which reveals the true artist , can only be burned by the study of the great masters , aided by hearing , as often as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestige of execution possess a hir ; li intelligence in matters of art . It is also necc. " a y to know how to listen attentively to good singers , for they can often serve as models , if not counsellors . " One can learn much from singers , but it , will not do to accept all their counsels , " says Sclnunann . The great fault of the piano , a fault inherent , to its nature , is dryness ; it can not sustain the tone , and if any one ever succeeds in giving this faculty to it , as has several times been attempted already , it will be the piano no longer , but a new instrument . It is then for the pianist , by the force of his art , to lessen and make this characteristic imperfection forgotten , by trying to imitate the vocal inflections of singers ; this is why he should listen to them attentively , study and assimilate their 114 TIDE S'T'UDY OF INSTRUMENTS methods , and try to imitate them or come as near it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persons who occupy themselves seriously with the piano is to learn , to study and to analyze the beau tiful art of singing . With this end io view , we should never neglect an opportunity of hearing great artists , whatever may be their instrument , and above all the great singers ; from the very beginning and in the first stage of our accomplishment , we should know how to surround ourselves with good models . " For this imitation , a great help to success in pro ducing the illusion of tones that are sustained or swelled , is the judicious use of the pedals . Of these the great majority of amateur pianists , and , what is more to be regretted , a great number of artists do not know how 110 avail themselves . " In the use of pedals , which play so important a part in execu tion , we should take the greatest care never , to mix dissimilar harmonies and thus produce disagreeable dissonances . There are pianists - , s ? ho make such an abuse of the pedals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that their sense of hearing is perverted and they have lost the appreciation of pure har mony . " Now , who is it that expresses himself thus ? It is still Thalberg , that is to say the man who , with Chopin , carried to the utmost limit of ability the art of using the pedals . " The greatest number of pupils , " the learned master , 1Tarmontel , also remarks upon this subject , " to whom the use of the loud pedal is permitted , make use of it to beat the time " MUSICAL EDUCATION ( we have already mentioned one frequent cause of this grotesque use ) ? " or , better , put it down and never let it go . This produces a frightful cacophony , to the affliction of all musicians of taste . " It would be better to abstain entirely from using the pedal rather than employ it at random ; and in truth , in all classic music before the Beethoven pe riod , it should be left alone . Iii modern music , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to learn how to make it serve you and never allow it to produce confusion and discord : " The art of the pedal does not consist in knowing how to put it down , but how to take it off . " j This is indeed a truth , the importance of which too fcw pianists compre licnd . It is certain that the study of harmony contributes to uproot these habits , as vicious as they are anti-artistic . Formerly , and not so very long ago either , it was the custom to play a prelude on the piano . It even happened , as exaggeration followed , that under the pretext of preludes some performers thus improvised veritable pieces that never finished . This might be charming when the pianist was also a clever im proviser ; but , as this was the exception , more often people found themselves treated to lacubrations of a moment , containing more nonsense and rambling than anything else . To obviate this regrettable condition , some naive THIS STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS and well-intentioned professors had the idea of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the major and tnimor keys , some kinds of formnla as hideous as they were pretentious , which the performer was to learn by heart and then be credited with improvising . It was grotesque . Another annoying thing about it was that these formula- having to serve for every piece written in the same key , if there were several on the same programme , no matte what inspired air might be selected , the ridiculous trick was discovered . A sudden change in fashion occurred , for fashion meddles with everything , and now preludes are out of date , which , after all , is much better . There are three cases , however , in which it is still necessary to know how to improvise a few chords : The first always presents itself in chamber-music , immediately after having given the A and just before beginning the piece . The A is always needed for the instruments to tune by . If , after the horrible cacophony which is the result of this ceremony and which no one has yet found the means to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece in E-flat , for instance , the result for the sensitive hearer would be an impression of discord , very fleeting certainly , but nevertheless painful . Therefore , it is better to prepare him for the tonality by a few discreet chords that will efface from his memory the unavoidable charivari of the tuning of the instruments . Second case : if one should have to play in sue-I MUSICAL EDUCATION cession several pieces in very different and dissimilar keys ( a thing it would be better to avoid in making up the programme ) , it is judicious to weld there together , or to separate them , by a rapid modulation which will prevent the memory of the first piece from spoiling the beginning of the second . ( ' Phis will be a little less of a shock . ) Third case : to give the key to a singer whom we are accompanying , especially if he has to begin with the first bar . Reduced to its most simple expression , a few chords or a few arpeggi , the prelude c.ui still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sonority , resonance or deadness , of a hall , or of an iustnmwiit with which we are not yet familiar , and also to command silence and hush disturbing conversation . In all these circmnstanccs , no maitcr how brief may be the series of improvised chords , in order that they should be correct and not displeasing , and in order to avoid any clashing or awkwardness , the pianist must be versed in the practice of harmony to a greater degree than any of his associates who play on other instruments , and who have never , or but very rarely , to manage combined notes . Everything that tends to develop the musical spirit and the initiative sense is good for him : to sing in choruses , serving in them as a leader in the attack , and if he has no voice , to act as accompanist , rehearse the singers , read the score , make transcriptions , and , in short , serve in every capacity as a real musician . I should like to sum up all this in a formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is true : The pianist who is nothing but a good pianist is a bad pianist . If I have thought it necessary to give so ' nuch space to everything concerning the piano , it is not merely because this instrument is the one most usually found in our drawing-rooms . It is more particularly because of the preponderant part that it plays in the musical civilization of our time . The celebrated Russian pianist and composer , A. Rubinstein , did not hesitate to assert his convictions upon this subject : " Instrumental music , " lie said , " is man 's most intimate friend , closer than his parents , his sisters , or his comrades " ( ? ) " This is particularly shown in misfortune ; and of all instru ments the one that best plays the part of a friend is the piano . Therefore , I consider the teaching of the piano as a great benefit to humanity and I am not very far from making it obligatory " ( this is per haps somewhat excessive ) ? " regarding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pupil and not as a means of shining in society . " Did Rubinstein know this thought of Chateau briand 's , which he seems to have tried to paraphrase : " Music puts grief to sleep in troubled hearts " ? The piano is everybody 's instrument : as has been already established , a knowledge of it is useful , in diverse degrees and for different reasons , to every in strumentalist , without exception ; it is indispensable to singers and teachers of singing ; moreover , the MUSICAL EDUCATION piano for other reasons is of extreme usefulness for the composer , as we shall see later . Often , too , it is by means of the piano , which in some measure sets a score before your eyes and beneath your fingers , that you become a composer . Witness the great number of worthy composers who commenced to express them-selves as simple pianists . ( I think it . superfluous to add here that every pianist who intends to devote himself to composition , even if solely for his own in strument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cial studies for a composer , and not give himself up blindly to his instinct and the routine fascination ex ercised by the keyboard . ) It is the sole instrument upon which we can condense a score , the only one which in every case is sufficient unto itself , without the aid of any other . From the beginning to the end of the modern studies , and during the entire life of the artist , its indispensableness is perpetually making itself felt for everybody ; and certainly of all instru ments it is the one that plays the greatest part in the diffusion and the expansion of the art . If it is correct to say that solfeggio has always been and will always be , under one form or another , the solid basis of all deep musical instruction , we may also say that the piano is its most convenient and practical pivot , the one around which everything re- volves and upon which all branches of teaching are grafted . It is the instrument par excellence of every musician . Everything therefore pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this so much 120 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS the more because all that we have said on this subject , addressing pianists in particular , besides its direct utility for them , can also , with a few slight modifications , be made use of in the study of every other instrument . THE HARMONIUM If we know how to play the piano , the study of the Harmonium is almost child 's play ; if not , we must begin by learning the piano . In reality , a very well-trained , supple , and , above all , precise technique is the first indispensable requirement , and it is not upon the harmonium that it can be acquired . Apart from the fact that it would be insupportable , it would be entirely insufficient , the keys of that instrument not offering the necessary resistance for this finger gymnastics . Next , it remains for us to learn and understand the functions of this instrument , with its various registers , corresponding at once to various timbres and different octaves ; then the management of the bellows ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of double expression , the most perfect instrument of this type ) , on which depend the modifications of sonority and shadings , which caused it to be called at first : orgue-expressi f . All this is a matter of a few lessons at most and a few weeks of attention , with very little daily or intermittent study , which , in this case , is of little importance . We often see pianists teaching themselves this instrument without any text-book and 9 121 MUSICAL EDUCATION without the help of any teacher , and thus learning to make very good use of it ; but if we want to go so far as to get from it all the delicate effects of sonority of which it is capable and play it like a true virtuoso , a longer period of study is necessary , which varies according to the instinct and the delicacy of touch of each player . The study of the harmonium may be a good approach to that of the Grand Organ . V. The : ORGAN We shall speak here only of the G RA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expression may seem strange to those who are ignorant that its study may be considered from another point of view : I owe them an explanation . The use of the Great Organ in the Roman Catholic Church demands an organist of three complete and distinct kinds of knowledge : that of the instrument itself and its management ; that of improvisation ; and that of the liturgy ; and very frequently it is this combination of attainments that is understood by the study of the organ ; studies of the Roman Catholic Organist would be better . The Roman liturgy has no place in this book ; of improvisation , we shall have a few words to say later when speaking of composition ; only the study of the practice of the instrument considered by itself can find a place in the present chapter . This having been explained , let us begin by estab- TIII ; STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS lishing the great difference between the study of the organ and that of all oilier instruments , for the reason that there do not exist two organs that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano , we know how to play all pianos ; a violin may be good or bad , but it resembles all other violins ; while is hat is called an organ varies infinitely : according to cir-cumstances , among which are : 1st , the suns of money spent in building it ; 2d : the place that is to be given to it ; 3d : the dimensions and the acoustic qual-ities of the building which it is called upon to fill with its waves of sound ; 4th : the kind of ' service that is required of it ( the simple accompaniment of sing-ing or the execution of organ pieces ) ; 5th : the skil-fulness or simply the fancy of the manufacturer ; 6th : , etc. , etc . From all of which it may result that the instrument represents the volume of a large upright piano , or attain the importance of a house of four stories . An organ may have a single stop and a single row of pipes , and it is already an organ ; it may have two stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two hundred stops ; it may have one , two , three , four or five manuals ; it may have pedals or not , and it is still an organ . Its stops may be dis-tributed in a thousand different ways among its various manuals and be controlled or not by combi-nation pedals or other mechanism ; it may have been made for many centuries or according to the modern principles of modern construction , it may be of the most naive simplicity or of an inextricable complica-tion , and worked by electricity from a distance ; and 123 MUSICAL EDUCATION it is neither more nor less than an organ . The master-maker of organs , or organ-maker , who is himself a great artist , and should possess a great knowledge , in acoustics as well as mechanics , never makes two instruments exactly alike . The most colossal organ in the world , to my knowledge , is that of the Town Hail in Sydney , Aie tralia , made by the house of W. Hill &; Son , of London , which contains 127 stops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pedal board and 28 combination pedals , and cost the trifling suns of $90,000 ( 450 , - 000 francs ) . So the question here is not to learn to play any determined instrument , but to learn how to make use of any organ whatsoever , whether we are taken unawares , or have several days to become acquainted with it . This last condition naturally is so much the more strongly imposed the more important and complicated an organ is , and no organist , however learned and experienced he may be , would be capable of obtaining , without preliminary practice , exactly all the desired effects of sonority from the organ at Riga ( Russia ) , which has 124 stops , or that of Notre Dame at Paris , which has 110 , or that of St. Sulpice , which numbers 118 . But , let us say also , such instruments are rare and splendid exceptions , and only artists of the first order can be called upon to put them into play . On the other hand , every organist should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary dimensions , with 30 or 40 stops distributed among two or three manuals , such as are found pretty nearly everywhere . 124 . THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS To acquire this faculty , to become capable of making a convenient use of any instrument whatever ( which we assume , be it understood , to be in good condition ) , two things are necessary : first , w e must study in books the construction of the organ , ancient as well as modern , so as to understand the use and function of each of its parts ; and frequent the shops of the manufacturers of the Grand Organ so that we may see them close at hand and attentively examine the instruments that are being constructed or repaired , taken to pieces bit by bit , as also try them and make their ( livers combinations work when they have been reconstructed . Organ builders are always very obliging and helpful to young organists who express a desire to inform themselves iii matters of manufacture , knowing well that it is the most certain way for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so varied an instrument . The second thing , when once the function of each piece of machinery is learned , is to frequent the society of organists , and obtain permission from them to listen close beside them , so as to watch them play and examine the way in which they make use of the resources of their instrument , to which they are accustomed and the qualities and defects of which they consequently know . As far as possible , we must not limit ourselves to the study of a single organist in this way , but extend this study to several , in order to make comparisons between them and their methods as well as between their various instruments . It is not until we feel well equipped with all these 125 MUSICAL EDUCATION observations and are conscious that we know what a Grand Organ really is , that it is time to take lessons and place our hands upon the keyboard . Those who proceed differently will find their progress retarded , because they do not fully comprehend what they are doing and what they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of the instrument , upon which I insist , must not be regarded as isolated and peculiar to the organ . Every instrumentalist understands the function of his instrument without having to make a special study of it : the violinist has no need to have anyone explain that the rubbing of the bow produces the tones , and that the intonation is changed by shortening the vibrating portion of the strings by means of the fingers of his left hand , all this happens under his eyes ; the flutist is not long in grasping the mechanism of his flute , the utility of the keys , and the stops that he manages with his lingers ; but it is otherwise with the organist. , who is called upon to make intelligent use of an extraordinarily complicated mechanism , all . of which is hidden and shut up from him , with the exception of the controlling parts , the keys of the manuals and the stops of the registers . In order that he may know his instrument in all its complexity , as the others know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary study which is not required from them , ? that is the only difference . Two conditions only are indispensable for undertaking the study of an organ : being sufficiently tall to be able to work the pedals easily , while seated easily 1126 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS on the bench and without having to stand up even for the most distant pedals , and being able to play the piano perfectly . But , some one will object , the organ is much older than the piano ! then how did they learn to play the organ before the piano was invented ? This objection is very just ; however , it would not be formulated by one who had examined , as we have advised above ; the organs of different periods , particularly those anterior to the invention of the piano , that is to say , those that have now been in existence for more than two centuries . In those days , the keys of the organ were almost as hard to manipulate , to manoeuvre would be more correct , as the Carillons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a blow of the fist . A great expenditure of force was required , and the most skilful virtuosi could never have dreamed of the rapidity and velocity which are to-day as easy on the organ as on the piano . The progress of its manufacture has advantageously modified the instrument from beginning to end . I t is absolutely certain that the illustrious John Sebastian Bach , as well as his contemporaries , Buxtehude and Couperin , both celebrated organists of the Seventeenth Century , the one in Denmark and the other iii France , had to execute his fugues and his toccata , perhaps sometimes with regret , in. a movement infinitely slower than is possible to the ordinary organists of to-day , who , let us say in passing , sometimes abuse the suppleness of the modern instrument 's emission of tone and pervert the spirit of , the Old Masters of the organ by de-127 MUSICAL EDUCATION priving it of a part of its nobility and grandeur . A fugue or any piece whatsoever of the time of ' Bach and Handel always gains by being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the organs of their period , and this is the only way in which its character is preserved . But this is a parenthesis . Before the piano existed , there were the CLavecin , the Spinet and the Virginals , and it was upon these ancestors of the piano that the knowledge of the keyboard was acquired . All organists were then skilful clavecinists also . It must also be remembered t hat at that time , when the practice of music was far from being so common as it " is to-day , there ere infinitely fewer musicians than there are at present , that tape amateur was nothing but a simple listener more or less enlightened and initiated in its technique or aesthetics , but he never practiced the art himself , and that The organs as well as the organists and Maitres ( le Chapelle might be counted . When a musician embraced this career , he consecrated his entire life to it ; and from that time it mattered little if the novitiate was long and arduous . Now , things have greatly changed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have its organist ; and many amateurs are ready to assume this office temporarily without any idea of making a career of it , having simply in view the very real and elevated pleasure that every musician experiences at the mere contact of ' the organ manual . So this is the reply to the above objection : Fewer learned ; they learned at the expenditure of more time and labour ; they obtained smaller results . ( 128 THE STUDY OF 1NSTItUMENTS The great and celebrated organists of the past centuries would probably be astounded if they could hear their immortal works executed to-day on one of our perfected instruments by our Guilniants , Widors or Saint-Sacns with a virtuosity , an case , a variety of timbre and a suppleness of expression , which must have been their desideratum , but of which they never could have dreamed , owing to the condition of the organ manufacture in their time . It is not only necessary that the apprentice of the organ should be able to play the piano very well , but he should devote himself especially on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces that have several parts under the hand , such as the etudes of Cramer , Clementi 's Gradus ad Parnassum , the Preludes and Fugues of the Well-Tempered Clavier by John Sebastian Bach , and the fugues of Handel and Mendelssohn , which constitute an excellent apprenticeship for the practice of the organ . In devoting . ourselves to this preparatory study , it is important to take scrupulous care in preserving for each note , and for each voice , its integral value , and iii not lifting the finger too soon or too late , even for the fraction of . a second , using for this purpose what is called substituted fingering , which alone is favourable to conscientious execution , while thoroughly realizing that those infinitesimal defects of precision , that are even imperceptible upon the piano , become monstrous on the organ , where they produce either gaps or discords that are equally painful and intolerable . We can see by this that to play perfectly on the piano is not 129 MUSICAI , EDUCATION sufficient , but that it is necessary to play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the most skilful , take the trouble to do . And for this , it is not necessary for them to neglect the other special pianistic qualities , for everything that makes them adroit and agile upon the piano will also be found useful for the organ . Another kind of agility of quite a special nature , for no other instrument demands it , will have to be acquired , namely , that of the feet and legs ; for the working of the pedals is nothing else than a real keyboard whose keys are very much larger than any others ; and embraces , moreover , in modern organs , a compass of about two octaves and it half . To facilitate this special study , many piano manufacturers make a kind of pedal with strings and hammers that can be placed underneath the piano , thus permitting one to work at home . This is an economy of time and a very great convenience ; if one can not : be procured , it is very necessary to work on an organ . We have only spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intervention of a teacher . The question is to apply to the touch of the organ what we have already learned on the piano , and bringing it to still greater perfection ; to become initiated into the management of the registers and their multiple combinations , resulting in infinite varieties of timbres and sonorous effects of incalculable number ; to acquire the particularly pure and elevated style that befits the King of Instruments , and finally to become worthy of the title of organist , which may 130 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS be considered as a title of nobility for every musician . I fear I may insult the reader by adding here that if a knowledge of the laws of harmony is indispensable to the pianist , it is ten times more so to the organist , who would do well , moreover , to add a few notions of counterpoint if he wishes to penetrate deeply into the spirit of the most authoritative works of his repertory . At every period of life , if it man has remained agile and adroit in the use of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harmonist , and if to these acquired qualities is added the natural one of having rather large hands , there is nothing to prevent him from becoming a good organist . The amount of daily work need scarcely exceed three or four hours ; more would be useless and fatiguing . A certain maturity of mind is expedient for this great and beautiful study , which , nevertheless , may be commenced at the age of fifteen or sixteen years , if the required conditions are fulfilled . It goes without saying that if the end sought is merely the accompanying of hymns upon a very simple organ , the studies can be greatly curtailed . If , on the contrary , it is a question of ' playing the Grand Organ in a Catholic church , the studies of Fugue , Composition , Improvisation , Plain-Song and Liturgy must be added , as we have said above , and it then becomes a very complex science . 131 MUSICAL EDUCATION VI . THE STRINGS : VIOLIN , VIOLA , VIOLONCELLO AND DOUBLE-Bass To understand thoroughly the difficulty attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their action must be taken into account ; for it is as complicated in reality as it is simple in appear. - ance . In this each hand has an absolutely distinct employment , which is not the case in ny other class of instruments . The left hand supports the instrument ; and , at the same time , by the pressure of its fingers upon the strings , the vibrations of which it shortens ( or cuts off into sections for harmonic notes ) , it determines the absolute pitch of the tones ; it is then upon the left hand alone that accuracy depends , and we can form an idea of the precision that it must acquire , when we realize that placing the finger a tenth of a millimetre ( .03937 inch ) out , and sometimes even less in the highest treble , will produce a note off the pitch . This is not in the least an exaggeration , and explains why artists who play with rigorously pure intonation are so rare ; moreover , this pressure has to be made with a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the stringed instruments are very often called upon to furnish passages of extreme rapidity , a very great agility is indispensable to it in addition . The qualities required of the left hand therefore are strength , precision , cleverness and agility . 132 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS The right hand holds the bow : upon it principally depends all that belongs to expression , the greater or less intensity of the tones , the most energetic as Well as the most tender , or most passionate nuances , the most subtle inflections or accents , as delicate as and even more varied than those of the human voice , brilliancy and clash , heat , warmth and breadth ; it also assists largely in the rapid action . " The instruments of the bow , particularly the vio lin and the violoncello , are not limited , as are the wind instruments , to a small number of sound-char acteristics ; their timbre has an infinite variety of shadings , " according as the point , the middle or the nut of the bow is used , according as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side , according as the string is attacked near the bridge or the fingerboard , even over the fingerboard , according to the various kinds of bowing , whether up or down , the principal of which in French are called by the following names : lie or coule , the grand detachc , the dctache sec , or martele , the sautille , the jete , the staccato , etc . The use of the bow is a whole art by itself . We must therefore demand of the right hand incompar able suppleness , accompanied by extreme lightness and the greatest vigour . The two hands , each on its own account and by dif ferent means , join in producing beauty and variety of tone , that constant preoccupation of every virt uoso . Their perfect agreement produces the bal ance of the whole and the perfection of the execution , MUSICAL EDUCATION the difficulty of which is so great that no one would dare to attempt it , as it seems almost unattainable when we analyze it closely , unless he had as an encouraging example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanquish it by obstinate labour . This execution is also very soon aided by a peculiar instinct , thanks to which the pupil is no longer conscious of the prodigies of skill that he performs every moment . Contrary to the keyboard instruments , the rodigiously complicated mechanism of which is the ork of the manufacturer , stringed instruments possess absolutely none : a wooden box , four strings of sheep 's entrails and a few strands of horsehair , ? this is all that the artist holds in his hands to produce the most varied emotions . If the result obtained he compared with the simplicity of the means employed , it will be acknowledged that it is amazing and phenomenal ; nothing is truer , however , and this total absence of mechanical transmission , which leaves man 's hand in direct and intimate contact with the vibrating string , is exactly what produces that impression of vitality and penetrating warmth which is the chief characteristic of these instruments and constitutes their remarkable beauty . The man and the instrument grow to be but one individual , or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the natural organs , that we come so to identify it with ourselves , that we set it in action , like the other organs , under the simple influence of our will only , without further troubling about the means employed , and 134 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS without even dreaming of analyzing them . This becomes instinctive , as a new vital function would be ; we play as naturally as we should sing , and it is by this sign , this complete oblivion of all preoccupations of a material order , that the artist : can most surely recognize that he has at last become the master of his instrument . Up to this point , he is nothing but a simple apprentice . Outside of his studies , that are far more engaging than arduous , the normal programme of which we are about to outline , it is also well for the pupil to accustom himself early , not only to tune his instrument , but to clean it and keep it in good condition , and himself to make certain little ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as replacing secundum artem , a broken string , setting up in its exact place the bridge that has been accidentally moved , and assuring the good working of the pegs , matters which do not call for the intervention of the violin-repairer , and which one learns to do much better for oneself and more in accordance with one 's own ideas . Later , he should teach himself to recognize and appreciate the artistic , if not the commercial , value of a good instrument , to distinguish the schools and great violin-makers otherwise than by the label , very often fallacious , lying at the bottom of the sound-box ; to distinguish an old instrument from a clever imitation , in fact , to act as an expert , if only for his own profit , so that he shall not be duped on that day , when , as the reward for his labours , he wants to make himself a 135 MUSICAL EDUCATION present of a valuable instrument , a battle-horse , the supreme and legitimate desideratum of every great artist . THIS V1OLIN The VIOLIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play very well . At first , the study is ungrateful and irritating to the nerves ; but this does not last very long ; and the learner soon gains a little power ; it is when he attempts to go beyond this and attain real virtuosity that courageous and persistent efforts , entailing a fatigue that may sometimes become almost painful , are ( Alen necessary . Therefore , it is well to begin young , and very soon , to get rid of those irritating difficulties of an elementary nature that are far more painful to face when one is of an age to suffer from their aridity . Taking the average opinion of a number of the most experienced professors , it would seem that the most favourable age to begin is from six to eight years . However , it is not well to hurry too much , for , on the one hand , a certain strength is needed , and on the other , it might be hurtful to the physical development ; the pose of a violinist , which is not absolutely natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain effort till he has become completely accustomed to it . Now , this position is of capital importance , and the good attitude of a violinist has an influence upon his playing , his tone and his agility , to a degree unknown to any other instrumentalist . We can venture to judge of the worth of a violinist before 136 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS he has played a single note , by merely seeing the manner in which he plants his feet and holds his violin ; therefore the best professors are those , who , from the very beginning , pay most attention to giving their young pupils a perfectly correct position , which for a long time will be the object of their care . Some of them advise practising before a mirror , which is also done by singers who want to get rid of the habit of making grimaces ; this is not a bad idea . Therefore , on account of this somewhat- forced position , to begin too early , before the growth is sufficiently advanced , particularly with young girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it would be prudent to watch . This is the sole danger of premature study , for the fear that some people have that the vibration of the strings is communicated to the chest and causes trouble is pure illusion . At ten years of age , it is a little late to begin ; at eighteen , it is too late if you want to acquire the talent of a virtuoso ; but even then , with strong will , you can become an orchestra-player , a useful second violin , if you are already a good musician . No condition of conformation is rigorously requisite provided that the arms and hands are in good condition ; however , a large left hand with a long little finger will greatly facilitate niatters . The first quality to obtain from the violin is pure intonation ; this necessitates a delicate and already trained ear . Solfeggio , therefore , should precede and accompany the study of the violin . But if the ear is not true , if it does not perceive with precision the // MUSICAL EDUCATION slightest differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violin up at once , for this can rarely be cor-rected , and if one is absolutely determined to study music , fall back upon some instrument with keys or a keyboard , one of those that produce an intonation ready made . If on the contrary , the lack of good in-tonation is occasioned simply by the awkwardness of the left hand , and if the pupil himself notices that he plays out of tune , above all if this is disagreeable to him , nothing is being lost , the study will be justified . It is always an advantage for very young pupils to begin with a violin of small dimensions , a half , or three-quarters , according to their stature ; this will cause less fatigue to the left hand . They can after-wards pass to a violin of ordinary dimensions without serious difficulty ; and they accustom themselves very quickly to a greater stretching of the fingers , and re-cover accuracy very easily . Another very important study is that of the quality of tone , which depends principally upon the bow , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the strings ; a rough or harsh tone , or a tone that is feeble or shrill is equally faulty . You must play the bow on the string , a very accurate expres-sion , the importance of which can only be appreciated by one who has managed a stringed instrument . " Each string of the violin has an entirely distinct tone colour . The chanterelle ( first string ) has accents that are vibrant and warm , which lend to the melodic phrase all the intensity of expression of which it is susceptible . The very piercing notes of the chante-U88 TIIE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS relle , placed in a region to which the human organ can-not attain , give a luminous sensation and awaken the idea of the supernatural and the marvellous . The second string is not so biting as the titanterelle : it excels in interpreting melodies that are ideal and suave . The third string is distinguished by an incompar able sweetness . The fourth string is a Contralto voice , with a mas culine and powerful timbre . " This may guide us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to each individual string . It goes without saying that the quality of tone depends also , in great part , upon the perfection of the instru ment , and that we can not obtain the same richness of timbre from a violin that costs 20 francs as from a Stradivarius ; but in the hands of an awkward pupil the two instruments will not present much difference , whilst the pupil and the professor , or even two pupils playing alternately one and the other of the two in struments , will produce tones that have not the slight est resemblance . It is therefore absolutely useless , so far as the ele mentary studies are concerned , to place in the hands of a pupil an instrument of value of which he can make no use ; and this so much the more on account of a most mysterious phenomenon , conceded without question , a violin deteriorates and loses part of its qualities when it is badly played . Inversely , it im proves under skilful hands . MUSICAL EDUCATION Besides the qualities of good intonation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is still more difficult and takes longer to acquire , and that is the flexibility of the bow , upon which defends the supreme elegance , the spirit , and the variety of subtle shading , as also the distinction so necessary to an instrument that has to serve the most varied and sometimes the commonest uses ; for the violin of the fiddler , the village violinist , is the same as that of Paganini . How do they differ ? By the manner of playing them , the timbre and the boldness of the strokes of the bow . This study of the bow is , so to speak , a perpetual study by every violinist who has already arrived at perfection . Long after he has vanquished difficulties of all kinds , and attained impeccable accuracy , purity and richness , he still studies and will always study the infinite varieties of ' bowing , with its innumerable combinations , inventing new ones , and trying to apply them , and will find in this study , which is to him what breathing and vocal inflections are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On no account should the study of the violin occupy more than six hours a day . Four hours will suffice perfectly , even during the finishing studies of pupils who are really well endowed . During the first years , it would be wise not to work more than two hours a day , and even less during the first months . Just as in the case of the piano , numerous inventors have employed their ingenuity in inventing apparatus of various kinds to facilitate the study of the 140 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS violin : there are some to indicate the place on the finger-board for the fingers of the left hand , and which thus pretend to teach how to play in tune ; there are some that are made to force one to draw and push the bow across the strings exactly at right angles ; there are some to force the right hand to hold itself in the most correct manner ; there are some to force the instrument to be held in the proper position ; there are many others , infinitely more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a violinist to point out a single one that he considered of the slight est advantage ; from which I conclude that they are all useless and infantile , good only for simpletons . THE VIOLA Every violinist who would like to play the VIOLA can learn it very easily in a few mouths , without any need of a professor . He has the same experience as that of the child who has begun on a little instru ment , and afterwards takes up a violin of the normal size ; lie has to accustom himself to a greater stretch ing of the fingers . For , as far as its handling is con cerned , it is simply a very much larger violin ; and the use of the bow , although demanding a little more strength , is practically the same . The viola does not offer that marvellous variety of timbres which has made the violin the universal in terpreter of sentiment . We must not ask of it " the brilliant and passionate note ; placed within the con-fines of the male and female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mixed character . Its veiled sonority , of an elegiac melancholy , is suited to everything ex pressive of suffering , sadness , and depressed feeling . " However , we can obtain tonal shadings of cap tivating effect : " The two highest strings have a pene trating vibration approaching harshness . On the two lower strings the timbre of the viola assumes a sombre and austere colour sometimes verging on the sinister . " Such are the various effects that we may seek in studying this beautiful instrument , being sure of find ing use for it in the practice of chamber-music as well as in the modern orchestra , where it plays an im portant part . To play the viola , it is well to have quite a solid physique , for the instrument is much more fatiguing than the violin . For the same reason , it is necessary to wait until the growth is developed , till about fifteen years of age , and up to that time to study the violin exclusively . Then , it is excellent to carry the two studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this will give rapidity and virtuosity , and the two instruments complement one another without the slightest harm to either : Paganini , Vieuxtemps , Sivori , Alard , etc. , were admirable viola-players . Four hours of daily study are amply sufficient . 142 TIII ; STUDY OF INSTRUJMENTS THE VIoI.oNcELI , o What we have said of the violin may in a great measure apply to the VIOLONCELLO . The conformation of the left hand , strong and large , with the fifth finger rather long , assumes here more considerable importance , because of the dimensions of the instrument . To have both arms normally formed , and the car correct , or capable of becoming so , are indispensable . The age that appears most convenient for beginning varies between six and twelve years , but a beginning may be made later , as long as the lack of flexibility is not in opposition to the exigencies of the position , particularly with regard to the bow . It is an advantage for the child to practice on a little violoncello proportionate to his size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attains his growth ; finally , the time of daily study depends solely upon the individual endurance ; and , consequently , can not be regulated absolutely ; so long as the work is intelligent and not mechanical , it is profitable . The position and the general attitude of the body are of great importance with the violoncello , as with the violin . It acts at the same time upon the quality of tone and the rapidity of the playing ; but it is less constrained , particularly since the custom of adding a peg to the instrument , which supports a part of its weight . On this account , there is a possibility of slightly prolonging the hours of study , the fatigue being , in reality , a little less considerable . 143 MUSICAL EDUCATION Besides this , the peg , which is not yet used by all artists , I do not know why , offers an advantage of a particular character for the women who want to study this instrument . Before its adoption , the violoncello had to be held by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrained to a rather ungraceful position , almost a contortion ; moreover , the forced contact of the skirts to a certain extent spoiled the vibrations of the sound cavity . With the peg , these two inconveniences have disappeared ; and the violoncello , held as represented in certain portraits of St. Cecilia , has become infinitely more accessible to women and young girls than formerly . This is how the learned musician Gevaert , in the work from which we have quoted several times , defines the qualities that constitute the beauty of timbre of the strings of the violoncello , and to which consequently the attention of the student of the violoncello should be directed : " Of all the instruments that are qualified to interpret a melodic idea , not one possesses the accents of the human voice in the same degree as the violoncello : not one reaches the deepest fibres of the heart so surely . In variety of timbres , it yields nothing to the violin . It unites in itself the characters of the three male voices : the youthfulness of the tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bass . It:s vibrant chanterellc is called upon to translate the effusions of exalted sentiment : regrets , sorrows and the ecstasy of love . The second and third strings have an unctuous and insinuating sonority that expresses more restrained feelings ; the 144 TILE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS fourth string is fitted only for songs of a sombre and mysterious character . " But apart from its singing , it finds a use as the bass of the String-Quartet , where its power and roundness give it a particular importance . By reason of its compass and its several registers , the violoncello is the only instrument that demands the knowledge of three clefs : the treble , tenor and bass ( G , C in alt . and F ) . Tn E Doi7BLs-Brass To play the DOUBLE-BASS , it is better to be big and strong , and to have robust hands and fingers that will stretch easily . However , there are double-bass players of medium height who prove that the choice of their large instrument was justified ; but it is bet-ter not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comical disproportion ; that would truly be embar rassing . Before the age of sixteen , it is greatly to be feared that one has not yet the necessary strength for this instrument ; after twenty or twenty-two years , flex ibility would be lacking , and a great deal more of this is required than might appear . It is therefore between these two limits that it is right to take up the study of this instrument , as indispensable as un grateful , for it never elicits applause , although it 1IUSICAL EDUJCATION contributes an incomparable power to the whole effect , as much by its energetic timbre as by its depth . Its motto might be : Sic ' cos non vobis . Its study is almost entirely material , and it is per haps the sole instrument that never has to furnish style or amiability . " The tones of its strings do not present many well defined differences . Like all instru ments whose compass is beyond the limits of the hu man voice , the double-bass is powerless to recall its accents . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the song of the violoncello. " * It is a part that is relatively kept in the background , and yet it is of extreme importance in the orchestral en semble . Its qualities are strength , solidity and ac-curacy , and sometimes a certain relative speed , and that is all . Thus it can be learned rather quickly with three or four hours of conscientious work a day . VII . ' I 'RE IlAizr Formerly very numerous , the family of instruments of plucked strings is to-day reduced exclusively to one individual , the HAnr , which was formerly , even during the best period and even while it was still very imperfect , its most beautiful representative . It shares with the organ and piano the faculty of being sufficient in itself and requiring no accompaniment ; it is an autonomous instrument , that is to say , it fur nishes both the melody and harmony . As a singing instrument , however , it is certain that it leaves much THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS to be desired , for it is incapable of sustaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its nature , by the beauty and richness of its timbre , by the distinction of its sonority and its capacity for producing certain passages that are peculiar to it ; moreover , it combines admirably with nearly every instrument , which makes as valuable in the theatre and concert as in church , and multiplies its uses . The age that seems the most suitable for beginning the study of the IIAll is somewhere about eight years ; a little sooner offers no great objections from the physiological point of view , if these three conditions exist : 1. - That the child be rather tall for his age and well constituted . 2. - That the study be directed by some one who is very competent and experienced . 3. - That a harp for study can be found that is small and light enough to be handled without muscular fatigue . On the contrary , to begin too laic , that is to say when the joints are no longer sufficiently supple , would prevent the pupil from ever attaining a complete mechanical development . However , an adult of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly if he has already studied some other instrument , can still become a good harpist . No special condition of conformation is particularly demanded for the study of the harp , unless it is a very delicate ear ; the harpist must be constantly tuning and retuning his harp ; this is a necessity ; 147 MUSICAL EDUCATION nevertheless , rather long arms and tips of fingers that should be fleshy rather than lean and bony , are certainly desirable . The second phalanx of the thumb should also be examined ; if it is too supple and curves backwards , it may cause some embarrass ment . On the other hand , it is certain that any de formity whatsoever would be an absolute defect , first because of the inconvenience , and then because the harp , on account of its elegant form and the essen tially graceful pose of the player , attracts and holds the eyes of the hearer more than any other instru ment . We can sec this at it concert as well as at the theatre ; from the moment the harp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A painful or ridiculous impression would therefore result from any deformity the player . The normal time to devote every clay to this study is several separate quarters of an hour at first ; then two hours , four hours , and , in exceptional cases , six ; more would be excessive . " All the exercises should be practised very slowly ; the pupil must watch particularly the articulation of the phalanx ; he must exact great suppleness , and im mediately stop the study when the muscles of the hand stiffer from the slightest stiffness or numbness. " * No matter what the intelligence of the pupil may be , it would be an illusion to believe that he can dis pense with a teacher , at least during the first months , and as long as the position of the body as well as the hands is not perfectly assured . He mould inTIHE STUDY ( ' ; F INSTRUMENTS evitably fall into bad habits that would be particularly harmful to the beauty of his tone as well as to the development of his agility . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already a good musician , he can try to do without a master and prosecute his studies alone , but only upon the condition , however , that lie does not aim at acquiring transcendent virtuosity and limits his ambition to a mediocre talent . Otherwise , direction is indispensable . And , in this case , it may be remarked that the frequency of the lessons , lessons at short intervals , are of more importance for the harp than for the majority of instruments , which is explained by these two facts , that one contracts defective habits in a few days and that the study of the harp , considered as a whole , is relatively brief , only a few years . The harp is one of the most inconvenient instruments for reading at sight ; first , on account of its form , which does not allow the executant to get as near the desk as his eyesight demands and place himself in the most favourable position ; and finally , and more especially , because upon this instrument , and upon it alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obtained by moving the pedals , which are seven in number , and these have to be moved before the string is attacked . The harpist , therefore , more than any one else , is obliged to attach the greatest importance to this study , and also , more than any one else , never to undertake playing any piece without first having read it over from beginning to end , so that he may anticipate the modulations as well as the acci 149 MUSICAL EDUCATION dentals of a chromatic nature , and avoid as far as possible any surprise . From this reason also arises the necessity of knowing how to read in advance , as well as of possessing that special memory of the eyes ( see page 99 ) , which might be called instantaneous memory , and which permits us to embrace several bars with a single glance without thereby losing the precise memory of what we are playing . For this reason , also , a knowledge of the laws of harmony , which often permits a reader to divine what he has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By its very nature , by its facility in executing arpeggios , which owe their name to it , as well as by the short duration of its vibrations , which are much shorter than those of the piano , the harp is essentially an instrument for accompaniments ; and for a long time it was exclusively employed as such , and correctly enough ; for it is truly in this role that it is in its best place . Nevertheless , aided by the progress of virtuosity and the manufacturer , one can , by means of art and address , succeed in producing a certain illusion of song , particularly in the soli and in the absence of every instrument that really has a singing quality , in comparison with which it would suffer . The middle strings are the ones that lend themselves best to this effect , which demands a well trained touch , at once powerful and supple . Before the invasion of the piano , and again under the First Empire , the harp , although infinitely less 150 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS perfected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the female sex , who , after having abandoned it for a long time , have seemed for several years past to be returning to it . It is a fact that of all instruments , the harp is certainly the one that allows of the most graceful attitude and the most charming movements of the body and arms , the one that most harmoniously combines the pleasure of the ear with that of the eyes . VIII . THE WOOD-WIND : FLUTE , OBOE , 2:TGLISH HORN , , CLARINET AND BASSOON There is less reason for us to enlarge upon WoodWind Instruments , the study of which in fact is easier , except when we wish to attain exceptional virtuosity in them , in which case it offers as much difficulty as any others . By that I mean that given an equal amount of time , effort and aptitude , we more easily succeed in acquiring a fair degree of skill upon a wind-instrument than upon those that compose the String-Quartet . Wind-instruments are generally restricted in compass ; they can produce varieties of intensity only under certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time ; with a few exceptions , with them the emission of tone is slower and less active . For all these reasons , and others besides , among which is the scantiness of their repertory , it happens that the study of them is infinitely more limited . But these same reasons , which simplify and abridge the elementary study , render , as it is easy to understand , the fin 151 MUSICAI . EDUCATION ishing studies much more difficult and laborious , if we wish to rise above mediocrity and attain real excellence . When I say that these studies are not so difficult , it must be understood that only the inferior grades are meant ; perfection in any of them is difficult to acquire . A new factor here comes into play , one with which we have as yet had little to do , this is physical conformation . We have indeed said that it is an advantage for a violinist to have a large hand and for a harpist to have long arms , but . practically everybody , except the one-armed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and short arms are not absolutely prohibitory , constituting simply an extra small difficulty to vanquish . This is no longer the case here , and the requirements relating to the individual 's structure should be very seriously taken into consideration in the choice of an instrument ; for , by despising such precaution , we should expose ourselves to disaster , since nothing , not even the most intelligently directed and most obstinate labour , can conquer the invincible obstacles created by a native imperfection of the respiratory organs , or a disposition of the lips other than that which suits the instrument chosen . This is why , as each instrument is considered , we will state precisely the indispensable physiological conditions to be fulfilled , even at the risk of exposing ourselves to occasional repetitions , which are preferable to omissions . 152 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS THE FLUTE The natural qualifications that are especially fa vourable to the practice of the flute are : rather thin lips , regular teeth , sound lungs and supple and deli cate fingers . The most necessary requirement for playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , a certain arrangement of the lips suitable for putting into the instrument all the breath that comes through the mouth , " * without losing any of it , and that will not allow a kind of hiss that precedes the tone to be heard , a very disagreeable thing which occurs in the playing of all faulty flutists . A slightly projecting upper lip is riot a disadvantage , quite the contrary . The detached notes being made on this instrument by means of an articulation called tonguing , it is indis pensable that the artist should possess great volubility in the organ of speech in order to execute rapid pas-sages with cleanness , and above all , lie must accustom himself to form a perfect agreement between the movements of his tongue and those of his fingers . For a long time , flutes were made out of wood , then of ebony and granadilla wood ; now they are made almost exclusively of silver , which does not pre-vent this instrument from remaining classed with the family of Wood-wind , to which it owes its origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acoustics , and verified by the experience of skilful makers , : that MUSICAL EDUCATION the material of which the tube of wind instruments is formed has no influence , or next to none upon their timbre . Flutes have even been made of crystal and there is nothing to prevent their being made of gold . Of whatever wood or metal the instrument held in the hand may be constructed , the sound that we must try to get out of it remains the same , and the numerous adjectives that writers and poets so frequently use regarding it may guide us in this task . The tone of the flute should be pure , sweet , velvety , suave , silvery , crystalline , limpid and ethereal , otherwise , its very nature is changed and it loses all its charm . Effects that are violent and dramatic are scarcely suited to it ; a nasal , heavy or hollow quality of tone is a great defect . Apart from this question of timbre , the principal qualities to be acquired are rapidity in the execution of passages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the art of skilfully managing the breath . It does not appear advantageous to begin the flute before the age of ten or twelve years ; before that age , it is somewhat difficult to manage the action of the lungs and some fatigue injurious to the health might even be caused . The maximum of work should not exceed four hours a day , here , as always , wisely divided , and considerably reduced during the first months . The riccoto demands no particular study . It is simply an ordinary flute reduced one half in all its proportions , and consequently it produces tones an octave higher ; it requires the same fingering and the 154 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS same embouchure . However , in this case , very fat fingers would be an inconvenience . The qualities of sweetness and suavity that belong to the flute are not to be sought in the piccolo ; the latter should be particularly biting , incisive and strident. ; any excess , a hard and shrill tone , is a fault however . rhIIE OHOl The study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pitfalls for the pupil , and the latter must exercise great perseverance in order to acquire an execution that is clean , and to attain a certain ability . The most considerable difficulty that must first be conquered is the obligation of restraining the breath , so as to soften the tone and to avoid what are commonly called couucs , accidents that occur when the reed only vibrates , without any tone issuing from the instrument . But , in seeking to avoid all accidents of this nature , we must guard against playing with too much gentleness , for then we run the risk of having the instrument emit the tones an octave higher . Just as sweet and velvety , although a little nasal , as the tones of the oboe are when the instrument is in the hands of a clever virtuoso , so are they sharp and shrill when the performer is inexperienced or lacking in the taste that makes true artists . The oboist should aim at obtaining a tone that is delicate without being weak , penetrating without being hard , incisive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand and brutal noise 155 MUSICAL EDUCATION on the other , which are intolerable defects here . The instrument particularly lends itself to the expression of sentiments that are tender or rustic , to emotion and deep melancholy , which does not prevent its occasionally becoming infinitely witty and ironical . But only artists who are absolutely master of their quality of tone can dream of obtaining from their instrument effects that are so varied and so full of charm . To gain this result , it is necessary , not only to be well constituted in everything concerning the chest , a common requirement for the playing of all wind-instruments , but also to have good teeth ( at least the incisors ) , and thin , delicate and firm lips . The double reed of the oboe is formed of two thin layers of reed , of extreme delicacy , and it . is in a great measure by the pressure that the lips exercise upon this fragile organ that are produced all the modifications or inflections of sonority of which the instrument is capable . The sensitiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oboists , anxious about the purity of their timbre , undertake the making of their own reeds , and take the most minute pains with it , which is the only means of adapting them exactly to their individual convenience , although reeds are found in all the shops of the ' makers of wind-instruments . A great number of bassoon-players do the same thing , although their reeds are less delicate . It is therefore easy to understand that in order to set in vibration an organ so fine , so delicate and so sensitive , thick and fleshy lips would constitute if not complete incapacity , 156 THE STUDY OF INSTRUiMENTS at least a great difficulty ; and there are quite enough without this . The daily work should be calculated according to the physique of each individual , and may vary between three and six hours ; but because of the fatigue entailed , it would be dangerous to allow a normally developed child to devote himself to it before he had attained the age of eleven or twelve years . If I underscore the word dangerous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad examples have demonstrated this fact in a fashion , alas ! irremediable . At the age of fifteen , there is still plenty of time to begin , but at eighteen , it would be a little late . Generally speaking , then , let us set the most propitious age approximately at from twelve and fifteen . THE ENGLISH HORN The ENGLIshr IIoRN , being merely an oboe of larger size , slightly bent for facilitating the execution , and producing tones a fifth lower , demands no special study from any one who can play the oboe fairly well ; a little attention and a few weeks of study will suffice for him to acquire the use of this new instrument . Admirable in expressing sentiments of grief and sadness , which it portrays with the most poignant intensity , it does not partake of the oboe 's sportive and humorous side . It is an oboe in mourning . 1571 MUSICAL EDUCATION THE CLARINET The CLARINET may be begun without imprudence at a little earlier age , about ten , if the child is strongly constituted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No serious inconvenience would be incurred by beginning later , so long as the suppleness of the fingers was preserved . The conditions of conformation consist only in having good teeth and lungs . To obtain good results , four hours of regular work a day are necessary . The clarinet , one of the most beautiful voices in the whole orchestra , is the richest in varied timbres of all the wind instruments . It possesses no less than four registers perfectly defined : the chaln mean , which contains the deepest notes and recalls the old rustic instrument of that name ; the medium , warm and expressive ; the sharp , brilliant and energetic ; and the super-sharp , biting and strident at need . Moreover , all these registers , thanks to the progress of manufacture , are able to melt into one another in the happiest manner possible , and furnish a perfectly homogeneous scale . Although possessing a predilection for certain forms of passages that specially belong to it , it accommodates itself to nearly all the vocal and instrumental formulce , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not know how to say here , as I have said with regard to the flute and oboe , what sentiments the clarinet excels in expressing ; it can translate 158 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS nearly all . Almost as agile as the flute , as tender as and more passionate than the oboe , the clarinet is in-finitely more energetic and richer in colour , and for these reasons it offers to the pupil a more engaging and interesting field of study . But it can not be de nied that it is a difficult instrument ; independently of the mechanism , which requires great development , the music written for the clarinet generally contains many rapid passages , and then there is also the question of the embouchure , which can be by no means mastered at the first attempt , and upon this the beauty of tone depends , for the clarinet , like the oboe , is subject to tL. , unlucky couac . In addition to the ordinary clarinet , there are many varieties of the same instrument : alto-clarinet , bass-clarinet , little clarinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master the handling and time embouchure of this type of instrument , it is very easy to become familiar with the use of any of the members , as the tablature is practically the same . Even if one has already become a very good mu sician , it is almost impossible to learn the clarinet alone ; without a master , certain fingerings and special manipulations , which are not indicated'in any method , would always be unknown , and the execution of cer tain passages would be awkward . 159 MUSICAL EDUCATION THE BASSOON An instrument with a double-reed , forming the bass of the oboe as well as that of the entire group of Wood-wind , the BAssooN very seldom appears as a soloist . In revenge , it is of extreme use in the orchestra and in chamber-music written for wind-instruments . The principle for the emission of tone on the bassoon being the same as that for the oboe , it is natural to conclude that the conditions of physical conformation should be the same for each ; always healthy lungs , and teeth in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips is less felt here , the reed being larger and of greater resistance . It is quite soon enough to devote yourself to the bassoon between the ages of sixteen and twenty years , as the chest is not strong enough ( luring the period of growth , and also on account of the weight of the instrument , because work of about five or six hours a day is required in order to accomplish good results ; but understand that you must not wait until this age before acquiring any knowledge of music , and indeed it is very advantageous to have studied some other instrument previously . When all these requirements are fulfilled , it would seem that it is easier for a bassoon-player than any other to do without the help of a teacher ; however , if real ability is required , it will always be infinitely surer to take a certain number of lessons at the beginning and towards the end of the studies . 160 TIE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS Owing to its compass , the bassoon in its notation requires the use of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note here of the contrabassoon , a very rare instrument , and difficult to handle , which , although figuring in quite a large number of scores , is nearly always replaced in actual use , whether at the theatre or concert , by another instrument that is more portable and of a more modern construction ,  --  gen erally a Sarrusophone. * IX . THE BRAS " ' HORN , TRUMPET , CORNET AND TROMBONE All the brass instruments , with the exception of the cornet , present themselves under two types : the sim ple type that emits merely a few tones , though of great beauty ; and the chromatic type , which can sound all the notes contained in its compass , but with a less pure and less characteristic quality of tone . SIMPLE INSTRUMENTS : CHROMATIC INSTRUMENTS : Horn ( ordinary or bar- Valve Horn . mony ) . Trompette a pistons . Trumpet , ordinary . Trombone pistons . Trombone , sliding . One might think that the chromatic instruments , being perfect instruments , capable of playing every note of the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages than the others , in a word , MUSICAL EDUCATION being able to do everything that simple instruments do and many other things besides , one might think , we say , that it would be better to study these alone . However logical this reasoning may seem , it is exactly true only for those who are merely seeking to acquire a very relative talent . Others who want to be able to fill the part of a capable artist under all circumstances ought to possess a knowledge of both kinds of instruments and be able , according to circumstances , to make use of either , which is never a matter of indifference . The chromatic instrument should never be employed except when it is rigorously indispensable , that is to say when the work to be interpreted has been written with its special qualities in view ; in all other music , and particularly that written before the invention of the valve , the simple instruments are always far superior . In fact , the addition of the mechanism of the valve , the real advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamentable effect of depriving every instrument of its individuality , and of giving the various instruments of the brass group too pronounced a family resemblance . It sometimes happens that the listener can not tell if the tone comes from a horn or a trombone , and as it is the variety of timbres that makes the richness of the orchestration , the latter loses a great deal . Therefore we cross the composer 's will and intentions if , as is too often ( lone through laziness or an indifference unworthy of an intelligent interpreter , ' we substitute for the timbre that he requires another that is too nearly related to the neigh-162 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS bouring timbres . This is a breach of fidelity and an error of taste that a conscientious conductor should never tolerate . Another consideration arises from the same fact . Whenever we use chromatic instruments , whether rightly or wrongly , we must try , by dexterity of execution , to minimize their faults of construction , think of the type of the instrument ... Id try to get as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we shall give them their charm and succeed in getting the most out of them . Of all instruments , the brasses are those that suffer the least from a study undertaken at a late date . A robust frame is far more necessary for them than for any others , because of their considerable weight ; and they are also the ones that demand the greatest efforts from the muscles of the chest , and a vigorous and sustained breath ; and it would seem very inappropriate to place such cumbersome and fatiguing tools in the hands of children . However , everybody has not always thought thus : the celebrated maker Adolphe Sax , to whom we are indebted for the invention of the Saxophones , Saxhorns , Sax-tubas , Sax-trombas and other sonorous machines , held the contrary opinion ; he contended that the constant practice of the biggest brass instruments constituted an excellent gymnastic exercise for the lungs . To support his theory , and to demonstrate the effect of this exercise upon the development of the chest , he recruited an orchestra of women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know not if it was really to 163 MUSICAI . EDUCATION this that they owed them ; but it is certain that it did not appear to do them any harm . We make only a note here of those instruments which find their employment solely in military bands , as well as the Bugle and the Clarion . Only one of then , the Saxophone , occasionally appears in the symphonic orchestra or theatre , to which it lends the charm of a mysterious , strange and penetrating timbre . A clarinettist can learn the mechanism of it very quickly , its embouchure being very nearly the same , and its reed simple , more flexible and less delicate . As for the Saxhorns and Tubas , they arc very quickly learned by those who have already studied another brass instrument . We will not speak of them any more ; but with regard to the study of , the horn and that of the trumpet , we shall have to return in greater detail to the question already outlined , and to which too much importance can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment . TIIF IIoILN There are therefore two kinds of Horns , the Cor d'harmonie , or French horn , and the valve horn , of more recent invention , which is tending more and more to supplant the old one in the orchestra . It does not fall within the limits of this work to examine how far this substitution is happy ; it has its partisans and its detractors . We must restrict ourselves here to explaining what is necessary for the study of each of these two instruments . X164 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS Let us first remark that under the existing state of things , in order to be complete , a horn-player should know how to play both of them ; for if , in the execu tion of modern works , the use of the valve-horn is indispensable , since they are written for it and can not be played on the other , which settles the question , it is advantageous to return to the simple horn for the whole classic repertory , under pain of defeating the composer 's intentions , by depriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well understood , this demands a few expla nations as to the way these two instruments work , ex planations which I will try to give as briefly as pos sible , avoiding , as far as possible , all technical terms which would be understood only by a few . It is quite understood that I express no preference . The French horn is derived from exactly the same principle as the hunting-horn , it is a simple tube coiled around itself , and is not qualified to give out naturally , under the effort of the human breath , modified by the pressure of the lips , more than a very restricted number of tones , * which are therefore called natural tones , and which resound with brilliance . To obtain intercalary tones , the horn-player intro duces his right hand into the bell of the instrument , obstructing the orifice to a greater or lesser degree , with infinite precautions ; by this artifice , he modifies , by obstructing them , the vibrations of the air con tained in the tube , which results in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped notes , and which have not at all the same timbre as the first . In the same proportion as the natural tones are vigorous and brilliant , the others are veiled , uncertain , timid , and , so to speak , far away . From this lack of homogeneity , which seems a priori a capital defect , the old composers ( I speak here particularly of those belonging to that beautiful period between Beethoven and Mendelssohn ) and their interpreters managed to obtain tones of exquisite charm . The transition of an open tone to a stopped tone or vice-versa , far from being incongruous notwithstanding its difficulty and the awkwardness that results from it , perhaps even on that very account , is simply strange , with an essentially sympathetic strangeness that gives to a phrase sung by the horn an emotional character that is entirely individual . But the stopped notes can be produced only under certain conditions , preceded or followed by open tones , and also without too much precipitation ; and for this reason they demand as much art on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dexterity from the executant . Let us pass on to the valve horn . Thanks to a very ingenious mechanical system , analogous to that of the cornet , which lengthens or shortens at will the circuit of air in the tube , it can produce with equal facility all the tones of the chromatic scale ( which is the reason it is also called the chromatic horn ) , and all in the same timbre , which is very nearly that of the open tones of the ordinary horn . Hence , the composer finds it easy to employ , in the most rapid 166 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS modulations and use every note without having to take any precautions ; hence also the performer gains a security which was unknown in the case of the old instrument , besides the faculty of being able to undertake rapid passages of all kinds . But on the other hand , the mysterious and veiled tones of the stopped horn are sacrificed . We might indeed produce stopped tones on the chromatic horn by the same artifice as in the simple horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is far easier to produce the same notes by means of the valves , this is scarcely ever done . Let us add that whenever it is done , the tones , owing to some reason connected with the construction of the instrument , do not possess the same poetical character and the same fascination as those produced on the simple horn . Now that the two instruments are known with their qualities and defects , we can easily conceive that a clever horn-player should be able to play both alternately , according to circumstances . Moreover , this double study does not entail any complication . A beginning must always be made with the simple horn , and a good embouchure on it acquired , as well as a frank and beautiful sonority , at once vigorous and unctuous , afterwards proceeding to the stopped tones . Next we shall pass to the valve horn , which will seem relatively easy ; and . finally , we shall be able to play first on one and then on the other , and possess equal command of each . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDUCATION at the age of fourteen or fifteen , if the chest is strong enough ; but it may also be undertaken much later , it really does not matter much at what age , without very marked inconvenience . The time of daily study ' should be divided into periods of half an hour at first , and an hour at most after having become sufficiently accustomed to it . Eight sittings of half an hour each make the best arrangement , always taking care to shorten or cut out a few when any symptoms of fatigue appear , as we have already established in a general way . THE TltunipEr The TRUMPET is like the horn ; the same name includes two instruments : the simple Trumpet and the Trumpette a pistons or chromatic trumpet . The principle of the simple trumpet is the same as that of the horn , but as no use is made of stopped notes , its scale is reduced to natural notes only , about a dozen , which is indeed very little . Nevertheless , on account of its brilliancy and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heraldic character . To remedy the inconvenience of this small number of notes , makers have ingeniously devised various means . First they tried a spring slide , which , being lengthened at will , lowered the whole natural scale by one , two or three half-tones ; then , later , an Englishman , whose name is not known to us , had an idea of adding keys to the trumpet , as to the clarinet or oboe , and his endeavours were crowned with success ; 168 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS but he found that he had created a new instrument whose quality of tone bore little resemblance to the typical tone of the trumpet . " It was an acquisition , but not an improvement . " The inventor called his keyed trumpet by the name of the horn-bugle . Then the French maker Adolphe Sax adapted to it the system of valves , now generally adopted . The trumpette a pistons has the advantage over the simple trumpet of being able to produce all the diatonic and chromatic notes in its compass , and is therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable for the performer , who with it is no longer condemned to perpetual flourishes , but is able to attack the most varied passages . Just as in the case of the horn , however , the addition of the valve mechanism modifies the timbre , which , no longer so brilliant nor pompous , becomes a little heavier . Inversely to what we have said about , the horn , teachers of the trumpet are generally of the opinion that it is better to begin with the study of the trnm pette %i pistons , between twelve and eighteen , or even sooner , provided that the amount of study be pro-portioned to the physical strength of the individual . To commence too late , after the age of about twenty-five , would be risky , for there are few instruments so ticklish as this one . Those , however , who have previously played the cornet can undertake the trumpet at any age whatsoever . Regarding the nec essary time for study , it is difficult to tell precisely , because it depends entirely upon the temperament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips ; with this reservation , as much time as possible . Although of the same family as the horn , the trumpet differs essentially from it in its effects . Its sonority is at once less sweet and soft , but more silvery , clear , strident and brilliant . These are the qualities that must be sought , with a clean , frank and precise attack ; even a little ruggedness , if not allowed to become excessive , is not inappropriate . Moreover , pupils would do well to endeavour to produce with ease the piano and pianissimo shading , in which the modern composers have found ravishing effects . THE CORNET A PISTONS At the age of twelve , one can put the CORNET A PISTONS in the hands of a child , if , however , he has not a weak constitution ; in the contrary case it would be better to wait , for up to the age of twenty at least , it will be quite time enough . As we have already seen with regard to the trumpet , and generally speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be the only guide for determining the amount of daily study . The embouchure of the cornet is infinitely easier to acquire than that of the horn or the trumpet , and it is in a great measure to its facility of emission of tone that it owes its popularity . Its timbre , which arises from its construction , is lacking in distinction . To the same degree that the trumpet is clear and elegant in its brilliancy and its 170 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS limpid clarity , and the horn is poetical and sentimental , so the cornet is essentially trivial and muddy . It is then to lessen its defects that the virtuoso-cornettist must always strive , and here , by a unique exception , it is permissible for him to endeavour to imitate neighbouring instruments and those of the same family that are endowed with a nobler timbre : thus , to have the tone of a horn , or the tone of a trumpet would not be a defect in a cornettist , but rather a valuable quality under many circumstances . It atones for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study , and then by a certain volubility , that is peculiar to it , a suppleness that can do everything , ? trills , repeated notes , and runs of pretty nearly every kind , as well as an aptitude for singing well or imitating a song , of which it must avail itself . The study of the cornet a pistons produces certain qualities for the practice of the trumpet ; but the simultaneous study of the two is useless when working seriously at the trumpet , ? it may even be harmful to the cornet . When once the period of study is passed , a trumpet-player can play the two instruments alternately , provided he makes only a moderate use of the cornet ; an abuse of the latter would expose him to the loss of a part of his most precious qualities , particularly firmness in the attack of his tone . 171 MUSICAL EDUCATION THE TROMBONE One of the most beautiful and powerful voices in the modern orchestra is the TROMBONE . Admirable in expressing strong and noble sentiments , it becomes simply ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforcing the bass in dance music , which proves the nobility of its character . As in the case of the horn and trumpet , we are here confronted with two instruments which , although bearing the same name , are very different and possess individual qualities : the slide trombone , which is the real trombone , the instrument of pomp and majesty par excellence , and the trombone a pistons the sole advantage of which is that , it is easier to learn and to handle , and lends itself better to the execution of rapid passages which do not befit its solemn character and by their very velocity deprive it of a great and the most beautiful part of its prestige and dignity . Every conscientious trombone-player then , who is desirous of becoming an artist , should first make himself master of the considerable difficulties presented by the slide trombone . If afterwards he wishes to acquire the trombone a pistons , this will be for him a matter of six weeks , or two months at most . One can hardly undertake the study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before having attained full growth ; it is therefore difficult to state the age precisely . We may , however , call 1721 THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS fifteen the limit of youth , for there are several in-stances of pupils of that age who have gone through their studies in good condition ; and twenty-five as the highest limit , beyond which it would seem difficult to accustom the lips to exercise with required force the pressure necessary to obtain a beautiful sonority , sup ple and firm at the same time . However , if one has already played any other brass instrument what soever , and if one has by this means acquired the facility of embouchure , one can begin to study the trombone at any age . Because of the fatigue it brings , one should never , even though well accustomed to it , work more than a few minutes at a time , and never more than four hours a day ; at the beginning , two hours are amply suf ficient . Firm and tough lips and a solid and well-formed jaw are necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piston , there are instruments of three different sizes , called alto-trombone , tenor trombone and bass-trombone , * all three being equally employed in the orchestra , and almost always simultaneously . The music for the trombones being written some-times in the alto , sometimes in the bass and sometimes in the tenor clef , a knowledge of these three clefs is useful to the trombone-player . It is the custom to exercise first upon the tenor trom bone ; and when that is learned , little difficulty is ex perienced in playing upon the others ; it is only the matter of a few days . MUSICAL EDUCATION X. THE GUITAR AND MANDOLIN It seems entirely superfluous for us to consider here certain odd instruments , strangers to the symphonic orchestra , which , although having a perfectly musical character , are connected with this art only on account of their picturesque quality and local colour , and have been used by composers only in exceptional cases or as hors-d'wavres . Such arc , among others , the Guitar and the Mandolin , instruments for serenades , charming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seville , or the canals of Venice , but out of place elsewhere ; also the Russian Balalaika and the Hungarian Ccmbalo . Let us say , however , that the guitar , if we want to do anything more with it than to accompany a common Italian or Spanish song , is excessively difficult to learn , but it also forms a very delightful study ; in private , in the midst of a very restricted circle of attentive amateurs , a skilful artist can get charming effects from it , although of little variety and always somewhat similar ; but it is very difficult to find a good teacher of the guitar , this unfashionable instrument falling daily into greater disuse , which is to be regretted . In Italy and Spain , the guitar plays the part of accompanist to the voice , or to the mandolin ; the latter constantly gives the melody , and guitars accompany it . Sometimes a flute or a violin is added . In its picturesque frame , under a beautiful moonlight , or a starry sky , such a little orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliciously , and sometimes produces ravishing effects . The mandolin , on the contrary , may be learned with extreme facility ; the irritating tremolo of its doubled strings , endurable only in the open air , is within the reach of everybody . For violinists , in particular , it is a'mere toy ; its strings and fingering being identical will ) their instrument , they have nothing to acquire but that perpetual trembling of the right hand which seems to have furnished the voice with that deplorable example of tremolo of which we shall soon speak . XI . DIFFICULTIES OF DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS CONSIDERED From the sum of the foregoing information , it will be seen , although this has not been the precise question , that all instruments are not equally easy or difficult to learn , and that there are some that demand an infinitely longer period of study than others in order to arrive at relatively equivalent results . This is an easy matter to understand , but more difficult to measure and state precisely and exactly . We can not take as a term of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment is imperceptible ; what one calls perfection is far from another 's idea of it . No one can ever say : I know the violin , or I know the harp ; any more than one could say I know History , or I know Astronomy . But one can say : I know how to play the violin , I know how to use the harp , I have studied History , I 175 MUSICAL EDUCATION have some knowledge of Astronomy , because these various ways of expressing oneself do not convey the idea of a complete and final knowledge , any pretension to which is simply absurd . The most accomplished virtuoso to-day will be seeking to-morrow for new effects and methods ; so he will still further perfect himself , just as the most learned historian , by delving deeper into his documents and comparing them , will make further progress in his science . Absolute perfection does not exist , and what we call by that name is merely that which seems to us to approach it most nearly , still remaining perfectable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everfleeting spot . But there is another that can be perhaps stated definitely enough for the present inquiry ; this is the moment when the pupil has acquired a complete knowledge of all the means of execution applicable to his instrument and knows how to use them with discernment . Admitting this medium level as a term of comparison , we can first establish , proceeding by families , that those instruments demanding the longest study are : the stringed instruments and the piano ; secondly , the wood-wind and the harp ; and thirdly , the brass . ( It will be remarked that neither the organ nor the harmonium comes into the question , these two instruments imperiously requiring a preliminary study of the piano upon which their own , one very short and the oilier very long , will be afterwards grafted , as we have already seen . ) If we now examine separately each of the three 176 j THE STUDY OF INSTRUMENTS categories grouped as above , individual aptitude being regarded as equal , the pupil who studies the violin or the piano will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violoncellist will arrive before him and he will be preceded by several bow-shots by the double-bass player , whose instrument , notwithstanding its dimensions , or rather on that account , exacts infinitely less delicacy and precision. ? Passing to the second group , and still supposing t lie pupils to be equally well endowed and trained , it is the flutist who should arrive first , then the clarinettist and the bassoonist , and finally the oboist ; because the oboe is the most delicate instrument of this family to manage . I have forgotten the harp , which perhaps might dispute the first place with the flute , for , when once the first difficulties are vanquished , progress is often very rapid. ? Finally , among the brass instruments , the horn is incontestably the one that claims the longest study , particularly on account of its slopped tones ; the trombone and the trumpet are learned in about the same length of time ; and , finally , the cornet may be considered the easiest of all . ( I have not spoken here of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally easy to learn , if one knows how to play the violin , or the oboe . ) With regard to the special instruments for military bands , it will suffice to knew that in a regiment , when a man shows himself incapable of sweeping the court or grooming his horse , he is put in the band , and within a few months , he is able to sustain his part , Heaven only knows how . MUSICAL EDUCATION Another classification of instruments is still to be considered from the standpoint of study . It is absolutely necessary to make a difference between those who imperatively demand virtuosity , mastery , and those who can do without it . To play the violin fairly well is sufficient to hold a place as second violin in an orchestra ; this is true also of the viola , the double-bass , the trumpet , the trombone , and even the bassoon , because they are very rarely required to act as soloists ; with second-rate talent , they can make themselves useful at need . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flutes , oboes , clarinets and horns , whose parts are always far more in evidence . In the execution of chamber-music , an equal degree of perfection is required of all the participants , whatever their instrument ; no mediocrity is tolerable there . It is the same , with greater reason , when one intends to attract the attention of the audience to oneself alone , by the interpretation of a Concerto or even another instrumental solo that is less developed . It would be simply ridiculous for any one to attempt such things without the possession of a veritable and complete talent , without being so sure of himself as to feel certain that he will not create that agonizing feeling of fear and anxiety . which deprives the public of all the pleasure it has a right to expect from the execution of a charming work . The true virtuoso should inspire confidence from his very first notes , appear at his ease amid the greatest difficulties , and give everybody the impression that it is all child 's play to him . 178 THE STUDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most marvellous young pianists , travelling incognito and finding himself in a large hotel in Switzerland , availed himself of a few moments one morning when the salon was empty to limber up his fingers and play some of the most beautiful pieces in his repertory upon a magnificent Stein ' way piano that he found there . As he was about to leave , a stranger whom he had not noticed , approached and asked his permission to let him express his admiration . " I have been here from the beginning , " he said , " and you have charmed me so greatly that if you had continued , I certainly should have remained all day long ; I have heard Liszt , Chopin , Thalberg , and no one has ever produced such an effect upon me . Will you permit me to ask you a question ? " " With pleasure , Sir , if I can answer it . " " Oh , yes , certainly . I should like to ask you if you have learned to play or if it is natural ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did not see until later that this simple person had paid him the most beautiful as well as the most ingenuous of compliments . In reality , when we hear a great virtuoso , the first impression is that it . costs him no effort , it seems as if we could do the same thing ; and reason has to intervene before we realize that this is the result of many years of arduous labour . However , not to speak solely of exceptional talent , it is certain that at a small party and at intimate gatherings , a modest and unpretentious amateur can be infinitely agreeable and make himself useful if he atones for his imperfections by qualities of artistic 179
