txt // It is difficult to imagine the effect on our conscious life of a complete absence of the sense of touch , in its proper sense . Kissing and all other caressing would quickly go out of fashion , for one item . But a world without contact the mind is unable adequately to conceive . Our feeling of reality in the things about us would , seemingly , be immensely weakened if not abolished , and we should move as in a world of ghosts . As a matter of fact , however , it is only the more highly specialized senses which are ever found defective , unless as a pathological condition . But the organs of sight and hearing , the senses the most important for the service of the mind , are not infrequently partially or wholly incapable , through defects of structure or as a result of disease , of performing their normal functions . The Limitations of the Blind. ? We may first consider briefly those total defects known as deafness and blindness , or , rather , the mental condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dumb . Let us approach the subject from the standpoint of the question , " Would you rather have been born blind or deaf ? " What are the limitations of the congenitally blind ? ( a ) They are , in the first place , cut off from all the pleasures of color . The entrancing beauty of sky and landscape , of floral tints and forms , and the light of human smiles are forever a sealed book . " Truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the light of the sun , " but not for the blind , who have no eyes . ( b ) All the intellectual discriminations based on differences of color and of light and shade , which form so important a part of space and form perception , are also denied . ( c ) The ability to read and get knowledge from books is fatally curtailed , since books for the blind are so few , so bulky , and so prohibitively expensive . ( d ) The // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unfamiliar places that they are far more dependent than deaf-mutes in the matter of gaining a livelihood . The Limitations of the Deaf. ? On the other hand , the limitations of the deaf are these : ( a ) They are cut off , firstly , from all the pleasures of music , of poetry and oratory , as such , and even from the sound of the human voice . They live in a world of silence , as the blind do in a world of darkness ; and yet these have neither darkness nor silence as normally constituted persons are conscious of darkness and silence . ( b ) While their vocal organs may be perfect , their inability to hear the articulate sounds of others cuts them off from the possibility of normal speech and communication through oral language . But the most serious aspect , or result , of this is found in their inability to listen to the conversation of others . They are thus cut off from asking questions , lacking the power and also the stimulus which come to other children from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early education which the hearing child gets from the table-talk of the family and the mere ability to overhear and to ask questions is no part of the deaf-mute 's heritage . This results in greatly retarding , if not entirely thwarting , his development in moral and religious directions . In all that makes for the awakening and enlightening of the higher nature , the blind child , in earliest years , has greatly the advantage of the deaf . PARTIAL SENSE DEFECTS Partial Defects of Vision. ? Still more interesting and practically important to the teacher of children are those partial sense defects which do not amount to blindness or deafness in the ordinary sense of those terms . One of the commonest of these is myopia , or near-sightedness , which // results from too great convexity of the lens , or malformation of the eyeball so that the rays of light are focused before reaching the retina . Other defects resulting from malformation of the eyeball are 7u pernaetropia , or farsightedness , where the lens is too flat , or the eyeball too short , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astigmatism , in which case the front of the eyeball slightly approaches the cylindrical instead of the spherical form . All these structural defects can be measurably overcome by the use of proper lenses , or " glasses . " Success in the use of books and in the general work of the school is often greatly impeded by lack of such instrumentary correction , and the failure is attributed to stupidity which is due only to physical misfortune . It is of the utmost importance , therefore , that teachers be vigilant in detecting and reporting such defects at the earliest moment . Color-Blindness. ? An optical defect of different nature is that of color-blindness , due not to malformation of the eyeball bat to some deficiency in the retinal elements , the rods and cones . The " typically , " or completely colorblind person sees the world in monochrome , in gray , so to speak . A summer landscape produces on him the effect of a photograph or steel engraving rather than that of a water-color or oil painting . But very few persons are in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of the three primary colors ; they are red-blind , green-bland , or violet-bland . Red-blindness is the most common . A plausible explanation ? the Young-Helmbolz theory ? as to the cause of this defect holds that there are three kinds of retinal elements , each of which responds only to the rate of ether-vibration which belongs to one of the primary colors . If those nerve ends which respond to // the rate for red are abortive or do not function properly , the person is red-blind , and so on . Other hypotheses have been proposed . Railroad companies have found it necessary to carefully examine their employees for the detection of this defect , as the inability to distinguish a red light , the danger signal , may often have serious consequences . Much , however , of what passes for color blindness is simply color ignorance , often only an ignorance of color names . In such eases , of course , the limitation can be forestalled , or even removed , by proper training in the discrimination of colors . The failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partial Defects of hearing. ? Partial deafness , sometimes due to removable causes , is also not uncommon . And , as in the case of defects of vision , the child is often at a hopeless disadvantage in his work through unsuspected dullness of the sense organ . The simple giving of such a child a front seat in the recitation room may often relieve him from the handicap . But all such defects should be promptly reported to parents , with clear intimation of the daily consequences . Perhaps the most common of all sense defects is that form of aural dullness which consists in the inability to discriminate pitches , and the consequent inability to sing the scale accurately . We call such persons " unmusical " ; and many seem almost to pride themselves on this condition , not appreciating the fact that it is really a physical deformity . The term tone-deafness , as analogous to the term color-blindness , might be appropriately applied to this form of defect . In most cases , it can be overcome or forestalled by proper training of the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people are tonestupid instead of tone-deaf . Their unmusical condition // is the result of neglect rather than of structural deformity . Where real tone-deafness exists , it interferes with adequate expression in reading and elocution as well as the ability to sing . It will easily be seen that there are strong reasons for insisting upon musical instruction in the elementary schools . The Blind-Deaf. ? Much interest has been felt by all students of mind in the remarkable cases of Laura Bridgman and Helen Keller , who suffered in very early years a total loss of both sight and hearing . Laura Bridgman lost also the senses of taste and smell . Yet , through the infinite patience and skill of their special instructors , both became , in a sense , educated persons . Much has been written about Helen Keller which is probably somewhat apocryphal ; but enough of unquestioned fact remains to make her case one of great interest and importance to educators . But these two women are both phenomenal ; they stand out in strong contrast with the great body of defectives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should always remember , what we are in great danger of not realizing , that no person deficient in any one of the senses can possibly have the same sort of mind as if in possession of all the senses . In the congenital deaf-mute , for instance , a whole segment of mind is hopelessly and irrevocably wanting . In the congenitally blind person , another segment is wanting . Helen Keller is neither " eye-minded " nor " ear-minded , " but touchminded and motor-minded . Laura Bridgman wrote a few specimens of what she thought to be poetry . The result would be laughable if it were not pitiful . The metaphors , which are the essence of poetry , based on perceptions of color and sound , to say nothing of the metrical element , must be absolutely beyond the apprehension or // the imagination of such a person . Yet it is very hard for the normally constituted individual to realize the full and necessary force of such limitations . Summary. ? Perfection of function in all the senses is essential to normal mentality . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character and range of the sensations and consequently of the ideas derived from them . This effect is greatest in the case of the knowledge-giving senses , and especially of sight and hearing . The congenitally deaf suffer loss of the pleasures of music , of the ability to speak , and , worst of all , of the ability to overhear conversation and to ask questions . The congenitally blind suffer loss of the pleasures of color and light , of the ability to read to any extent , and of physical independence . Partial defects of vision are those known as myopia , hypermetropia , and astigmatism , and the retinal disability called colorblindness . A partial defect of hearing , the inability to distinguish pitches , corresponds to color-blindness in vision . Persons lacking both sight and hearing , as Laura Bridgman and Helen Peller , furnish an interesting study in psychology ; but it should be remembered that no person afflicted with any serious defect of the special sense organs can possibly have a complete mind or life experience . CHAPTER XV PERCEPTION Sensation and Perception. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between sensation and perception . In the preceding chapter on Sensation , much has been anticipated which belongs properly to Perception . We are now prepared to take up this activity more explicitly , and discover in what respect it is a distinct operation of mind . Sensation is , as we have seen , a state of feeling , the result of impressions from without . It is , in a sense , passive ; the mind is acted upon from without and responds in the simplest possible way . But the response does not stop with mere sensibility . The mind instinctively goes back of the sensations aroused and asks to what they are due , attributes them to a cause outside the mind itself . Sensation is a state of feeling ; perception is an act of knowing . We have called sensation the first mental result of the stimulation of an incarrying nerve ; we might , in like manner , call perception the second mental result of the stimulation of an incarrying nerve . Sensation , like other feeling , is subjective ; what we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; what we perceive is something external to our mind . The Process of Perception. ? But this process of referring sensation to its cause is by no means so simple as is ordinarily supposed . It usually involves the following steps , or phases : 86 // ( 1 ) Discrimination , the consciousness of change and difference . The present sensation is a newly risen element in consciousness . ( 2 ) Assimilation , the recognition of this new sensation as similar to some former sensation , its identification with former experience . ( 3 ) Localization , which includes two facts , ( a ) the determination of the particular part or organ of the body whose excitation is responsible for the given sensation , and ( b ) the instinctive projection into space , by what has been termed the " eccentricity of sensation , " of the exciting cause , or object . We have already made reference to the first of these acts in connection with the sense of touch . ( 4 ) Representation . There arises in consciousness a reproduction , or imaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perception . How important a part this plays will presently be seen . ( 5 ) Inference , or the final reference of the sensation to its external cause . It is not meant that these steps in the process of perception follow one another in distinct succession ; it would be as accurate , perhaps , to say that they occur simultaneously . Neither statement would be strictly true ; but the analysis shows perception to be a complex process , and far from the simple act which it is popularly thought to be . The Perceptive Act Illustrated. ? Some illustration may be necessary to make clear the preceding statements . Suppose one lying in bed , in the darkness of the night , to have certain sensations of sound , noises . There will follow , first , the discrimination of this condition of caw , - sciousness from the previous silence and from other concurrent sensations , as those of warmth or contact . The new sensations are assimilated , or classified as noises . // They are localized not only as originating in the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street without . A representation , or image , arises in mind of objects or causes associated with similar sensations in former experience , as a baby carriage trundled on the sidewalk , or a loaded dray . Finally , we settle upon a satisfactory association and refer our sensation to its accepted cause . This process may not be slow or labored ; it may all come in a flash as the listener says , " I wonder who is trundling a go-cart at this time of night . " Again , one experiences a feeling of pain which he distinguishes from other coexistent sensations and classifies as a pricking or stinging sensation . By its " local sign , " he locates the stimulation as on the back of his neck . Images arise in mind of the possible cause . Now is the time for caution . His treatment of that cause will wisely vary with the inference he draws . If he infers a mosquito or fly , his action will differ from the safe one if he infers a wasp . It will be recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the comparison of experiences past and present . We may now define perception as the interpretation of sensation , or the reference of sensation to its outward cause . We may say that figure Perception Further Charaeterized. ? The term perception is properly applied to the process , while the product is called a percept . A percept is that idea which we have of an external object while it is acting upon our senses . // It should be noted that a percept is seldom related to only a single sensation . It usually combines a group of associated sensations , as in our percept of an apple . We have visual sensations of light and shade and color ; active touch gives impressions of hardness , smoothness , and solidity ; the sense of smell makes its contribution ; while images arise of its taste and internal structure . All these the perceiving mind fuses into one experience , the percept of an apple . But a drayman handling a barrel of apples might , from simply the sensations of smell and muscular resistance , infer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception , though the representative element is larger than in the former case . It has been said that sensations bear something of the same relation to percepts that letters do to words . We spell percepts out of sensations ; but sometimes we need only to see a few of the letters in order to spell the whole word . The beginner in this subject must guard against confusing the percept and the perceived object . Percepts , like sensations , are purely mental entities , existing only in the mind . The perceived object , as a physical entity , must exhibit certain attributes or conditions : ( a ) It must be capable of exciting the end-organs of one or more of our several senses . ( b ) It must be present , here and now . ( c ) The mind must assign it definite position in space . Do We Ever Have Pure Sensations ? ? The question naturally arises , Do we ever , in adult life , have pure sensations , on which the mind does not react by way of interpretation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus pure , or mere sensations . The babe has , at first , no power or means of interpretation ; he does not know what his sensations mean . The power of per90 THE THEORY OF TEACHING ception develops slowly and grad daily . But , once developed , the habit of referring all sensations to physical causes becomes so strong that some reference is unavoidable under ordinary conditions . The reference may be mistaken , but it is no less an act of interpretation . The nearest approach which we now have to pure sensation , unless we except the organic sensations , may perhaps be found in the transition state or moment between sleeping and waking . Some sound may have barely awakened us , and we say , in a half-dazed fashion , What was that ? But any repetition of the noise will be promptly interpreted . In busy , preoccupied moments we might , perhaps , become conscious of a pleasant odor without giving it sufficient attention to refer it definitely to a flower or other source ; but , even thus , there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguishing the sensation as an odor and as pleasant or unpleasant . Illusions. ? Since perception is essentially the intellectual interpretation of sensations , it follows that we may have false perceptions . A mistaken interpretation , or false perception , is called an illusion . The timid footpassenger on a starlit night may find a tramp , or even a spook , in what closer observation would resolve into a wind-swayed bush or a grazing sheep . Many wonderful illusions are artificially produced of a nature to make one " doubt the evidence of his senses . " But our senses always tell true ; it is the intellect which goes astray in its interpretation . In cases of illusion , there is always a perceived object , something acting on the senses , but it is wrongly perceived . This often results from some preconception possessing the mind at the time , the representative element in the perceptive process thus gaining undue prominence . ) raining in Perception. ? Training in perception , while // it involves exercise of the sense organs , is not really a training of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its essential factor is a discipline of the power and habit of attention with reference to the several steps of the perceptive process , and especially the fundamental ones of discrimination and assimilation , or , in a single word , comparison . Much of the careless , slipshod observation in the world has its cause , primarily , in sense defects as yet undiscovered . For instance , the near-sighted child can not see things clearly , and so takes little interest in seeing . He does not form the habit of seeing things , as flowers , colors , etc. , critically and appreciatively . But , on the other hand , lack of the observing habit is often due to mere neglect or indifference on the part of all concerned . Much attention should be given by both parents and teachers to the cultivation of the power and habit of accurate observation . The chief instrumentality for accomplishing this important result is , after all , only the simple device of wisely using the index finger . The child 's interest only needs direction . The thoughtful guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! See how bright ? or how curious or how rare ? that is ! " An alert habit of mind , and watchfulness for whatever is novel or significant or beautiful , may thus be easily established in early years by the simplest means . Of course , the parent or teacher needs first to have himself an observant mind and a comprehensive interest in the environment . More formal exercise of the observing faculty should also be provided for in the lower grades of school in the way of lessons in color and form , and in the various phases of manual training and nature study . Other results of value besides the power of observation will thus be incidentally secured . Summary. ? Sensation is a state of feeling ; perception is an act of knowing . Sensation is subjective ; perception is objective . The process of perception is complex and involves the several factors of discrimination , assimilation , localization , representation , and inference , resulting in interpretation , or the reference of sensation to an outward cause . The act of perception usually involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentally represented instead of being actually felt . The terns perception is applied to the act , or process ; the product , or resulting consciousness , is called a percept . A perceived object roust be ( a ) capable of exciting sensory nerve ends , ( b ) present here and now , ( c ) assigned to a definite position in space . In adult life we seldom , if ever. , have pure , unreferred sensations . Illusions are mistaken perceptions ; the sensations are actual , but wrongly interpreted . Training in perception is a training of the mind to use the sense organs effectively , and the first step towards this is the arousing and directing of the child 's attention to things about him . CHAPTER XVI ATTENTION The Distributions of Consciousness. ? We are now prepared for a fuller consideration of consciousness , and especially that phase of it called Attention . Consciousness has already been characterized as any form of mental activity ; it is awareness of external phenomena and of ourselves , of our own exercise of knowing , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are conscious of many things at the same time , but in different degree . The field of consciousness , at most times , is wide . We may borrow a useful illustration from the functioning of the retina . As we look out upon an extended scene , a thousand individual objects imprint their images neon the retinal area , but , owing to the structure of the retina , not with equal effect Images occupying the central part of the field of vision gain access to the more sensitive part of the retina , and their mental result is therefore more intense than in the case of those objects which impress only the marginal portions . Tho field of consciousness , like the field of vision , may be considered as partly focal and partly marginal , a fact to which Professor Lloyd Morgan has serviceably called attention . To put the matter in another way , consciousness is not evenly distributed throughout its field ; some parts , or objects , are in its focus while more are marginal . Attention Defined. ? Attention is focal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93 ti // some objects in preference to others which remain in consciousness but are comparatively neglected . Attention is thus selective in its action , and involves a narrowing of the clear field of consciousness , as looking through a microscope narrows the field of vision . Attention is not a distinct faculty of the mind ; it is not a peculiar form or kind of consciousness , but only a high degree of consciousness . A lens may focus rays of any color ? to form a field of high illumination . Conditions of Attention. ? This concentration of consciousness , or attention , is an indispensable requisite for all effective and successful intellectual activity ; it is therefore of the utmost consequence to the educator that he understand clearly the conditions on which its presence depends . ( 1 ) First , we may name the physical condition of brain vigor , a fresh and healthful condition of the cerebral hemispheres and the nervous system as a whole . Efficient attention is not to be expected when the brain and nerves are greatly fatigued or in any diseased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowsiness is not conducive to mental concentration . An anaemic or ill-nourished condition of the bodily organism is inimical to prolonged mental concentration . ( 2 ) A second condition is that of efficient stimulus . The mental effect which will be produced by this depends on ( a ) The quantity or force of the stimulus . A bonfire or a flash of lightning compels greater attention than the flame of a candle . ( b ) The quality or kind of stimulus . A red light may command keener attention than a yellow one . The taste of grapes may excite consciousness more than their smell . A musical performance may command attention either by its excellence or its badness . ( c ) But the greatest effect of stimulus is found in connection with change . A stimulus might be of such quality or quantity // as not to surmount the threshold of consciousness while it remained uniform , yet a slight change in either would instantly arrest attention . Thus the faintest shadows or changes of illumination in a dark room will receive prompt attention and interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse sits still , but the slightest movement brings him down upon the prey . ( 3 ) Last , but not least , attention depends upon interest . " Interest is the mother of attention , attention is the mother of knowledge ; if you would win the daughter , make sure of the mother and grandmother . " Yet it is also true that attention may become the mother of interest . interest . ? Faller consideration must here be given to the meaning and office of Interest . What is interest ? When do we call a book or a performance interesting ? When it excites our feelings ; when it makes us laugh or cry or excites our indignation or sympathy . Interest is any kind of . feeling that arouses the act of attention . The most important kind of interest is that which arises in connection with knowledge and the quest for truth . One form of this we call curiosity . By this term we may designate the desire of the child , or the gossip , to know more about small things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole truth about large things . The causes which excite interest are of importance to the teacher . They seem to be found in the proper relating of the two principles of novelty and familiarity , as these respectively call forth the acts of discrimination and assimilation . We are always glad to go away from home and encounter the novel ; we are equally glad to return to the familiar environment of home . We are interested in the crowd of strangers at the World 's Fair , but intensely interested in the fellow townsman or neigh96 THE THEORY OF TEACHING bor whom we may discover in the motley crowd . We are interested in new books , but we love the old stand-bys . The novel must not be too novel ; an object about which we could predicate absolutely nothing would not command any interest or attention . An object about which we had nothing more to learn would be equally uninteresting . " Similarity amid diversity " is everywhere the condition which stimulates the mind to its most profitable and effective exercise . Kinds of Attention. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Non-voluntary or Automatic , and Voluntary . Automatic , or Reflex , Attention is that due to the attractive force of the object or stimulus . While it involves the expenditure of nervous energy , and so may be physically exhausting , it does not involve the effort of will . The attention which one gives to a conflagration is an extreme example ; also the consciousness of one hearing the roar of an oncoming tornado . Like Coleridge 's wedding guest , " Ile can not choose but hear . " The attention of children is chiefly of this non-voluntary sort . Moreover , it is very fleeting , changing momentarily with the changing stimulus . The young child is the victim of his sensory environment , a prey to stimuli , at the mercy of present , immediate interests . Voluntary Attention. ? Voluntary Attention is distinguished as that which is under the direction of the will . The mind is thought of as actively taking the matter into its own hands and setting aside or vetoing the present stimuli which clamor for recognition . This is done under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held firmly in view . It might thus be said that voluntary attention , no loss than non-voluntary , is determined by interest , the fundamental difference being , after all , only that between immediate and remote interests . // Voluntary attention is characteristic of the trained adult mind ; it is not , however , a persistent state . The will can bring the mind and object together , but if some present interest does not supervene , if voluntary attention does not soon merge into non-voluntary , it will loose its grip and a new direction be given to it . The student grappling with a new and difficult lesson furnishes a pertinent illustration . If an interest does not speedily develop in some part or phase of the lesson , catching and holding his attention , his mind will relax and wander . He must then pull himself up and introduce his mind anew to the lesson . If he does not at length succeed in " getting interested " in the topic itself , he will abandon the effort in despair or disgust . A different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , even a novel . The first chapters go hard ; automatic attention does not develop rapidly enough , and it is only by repeated acts of will that we hold on till the plot and dialogue have generated a body of feeling or present interest , which furnishes sufficient motive to send us forward . But this body of feeling may finally become so great that we find it as difficult to break off as we did to begin . The great office of will , therefore , in connection with attention is that of initiative , of bringing mind and object into such contact that the uninteresting shall become the interesting . And the will must have the backing of a clearly defined and highly esteemed end , or purpose . Choice of Interests. ? But the will also acts in another way , by a balancing of conflicting interests and the inhibition , or setting aside , of some that others may have possession of the field . Thus the will may be said to determine what interest or kind of interests shall prevail at a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? tho checking of an impulse , consists often , if not always , in // the displacement of one action by another . Thus a boy frightened by the sudden appearance of a dog may inhibit or check his impulse to run away by moving towards the dog . An impulse to contract one set of muscles is overcome by innervating the antagonist muscles . The same principle applies to the relation of ideas in consciousness . I turn away from or banish unwelcome ideas by summoning others to occupy or divert my attention , much as a nurse quiets a hurt child by getting him to look out of the window . The nurse controls the emotional state of the child simply by playing one stimulus against another ; none the less , she controls it . And so the student checks his mind-wanderings by perseveringly pulling himself up and setting before his mind anew the remoter interest or end for which the study was undertaken . Summary. ? We are conscious of many things at the same instant , but not to an equal degree . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compared to the focusing of light on the retina , and consciousness may be discriminated as focal and marginal . Attention is focal consciousness . figure Interest is any kind of feeling which excites the effort of attention . Curiosity is one form of interest . Attention is of two kinds , or types , voluntary and involuntary . Involuntary attention is that due to the attractiveness of a present object . Voluntary attention is that due to an act of the will aroused by some remoter interest , or object of desire . The function of the will in attention consists in introducing the mind to the object and in bringing it back to the object when it has relaxed or wandered . It also operates through the choice of the interest which shall be allowed to act , and in the checking or inhibition of competing interests . CHAPTER XVII MEMORY Representation. ? The effect of a perceived object upon the brain and mind does not wholly cease with the act of perception . We have seen in our analysis of the perceptive process that it contains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way , of past sensations or experiences with which the present ones are identified or assimilated . Here , then , with the very beginning of perception , we have also the beginning of Memory . We must now mark the distinction between percepts and images . A percept is the idea , or notion , which we have of an external object while it is acting upon our senses . An image is a similar idea which we have of an individual ) bject or event which is not present to any of the senses . At night and out of doors , one may have a percept of the moon ; at any time , one may close his eyes and call to mind an image of the moon in any one of its particular phases . One may have , at will , a clear image of a deceased friend of whom percepts are no longer possible . Such an image is a remembered percept , or memory-image . It is a more or less perfect copy of a former percept . The image is believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain that were concerned in the exciting of the original percept . The percept is , normally , more vivid than the image ; and this vividness probably gives that feeling of reality which the mind attaches to a perceived object . Our images , however , as in dreams , 99 // have sometimes a degree of vividness which causes them to be illusory . A lady , known to the author , dreamed on one occasion that she was invited out to tea on the following Thursday evening . When the time came , she responded to the invitation , and was greatly chagrined , in the course of events , to find that she was self-invited . Phases of the Memory Process. ? Memory as a process involves three factors or phases , namely , Retention , Reproduction , and Recognition . The nature of retention has been , in the popular understanding , greatly misapprehended . The mind has been thought of as a sort of storehouse , or case of pigeon-holes , in which images of past experiences are stored away , like old negatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again as occasion requires . This conception is very wide of the fact . If the question be asked , " Where are our ideas when they are not in consciousness ? " the only valid answer must be , " Nowhere . " If I crook my arm and then straighten it again , where is the crook then ? Gone forever , nonexistent . The mind is not a receptacle ; it is an activity . We shall never have again the image or percept of the present moment ; it will be another one , closely similar to the present one but not identical with it , for neither the conditions nor the mind itself will ever be again exactly the same as now . The same part of the brain will function again in reproducing the image , but it will be a new act and produce a new copy of the original percept . That these copies vary slightly with each recurrence may be seen in the case of experiences often recalled through a series of years . Our memories slip . I recall with seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have often recalled them , but my old army diary sometimes tells a different story from my seemingly clear memories . // RETENTION Retention Defined. ? Retention may , then , be defined as the permanent possibility , due to modification of brain structure , of reviving past mental experiences . Every mental act leaves the brain a little different from what it was before or would otherwise have been . The gnarled oak contains within its tissues a record of all that has happened to it through frost or sun or storm ; if we had the eyes to read this record we could know the whole lifehistory of the tree , in its knots and rings and the twist of its fibers . In like manner the brain builds and organizes a record of all its activities and vicissitudes . Every new experience works a change in structure , and the persistence of these changes is " retention , " or the physical basis of memory . Retention is , thus , primarily a physical result , registered in the brain and nerves . Nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes may be is mostly a matter of conjecture . Some have imagined it to consist in a change in the shape of the brain cells , or new groupings or arrangements of brain cells , or the forming of new paths in the brain , new relations between the neurones , or all these things together . The most we are safe in asserting is that mental activity leaves traces in the brain , that these traces are deepened by each repetition or revival of the experience , and that activities which have once occurred occur more easily again . The first occurrence establishes a tendency to recurrence . These " traces " have been compared to grooves , which are deepened more and more by continued repetition of the experience producing them . Imagine a slope of land , well harrowed and smoothed , upon which a heavy rain comes down . The water will not pass off in a thin sheet , but will gather into rills , and these will follow the lines of // least resistance . In the dry time following , the wind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dust and debris ; but when the next rain comes it will not dig new courses , but clean out and follow those first traced . And each recurring storm will but deepen the original channels . So with the nervous pathways of our brains . The Conditions of Retention. ? The conditions on which the depth , and permanence of this registering of impressions in the nervous system depend are partly mental and partly physical . They are ( I ) Attention and ( 2 ) Repetition . The conditions of attention have already been discussed . It will be recalled that the most important of these is the form of feeling known as interest , a purely psychical antecedent , while an important place is also held by brain conditions and the character of the stimulus , both , primarily , physical conditions . Repetition , while more mechanical than interest and attention , nevertheless plays an important part in the deepening of impressions and the modification of the nervous system . The analogy between the effect of the repetition of mental experiences in the deepening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetition of acts and causes in the purely physical world has already been suggested in our illustration of the falling of water upon a slope of ground . Repetition is especially useful , and sometimes the sole resort , in cases where interest fails or can not be developed , as in learning the multiplication table . It also serves as a valuable reinforcement to the wank of attention . The whole force and value of habit rests largely upon the effects of repetition . Reproduction. ? Reproduction , the power and the act of recalling or reinstating past percepts and images , depends of course and primarily upon retention , as already defined . Readiness and accuracy of recall are also // dependent on the recency of the original experience or , at least , the recency and frequency of previous reproduction . I can recall with clearness and accuracy what I had for dinner yesterday , but what I ate a month ago to-day has passed beyond recall . There is an apparent exception in the case of extreme age . The old man recalls freely many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents of a year ago . This memory of early experiences is due to the impress made upon his brain in the plastic period of life ; but the brain tissues have now lost the impressibility of youthful years ; the power which we have called retention is atrophied , and reproduction is forestalled at its very source . ASSOCIATION A third , or we might say the first , condition of reproduction is found in what is called Association of ideas . Association is that relationship between ideas by which they tend to recall one another into consciousness . Our consciousness is always complex ; that of any moment comprises many parts or items , and yet it is , in a sense , unitary . Whenever some of the items of a conscious state or instant are by any means revived , they tend to reinstate the remaining items , or constituents , of that conscious state . In brief , experiences occurring together tend to recur together . This is called the Law of Contiguity . But no instant of consciousness is distinct or cut off from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive states blend into each other ; so that we speak , appropriately , of the Stream of Consciousness . Yet the relation of ideas is not that of mere fluidity . Ideas are linked together by relations of time and space . The law of contiguity includes both these relations , and associates not only simultaneous ideas // but also those immediately successive . For example , if I have sometime fallen out of a boat at a picnic I shall hardly be able to recall the splash without images also of the surroundings , the witnesses , the preceding and succeeding events and demonstrations , the quest for dry clothes , etc . If I have once been at the top of the Washington monument , I can not recall the fact without images of the Potomac , the Capitol and other contiguous facts and events . To recall the old homestead of childhood days is to image also its inmates and surroundings . For a simple example , how promptly each letter of the alphabet suggests the next ! As the French proverb says , " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes in a tune have the same power to call up each the next . Law of Cause and Effect. ? Another important relation which links ideas together is that of cause and effect . Consciousness of any fact or event as an effect tends forcibly to suggest the cause , and vice versa . The sight of a limo-kiln makes us look for the quarry ; that of a water-mill , for the pond . Any visible action or gesture compels some interpretation on our part , some idea of the mental state which called it forth . The memory of a journey or of an accident will bring again to mind the causes which lay back of it . To think of a book is to think of its author or publisher . Psychologists have been wont to include this association under the law of contiguity . But cause and effect are not always contiguous in either time or place ; and the causal relation is so important a one in our mental life that it seems useful for the teacher to give it distinct recognition , whatever course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law of Similarity. ? A third principle of Association , // markedly distinct from either of the foregoing , is known as the Law of Similarity Ideas and mental situations tend to suggest , or recall , like past experiences . This likeness consists in the possession of a common element or elements . Thus the appearance of a person with a peculiar nose or eye may call to mind another person with a similar feature , though . in other respects the persons may be widely different . To think of President Garfield is almost inevitably to think also of Lincoln and licKinley , because of their two elements of resemblance , one official and the other tragic . George Steele 's poem , " Deirdre , " which I recently read , reminded me of Tennyson 's " Idylls of the King . " Law of Contrast. ? The Law of Contrast has been recognized as a distinct principle ; but it is not difficult to regard this as only a special form or variety of the law of similarity . Contrast is only a low degree of similarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; indeed , contrasted things have more points of likeness than of unlikeness . A dwarf may remind us of a giant , but both are men . Summer heat may suggest the cold of winter , or the cold of ice-water , but both are temperatures . Ingratitude may suggest gratitude , but both are moral qualities . The Place of Association by Contiguity. ? Association by contiguity is the predominant form with children and with uneducated persons , people of undeveloped intellects . The untrained mind can not readily analyze a past experience and relate only the essential features of it . The associations of mere contiguity prevail overpoweringly at every step . Literature , which aims to mirror life , affords many examples , such as the maundering of Juliet 's Nurse ( Romeo and Juliet , Act I , Scene iii ) , or Danie Quickly 's specific assault upon Falstaff // " Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet , sitting in my Dolphin-chamber , at the round table , by a sea-coal fire , upon Wednesday in Wheeson-week , when the Prince broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windsor , ? thou didst swear to nie then , as I was washing thy wound , to marry me , and make me my lady , thy wife . Canst thou deny it ? Did not goodwife Keech , the butcher 's wife , come in then , and call me gossip Quickly ? coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar ; telling us she had a good dish of prawns ; whereby thou didst desire to eat some ; whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound ? And didst thou not , when she was gone down stairs , desire me to be no more so familiar with such poor people ; saying that ere long they should call me madam ? And didst thou not kiss me , and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings ? I put thee now to thy bookoath : deny it , if thou canst . " . Association in Learning to Read. ? Contiguous association enters largely into the routine work of the elementary school , as in learning the alphabet , learning to spell , learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning to read , we have a striking example of the association of sensations . The child has first , let us say , the percept and image of a dog . The word slog comes to him first in sensations of sound , an ear-word . In learning to speak it , muscular sensations are associated with the auditory ones , and he has now a mouth-word . When the written symbol is presented , visual sensations enter the combination , and he has the eye-word . Finally , we have another set of muscular sensations aroused in the writing of it , giving him a hand-word . Henceforth , all these activities are indissolubly associated with the idea , or image , dog ; and any one is able to call up all the rest . The annexed diagram represents , in a way , the part which association plays at each step irr the child 's conquest of a vocabulary . 107 The Higher Forms of Association. ? But while association by contiguity plays so great a part in common life , the higher forms of intellectual activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effect . The scientist , on the one hand , and the poet , on the other , live , so to speak , in associations of similarity . The botanist identifies his flower , the geologist his fossil , through the suggestive force of some point of likeness , and that , often , not through a laborious process of reasoning but by a flash of recognition . Whittier sings of a familiar sight : " Still sits the school-house by the road , A ragged beggar sunning . " We are struck at once by the force and fitness of the figure ; but each and every metaphor springs into sudden existence through the suggestions of similarity , more or less subtle . In all the studies of the school which are not purely mechanical , as in history , literature , and the sciences , it is the duty of the teacher to see that causal relations and those of similarity , or common nature , are brought to the fore and duly emphasized . The superficial and mechanical , often accidental , relations of mere contiguity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into service only where the more vital relations are not traceable . // Breadth of Association. ? Since one great object of study and mental training is the power of ready recall , the ability to command a reproduction of what we have learned when we need it , the educator must consider carefully all the practical phases of association . One of these is found in the fact that readiness of recall depends on both strength and breadth of associations . Firmness of association is furthered by attention and repetition . Breadth of association is the result of definite , intelligent effort in the discovery and tracing out of relations , especially of similarity . The pupil should be trained to continually ask himself , in the face of any now item of knowledge , " Where have I met anything like this before ? What facts already known to me have any bearing on this fact ? " The more widely we associate any truth with other truths , or with its related facts , the more numerous and effective clues shall we possess for the recovery of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to recognize , however , that associations are divergent as well as convergent . It is this fact of divergent association which leads to that mind-wandering which passes for inattention . The student needs to protect himself . from this tendency by externally guarding against needless distractions and by exercise of will to keep his stream of consciousness flowing in the right channels . Summary .  --  -A percept is the notion we have of an object while it is acting upon our senses ; an image is the idea which we have of an individual object or event which is not present to the senses . The percept is more vivid than the corresponding image . Memory involves three factors , retention , reproduction , and recognition . Retention is the permanent possibility of reviving past mental experiences ; it is due to modification of brain structure . The conditions of retention are attention and repetition . Repetition deepens the brain " traces " produced by attention . // Reproduction is the act of recalling past percepts and images into present consciousness . It depends on retention , recency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which they tend to suggest , or recall , one another . The most important principles of association are known as the laws of contiguity , of cause and effect , of similarity , and of contrast . Association by contiguity is the main reliance of children and uneducated persons . Scientists and poets make greatest use of the law of similarity . Breadth of association is essential to ready and effective recall ; it can be secured only by diligent effort in tracing out relations between facts and ideas . CHAPTER XVIII MEMO 1tY ? CONTINUED Recognition. ? Recognition is an essential element of remembering . There may be retention and reproduction of past experience , but if it be not recognized as our own past experience , there is no memory . College seniors and more experienced orators , ere now , have had the experience of finding a place , in their effort of production , where composition became easy and expression ran smoothly if not eloquently . Later on , after delivery perhaps , the accusation of " cribbing " arose and was substantiated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other admirable source , without recognition . The unlucky wight believed himself to have originated , not borrowed , the passage . This act of repro . duction without recognition , in such cases , has received the name of " unconscious plagiarism . " The man who " repeats himself " is usually unconscious of the fact ; he does not remember what he is repeating . It is a matter of cerebral habit rather than of memory . The essential fact in the recognition of reproduced images seems to consist in the assignment to them of a definite time and place in one 's own former consciousness . They must be known , at least , as representing actual former experiences of our own . As in perception , the mind must assign the perceived object a definite position in space , so in memory the revived event must be apprehended as having definite time relations to other conscious experience which we are also able to recall . no // Kinds of Memory. ? Attempts have been made to classify memory , or divide it into different kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems useful to recognize the differences between the memory of youth and that of maturity . In the years from , say , six to sixteen , memory is very receptive and tenacious . Mind is impressible and alert , the brain is very plastic , and even unimportant experiences are remembered without much effort of organization . The memory at this stage has been called mechanical , or verbal , words being easily remembered without much reference to their meaning . A declamation , for instance , of several pages of prose may be memorized with ease at this time ; whereas , later in life such an act becomes , to most , an impossibility . This " tar-bucket " memory , which catches and holds all that it touches , relies mainly on associations of contiguity and relations of sensation . It remembers things by their sound or look and by simple succession , as in the learning by children of counting-out rhymes and other meaningless lingo . After the age of about sixteen , this mechanical , verbal memory begins to fail , or rather to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . Mere context becomes increasingly difficult to retain , by reason of changing brain conditions . Greater dependence must be had on the signification of what is learned ; it must be analyzed and organized according to its relations of similarity and cause and effect . The law of contiguity is no longer an efficient servant , and verbal memorizing becomes a severe and irksome task . Disparagement of Memory. ? Much contempt has been poured upon the mechanical memory by educators in recent years . Indeed , all memorizing has been disparaged to such an extent , and all demand for " learning by // heart " has been abandoned to such a degree , that serious results have followed . A generation of pupils has arisen that blithely welcomes the new doctrine , and feels aggrieved at any requirement of accurate reproduction of lessons . This general disparagement of memory , directed in the first place against the ancient abuse of mere verbal memorizing , has now reached such a pitch in the unconscious practice of a generation of teachers that the decay of memory seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour scorn on that form of memory which is the distinctive and priceless possession of youth , but will strive , rather , to direct it and keep it alive as long as possible along with the more rational memory which arrives later . The premature abandonment of even severe exercise of the verbal memory is a pedagogical mistake . And we should take care , before it is too late , to store this memory with those useful facts with which it alone can cope . Learning to spell , for instance , is work for these years ; it must be done then or never . So with the learning of arithmetical tables and dates in history , like 1492 and 1776 , and the Latin paradigms . Again , youth is the time for storing the mind with a great quantity of literary extracts , " memory gems , " as they are called in the parlance of teachers . In short , all the " drudge work " of memory should be taken care of before it is too late ; for at the right time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should not be neglectful of " learning by heart , " though we should make the proper distinction between that and learning by role . Special Memories. - We sometimes speak of special memories , as the memory of musical sounds and combinations , of which " Blind Tom " furnished so striking an example ; the memory of color and form , enabling an // artist to paint a portrait from memory ; memories of dates , of mathematical formula , etc . But these are clue to special interests or perhaps to special excellence in certain sense-organs , which results in greater depth of impression by special classes of phenomena . He who has no excellence of perception in a given class of phenomena will have no strength of memory in that direction . Remembrance and Recollection. ? Another classification , or division , of memory may be made on the basis of its relation to volition . Much of our mental recall is involuntary ; one image follows another under the laws of association , the train of ideas being broken front time to time by new percepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . This automatic recall , of which we have a good example in day-dreaming , may appropriately be named Remembrance . Recollection , on the other hand , is the term applied to recall by conscious effort of the will . Much of the student 's effort in recitation is of this sort . A still more familiar example is found in the effort to recover a name which has " slipped our mind . " This voluntary recall , like the automatic , depends on the principles of association , and works by seeking clues which may suggest the desired appellation . There seems to be lurking in consciousness a vague notion of the word , a sort of mold which it must fit . Various names come up and are tested by this mold and rejected , one after another , until one is found which fits and is accepted . The training of memory consists not in modifying the power of " retention , " which is undoubtedly a fixed quantity by constitutional organization , but in increasing the mind 's skill ( 1 ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) in searching for successful clues // and thus getting free from the obstructive force of divergent associations . Mnemonics. ? At certain periods in the history of education , much attention was given to Mnemonics , or artificial systems for aiding the memory . Some of these systems were very elaborate , as the famed " memory town " of the Romans , described in the Encyclopedia Britannica ( 9th edition ) . All mnemonic systems are based on the laws of association ; but , as a rule , they employ only superficial and artificial associations . And the fact was at length appreciated that it costs more labor to learn and operate the systems than to remember without them . Many simple mnemonic devices , however , are in common use , such as the familiar doggerel , " Thirty days hath September , " and the artificial arrangement of initial letters as in the word vibggor for the order of the prismatic colors , and divers schemes for remembering the signification of the various " signatures " of the musical staff . Summary. ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as belonging to our own past before the act of memory is complete . We may distinguish between the mechanical , verbal memory of youth and the more rational memory of adult years . The one relies mainly on associations of contiguity ; the other , upon relations of similarity and cause . The early form of memory should be kept alive as long as possible , and not be disparaged or allowed to fall into disuse . So-called special memories are clue to special interests or the greater excellence of certain sense-organs . Remembrance , or automatic memory , occurs through the mere succession of associated ideas or images ; while recollection involves the exercise of will , and works by seeking for elites which may suggest the desired recall . Mnemonics is a term applied to various devices and systems for artificially aiding the memory . // he may start , mentally , with a stone wall of any building , adding the pointed arches of one church , the buttresses of another , the stained glass windows of another , the spires and pinnacles of yet others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus building , more or less completely , a cathedral in his mind . This is imagination , which may be defined as the mind 's power of reproducing and recombining into new forms the elements of past experience . The Process of Imagination. ? The process above outlined is seen to be a sort of patchwork composition not altogether unlike that of our grandmothers , who cut up calico into various figures and stitched the pieces together again , according to some design , into the famous bedquilts of bygone days . The stages of the imaginative process are ( 1 ) Reproduction , the revival , in part at least , of images of past experience . ( 2 ) Dissociation , the breaking up of these memory-images and the selection of those elements needful for the new product . ( 3 ) Construction , the recombining of these elements , in due proportion , into a new whole , the image of something outside our own previous experience . This process is ordinarily guided by language as employed in descriptions , and may be greatly assisted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its higher forms imagination escapes from all leading strings and independently creates new images and combinations . It is not to be understood that these three steps of the process of imagining are distinct in point of time ; they coexist , or overlap . Indeed , we may be clearly conscious only of the final stage , construction . The image rises before us unbidden , often ; but it can only arise out of materials of former experience retained and reproduced . // Phases or Kinds of Imagination. ? Imagination has been divided into Reproductive and Constructive ; but what is meant by reproductive imagination is simply memory , and only confusion results from calling it anything else . Moreover , all imagination is both reproductive and constructive . A more valid distinction may be made between Passive and Active , or Automatic and Voluntary imagination . The first of these is seen in dreams , in day-dreaming , and in the uncontrolled fancy of children . Says Sully , " The sports of childish imagination are not the product of any mental volitional ? effort , but seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( imaginative ) atoms . ' Any kind of mental excitement , by greatly increasing the number of memory images called up , as well as their degree of vividness , is favorable to this free , uncontrolled play of imagination . " On the other hand , a more profitable exercise of imaginative faculty is accompanied by volitional effort , giving it direction towards serviceable and more or less intentional products . This may be found both in scientific speculation and in literary creation by novelist or poet . The Uses of Imagination. ? In time past , imagination has received , at the hands of some , a disparagement similar to that accorded of late to memory . It has been alleged that imagination is " like a peacock 's tail , " more ornamental than useful , more obstructive than profitable . It has been thought , too , to be a source of temptation and danger , morally speaking ; and there is , of course , an element of truth in this view . " Vain imaginings " have always the possibility of moral danger ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant but a bad master . " The office and service of imagination in our mental life may best be seen by an analysis into its more or less distinct uses . // Cognitive Imagination. ? First , we may speak of the Cognitive Imagination , or imagination as employed in learning and knowing . In the field of geography , for instance , I have perceptive knowledge of those portions of the earth 's surface which I have traveled over and personally seen . All the rest of the world I can know only by testimony ; and that testimony can be made available only by the exercise of imagination , my own imagination . The facts of history , in like manner , lie beyond my immediate ken and can be reached and apprehended only by the imagination . So , also , in physiology our apprehension of the circulatory system , for instance , is to most persons merely such as imagination can construct . In geometry , such fundamental ideas as point and line are altogether imaginary ; while astronomy furnishes an example of perhaps the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cognitive field only the present , a point of time ; memory has a wider field , the past ; but imagination sweeps past , present , and future . Like death , it " claims all seasons for its own . " Let the pupil analyze carefully the work of a single day in each of his studies to discover the degree of his dependence on imagination in the knowing process , and he will doubtless be surprised at the result . Sense experience , though fundamental , as furnishing the raw materials of knowledge , is necessarily narrow and has relatively little value until taken up and recast by imagination , which gives our knowledge its widest extension . Inventive , or Practical , Imagination. ? But the doer as well as the thinker , the artisan as well as the student , finds constant need for the service of this faculty in what has been called the Practical , or Inventive , Imagination . The carpenter must have clearly in mind the final appearance and effect of the building or apparatus which he is // about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except from actual copy , without forming beforehand an image of that which is to be . The cook making a batch of bread has , beforehand , her ideal of how it ought to look , outside and inside , when it is done . The dressmaker and milliner have , presumably , clear images of the effects which they aim to produce ; though the uninitiated observer might sometimes suspect the results to be due to accident rather than to " malice aforethought . " Even the farmer wishing to set a horse-post in his back yard , and selecting a stick from his wood-pile for that purpose , must exercise his imagination . He must have , beforehand , an image of the sort of stick needed , and even of the proper depth of the post-hole . Of course , the value of this phase of imagination to the machinist , the inventor , and the engineer is beyond computation . The end sought through the cognitive imagination is knowledge ; that of the inventive imagination is utility . " Esthetic , or Artistic , Imagination. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have ? what many have thought of as its sole function ? its use by painters , sculptors , and poets , the " Esthetic , or Artistic , Imagination . As the Cognitive imagination serves the ends of knowledge and the Inventive the ends of utility , so the " Esthetic has for its office to serve the ends of feeling , especially the feeling for beauty . This is the distinct field of the fine arts ? painting , sculpture , music , literature , and architecture , not forgetting histrionic art . The object of the artist is twofold , first to express and relieve the feeling aroused within him by his ideals and images ; and , secondly , to arouse admiration and esthetic feeling in the minds of others . The work of art pro . // duced with any lower aim than this is contemptuously called a " pot-boiler . " Only a few of us are artists , but all have in some measure the power of appreciating and enjoying true works of art , representations of ideal beauty , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teachers . As poetry is the highest of all the arts , rising farther than any other above the field of sense , and carrying the mind of him who comprehends it beyond the sordid limitations of daily life , be he rich or poor , it deserves the most earnest and judicious attention from all instructors of the young . Ethnical Imagination. ? Still another field of imaginative exercise may be distinguished , that involved in our moral and spiritual development . This phase we may name the Ethical Imagination . Under this term , we place . the mind 's activity in setting up ideals of character . These are as truly constructive as any other products of imagination ; they are built up by the regular process of dissociation and recombination . We admire the patience of one person , the integrity of another , the graciousness of a third , the courage of a fourth , and so on ; and we gather up all these attributes into one ideal man , not neglecting , however , to retain some fragment , at least , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process still farther , we endeavor to form an absolute ideal , not of the perfect man , but of the perfect being , of absolute and infinite power and goodness ; and so the ethical imagination leads us to our conceptions , more or less crude , of Deity , the Absolute One . Thus our religious feelings and ideals are woven together into our spiritual life . Imagination and Emotion. ? The intimate connection between imagination and emotion is a fact worthy of // notice . Imagination is a sort of border land where intellect and sensibility meet and mingle and interact . Imagination is most active when the feelings are excited ; and the resulting images , in turn , still further excite the feelings . What is called the artistic temperament furnishes abundant illustration of this inherent connection between emotional activity and phantasy , or the imagemaking power . " The poet 's eye in a fine phrensy rolling " is supposed to indicate an inspired state ; but everything that we mean by inspiration , whether religious or artistic , involves the possession of the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights . The prophet and the poet alike illustrate this interdependence of imagination and emotion . But the same interdependence is found on a lower plane . The fears of children furnish an example , strong fear giving rise to phantoms which inspire fresh fear . A different example is found in the case of the young lover , whose intensity of tender emotion helps him to invest its object with graces and virtues not discoverable by other people . Imagination in Children. ? Evidences of imaginative activity are discoverable in children at an early age . Even in the first year of life , if the infant sees his mother putting on her wraps to go out , he will manifest signs of delight and expectation ; and these have been cited as evidences of incipient imagination . It is doubtful whether they signify anything more than association of ideas ; yet association is doubtless the starting point of all representation , of imagination as well as remembrance . In the second year , signs of the free exercise of imagination multiply in connection with the play of the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially with the // simple variety , or substitute , called paper dolls . A young child may form a collection of scores of these scissored bits of paper , each of which may not only receive its own permanent name but also a definite ascription of character and personality . A given one becomes consistently a good or bad , a sickly or quick-tempered child in all the many relations into which the little owner 's active fancy may bring it . The conversion of a broomstick into a spirited or half-broken horse , which rears and plunges and endangers its rider , is a familiar phenomenon of the nursery . So with the construction of " play-houses , " snow forts , and the like . All this play of childish imagination is admirably pictured in the following extract from - Wordsworth 's ode on " Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood . " " Behold the child among his new-born blisses ? A six years ' darling of a pigmy size ! See , where ' mid work of his own hand he lies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light upon him from his father 's eyes ! See , at his feet , some little plan or chart , Some fragment from his dream of human life , Shaped by himself with newly learned art A wedding or a festival , a mourning or a funeral And this hat ' now his heart , And unto this he frames his song . Then will he fit his tongue To dialogues of business , love , or strife ; But it will not be long Ere this be thrown aside , And with new joy and pride The little actor cons another part Filling from time to time his humorous stage ' With all the persons , down to palsied age , That life brings with her in her equipage ; As if his whole vocation were endless imitation . " // Crudity of Childish Fancy. ? The imagination of childhood , while very active , is nevertheless crude and undeveloped . The child 's lack of experience makes him credulous ; he knows no reason why centaurs , mermaids , and dragons should not actually exist . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the quickness of his fancy , he is at the mercy of unwise nurse-maids and questionable associates in his most impressible years , and often he is left in such danger through the thoughtlessness or ignorance of parents . Thus the bugaboo stories , of the bogey , or the " black man , " or " the goblins , " sometimes told to children by servants as a means of frightening them into obedience or quiet , may lay the foundation for life-long fears and suffering . Dangers of Imagination. ? The dangers from maltreatment or neglect of childish imagination may be graded under several heads . ( 1 ) The confusion of fact and fancy . A child of deli . Cate nervous organization and sensitive nature may have its mind so filled up with exciting fairy stories ? like Grimm 's Tales , for instance ? that the border line between reality and fancy becomes partially obliterated . What are called " children 's lies " are often only the natural product of such conditions . They really have no moral quality , but are nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised here . Some children are too matter-of-fact and unimpressible to be in any danger from overstimulation of fancy ; but others need to be carefully guarded and not left to revel riotously in exciting stories . ( 2 ) At a later period , a worse danger arises in connection with the " dime novel " or " yellow " sort of literature , if literature it can be called , the danger of inciting unreal // views of life . The boy whose mind is saturated with such " rot " forms low and vulgar ideals , and naturally aspires to become , in fact , as well as in fancy , the Indian-killer , cowboy , or bandit of the yellow novel . As a matter of fact , thousands of boys have been thus corrupted and sent on a wrong track in life , through perverted imaginations , only to bring up in the reformatory or prison , if not at the rope 's end . In like manner , many a girl , reveling not in the blood-and-thunder but the mush-and-honey type of cheap novel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of idle luxury , and waiting inanely for the wealthy suitor , the princely lover , who shall carry her away from the limitations of real life to a land of dreams . She may end by becoming the slatternly , inefficient wife of whatever sort of man she can finally catch , or her end may be of a kind still worse , but unspeakable . ( 3 ) To the person who is crossing the threshold of adult life , imagination becomes the servant of vice . " Vice is a monster of such hideous mien , that to be hated needs but to be seen , " if seen in all its naked deformity . But it seldom is thus seen . Art is called to its service , and imagination casts a glamour over what would otherwise be repulsive . Meretricious literature , pictures , songs , and , worst of all , the exciting melodrama and vaudeville of the variety theater , all tend to gild licentiousness and lure the young man on to perilous indulgence and tampering with sin . The chambers of his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clean , " come to be hung with impure images which take hold on the ways of death . Impure images are thus the latest and chief of the dangers which imagination , it not duly chastened and wisely nurtured , may lay in the path of the young . Cultivation of Imagination. ? The culture of the imagination is , therefore , a matter of the most vital impor126 THE THEORY OF TEACHING ante , first , to make it the efficient servant of the intellect as the great expander of knowledge , and , secondly , that it may serve the life and character by the creation of pure and ennobling ideals . This culture may be both positive and negative . On the positive side , there must be ( 1 ) a glare provision of proper material . To this end , the child should have great variety of sensation and of all wholesome experience . Children should be taken to parks and zoological gardens , to fairs and through industrial establishments , with such amount of general travel as may be practicable , that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be as large as possible . ( 2 ) Next comes due exercise of the constructive power . This is initiated , in the little child , by stories ; later it is secured by narratives involving much description , such as are found in the Zigzag Journeys , Knox 's " Boy Travelers , " and similar books . History follows next , beginning with books of action , like Coffin 's " Boys of ' 76 , " but coming in due time to Macaulay 's England . Interest in literature should not be allowed to stop with the novel , but should be led on to an application and enjoyment of poetry ? true poetry and not mere jingle . The Reading Class in the elementary school furnishes excellent occasion and means for the exercise of imagination in both its cognitive and aesthetic aspects . ( 3 ) On the negative side , the work properly begins in the home , in the guarding of children against the forming and harboring of impure images . The damage is often done early . Long before parents have awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have got well under way , through the influence of evil-minded associates , unthinking servants , and unscrupulous advertising quacks . But in school also there is need for vigilance . One evil-minded boy in a large school may prove a // center of debasement and demonstrate anew that " one sinner destroyeth much good . " The teacher should never forget that imaginative power may minister to the highest interests of the human soul or it may lay snares to trap it into all that is vile and debasing . Summary. ? Our image-making power is not confined to the present , but may reach through all time and space . Imagination pictures the as yet unseen by reproducing and recombining the elements of past experience . The process of imagination includes three steps , Reproduction , Dissociation , and Construction . It may be distinguished as Automatic and Voluntary . It may also be denominated , according to its uses , as ( 1 ) Cognitive , as employed in learning and knowing ; ( 2 ) Inventive , or practical , as used in doing or making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving the ends of feeling ; and ( 4 ) Ethical , as involved in our moral and spiritual development . Imagination is intimately connected with emotion ; it is the border land of intellect and sensibility . Imagination appears early in children , especially in connection with the play instinct . It is then active , but not highly developed , taking the simple and crude forms of childish fancy . Certain dangers from the misdirection of childish imagination are ( 1 ) Confusion of fact and fancy , ( 2 ) Unreal views of life , ( 3 ) Impure imaginings . The cultivation of imagination involves ( 1 ) A due provision of proper materials , ( 2 ) Due exercise of the constructive power , ( 3 ) The proper guarding of children against the forming of impure images . CHAPTER XX CONCEPTION The Thought Powers. ? We have thus far considered only those impressions and effects which are produced by individual objects and events , and the mind 's reaction upon them as individuals . We have studied the Presentative Power of the mind , Perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of which yield only the individual notion . We come now to the general notion and those mental operations which are included under the term Thought . The so-called Thought Powers are distinguished as Conception , Judgment , and Reasoning . These operations are closely interrelated ; but , logically , that of conception is fundamental and must be first comprehended . The process called conception results in mental products , or ideas , called concepts . It will be useful for us to gain , at the outset , a clear understanding of the proper application of this term , since it has been so loosely used in pedagogical literature that the reader is often confused by its ambiguity . By some , it has been employed to denote almost any state or form of consciousness , a use for which the term psychosis would be better fitted . Let us proceed to illustrate the correct use of the term . Concepts. ? Let the reader try to have in consciousness all that is ever meant by the word soldier ; not the image of an individual soldier but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight or sound of the word , there will doubt-128 // less come into mind the image of a man in uniform of some particular color and armed with weapons of some particular style . Tie may be imaged as either on foot or on horseback . But while the word soldier may stand for such an individual , it also has a much wider application . Soldier may mean either cavalryman , infantryman , or artilleryman ; spearman , bowman , or musketeer ; clad in any style or color of uniform according to nationality ; of varying age , size , or even sex , so broadly inclusive is the term . And yet it is also exclusive , for certain definite attributes , or qualities , are essential to every soldier . Let us say , soldiers are all persons trained and organized to fight in the service of a nation . This general notion of a class of persons or things is called a concept , or , still more accurately , a class concept . All class concepts are represented in language by common nouns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be analyzed into four steps or stages . ( 1 ) Comparison , or the discerning of the likeness and unlikeness of a number of percepts or images . This , of course , implies presentation , or perception , as an antecedent process . ( 2 ) The mind skims off , so to speak , or separates out for closer attention , those attributes , or qualities , which are discerned to be common to all the individuals compared . This drawing off of the common qualities and rejection of all others , no matter how striking or conspicuous , is called Abstraction . ( 3 ) But the common qualities are abstracted for a purpose . The next step is that of grouping together in mind all individuals which possess these qualities in common , or the formation of classes on the basis of common attributes . This act is called Generalization , the word being derived from genera , the plural of the Latin word genus , meaning a class . ( 4 ) But the process is not yet complete . The notion of a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been marked off by a name common to all the class , a common noun . This step is called Denomination . The essentiality of this step to the complete process of conception will be more fully considered in a future chapter . Illustration of the Growth of a Concept. ? The rise of concepts in the mind of a child may be illustrated by the following example . Suppose a child in country or village to be familiar with a large building adjacent to the dwelling but devoted to different uses . In it are horses and other animals , with their fodder and perhaps sundry vehicles . Moreover , this place seems well suited to the play of the child and his mates . So long as this is the only building of the sort which he knows , he has only percepts or images of it , and the word barn is a proper noun . His idea of barn is only an individual notion . But , in time , he visits neighboring premises and finds there buildings devoted to similar uses , though differing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . The child compares them , abstracts the common qualities ? home for domestic animals , storehouse for their food , place for boys to play in ? generalizes all such buildings into a class , and extends to them all the term barn , which now becomes a common noun . Abstract Notions. ? We are now prepared for a further step in clearing up our idea of what concepts are . Some concepts are not class concepts . The process of abstraction may be carried so far as to eliminate all the qualities of the compared objects except one , and then we may apply a name to that quality as such , without any reference to the individual objects possessing it . Thus we designate single , abstract ( abstracted ) qualities by such words as height , weight , hardness , goodness , truth , temperance , and the like . These we appropriately call // abstract nouns , and the ideas which they represent are called abstract notions . We thus have two kinds of concepts , ( 1 ) class concepts , represented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by abstract nouns . The old grammar-book definition , " An abstract noun is the name of a quality considered apart from the thing to which it belongs , " is pertinent in this connection . If a definition is demanded for concepts as a whole , we may simply say , A concept is a general notion . Of course , these abstract qualities are not distinct things possessed by objects ; they are , in fact , only effects produced on our minds by classes of objects . They are , in a sense , simply influences which objects exert ; that is what we mean by qualities . Concepts Can not be Imaged . ? Because of its generality , a concept can not be imaged . An image is always individual , a concept is general . Let us take another example of the way in which concepts are formed , by trying to abstract the essential common qualities of the concept tree . If we say that a tree must have a trunk , we still can not specify any given length or diameter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we say that leaves are essential to a tree , we can not assign any particular form ; and the tree may be either deciduous or evergreen . We agree that roots are essential to all trees , but of what length or spread ? A tree must have sap circulating through its parts , but that can hardly be imaged . If we now try to gather up only these essential characteristics , we have no more than the ghost of a tree . Though roots , sap , etc. , are very real , they are not picturable in general but only in particular . It is doubtless true , with most minds at , least , that the hearing or sight of a common noun usually calls into consciousness the image of some possible individual of the // class ; but this preliminary image is only a forerunner and not the concept . It may well be called a " symbolic image , " but it should be clearly distinguished from the class concept which it symbolizes . As in perception we must distinguish between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not confuse the concept with the body of individuals from which it is derived . For example , if we had all the elephants in the world gathered into one enclosure , they would not constitute the concept elephant . The concept is purely a mental creation . Concepts Not Fixed or Uniform in Content. ? We must carefully guard against thinking of concepts as definite and permanent products with constant values . The concept of ' virtue , or even the concept plant , for instance , is not the same in different minds nor in the same mind at different times or ages . A concept is , it has been said , " a bundle of qualities . " But it does not always contain the same qualities . A concept is " a way of looking at things , " " the way things go together " ; as in the concept triangle , which does not simply represent a class of facts , but a way of thinking lines together . Concepts are always in the process of growth . The child 's idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intension , since he has not abstracted all the essential attributes ; and it also lacks extension , inasmuch as he does not consciously include all the constituent species . He does not yet realize that worms or mosquitoes are animals . Children 's concepts are little more than shells , which must be gradually filled with meaning as the growth of experience and reflection make such development possible . The ordinary person 's concept of orange is very different from that of the botanist , the artist , or the chemist . The concept may be conceived , then , as a // living , growing mental entity , and not simply as an intellectual coin which is legal tender in all markets . Relations of Concepts : Genus and Species. ? Class concepts as such have certain properties and relations , a clear apprehension of which is very important to the educator . Of these relations , the first to be considered is that of Genus and Species . If , in several kindred concepts , as corn , wheat , rice , we should carry the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of each , we could combine them all into one larger class called cereals . This new class is genus to all the others which it includes , while each of them is species to the genus . A genus is a class which may be divided into smaller classes called species . A species is one of the classes , formed by the division of a genus . This division or separation is effected by the addition of one or more essential attributes in the case of each species . Thus , to the essential qualities of cereal , in the example above , we add , to form the concept corn , that particular quality which distinguishes it from all other grains . This attribute is called its specific difference . Thus the word cart represents a species of the genus vehicle ; its specific difference being " two-wheeled , " which marks off all carts from other vehicles . The number of species which can be formed from any concept taken as genus is limited only by the number of distinctive attributes , or differentia , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the essential attributes of the genus . While concepts may thus be said to include others as their species , they do not bear to each other the relation of whole and part . That is a relation existing only between individuals . A particular limb is a part of a // tree ; but the concept limb is not a part of the concept tree ; it represents all limbs of all trees . Mexico is a part of North America , both being individuals . Intension and Extension. ? Every class concept may be considered from two points of view , ( 1 ) That of the common attributes which inhere in it and constitute its weaning , ( 2 ) That of the number of individuals comprised under it , in the class which it represents . This latter aspect constitutes what is called the Extension , or Denotation , of the concept . The first named aspect constitutes the Intension , or Connotation , of the concept . Together they constitute the breadth and depth of the idea . Thus , if we compare the concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater number of individuals than vertebrate ; it has greater extension . On the other hand , vertebrate has at least one distinctive quality , backbone , which is not possessed by all animals . Vertebrate has , therefore , greater intension than animal . Extension is that aspect or attribute of concepts which has reference to the number of individuals comprised . Intension is that aspect of concepts which relates to the essential attributes of the concept . The intension of a concept is , in a sense , its significance , or meaning . The broadest or most extensive of all concepts , called by logicians the sumwuin genus , is that of being ( thing ) , which has but one attribute , that of existence , for which reason it comprises an infinite number of individuals . It has the maximum of extension and the minimum of intension . This inverse ratio of extension to intension prevails with all concepts ; every addition of a required attribute cuts down the number of individuals possessing all the requirements . Whereas , the removal of any attribute as essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concepts in Series. ? This connection of concepts with one another in series , under the relation of genus and species , is exhibited in the following outline : The summum. genus has only one attribute , but infinite extension . The individual ( which is not a concept ) has its extension numerically expressed by one , but has an indefinite number of attributes ; its intension is great . Each of the subaltern genera is genus to all below it in the series , but is species to all above it . The sunmum genus can never be species ; and the infirm species can never be genus , being incapable of division into smaller classes . This logical relation of genus and species between class concepts is one of the utmost importance , lying at the bottom of all scientific classification and essential to all intelligent comprehension of the universe . Summary . In distinction from the presentative and representative powers which yield only individual notions , Conception , Judgment , and Reasoning are known as the Thought Powers . These have to do with general notions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which concepts are the product . // Concepts are general notions , or ideas , of which we distinguish two kinds , class concepts and abstract notions . Class concepts are represented in language by common nouns ; abstract notions , by abstract nouns . The process of conception comprises four steps . viz. , Comparison , Abstraction , Generalization , and Denomination . Abstraction is the separating off , for closer attention , of the common qualities of individual objects . Generalization is the grouping into classes of objects on the basis of common qualities . Abstract notions are our ideas of single qualities considered apart from the objects to which they belong . Concepts are not fixed or constant products , but are always in the process of growth . Class concepts bear to each other the relation of genus and species . A genus is a class which may be divided into smaller classes called species ; a species is one of the smaller classes formed by the subdivision of a genus . Concepts have the attributes of Extension and Intension . Extension has reference to the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept . CHAPTER XXI DEFINITION AND DIVISION Definition. ? There are two ways by which the application of a general term may be unfolded , ( 1 ) Through its Intension , ( 2 ) By reference to its Extension . An accurate setting forth of the essential attributes of a concept is called Definition . A definition is a statement of the intension of a concept ; hence definition pertains only to concepts , or general notions . We describe individuals ; we define concepts . As its etymology indicates ( from fines , boundaries ) , the purpose of definition is both inclusive and exclusive . A proper definition shuts out from the class all individuals which do not belong to it and includes all that do , like a pasture fence . It need hardly be said , however , that much which passes as definition is very loose and inadequate . The Structure of a Definition. ? Since a complete enumeration of all the attributes of a given concept would often be laborious and tedious , we economize time and effort by the device of first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then adding its specific difference , or differentia ; namely , the quality or qualities which differentiate it from other species of that genus . Thus we define chair as " a movable seat " ( genus ) , and proceed to add its differentia , " with a back and designed for one person . " Definition is a difficult process , and its difficulty lies in the accurate performance of the act of abstraction , in 137 // determining precisely what are the essential common qualities of the concept defined . For the same reason , it is a valuable exercise , when properly directed , as a discipline in analysis and exact thinking . But the mere " parroting " of definitions , learning them by rote without clear comprehension of their exact force and application , may prove an illusory and injurious labor . All framing of exact , scientific definitions involves a careful adherence to the following Rules of Definition. ? ( 1 ) A definition should comprise all and only the essential attributes of the concept defined . ( 2 ) It should not contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) It should not be expressed in obscure , ambiguous , or figurative language . ( 4 ) It should not be negative in form when it can be affirmative . It will be noted , however , that some words are merely negations , being formed from others by the use of a negative prefix , as unsound , nonessential , etc . A caution needs to be given also against the use of what might be called " double-barreled " definitions . For instance , the old grammar-books defined verb as " a word used to denote being , action , or state . " Here is a thoroughly ambiguous statement , applying to no one class of words but to three . The process of abstraction was not carried to the point of determining the one essential attribute of all verbs , namely , the power , or function , of asserting . Nouns may " denote action , being , or state " as truly as verbs . Such ambiguous and confusing definitions work serious harm in the minds of young learners . Exercise in Applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which of the above rules are violated by the following attempts at definition , viz. : // " Sunday is the golden clasp that binds the volume of the week . " " Life is the act of living . " " Life is the sum of all the vital functions . " " Words are the articulate signs by which an orator expresses his ideas . " " Words are signs of ideas . " " Evil is that which is not good . " " Deity is the circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere . " It will be observed that they are correct in form or structure . Let the class now make a careful effort to frame true definitions for the following words , observing the rules above given : chaise , watch , oak , horse , siring , arithmetic , boob ; , church , adjective , and others . Logical Division. ? A second mode of unfolding the application of general terns is that by reference to their extension . For instance , a young child hearing the word animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition , involving the use of abstract terms , is not adapted to the infantile stage of development , and can not be successfully employed . We may point the child to various individual animals , saying , " That is an animal , and that is an animal , " and so on . This method , by particular instances , will serve a temporary purpose excellently ; but , of course , it can never attain completeness of result . With a child a little older , instead of pointing out individuals , we may abridge the process by citing familiar species of animal , thus , " Dogs are animals , cats are animals , chickens are animals , " and so on . This method , the opposite of definition , is called Division , or more definitely , Logical Division . " Logical Division is the CHAPTER XXII JUDGMENT What we Mean by Judgment ? Concepts arise , as we have seen , from the comparison , analysis , and generalization of images and percepts . Next in order of complexity among mental operations , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations . The mental affirmation of agreement or disagreement between ideas is called a judgment . The term Judgment is also applied to the power and the act of making such mental affirmations ; it is the second stage in Thinking . The language in which a judgment is expressed is called a proposition , or a ( simple ) sentence . Judgments are thoughts ; they bear the same relation to ideas that sentences do to words . " A word is the sign of an idea " ; " A sentence is a thought expressed in words , " we are told in the grammarbook . The forming of a judgment seems , at first thought , a simple matter , just the yoking of ideas together in pairs ; but , in fact , it proves to be the supreme effort of the mind . All other mental processes exist in order that we may form judgments . And the validity of our judgments depends upon the clearness and soundness with which we discern the true relations of ideas . 141 // The Essential Parts , or Elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements , of a proposition , are three , the subject , predicate , and copula . The copula , as the name implies , is the coupling or connecting word , whose office is to assert the relation between subject and predicate . In many ? perhaps the majority ? of propositions , however , the copula and predicate are merged into one word ? " telescoped , " as it were . Thus , instead of saying " Fishes are swimmers , " we say " Fishes swim . " When the copula is separately expressed , it is the verb , or asserting word of the sentence ; and the predicate word is always a noun or an adjective , as in " Crows are cunning , " " Whales are mammals . " But when copula and predicate are combined in one word , that word is a verb , as in " Dogs growl . " The copula is either some form of the verb to be or of words which assert some hypothetical mode of existence , as seem , appear , feel , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy " means it is heavy to appearance ; " It tastes good " means it is good to the taste . The subject of a proposition is always a substantive . Nature of the Predicate Idea. ? The subject idea may be either a percept , image , or concept ; but , in general , the predicate idea must be a concept , as in " This dog is a collie , " " The dog we saw yesterday is a spaniel , " " All dogs are vertebrates . " The predicate , moreover , is always , whether represented by noun or adjective , a more extensive , or broader , idea than the subject ; it includes the subject , as in the examples given above . Thinking has been defined as " subsuming subjects under predicates , " and this definition at least emphasizes a thought of importance from the pedagogical standpoint . This general relation of subject to predicate has been well exhibited by what is known as Euler 's Notation , in which circles are employed to indicate the relative extension . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rule that the predicate includes the subject . In such judgments as " That boy 's name is John , " " Two times two are four , " " A right line is a straight line , " " Mercator means merchant , " the subject and predicate coincide , or have exactly the same extension . These may be called judgments of identity . In mathematics , they are called equations . Classification of Judgments. ? Judgments are divided into classes on several bases , or principles , namely , ( 1 ) According to Quality Negative . ative . Negative . A negative judgment affirms disagreement instead of agreement between the ideas compared , as " Some roses are not fragrant . " Singular . ( 2 ) According to Quantity Particular . ( ( Universal , or General . By quantity is meant the quantity , or extension , of the subject . A Singular judgment is one whose subject is a single individual , as " Theodore Roosevelt is president , " " That boy threw the stone . " // A General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole class , an unbroken concept , as " Horses eat grass , " " All men are mortal , " " No man desires pain . " A Particular judgment is one whose subject is some part of a class , a broken concept , as " Some days are stormy , " " Some fishes have no scales , " " Most men love money . " This classification of judgments is of more importance to the teacher than any other , through its relation to method . I ( 3 ) According to Origin Direct , Immediate , Intuitive . Indirect , Mediate , Reasoned . A Direct , or Intuitive , judgment , as its name implies , is one which is arrived at instantly , without any labored process of deliberation or reasoning , as " This day is cold , " " I am hungry , " " Things equal to the same thing are equal to each other . " A Mediate , or Reasoned , judgment is one which is derived from other judgments by a process of comparison and reasoning , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice is a mineral substance , " " All particles of matter attract each other . " The word intuitive is derived from the Latin intueor , to behold directly . Intuition thus means a direct beholding . Intuitions have been distinguished as ( 1 ) Sense Intuitions , or perceptive judgments . ( 2 ) Rational Intuitions , axioms , as " The whole is equal to the sum of all its parts . " ( 3 ) Moral Intuitions , as the universal apprehension of moral distinction between acts , the conviction that there is a right and a wrong in human conduct . Logicians have also classified judgments as Analytic and Synthetic ; but this distinction has no pedagogical value , amounting only to a distinction between old and JUDGMENT 14b new judgments . The same judgment may thus be analytic to one mind and synthetic to another . Again , judgments may be classified as Categorical and Hypothetical . A categorical judgment is one that is affirmed unconditionally ; it is definite and unqualified , as " Freedom is a necessary condition of well-being . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " If a man is free , he should be happy . " Exercise in Classification of Judgments. ? In order to impress and clarify the distinctions recognized in the last lesson , let the pupil classify according to each of the three specified bases , or principles , the following judgments , viz. : 1 . Some violets are not odorous. 2 . Unsupported bodies fall to the earth . 3 . No seaweed is a flowering plant . 4 . This day is cold . 5 . Material bodies have weight . 6 . The moon shines by borrowed light . 7 . Dynamite is dangerous . 8 . Boys are often lazy . 9 . Some men are ruined by riches . 10 . The proper study of mankind is man . Euler 's Notation further Illustrated. ? We may now profitably make some further exemplification of Euler 's Notation as applied to different kinds of judgments . In general judgments , as already seen , the subject circle lies wholly within the predicate circle , as in " All men are mortal . " Men // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a judgment depends mainly upon its clearness . The bane of human thinking is not so much mistaken as vague and confused judgments ; and this is nowhere truer than in the work of the schools . Education has been a failure with thousands of youths because they have not attained to clear judgments at each step in the subjects which they were supposed to be learning . The causes of indistinct judgment should bo clearly recognized , that they may be duly guarded against . They are : ( 1 ) Imperfect Perception , as when one wrongly judges the height of a silk hat , the length of a horse 's head , the circumference of a tree , or the width of a wagon track . ( 2 ) Imperfect or Fading Memory , as when one mistakes concerning the facts of his past experience or of history . ( 3 ) Imperfect Conception , which is the most pervasive and insurmountable obstacle to clear judgment . For illustration , place before the pupil such judgments as " Arson is venial , " " Penuriousness is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , with reasons , as to their truth . If he has not clear concepts for both subject and predicate , he is not qualified to form any clear judgment as to their relation , and will so confess . ( 4 ) The Intrusion of Feeling . An angry man 's judgment is proverbially valueless . Men in a burning building do the most irrational things in their excitement . Our judgment as to future events is colored by our intens3 desires . We talk of our judgment as cool , calm , when we 14S THE THEORY OF TEACHING wish to command confidence in it . When feelings are habitual , chronic , so to speak , we suffer from the bias of judgment known as prejudice . ( 5 ) Taking Judgments at second-hand . This is illustrated in the political and religious judgments of most young people , to say nothing of older ones . The opinions of parents are apt to be adopted without question and without clear comprehension . The books and newspapers of the home add to this effect , since they naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of this cause is found in the work of the schoolroom . The hazy , unusable body of indistinct judgments which the average pupil carries away from the school are the natural result of so much text-book work , with its acceptance of second-hand judgments on authority and so little efficient use of his own powers of observation . Relation of Judgment to Other Mental Processes. ? While , from the standpoint of the logician , judgment is rated as one of the higher powers of the mind , ranking above memory , imagination , and conception , the psychologist finds it parallel with and indeed entering into all the other activities . Thus in the act of perception , which consists in the interpretation of sensations , we found inference to be ' one of the steps in the process . We judge the given sensation to be due to a certain cause , as when we refer a given sound to a steam whistle rather than to the milkman 's horn . The act of inference in such a case is not necessarily a formal judgment , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicit , a judgment folded in the bud rather than in full bloom . So also in memory , there is an implicit , rudimentary judgment of identity , of recognition ; and in creative imagination there is a judgment of fitness , the fitness of dissociated elements to enter into the new combination . // Relation of Judgment to Conception. ? While judgment , in one sense , is based on conception and consists in the relating of concepts , it is , on the other hand , an essential part of the act of concept-forming . Reciprocity is the law of their action . Each process is dependent on the other ; no judgments without concepts , no concepts without judgment . The question of which comes first , conception or judgment , is much like the old puzzle , " Which was first , the chicken or the egg ? " a question which has found its answer in the theory of evolution . Perception , conception , and judgment mount together in a spiral course . The great difficulty which most obstructs clear judgment is the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstraction . For such analysis is the vital thing in clear conception , and consequently in correct judgment . But this analysis , again , is only one form of critical judgment . Summary. ? The mental affirmation of agreement or disagreement between ideas is called a judgment . The term is also applied to the mind 's power to make such affirmations . The essential parts of a judgment are the subject , predicate , and copula , but predicate and copula are often combined in one . In general , the predicate idea is a concept and includes the subject , except in equations , or judgments of identity . Judgments are divided on different bases , as quality , quantity , origin , etc . The most important distinction to the teacher is that between particular and general judgments . The bane of human thinking is found in vague , indistinct judgments . The causes of indistinct judgments are , ( 1 ) Imperfect perception , ( 2 ) Fading memory , ( 3 ) Imperfect conception , ( 4 ) Intrusion of feeling , and ( 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other activities of mind , being involved implicitly in perception and memory as well as imagination and conception . Perception , conception , and judgment rise together by mental interaction . CHAPTER XXIII REASONING Reasoning. ? In the preceding chapter , we observed that while some judgments are formed with apparent directness , or immediacy , others are arrived at through a process of analysis and inference . This process of deriving new judgments from those previously accepted is called Reasoning . As judgment involves a comparison of concepts , so reasoning involves a comparison or relating of judgments . It is thus , in point of complexity and elaboration , the highest of the mental processes . The unit of reasoning , the single process by which a new judgment is reached , is called an urglonent , and the resulting judgment the conclusion . The S'yllogism. ? The simplest form of argument , so far as ease of explanation is concerned , is called the Syllogism . It comprises three judgments , the conclusion and two others called premises , as , All explosives are dangerous . Dynamite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be noticed that this syllogism contains but three ideas , or concepts , which are called its terms . The one of these having the greatest extension is " dangerous , " . which is therefore called the major term . The one having least extension is " dynamite , " the minor term . The other concept , " explosives , " midway between the others 150 // in point of breadth , or extension , is appropriately called the middle term . The premise containing the major term is called the major premise ; the one containing the minor term , the minor premise . It will be noted that the middle term appears in both premises , but not in the conclusion . It serves as a sort of yardstick , or standard , with which the major and minor terms are successively compared . While it may seem the natural order of propositions to state the major premise first and the conclusion last , this order of arrangement is not essential . The three propositions may be stated in any order by varying the connective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , And all men are mortal . Indeed , in practice , it is common to first announce the conclusion as a proposition to be proved , or established . There are many forms or " modes " of the syllogism ; but the consideration of these belongs to formal Logic . ( Let the pupils be practiced here ' in the construction of syllogisms . ) Essential Characteristics of Deductive Reasoning. ? The foundation of the syllogistic argument lies in the major premise , which is always a broad , general judgment , or proposition . The minor premise may be either a general , a particular , or a singular judgment ; but , in any case , it must be less general than the major premise . The same is true of the conclusion . It is thus said that syllogistic reasoning proceeds from the general to the particular ; and this is its essential characteristic . As the conclusion is involved in the major premise , and is deduced , or drawn , from it by aid of the middle term , this mode of argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deductive Reasoning. ? The conclusiveness of deductive argument depends , in the first place , on the truth of the premises . True conclusions can not be derived from untrue premises . It depends , in the second place , on the correctness or legitimacy of the reasoning process . Logicians have developed many formal rules governing this process . Different forms of , or liabilities to , error arising from neglect of these rules are called fallacies . We can note here only one of these , " the fallacy of the undistributed middle , " of which the following is the classic example : The wise are good . Some ignorant people are good . Therefore , some ignorant people are wise . This , as it stands , is a syllogism only in form ; because the middle term , " good , " is not distributed , or taken in a universal sense , it being one of the laws of the syllogism that the middle term must be thus taken in at least one of the premises . If we obey this , by placing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " good " in the major premise , the syllogism becomes a valid one , and its conclusion true if the premise is true . We have in the above also an illustration of the mischief of ambiguity in the use of terms . Thus the word " wise " may be taken in either of two senses , its true sense or that of learned . If the wise were only the learned , then the major premise would be untrue and the minor premise nonsense . Whereas , if " wise " be taken in its proper signification and the middle term be duly " distributed , " we have a valid argument and a tree conclusion . Doubtless half of all the failure among disputants to reach common conclusions is due to ambiguity , or the use of the same terms in different senses , consciously or unconsciously . // Demonstrative Reasoning. ? Mathematical reasoning , because of the absolute conclusiveness of its results , is also called Demonstrative Reasoning . It is wholly of the deductive type , proceeding " from the general to the particular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts from broad generalizations , as definitions and axioms , and in its progress descends to narrower and narrower propositions or theorems . But even in the earliest and simplest theorems the demonstration involves the use of several syllogisms . Take , for example , the theorem : " If two straight lines intersect , the vertical angles are equal . " And yet a fourth syllogism is really necessary to establish the proposition that all the angular magnitude on one side of a straight line is equal to two right angles . It will be remembered that in Geometry the " theorem " is always a conclusion , from which we work back to the premises supporting it . The natural order of the syllogism is therefore reversed in the above examples . // Why Mathematical Reasoning is so Certain in its Results. ? The question arises why mathematical reasoning is more certain in its results than other forms of reasoning . The answer is found in the fact that its data are subjective , given by the mind and not sought for in the outer world . It starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from definitions which are assumed at the outset , in an unchangeable form . The geometrician makes his own definitions in the beginning and then holds to them consistently , It is this fixed and absolutely definite character of the premises of mathematics which yields the certainty in its results . Other forms of deductive reasoning yield only relative certainty in the conclusions reached . The Major Premise May Not be Rxpressed. ? The fact should be recognized that deductive reasoning , in ordinary use , does not always conform to the regular , typical forms of the syllogism . As already indicated , the order of propositions may be varied at will ; and it often happens that the major premise is a judgment so well known and generally accepted as not to need formal statement . But all deductive reasoning can be reduced , when made formal and explicit , to some of the modes of syllogism . INDUCTION How do we Come by General Judgments ? ? As we have seen , deduction starts from universal judgments . The question arises , Whence come these general judgments ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilow does any mind become competent to assert propositions of such breadth ? The child is not thus qualified . From the limitations of his narrow experience he is restricted to the use of singular and particular judgments ; he can affirm only concerning small fragments of // the universe . Even when experience widens , his conditions remain approximately the same . How can a finite mind ever gain ? confidence to affirm universal truths ? IIow can I declare that " all men are mortal , " or that " all lemons are yellow , " since I have had no experience of all the possibilities in either case ? How can I feel sure that some future Stanley may not , in the Philippine jungles or elsewhere , discover a blue species of lemon , or that Professor Loeb may not yet discover the elixir of youth ? We come , here , to the recognition of a principle or tendency of the human mind to be convinced by limited , and often inadequate , evidence ? the faith principle , in fact . Through the operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely varying breadth by a process known as Induction , or Inductive Reasoning . The Inductive Process. ? The typical procedure in this form of argumentation may be illustrated by the following sample : This lemon is yellow . That lemon is yellow . Those lemons are yellow . * * * * * * * * * All the lemons I ever saw were yellow . All the lemons I ever heard of were yellow . * * * * .. * * * * * * Therefore , all lemons are yellow . Here we begin with singular judgments , of indefinite number , and pass on to particular judgments , limited still by our own experience or that of others concerning which we have satisfactory testimony . But when we have accumulated all available experience and testimony , there is still a gap between that knowledge and universality . By means of the faith principle already recognized , the mind leaps that gap and attains to at least a // working belief in the general conclusion , " All lemons are yellow . " Now in what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uniformity of nature , " which is more accurately stated in the formula , " Like causes produce like results . " " Nature " is often guilty of " freaks , " like two-headed calves ; nevertheless we continue to trust in her consistency . The Essential Characteristics of Induction. ? The term induction has been used by logicians to denote this leap of the mind from the limitations of its positive knowledge to belief in universal laws . In pedagogy , however , the term is applied to the whole process of arriving at general truths , or principles . This process is , in fact , closely similar to that of conception ? so similar , indeed , that some writers confound the two . Both processes begin with the consideration and comparison of particulars or facts ; of individuals in the one case , of singular and particular judgments in the other case . Both culminate in generalization , the one result being expressed in a general term , the other in a general proposition . The distinctive characteristic of inductive reasoning , then , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " from the narrow judgments of individual experience to the broad ones which form the basis and the body of science , and furnish the premises of deductive reasoning . It must be recognized , moreover , that inductive reasoning can never , like demonstrative reasoning , give absolute certainty in its conclusions ; but it does yield moral certainty , a degree of certainty which serves for the guidance of conduct in the affairs of life . Early Use of Inductive Reasoning. ? The child , by force of his very nature and circumstances , employs inductive // reasoning ; but as soon as experience and testimony have furnished him a small stock of general judgments , he begins to use them as premises for deductive conclusions . This , however , is an activity which ought not to be forced , and especially one which ought not to be simulated . To require young pupils to go through the forms of syllogistic reasoning without any clear comprehension of the terms contained in the premises is a stultifying process . The instinctive tendency of the mind to " jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so great that much error and harm result from hasty induction , the making of generalizations on insufficient foundation . The old adage , " One swallow does n't make a summer , " is directed against this mischievous practice . Children are naturally very much in danger of drawing hasty general conclusions from their limited experience ; they are naturally credulous , and need to be taught the attitude of cation in both thought and statement . Reasoning by Analogy. ? There is a third method of reasoning , known as Reasoning by Analogy . Like induction , it starts from singular judgments , but , unlike induction , it ends also with singular judgments . It is therefore of much less value for either practical or scientific purposes . A good example of this form runs as follows : The Earth is a planet ; Mars is a planet . The Earth has land and water ; Mars has land and water . The Earth has an atmosphere ; Mars has an atmosphere . The Earth is inhabited ; therefore Mars is probably inhabited . This argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reaches no certainty in its conclusions . Since Mars and Earth resemble each other in some particulars , it is more or less probable that they // resemble each other in this other particular of being inhabited . No general judgment is reached . Reasoning by analogy , thus , " proceeds from particulars to particulars , " and should not be confused , as it sometimes is , with hasty induction , which always aims at general conclusions . Take this example : A little child has , one day , been knocked over by a big but friendly dog and frightened . On a succeeding day , it sees another big clog and is frightened . It reasons , " That other big dog knocked me over ; this big dog will probably knock me over . " Whatever of reasoning is done by animals is undoubtedly of this same sort , from particular cases to like particular cases ; though such reasoning would seem to be little more , after all , than simple association of ideas . Analogy also serves a useful purpose with scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , which may be tested and verified or disproved by other methods . Relation of the Several Modes to the Progress of Knowledge. ? A word may be said concerning the relation of the several modes of reasoning to the increase of knowledge in the individual and the race . It is doubtless clear to the reader already that , while reasoning by analogy has certain important preliminary and tentative uses in paving the way for other methods , the great instrument of practical and scientific discovery is the inductive method . Daring the ages while this method was neglected by the learned , science made little progress . While the scholars of the world were content to spend their intellectual force in reasoning deductively from premises taken on unverified authority or tradition , with almost no question of their validity , scientific and philosophic results were precarious and illusive . Only with the recognition and predominance of the inductive method did real science become possible . 11 , // The question has been much discussed whether deductive reasoning ever adds anything to the sum of knowledge . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can bring forth no conclusions which are not already contained in the premises . This is , in a sense , true . But it is also true that we seldom realize at first the full force and application of general principles . It is the office of deductive reasoning to unfold the implications of general truths , or laws , and thus make them fruitful in the affairs of life . Summary. ? Reasoning is the process of deriving new judgments by the comparison and relating of those previously accepted . That form of argument known as the syllogism comprises three judgments , two premises and the conclusion . It contains only three concepts , the major , minor , and middle terms Syllogistic , or deductive , reasoning starts from broad , general judgments , called major premises , and descends to conclusions less general in scope ; it proceeds from generals to particulars . The safety of deductive reasoning depends on the truth of the premises and the avoidance of ambiguity in the terms and of fallacies in the reasoning process . Demonstrative , or mathematical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is characterized by the certainty of its results . No other form of reasoning gives absolute certainty in its conclusions . The general judgments from which deductive reasoning starts are reached by a process known as inductive reasoning . Starting with particular judgments derived from experience and testimony , the mind , relying on the uniformity of nature , makes the leap to a general conclusion , Inductive reasoning thus proceeds from particulars to generals . It is the method which must of necessity be used iii early years . A danger to be avoided is that of hasty induction . Reasoning by analogy somewhat resembles inductive reasoning . It proceeds from particulars to particulars , reaching no general conclusions . The inductive method of reasoning is the great instrument of scientific progress and the increase of knowledge .
