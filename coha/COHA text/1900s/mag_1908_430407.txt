 |p699  WHEN Mrs. Eddy retired to Concord , New Hampshire , in the latter part of 1889 , her coming there was little noticed by the townsfolk . Her name , which was well enough known in Boston , Chicago , and Denver , as yet meant almost nothing in the capital of her native State , though her birthplace was scarcely six miles from Concord . Mrs. Eddy lived quietly at 62 State Street for nearly three years . She kept no horses then ; she occasionally went about the town on foot , but did not mingle with the townspeople . There was a general impression in the neighborhood that she was a broken-down Boston spiritualist who had " lost her power . " Because , when the chill autumn weather came on , she had her front piazza inclosed in heavy ail-cloth and took her exercise there , it was supposed that she was an invalid . Not until after the dedication of the Mother Church , in Boston , 1895 , did Concord people begin to feel an interest in Mrs. Eddy and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Mrs. Eddy was living on State Street that she bought the property now known as Pleasant View , and had the modest farm house which stood there remodeled into the cheerful , jaunty structure which it is to-day . She added bow-windows and verandas , built a porte-cochere at the front of the house and a tower at the southeast corner . Pleasant View is on Pleasant Street , about a mile and a half west of the center of the city . The traditions of mystery and seclusion which of late years have grown up about the place are hard to reconcile with its cheerful aspect . The house stands upon a little knoll , very near the road ; the drives and gateway are wide ; there are no high fences or shaded walks ; the trees are kept closely trimmed , the turf neatly shaven , and the flower-beds are tidy and gay . There is a fountain , and a boat-house , and a fish-pond with a fine clump of willows . The tower rooms , which were occupied by Mrs. Eddy , have large windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which rise gentle green hills , one above another , their sides covered with fields and woodland which admirably distribute light and shadow . These hills , besides being peaceful and pleasant to the eye , must have had many associations for Mrs. Eddy , for among them lies the farm upon which she was born and where she spent her childhood .  |p700  Every day for seventeen years Mrs , Eddy could look off toward Bow and measure the distance she had traveled . Whatever an architect or gardener might find to quarrel with at Pleasant View , it was certainly a cheerful place for an old lady to live in , and looked out over the gentlest and friendliest of landscapes . After she moved into Pleasant View , Mrs. Eddy gradually added more land to the estate , enlarged the stables , and built a house for the gardener . She continued to live as simply and methodically as before . She rose early , and after breakfast usually walked about the fishpond or paced the back veranda . She invariably took a nap before dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Promptly at two o'clock she started upon her daily drive . Mr. Frye still acted as her secretary and companion , and Martha Morgan attended largely to the housekeeping , Later Mrs. Eddy sent for Miss Kate Shannon , a music-teacher in Montreal , for Mrs. Laura Sargent , who is still in attendance upon her , and for Mrs. Pamelia Leonard , who died at her home in Brooklyn , January 8 , 1908 , under the care of a physician . The Household at Pleasant View All the members of her household lived as if they were exactly as old and as much enfeebled as Mrs. Eddy . They rose early , retired early ; never went out of the house except upon her commissions ; never dined out , received visits , or went to Boston for a holiday . And why should they , when they believed that the most important things that had happened in the world for at least eighteen hundred years were daily going on at Pleasant View ? They had built their hope upon the fundamental proposition that Mrs. Eddy was the inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , she had retired to Pleasant View to " commune always with God in the mount . " To be an the house with Mrs. Eddy was the ultimate experience , and it left them nothing more to wish for . Mrs. Eddy filled their lives . Her breakfast , her nap , her correspondence , her visitors , her clothes , even , were matters of the greatest importance . Her faithful women especially delighted in dressing her hair , which since she left Boston she had ceased to color , and which was now soft and white . They used to talk among themselves about her " final demonstration " in those days , the idea being that she was husbanding her strength to perform some one final wonder which would convince the world . Sometimes , in their fireside speculations , they encouraged one another in the hope that , . when the time came , Mrs. Eddy would even demonstrate over death . They seem to have expected that this last triumph would come , not as a mere prolongation of life , but as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hich she would rise transfigured. * While Mrs. Eddy 's triumph over death was never an openly avowed belief of the church , it was the fearful hope of many a devoted creature . These credulous and fervent souls used to go upon pilgrimages to Concord , see the venerable Mother through their tears when she addressed them briefly from their balcony , and go away saying that she had the figure of a girl , that her face was as full and smooth as the face of a young woman . As soon as Mrs. Eddy withdrew from secular life and became inaccessible to the majority Of her followers , legends began to grow up about her . She realized this well enough , and she had her adopted son buy a note-book and set down in it some of her wonderful sayings and doings . One of the stories he wrote down vas that which Mrs. Eddy often used to tell her household concerning the state of ecstasy in which her own mother lived before Mrs. Eddy 's birth . Mrs. Baker , so the legend went , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united in her , and she knew that she was to bring forth a prodigy . This story , of course , does not agree with the one which Mrs Eddy used to tell her early students in Lynn , of how she had been born into the world an unwelcome child , and how every man 's hand had been against her , etc . Mrs. Eddy 's Economics Although Mrs. Eddy was now a wealthy woman , she was still admirably prudent in the use of her money . Her home at Pleasant View was comfortable but not luxurious . There was nothing ostentatious about her manner of ing , and she never spent money lavishly , even upon herself . Her laces and jewels , even the diamond cross which is conspicuous in many of her photographs , were given to her by devoted students . The writer has an amusing letter in which Mrs. Eddy thanks one of her students for a piano , referring to the instrument as a " memento . " Mrs. Eddy 's little economies are always interesting and characteristic . On one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Clark , of Barre , Vermont , to come to Pleasant View and be her gardener . She wearied of Clark in a little while , decided that he ought to be a teacher of Christian Science instead of a gardener , and sent him away . While Clark had worked on her place Mrs. Eddy had paid him gardener 's wages , but she felt that he ought to be reimbursed for the expense he had incurred in moving to Concord and in quitting his former occupation . Accordingly , she called Dr. Foster into her study and handed him three hundred dollars , telling him to offer the money to Clark , but adding grimly , " It will prove a curse to him if he takes it . " Dr. Foster warned Clark to that effect , and Clark , rather reluctantly , refused the money . Mrs. Eddy had for some time been promising Dr. Foster a diamond ring for his little finger , and they had looked over jewelers ' catalogues and discussed the sizes and prices of stones . In the end Mrs. Eddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foster selected . He now took a hundred dollars of the money which had been offered to Clark in such a forbidding fashion , added it to the appropriation made for his ring , and got the diamond he wanted . The rest of the money Mrs. Eddy put into a stained-glass window for the " Mother Room " in the Boston church ? the window which represents Mrs. Eddy sitting in the skylight room at Lynn and searching the Scriptures beneath the rays of the star of Bethlehem . Literary Activities Mrs. Eddy 's retirement did , as she had anticipated , give her more time for literary pursuits . She was still busily writing and rewriting " Science and Health , " as she had been doing for twenty years . New editions of the book came out in 1891 , 1894 , and 1896 . Loyal Scientists were then , as now , expected to purchase each new edition ( at 83.18 a volume ) , although Mrs. Eddy refused to buy back their old editions at any price . Since her followers lived by one book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mrs. Eddy always pronounced the new one the best . Often a new edition contained important changes ( such as permission to use morphia in cases of violent pain ) , and after the 1891 edition was out , a Christian Scientist who still regulated  |p702  his life by the 1886 edition was living , spiritually , in the Dark Ages . As Foster Eddy wrote concerning the 1891 edition : " Mother has never had time , until the last two years , to take the numerous gems she has found in the deep mines of truth and polish them on Heaven 's emery wheel , arrange them in order , and give them a setting so that all could behold and see their perfect purity . Now here they all are in this new revised ' Science and Health . ' " By the time the 1891 edition was exhausted , about one hundred and fifty thousand copies of " Science and Health " had been sold since the book was first published in 1875 . This did not mean that one hundred and fifty thousand persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half that many Christian Scientists in the world to-day , ? but that every Christian Scientist owned several copies . The Journal told them that they could not own too many . Stimulating the Market Mrs. Eddy always displayed great ingenuity in stimulating the demand for her books . In 1897 , when she first published her book " Miscellaneous Writings , " ? a volume of her collected editorials from the Journal , ? she issued the following pronunciamiento : " Christian Scientists in the United States and Canada are hereby enjoined not to teach a student of Christian Science for one year , commencing March 14 , 1897 . ' Miscellaneous Writings ' is calculated to prepare the minds of all true thinkers to understand the Christian Science text book more correctly than a student can . The Bible , Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures , and my other published works are the only proper instructors for this hour . It shall be the duty of all Christian Scientists to circulate and to sell as many of these books as they can . " If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obey this injunction it shall render him liable to lose his membership in this church . MARY BAKER EDDY . " * Now , there were at this time about fifty Christian Science academies in operation , and hundreds of Mrs. Eddy 's followers made their living by teaching Christian Science . They were , without warning , directed to give up their means of support for one year in order to increase the sale of Mrs. Eddy 's new book , and to sell the book , without commission , under penalty of expulsion from the church . It is scarcely necessary to say that they obeyed without a murmur . Loyal Christian Scientists made an endeavor to buy not only a copy of every new edition of " Science and Health , " but of every book that Mrs. Eddy wrote . As Mrs. Eddy discourages general reading , and particularly the perusal of fiction , * her followers spend very little money on the works of other authors . She has no tolerance for low-priced books . They " lower the intellectual standard to accommodate the purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instruction . " fi For her own books Mrs. Eddy has always demanded very high prices . With her own audience she was , of course , without a rival . Many of her followers read no books at all but hers . " Christ and Christmas " In 1893 Mrs. Eddy published " Christ and Christmas , " an illustrated poem which she afterward temporarily suppressed because the pictures were very displeasing to a great many people . One picture represents Jesus Christ standing beside a big black , upholstered coffin , raising to life a frightfully emaciated woman . Another represents a woman , strangely like Mrs. Eddy 's authorized photographs in appearance , standing at a bedside and raising a prostrate form , while a great star burns above ' . - er head . In another , Christ is represented as hand in hand with a woman who bears a tablet inscribed " Christian Science . " Mrs. Eddy wrote the text of this grim gift-book , and a fly-leaf accredits the pictures to " Mary Baker G. Eddy and James F. Gilman , artists . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a volume of autobiographical sketches in which many of the events of the author 's life are highly idealized . In her chapter entitled " Ancestral Shadows " Mrs. Eddy was determined to claim descent from Hannah More , until the Rev. Mr. Wiggin protested that Hannah More had lived and died a spinster . Accordingly , Mrs. Eddy had to content herself with remarking that her family " is said to have been in some way related to the pious and popular English authoress . " By way of emphasizing her literary ancestry , she says that her greatgrandmother wrote " Scriptural Sonnets , besides other verses and enigmas . " Mrs. Eddy may well claim to have inherited a faculty for enigmatical verse-making . In this volume she published the following production of her youth :  |p703  ALPHABET AND BAYONET If fancy plumes aerial flight , Go fix thy restless mind On Learning 's lore and Wisdom 's might , And live to bless mankind . The sword is sheathed , ' t is freedom 's hour , No despot bears misrule , Where Knowledge plants the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fount the streamlets flow , That widen in their course . Hero and sage arise to show Science the mighty source , And laud the land whose talents rock The cradle of her power , And wreathes are twined round Plymouth Rock , From erudition 's bower . Further than feet of chamois fall , Free as the generous air , Strains nobler far than clarion call , Wake Freedom 's welcome where Minerva 's silver sandals still Are loosed , and not effete , Where echoes still my day-dreams thrill , Woke by her fancied feet . Many another girl , certainly , has written verses just as bad ; but the fact that , at the age of seventy , Mrs. Eddy actually published this doggerel , indicates that her taste had not greatly changed . At Pleasant View the members of Mrs. Eddy 's household led a life vastly more peaceful than ever they had known on Columbus or Commonwealth Avenue . But discipline was by no means relaxed . Mr. Frye still had his bad quarter of an hour when it was good for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and packed her back to Maine . She tired of Mrs. Anne M. Otis , whom she had called to build up a Christian Science church in Concord , and sent her back to the West . Eventually even her adopted son went the way of all her other favorites . There is no doubt that Mrs. Eddy was fond of Foster , and that his personality was extremely agreeable to her . She may even have dropped a tear upon his death-warrant ; but she signed it none the less . The story of Foster 's rise and decline is as follows : Mrs. Eddy 's Royalties At the close of 1892 Mr. William G. Nixon resigned his post as Mrs. Eddy 's publisher , and was succeeded by E. J. Foster Eddy . Dr. Foster had had no experience whatever in publishing , but the position was a lucrative one and Mrs. Eddy desired her son to have it . She saw , too , a way to increase her own profits . " Science and Health " sold for $3.18 a copy. * The manufacture of each book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been getting one dollar royalty upon every copy sold and the publisher got the rest . When her adopted son began to publish " Science and Health , " Mrs. Eddy worked her royalty up to a dollar and a half a copy , since Dr. Foster was readily persuaded that it was all in the family . The sale of Mrs. Eddy 's works was exceedingly profitable , since the market for them was ready-made and there was never a dollar spent in general advertising . Dr. Foster 's accounts show that in the year 1893 he paid Mrs. Eddy $i 1,692.79 in royalties ; in 1894 her royalties amounted to $14,834. - 12 ; and in 1895 she received from Dr. Foster $18,481.97 , making a total profit of $45 , - 008.88 for the three years . Needless to say , her annual royalties have greatly increased since 1895 , and have now reached a figure which puts all other American authors to financial shame . But from the day that Mrs. Eddy installed Dr. Foster as her publisher , his years were numbered . The position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new and substantial mark of her favor only increased the existing prejudice against her son . Ever since Foster 's adoption , jealousy had rankled in the household . Mr. Frye had always watched him with a stony and distrustful eye . Each had accused the other of " mesmerizing " Mrs. Eddy against him , and of using her affection for his own advantage . Mrs. Eddy herself did not  |p704  make matters any better . On several occasions when she was vexed with Mr. Frye , she took , or threatened to take , his accounts away from him and give them to Dr. Foster . Mr. Frye 's accounts meant almost as much to him as " Science and Health " did to Mrs. Eddy , and he did not like to have them interfered with . Downfall of the Adopted Son There was jealousy in Boston , as well as at Pleasant View . Some of the workers there complained that Dr. Foster had been made too prominent , and that he had more personal influence than any one except Mrs. Eddy herself should have ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After he became his mother 's publisher , Dr. Foster had to be in Boston much of the time , and stayed , when he was there , at the Commonwealth Avenue house . In his absence from Concord , one charge after another was made against him to Mrs. Eddy . Pressure was brought to bear upon her from this quarter and from that , and she seems to have realized that her favorite was marked for sacrifice Dr. Foster relates that , upon one occasion when they were alone together , his mother drew him to the sofa and took his hand , saving despairingly , " Bennie , if I ever ask you to go away from me , do not leave me . " She told him that she wanted him always near her , but tha : " mesmerism " had come between them . Undoubtedly Mrs. Eddy herself had become somewhat alarmed when she realized what authority she had placed in Dr. Foster 's hands ; it was quite possible for her to trust him and to doubt him , to want him and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she wrote him after she sent him away have not a very candid tone . Stories kept coming to Mrs. Eddy to the effect that Dr. Foster was short in his accounts , that he had conducted himself improperly with a married woman who had done some work in the publication-office , etc. , etc . Finally , in the spring of 1896 , Mrs. Eddy took the publishing business away from her son and transferred it to Joseph Armstrong . a Christian Scientist who had formerly been a banker id Kansas . Foster Eddy was now instructed to go to Philadelphia and build up a church . There was already aiChristian Science church in Philadelphia , and When Dr. Foster arrived there he found that he had been discredited with the Philadelphia following by letters from Boston . It was his mother 's way not to tell him frankly that she was through with him , though , after he reached his destination , she dropped the old appellations , " My Dearest , " " Dearest One , " " Dearest Mama 's Darling , " * and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in the following tone : " DEAR DOCTOR , I have silenced every word of the slander started in Boston about that woman by saying that I had not the least idea of any wrong conduct between you and her , for I know you are chaste . . . . This silly stuff is dead . Always kindly yours , " MARY BAKER EDDY . " Dr. Foster left Boston by water , and on the day he sailed away  |p705  Mrs. Eddy sent flowers to the boat , and a crowd of Christian Scientists were at the wharf to see him off . But as the adopted son stood by the deck-rail with his bouquet , and watched the water widen between him and Boston , he realized the import of this cordiality , and knew that , through the crowd on the shore , his mother had waved him a blithe and long adieu . After Dr. Foster reached Philadelphia and found that Christian Scientists there had been warned to have nothing to do with him , he went back to Concord to lay his wrongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house in which , a few months before , he had been master , but cut short the interview and went up-stairs while he was speaking. * When she was through with a man , she was through . Dr. Foster knew his mother well enough to realize that . He made no attempt to push his case or further to practise Christian Science . He was given no opportunity to refute the charges made against hint . As Mrs. Eddy 's son and personal representative , Dr. Foster had been regarded as a sort of crown prince by Christian Scientists . He had been the first president of the Mother Church , had held all of Mrs. Eddy 's highest offices , and had been listened to as her very mouthpiece . Ever since she had become inaccessible at Pleasant View , Dr. Foster had been the natural recipient of the adulation that had formerly been hers . His arrival at a Christian Science convention caused almost as much excitement as if Mrs. Eddy herself had come . The men were always glad to have some point to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech and told him how much they had been uplifted by his articles in the Journal . Wherever the Doctor went in Boston , he was pretty sure to meet people who greeted him with the greatest deference and an eager , anxious smile . Even those who did not like him tried to please him , because they believed that he could influence Mrs. Eddy for or against any one . Mrs. Eddy 's word had made Foster , and her word unmade him . From the moment the Christian Scientists understood that he was no longer in favor with his mother , Dr. Foster was ostracized . The people who had once crowded about him whenever he appeared in public no longer recognized him when they passed him in the street . When he approached a group of Christian Scientists , they melted away . Legally , of course , he was still Mrs. Eddy 's adopted son , but she did not trouble herself about that , apparently . She made no charge against him , demanded no explanation ; she simply erased him from her consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discharged . Dr. Foster traveled in the West and in Alaska for a time , and then settled down at his old home at Waterbury Center , Vermont , where he now lives . Like the rest of Mrs. Eddy 's outworn favorites , he has been content to live very quietly since his fall , and he has not even resumed the practice of medicine , for fear of further angering his adopted mother . Advantages of Mrs. Eddy 's Retirement Mrs. Eddy 's retirement in Concord meant no relaxation of her vigilance over her church . Scarcely a day passed that one of her executives did not board the train at Boston , take the two hours ' ride up the Merrimac , and present himself , confident and smiling , at Pleasant View . The affairs of the Mother Church certainly ran much more smoothly with Mrs. Eddy out of the city . The hundred little annoyances which had so often led her into indiscretions were now kept from her . She planted and pulled up , built and tore down , ? or , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and countermanded , ? as tirelessly as ever ; but now that she worked through other people , her plans were not executed so rapidly , and she had time to change her mind before her first decision was made public . It was now possible for her executives to present questions to her with some  |p706  care , and even to work up a case before they presented it . They kept Mrs. Eddy informed upon the affairs of the Boston church and upon what went on in the field , but petty annoyances they kept from her . Her inability to interfere hourly gave her assistants an opportunity to execute her wishes temperately and successfully . Mrs. Eddy , the " Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science , " was still in the field , through her executives , as active and powerful as ever ; while Mrs. Eddy , the woman , with all her disturbing personal idiosyncrasies , was safely housed at Pleasant View , surrounded by devoted and sympathetic persons whose hourly care it was to calm and soothe her . The Rule of Service After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Eddy visited Boston but four times , and on each occasion remained in the city only a few hours. * In her retirement she has not been cut off from such of her followers as she has wished to see . Whenever she has become interested in one of the workers in the field , she has sent for him or her to join her at Pleasant View . By a by-law of the church , Mrs. Eddy is empowered to send for any Christian Scientist , wherever he may be , and to bring him to Pleasant View , to serve her for as long as twelve months , if need be , in whatever capacity she may designate ; his recompense being twelve hundred dollars a year and his expenses.fi Under this rule , a bank president whose time is worth $50,000 a year might be summoned to Pleasant View to serve for a hundred dollars a month . But Mrs. Eddy is the last woman in the world to make unreasonable demands of her influential followers , and no greater honor can befall a Christian Scientist than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call is looked upon as a recognition of the recipient 's progress in " Science , " and as a rare opportunity for spiritual growth . Concerning this service at Pleasant View , Mrs. Eddy wrote in the Christian Science Sentinel of April 25 , 1903 : " SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS " DIARY BAKER G. EDDY " Who shall be greatest ? " The great Master said : He that is least in the kingdom of heaven ' ? that is , he who hath in his heart in the least the kingdom of heaven , the reign of holiness , shall be greatest . " Who shall inherit the earth ? " The meek who sit at the feet of Truth , bathing the human understanding with tears of repentance , and washing it clean from the taints of self-righteousness , hypocrisy , envy ? shall inherit the earth ? for wisdom is justified of her children . " Who shall dwell in Thy Holy Hill ? " He that walketh uprightly , and worketh righteousness , and speaketh the truth in his heart . " Who shall be called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has the divine presumption to say : For I know whom I have believed , and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day ' ( St. Paul ) . It goes without saying that such a one was never called to Pleasant View for penance or reformation ; and I call none others , unless I mistake their calling . No mesmerist , nor disloyal Christian Scientist is fit to come hither , I have no use for such , and there can not be found at Pleasant View one of this sort . For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord , and because of these abominations the Lord thy God cloth drive them out from before thee . ' ( Deuteronomy , 18 ) . " It is true that loyal Christian Scientists called to the home of the Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science , can acquire in one year the Science that otherwise might cost them a half century . But this should not be the incentive for going thither . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus lose all selfishness as she has lost it , and thereby help themselves and the whole world , as she has done according to this saying of Christ Jesus : And whosoever loth not bear his cross and come after me , can not be my disciple . " ' Josephine Curtis Woodbury Mrs. Eddy 's absence from Boston made it possible for some of her ambitious leaders there to exercise a stronger personal influence than  |p707  they could ever have done had she been at her old headquarters on Commonwealth Avenue . This opportunity was seized , and abused , so Mrs. Eddy thought , by one of her most prominent aids , Josephine Curtis Woodbury . Mrs. Woodbury had been associated with Mrs. Eddy since 1879 , and had been oneof her foremost healers and teachers . She had written a great deal for the journal , had preached and lectured as far west as Denver , had organized classes and church societies , and had conducted a Christian Science " academy " at the Hotel Berkshire , in Boston . Mrs. Woodbury was clever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tongue and pen , and she possessed an amazing personal influence over her adherents . I n short , she was the only Christian Scientist in Boston who ever bade fair to rival Mrs. Eddy in personal prominence . Like Mrs. Eddy , she was ambitious , and delighted in any sort of leadership , and , like Mrs. Eddy , she had the faculty of money-getting . She , too , could send her students hither and yon , and keep them dancing attendance upon her telegrams . Some of them lived in her house and went to Maine with her in the summer ; they sat spellbound at her lectures , and put their time and goods at her disposal . The Romantic School Mrs. Woodbury 's group of students and followers were , on the whole , very different from the simple , rule-abiding Christian Scientists who had been taught directly under Mrs. Eddy 's personal supervision . Mrs. Eddy 's own people never got very far away from her hardand-fast business principles , while Mrs. Woodbury 's students were distinctly fanciful and sentimental , and strove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stout homespun . There was a musician or two among them , and a young illustrator and his handsome wife , and most of them wrote verses . Some of Mrs. Woodbury 's students went abroad with her , and acquired the habit of interlarding the regular Christian Science phraseology with a little French . Mrs. Woodbury and her students lived in a kind of miracle-play of their own ; bad inspirations and revelations and premonitions ; kept mental trysts ; saw portents and mystic meanings in everything ; and spoke of God as coming and going , agreeing and disagreeing with them . Some of them affected cell-like sleeping-chambers , with white walls , bare except for a picture of Christ . They longed for martyrdom , and made desperate adventures out of the most commonplace occurrences . Mrs. Woodbury herself had this miracle-loving temperament . Her room was lined with pictures of the Madonna . When she went to Denver to lecture on Christian Science in 1887 , her train was caught in a blizzard ; in relating this experience , she describes herself as " face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water on the Nantasket coast ; Mrs. Woodbury " treated " them , and they recovered . She writes upon this incident a dramatic article entitled " Drowning Overcome . " Mrs. Woodbury and her students thus succeeded in giving to Mrs. Eddy 's homely " Science " ? pieced together in dull New England shoe towns and first taught to people who worked with their hands ? an emotional coloring which was very distasteful to Mrs. Eddy herself . Neurotic and hysterical though Mrs. Eddy was , her common sense and singular lack of imagination had kept her from sentimental vaporings . Never was any woman less the religieuse . " Discovering and founding " Christian Science had been her business , performed , in spite of all her flightiness , in a businesslike manner , and her success was eminently a businesslike success . With yearnings and questings and raptures Mrs. Eddy had little patience , and Mrs. Woodbury 's romantic school , with its spiritual alliances , annoyed her beyond expression . " Mental Generation " Meanwhile , Mrs. Woodbury 's students inevitably found their miracle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son whom her followers believed was the result of an immaculate conception , and an exemplification of Mrs. Eddy 's theory of " mental generation . " Mrs. Woodbury named her child " The Prince of Peace , " and baptized him at Ocean Point , Maine , in a pool which she called " Bethsada . " " While there , " writes Mrs. Woodbury , " occurred the thought of baptizing little Prince in a singularly beautiful salt pool , whose rocky bottom was dry at low tide and overflowing at high tide , but especially attractive at mid-tide , with its two feet of crystal water . A crowd of people had assembled on the neighboring bluffs , when I brought him from our cottage not far away , and laid him three times prayerfully in the pool ; and when he was lifted therefrom , they joined in a spontaneously appropriate hymn of praise . " Mrs. Woodbury would not permit the child , who was called Prince for short , to address her husband as " father , " but insisted that he address Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The fact that he was a fine , healthy baby , and was never ill , seemed to Mrs. Woodbury 's disciples conclusive evidence that he was the Divine principle of Christian Science  |p708  made manifest in the flesh . It was their pleasure to bring gifts to Prince ; to discover in his behavior indications of his spiritual nature ; and they professed to believe that when he grew to manhood he would enter upon his Divine ministry . Six months before the birth of Prince , Mrs. Woodbury paid a visit to Mrs. Eddy , and she seems to imply that the venerable leader oracularly foretold the coming of her child . " In January , " writes Mrs. Woodbury , " I enjoyed a visit with my ever-beloved Teacher , who gave comfort in these words , though at the moment they were not received in their deeper import : Go home and be happy . Commit thy ways unto the Lord . Trust him , and he will bring it to pass . ' " This may have suggested to the faithful the visit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sort in progress , Mrs. Eddy had certainly no intention of playing Elizabeth to Mrs. Woodbury 's Mary . When word was brought her of the birth of Mrs. Woodbury 's " little Immanuel , " as he was often called , she was far from being convinced . " Child of light ! " she exclaimed indignantly . " She knows it is an imp of Satan . " In the libel suit which Mrs. Woodbury later brought against her Teacher , a letter to her from Mrs.  |p709  Eddy was read in court , in which Mrs. Eddy said : " Those awful reports about you , namely that your last child was illegitimate etc . I again and again tried to suppress that report ; also for what you tried to make people believe ; namely , that that child was an immaculate conception , . . . and you replied that it was incarnated with the Devil . " Mrs. Eddy was the more vexed with Mrs. Woodbury because she herself had undoubtedly taught that in the future , when the world had attained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by communion with the Divine mind ; but she probably had no idea that any one of her students , ambitious to " demonstrate over material claims , " would actually attempt to put this theory into practice . She was wise enough , moreover , to see that such extravagant claims would bring Christian Science into disrepute , and she vigorously denounced Mrs. Woodbury 's zeal . The withdrawal of Mrs. Eddy 's support left Mrs. Woodbury in an embarrassing and somewhat absurd predicament . The most astonishing feature of this astonishing situation was that Mrs. Woodbury 's husband , whose position was certainly unique in history , never openly contradicted the legend concerning his son or interfered with the votive offerings which were made him . Mrs. Woodbury 's Law-suits Besides her school in Boston , Mrs. Woodbury had a large following in Maine , where she usually spent the summer . The charge had often been made against her that she carried her personal influence over her students to an unwarrantable extent , and in 1896 Fred D. Chamberlain began a suit against her for the alienation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Woodbury 's . At this time , the Boston Traveler , in discussing Mr. Chamberlain 's charge , took up the question of the claims that were made for Mrs. Woodbury 's son , Prince . The Traveler asserted that some of Mrs. Woodbury 's students had been induced against their will to buy stock in an " airengine " which Mr. Woodbury was exploiting , and published interviews with George Macomber and H. E. Jones , both of Augusta , Maine , who stated that their wives had believed that Mrs. Woodbury 's child was immaculately conceived , had desired to make presents to it , and had urged their husbands to buy stock in the air-engine . The Traveler also made the statement that Evelyn I . Rowe , of Augusta , had applied for a divorce from her husband upon the ground of non-support , saying that he gave all his earnings toward the education and support of Mrs. Woodbury 's son , Prince , whom Mr. Rowe believed to have been immaculately conceived . After the publication of this and other damaging evidence , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost her case . All this notoriety brought matters to a crisis between Mrs. Woodbury and Mrs. Eddy . Although Mrs. Eddy had found Mrs. Woodbury very useful , she had long distrusted her discretion , and had endeavored in various ways to put a check upon her . Mrs. Woodbury had first become a member of Mrs. Eddy 's church in 1886 . When the Mother Church was reorganized , it was necessary , in order that Mrs. Eddy might cull out such persons as were distasteful to her , that all the old members apply for admission and be voted upon , just as were the new candidates . Mrs. Woodbury was admitted only upon the condition that she would undergo a two years ' probation , and she seems to have had some difficulty in getting back even upon those terms . Several months before her admission on probation , she wrote to Mrs. Eddy , begging her to use her personal influence in her behalf . To this petition Mrs. Eddy replied : " February 27 , 1895 " MRS WOODBURY " Dear Student : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church . I have made a rule , which has been published in our journal that I shall not be consulted on the applications for membership to this church or dismissals from it . This responsibility must rest on the First Members according to the rules of the church . Hence I return your letter to you and the church . " May the love that must govern you and the church influence your motives , is my fervent wish ; But remember , dear student , that malicious hypnotism is no excuse for sin . But God 's grace is sufficient to govern our lives and lead us to moral ends . " With love " MARY BAKER G. EDDY . " On April 8 Mrs. Eddy wrote to Mrs. Wood-bury : " Now , dear student try one year not to tell a single falsehood , or to practise one cheat , or to break the decalogue , and if you do this to the best of your ability at the end of that year God will give you a place in our church as sure as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't return evil for evil , and you will have your reward . "  |p710  April 17 Mrs. Eddy again wrote Mrs. Woodbury a warning letter : " MY DEAR STUDENT : I am willing you should let them read my letter . I forgot to mention this , hence my second line to you . Now mark what I say . This is your last chance , and you will succeed in getting back , and should . But this I warn you , to stop falsifying and living unpurely in thought , in vile schemes , in fraudulent money-getting , etc . I speak plainly even as the need is . " I am not ignorant of your sins , and I am trying to have you in the church for protection from those temptations , and to effect your full reformation . Remember , the M. A. M. , which you say in your letter causes you to sin , is not idle , and will cause you to repeat them , and so turn you again from the church , unless you pray God to keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you and your students are mentally speaking to me , I warn you this is forbidden by a strict rule of the by-laws as well as by conscience . " MARY B. EDDY . " After her admission to the Mother Church , Mrs. Woodbury did not go through her two years ' probation . Her name was dropped from the church roll in the fall of the first year , and in the following spring ( March 24 , 1896 ) she was reinstated . Ten days later she was , in the language of the directors , " forever excommunicated . " " The Path Perilous " What Mrs. Eddy wished was that Mrs. Woodbury should blot herself out completely and cease to identify herself in any way with Christian Science . " How dare you , " she wrote to Mrs. Woodbury in the spring of 1896 , " how dare you in the sight of God , and with your character behind the curtain , and your students ready to lift it on you , pursue the path perilous ? " But Mrs. Woodbury was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aforetime obliterated themselves at Mrs. Eddy 's bidding . She insisted upon going to . Airs . Eddy 's church even after the directors refused to let her a pew , and after the little Prince of Peace had been taken up by his jacket and put bodily out of the Sunday-school . Disgruntled Christian Scientists usually went off and started a church of their own , and there were by this time almost as many " reformed " varieties of Christian Science as there were dissenters . Mrs. Gestefeld taught one kind in Chicago , Mrs. Crosse another kind in Boston , Frank Mason another in Brooklyn , Captain Sabin was soon to teach another in Washington , while nearly all the students who had quarreled with Mrs. Eddy or broken away from her were teaching or practising some variety of mindcure . Mrs. Woodbury , accordingly , hired a hall ? this seemed to be the only necessary preliminary in those days ? and started a church of her own , to which her little flock followed her . In the Legion of Honor rooms she conducted services every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes she read a poem . When it was impossible for her to be there , her daughter , Gwendolyn , supplied her pulpit . Mr. Woodbury was a faithful attendant of the church which the ladies of his family conducted . In 1897 Mrs. Woodbury published a veiled account of her differences with Mrs. Eddy in a pamphlet modestly entitled " War in Heaven . " In this book her criticism of Mrs. Eddy is courteous and respectful enough to suggest that she may still have hoped for reinstatement . But Mrs. Eddy had by this time become convinced that never , since the days of Kennedy , had there been such a mesmerist as Mrs. Woodbury . Indeed , Mrs. Eddy was not alone in accrediting Mrs. Woodbury with a strange hypnotic power . Some of Mrs. Woodbury 's own students were confident that if they displeased her she had power to bring upon them sickness , insanity , and disaster . They whispered tales about Robert W. Rowe , of Augusta , Maine , who had disobeyed and died . Whether Mrs. Eddy really believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether she saw that Mrs. Woodbury 's adventurous temperament would certainly bring ridicule upon Christian Science , Mrs. Eddy was determined to be rid of her , and lost no opportunity to discredit her . The two women had it back and forth for several years , charging each other with every sort of iniquity . In April , 1899 , Mrs. Woodbury published in the American Register , Paris , a poem which attacked Christian Science and which ended with these significant lines : Is the Dame that seemed august A Doll stuffed with sawdust , And must we believe that the Doll stuffed herself ? Mrs. Woodbury finally crossed the Rubicon by publishing in the Arena , May , 1899 , an exposure of Mrs. Eddy and her methods . Mrs. Woodbury 's Expose of Mrs. Eddy In this attack Mrs. Woodbury satirically touched upon Mrs. Eddy 's conviction that she is the starcrowned woman of the Apocalypse , and then took up the Quimby controversy , producing Mrs. Eddy 's early letters and newspaper con-  |p711  tributions as evidence that she got her theory of mind-cure from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health " ; ridiculed the Mother Room ; insinuated that Mrs. Eddy had illegally conferred degrees , and had been compelled to close her college for that reason ; accused her of an inordinate greed for money and of " trafficking in the temple . " She declared that Mrs. Eddy had been a medium , and that she was the victim of demonophobia ? the fear of witchcraft . Mrs. Woodbury stated that Mrs. Eddy claimed that she had cured the Prince of Vales , now King Edward VII. , of his serious illness in 1871 , and that to do so she had treated him through his royal mother , as the Prince 's life had been so immoral that she could not approach him directly . According to Mrs. Woodbury , Mrs. Eddy said that she treated President Garfield after he was shot , and would have succeeded in saving his life had not Kennedy and Arens maliciously interfered to prevent her from making this convincing demonstration . It seems that in this article Mrs. Woodbury wished to explain how she had been led to make such extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She asserts that Mrs. Eddy taught her women students that they might become mothers by a supreme effort of their own minds , and that girls were terrified by the doctrine that they might be made pregnant through the influence of demons . Mrs. Woodbury had probably repented her own effort to give a concrete example of Mrs. Eddy 's theory of " mental generation , " and she attacks her on this point with peculiar bitterness . She quotes the lei -- lowing passage from " Science and Health " " The propagation of their species without the male element , by butterfly , bee , and moth , is a discovery corroborative of the Science of Mind , because it shows that the origin and continuance of these insects rest on Principle , apart from material conditions . " * " An egg never was the origin of a man , and no seed ever produced a plant . . . . The belief that life can be in matter , or soul in body ' , and that man springs from dust or from an egg , is the brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows not because of seed or soil . " Commenting upon this passage , Mrs. Woodbury says : " To what diabolical conclusions do such deductions lead ? One may well hesitate to touch this delicate topic in print , yet only thus can the immoral possibilities and the utter lack of Divine inspiration in Christian Science ' be shown . " The substance of certain instruction given by Mrs. Eddy in private is as follows- . " If Jesus was divinely conceived by the Holy Ghost , or Spirit , without a human father , Mary not having known her husband , ? then women may become mothers by a supreme effort of their own minds , or through the influence upon them of an Unholy Ghost , a malign spirit . Women of unquestioned integrity , who have been Mrs. Eddy 's students , testify that she has so taught , and that by this teaching families have been broken up ; that thus maidens have been terrified out of their wits , and stimulated into a frenzy resembling that of deluded French nuns , who believed themselves brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridegroom of his church . Whatever her denials may be , such was Mrs. Eddy 's teaching while in her college ; to which she added the oracular declaration that it lay within her power to dissolve such motherhood by a wave of her celestial rod . " The selfish celibacy of nuns and clergy , Christian or heathen , with consequent ecclesiastical interference in family life , have been , and are , mischief-breeding blunders , fatal alike to morals and health . One result of this interference on the part of Mrs. Eddy is that Christian Science families are notably childless . " Mrs. Woodbury closed her article with the following denunciation : " Very tenacious is she of the paradoxical title carved on her Boston church , The Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science . ' Surely a Discoverer ' can not be the Founder ' of that which he has been under the necessity of dis covering ; while a Founder ' would have no need of discovering her own foundation . What she has really discovered ' are ways and means of perverting and prostituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the moral and physical depravity of her dupes . As she received this science from Dr. Quimby , it meant simply the healing of bodily ills through a lively reliance on the wholeness and order of the Infinite Mind , as clearly perceived and practically demonstrated by a simple and modest love of one 's kind . What she has founded ' is a commercial system , monumental in its proportions , but already tottering to its fall . " " The Babylonish Woman " This , certainly , was strong language from one who had taught Christian Science for ten years , who had often been compared to John , the beloved disciple , and who had leaned upon the  |p712  bosom of her Teacher . Mrs. Woodbury 's article appeared the 1st of May , and during that same month her husband , Frank Woodbury , died . This , to many of Mrs. Eddy 's faithful retainers , seemed like a direct judgment upon the apostate . Mrs. Woodbury might have known that Mrs. Eddy would have the last word , and that it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother Church , read before the congregation at the June communion service , a few weeks after Mr. Woodbury 's death , Mrs. Eddy said : " The doom of the Babylonish woman referred to in Revelation is being fulfilled . This woman , drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus , drunk of the wine of her fornication , would enter even the church , and retaining the heart of the harlot and the purpose of the destroying angel , pour wormwood into the waters ? the disturbed human mind ? to drown the strong swimmer struggling for the shore , aiming for Truth , and if possible poison such as drink of the living water ; but the recording angel , standing with right foot on the sea , and his left foot on the earth , has in his hand a book open , that uncovers and kills this mystery of iniquity , and interprets the mystery of godliness ; how the first is finished , and the second is no longer a mystery or miracle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a voice was heard , saying , Come out of her , my people , hearken not to her lies , that ye receive not her plagues , for her sins have reached unto heaven , and God hath remembered her iniquities . ' " Double unto her double , according to her works : In the cup which she hath filled , fill to her double , for she saith in her heart , I am no widow . Therefore shall her plague come in one day , death and mourning and famine , for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her . That which the Revelator saw in spiritual vision will be accomplished , the Babylonish woman is fallen . And who should mourn over the widow hood of lust , of her that hath become the habitation of devils , and the hold of every foul spirit , and the cage of every unclean bird ? " This vivid rhetoric Mrs. Woodbury and her friends believed referred directly to Mrs. Woodbury ; to her efforts to get back into the church ; to her alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The address was not only read aloud in the church , but was published in the Christian Science Sentinel and in the Boston Herald . Mrs. Woodbury , accordingly , brought a suit for criminal libel against Mrs. Eddy , claiming that , although no name was mentioned in the address , every Christian Scientist at the June communion understood who was meant by the " Babylonish woman . " The case came to trial in the following June , when Boston was full of Christian Scientists who had come to attend the June communion . Mrs. Woodbury lost her suit because such Christian Scientists as were summoned as witnesses testified that they had not understood Mrs. Eddy 's denunciation of the Babylonish woman to refer to Mrs. Woodbury in particular . One of the witnesses , however , Mr. William G. Nixon , Mrs. Eddy 's former publisher , stated that he had understood . that by the " Babylonish woman " Mrs. Eddy meant Josephine Woodbury . During the trial . the court-room was crowded with Christian Scientists , and Mrs. Woodbury decided that they had effected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge and witnesses , and by " treating " them in Mrs. Eddy 's behalf . She , accordingly , would not permit an appeal , but abjured Christian Science and retired into private life . Her church was broken up ; her students scattered and grew cold ; her musicians and sweet singers returned to their instruments , her artists to their drawing-boards ; her vestals married and ceased communing with visions . The " War in Heaven " was over , and with Mrs. Woodbury 's defeat perished the romantic movement in Christian Science .
