txt Secretary Root i and Postmaster General Smith are as .. ! tounded at the avalanche of misstatement I appearing daily as given out on authority about the Cuban postal scandal , Storleal which have not the slightest foundation are published , not as rumors , but as facts , ' and the amazing part of it is that they could be readily discovered to be false bye'i the most casual inquiry at the War and Post Office Departments . The favorite 1 , theme of misstatement is the origin of the appointments of Rathbone , Neely , and Reeves . It has for several days been asserted am a positive fact that Mr. Rathbone was appointed by Secretary Alger , and that his appointment was recommended by Senator Hanna ; that Mr. Neely was appointed by the Postmaster General at the instance of Senator Fairbanks and Assistant Postmaster General Heath , and that Auditor Reeves was appointed at the instigation of the Post Office Department . The facts are these : Rathbone was not appointed by Alger ; he was not either recommended by Hanna or anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was Mr. Smith 's personal selection for the place . Names may have been suggested to Mr. Smith , but if so he disregarded them . Neely was not appointed by Postmaster General Smith , nor did Senator Fairbanks , Col. Heath , or anybody else recommend him to Mr. Smith . Rathbone appointed him . It is understood that he did so at the instance of Senator Fairbanks , but if so Fairbanks 's recommendation was made to Rathbone , and not to the Postmaster General . Reeves 's appointment was not dictated , suggested . or influenced in any way by anybody in the Post Office Department . He never was an employe of that department . At the time of his appointment he was in the office of the Auditor of the Treasury for the Post Office Department , which is an office of the Treasury , and not of the Post Office Department . The War Department asked the Treasury Department for the name of a good man for the place , and the matter was referred to the Auditor , who recommended Reeves . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly as possible on the merit system , considering that our civil service laws have not been extended to Cuba . Postmaster General Smith wanted somebody for Director General who had had great experience in postal affairs . and who had held high rank . No mere Postmaster would do . Rathbone had a fine record , and had been Fourth ' Assistant Postmaster General . He was selected as the best man for the place , though the officials now think that their confidence in him was misplaced . He was allowed a free hand in making his appointments , and selected Neely on Fairbanks 's recommendation . Neely was one of Fairbanks 's supporters in Indiana . Rathbone could have nothing to do with the appointment of Reeves . who was a Treasury official . His record was good . AIMED AT BIG ROBBERIES . Facts are coming to light which indicate that the conspirators aimed at higher things than small postal robberies . The ambitious scheme to make Rathbone Governor General and Reeves Auditor of Cuba was fostered and engineered chiefly by Neely . Apparently the conspirators disliked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to the credit of Gen. Brooke that , in spite of his inability to discover their proceedings , they were trying to embarrass him and prevent him from becoming Governor General . But their antipathy to Brooke was as nothing to their antipathy to Wood . Rathbone 's blindness to everything that was going on and his contentment with his magnificent pomp as Director General made him an Ideal Governor General in their eyes . Neely visited the United States last Summer and devoted himself energetically to working up a public opinion against the appointment of any military officer to the Governor Generalship . He did not mention the name of Rathbone , but everywhere he went he sowed hints that military governorship was becoming unbearable to the Cubans . He saw members of the Administration and explained his position to them , and he left a trail of hints in official and newspaper circles . all tending to show that a Military Governor would not do . At same time he exalted , by way of contrast , the magnificent work of the Director of Posts . The impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure and Rathbone was the only bright spot in the insular administration . After the ground had been thus prepared Rathbone came to the United States . He i brought with him the Rathbone boom foe Governor General . Wherever he went ' Rathbone paragraphs appeared in the ' newspapers , and it was always explained that Rathbone was not a candidate , but that the Cubans , weary of militate , administration , were demanding the appointment of Rathbone . The Rathbone - boom was made to rest entirely upon the basis of a Cuban demand . At the time veiled attacks upon Gen. Wood began to appear . It was now becoming evident that Brooke would not be made Civil Governor nor even retained long in the Military Governorship . Things began to tend toward Wood . It was obviously unsafe to attack Wood outright . on account of his immense popularity , but coincident with the appearance of the Rathbone boom in charge of Rathbone himself . hints that Wood was not the great success he seemed began to appear . They failed to produce the slightest effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to he on " the inside " of Cuban matters asserted privately at the time that these attacks all came from Rathbone , but not enough evidence of Rathbone 's motives was then at hand to warrant the publication of the fart . There was no doubt that the folk of Rathbone for Civil Governor came from Rathhone himself . although he always denied it . SENATOR PORAICER . MADE ; TTIREATS . At the time there were hints of big jobs behind the Civil Governorship scheme . Rumors were floating around of corporations which had immense plans on foot . and it was asserted by people who had been in Cuba and understood the situation there that the adoption of the civil Governorship plan would tnean the looting of Cuba on a tremeneous scale . The scheme appeared to be certain of success then , but it was crushed effectually- a few days before the opening of Congress by Senator Foraker , who laid what he knew before the Administration and threatened It with trouble in Congress unless the thing was dropped at once . Nothing was said against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Wood 's friends 1 ) .. lieved then . but were careful not to talk very loudly about their belief . that the people who were back of the scheme to exploit Cuba wanted Rathbone made Civil Governor because they relied On his blindness to official ? ? - doings. his inability to discover malfeasances , and his int wen , satisfaction with his own pomp as Director General , which would naturally be immensely increased it ' he became Governor . The developments in connection with the present scandal tend to fortify them in that belief . It was not saspected or suggested that Rathbone would be ** cognizant of any wrongdoing , but it was 1 ) 011,2744 that his official blindness woulud make him an Ideal tool for the conspirators . Had the scheme gone through Neely would have been in a position of , vastly greater power than he could hope to occupy as treasurer . It was stated to-day that the defalcation had been found to amount to *100,000 , but that enough could be recovered from Neely to reduce the Government 's loss to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who declared that there was nothing as yet to show what the defalcation amounted to .
