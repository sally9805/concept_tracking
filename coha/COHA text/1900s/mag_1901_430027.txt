 | THE federal union of all the colonies occupying the great southland which we call Australia is an event of much greater importance to the world at large than many people may at the first glance be inclined to suppose . The great events of history , indeed , are too apt to be connected , in men 's minds , with wars , invasions , and violent changes in the political situation of nations ; and yet , as a rule , the very greatest changes in the history of human society have little to do with such events . It may perhaps be considered a sign of the times that , of all the important political changes likely to be of wide interest and importance to the world , this latest federation of states has been the outcome of the least violent pressure from without or within of any that history records . In every other case in which self-governing states have consented to give up their powers of absolute self - government in exchange for a larger political life , there has been an element of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the apprehension of such danger in the future . No such consideration has had any discoverable part in bringing about the federation of the British colonies of Australia , which takes effect on the first day of the twentieth century . Too distant from any of the world 's civilized and aggressive powers to fear invasion ; too confident in themselves and their British connection to feel any apprehension as to their future , ? the people of Australia have deliberately elected to become one great people , owning a whole continent , under the impression that a position so unique must carry with it hereafter no common advantages and influence . This action of the people of Australia has been exceedingly calm and deliberate . Eight years in all have been consumed in dealing with the change ? from the time when the first formal convention sat to devise a constitution that might command the assent of all the six colonies , as the basis of a union , to the day when the last of the six accepted , by an overwhelming vote of its people , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The constitution has been discussed and rediscussed by the people of the various colonies , and amended and reamended by their delegates , until at last it has taken the form of the most democratic constitution in force in any part of the world at this moment . Such facts as these alone would entitle the event of the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia to special interest among all free peoples ; but there are other reasons that lend additional interest to the new departure . These arise partly from the position and prospects of the new federation itself ; partly also from the situation of Great Britain at this time , and the probable influence which the commonwealth may have on her future policy and national development . The influence likely to be exerted by any part of an empire ? even of an empire so strangely constituted , and apparently so loosely linked together , as that of Great Britain now is ? must depend on many things ; but it will certainly be in a great degree limited by the wealth and commercial vigor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should be interesting at this time to form some estimate of what these are likely to be in the case of Australia . A WEALTHY PEOPLE . The colonies of Australia , though a very young , are a very wealthy community . The really active existence as a free community of the very oldest of them all does not yet exceed sixty years ; their career of self-government , which has also been that of their success , has in no single case yet extended over half a century . England , warned by past experience in the case of this country , made haste to divide her great territonal acquisition of the continent of the southern ocean between the . young communities of her own children that had undertaken the gigantic task of developing it , and they one and all have proved themselves fully equal to the task . The development of America during the last halfcentury has been marvelous ; but though less known , and less widely appreciated , that of Australia has been no less wonderful . The first difficulty which her people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other countries likely to afford markets for their goods , or to supply freely the much - needed additions to their numbers . A voyage to Australia was one then requiring four months for its completion , and demanding  | an expenditure of money within the reach only of classes that were not too numerous in England ; and thus no rush of population , such as that which swept across the Atlantic between 1850 and the end of the century , could possibly have taken place . And yet , in spite of distance and expense , the increase of population in Australia during the last fifty years has been without precedent in any country except the United States of America . In 1850 there were in the whole of Australia , including within it then , as now , the island of Tasmania , not more than 400,000 whites ; to-day there are , according to official caculation , which can not be far wrong , as nearly as possible 4,000,000 inhabitants ? or ten times as many . The explanation of so remarkable an increase of population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration were so great is to be found in its prosperity . It was the great reported prosperity of this country that set open the floodgates of European emigration , and led millions of emigrants to cross the Atlantic in search of the wellbeing and comfort they could not hope to find at home ; it was the same cause that led to the emigration to Australia of many thousands ? chiefly of a different class of people from those who selected America as their new home . The great gold discoveries , indeed , were the means of bringing a population similar in many respects to that which came to California ; but since 1860 no influx of that kind has taken place . As a rule , the people who have selected Australia for their new home have been those who had some little capital ; and it may well be that it is owing to this fact that the wealth of the country has increased with the startling rapidity and to the remarkable extent to which it has increased during the period . SHEEP AND CATTLE INTERESTS The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had early been discovered that her more temperate districts would grow a class of wool finer and more valuable than any other known ; and the discovery that the interior of the continent consisted mainly of vast grassy plains seemed to point out the future destiny of the country as a pastoral one . Subsequent discoveries have gone far to correct such an impression ; and yet the fact remains that much of the wealth of the new commonwealth is still dependent on its pastoral industries , and is likely , to a certain extent , to continue so in future . At present , Australia is the most important woolproducing country in the world . In spite of three years of perhaps the most destructive drought ever yet known in the country , which has just come to an end , there are not less than 112,000,000 sheep pastured on the great plains of the south and east , and not less than 14,000,000 cattle , chiefly in the more northern districts . About one-fourth part of all the world 's crop of wool is grown from the sheep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nearly , if not quite , one-third of the value . Like all other products of the kind , the price of wool varies from year to year ; but the average value of the wool crop of Australia has not during the last ten years been less than $120,000,000 . With the other pastoral products , both of sheep and cattle , the wealth derived from her pastoral pursuits is certainly not less than $200 , 000 , 000 each year ? a sum which is equivalent to $50 for each of her people . MINERAL AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES . The wealth of Australia , however , is by no means , as was at first supposed , likely to be confined to her sheep and cattle .. Little is known as yet of great districts covering many thousands of square miles of the interior ; but in the districts nearest the coast , the discoveries of the last twenty-five years lead to the conclusion that no part of the world is richer in minerals of every kind useful to man than Australia . Of gold , she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's greatest producers ; and even now her export yearly amounts to not less than $60 , 000 , - 000 in value . But later discoveries have shown that even gold will not hereafter be the greatest of the sources of Australia 's mineral wealth . Vast deposits of coal have already been traced over districts extending many thousands of square miles , both in the eastern and western districts of the continent . Lodes of silver of almost unparalleled richness have been worked , already yielding more than $160,000,000 worth of the metal , with a present annual production of about oneninth part of the total yield from the silver mines of the globe . Copper and tin , lead and antimony , iron and quicksilver , have been found in many parts of the country , and are worked already in a few , with results that indicate how vast the mineral production of the continent will be hereafter , when its people are able to grapple with the greatness of its concealed wealth . Last year the value of the mineral products exported from Australia , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100,000,000 ? or $25 for every inhabitant . The Pacific continent is not as yet a great agricultural country ; and yet its people not only supply their own wants , but export grain and meat , cheese and butter , to the markets of  | Europe . The wines of Australia are rapidly gaining recognition in England and on the continent of Europe as something both new and valuable ; she already supplies herself and New Zealand with nearly all the sugar required for their own people , and the culture and manufacture of tobacco are extending sufficiently fast to show that before many years Australian tobacco will have to be reckoned with in the world 's markets . More , even , than this might be said of the wealth of this comparatively unknown continent , if space would permit . We might speak of her diamonds , of which already 150,000 carats have been exported ; of her rubies , emeralds , opals , and other precious stones , which have been found in many places , and are beginning to be sought for in a few ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement with which we set out ? that the people of Australia are prosperous , and their country one which is among the most attractive on the globe to persons in search of a land where they and their children may secure comfort and wellbeing . This fact would of itself justify the assertion that the consolidation into a single nation of all the states occupying the continent is an event of large importance to the world ; but it is only one of the grounds on which the statement is made . As six colonies , the states of A ustralia might , indeed , be good places to live in ,  - -  they might enjoy much prosperity also ; but for many years to come they could not hope to enjoy any wide influence at a distance from their own shores . United , it is not difficult to see how they may . BRITAIN 'S COLONIAL EXPANSION . In this age of the world 's development two things appear to be chiefly essential to secure the great influence of any people on the affairs of their neighbors and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth combined with a commercial activity such as brings them into contact with other nations , and the strength and determination of character which assure the world that they are able and willing , if need be , to protect their interests if unjustly assailed . During most of the century just ended , Great Britain has occupied a position among the nations in both these respects which was almost unique . Her wealth was so greatly in advance of that of all the continental nations of Europe that all of them were largely her customers and generally her debtors ; and her readiness to defend her own interests at the first sign of attack was notorious , and was backed by resources wholly unequaled by other nations . The march of events , and the wonderful developments of the century , have largely altered the position . Other nations have grown wealthy ; others have learned to compete with Britain in the world 's markets , as well as to supply their own wants ; others not only exceed her greatly in population now , but still more in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new situation has supplied a new problem for the people of England . It is certain that she can not hope in the twentieth century to occupy the place she has occupied in the nineteenth , unless she too can develop great powers of expansion among her own people . She has acquired enormous possessions , it is true ; but these will not by any means necessarily meet the case . It is even possible that they might prove only a source of weakness , because they offer a temptation to the cupidity of other nations . For strength in commerce , as for strength in possible war , Great Britain can only rely on a real expansion of her own people ? one with herself , in as close a sympathy and alliance as may be found possible , while occupying territory large enough and rich enough to give scope for an increase as great or greater than that of any possible rival . For such an expansion England can look only to her colonies . In them , if the other conditions exist , she certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find a wealth her , for a variety of reasons . It is apparently possessed of the greatest room for profitable expansion ; it is certainly at present possessed of the greatest amount of wealth , and gives the greatest promise both of wealth and population in the near future . It is also entirely British in population ? a feature possessed only by its near neighbor , New Zealand , besides , among all the great colonies of England . Canada , indeed , is great- and prosperous , and at present she is loyal to the British connection ; but most of her vast territory can at best only be slowly reclaimed , and one-half of her people have no natural racial sympathy with England . The prospect in South Africa is still less favorable . There may , indeed , be a healing of sores and a blending of elements in a South African federation hereafter ; but it will be long before the past is forgotten ? and even if it were , there is scarcely a hope that British blood and British ideas and sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war not yet fully ended in South Africa has served to point this moral so clearly that its true significance can hardly be lost sight of . To that war South Africa has contributed many soldiers ; but they have represented less , by far .  | than half her people of European origin , while they have been balanced by more than as many who volunteered , probably with still greater enthusiasm , to fight against England . Canada sent gallant volunteers to South Africa in sufficient numbers to be of substantial assistance ; but it can not be for an instant contended that it was the spontaneous action of the whole people , or that there were not many jarring notes of dissent audible to those who cared to listen . From Australia and New Zealand alone there came no divided response to England 's appeal , and no jarring note from first to last in the enthusiasm with which their people threw themselves into and gave their money to the cause . They did not wait to be asked for their assistance , but accepted England 's quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many volunteers to the front as Canada did ; and they assured the mother country of their readiness to send more , should more be needed . In this there was nothing remarkable , after all ; the people of Australia and those of Great Britain are one people . They are one in language , laws , sentiments , and feeling , with no admixture of alien blood , and not one memory of injustice or self-seeking on the part of England , to divide them . AUSTRALIA 'S TRADE RELATIONS WITH ENGLAND . And in commercial relations the same is true ; in New Zealand still more than in Australia , indeed , but very markedly in both . If England 's commerce and trade are still to expand in the future , it will be largely by the assistance of her children in the South Pacific . Trade may follow the flag , it is true , for a time ; but it needs something more than any mere symbol of authority to retain it . Circumstances are all in favor of such a retention in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all that she produces ; and in return she buys from England more than twice as much as South Africa , and nearly four times as much in each year as the Dominion of Canada . The wool , the metals , the frozen meat , and the surplus agricultural products of Australia go mainly to England , and these Constitute year by year an increasing percentage of all that she imports . Already they greatly exceed in value the products from any other of her great possessions , even India falling short last year by $25,000,000 . In that year Australia 's total trade with Great Britain was almost equal to that of either France or Germany , and greatly exceeded that of any other nation of Europe , while it was largely exceeded only by that of the United States . Thus it would be no easy matter to overestimate the value to England of the new commonwealth as a support either in peace or war in the century which has opened with her federation . Her people , if not yet very numerous as nations are reckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already wealthy far beyond the experience of other nations in proportion to their numbers , and they possess a country which gives the promise of enormous expansion in riches . They are not only a people of her own race , ? they are her own people , bound to her by every tie that can bind together the locally separated portions of the same nation . They have already shown their willingness to regard her quarrels as their own , even when they have had no direct influence on the policy that led to the quarrel , and have freely spent both their money and their lives to maintain the supremacy of the empire . To some extent this has been a new discovery to England herself . She knew , of course , that her Australian colonies were most friendly ; she knew that they were closely united with her in the relations of commerce ; but she has only now become fully aware that in them she may find the true expansion of her people and her country , and one sufficiently ample for future needs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inevitably be great , although it will not at first be pronounced . It will be seen in all that takes place in the South Pacific , and it may ere long make itself felt even farther from home , The new commonwealth , it will be found , will not be too modest in suggestions in any matter that affects its own interests , and its ideas on the subject of its interests will expand . The result will be inevitable before many years of the twentieth century have passed , ? England must find a way of taking into formal and administrative partnership the people already one with her in the partnership of sentiment and interests . THE COMMONWEALTH AS A WORLD POWER . It is in this way that the Commonwealth of Australia is most certainly destined to become a world influence in the early future . Through her , and probably through her alone , can the knotty problem of a British imperial federation be solved ; because between her and England , alone of her possessions of the first magnitude , there exist a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be worked out , by what steps it will be reached and the difficulties in its way overcome , it would be rash to prophesy as yet . Two things , however , may be regarded as morally certain even now with respect to it : when accomplished , it will open up a new career to the British people , and that career is likely to be of no little service to civilization and humanity .
