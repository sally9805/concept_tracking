President Roosevelt 's first message is not so long by several columns as President McKinley 's last one , yet we can not help thinking that it is too long . Except in a few particulars it is lacking in definite recommendations , but these few are of first-rate importance . Rumors have been flying around ever since Mr. McKinley 's death that the new President would make some decisive expression of his views about the industrial combinations called Trusts . Latterly it has been given out that he would recommend that steps be taken by Congress to compel publicity of the financial affairs of all such combinations . This he has done He has made a very fair statement of the reasons for this requirement . " What further remedies are needed in the way of Governmental regulation or taxation , " he adds , " can only be determined after publicity has been obtained by process of law and in the course of administration " The word " taxation " as here used brings to mind the fact that Mr. Roosevelt , as Governor of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he said in one of his messages to the State Legislature that if all other remedies for Trusts and combines failed , that of taxation remained . There is no other word half so dreadful to the promoters of Trusts as taxation , because that is something which they can not buy off . When the public mind is once fixed upon it , lobbyists and party bosses are powerless to divert the Legislature from it . This was conclusively shown in the fight at Albany , and we can not doubt that the President had that fight fresh in mind when he wrote the message now before us . Another recommendation in which the President 's positive character shows itself is that relating to civil-service reform Here he is on familiar ground and his footing is sure He says that the merit system is the true American system , since it is the one which gives a fair field and no favor to each candidate for the public service He declares that the gain to the Government by the introduction of this system in the clerical service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been immense He recommends that the classified service be extended to the District of Columbia , but most of all should it be applied rigidly to the Philippines and Porto Rico " The administration of these islands , " he maintains , " should be as free from the suspicion of partisan politics as the administration of the army and navy . " The consular service should be brought under the same regulation . The President recommends the passage of a law for this purpose , in accordance with the wishes expressed by many commercial bodies throughout the country . All this is worthy of Theodore Roosevelt at his best . As instances of vagueness in the message , we may mention the paragraph which relates to reciprocity and the one in reference to ship subsidies As regards the former , we are advised that " reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection " Does that convey any idea to an expectant Congress ? It conveys none to us . Nor are we helped by being told that reciprocity should be sought for so far as it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the well-being of the wage-worker is the prime consideration it our entire policy of economic legislation Obviously somebody must decide what constitutes an injury to our home industries , and how the well-being of the wage-workers as a whole is to be promoted . The Department of State has been working on these two problems for the better part of two years , with the approval of the late President McKinley . Its labors are embodied in concrete form in a series of treaties which President McKinley had specifically recommended to the Senate for ratification . All that President Roosevelt says on this point is . " I ask the attention of the Senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor . " This is certainly vague . In regard to ship subsidies , there is a similar vagueness . Much is said in a general way about the need of restoring our merchant marine . We are told that many of the fast foreign steamships are subsidized , and that the original cost of American ships is greater than that of foreign ones Finally it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequalities How this should be done we are not told , nor is even a hint given For all practical purposes this part of the message might as well have been omitted . Civil-service reformers had last week a special cause for thanksgiving in the present which they received from Mr. Roosevelt The President has issued an order amending one of the rules so that hereafter , whenever an Indian agency is discontinued through the devolving of its duties upon the bonded superintendent of the local Indian training school , the agent who thus loses his place may be admitted to the classified service upon such tests of fitness as the Civil-Service Commission may prescribe , and receive such designation as the Secretary of the Interior may direct . The transformation of the Indian service through the merging of the former agent 's duties in those of the school superintendent is steadily going on , the change havink been successfully made in a score of cases . The superintendents are within the classified service , to which the competitive system applies , and the President 's new order will bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules . This order is not only in itself a valuable extension of the merit system , but is far more important as an earnest of what civil-service reformers may expect in future from the new President . Mr. Roosevelt has proved his attachment to the principles of the reform , and he has an understanding of the system such as no previous Executive has possessed , by reason of his experience as one of the Civil-Service Commissioners under both Harrison and Cleveland . Moreover , he has plenty of courage to carry through any extensions of the competitive system which he may deem wise . The discretionary power of the President under the Civil-Service Law is very great , and the nation is already assured that Mr Roosevelt will employ it to the public advantage It is said that the Hon. William M. Jenkins , Governor of Oklahoma , is very much surprised that he should be removed from office on a charge of receiving shares in a corporation to which he had officially awarded a valuable contract It seems that he turned these shares over to certain persons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see nothing objectionable in such a transaction , although he said that he could not pay such an obligation by an appointment to office , " or anything of that kind " This is a reversal of the common practice which ought not to escape the notice of Mark Twain or " Mr. Dooley . " Nine Governors or Senators out of ten who had incurred political obligations would consider themselves perfectly justified in getting an office for the obliger . No matter how great or small the obligation or the office might have been , the course of procedure would have passed without special notice or comment A payment in cash at the expense of the taxpayers is quite a different matter In the eyes of President Roosevelt it discloses " such an entire lack of appreciation of the high fiduciary nature of the duties of his office as to unfit him Gov . Jenkins for their further discharge , " and in this view decent public opinion will concur It adds something to the op-probrium of the transaction that the - Governor awarded the contract . ' Secretary Root 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of officers is most comprehensive Besides the Military Academy at West Point , and in addition to the elementary schools for officers which should be maintained at each military post , Secretary Root recommends the establishment of five special service schools , for artillery , engineering , submarine defence , cavalry and field artillery , and medicine , respectively He would have in addition a General Service and Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas Finally , a War College at Washington would give the highest instruction in military science to properly qualified officers , and would direct the policy of the special and general service schools These schools Mr Root would throw open to all persons who are fitted to profit by their instruction Thus the elementary schools at the military posts and the General Service and Staff College would be open to officers of the National Guard , former officers of Volunteers , and graduates of accredited military schools All such persons , by proving that they were properly qualified , might attend also the special service schools The significance of this comprehensive plan far transcends the education of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students who should avail themselves of the privileges of the military schools , classified lists would be made up , so that in case of emergency there would be an abundant supply of company officers If the volunteer commissions were confined to such lists , we should be spared for the future such exhibitions of official incompetence as made the volunteers in the Spanish war ? with honorable exceptions  --  almost a negligible quantity In similar fashion , and consistently with Secretary Root 's whole attitude towards army reform , a merit list of regular officers would be kept , on the basis of which staff and special appointments would be made This is a measure of the first importance , and ought to mark the end of the favoritism and routine promotions which threaten to sap the spirit of the army Henceforth an officer must do something more than survive , and in the army as elsewhere a career is opened to talent Secretary Root 's recommendation that the lands now belonging to the friars in the Philippine Islands be purchased by the Government and reallotted under proper conditions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monastic holdings , the existence of which has been an immemorial grievance in the islands Of course , this expropriation could come about only by purchase , for the Treaty of Paris confirms all the privileges and rights which the friars enjo ) - ed under Spanish rule It is equally Just that the purchase price of these 403,000 acres should be charged , not upon the Philippine Islands , but upon the United States The right administration of these public lands could not fail to be a potent contribution towards conciliation . Commissioner Taft and Secretary Root have advocated an equitable settlement of this vexatious matter without temporizing Congress should see that their recommendations are promptly carried into effect We fear that the Cuban delegates in Washington are doomed to bitter disappointment in their expectations of an early reduction of the duty on sugar , either by way of reciprocity or otherwise They have assumed that whatever the executive branch of the Government favors , especially in the matter of foi eign policy , is sure to he adopted They have never had experience of any diffeient kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative and the executive branches may be at cross-purposes when both are emit oiled by the same party  --  a condition of things by no means unusual in this favored land Now it appears that Congressmen Grosvenor of Ohio and Payne of New York , two of the most influential men in Congress , the latter the probable Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means , are opposed to any reduction of the duty on sugar , by treaty or otherwise They will insist that the full protection accorded our producers of sugar from both beets and cane shall be continued If the Republicans in Congress take this attitude in conflict with that of the President and the Secretary of War , they may raise a new issue in American politics If no concession is made to the Cubans on the sugar question by reciprocity or otherwise , there will forthwith be a strong movement In Cuba for annexation , and this movement will extend itself to the United States , and political parties will have to align themselves in reference to it The way to stave off annexation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties on both sugar and tobacco Mr Ridgely 's report to Congress is very much the traditional document expected from the Comptroller of the Currency He renews the stock recommendations of his predecessors relative to greater safeguards for Vie business of banking , offers the usual comments on the defects of the Sub-Treasury system , and calls the attention of Congress to the necessity of extending the twenty-year charters of the banks , soon to expire About the much-discussed question of the standard of value he has only a bare hint that , " if " the law of March 14 , 1900 , can be strengthened , such action ought to be taken before the matter " gets shoved to one side . " On the freer issue of banknotes , he suggests that safe middle ground between the views of extremists may he found , and that progress toward more liberal legislation should be slow An emergency circulation , based on commercial assets , is practically all he can recommend for the present , but that 13 a large advance upon the views of his predecessor In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mai ch 14 , 1900 , as giving " new impetus to the national banking system " There is little in the figures to prove that the national system has been made more useful to the classes and sections supposed to he aided by the act of last year Of the 742 new banks chartered since March 14 , 1900 , more have been organized in the Middle States than in any other geographical division , although the law was specially designed to promote the organization of banks in the West and South Moreover , many of the new institutions are of large capital ? a fact which shows that they are in the cities rather than in the rural communities where it had been supposed they were chiefly needed Finally , the new banks have issued only a comparatively small proportion of the curl ency to which they are entitled How to tax franchise values seems to be a problem of growing public interest The question is now most prominently up for discussion in New York , New Jersey , Ohio , and Illinois , but it Is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Ohio has granted Mayor Johnson 's motion for leave to file a petition asking the court to determine the powers of the State Board of Equalization If Mr Johnson 's plan should be adopted , the Board would reassess the property of railways on the basis of the market value of their securities . What the feelings of railway managers would be may be gathered from expressions of opinion in Chicago and Newark In the former city , the traction companies maintain that utter ruin would result from the taxation of their franchises on the basis of market value , and very much the same cry comes from New Jersey . It is , of course , impossible to predict the decisions of the courts in the cases now before them , and too much weight should not be given to the protests of counsel : or the companies , but at least one good result of the agitation may be expected : it should help on the movement for greater publicity of corporate accounts , and thus ultimately lead to sounder methods of taxing corporate incomes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Superintendent of the State Department of Public Works , is to be his Police Commissioner , fulfils public expectation and will command public approval . For a fortnight past his name has been the only one which appeared to be under serious consideration for this important position , and during the whole discussion not an objection to his fitness for the place has been raised The first thing which the Police Department needs is the application of military discipline by a man who knows by personal experience what such discipline is This rendered it important that the new Commissioner should be a man who has had something to do with the command of troops Col. Partridge served for more than three years in the Union army during the civil war , rising from first lieutenant to captain in a regiment of Massachusetts volunteers . A few years later he became lieutenant of a company in the Twenty-third ( Brooklyn ) Regiment of the National Guard of this State , and was promoted by successive steps to the colonelcy . In this capacity he commanded the regiment when it was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's strike in 1892 . For the first two of Mr. Low 's four years as Mayor of Brooklyn Col. Partridge was Commissioner of the Fire Department , and he was then made head of the Police Department , so that he has already once filled practically , on a smaller scale , the same place that he is now to occupy . It is safe to say that no other citizen of New York has a better comprehension of the questions with which Mr. Low 's Police Commissioner will have to deal . President-elect Cantor of Manhattan Borough has applied the same standards of selection in his first appointment which led the Mayor-elect to name George L Rives for Corporation Counsel and Col. John N. Partridge for Police Commissioner . Under the revised charter the place of Superintendent of Buildings in this borough is to be one of the most important offices in the whole city , and Mr. Cantor will fill it with a man who is in every way exceptionally well qualified Mr. Perez M Stewart knows all about the work of contractors and builders by practical experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has demonstrated the independence which the Superintendent of Buildings should possess . A better selection for the place could not be made . Not less welcome is the further announcement that Mr. William Martin Aiken is to become Consulting Architect for Manhattan Borough Almost any change from Horgan &; Slattery would be grateful , but this selection is peculiarly acceptable to all who are ambitious that our civic building should be worthy of a great city For Mr Aiken is not only an accomplished architect , but a skilled organizer , as his conduct of the Supervising Architect 's Office at Washington , which was virtually his creation , has amply proved He will have the opportunity of setting a precedent which no future administi ation will dare wholly to disregard We believe that the enlightened taste of this city can never again receive so gratuitous an insult as was dealt in the appointment of the present Tammany ar-chitects The Manitoba Prohibition Act of July 4 , 1900 , which was recently declared unconstitutional by the highest court , differed from ordinary prohibitory legislation in being an attempt not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent its use . This intention was expressed in the preamble , which In terms prohibited " all use in Manitoba of spirituous , fermented , malt , and all intoxicating liquors as beverages or otherwise than for sacramental , medicinal , mechanical , or scientific purposes " Quite in the spirit of this preamble was a clause which forbade even the giving away of liquor which had been lawfully acquired by the owner Under the act , clubs would have been restrained from supplying liquor to their members The Court of King 's I3ench of Manitoba declared that the act exceeded the powers of the Manitoba Legislature ; that the attempt to suppress a legal traffic had no sufficient precedent , and that all excise legislation of so sweeping a character as to affect the general trade relations of the Dominion fell under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Parliament On appeal to the Privy Council , the decision of the lower court was reversed , and the act declared Constitutional The decision gives the Canadian provinces the fullest powers to prohibit liquor-selling , and since the Premier of Ontario is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation may become a prominent political issue in the near future . It should not be forgotten that the real test of the Manitoba act is to come That the courts declare it legal does not prove that it is not ill-advised The experience of many of our own States with less drastic laws shows that men are perfectly willing to vote for a system under which they absolutely refuse to live Hence the experience of Manitoba can hardly be more fortunate than that of Kansas or Maine Monday 's debate at the Pan-American Conference , now sitting in the City of Mexico , showed but too plainly that no more contentious matter can be brought before an international conference than the suggestion that the conferees settle their disputes amicably The mere mention of a comprehensive scheme of arbitration aroused the most violent protest from a Chilian. delegate Such an attitude indicates that to touch upon really important issues would threaten the disintegration of the Conference Chili , it will be remembered , joined in the Mexico meeting only upon the assurance that no plan of arbitration should apply to disputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American problems which most urgently require adjustment ; namely , the boundary disputes between herself and Argentina , Bolivia , and Peru That Chili would utterly oppose any and all plans for arbitration was hardly to be anticipated , and perhaps Senor Martinez 's outburst on Monday should not be given so large a significance However that may be , the Mexico Conference seems to be going the usual way The decrease in the bullion value of the rupee , which has caused so much suffering in India , seems likely to prove of unexpected advantage to certain American importers Section 25 of the tariff act of 1894 provides that the pure metallic value of foreign coins , as determined by the Director of the Mint , shall be used as the basis for assessing the importing values of goods whose worth is stated in terms of those coins Secretary Gage , however , some time ago ordered that the rupee be converted into American money by reference to its exchange value He has now been reversed by the Board of General Appraisers , which orders that the rupee be converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from India may profit by this verdict becomes apparent when it is noted that the pure metallic value of the rupee is about 20 cents , as compared with an exchange value of 32 cents or more This curious disparity is a result of the anomalous condition of the Indian currency system In 1893 the Indian mints were closed to the free coinage of silver , and British gold coins were ordered received by the public treasuries at the rate of 15 rupees to the pound sterling In 1899 gold coins were made a legal tender at this same valuation , but the silver rupee continued as additional legal tender to an unlimited amount The position of the rupee is therefore that of an unlimited legal-tender coin whose issue has been discontinued , and its international value , like that of our own silver dollar , depends not on its fine content , but upon the gold par of exchange The New York importers who will profit by the late decision are merely taking frLIk advantage of a defect in our existing legislation .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
