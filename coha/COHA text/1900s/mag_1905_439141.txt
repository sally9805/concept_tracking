FIFTY years ago Charles Street was still fashionable . Now it is impossible . Then it signified peace and position . Now teamsters and the trolley rumble and jangle in undisputed possession . It was once , for Boston , a broad , quiet street which people loved on account of its proximity to the water . Especially were the houses on the west side preferred . There , behind plain brick fronts many a rich family lived a placid and luxurious existence . Some of those houses are left to-day , islands in the ocean of a roaring trade . Their occupants might be called prisoners of the past , marooned by tradition , memory , or habit , into inherited homes . One of these mansions , whose back may be said to front on the Charles River Basin , had been the home of Nathaniel Morley of East India fame . The days of the old merchant princes have passed away , and have left behind them their priceless carved teak , imperial jade ornaments , silk brocades , and sandal-wood chests ; their descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these years the old Morley house had undergone no change . Vandals approached to its very walls ; vulgarities stared at it from the opposite side of the street ; but with a stately and almost grim rigidity it held its place , a feudal landmark , unmoved by the tinsel of the times . The only surviving members of the family were two daughters , who , like gray pigeons , held religiously to their home . The deep garden , unsuspected by casual passers-by , with its modern pergola and old-fashioned flowers , bordered by box , was the favorite resting-place of these two spinsters . There , in the gray-green spring , or in the bronze-red fall , they would sit , drinking their perfumed tea , looking out upon the broad expanse of water , and gently wondering sometimes about the ever changing world to the right of the Harvard Bridge . Isabel Morley was the elder of the two , and she must have been nearly fifty years of age . Her face was of the typical New England variety , stamped with refinement and pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray , beginning to blend into the color of her hair . Her mouth showed the lines of responsibility that are natural to a protector ; and her eyes the anxiety peculiar to a duenna . Indeed , this was not to be wondered at , for ever since she could remember she had been father and mother to her younger sister Madeleine . Isabel and Madeleine were different . Isabel was self-reliant ; Madeleine was clinging . Isabel was inclining to the stoutness that overtakes many of our New England women in middle life ; Madeleine was slender and girlish . Isabel still affected colors ; Madeleine always dressed in gray . Isabel looked at times something like a hawk ; Madeleine always like a wounded dove . Madeleine was as much shielded now from the rude contact of the world as she had been when die was a child . She was fifteen years younger than her sister , and was still treated as if she were the baby of the family . She was never allowed to go out into the street alone . The two sisters always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked Madeleine up in bed , kissed her goodnight , and then crept softly to her own room . For hours Isabel would sit watching her younger sister silently , her heart wrung by the look of sorrow that she saw . ? I'hen she would get up , stroke Madeleine tenderly on the shoulder as one might a laughter in suffering , and sit down without a word . The relationship between these two MIS as beautiful as it was inexplicable to what they called the common people . If there were any mystery in the family , which no one suspected , the girls had the good breeding to keep it to themselves . They never talked about their own affairs , nor by any accident did they allow themselves to be separated . It was a warm June afternoon when Miss Isabel Morley proposed to her sister to make a call on Beacon Street . The air was so soft that they decided not to use their brougham , but to walk instead . Madeleine had been pale and moody during the last few days , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly ; she looked like a beautiful gray dove . Her pearl-colored crime de Chine dress clung closely to her slender figure , making her look younger Than she was . She smiled up at Isabel , something mournfully , her blue eyes large with the promise to be as cheerful as she possibly could . With a sigh of relief at this silent assurance , Isabel opened the front door herself , and then shut it carefully . The air was warm and rich with life , and the two walked in it happily . They were not troubled that afternoon by the painful vulgarity of their surroundings , and yet they were glad when they reached Beacon Street and the green depth of the Common confronted them . " Just wait here a moment , dear , " said Isabel , stopping on the corner . " 1 want to order something I forgot to telephone for this morning . " She went into the druggist 's , leaving Madeleine standing on the sidewalk , entranced in the different shades of foliage opposite to her . So preoccupied was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her , and a clatter of feet . The sound came nearer , blending raucously with the rumble of the street . If she had turned , she would have seen the wild figure of a man leaping ahead of the pursuing crowd . But Madeleine stood absorbed , the unusual noises making no impression upon her . Suddenly she felt herself entangled in a horrible grip , ? she who had never been rudely touched before in her life . The pursued man , cooling to the corner , wished to turn . Seeing the woman standing there , he used her as a pivot , and after he had given her a half swing , he leaped beyond , up the street . But Madeleine did not know the reason of the assault . She felt the clutch upon her arm and waist . Her face was scorched with the hot breath upon it . She had the instant , maidenly consciousness of having been desecrated . The attack left her faint and quivering . She reeled to the side of the building , and stood there almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuers swept by her . Her delicate personality writhed . The horror of this invasion ! The disgrace of it ! Hearing the confusion , Isabel Morley ran out and found her sister half fainting . " Why , Madeleine ! " she cried . " There is blood all over your waist ! " " Oh ! Get me home , " sobbed Madeleine ; and then the woman swooned quite : may . There are some natures that were never meant to exist in this world at all , ? natures so delicately organized and exquisitely adjusted that they wilt at a touch , like a rare orchid . This is rather a quality of physical than of spiritual organization . Such souls are doomed to go through life finding but little harmony to accord with their own . Primitive feelings , and people who are composed as if by Wagner , strike terrible discords in these supersensitive hearts . Not being able to come into contact with life , they do not tolerate it . To these natures most human manners are vulgar , and all human follies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentary aberrations from truth they will not pardon . Contact with the world often becomes to them absolute physical pain . A rude touch is torture , and may be followed by a long period of depression . Curiously enough , these sensitive beings may not carry with them a perfection corresponding to their refinement . Culture is apt to preclude power , and often includes great selfishness . Madeleine Morley had lived an unnatural existence . She was the hothouse product of her sister , who had sheltered her as carefully as one protects palms from a New England winter . Like all conservatory plants , she was forced and self-centred . To transplant her into healthy soil and growth out of doors would kill her . She knew no other life than the tropic existence that she had lived on this bleak Massachusetts water front . Mentally dependent , physically repressed , and spiritually caged , for many years Madeleine had been a pale and willing prisoner . This was the first time that she had been spotted by the world , and she quivered with shame . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fever and depression . She could feel that man 's hands upon her . It seemed as if the bloody mark lie left upon her gray clothes could never be washed out of her mind . And then his face ! Gaunt , flushed , frightened , for an instant it had bent above her . The face shadowed her . It left her neither in her waking nor in her troubled sleep . It was threatening to become a fixed impression , mutilating her future . It would seem almost impossible that the mere shock of that unhappy contact could so shake even such a delicateperson . But there was something more . Madeleine had not dared to tell her sister all she felt or feared . That face which so persistently haunted her had , as it became permanently stamped on the retina of her brain , a strangely familiar look . From out of the mists of a girlish memory it seemed to rise and confront her . She tried to place it , but could not . Hour after hour Madeleine sought to solve the enigma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not know it . Just as she grasped the key , it eluded her . Just as she recognized the man , his individuality faded away . On the eighth morning , while it was yet early , she awoke with a shriek . The face confronted her ! Stripped of its ragged beard , the dreaded features had taken 011 a youthful and accusing look . " Oh , my God ! " she cried out . " It is lie ! " Her sister Isabel rushed into the room Madeleine was sitting straight up in bed , clasping her head . " Isabel , do you know who that man was , who " ? She stopped as if she had been stricken with ice water . Isabel 's heart was beating violently . Her body was perfectly quiet . But her eyes had the expression of one from whom a sacred trust is slipping . " You do know ! " cried Madeleine breathlessly . " It was Willard Winch ! " " Yes , " answered Isabel , speaking distinctly , like a metronome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago Madeleine Morley had a lover . She had seen him for the first time upon the parade ground . Willard Winch was then the colonel of his Latin School regiment . He was tall , military , handsome , fascinating . Without an introduction , and without knowing who he was , Madeleine became entranced by him . She had been of the dreamy , sentimental sort that keeps a notebook , the distorted mirror of one 's own feelings , one of the girls who write love poetry at midnight , and hide it away in a locked escritoire . Her infatuation became a misery . In self-defense Isabel had to compass an introduction to this young man , and afford Madeleine the opportunity of her dreams . As might have been expected , the result was volcanic . The lava of their natures met and fused ; and in a month 's time the young people were engaged . While these two were alike in the artless and unreserved expression of their passion , first love had a very different effect upon each of them . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard , the engagement was an iridescent dream . Willard would have felt the same if he had been engaged to any other girl ; but for Madeleine no other ' nun existed . While she gave him the exclusive worship of a consecrated nature , he accepted her with the sensuous joy that an irresponsible character may feel . More women than we suspect have the temperament of nuns . Some devote themselves to God ; others to man ; in either case it is worship . Upon her knees , Madeleine burned incense before this creature of her imagination . And , with : out his realizing it , her supreme devotion began to have a transforming effect upon Willard Winch . He now dreamed better things without doing them . He might have ended by being noble without the dissipating effect of reverie , had not something occurred which changed the whole current of his life . At that time he considered it a minor incident . But later , lie saw that it was the parting of the ways . As I said , Madeleine Morley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her handsome lover as a god . The divinity could do no wrong , and was to be treated accordingly . But one day Willard lied to her . It was an unintelligent , a foolish lie , and easily detected . But that lie disrupted the girl 's trust . Before it was uttered , there-was hardly a thing in the universe in which she did not have faith , ? so simple and unsophisticated , so ignorant and single-minded was she . After that false word was uttered , her nature was as changed as a glass of clear water in which you drop an ounce of ink . Her faith in people was gone ; her belief in God and humanity was shattered . And most of all she distrusted Willard Winch . " You lied to me ! " she blazed , white wills indignation . " I trusted you , and you deceived me . There was no need of it . I never can believe in you again , no , do n't touch me . I wish you to go . " She swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of apology , out of his mouth . The young man had not conunanded his battalions in vain , nor had he earned his popularity without acquiring some dignity . " Very well , then , " lie said , standing to his superb height , and looking to her , in spite of herself , handsomer than he had ever seemed before , " if I go now , I will never come back again , and you have ruined my life . " They were both children , ? she full of ignorance , and he of outraged pride , ? and the girl let him go . From that hour until the fatal morning a week ago she had not seen his face . But she had heard of him occasionally , and knew that he was a ruined man . With all his mad recklessness in college , he had kept much of his popularity . But he had gone down hill fast , becoming a sort of gentleman confidence man ; and later , stories were told of crimes that had been laid at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had sent him to the devil . She had no doubt of it whatever . During all these years she had never ceased wishing that he would come back to her . In spite of her conventual existence , she had seen enough of the world to know that the way in which she had dismissed her lover was a far graver fault than the petty lie that he had told . When she might have saved , she had lost him , ? to himself , as well as to her . When she might have been his angel , she had been his curse . Ah , she would have gone down on her knees to that man , no matter how degraded , how debased , he might be , and asked his pardon for her youthful folly ! Now often had she dreamed of his coining back to her , of her penitence , of his forgiveness , ? of her favor , ? but not like this . Isabel Morley sat down upon the bed , took her sister 's hand , and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle that was at hand . She had always controlled the woman whose soul lay bare before her . Could she do so now Her eyes were brimming with compassion , but they ( lid not falter before her sister 's fierce look . " You knew it all the time ! " cried the younger , " and you let me lie here like this ! How could you ? " She tried to wrench her hand away , but failed . " I read it , " Isabel spoke with great precision , " in the Transcript . Willard Winch is in the Charles Street Jail . There were three men in the barroom on the next corner from our house ; you know the place . One of them is dead . Another escaped . Willard Winch Was caught , and they accuse him of the murder . I would have given my life to keep this away from your . I did n't know who it was at the time , but after I read the paper I knew that it must have been he . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She dashed the clothes aside . " I am going to dress , " she said , passing her hand through her hair in a wild way . " There is not a minute to lose . " " Madeleine ! Madeleine ! What are you going to do ? " Madeleine looked at her sister imperiously . " I am going to him , " she said , " and there is no one who can stop me . " Isabel did not accept the challenge . She knew that the life and the conduct of her younger sister had now passed beyond her restraint . " And what are you going to do when you get there ? " sire asked , in the Brahmin manner . " I am going to save him , and if lie will have me , I will marry him . " " You roe of age , and you are in &; pendent , " replied Isabel coldly . " I suppose there is nothing to be said . " This crisis that had come to Madeleine Morley at thirty-five acted like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt languid , anmmic , incapable of actions . She was alert , she was alive . the blood seemed to storm through her veins . She felt young and resourceful . At last she had a mission in life . Fate had given her something to do , and to do at once . As she dressed , she planned . When the last hair was in place , and the last eye was hooked , she rushed to the telephone . She called up her lawyer , and with an energy that startled the placid old man , bade him meet her at the Charles Street Jail immediately . Then she put on her hat , and cast one last look at herself in the glass . There she saw a new creature . She had hitherto considered herself an impossible old maid , unattracted and unattractive . But now there greeted her two eager , flushed cheeks , two brilliant , excited blue eyes . Why , there stood before her the young girl that sire thought she had left behind her fifteen years ago ! And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within her . But the love of her life won , and . without bidding her sister good-by , she went out of the house , and walked to the Charles Street Jail . Artists for centuries have tried to depict the descent of an angel into hell . But no canvas can portray the emotions of a pure and sensitive soul on entering the Inferno . The prison is the depository of crime . Its locks , its bolts , its sentinels. are the evidences of spiritual defalcation . Its very odor has the unmistakable criminal taint . No disinfectant can eliminate the acrid presence of the soul defective . Drop the petal of the rose into the fumes of certain acids , and it shrivels on the instant . Twenty-four hours ago Madeleine Morley would have shriveled at the very thought of prison contact . But nose . with her heart beating high , she marched up to the door like a grenadier . It happened that the Sheriff of Suffolk County was in the office . This important official had a kindly nature , and listened to Madeleine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was an aristocrat ; and , besides , petty prison regulations are not made for those who are incarcerated on the charge of murder . " I will have him brought down to the guardroom , " said the Sheriff . So Madeleine Morley was ushered through two bolted doors , into the rectangular guardroom . Shc held her head high and haughtily . The prison odor smote her , and she did not choke . She had steeled her heart against any horror , and felt strong to bear anything . Before her three corridors radiated , with cells tier on tier above one another . When she heard the doors clang behind her , and found herself locked in , shut out from her own pure world , she experienced a momentary faintness . But her thoughts were fixed on the man whom her childish folly had brought to this place , and she became resolved . The Sheriff Went himself . When the turnkey unlocked the cell , the Sheriff stepped inside , and found Winch lying on his cot , asleep . " ' There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the prisoner brusquely. lie did not explain that it was a woman . The accused followed the Sheriff along the narrow , railed corridor , and descended the short , iron steps slowly , wondering who could possibly seek him in his degradation . Madeleine was sitting in the centre of the guardroom on a bench ; her back was toward this tragic processional . As the steps approached her , the color left her cheeks like chalk . Then she arose . The prisoner and the woman confronted rash other . The Sheriff cast an experienced look upon the two , motioned to the turnkey to unlock the gate that led to his office , and disappeared . Then the guardroom official turned , and , watching the pair warily , stood at the entrance to liberty . Madeleine looked up into her old lover 's face ; she , who had not yet shrunk from the prisms taint , did not shrink from the moral degradation that makes prisons a necessity . The man stood still , overcome with mortification and flushed with amazement . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . But she gazed into his degenerate eyes long and steadily . They winced and shifted , and then evaded hers . What a travesty was his face upon the noble countenance which she had once adored ! He who had once been a military example had become a slouch . Any officer of the law would have instantly picked him out as a moral wreck , but only she could discern that he was a fallen angel ; at least , she thought so . Amid the ravages of crime and dissipation she could see traces of his old beauty , that fatal inheritance which had first fascinated her young heart . Ills hair was thin and ragged ; his cheeks drawn and flabby ; his chin had become weak and vacillating ; his teeth Were stained , and his hands were soiled . Those fifteen years , spent by her is penitence and regret , had succeeded in wiping the gentleman off his figure as you wipe a sentence from a slate . You could see at a glance that Willard Winch was hopeless . But Madeleine Morley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature brought out , did not see . His degradation and his need opened the floodgates of her tenderness as no other condition could have done . " Willard , " she said very quietly , after she had gauged him with the intuition of a pure and remorseful woman , " wo n't you sit down ? " She dropped upon the hard bench and drew her gray skirt a little to one side . She was so exquisite , so beautiful , so foreign to this sin-soaked granite pile , that it seemed to the criminal a miracle that she was there . " Madeleine " ? he stammered , " 1 ? ' ? ? " Do n't say anything until I ask you , Willard , " she began very gently . " I have just heard this morning of your trouble , and I have come to help you . Nothing can shock me now . Tell me truly , are you guilty of this " ? she stopped , " or not ? " " Before God ! " blazed Willard Winch , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . " I have been bad enough , God knows , but I am innocent of this . The man was stabbed in the neck and fell into my arms . I knew what my record was , and I ran . That is all . " For a woman who had never before descended into the nether world , Madeleine Morley had remarkable composure . She bowed her head gravely in assent , and the man , perceiving that she had not lost her old instinct to trust rather than to doubt , drew a long breath of relief . " I have sent for my lawyer , " said Madeleine in a low voice , not looking up , " and he will be here right away . He is one of the most eminent members of the Boston bar , and I shall put your case into his hands . We will do everything we can to get you free , Willard . " The stupefied man looked at her . To his sodden eyes and bleared memory she had not changed . She was the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been his ! What a wreck lie had made of his life , ? for a misunderstanding , or a peccadillo ! It was the excuse that he had always held to . " You ought not to do this , " he said . His old manhood tried to assert itself ; it had been unexercised for so long that the effort was pathetic in the extreme . " I am not worth it , " he continued , with a sad smile that somehow illuminated his wasted features ; " I am considered hopeless , you know . " With a dainty , womanly gesture , she laid her gray glove upon his arm ; she had not touched his hand . " Do not ? do not say so , Willard ! After you get out of this , you will begin all over again , wo n't you ? For my sake , will you not ? " Then her eyes met his , and the abandoned man read in them for the first time the full extent of the sacrifice that she had prepared herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . I belong to another world now . It is no place for you . I want you to go , ? at once . " As he spoke , he arose . But Madeleine remained seated . " No , Willard , " she said very softly , " shall stay here . It is not hard for me to say it now , but you have been on my heart for all these years ; this has been my first chance to help you , ? to do anything in the world , ? and no one shall take it away from me . My folly when we parted ? my fault ? was greater than yours . I have forgiven you a thousand times , but I have never forgiven myself . " The man stared down upon her ; he Was speechless at this abnegation . Before his confused mind could frame adequate words , the prison door opened with a reverberation , and Madeleine arose to meet her lawyer . " Mr. Saltenway , " she began , " the man I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were once engaged . I dismissed him fifteen years ago , and lie ? he went wrong afterwards . He is here accused of murder . He tells me he is innocent , and I believe him . I want you to save him . Come , and I will introduce you . " The old family lawyer , who had known something and suspected more of Madeleine 's history , betrayed no surprise . As if he were in a drawing-room , he accompanied his client to the bench where Willard Winch stood , and accepted the introduction in a natural way . " Now , " said Madeleine , " I will leave you two together . And , Willard , " ? she looked up at the tall man who had straightened himself instinctively at the gentleman 's approach , ? " I am going to send you some things to make you comfortable ; I want you to accept them without a word ; as soon as the Sheriff will let me , I will call again . " The processes of the law laugh at im- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new kind of fight pro-reds deliberately . Mr. Saltenway had never had a murder case before ; indeed , this was his first visit to the Charles Street Jail . But he threw himself and all the resources of his profession into this unsavory cause ; and discussed it with guarded cheerfulness when Madeleine Morley arrived at his office , promptly , every morning . In a curious way , the positions which the two sisters bad held toward each other for so many years seemed now to be changed . Madeleine took the initiative ; Isabel followed . Madeleine was in good spirits ; Isabel was despondent . Madeleine went out ; Isabel remained at home . There was not a nerve in Madeleine 's whole body that was not vibrant . She looked young and happy . God had put into her keeping a lost soul to save , and the responsibility had given her angelic utility . Nothing was allowed to withstand her imperious impatience . It soon became evident that the man who had been present at this brawl , and whom Willard Winch accused of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Madeleine poured forth money like water upon detectives and agents . In many states , to be held by the Grand Jury for murder is almost equivalent to a conviction . While the law presupposes every man innocent until he is proved guilty , the contrary is the general practice . This is especially true when a man has had many taints upon his career , and has accumulated what is technically called a " record . " Miss Madeleine Morley called on Willard Winch twice a week ; she also supplied him with some few necessities , and with the many luxuries which a good-natured officer allows to those incarcerated for capital crime . The oftener she came to the prison , the greater her pity grew , and the more convinced she became that Willard was her mission in life . Every Boston woman must have a mission , ? God , or possibly Buddha , supplying the material . Often a whole life is spent in hunting for it . Strained expressions on tired faces go searching for it through the Back Bay . Among the numberless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeleine 's was the most reasonable , for it was Man . No argument could be brought to dissuade her from the new vocation which was giving her the first happiness that she had known in many years . If she had gone into the Associated Charities , she would have obtained a better perspective . As it was , she lacked focus , and had heart . She was thoroughly satisfied with the exchange . As the weeks dragged on , she became acquainted with her old lover . This was true in a very searching sense . Most intimate friends are not acquainted ; few husbands and wives understand earls other . But Willard Winch told everything . He concealed nothing of his degradation . He had gambled , he had stolen , he had committed almost every crime in the catalogue . He related their history with a certain gusto that did not smack of shame . The innocent woman , alternately repelled and fascinated , sat listening to these tales of outlawry . Winch had something of the man left in him yet ; and tried his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exalted state of penitence , was throwing herself at his feet . But he could not fathom the heart of the woman . She who would condone any crime , who would well-nigh glorify any misdemeanor , that the man whom she loved had committed in the past , would not forgive an infidelity . Once , at the end of one of his long , rambling , easily mouthed confessions , his eyes , that had hardly ever sought hers , turned upon her with a fierce intentness which she had not witnessed before . " Madeleine , " he said , " I want you to believe this , if you do n't anything else that I 've told you . I have been all kinds of a blackleg . There is no sin and deviltry that I have not dipped into . There is only one thing I have not done . I suppose it was only because I could not . I have never loved any other WOIllall but you . I have never kissed any other woman , or made love to any other woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thank God for it . It 's the only thing I 've got left to me . " He stopped for a moment , running his hungry eyes over every sweet feature of her face . Then he controlled himself , gave a slight laugh and a shrug . " I shall not speak of it again , Madeleine , and I want you to forget it . No woman has done more for man than you are doing for roe . Do you think I will pay you back in ? that ? " Willard Winch stood up , made with something of his old courtly grace a formal bow , motioned to the corridor officer , who watched him carefully , and without another word walked back to his cell . From that hour Madeleine Morley would have given him her soul to trample upon . Psychology has for ages been trying to interpret crime . It is the result of heredity . It is the conclusion of environment . It is the disintegration of the cells in the nerve tissue . It is disease . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ebb of our moral tide . But all agree that crime is contagious . That is one of the reasons why the criminal is shut in . Innocence has not been deemed worthy of volumes and research . And yet , it is predicated by a like environment and heredity . It is the moral ozone that vivifies all adjacent decaying life ; and is as great as , if not a greater mystery than , crime itself . The abnormal can generally be more easily explained than the normal . It is probably more natural for the tree to grow crooked than to grow straight . Purity is the burning-glass that consumes foulness . Or , say that some pure natures stand impregnable , like a mountain of corundum . At this , sin may peck a thousand years in vain . Other white souls are more like a hill of grass-grown gravel : they may be tunneled from wit le out . Before these , soinehow or other , sin does not shrink . The had person has an intuition for the possibilities of evil that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mutual gravitation of the weak . Madeleine Morley was of the adamantine kind . Upon her , sin might splash , and leave her as white and as transparent as before . Her innocence was of the invigorating variety . One could not help being better for knowing her , and nobler for being her daily companion . To a great extent this bad been so while she had lived a negative existence . But now that she had become positive , this was peculiar in a marked degree . Upon Willard Winch she had been acting as an X-ray upon a cancerous growth . This she did not realize . The ray does not know that it heals , but the patient knows it . In no sense of the word could her relation with the prisoner be called a duel between innocence and sin . Before her beautiful personality , her exquisite delicacy , and her elemental virtue , the evil in Willard Winds seemed to shrivel . And in so exalted a state was she that the knowledge of what Ise had been did her no harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason that her mind was only receptive of good . His repeated confessions , and at times unnecessarily noxious details , only left her more full of pity than before . It is to be doubted whether she realized at all the nature of the many crimes that he seemed eager to admit . But Madeleine was not a saint . She was a loving , dependent woman , and her absolute belief in his fidelity to her through crime and temptation outweighed in her sweet heart any sin that he had committed . It happened , three weeks after Mr. Saltenway had been thrown into this case , that a minor arrest was made upon the street of a suburb . The man was held as an old offender , pending an investigation of his record by the court and by the probation officer . Ever alert for the H slightest clue , Mr. Saltenway looked this man up . and arranged for him to be confronted with Winch before sentence to the Island could be passed . Willard recognized the man immediately . The graver charge took precedence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Charles Street Jail . In one of those moments in which guilt believes itself to be trapped by indubitable evidence , I he man confessed that he had killed his companion in hot-headed self-defense . This confession was all that was needed to relieve Willard Winch from the charge of murder , and to release him from jail , on sufficient surety for his appearance as witness for the government . Madeleine Morley had the Christmas nature . She loved beautiful surprises . She never gave a present but that she planned the greater and the most unexpected pleasure . In this she was like a child . Eternal youth is the rarest gift that God grants to us . It is the most misunderstood , the most lovable , and the most joy-giving . When Madeleine heard from her lawyer that the man for whom she had been so feverishly searching had not only been found and identified , but had confessed , she clapped her hands like a girl . When you have arranged with the District Attorney and the Judge for Willard 's release , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one to bring him the good news . I want him to walk out of prison a free man with me . " The white - haired , hard - headed old lawyer turned his face modestly away at the sight of his client 's artless enthusiasm . Professionally he had admired her work in the prisoner 's behalf , but personally be had never approved of her motive for doing it . It took only a day for the necessary papers to be made out for the attorney 's surety and the release of Willard Winch ; this was done , and these were duly forwarded by messenger to the old mansion in Charles Street . Madeleine was sitting with her sister , humming a happy air . VOL. 95 ? NO 3 . To this Isabel was listening with an ' Apprehensive frown . The maid knocked softly , and laid a legal envelope in Madeleine 's hand . " Shall I go ? " asked Isabel , in a well-bred , sarcastic tone ; she had noticed her sister 's vivid blush . But - Madeleine tore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sheriff of Suffolk County . Then she looked up at her sister with brave appeal . Isabel softened , and stretched out her hand in her old maternal way . Then Madeleine flung herself at her elder 's feet as if she had been a child at confession , and kissed her sister 's hand with a beautiful submission . " Isabel , dear , " she said , " Willard Winch has suffered much . lie is innocent , and I shall carry him this message of liberty myself . I have planned for him to come to this house , ? if you do n't mind ? lIe has nowhere else to go to . You know very well that I have always loved this loan . I owe him a great reparation ; and when he is free , I shall ask him to marry me . You wo n't make it hard for me , ? will you , dear ? " Isabel Morley looked down upon the child whom she had cherished , the sister whom she had shielded , ? and , like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the being whom she loved supremely . What she had sowed she could not reap . And the peace that she had prayed and planned for was not to be leers . Not knowing it , she had nurtured a stronger nature than her own , and this now arose before her and commanded her . " Madeleine , " she said , " you have chosen madly , but I pray God to grant you the miracle of happiness . I ? I shall stand by you ; I always have . " Very solemnly the two sisters kissed each other ; and then Madeleine went met to her old lover . " I think lee expects something , Miss Morley , " said the Sheriff , conducting her within the guardroom , with much ceremony , " but I have not told him . We seldom do unless it is sure . I will bring him down myself . " Charles Street Jail had wrought a surprising effect upon the prisoner of suspicion . Regular hours , coarse and healthful prison food , long meditation , and especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined to clear the prisoner 's eyes and complexion , and to restore some of the natural splendor of his appearance . Care and decent living would certainly make him an unusually handsome /natl . His repeated interviews with Madeleine had produced a sort of hypnotic consequence upon him . Sire had willed him to be good , and had prayed her soul out to this effect , and he had ahnost come to think that he was . Willard had spent hours in regretting the folly , and especially the insecurity , of his choice in life . The old romantic feeling that he had for Madeleine as a girl returned to him strongly . He had told the truth when he said that he had been terse to her ; for his career , curiously enough , had never included women . They had disgusted ! din with too many advances . For the overbold he could never care . Madeleine had always been to him a restraining dream in that respect . And now the reality was even more intoxicating . She surrounded him with a prismatic halo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one else would claim him as friend or even as acquaintance . At times he was persuaded that nobility of purpose had been born within him , that he had turned his back upon his old life forever . These thoughts were especially active after she had left trim . He then threw himself upon the cot , when the iron door had clanged , and dreamed of a respectable and unexciting future . These visions , it must be said to his credit , did not involve the woman who had sacrificed herself to him . For he felt then that he should be strong enough to do great things alone . Most lawless men do not like to acknowledge , even to themselves , their dependence upon a woman . As Willard Winch approached with something of his old military step , Mad , leine 's heart beat rapidly . But for her years , she was still a girl . " Oh , Willard ! " she cried , " I am so ! nippy I ca n't wait another instant ! Here it is ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was , he passed it on to the Sheriff , who looked at them both with a quizzical smile . " I suppose I can go now , " said Winch casually ; his new independence of manner , Madeleine thought , became him well " Yes , Mr. Winch , " the Sheriff answered courteously , " I am compelled to refuse to keep you any longer as my guest , although I regret to have you go . " " The regrets are entirely on your side , " Winds answered , with a smile that would have been well bred , had not the lips that framed it been ruined by dissipation . But Madeleine was no student of physiognomy . She had chosen to look at this man through her own haze , and she would do it to the end of her life . " How soon can you be ready to go ? " she asked , with girlish impatience . " 1 want you to go out with me . " The released prisoner looked at his savior good-naturedly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? hey , Sheriff ? I ca n't go too soon to please me . If you will excuse me , Madeleine , I will be right back . " It seemed an hour to the woman , but in reality it was a very short time , when the man returned . He was neatly and almost luxuriously dressed in the clothes that sire had ordered sent him from a fashionable tailor . They did not speak . With a light jest he shook hands with the Sheriff , and passed through the iron portals , out of the granite prison , and into the air , a free man . The sun was shining joyously , and the July air was hot with life . Children were playing opposite in the little park , and beyond was the Charles River Basin , and some shipping .

At the next corner Willard Winch stoppedand looked back . Madeleine had not stirred . With a half sigh that was almost a half sneer , he turned again , and strode faster on . People swept between . At the corner of Beacon Street Ire drew a breath of relief . " Another incident closed , " he thought . But Madeleine stood there , a breaking pillar of woe , until her sister Isabel ran down the steps , flung warm arms about her , and drew her back into their old life .
