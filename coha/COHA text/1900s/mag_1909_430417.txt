MALACHI , archbishop of Armagh , Ireland , was a very dear friend of Bernard , the great abbot of Clairvaux . It seemed to Malachi that Clairvaux , with its quiet , its orderly life and enthusiasm for righteousness , was the nearest to heaven of any spot on earth , and it was a great joy to him to pass the closing days of his life there . After his death Bernard wrote lovingly , if not critically , of the life of his friend , and charmingly naive are the stories he tells of Malachi 's life in wild and distant Ireland . There are numerous instances of wonderful healing . Bernard had never investigated them , but he doubtless wrote them down as they had been told to him by Malachi himself , or some of his friends . There is reason for supposing that some of them are substantially true and that Bernard believed them all to be so . One story is about a woman , worn out by a long-continued illness , and apparently at the point of death . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay , and so he contrived a plan which showed his keen Irish wit and his knowledge of the influence of the mind on the body . He blessed three apples , and said to his servant : " Take these apples , over which I have invoked the name of God , carry them to the sick woman as quickly as you can and tell her that if she tastes of these apples she will not taste of death till she has seen Malachi . " The patient was greatly exhilarated when she heard that Malachi would grant her request . She was too weak to speak a word , but showed by signs that she wished to be lifted up a little . This was done and she tasted of the apples . By the act of tasting she was strengthened and gave thanks . Then the Lord gave her sleep and she rested quietly in him . Malachi came the next day and the sight of him hastened her recovery . There is another curious ease recorded , in whichMalachi 's power is made evident in his absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the north of Ireland was possessed with evil spirits . He knew that there were two of them , because he heard them talking . One night he heard one of them say to the other : " Look out that this fellow does not touch the straw on which that hypocrite slept , or he will escape us . " The sick man knew that they were speaking of Malachi who had slept there a few nights before , and so , weak in body but strong in faith , he began to crawl toward the straw , and the air was filled with clamor and cryings , " Stop him , stop him , we are losing our victim . " The more they cried , the faster the sufferer hurried on his hands and knees , and when he reached the straw and rolled over onto it , he heard the demons cry , " We have lost him . " At once he lost his fear of demons and all his sickness passed away . This is a typical case in many ways . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man . Perhaps he was only afraid of the dark .  |p500  His troubles might have been a bad dream or delirium tremens or anything in between . The convenient diagnosis in this case , as in hundreds of others , was that he was possessed by evil spirits . He believed that a certain remedy would cure him , and therefore it did . This man had two devils . Malachi cured one case in which one devil had possession of two women alternately . A woman who was possessed came to him for healing . Malachi prayed and the spirit went out of her taut passed into another woman standing near . Malachi drove it out of her and then the evil spirit went back into the first victim , and as fast as he drove it from one it would enter into the other , but he finally succeeded in expelling the spirit from both . Today we recognize this as hysteria , temporarily controlled by the influence of Malachi . This Irish saint seemed to have great success in making the dumb speak . A mute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed over her and sent her away talking . The wife of a certain man could not speak . He brought her to Malachi and begged for his pity . Malachi evoked the divine blessing over her and commanded her to repeat the Lord 's prayer , which she did . Another case was that of a man who had been deprived of the use of his tongue twelve days . Malachi visited him , commanded him to speak , and he recovered his speech . Crazy men and women , bound with chains , were brought to the saint and he made them whole . There was one cure which seemed to Bernard very wonderful , even greater than raising the dead to life . It was the case of a woman who was so dominated by a spirit of rage and fury that her neighbors and relatives kept away from her , and even her sons endured her with great difficulty . She was bold , quick-tempered , with a tongue and hand to be feared . There was trouble wherever she went . Her sons were sorry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her will , into the presence of Malachi . He was sorry for her and pitied her sons because of the trouble they had . He called her aside for a private , searching conversation , and found that she had never confessed her sins . She confessed at his command and he prayed for her that the Almighty would give her a spirit of meekness , ordering her in the name of Christ to be a better woman . There was a great change after that in her life , So great was her gentleness that it was evident to all that the change was produced by the hand of the omnipotent God . This change which seemed so wonderful was only the miracle of the converted life , no greater miracle than occurs daily when men confess their sins , leave their old lives , arise and go unto their Father . Many other miracles of the Irish saint are recorded , most of which can be explained on natural grounds . The people believed that he could cure them , and he did . Eligius and Malachi may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For our final illustration we take Bernard of Clairvaux , who in many ways is in a class by himself . It is probable that he was the most influential man of his century . He was considered a saint and a miracle worker , and the remarkable thing in his case is that the wonderful cures attributed to him seem to be well authenticated . In 1146 and 1147 he aroused men by his preaching to enter upon the second crusade . As he went from one city to another his lofty and persuasive eloquence produced the greatest enthusiasm , and if we are to believe the reports several hundred miracles were performed in the course of the six months . It is characteristic of the cures wrought by the saints generally that they are legendary in character ; a few are reported by contemporaries , but Bernard 's cures while he was preaching the second crusade are reported by ten or more eyewitnesses who prepared a daily written report of what they had seen . They were men of character and ability , occupying responsible positions in the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did so day after day . They tried to report honestly what they saw . Their statements are very circumstantial ; dates and places are given . Their testimony is often introduced by the words , " I saw . " No one can read . the account without being impressed with the fact that these most respectable men were telling what they believed to be the truth . In the number of the cured were the blind , lame , deaf , mute , withered , contracted , paralyzed , maimed , palsied and insane . There were about one hundred and twenty-five blind who had their sight restored ; nearly as many lame who were cured . About fifty deaf had hearing restored , and smaller numbers of the others . There are striking peculiarities in this list . The familiar cases of demoniacal possession are entirely wanting , and there are no fever cases . Bernard 's method of heal/ ing was extremely simple . He made the sign of the cross or placed his hand upon the sufferer , touching the afflicted spot . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty of the testimony . A boy blind from birth had never been able to lift his eyelids . Those who had seen great miracles did not believe that Bernard could cure him . Bernard placed his hand on the boy , made a brief prayer and with his fingers raised the drooping lids , and asked the boy whether he could see . The boy replied , " I see , master . I see you and all men , bearded . " Then , joyfully clapping his hands , he cried out , " My God ! My God ! I shall not stub my toes on the stones any more ! " Another remarkable case of healing was that of a boy blind from birth , whose eyes were covered with a substance like the white of an egg , so that they did not seem to be like eyes . This boy received sight when Bernard placed his hand upon him . " This we proved in many ways , hardly believing that sight was possible in such eyes . " Bernard attempted to heal one woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later suddenly her sight came to her . There is a curious circumstance connected with the healing of a deaf mute . A boy , mute from birth , managed in the crowd to kiss the hand of the saint and passed on . A soldier standing by asked him , " Oz tu ? " ? " Do you hear ? " ? and the boy , never having heard a voice before , replied in the words he had heard , " Oz tu . " Another case is reported which is very much like this . In addition to these which we must accept as unexplainable on natural grounds , or at least by anything that we yet understand , there were a large number which might be explained by laws which we partly understand today , like the healing of the paralytics or those who are classed as " contracted . " Sometimes it was a case of wry or twisted neck , and the bystanders could hear the bones snap back into place as Bernard touched the sufferer . Of the more than a hundred lame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know whether a particular ease was rheumatism or what it was , but we have no reason for supposing that the cure did not take place , because such cures are common now at the shrines of the saints . Morison , in his life of Bernard , calls attention to the unusual number and character of the witnesses and dismisses the subject by saying , " They thought they saw even as they told us ; they really saw what their fervid , uncritical minds suggested to them . " He believed , in a word , that these men were self-hypnotized . Storrs 's view is cautiously expressed in these words : " When it is asserted by contemporaries that fevers were cured , or ulcers removed by his presence , his word , his touch , when it is affirmed by Godfrey , his secretary , afterward himself abbot of Clairvaux , that he had personally seen the deaf made to hear , the blind to see , the paralyzed to walk , I do not know what better to do than to accept the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with a governing Christian temper , actuated by the spirit of love , they may perhaps be properly regarded as solitary workings of that higher power of life which Christ introduced into human nature . ' " In this connection it is interesting to notice what Bernard himself thought about his wonder-working power , doubly interesting because it is one of the very few cases in which any miracle worker makes any allusion to the possession of such ability . " I greatly marvel what these miracles may mean , or why it should be seen that God works them by such an one as I am ! For I do not seem to have read on the sacred pages of any signs surpassing these in kind . Of course wonders have been accomplished by holy and perfect men , and also by deceivers . I am conscious neither of holiness nor of deceit . I know that it is not mine to equal the merits of the saints , which have been illustrated by miracles . I trust I do not belong to the class of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrecognized by him . " He finally concluded that " signs of this kind do not contemplate the holiness of the one , but the salvation of the many ; that God does not look so much at moral perfection in the man by whom he works them , as at the opinion entertained about him , that he may so commend to men the holiness believed to belong to his instrument . The things are not done for the benefit of those by whom they are done , but for the greater number who see them or know them . God does not work such things to the end that he may prove them holier than others , but that others may become more eager lovers and seekers of his holiness . The signs imply nothing personal to myself ; since I know them to be occasioned by the reputation which has come to me rather than by my life ; they are not to give commendation to me , but admonitions to others . "  |p502  In the Rhine journey of Bernard of Clairvaux the conditions for faith healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , in which people were just as ready to accept the unexplained as they were that which was simple . They had unbounded confidence in the ability of Bernard to perform cures . They were anxious that they themselves and their friends should gain the benefits which they were sure he could bestow upon them . It was a journey marked by the most intense religious enthusiasm , in which they believed that Bernard 's mission as preacher of the second crusade was divinely attested by his miracles . Not only were the conditions favorable and the people ready , but Bernard himself had the qualities necessary for this work . He believed himself commissioned to preach the second crusade and that these miracles were an attestation of the call . Very rarely has there ever lived a human being with such a power over other men , call it hypnotism , personal magnetism or what you will . When he went into the monastic life he carried his companions with hirer . He transformed the dormant Cistercian order into a great power by his own personality . He faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will and his marvelous persuasive power compelled them against their judgment to enter upon the second crusade . Revered as few men ever were , and loved with equal intensity , he was well fitted to influence and control them at his will . Now , a closing thought , which applies to Bernard and others like him . It is one which can not be developed here , but perhaps the one most important of all in our study of psychotherapy , though most difficult to understand . Bernard was a mystic . The object of his life was to be one with Christ as the branch is one with the vine , that the divine power might flow through him to men . To a remarkable degree he and the other saints were conscious of the divine presence and sensitive to the divine power . We need to be wiser than we are now to say definitely how much this had to do with the cures which were effected by them . They believed profoundly in prayer , that God was in his world , near to everyone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divine aid was the essential thing in healing , and that man 's part was to come into such relationship to the divine that God could use him .  |p503
