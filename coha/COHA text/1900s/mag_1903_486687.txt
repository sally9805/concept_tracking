The bitter cry of Wall Street for some months past has been that " confidence " etirns being undermined by some wicked man , , or men . Many Nathan-like voices have reproachfully said to President Roosevelt , " Thou art the man ! " The moment , it has been asserted , that the Government brought the Northern Securities suit , capital took fright , the erstwhile simple-hearted and confiding investor received a " chill , " the crops took to doing badly , and the great captains of industry  --  such as the builders of yachts and automobiles for stock brokers and promoters  --  began to set their houses in order . It was a beautiful theory  --  so clear , so closely knit in logic , so comforting after its melancholy fashion . We fear , however , that a ' rival ex -- planation is likely td come into vogue . after last week 's revelation in the United States Shipbuilding suit , by means of which the screen was thrown down acid the public was permitted to see promoting " as she is really promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardy growth not to be shaken by the scandalous spectacle . The testimony of Mr. Dresser disclosed a shocking state of affairs .

To be both purchaser and seller , to have a pool within a pool , and an agreement behind an agreement , and , at the same moment that a lying prospectus was issued to the public , to fleece the investor even before he invested  --  that is the kind of thing in which supposedly honest men were engaged . What the law will say about their transactions we must wait to see . It is certain that under such a Company 's Act as England has , the whole proceeding would have been set aside by the courts , and the promoters compelled to disgorge their , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , every intelligent man is competent to pronounce judgment His verdict will be that the methods practised were no more reputable than those of the common sharper . Nearly every element of indecent cheating appears to have been present , while the attempt to hoodwink and bleed the public could not have been more unblushing But what we ask is , How is all this going to affect the small investor the country over ? Is his confidence to be restored by the publication of such schemes to rob him ? Is he likely to come trooping back to Wall Street and help lift a sagging market . when he sees snares laid to catch his feet ? As destroyers of confidence , it appears to us certain that those who have most lamented its destruction outstrip all possible rivals . Mr. Dresser 's startling evidence has an instructive bearing on the vexed question of " Wall Street morality . " We have had paraded before us the " vast transactions depending entirely upon good faith " ; the scrupulous fulfilment of contracts ; the word as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful and admirable , no doubt , but it touches only the superficies of real morals . What lies beneath ? Shall a man boast of living up to an agreement when , behind it , there is a secret and dishonorable understanding ? The morality which is really required in Wall Street , and which the late revelations make to appear so , lamentably wanting in at least certain financial circles , is of the kind which insists upon good faith and open and fair dealing through and through . It is not enough to meet your obligations at the bank , or to deliver stock as agreed ; you must beware of underhanded plots and of striking hands in the dark to make a swollen and greedy personal profit out of the company in which you are urging the thrifty to put their small savings ; you must give the humblest outside investor the same rights as yourself , the knowing insider , or else all your trumpeted morality is as a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal There will be many to say that confidence ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting as we have now seen laid bare Justified confidence in the country 's stable prosperity is one thing ; the other is not confidence , but a confidence game We suspect that people in general will view with a good deal of cheerful resignation the slow sinking to the ground of the grossly inflated financial balloons . Upon really sound business the effect can not be harmful . Nor can its moral influence be anything /Mt wholesome Men will say , with a good deal of justified complacency " Well , it is a good thing to have this bubble burst Wild dreams of making millions overnight will no longer demoralize our young men . The day of the steady worker in regular business will come again ; and the professional man on a ? small in , come will not be so much tempted to envy the prosperity of the wicked . Confidence in legitimate enterprise and in honesty and high-mindedness is , after all , better than confidence in the conjurers and the conspirators of boomed and bursted combinations . " That some of the men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-eared public that ever chased a financial rainbow , will be believed by those who read the extraordinary published correspondence relating to the underwriting of the Shipbuilding Company . THE STEEL STOCK DIVIDEND . The reduction by one-half of the dividend on the United States Steel Corporation 's common stock is unquestionably one of those events which , - later years remember as landmarks in finance . Considered merely as an incident in the ups and downs of the steel and iron trades , announcement that decreased profits for a quarter necessitate smaller payments to the shareholder is neither unusual nor startling . Any one who examines the company 's reported earnings for the- past three months , will endorse the directors ' action as wise and conservative . More than this , it is quite safe to say that few people with experience in the field of stock investments seriously believed , when the " company was organized , that the $500,000,000 common stock could continue indefinitely to draw dividends . The judgment of investors who act upon such conclusions was expressed no less plainly in the market 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to pay more than $55 per share for this 4 per cent . security , than in the more recent fall of its price to below $13 What happened last week , then , was a foregone conclusion from the day of the billion-dollar merger , and need cause no astonishment to the investing world . But there is another reason why the reduction is of the most far-reaching importance No corporation in the world numbers so many individual investors on its books . The Steel Company 's annual report , last March , showed 58,629 shareholders , of which number 26,830 held the common stock This number had been increasing rapidly ; during the twelve preceding months , 9,107 new names had been added to holdings of the common shares , and there is reason to believe that the increase since last March has been even greater . In this army of owners of the common stock there are undoubtedly many thousands who were not experienced in the nature of the Steel Corporation 's problem , and who bought the stock becau-se they believed that 4 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that risks of this sort will always confront investors ; that , if they buy a stock in ignorance of its possible vicissitudes , they have themselves to blarag . This is quite true ; but , in the Steel Corporation 's case , the questions of real importance are , whether the company did right in beginning payment on the common stock , and whether the mere fact of such payment , at the start , did not mislead the uninformed investor . For ourselves , we have always held that payment of dividends on the common stock was a mistake , and events have amply confirmed that judgment . The company 's earnings have , to be sure , shown a substantial surplus over dividends . During the calendar year 1902 , for instance , net receipts of $108,534,000 provided for $18,227,000 interest and sinking funds , for dividends of $35,720,000 on the preferred and of $20,332,000 on the common , and still- left 134,253,000 surplus on the books . Working capital , exceeding $50 , - 000,000 , was also reported . On the face of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned , and he could not see why shareholders should not get it The answer has been made , however , in the company 's own fiscal operations . Early in 1902 , the need of $50,000,000 for use in raising certain properties to the standard confronted the company . Had it reserved for such purposes the cash paid ' out in dividends on the common stock , the outlay would have been easily arranged tor . Instead , the company resorted ' to the money market , with - unpleasant results now sufficiently well known to every one . We do not suppose that any competent observer would to-day deny that payment of dividends on the common stock , under such circumstances , was a financial mistake . Not only is it true that needs such as those of 1902 are recurrent in every manufacturing industry , but there is always before great industries the chance of sudden fall an earnings , through labor troubles or declining trade . The way to prepare for these possibilities is , not to pay out at once in dividends the margin over visibly necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost care , and begin to pay dividends when the company 's earning power , at other times than the climax of a " boom " in trade , has been fairly tried . To test the wisdom of such policy , one need only ask himself what would have been the company 's situation now , in the trade and in the markets , had it never voted dividends on the common stock , but reserved the cash thus paid to use as need arose Such a fall as has occurred in the preferred shares would scarcely have been conceivable . We are aware of the arguments commonly advanced in Wall Street circles to justify dividends on the common stock . First , it was necessary to induce the subsidiary companies to agree to amalgama tion , and in some of those companies , which were to be acquired through exchange of stock , the common shareholders were drawing dividends . Second , the placing of $500,000,000 common stock , or any substantial part of it . in the general public 's hands , might have been impossible if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both these arguments , as an appeal to the promoters ' mind . But we must also draw attention to their total unsoundness as an economic plea , and to the highly dangerous conclusions in which an argument of the sort must end . If dividends , otherwise inadvisable , may rightly be paid to induce investors to give up their money , then the practices of the Fisks and Goulds , a generation since , have a powerful defence . Indeed , the Consolidated Lake Superior concern might quite as readily plead that it had to pay last year 's 7 per ? cent . dividends , though on the verge of financial disaster , because on no other basis could the stock be " distributed . " In the Lake Superior case , the policy meant bankruptcy ; in the Steel Corporation 's case it , of course . means nothing of the kind . But the dangerous principle is asserted , in the one instance as in the other PLASTERER AND ARTIST . The general public is , we believe , aware that the managers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of the exhibition than has been the case in other world 's fairs For instance , $500,000 has been appropriated for a display of the work of American sculptors , and numerous artists have contributed , under the direction of Mr. Karl Bitter , the chief of the sculpture department . Many of these plaster statues and groups are of colossal proportions , and as they are completed they are transported to St Louis in two or more pieces , according to their size . On arrival there they are moved to the grounds in readiness for setting up in the appointed places . Naturally , this work of setting up requires very considerable skill if it is to be properly done . A number of the pieces are generally damaged while en route , and need remodelling , as do the joints where the sections meet . To place this task of rejoining and remodelling in the hands of unskilled persons is to run the risk of ruining the achievements of the sculptors . Some of the younger of them have for the first time been given an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have toiled over their contributions with the conviction that upon them to a large degree depends their immediate artistic future . In their eyes the filling up of an opening of two or three inches between the parts of their works can be properly done only by one thoroughly familiar with anatomical modelling . This common-sense opinion was shared by the director of sculpture , who designated the best sculptors of the St. Louis Modellers ' and Sculptors ' Union , No 245 , to do the work , thus recognizing the principle of union labor while seeking efficiency . But this by no. - means satisfied the rampant spirit of unionism The modellers of St Louis were , of course , content , but there was another guild to be heard from  --  the Union ( No. 3 ) of plain plasterers , who promptly demanded that the work be given to them , and coupled with their demand a threat to organize a general strike of all the Exposition workmen unless their wishes were acceded to That these statues were modelled in plaster was the very plausible reason for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their jobs on all the buildings . The negotiations were considerably protracted by reason of the fact that at the last meeting most of the labor delegates were drunk and the conference ended in a row . The Director of Public Works , Mr. Taylor , who has been in every way most friendly to the unions , when asked his opinion decided in favor of the sculptors . His decision was ignored as completely as was the Missouri State Board of Arbitration 's similar finding . This official organization went over the matter very carefully , after giving a public hearing to the representatives of both sides ; the Exposition authorities fighting the battle of the sculptors . The plasterers , taking the ground that they could remodel a broken hand , or face , or arm , as well as any " high-toned " sculptor , whether educated in St. Louis , New York , or Paris , flatly refused to abide by the decision of the State Board , precisely as the Typographical Union declined to be bound by the arbitrators in its dispute with the Spokane Spokesman-Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a union is the supreme law of the land , and no union need abide by an arbitration unless it is favored by the judges . On August 10 last , in despair , the chief of sculpture addressed an earnest appeal to the General President of the " Operative Plasterers ' International Association of the United States and Canada , " Mr. J. B Cavanaugh of Colorado Springs , Col. In- this Mr. Bitter set forth the situation with the utmost courtesy and fairness , but gave it as his opinion that for the common plasterers to assume their fitness for this work would be much the same as for him to call himself an astronomer because he was able to look through a telescope . After waiting more than a month for a reply , the following letter was received by Mr. Bitter 's superintendent in St Louis . We reprint it in full as a sample of that courtesy and politeness which employers are everywhere now beginning to expect in their dealings with unions : OPERATIVE PLASTERERS ' INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Office of Secretary-Treasurer , 2712 Park Ave Mr Carl Sup't of Sculpture , Worlds Fair Dear Sir The following decission was sent to this office by the General President of the 0 , P. I. A. That plasterers shall do all pointing , and to notify locals . Locals referred to are No 245 which is composed of modelers No. 242 composed of shop hands and No. 3 which is composed of plasterers said notice has been sent . Trusting that end controversy after October 15 there would be an increase in their wages of ten cents per hour and a minimum wage of eighty cents an hour . When a man is down , the proper thing to do is to hit him once more . If we have recited the facts in this latest labor-union victory soberly and without embroidery , it is not because we fail to realize the importance of the stand taken in St. Louis . Our readers have all heard from labor leaders what organization has done for the workingmen . It has given them shorter hours and higher wages and greater consideration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilled labor is steadily rising in the social scale . But now the credit side of the labor-union ledger has an entry which will , we are sure , make the bitterest critic hold his tongue for ever and ever . By one stroke of his pen , Mr. J. B. Cavanaugh of Colorado has emancipated a whole union , has lifted it out of the ranks of laboring men and placed it squarely alongside of our best and greatest artists . Bitter , MacMonnies , Adams , Ruckstuhl , even St. Gaudens himself , are now but brothers to the artists of the Plasterers ' Union No. 3 . More than that , the great mind in Colorado Springs has solved the question how to democratize art , which has puzzled many a less notable brain . All the visitors to St. Louis will see now the triumph of the plain plasterer in plastic art . MR . CHAMBERLAIN 'S BID . Joseph Chamberlain never - displayed his adroit and ready talent to better advantage than in his Glasgow speech on October 6 . He knows how to wear in perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracefully to sink his unimportant personality in a cause vital to his country 's well being ; is studiously moderate where he was expected to be extreme ; and applies his flexible mind to the intricacies of the difficult case he has to argue with an appearance of candor and of complete mastery very specious and fetching , and only lust short of carrying conviction . His personal courage is undoubted , rising as it dues to actual audacity . One must believe that a good part of the enthusiasm which he evoked from his Glasgow audience was but another form of the Englishman 's admiration for a statesman who does not fear his fate , but puts his political fortunes to the touch , to win or lose all To devote a single word to the political aspect of Mr. Chamberlain 's bid for-popular support , it is clear tffat he protests his self-abnegation a trifle too much . For him to affirm his absolute loyalty to Mr. Balfour , and to assert that he will never compete with the Premier for the party leadership , is magnificent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamberlain simply must be the next Prime Minister if his policy is upheld by the electors . Mr Balfour would be the first to perceive this . The King would no more think of sending for anybody but Chamberlain , if he were returned as the victorious chieftain after a great political battle , than did the Queen of turning to any man ' but Gladstone after he had beaten the Tories on Irish Disestablish-meat To-day , Mr. Chamberlain stands as the statesman who has driven a wedge deep into the Conservative party . If in the future he succeeds in uniting that party and making it triumphant on his one issue , he will be the one man to become its titular leader To hold any other view is to hug a delusion . - It is , however , the economic rather than the political side of Mr. Chamberlain 's speech that most challenges comment . We pass by his array of figures proving to a Great Britain conscious of good health that she is really in a rapid decline . These statistics and the inferences from them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stop over his alleged demonstration that the British workman stands to win two or three farthings more than he will lose by Mr. Chamberlain 's food taxes . De minims it is not for us across the Atlantic to debate . But there are certain gross fallacies into which Mr. Chamberlain has been betrayed that vitiate his whole argument . He adopts completely the magic theory Of protection . To him , it is a kind of supernatural device to make poor countries rich . Natural resources , acquired skill , a multiplying and enterprising population  --  all these go for nothing in making a nation wealthy , compared with a tariff tax on foreign imports . He adduces the expansion of German and American trade , and accounts for it wholly by the protective system . What nature has done , what political and social conditions have wrought , he entirely ignores Germany and the United States have grown opulent by a trick of taxation which England has been too stupid to imitate . Why did Mr. Chamberlain not point 16 those protected countries , France , and Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's protection has failed to produce the egg in those cases ! Sir Samuel Romilly 's old complaint that Englishmen would not take the trouble really to grasp the argument of Adam Smith , will be revived if Mr. Chamberlain 's notions are caught up . To imagine that an artificial system of taxation can create wealth is to maintain what logical analysis and practical experience both declare to be nonsense . It is the gifts of nature and the energy of man which , in the long run , determine national supremacy in manufactures and trade . If England is , as there seems good reason to believe , approaching a period of relative industrial decline , the cause for it is to be found in the increasing cost of her coal and raw materials , as compared with those of the United States . The fundamental situation was not caused , and can not be altered , by any device of protective taxes . Laws can meddle and mar , but it is nature that has her way in the end . Mr. Chamberlain 's references to American tariffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but why ? It is his own idea carried out to its legitimate but uncomfortable end . He says that some of our " best minds " think we ought to reduce our customs taxes ; but those are also the minds which hold that they never should have been imposed , that they inevitably mean economic waste , class favoritism , and political corruption , Nor is Mr. Chamberlain more fortunate in alluding to the destruction of the Welsh tin-plate industry by the McKinley tariff . One of the interesting economic developments of the past two years has been the restoration of the prosperity of that very industry  --  without any protection . Mr. Chamberlain appears not to have heard of this , though the Tribune has " explained it away . " To give his scheme even a semblance of success , Mr Chamberlain must induce the self-governing colonies to accept it But here his argument is pitiably weak , and the facts are fearfully against him . At the very moment of saying that these colonies are thorough-paced protectionists ( he does not say , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclude British goods as any others ) he supposes that the plea of kinship and Imperial greatness will move them to abandon protective taxes as against England  --  in other words , abandon that mysterious formula for creating wealth which Mr. Chamberlain so lauds them for making their own ! It is simply to be said that Canada , for example , or Australia , shows no sign whatever of giving up good monopoly profits for any sentimental considerations . Like Sancho Panza , they will take the actual foals of protection in preference to the dubious spoils of Mr. Chamberlain 's next knightly adventure . The Canadians , we suspect , will be particularly offended by his intimation that they ought not to go on developing their " secondary industries , " but should meekly and loyally take everything of that sort from England On this rock of colonial self-interest alone , to say nothing of his economic and financial difficulties , Mr. Chamberlain 's whole scheme might easily go to wreck . NEW LIGHT ON GLADSTONE . John Morley 's long-awaited Life of Mr Gladstone will disappoint no expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weight of judgment , and philosophic impartiality of treatment , with grace and dignity of style , it is a work to be recurred to and meditated upon before a final verdict is ventured . Even a first reading , however , makes plain that it is an illuminating biography , adding much to our knowledge of a great man whose character , like his acts , has been the subject of fierce controversy . It was not , of course , to be anticipated that a great deal that is novel could come to light , in the case of a man whose long life was passed in the full glare of publicity . Mr. Morley 's contribution consists mainly in piecing out old information with new evidence , and in marshalling events in their proper sequence and se tting . He gives us , for example , some interesting pages bearing upon Mr. Glad-stone 's attitude towards the United States . The unfortunate speech of 1862 , asserting that Jefferson Davis and the South had made a " nation , " he himself came to number among his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded upon inadequate knowledge , but was , in any case , an indiscreet utterance to come from a member of the Cabinet without the authorization of his chief . Not so well known is the part that Gladstone played in moderating the demands of Great Britain at the time of the Trent affair . In his note about the meeting of Ministers which decided on the peremptory dispatches to Lord Lyons at Washington , he wrote : " I thought and urged that we should hear what the Americans had to say before withdrawing Lyons , for I could not feel sure that we were at the bottom of the law of the case , or could judge here and now what form it would assume . But this view did not prevail . " However , Mr Gladstone was in high favor at Windsor in those days , and his diary has a suggestive entry concerning the next Cabinet meeting : " Nov. 30 . Left Windsor at 11.25 Cabinet 3-5% . Lord Russell 's draft softened and abridged . " The inference is fair , Mr. Morley argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tion to the court , and that his representations had a good deal to do with the famous intervention of the Queen and the Prince Consort for the purpose of making the demand on the American Government less bellicose in tone . Many other instances might be given of similar lighting up of critical episodes in Mr Gladstone 's career . Majuba Hill , Egypt , the belated attempt to save Gen. Gordon  --  the public records and private memoranda upon which Mr. Morley has drawn enable him to make those violently debated subjects more intelligible , even if not wholly to still the strife of tongues . One calumny he absolutely crushes . This is the assertion that Gladstone never thought of Home Rule for Ireland until he discovered that he needed the Irish vote . The written evidence now adduced should make men ashamed to repeat that old slander . As for the still more foolish invention which credited Mr Morley himself with having converted Gladstone to Home Rule , he contemptuously dismisses it in a footnote as the merest " moonshine . " But the chief question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Does it help us better to understand the man himself ? The extraordinary career which Gladstone ran is known . His gigantic intellectual power not even the bitterest of his enemies ever denied . His astonishing versatility , his personal ascendency , his immense industry , his amazing ability to sway by his eloquence a critical or hostile House of Commons as well as vast popular assemblages about all this we do not need to be told . Where we wish to be better informed is as to the growth and training of his mind , the process of his political convictions , the balance of qualities in his character . Mr. Morley instructs us . He does it by no idolatrous deification of his old leader , but by letting us see him in habit as he was Glad-stone 's perplexing dualism of both mind and soul his biographer does not undertake to conceal . He shows us " the ardent Italian in the custody of a Scotch-man " , the mediaeval schoolman who was at the same time a flaming tribune of democracy . Out of this two-fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Bagehot long ago pointed out , when you have , as you had in Gladstone , a hair-splitting scholastic who is also the leader of the party of change and progress , you are bound to get a statesman who will be accused of sophistry , insincerity , subterfuge , and vacillation . Mr. Morley frankly admits this , and shows us how the fine-spun distinctions which were of the essence of Mr. Gladstone 's mind , exposed him to the gibes of the " plain people " Yet he remained the greategt leader of the plain people that ever arose in England . In the combination lies the mystery of his character . If there was in it the tortuous refining of words out of their natural meaning ? " pure Gladstonese , " it has been called  --  there was also in it a moral elevation and a kindling enthusiasm which made men yield to him though they could not understand him Gladstone 's acknowledged mastery in finance Mr. Morley shows to have been wholly acquired . It has often been supposed that lie was trained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of large affairs . But no , the son came to financial administration protesting that he knew nothing , about " packages . " Trade ( land the Exchequer were not dreamed of in the then philosophy of Oxford . Gladstone 's profound knowledge of the great industries and the ongoing of commerce , with his grasp of money and banking and taxation , he won by the intensity and vigor of his mental application . That was his lifelong-power . Let any subject challenge and arouse him , and the swoop of his intellect upon it was like an eagle 's , and tore facts and principles out of it for his masterful use . It was sheer concentration of mind , not actual experience , which made his budgets seem like the waving of a magician 's wand , and which left the " practical " man who was to be put up to expose his ignorance , shrinking back , and saying , like the brewer member of Parliament who heard Gladstone expound the tax on malt : " It 's no - use ; he knows my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime , Mr. Gladstone passed from party to party , and apparently from conviction to conviction . Wonderfully precocious though he was , he did not appear to find himself , politically , until fifty . But when he did finally break away from the narrowing prejudices of his early education , the one thing which gave impulse and unity to his public life was a passionate love of liberty for all men . With this went his shining advocacy of the doctrine that the principles of morals and religion must have sway in public affairs as imperiously as in private life . That made him the champion of oppressed peoples . That made him , like Falkland , the devoted lover of peace . One of Mr. Morley 's interesting revelations is that Mr. Gladstone 's final retirement from power in 1894 was due to a break with his colleagues over swollen naval estimates . He simply said , with dignity , that his record and the character of a Christian man which he had to sustain , would not permit him to sanction such an outlay . Nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mass of self-revealing letters and journals he left behind him , gives reason to bate a jot of the tribute which his political rival , Lord Salisbury , paid to him when he called him " a great Christian statesman . "
