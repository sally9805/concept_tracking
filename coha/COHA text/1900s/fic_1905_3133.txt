Carter Miss Elizabeth French A Group of Tourists Miss Gertrude Bindley Miss Myrtle Lane ACT I A charming room in the Tillmans ' house . The walls are white woodwork , framing in old tapestries of deep foliage design , with here and there a flaming flamingo ; white furniture with old , green brocade cushions . The room is in the purest Louis XVI . The noon sunlight streams through a window on the left . On the opposite side is a door to the hall . At back double doors open into a corridor which leads to the ballroom . At left centre are double doors to the front hall . A great , luxurious sofa is at the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the room a table has chairs grouped about it . On floral small table are books and objets d'art , and everywhere there is a profusion of white roses and maidenhair fern . In the stage directions Left and Right mean Left and Right of actor , as he faces audience . Three smart-looking SERVANTS are peering through the crack of the folding door , their backs to the audience . The pretty , slender MAID is on a chair . The elderly BUTLER dignifiedly stands on the floor . The plump , overfed little HOUSEMAID is kneeling so as to see beneath the head of the BUTLER . HOUSEMAID . Gasping . Oh , ai n't it a beautiful sight ! BUTLER . Pompously . Not to me who ' ave seen a Lord married in Hengland . MAGGIE . Oh , you make me sick , Mr. Potts , always talking of your English Aristocracy ! I 'm sure there never was no prettier wedding than this . Nor as pretty a bride as Miss Jinny . BUTLER . Correcting her . Mrs. Haustin ! HOUSEMAID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them frosted angels on a Christmas card . My , I wish I could ' a ' seen her go up the aisle with the organ going for all it was worth ! MAGGIE . It was a beautiful sight ! BUTLER . A good many ' appens to be ' aving the sense to be going now . HOUSEMAID . Could you hear Miss Jinny say " I do , " and make them other remarks ? MAGGIE . Yes , plain , though her voice was trembly like . But Mr. Austin he almost shouted ! Laughing nervously in excitement . BUTLER . ' E 's glad to get ' er ! MAGGIE . And her him ! HOUSEMAID . Yes , that 's what I likes about it . Did any one cry ? MAGGIE . Mrs. Tillman . Lots of people are going now . HOUSEMAID . What elegant clothes ! Oh , gosh ! BUTLER . Superciliously . Mrs. Cullingham do n't seem in no ' urry ; she 's a common lot ! MAGGIE . I do n't care , she 's rich and Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any poor person or church or hospital that wants it , or do n't ! So she ca n't be so very common neither , Mr. Potts ! HOUSEMAID . Say , I catch on to something ! Young Mr. Tillman 's sweet on that there tall bridesmaid . MAGGIE . Sharply . Who ? BUTLER . Miss Chester . I 've seen there was something goin ' hon between them whenever she 's dined or lunched ' ere . MAGGIE . Angry . ' Tai n't true ! BUTLER . I 'll bet my month 's wages . MAGGIE . I do n't believe you ! BUTLER . Why , what 's it to you , please ? MAGGIE . Saving herself . Nothing --  HOUSEMAID . Well , I guess it 's truth enough . That 's the second time I 've seen him squeeze her hand when no one was n't lookin ' . MAGGIE . Here , change places with me ! Getting down from her chair . If you was a gentleman , Mr. Potts , you 'd have given me your place ! Witheringly . BUTLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be here ; I 'd be on the other side of the door . He moves the chairs away . MAGGIE . To Housemaid . Honest , you saw something between them ? HOUSEMAID . Who ? MAGGIE . Him and her ? Mr. Geoffrey and Miss Chester --  HOUSEMAID . Cheese it ! they 're coming this way ! She and the MAID and the BUTLER vanish through the door Right . GEOFFREY and RUTH enter through the double doors quickly at back . GEOFFREY is a young , good-looking man , but with a weak face . He is of course very smartly dressed . RUTH is a very serenely beautiful girl , rather noble in type , but unconscious and unpretending in manner . They close the doors quickly behind them . GEOFFREY . We 'll not be interrupted here , and I must have a few words with you before you go . He follows her to the sofa where she sits , and leans over it , with his arm about her shoulder . RUTH . Oh , Geof ,  - -  Geof , why were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be helped , darling ! RUTH . It is n't the big wedding I miss , oh , no , it 's only it seemed sweeter in a church . Why did we have to steal off to Brooklyn , to that poor , strange little preacher in his stuffy back parlour , and behave as if we were doing something of which we were ashamed ? GEOFFREY . You love me , I love you ,  - -  is n't that the chief thing , dearest ? RUTH . But how much longer must we keep it secret ? GEOFFREY . Till I can straighten my affairs out . I ca n't explain it all to you ; there are terrible debts , one more than all the others ,  - -  a debt I made when I was in college . RUTH . If I could only help you ! I have a little money . GEOFFREY . No , I love you too much ; besides , this debt is n't money , and I hope to get rid of it somehow before long . RUTH . Forgive me for worrying you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this wedding except me , dear Jinny brimming over with joy , as I would be ,  - -  and it 's made me feel -- a little --  GEOFFREY . Comes around the sofa and sits beside her . I know , dear , and it 's made me feel what a brute I am ! Oh , if you knew how I hate myself for all I 've done , and for the pain and trouble I cause you now ! MAGGIE , her sharp features set tense , appears in the doorway on the left behind the curtains and listens . RUTH . Never mind , we wo n't think of that any more . GEOFFREY . I can never throw it off , not for a minute ! I 'm a worthless fellow and how can you love me --  RUTH . Interrupting him . I do ! You are worth everything to me , and you will be worth much to the world yet ! GEOFFREY . I love you , Ruth -- that 's the one claim I can make to deserve you . But it 's helped me to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUTH . Softly . Geof ! GEOFFREY . Which I used to think the only things worth living for , and which now , thanks to you , I loathe ,  - -  every one of them . RUTH . I 'm so glad ! I 've been some help , then . GEOFFREY . If I 'd only got you earlier , I 'd have been a different man , Ruth ! RUTH . Smiling and taking his nervous hand in hers . Then I might n't have fallen in love with you if you were a different man ! GEOFFREY . Dear girl ! Anyway , this is the good news that I want to tell you -- I hope now to have things settled in a couple of weeks . RUTH . In glad relief . Geoffrey ! GEOFFREY . But -- I may n't be successful ; it might be , Ruth -- it might be , we would have to wait -- for years --  RUTH . Quietly . I do n't think I could bear that ! It 's not easy for me to lie and deceive as I 've had to the last few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PETER CULLINGHAM enters suddenly , from the ballroom , a pale young man , but , unlike GEOFFREY , hard and virile . PETER . Oh , here you are ! I say , are you two spoony ? Just the way I feel ! Laughing . I caught and hugged old Mrs. Parmby just now ! I think it 's sort of in the air at weddings , do n't you ? GEOFFREY . Rising . I 'm surprised to see you 've left the refreshment table , Peter . PETER . They sent me to find Miss Chester -- they 're going to cut the bridesmaid 's cake , and if you two really are spoony , Miss Chester , you 'd better not miss it -- you might get the ring ! They laugh as PETER takes out a bottle from which he takes a round , black tablet which he puts in his mouth . RUTH . Also rising . I 'd better go . PETER is making frantic efforts to swallow the tablet . GEOFFREY . Noticing him . What 's the matter with you ? PETER . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes , I 've got awful indigestion , and I 'm trying to swallow a charcoal tablet . RUTH . Come with me and get a glass of water . PETER . No , it 's very bad to drink water with your meals ; but I 'll get a piece of bridesmaid 's cake -- that 'll push it down ! PETER and RUTH go out through the double doors . The moment they are out of the room , MAGGIE comes from behind the curtain and goes straight up to GEOFFREY . He looks astonished and frightened . GEOFFREY . What do you want ? Have you been listening ? MAGGIE . So that 's it , is it ? You want to marry her when you can get rid of me . GEOFFREY . With relief . What do you mean ? MAGGIE . Oh , I may not have heard everything , but I heard and saw enough to catch on that you 're in love with Miss Chester . GEOFFREY . Well ? MAGGIE . Well , you wo n't marry her -- I 'll never set you free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MAGGIE . Oh , they 're all in the dining room . GEOFFREY . Angry . What do you want , anyway ? MAGGIE . She pleads a little . When I came here to your house and got a position , it was because I loved you , if you had treated me bad , and I hoped by seeing you again , and being near you , you might come back to me and everything be made straight ! GEOFFREY . Never ! Never ! It 's impossible . MAGGIE . Angry again . Oh , is it ! Well , the dirty little money you give me now only holds my tongue quiet so long 's you behave yourself and do n't run after any other girls ! But the minute you try to throw me down , I 'll come out with the whole story . GEOFFREY . I was drunk when I married you ! MAGGIE . More shame to you ! GEOFFREY . You 're right . But I was only twenty -- and you -- led me on --  MAGGIE . Interrupting him . Me ! led you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there was in New Haven if I do do housework , and that 's my wedding ring and you put it there , and mother 's got the certificate locked up good and safe in her box with my dead baby sister 's hair and the silver plate off my father 's coffin ! GEOFFREY . We must n't talk here any more ! MAGGIE . You look out ! If I was n't so fond of your sister Miss Jinny , and if the old people were n't so good to me , I 'd just show you right up here -- now ! GEOFFREY . I 'll buy you off if I ca n't divorce you ! MAGGIE . You ! Poof ! GIRLS ' voices are heard from the ballroom . GEOFFREY . Look out -- some one 's coming ! MAGGIE . Going . You have n't got a red cent ; my cheque 's always one of your father 's ! She goes out Right . GEOFFREY . Good God ! what am I going to do -- shoot myself , if I do n't get out of this soon -- I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens the double doors , looks in , and then enters . She is an adorable little human being , pretty , high-strung , temperamental , full of certain feminine fascination that defies analysis , which is partly due to the few faults she possesses . She is , of course , dressed in the conventional wedding-dress , a tulle veil thrown over her face . JINNY . Not a soul ! Come on ! She is followed in by the four BRIDESMAIDS -- nice girls every one of them -- and also , very slyly , by SUSIE , a very modern spoiled child , who sits unobserved out of the way at the back . Now , my dears , I wish to say good-by all by ourselves so I can make you a little speech ! All laugh gently . In the first place I want to tell you that there 's nothing like marriage ! And you must every one of you try it ! Really , I was never so happy in my life ! GRACE . Must we stand , or may we sit down ? JINNY . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll only crush your lovely frocks . In fact , I advise you not to lose any time sitting down again until you 've got the happy day fixed ! RUTH . You know , Jinny darling , that there is no one so glad for your happiness as your four bridesmaids are -- is n't that so , girls ? ALL . Yes ! And they all together embrace JINNY , saying , " Dear old Jinny , " " Darling Jinny , " " We 'll miss you dreadfully , " etc. , ad lib. , till they get tearful . JINNY . Good gracious , girls , we must n't cry . I 'll get red eyes , and Jack 'll think what an awful difference just the marriage service makes in a woman . The doors at the back open , and AUSTIN appears in the doorway . AUSTIN is a typical New Yorker in appearance , thirty-two years old , good-looking , manly , self-poised , and somewhat phlegmatic in temperament . AUSTIN . Hello ! May a mere man come in to this delectable tea party ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till I call you ! AUSTIN . Amused . Thank you ! He goes out , closing the door . GERTRUDE . We 'll miss you so awfully , Jinny . JINNY . Just what I say ! Get a man to keep you company , and then you wo n't miss any one . BELLE . Yes , but attractive men with lots of money do n't come into the Grand Central Station by every train ! JINNY . Putting her arm about her . You want too much , my dear Belle ! And you are n't watching the Grand Central Station either half so much as you are the steamer docks for a suitable person . Now do n't be angry ; you know you want a good big title , and you 've got the money to pay , but , my dear Belle , it 's those ideas of yours that have kept you single till -- twenty-six !  - -  now that you must confess was nice of me , to take off three years ! BELLE . Laughing . Jinny , you 're horrid ! JINNY . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of you , or you would n't be my bridesmaid to-day ; it 's only that I want your wedding to be as happy as mine -- that 's all , and here 's a little gift for you to remember your disagreeable but loving friend by ! Giving her a small jewelry box . BELLE . Thank you , Jinny ! Thank you ! A little moved . GRACE . Mercy ! I hope you 're not going to take each one of us ! JINNY . I am , and come here , you 're next ! GRACE . I 'll swear I do n't want to get married at all ! JINNY . Do n't be silly , you icicle ! Of course you do n't ; you freeze all the men away , so that you 've no idea how nice and comfy they can be ! My advice to you , Grace darling ,  - -  and I love you , or I would n't bother ,  - -  is to thaw ! Laughs . I used to be awfully jealous of you --  GRACE . Interrupting . Oh ! JINNY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . GRACE . Jinny ! JINNY . You are ! But I got over it because I soon saw you were so cold , there was no danger of any conflagration near you ! Oh , I 've watched your eyes often to see if any man had lighted the fires in them yet . And now I 'm determined they shall be lighted . You 're too cold ! Thaw , dear , not to everybody ,  - -  that would be like slushy weather , but do n't keep yourself so continually so far below zero that you wo n't have time to strike -- well -- say eighty-five in the shade , when the right bit of masculine sunshine does come along ! Here -- with my best love ! Giving her a small jewelry box . GRACE kisses JINNY . GERTRUDE . I am the next victim , I believe ! JINNY . All I 've got to say to you , Miss , is , that if you do n't decide pretty soon on one of the half dozen men you are flirting with disgracefully at present , they 'll every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for widowers . GERTRUDE . Mockingly . Horrors ! JINNY . Oh , I do n't know ! I suppose a widower is sort of broken in and would be more likely to put up with your caprices ! For the sake of your charm and wit and true heart underneath it all , you dear old girl you ! Giving her a small jewel box . GERTRUDE . Thank you , Jinny . I 'm only afraid I will do the wrong thing with you away ! You know you 're always my ballast ! JINNY . Nonsense ! Female ballast is no good ; masculine ballast is the only kind that 's safe if you want to make life 's journey in a love balloon . SHE turns to RUTH CHESTER . Ruth -- the trouble with you is , you 're too sad lately , and show such a lack of interest . I should think you might be in love , only I have n't been able to find the man . Anyway , if you are n't in love , you must pretend an interest in things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do n't like you to talk about them , so it 's really very easy . All you have to do is listen , stare them straight in the eyes , think of whatever you like , and look pleased ! It does flatter them , and they think they are interesting , and you charming ! Wear this , and think of me ! Giving her a box. and be happy ! I want you to be happy -- and I can see you are n't ! RUTH . Kissing her . Thank you , dear ! JINNY . There , that 's all !  - -  except - -  when I come home from abroad in October , if every one of you are n't engaged to be married , I 'll wash my hands of you --  They all laugh . SUSIE , sliding off her chair at back , comes forward . SUSIE . Now , it 's my turn ! You ca n't chuck me ! JINNY . Trying not to laugh . Susie ! where did you come from and what do you mean ? SUSIE . Oh , you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to-day , too -- what 's the matter with telling me how to get married ! JINNY . I 'll tell you this , your language is dreadful ; where do you get all the boy 's slang ? You do n't talk like a lady . SUSIE . I 'm not a lady . I 'm a little girl ! JINNY . You talk much more like a common boy . SUSIE . Well , I 'd rather be a boy ! JINNY . Susie , I shall tell Aunt Laura her daughter needs looking after . SUSIE . Oh , very well , cousin Jinny . If you 're going to make trouble , why , forget it ! Turns and goes out haughtily , Right . JINNY . Going to the double doors , calls . Now you can come in , Jack . AUSTIN enters . AUSTIN . And now I 've only time to say good-by . All your guests have gone except the Cullinghams , who are upstairs with your mother , looking at the presents . GERTRUDE . Come ! All hands around him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre . BELLE . We do n't care if every one else has gone or not , we 're here yet ! AUSTIN . So I see ! But I am ordered by my father-in-law -- ahem ! all laugh to go to my room , or he thinks there will be danger of our losing our train . ALL THE BRIDESMAIDS . Ad lib . Where are you going ? Where are you going ? We wo n't let you out till you tell us . AUSTIN . I daren't -- I 'm afraid of my wife ! JINNY . Bravo , Jack ! GRACE . Very well , then , we 'll let you out , on one condition , that you kiss us all in turn . The GIRLS laugh . JINNY . No ! No ! Breaking away . He sha n't do any such thing ! They all laugh and break up the ring . GERTRUDE . Dear me , is n't she jealous ! BELLE . Yes , it is evidently time we all went ! Good-by , Jinny ! Kissing her . A happy journey to Washington ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JINNY begins with RUTH at one end , and AUSTIN at the other ; he says good-by and shakes hands with each girl . GERTRUDE . Kissing JINNY . Good-by , and a pleasant trip to Niagara Falls ! JINNY . Not a bit ! GRACE . Kissing JINNY . Good-by , I believe it 's Boston or Chicago ! JINNY . Neither ! RUTH . Good-by , dear , and all the happiness in the world ! Kisses her . JINNY . Thank you . She turns and goes with the other three girls to the double doors at back , where they are heard talking . RUTH . Mr. Austin ? AUSTIN . Yes ? Joining her . RUTH . Embarrassed . You like your new brother , do n't you ? AUSTIN . Geof ? most certainly I do , and Jinny adores him . RUTH . I know , then , you 'll be a good friend to him if he needs one . AUSTIN . Surely I will . RUTH . I think he does need one . AUSTIN . Really --  The GIRLS are passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth . THEY pass out and JINNY stands in the doorway talking to them till they are out of hearing . RUTH . Sh ! please do n't tell any one , not even Jinny , what I 've said ! I may be betraying something I 've no right to do , and do n't tell him I 've spoken to you . AUSTIN . All right ! JINNY turns around in the doorway . RUTH . Thank you -- and good-by . Shaking his hand again . JINNY notices that they shake hands twice . A queer little look comes into her face . AUSTIN . Good-by . RUTH . Have they gone ?  - -  Oh ! Hurrying past JINNY . Good-by , dear . She goes out through the double doors . JINNY . In a curious little voice . Good-by .... She comes slowly down the room toward AUSTIN , and smiles at him quizzically . What were you two saying ? AUSTIN . Good-by ! JINNY . But you 'd said it once to her already ! Why did you have to say good-by twice to Ruth ? Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banteringly . The first time I said good-by to her , and the second time she said good-by to me ! JINNY . Do you know what I believe -- Ruth Chester 's in love with you ! AUSTIN . Oh , darling ! Laughs . JINNY . Yes , that explains the whole thing . No wonder she was triste to-day . AUSTIN . Laughing . Jinny , sweetheart , do n't get such an absurd notion into your head . JINNY . Looks straight at him a moment , then speaks tenderly . No -- no -- I know it 's not your fault . There was no other woman in this house for you to-day but me , was there ? AUSTIN . There was no other woman in the world for me since the first week I knew you . Taking her into his arms . JINNY . This is good-by to Jinny Tillman ! He kisses her . Jack , darling , do you think I could sit on your knee like a little child and put my arm around your neck and rest my head on your shoulder for just five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Oh ! Shuts the door very quickly and knocks . JINNY and AUSTIN laugh . JINNY . Yes , yes -- come in ! MRS . CULLINGHAM enters . She is a handsome , whole-souled , florid woman ; one of those creatures of inexhaustible vitality who make people of a nervous temperament tired almost on contact by sheer contrast . She is the kindest , best meaning creature in the world . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Oh , do excuse me ! I have n't any more tact !  - -  and I hate to interrupt you , but I must say good-by . Calls . Peter ! PETER . Yes 'm . Entering with a glass of water and a powder . He sits in the arm-chair at right , and constantly looks at his watch . AUSTIN . I 'm much obliged to you , Mrs. Cullingham , for the interruption , as I was sent long ago to make myself ready for the train , if you 'll excuse me ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Certainly ! JINNY . Good-by ! Taking his hand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Right . MRS . CULLINGHAM . If it 's time for him , it 's certainly time for you . I wo n't keep you a minute ! JINNY . No , really we 've plenty of time ,  --  both sit on sofa . Was n't it a lovely wedding ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . I never saw a sweeter , my dear ! And it was perfectly elegant ! Simply great ! JINNY . And is n't Jack --  MRS . CULLINGHAM . He is ! And so are you ! In fact I 've been telling your mother I do n't know how to thank you both . You 've asked me to-day to meet the swellest crowd I 've ever been in where I was invited , and did n't have to buy tickets , and felt I had a right to say something besides " excuse me , " and " I beg your pardon . " Of course , I 've sat next to them all before in restaurants and at concerts , but this time I felt like the real thing myself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband ever want any mining tips , come to me ; what my husband do n't know about mines is n't worth knowing ! JINNY . I 'm as glad as I can be if you 've had a good time , and you must n't feel indebted to us . Ever since we met in Egypt that winter , mamma and I have always felt you were one of our best friends . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Of course you know it is n't for my own sake I 'm doing these stunts to get into Society . It 's all for my boy . He 's got to have the best -- or the worst , however you look at it ! Laughing . Anyway , I want him to have a chance at it , and it belongs to him through his father , for my first husband was a real swell ! Looking at PETER lovingly . At this moment , PETER , having again looked at his watch , tips up the powder on his tongue , and swallows it down with the water . MRS . CULLINGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's an alkali powder he takes twenty minutes after eating . Peter , we must say good-by now . PETER . Coming up . Good-by , Miss Jinny . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Mrs. Austin ! JINNY . Oh , I 'll always be " Miss Jinny " to Peter ! PETER . Thank you ! We 've had a great time at your wedding ! Bully food ! But I 'm feeling it ! He turns aside . Excuse me ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . I was just telling Mrs. Austin --  Interrupted . JINNY . " Jinny "  - -  do n't change . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Thank you --  Rises to go . I was just saying we wo n't forget in our social life , will we , Peter , that Miss Jinny gave us the biggest boost up we 've had yet ? JINNY also rises . PETER . Well , you know , mother , I do n't think the game 's worth the candle . It 's begun to pall on me already . MRS . CULLINGHAM . I really think he 's going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your sake .

She 'll be late if she is n't careful . JINNY . I 'm going to . Is Maggie there ? MRS . TILLMAN . Yes , waiting ! JINNY . Good-by . Kisses MRS . CULLINGHAM . Good-by . Shakes PETER 'S hand . PETER . Many happy returns ! JINNY goes out Right . MRS . TILLMAN . Come , I want to give you some of Jinny 's flowers to take home with you . Would you like some ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . I should love them ! They go out through the doors at back . PETER is suffering with indigestion . He takes a charcoal tablet , and SUSIE cautiously enters Right . SUSIE . There you are ! Have you got ' em ? PETER . No , I gave them back to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em quick , the trunks are coming down now ! PETER goes out quickly at back , as the BUTLER and MAN SERVANT enter Right , carrying a large new trunk with a portmanteau on top of it . SUSIE . Put them right over there for a minute ! They put them down in the centre of the room , and the FOOTMAN goes out Right . And mind , you do n't split on us , Thomas . Auntie Tillman knows all about it -- it 's just to be a nice little surprise for Cousin Jinny and my new uncle . BUTLER . Very well , miss . He also goes out Right . At the same time PETER reenters at back with a roll of papers and some broad white satin ribbon . The papers are about half a foot broad and two feet long , and on them is printed , " We are on our honeymoon . " PETER . With gay excitement . I 've got ' em . SUSIE .

He goes out Left . As PETER reenters from the back , with the water . SUSIE . Quick now ! Quick ! They stick one label on the big steamer trunk facing the audience . PETER . I say is n't that great ! SUSIE giggles aloud with delight . The BUTLER , standing at one side , smiles . They put another label on the other trunk . SUSIE . Giggling .

Now , James , you 're to go over with the luggage to Twenty-third Street Ferry and check the heavy baggage ; you know where to . FOOTMAN . Yes , sir . SUSIE . Eagerly . Oh , where to ? BUTLER . I am hunder hoath not to tell , Miss . SUSIE . O pish ! Kneeling in the big arm-chair and watching proceedings from behind its back . BUTLER . Continues to the FOOTMAN . And wait with the checks and Mr. Austin 's dressing-bag --  Showing it.  - -  until they come . FOOTMAN . Yes , sir . PETER . And make haste , or , I say , somebody 'll turn up and give our whole joke away ! The DRIVER reenters . SUSIE . Yes , do hurry ! FOOTMAN . To the DRIVER . Come along . They take the big trunk out Left . BUTLER follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room at back . Peter darling , are you there ? SUSIE . Phew ! Just in time ! Sliding down into a more correct position in the chair . PETER . Yes , mother ! Going to back . MRS . CULLINGHAM . In the doorway , at back . Come , take these beautiful roses from Mrs. Tillman ! MRS . CULLINGHAM and MRS . TILLMAN enter . MRS . TILLMAN . With her arms full of roses . Thomas will take them down . PETER . No , I 'd like to . Are n't they bully ? He takes them . MRS . CULLINGHAM . To MRS . TILLMAN . Good-by , and thank you again . I know you must want to go up to Jinny . MRS . TILLMAN . Yes , she may need me to help her a little . Good-by . Good-by , Peter . PETER . Good-by , ma 'm . MRS . TILLMAN goes out Right . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Why , Susie , how do you do ? SUSIE . Glides out of the chair and stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . CULLINGHAM . You 're a good little girl , I hope ? SUSIE . I do n't ! I hate good little girls ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . O my ! She goes out , laughing , Left . PETER , coming to SUSIE , catches her in his arms and kisses her , much against her will . SUSIE . Furious . Oh , you horrid , nasty thing , you ! She strikes at him ; he runs ; she chases him from one side of the room to the other , around a sofa and table , and out Left , screaming as she chases him . I hate you ! I hate you ! MAGGIE enters Right . MAGGIE . Miss Susie , Mrs. Tillman wants to see you upstairs . SUSIE . What for ? MAGGIE . I do n't know , Miss . SUSIE . Pshaw ! have I got to go ? All right ! Going toward the door at Right . AUSTIN enters , meeting SUSIE . AUSTIN . Hello ! Where are you going ? SUSIE . Oh , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it 's an awful bore ! Want to come along ? AUSTIN . No , thank you ; but if you see your Cousin Jinny , you might tell her I am down . SUSIE . Hanging on to him . I say ! Where are you and Cousin Jinny going to , anyway ? AUSTIN . Smiling . I do n't know . SUSIE . O my , what a fib ! And that 's a nice example to set a little girl ! She goes out Right . MAGGIE . Coming forward . I beg pardon , sir , but may I speak to you a minute ? AUSTIN . Certainly , Maggie , what is it ? MAGGIE . I 've been trying for a chance to see you alone . I would n't bother you , sir -- but it 's only because I 'm fond of Miss Jinny , and of Mr. and Mrs. Tillman , and they 've all been so good to me ; I know it would nearly kill ' em if they knew . AUSTIN . Come , Maggie , knew what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been good to me , sir . From this point her feelings begin to get the better of her and she speaks rapidly and hysterically . He 's been bad , bad as he could , and somebody 's got to talk to him , and I do n't see who 's a-goin ' to do it but you . If he do n't change , I 'll not hold my tongue any longer . It 's all I can do for their sakes to hold it now ! AUSTIN . Look here , what are you talking about ? You do n't mean Mr. Geoffrey ? MAGGIE . Yes , I do , sir ; he 's my husband . AUSTIN . What ! ! MAGGIE . We was married when he was at Yale , sir ; I was in a shop there . AUSTIN . But --  ! Well , after all , is n't this your and Geoffrey 's affair ? Why bring me in ? MAGGIE . Because he 's making love to Miss Chester , and promising to marry her now , and if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 's married to you , as you say -- he ca n't marry -- any one else . MAGGIE . He 's tried to make me believe our marriage ai n't legal , because he was only twenty and he 'd been drinking ! AUSTIN . What makes you think Mr. Geoffrey cares for -- Miss Chester ? MAGGIE . I just heard and see him making love to her here ! AUSTIN . This is a pretty bad story , Maggie . MAGGIE . Yes , sir , and the worst is , sir , I know I ai n't good enough for him , and that 's why I 've kept still about it these three years , but I ca n't help loving him no matter how ugly he 's treated me . Breaking down into tears . I just ca n't help it ! I love him , sir , even if I 'm only a servant girl , and I ca n't stand it thinking he 's going to try and get rid of me for some one else ! She sobs out loud . AUSTIN . Sh !  - -  Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody 'll hear you , and besides they 'll be coming down presently . I 'll have a talk with Mr. Geoffrey when I come back --  Interrupted as GEOFFREY enters Left . He does n't see MAGGIE , who is collapsed in a corner of the sofa . GEOFFREY . To AUSTIN . Ah ! Thank goodness I 've caught you ; I had an awful headache and went out for a breath of air , and then I was afraid I might have missed you ! I knew in that case Jinny would never forgive me , nor -- I -- myself -- for that -- matter --  His voice grows less exuberant in the middle of his speech and finally at the end almost dies away , as he sees the expression in AUSTIN 'S face and realizes that something is wrong somewhere . When he stops speaking , MAGGIE gives a gasping sob . He hears it , and starting , sees her . GEOFFREY . Maggie ! AUSTIN . Geoffrey , is what this girl says true ? GEOFFREY . That I married her in New Haven ? Yes . MAGGIE . Rises . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , go , Maggie ; it 's better . MAGGIE goes out Right . GEOFFREY . As soon as she is out of the room . Promise me , Jack , you wo n't tell any one ! It 's awful , I know ! For two years at college I went all to pieces and led a rotten life ,  - -  and one night , drunk , I married her , and it is n't so much her fault . I suppose she thought I loved her ,  - -  but this would break up the old lady and gentleman so , if they knew , I could n't stand it ! And Jinny , for God 's sake , do n't tell Jinny . She respects me . You wo n't tell her , will you ? AUSTIN . No . But Maggie says you want to marry some one else now . GEOFFREY . With a change , in great shame . That 's true , too . He sits in utter dejection on the sofa . AUSTIN . How are you going to do it ? GEOFFREY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUSTIN . Yes , go out to Sioux Falls , get a divorce there on respectable grounds , and settle a sum of money on Maggie . GEOFFREY . But I ca n't do that ! AUSTIN . Why not ? GEOFFREY . I ca n't do anything that would give publicity , and that divorce would . AUSTIN . Any divorce would ; you ca n't get rid of that . GEOFFREY . I tell you I ca n't have publicity . Ruth -- Miss Chester -- would hear of it . AUSTIN . Well , if she loves you , she 'll forgive your wild oats , especially as every one sees now what a steady , straight fellow you 've become . GEOFFREY . It 's Ruth ! But I ca n't do that . No , Jack , you must help -- you will , wo n't you ? Oh , do , for Jinny 's sake ! Help me to persuade Maggie to keep silent for good , tear up that certificate of marriage . I was only twenty ; it 's hardly legal , and I 'll settle a good sum --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand heavily on his shoulder . Good God , you 're proposing bigamy ! You 've done enough ; do n't stoop to crime ! The two MEN face each other a moment . GEOFFREY 'S head drops . AUSTIN . Forget you ever said that ; do what I tell you when Jinny and I have gone abroad , so she will be away from it a little , and if you want money , let me know . JINNY enters Right , with nervous gaiety , covering an upheaving emotion which is very near the surface . JINNY . Ready ! And there you are , Geof . I 've been sending all over the house after you ! Good-by ! Throwing her arms about him . Dear old Geof ! Have n't we had good times together ! Always , always from the youngest days I can remember -- I do n't believe there were ever a brother and sister so sympathetic ; I know there was never a brother such a perfect darling as you were -- I 'll miss you , Geof ! The tears come into her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry at all if I could n't marry you , and I do think he is the only man in the world who could have taken me away from home , so long as you were there ! To AUSTIN , smiling . You are n't jealous ? AUSTIN . No ! JINNY . In jest . Is n't it awful ! You ca n't make him jealous ! I think it 's a positive flaw in his character ! Not like -- us , is he ? GEOFFREY . Dear old girl --  JINNY . Whispers to him . And I 've noticed how you 've overcome certain things , dear Geof . I know it 's been hard , and I 'm proud of you . GEOFFREY . Sh ! Jinny , dear old sister ! I 'll miss you ! By George , Jin , the house 'll be awful without -- but you --  His voice grows husky.  - -  just excuse me a minute ! He is about to break down , and so hurries out Right . JINNY . Sniffling . He was going to cry ! Oh , Jack , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know he 's been awfully dissipated , and he 's changed it all , all by himself ! If he should go wrong again -- I believe it would break my heart , I love him so ! AUSTIN . I 'll do more for him , if he ever needs me , than if he were my own brother , because he 's yours ! JINNY . Presses his hand and looks up at him lovingly and gratefully . Thank you . Wait here just a minute ; I know he wo n't come back to say good-by . He 's gone up to his room , I 'm sure -- I 'll just surprise him with a hug and my hands over his eyes like we used to do years ago . She starts to go out Right , and meets MR. and MRS . TILLMAN , who enter . TILLMAN . The carriage is here ! JINNY . I wo n't be a second --  She goes out Right . MRS . TILLMAN . Where has she gone ? AUSTIN . Up to her brother . MRS . TILLMAN . Her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says thinking , but to me his eyes look very suspicious ! Taking her husband 's arm affectionately . TILLMAN . Clears his throat . Nonsense ! MRS . TILLMAN . Well , how many cigars did you smoke ? TILLMAN . Eight . MRS . TILLMAN . The amount of emotion that a man can soak out of himself with tobacco is wonderful ! He uses it just like a sponge ! TILLMAN . Jack , the first thing I asked about you when I heard that -- er -- that things were getting this way was , does he smoke ? A man who smokes has always that outlet . If things go wrong -- go out and smoke a cigar , and when the cigar 's finished , ten to one everything 's got right , somehow ! If you lose your temper , do n't speak !  - -  a cigar , and when it 's finished , then speak ! You 'll find the temper all gone up in the smoke ! A woman 's happiness is safest with a man who smokes . He clears his throat , which is filling . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our only girl , you know . She 's been a great joy -- ahem ! He quickly gets out a cigar . MRS . TILLMAN . Stopping him from smoking . No , no , dear , they 're going now ! TILLMAN . Well , the best I can say is , I wish you as happy a married life as her mother and I have had . MRS . TILLMAN . Thirty-five dear years ! But now , George , let me say a word -- you always have monopolized our new son -- he 'll be much fonder of you than me ! TILLMAN . Old lady !  - -  Jealous !  --  MRS . TILLMAN . Turn about is fair play -- you 're jealous still of Jinny and me . She pauses a moment . I think we 'd better tell him ! TILLMAN . All right . The only rifts in our lute , Jack , have been little threads of jealousy that have snapped sometimes ! MRS . TILLMAN . Nothing ever serious -- of course , but it 's a fault that Jinny shares with us , and the only fault we 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years the girl with the green eyes . She goes it pretty strong sometimes ! AUSTIN . Oh , that 's all right -- I shall like it ! MRS . TILLMAN . You 'll always bear with her , wo n't you , if she should ever get jealous of you ? AUSTIN . Of me ? I 'll never give her the chance . MRS . TILLMAN . It is n't a question of chance ; you just ca n't help it sometimes , can you , George ? TILLMAN . No , you ca n't . MRS . TILLMAN . And so --  AUSTIN . Do n't worry ! Your daughter 's safe with me . I 'm not the jealous sort myself and I love Jinny so completely , so calmly , and yet with my heart , and soul , and mind , and body , she 'll never have a chance even to try to be jealous of me ! TILLMAN . Sh ! JINNY enters Right . JINNY . I found poor Maggie up in my room crying ! She says she ca n't bear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now she would n't come with me as maid -- and I said good-by to cook and she sniffed ! AUSTIN looks at his watch . AUSTIN . Oh ! we ought to go ! MRS . TILLMAN . Good-by , darling ! Kissing JINNY and embracing her a long time , while AUSTIN and TILLMAN shake hands warmly and say good-by . JINNY . Going to her father . Good-by , father . Dear old father ! With happy emotion . AUSTIN meanwhile is shaking hands with MRS . TILLMAN . JINNY . Returns to her mother . Darling -- oh , how good you 've always been to me ! Oh , mummy darling , I shall miss you ! You 'll send me a letter to-morrow , wo n't you , or a telegram ? Send a telegram -- you 've got the address ! MRS . TILLMAN . With tears in her eyes . Yes , it 's written down ! JINNY . You can tell father , but no one else ! Hugs and kisses her mother . TILLMAN . Come , Susan ! They 'll lose their train ! JINNY again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JINNY , starting to go with AUSTIN , suddenly leaves him and runs back again to her mother and throws herself in her arms . They embrace , in tears . JINNY . Good-by , mother ! MRS . TILLMAN . Good-by , my darling ! TILLMAN . Come , come ! they 'll lose their train ! JINNY runs to AUSTIN , and with his arms about her , they hurry to the door Left . They go through the doors at back to window in the corridor . JINNY stops at the door and she and AUSTIN face each other a moment . JINNY . Looking up at him . Oh , Jack ! She throws her arms about his neck and buries her face on his shoulder . AUSTIN . Jinny , Jinny dear , you 're not sorry ? JINNY . Slowly raises her head and looks at him , smiling through her tears , and speaks in a voice full of tears and little sobs . Sorry ? Oh , no ! Oh , no ! It hurts me to leave them , but I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they hurry out , with his arm about her . MRS . TILLMAN . In the corridor , lifts the window . I hear the door --  TILLMAN . There they are ! SUSIE rushes across the stage with a bowl of rice in her arms and goes out Left . MR. and MRS . TILLMAN wave and say " Good-by ! " " Good-by ! " " Good-by ! " They close the window in silence . The sound is heard as the window frame reaches the bottom . They turn and come slowly forward , TILLMAN wiping his eyes and MRS . TILLMAN biting her lips to keep the tears back . They come into the front room and stop , and for a second they look around the empty room . TILLMAN puts his hand in his pocket and takes out his cigar case . MRS . TILLMAN , turning , sees him ; she goes to him swiftly and touches his arm , looking up at him through her tears . He turns to her and slowly takes her in his arms and holds her there close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left , with empty bowl , sobbing aloud , as THE CURTAIN FALLS ACT II ( Two months later ) The Vatican , Rome ; the Tribune of the Apollo Belvedere ; a semicircular room with dark red walls ; in the centre is the large statue of Apollo . There are doorways at Right and Left . There is a bench on the right side of the room . A single LADY TOURIST enters Right , takes a hasty glance , yawns , and looking down at her Baedeker , goes out Left . A PAPAL GUARD is seen passing outside in the court . A FRENCHMAN and his WIFE ( with Baedekers ) are seen approaching ; they are heard talking volubly . They enter Left . BOTH . Ah !  --  They stand a moment in silent admiration . HE . Reading from Baedeker . Apollo Belvedere . He looks up . C'est superb ! SHE . Beaming with admiration . Magnifique ! Voila un homme ! HE . Quelle grace ! SHE . Quelle force ! Both talk at once in great admiration and intense excitement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary tone and manner . HE . Allons , allons nous ! SHE . In the same tone . Oui , j'ai faim ! They go out Right . JINNY and AUSTIN enter Left , he looking over his shoulder . They stand a moment just inside the doorway . JINNY . What are you looking back so much for , Jackie ? AUSTIN . I thought I saw some one I know . JINNY . Who ? AUSTIN . I did n't know who ; it just seemed to be a familiar back . JINNY . Playfully . Oh , come ! I think the present works of art and your loving wife are quite enough for you to look at without hunting around for familiar backs ! AUSTIN . And Baedeker ! Reading from Baedeker about the Apollo . Apollo Belvedere , found at the end of the fifteenth century , probably in a Roman villa --  JINNY . Of course , Apollo ! AUSTIN . Great , is n't it ? JINNY . Stunning ! She turns and looks at him , smiling quizzically . Still -- but I suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JINNY . You dear old stupid ! You know , Jack , you 're deeply and fundamentally clever and brilliant , but you 're not quite --  bright --  not quick ! Laughing . AUSTIN . Do n't you think having one in the family quick as chain lightning is enough ? What have I missed this time , Jinny ? You do n't mean you 've found a family likeness in the statue over there ? I do n't want to be unappreciative , but it does n't suggest your father to me in the least ,  - -  nor even Geoffrey . JINNY . Stupid ! ! Of course it does n't suggest anybody to me -- I was only thinking I sympathized with Mrs. Perkins of Boston ,  - -  do n't you know the old story about her ? AUSTIN . No , what was it ? JINNY . After a quick look around to see that they are alone . Well -- Mrs . Perkins from Boston was personally conducted here once and shown this very statue , and she looked at it for a few moments , and then turned around and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins ! " AUSTIN . Jinny ! Laughing . JINNY . Are you shocked ? Come , I 'm tired ; let 's sit down here and read my letters -- there 's one from Geof . They sit on the bench at Right , and JINNY takes out a letter from GEOFFREY . AUSTIN . I 'll read ahead in Baedeker and you tell me if there 's any news . He opens the Baedeker and reads , and she opens and reads the letter . Where is Geof 's letter from ? JINNY . New York , of course ; where else would it be ? AUSTIN . I had an idea he was going away . JINNY . Geof ! Where ? AUSTIN . West , a good way somewhere . JINNY . But why would he go West ? AUSTIN . Oh , he had some business , I believe ; I remember thinking it was a good idea when he told me . It was the day we were married -- I was waiting for you to come downstairs . JINNY . I think it 's very funny Geof never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , what time had you ? You were getting married ! ! JINNY . I was ! Thank heaven ! I 'm so happy , Jack ! Snuggling up to him on the bench . AUSTIN . Steals a little , quick hug with his arm about her waist . Bless you , darling , I do n't think there was ever a man as happy as I am ! They start apart quickly as a GERMAN COUPLE enter Right , with a YOUNG DAUGHTER , who is munching a cake , and hanging , a tired and unwilling victim , to her mother 's hand . WOMAN . Ach ! schoen ! sehr schoen ! ! MAN . Groesses , nicht ? WOMAN . Yah ! They stand admiring . AUSTIN . By the way , when you answer your brother 's letter , I wish you 'd say I seemed surprised he was still in New York . JINNY . Reading . Um -- um --  MAN . Wiping his warm brow . Wunderbaum ! WOMAN . Yah ! ! They go out Left , talking . JINNY . Looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? AUSTIN . That you 're the sweetest woman in the world . JINNY . No , darling , I mean who do you think Geoffrey says is over here and in Italy ? AUSTIN . I have n't the most remote idea ! So far as I 've been able to observe there has been absolutely no one in Italy but you and me . JINNY . If you keep on talking like that , I shall kiss you ! AUSTIN . What ! before the tall , white gentleman ? Motioning to Apollo . I am dumb . JINNY . Very lovingly . Silly ! Well !  - -  Mrs . Cullingham and Peter are over here and have brought Ruth Chester ! AUSTIN . Speaking without thinking . Then it was her back . JINNY . With the smallest sharpening of the look in her eye . When ? AUSTIN . That I saw just now . JINNY . With the tiniest suggestion of a strain in her voice . You said you did n't know whom it reminded you of . AUSTIN . Yes , I know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Ruth Chester , why not have said so ? AUSTIN . No reason , dear , I simply did n't think . JINNY . Well --  Sententiously.  - -  next time -- think ! AUSTIN . What else does Geoffrey say ? JINNY . Oh , nothing . The heat for two days was frightful -- already they miss me more than he can say --  Interrupted . AUSTIN . I 'll bet . JINNY . Father smoked nineteen cigars a day the first week I was gone . AUSTIN . I have n't had to smoke any ! JINNY . Mercy ! do n't boast !  - -  and he thinks they will all soon go to Long Island for the summer . AUSTIN . Does n't he say a word nor a hint at his going West ? JINNY . No , he says he may go to Newport for August , and that 's all . Putting away letter , and getting out others . AUSTIN . Going to read all those ? JINNY . If you do n't mind , while I rest . Do you mind ? AUSTIN . Of course not , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little turn and see if I ca n't come across the Cullinghams . Rising . JINNY . After the merest second 's pause , and looking seriously at him . Why do n't you ? AUSTIN . I 'll bring them here if I find them --  He goes out Right . JINNY looks up where he went off and gazes , motionless , for a few moments . Then she throws off the mood and opens a letter . Two tired Americans enter Right , a girl and her mother , MRS . LOPP and CARRIE . MRS . LOPP . What 's this , Carrie ? CARRIE . Looking in her Baedeker . I do n't know ; I 've sort of lost my place , somehow ! MRS . LOPP . Well , we must be in Room No. 3 or 4 -- ai n't we ? CARRIE . Reads out . The big statue at the end of Room No. 3 is Diana the Huntress . MRS . LOPP . This must be it , then ,  - -  Diana ! Strong-looking woman , ai n't she ? CARRIE . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would n't let the men see her bathe . MRS . LOPP . Mercy , Carrie ! and did all the other goddesses ? I do n't think much of their habits . I suppose this is the same person those Italians sell on the streets at home , and call the Bather . JINNY is secretly very much amused , finally she speaks . JINNY . Excuse me , but you are in one of the cabinets -- and this is the Apollo Belvedere . MRS . LOPP . Oh , thank you very much . I guess we 've got mixed up with the rooms ,  - -  seems as if there 's so many . CARRIE . Triumphantly . There ! I thought it was a man all the time ! MRS . LOPP . Well , what with so many of the statues only being piecemeal , as it were , and so many of the men having kinder women 's hair , I declare it seems as if I do n't know the ladies from the gentlemen half the time . CARRIE . Did the rest of us go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARRIE . Thirty-four people with a gassy guide ? We got so tired hearing him talk that we jes ' sneaked off by ourselves , and now we 're a little scared about getting home ; we belong to the Cook 's Gentlemen and Ladies . JINNY . Oh , no , the others have n't passed through here ; probably they have gone to see the pictures ; you 'd better go back and keep asking the attendants the way to the pictures till you get there . MRS . LOPP . With rather subdued voice . Thank you ! We 've come to do Europe and the Holy Land in five weeks for $400 -- but I do n't know , seems as if I 'm getting awful tired -- after jes ' sevin days . CARRIE . Affectionately . Now , mommer , do n't give up ; it 's because you have n't got over being seasick yet ; that 's all ! JINNY . Helplessly . Oh , yes , you 'll find it much less tiring in a few days , I 'm sure . MRS . LOPP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 'll we ask for the pictures ? CARRIE . Why , mommer ! " Tableaux ! " " Tableaux ! " I should think you 'd ' a ' learned that from our church entertainments ! Good-by ; thank you ever so much . MRS . LOPP . You have n't lost your party , too , have you ? JINNY . Smiling . I hope not ! He promised to come back ! ! MRS . LOPP . Oh ! pleased to have met you -- Good-by ! They start off Left . JINNY . No , not that way -- back the way you came . MRS . LOPP . Oh , thank you ! She drops her black silk bag ; out of it drop crackers , an account book , a thimble , a thread-and-needle case , a bottle of pepsin tablets , etc . They all stoop to pick the collection up , JINNY helping . JINNY . Handing . I 'm sure you 'll want these ! MRS . LOPP . Yes , indeed ; do n't you find them coupon meals very dissatisfactory ? CARRIE . Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MRS . LOPP and CARRIE go out Left . JINNY looks at her watch and goes back to her letter . MRS . CULLINGHAM enters Left . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Screams . Jinny ! JINNY . Jumps up . Mrs. Cullingham ! They embrace . Did Jack find you ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . No , we have n't seen him ! Ruth and Peter are dawdling along , each on their own ; I like to shoot through a gallery . There 's no use spending so much time ; when it 's over you 've mixed everything all up just the same ! JINNY . Laughing . Well , I 've this minute read a letter from Geoffrey saying you were over here . And Jack , who thought he got a glimpse of you a little while ago , went straight off to try and find you . MRS . CULLINGHAM . What fun it is to see you -- and how happy you look ! JINNY . I could n't look as happy as I feel ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Glancing at the statue . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Laughing . JINNY . Mr. Apollo ! Would you like to meet him ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . Hesitates . Er -- no -- I do n't think ! You must draw the line somewhere ! He would n't do a thing to Corbett , would he ? JINNY . Who was Corbett ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . He was a prize fighter , and is -- but that 's another story --  Do you mean to say you 've never heard of him ? JINNY . Oh , the name sounds familiar . But this , you know , is Apollo . MRS . CULLINGHAM . No , I do n't know ; was he a champion ? JINNY . No , he was a Greek god ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Oh , was he ? Well , I would n't have cared about being in the tailoring business in those days , would you ? Let 's sit down . They sit on bench Right . Of course you know we would n't accept a thing like that in Peoria , where I come from , as a gift ! No , indeed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor , he 'd return it C.O.D . JINNY . Sounds like Boston and the Macmonnies Bacchante ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Oh , my dear , worse than that ! It reminds me of a man at home who kept an underclothing store in our principal street and had a plaster cast of this gent 's brother , I should think , in his window to show a suit of Jaegers on , you know , a " combination " ! And our Town Committee of Thirteen for the moral improvement of Peoria made the man take it out of his window and hang the suit up empty ! JINNY . Poor man ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . You ought to see our Park ! you know we 've got a perfectly beautiful park ,  - -  and all the men statues wear Prince Alberts , and stand like this --  She poses with lifted arm at right angle to body.  - -  as if they were saying , " This way out " or " To the monkey cage and zoo . " JINNY . Laughing . But the women statues ? MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands ; all the rest 's just clumps of drapery -- we only have " Americans " and " Libertys , " anyway . They apply the Chinese emigration law to all Venuses and sich ladies ! They both laugh . JINNY . Where did you say Peter and Ruth were ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . Well , I left Peter -- who is n't at all well ; I hoped this trip would help his indigestion , but it seems to have made it worse !  - -  I left him -- er -- in a room with a lot of broken-up Venuses -- I thought it was all right ; he was eating candy , and there was n't a whole woman among ' em ! JINNY . Slight strain in her voice . How did you happen to bring over Ruth Chester ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . Well , you know I always liked her . She never snubbed me in her life -- I do n't think any one you 've introduced me to has been quite so nice to Peter and me as Mrs. Chester and her daughter . JINNY . O they are real people ! MRS . CULLINGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin as a rail and the family are worried . She says there 's nothing worrying her , and the doctors ca n't find anything the matter with her ,  - -  so Mrs. Chester asked me if I would n't take her abroad . They thought the voyage and change might do her good , and I seem to have a more cheery influence over her than most people . So here we are ! As PETER enters Left , eating . Here 's Peter ! How do you think the darling looks ? PETER . How do you do , Mrs. Austin ? JINNY . How do you do , Peter ? They shake hands . I 'm sorry to hear you are seedy , but you eat too many sweet things . PETER . I 'm not eating candy ; it 's soda mints ! Showing a small bottle . I am bad to-day , mother . MRS . CULLINGHAM . If you do n't get better , we 'll go to Carlsbad . JINNY . How do you like Rome , Peter ? PETER . Oh , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a real lively town . JINNY . Laughing . I think I 'll go look for Jack and tell him you 've turned up . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Perhaps he 's found Ruth . JINNY . With a change in her voice . Yes , perhaps . She goes out Right . PETER . Going to the doorway Right , calls after her . Ruth 's in a room on your left , with rows of men 's heads on shelves , Emperors and things ,  - -  but gee , such a job lot ! Comes back and looks up at the statue . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Is n't it beautiful , Peter ? PETER . No , it 's too big ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Still this one is n't broken ! PETER . That 's a comfort ! Yes , it has been mended , too ! Examining . Oh , yes , it 's only another of these second-hand statues . Say , you missed one whole one , the best I 've seen yet ! A Venus off in a fine little room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Why , Peter Cullingham ! Alone ? What kind of a Venus ? PETER . Oh , beautiful ! I forgot to take my medicine ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Was she -- er -- dressed , darling ? PETER . We -- you know -- she had been , but she 'd sort of pushed it a good way off ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . With a sigh . You know we ought to admire these things , Peter darling ; that 's partly what we 've come to Europe for ! PETER . O pshaw ! here comes a gang of tourists . Come on , let 's skip ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . But Ruth and Mrs. Austin ? PETER . We did n't agree to wait , and we can all meet at our hotel . A crowd of TOURISTS , led by a GUIDE , presses and crowds in the doorway . They drag their tired feet in a listless shuffle across the room and stand in a somewhat sheepish and stupid bunch at the statue . One or two of the younger women nudge each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . The GUIDE describes the statue , and while he is doing so PETER and MRS . CULLINGHAM go out Right . Most of the TOURISTS turn and watch them go instead of looking at the statue . GUIDE . This is the Apollo Belvedere , discovered at the end of the fifteenth century , some say in a Roman villa or farm-house near the Grotter Terratter . Very fine specimen both as marble and man . This statyer is calculated to make Sandow et cetery look like thirty cents . Height seven feet , weight --  A MAN TOURIST . How much ? A GIRL TOURIST . Was he married ? Titters from the group . GUIDE . Give it up ! Should judge he was . The god once held a bow in his left hand and probably a laurel wreath in his right . ANOTHER WOMAN TOURIST . A what ? GUIDE . A laurel wreath . You want to take a good look at this , as it is a very fine piece . Now come along , please -- make haste ; we must finish up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the TOURISTS follow , shuffling along , without speaking , MRS . LOPP and CARRIE lagging in the rear . AUSTIN enters Left , followed by RUTH . AUSTIN . This is where I left her with Apollo ! Calls . Jinny ! She seems to have gone ! He looks behind the statue and out door , Right . RUTH . Probably the Cullinghams , who were headed in this direction , found her , and they 've all gone back for us ; you see I walked all around the court first without going into the rooms , so I missed them , but found you . AUSTIN . What shall we do ? Sit down here and wait for them to come back , or shall I go in search ? RUTH . Oh , no , you might miss them , and then we 'd all be lost ! If you left Jinny here , she 's sure to come back to meet you . She sits on the bench and AUSTIN stands behind her . AUSTIN . I 'm sorry to learn you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AUSTIN . Ah , I 'm afraid it 's a good deal . Will you forgive me if I say I think I know what it is ! She looks up startled . After a moment . You have n't forgotten the day of Jinny 's and my wedding , when you told me Geoffrey Tillman needed a friend ? RUTH . I hoped you 'd forgotten ; I ought n't to have told you ; I ought n't to have ! AUSTIN . Why not ? I had a talk with Geoffrey , then , and he told me everything . RUTH . He did ! You are sure ? AUSTIN . Sure . He sits beside her . RUTH . That he and I --  AUSTIN . Love each other . RUTH . Oh , but that is n't all . AUSTIN . I know the rest ! RUTH . He told you -- about -- about --  AUSTIN . The marriage ?  - -  Yes ? RUTH . Oh , I 'm so glad , so glad ! Now I can speak of it to some one , and some one who can advise me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already advised him , but he does n't seem to be taking my advice ; it has worried me . RUTH . When I left he was awfully depressed . He said he saw no prospect of being able to publish our marriage for years , maybe ! AUSTIN . What marriage ? In astonishment . RUTH . Our marriage , in Brooklyn ! She notices his expression and is alarmed . You said he had told you ! AUSTIN . Recovering himself , and speaking at first with hesitation . Yes , but not the details , not -- wait , I 'm a little confused . Rising and walking a moment . Let 's get it all quite clear now , that 's the only way I can help you -- both ; I ought , of course , to have gone through it all with him , but there really was n't time . RUTH . I ca n't go on like this much longer . It 's killing me to deceive mother ; I must tell her soon ! AUSTIN . Quickly , stops walking . No . You must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ; you 'll obey me , wo n't you ? RUTH . Yes , if you only will help us ! AUSTIN . You said you and Geoffrey Tillman were married where ? RUTH . In Brooklyn . AUSTIN . When ? RUTH . A month before your wedding . AUSTIN . To himself . It 's impossible ! Walking up and down . RUTH . Smiling sadly . Oh , no ! I remember the date only too well . AUSTIN . I did n't mean that . RUTH . I lied to my mother that day for the first time -- at any rate , since I was a child -- and I 've been lying to her ever since . AUSTIN . Probing her . But -- but why were you married so secretly ? RUTH . We could n't afford to marry and set up for ourselves . He expected then to be sent off at once to the Philippines , and -- well he did n't want to leave me behind , free ; I 'm afraid he 's rather jealous -- you must have found out by now that Jinny is . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far off without my belonging to him either ; I 'm that jealous , too ! Smiling . So -- that 's why ! AUSTIN . And this long period of secrecy since then -- do you understand that ? Ruth . Has n't he explained to you his debts ? You know before he loved me he was very fast , but since --  AUSTIN . Yes , I know how he gave up every one of his old habits with a great deal of courage . RUTH . Nobody knows what it cost him ! How can you help us ? Get him something to do to pay off his debts ? Or ca n't you make him feel even if we do have to go on living at our different homes for a while , it is better to publish the fact that we are married ?  --  AUSTIN . I shall go back at once to America if I can persuade Jinny ! RUTH . And I , too ? AUSTIN . No . You must stay abroad till I send word for you to come home . If I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing exactly as I say , wo n't you ? RUTH . Yes . AUSTIN . It 's very important that you should absolutely obey me ! RUTH . I will . A pause . JINNY , unnoticed by either of them , appears in the doorway at Right . AUSTIN is walking up and down . RUTH is leaning her elbow on the back of the bench and burying her face in her hands . AUSTIN . It 's awful ! My God , it 's awful ! JINNY . In a strained , assumed , nonchalant tone . What is ? RUTH . Jinny ! Rising . AUSTIN . I did n't hear you , Jinny ! JINNY . No , you both seemed so absorbed . RUTH . Going to JINNY . I 'm so glad to see you . Kisses her , but JINNY only gives her her cheek and that rather unwillingly ; she is looking all the time at her husband . JINNY . Thank you , I 've just left the Cullinghams . They sent word to you they were going and would wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must n't keep them waiting . We 'll all meet at dinner to-night , wo n't we ? Good-by -- good-by . With a grateful look at AUSTIN , she goes out Right . JINNY . Watches her go ; then turns to AUSTIN . That was n't true , what I told her -- I have n't seen the Cullinghams , and I do n't know where they are , and what 's more , I do n't care ! AUSTIN . What do you mean ? JINNY . Beginning by degrees to lose control of herself . What did she mean by following you to Rome ? AUSTIN . Jinny ! JINNY . Oh , do n't try to deny it ; that 'll only make me suspect you ! AUSTIN . My dear girl , you do n't know what you 're saying ! JINNY . She 's ill , they say at home ! Yes , and they do n't know what 's the matter with her , do they ? No ! But I can tell them ! She 's in love with another woman 's husband ! AUSTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to say such things ! JINNY . With a disagreeable little laugh . Oh , wo n't you ? You 'd better be careful ,  - -  my eyes are opened ! AUSTIN . Yes , and much too wide . JINNY . A half-blind person would have known there was something between you two . When I came into this room just now , it was in the air -- it was in both your faces ! She sits on the bench . AUSTIN . You 've worked yourself up to such a pitch you 're not responsible for what you 're saying ! JINNY . I not responsible ! What was it you were saying was so " awful " when I came in here ? " My God , so awful ! " He does n't answer . Almost hysterical , she rises . She had told you she loved you ! She 'd confessed she 'd followed you over here ! AUSTIN . Absolutely false , both your suppositions ! JINNY . Oh , of course you 'd protect her ; you 're a gentleman ! But if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Jinny ! How can you have such a thought ? JINNY . Well , why did n't you tell me when you thought you saw her a little while ago ? AUSTIN . Oh --  JINNY . Oh , it 's very easy to say " Oh ! " Imitating him. but why did n't you ? AUSTIN . I told you I did n't think who it was ; I only thought something familiar flashed across my eyes . Jinny darling , this is sheer madness on your part , letting yourself go like this . It has no reason , it has no excuse ! Ask your own heart , and your own mind , if in speaking to me as you have , you have n't done me at least an injustice and my love for you a little wrong . JINNY . Well , I 'm sure she 's in love with you , anyway . AUSTIN . No , she is n't ! And it 's disgraceful of you to say so ! I know she isn't --  JINNY . How do you know she is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure of it ! You must n't think , dear , that because you love me , everybody does -- you idealize me ! Smiling apologetically . JINNY . Oh , you 're so modest you do n't see ! but I do -- on the steamer , in the hotels , everywhere we go , always , all the women admire you awfully ! I see it ! AUSTIN . Laughing . What utter nonsense ! Taking her into his arms . You 've got something in your eyes ! JINNY . Only tears ! AUSTIN . No , something else , something green . JINNY . Laughs through her tears . Somebody 's told you my old nickname ! AUSTIN . What ? JINNY . Laughs and is a little embarrassed . The girl with the green eyes . AUSTIN . Ahem !  --  JINNY . Well , I do n't care if it is appropriate , I ca n't help it . Slipping from his arms . AUSTIN . You must -- or it will threaten our happiness if you let yourself be carried away by jealousy for no earthly reason outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time --  Interrupted . JINNY . You honestly do n't think she cares for you ? AUSTIN . Not a bit ! JINNY . But what was it you were so serious about -- what is between you ? AUSTIN . She is in a little trouble , and I happen to know about it . JINNY . How ? AUSTIN . After a second 's hesitation . That you must n't ask me ; it was not from her I knew of it . JINNY . Truly ? AUSTIN . Truly . JINNY . I do n't care , she had n't any business to go to you ! I should think she 'd have gone to a woman instead of a man for sympathy . She 's got Mrs. Cullingham ! AUSTIN . She ca n't go to her , poor girl . Mrs. Cullingham knows nothing about it . JINNY . Now do n't you get too sympathetic -- that 's very dangerous ! AUSTIN . Look out , your imagination is peeping through the keyhole . A moment 's pause . JINNY . In a sympathetic tone , the jealousy gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , dear , I ca n't tell you now ; some day , perhaps , if you want me to , but not now . Only I give you my word of honor , it has nothing to do with you and me -- does not touch our life ! And I want you to tell me you believe me , and trust me , and wo n't let yourself be jealous again ! JINNY . I do believe you , and I do trust you , and I will try not to be jealous again ! AUSTIN . That 's right . JINNY . You know that book of De Maupassant 's They move away together . I was reading in the train the other day ,  - -  about the young girl who killed herself with charcoal fumes when her lover deserted her ? AUSTIN . Half laughing . This is apropos of what , please ? I have absolutely no sympathy with such people . JINNY . In America that girl would have simply turned on the gas . AUSTIN . You 're getting morbid , Jinny ! JINNY . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interrupting -- laughing it off . I shall install electric light as soon as we get home ! They both laugh . JINNY . I 'm sorry I was so disagreeable to Ruth , but I 'll try to make up for it in every way I can . She sits on the bench and he leans over the back toward her . AUSTIN . There 's one other thing , Jinny , I 'd like to speak of now . Would you mind giving up the Lakes and going home this week ? JINNY . Going home -- at once ? AUSTIN . Yes -- Wall Street is very uncertain . I 'm worried ,  - -  I do n't mind telling you ,  - -  and I want to see Geoffrey about his business . JINNY . Half in earnest . Jack ! You 're not running away from her , are you ? AUSTIN . Jinny ! After all we 've said ! JINNY . No ! I was n't in earnest ! I 'm ready to go . I 've seen the Lakes , and whether you are in Italy or in New York , so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . AUSTIN . And may it last all our lives ! JINNY . Still , I do n't mind owning up that leaving Ruth Chester behind here is rather pleasanter ! She rises quickly with a sudden thought . She is not going back , too ? AUSTIN . Oh , no , not for a long time . They are over here indefinitely . JINNY . I 've been too horrid and nasty for words this morning , Jack -- I 'm so sorry . AUSTIN . It 's over and forgotten now . JINNY . You do forgive me ? AUSTIN . Of course , dear ; only I want to say this one thing to you : to suspect unjustly a true love is to insult that love ! JINNY . I did n't really suspect you . AUSTIN . Of course I know you did n't ; this is only by way of a grandfatherly warning ! It is possible to insult a true love too often -- and love can die --  JINNY . Sh ! do n't , please , say any more . You have forgiven me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then kiss me ! AUSTIN . Smiling . Here ! My dear , some one will see us ! JINNY . No , only Apollo ; see , there 's no one else about -- it 's luncheon hour ! AUSTIN . But --  Taking her hand . JINNY . Pulling him . Come along , then , behind the statue . No one will see us there ! They are behind the statue a moment and then come around the other side . JINNY . There ! no one saw us , and I 'm so happy , are you ? AUSTIN . " So happy ! " JINNY takes his arm and they go to the Left entrance . She stops and looks up at him . JINNY . Are my eyes green now ? AUSTIN . Now they 're blue ! JINNY . Hurrah ! and I 'm going , from now on , to be so good , you wo n't know me . And hugging his arm tight they go out as --  THE CURTAIN FALLS ACT III ( Three weeks later ) The Austins ' library ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls hung in crimson brocade ; Dutch marqueterie furniture ; blue and white china on the mantel and tops of the book shelves ; carbon photographs of pictures by Reynolds , Ronney , and Gainsborough on the wall . There is a double window at the back . A door at Right leads to the hall , and another on the Left side of the room leads to JINNY 's own room . MRS . TILLMAN sits at a pianola Right , playing " Tell me , Pretty Maiden " ; she stops once in a while , showing that she is unaccustomed to the instrument . JINNY enters from Left , singing as her mother plays . JINNY . Darling mother ! She puts her arms about her and kisses her . They come away from the pianola together , to a big arm-chair . MRS . TILLMAN . I really must get one of those sewing-machine pianos for your father . I believe even he could play it , and it would be lots of amusement for us . JINNY . Jack adores it ; I gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What anniversary ? Sitting in the chair . JINNY . Day before yesterday . The eleventh Tuesday since our marriage . Have you been in town all day ? I am glad to see you ! She sits on the arm of the chair with her arm about her mother . MRS . TILLMAN . Yes , and I told your father to meet me here and we 'd take the six-thirty train from Long Island City . JINNY . Jack and I are going to the theatre to-night . MRS . TILLMAN . I thought they were all closed ! JINNY . Oh , no , there are several musical comedies on ,  - -  Jack 's favorite form of amusement ,  - -  and I 've bought the tickets myself for a sort of birthday party . MRS . TILLMAN . Is it his birthday ? JINNY . No , that 's only my excuse ! MRS . TILLMAN . Laughing . Had we dreamed you and Jack were coming home in June , your father and I would n't have gone into the country so early . JINNY . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . MRS . TILLMAN . And you 're still ideally happy are n't you , darling ? JINNY . Yes --  She rises and goes to a table near the centre of the room and looks at the titles of several books without realizing what they are . MRS . TILLMAN . Why , Jinny ,  - -  what does that mean ? JINNY . Oh , it 's all my horrid disposition ! MRS . TILLMAN . Been seeing green ? JINNY . Um ! Um ! Once in Rome , and on the steamer , and again since we 've been back . MRS . TILLMAN . Nothing serious ? JINNY . Hesitatingly , she turns and faces her mother . No -- but the last time Jack was harder to bring around than before , and he looked at me for fully five minutes without a particle of love in his eyes , and they were almost -- dead eyes ! MRS . TILLMAN . What was it all about ? JINNY . Ruth Chester , principally . MRS . TILLMAN . Why Ruth ? JINNY . Well , the first real scene I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous of her ; I ca n't explain it all to you -- as a matter of fact , it has n't been all explained to me ! Something was troubling Ruth that Jack knew , and he said he 'd help her . MRS . TILLMAN . What ? JINNY . That 's just it ; Jack wo n't tell me . And the day we sailed from Naples a telegram came , and of course I opened it , and it said , " Trust me , I will do everything you say . Ruth . " MRS . TILLMAN . Why have n't you told me anything of all this before , dear ? JINNY . Going back to her mother . I was ashamed to ! Somehow , in the end I always knew I was wrong and had hurt him -- hurt him terribly , mother , the man I love better than everything else in the world ! Yes , even better than you and father and Geoffrey -- all together ! In her mother 's arms , crying a little . MRS . TILLMAN . Oh , this curse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would help you to overcome it . JINNY . He does try hard , I can see sometimes ; but he has n't a spark of it in him , and he ca n't understand it , and I know I 'm unreasonable , and before I know it I am saying things I do n't know what , and some day he wo n't forgive them ! I 'm sure some day he wo n't !  --  Breaking down again . She rises and turns away . MRS . TILLMAN . Rising and putting her arms about her . Come , dear ! Now you 're getting yourself all unstrung , and that wo n't do you any good ; you 've got to fight this battle out , I 'm afraid , by yourself , trusting in the deep love of your husband to teach him forbearance . Your father 's and my troubles were never very big because we shared the curse , so we knew how to sympathize with each other ! JINNY . What an awful thing it is ! MRS . TILLMAN . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it only destroys what is always most precious to you . Jinny , do n't let it destroy your best happiness ! JINNY . Mother , if it should , I 'd kill myself ! MRS . TILLMAN . Shocked , but quite disbelieving her . My dear ! MAGGIE enters Right . MAGGIE . Mr. Tillman is downstairs , madam . MRS . TILLMAN . Tell him to come up . MAGGIE . Yes , madam . She goes out Right . JINNY . Do n't tell father anything before me . MRS . TILLMAN . I do n't know that I shall tell him at all ; he would only advise more cigars ! TILLMAN enters Right . MRS . TILLMAN sits on the sofa at Left . TILLMAN . Are you here ? JINNY . Going to meet him . We are , father dear , and your presence almost completes us . Kisses him . I say almost , because Jack has n't come up town yet , and Geoffrey 's heartless enough to stay on fishing at Cape Cod ! TILLMAN . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits in the arm-chair at Right . JINNY . Oh , I do want to see him ! Sitting near her father . TILLMAN . He ought to have been in by now -- I met them this morning . He was to lunch with Jack , and he 's going to put up for a few days at the University . JINNY . He must dine with us every night . TILLMAN . Jinny !  --  Looking at her.  - -  You look as if you 've been crying ! The two WOMEN are embarrassed , and JINNY does n't reply . TILLMAN . Hurt . Oh , if you prefer to have secrets from your father , it 's all right ! I do n't begrudge your mother her first place in your affections ! JINNY . Not at all , father ; with you and mother there 's no first place . She will tell you all about it on the way home ! Please , mother . MRS . TILLMAN . Very well , dear . TILLMAN . A little " scrap " between you and Jack ? JINNY . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  Thinks a second , then taking out his cigar case , he empties it of cigars and hands them to JINNY . Give your husband these , please , when he comes in ! JINNY and her MOTHER exchange a smile . JINNY . But , father compliments ! JINNY . Laughing . Very well ! TILLMAN . How are you and Maggie getting on ? JINNY . Splendidly . MRS . TILLMAN . Such a nice girl ! JINNY . And was n't it odd Jack was bitterly opposed to my taking her ? MRS . TILLMAN . My dear , if we had n't lent her to you for these few weeks , you would n't have got anybody decent for so short a time . TILLMAN . Why did n't Jack want her to come ? JINNY . I do n't know , he just did n't want her ; and then last week he talked with her in the library for three-quarters of an hour by my watch . MRS . TILLMAN . Why ? JINNY . Oh , it seems she has troubles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what class , seem to make a bee line for my husband , even if they have to cross the ocean ! TILLMAN . What do you mean ? JINNY . Half laughing . Oh , nothing , but it was about that talk with Maggie that we had our last quarrel . MAGGIE enters Right . MAGGIE . Mrs. Cullingham . A second 's dead silence , the announcement falling like a bombshell . JINNY . Astounded . Who ? She rises . TILLMAN AND MRS . TILLMAN . Who ? MAGGIE . Mrs. Cullingham and her son , madam . JINNY . They 're in Europe . MRS . TILLMAN . Are you sure you 're not mistaken , Maggie ? MAGGIE . Oh , yes 'm . Even if you could mistake Mrs. Cullingham , you could n't mistake Mr. Peter ! JINNY . Ask them to please come up , Maggie . MAGGIE . Yes 'm . She goes out Right . TILLMAN . Why , they only just sailed the other day , did n't they ? MRS . TILLMAN . Yes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Ruth Chester 's health ! What in the world can they have come back for ? JINNY . With curious determination . That is what I intend to find out . TILLMAN . Rising . We must be going , Susan ; we 've lost our train as it is . MRS . TILLMAN . Rising . We can take the seven-two . MAGGIE shows in MRS . CULLINGHAM and PETER . PETER shakes hands with MRS . TILLMAN , then with JINNY , and then with MR . TILLMAN . MRS . CULLINGHAM kisses MRS . TILLMAN and shakes hands with MR . TILLMAN . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Jinny , you angel , are n't you surprised ! Kissing her . JINNY . Well , rather ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Well , you are n't a bit more surprised than I am . A clock strikes six-thirty . There goes the half hour , Peter ; you must take your powder . PETER . I beg your pardon , mother ; it 's the tablet now . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Excuse me , dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JINNY . To Peter . Will you have some water ? PETER . No , thank you , I 've learned now to take them au naturel , and without much , if any , inconvenience ! Takes his tablet with still a certain amount of difficulty , and sits Right . MRS . TILLMAN . To MRS . CULLINGHAM . Did you have a bad voyage ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . No , perfectly beautiful ! PETER . Reproachfully , and with a final swallow . Oh , mother ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Except , of course , for poor Peter ; he gets worse every trip ! He can eat absolutely nothing -- that is for long ! But it 's the Custom House that 's worn me out ; I was there from twelve till four . MRS . TILLMAN . But you would n't have had time to buy anything ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Of course not ! But I took plenty of new dresses for the entire summer ; most of them had n't been worn , and they were determined to make me pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ! I wanted to try and smuggle , but Jack would n't let me ! MR . TILLMAN . I 'm afraid we must go ! ALL rise . MRS . CULLINGHAM . What do you think the Inspector had the impudence to ask me finally , if I wanted to bring the dresses in as theatrical properties ! They laugh . MRS . TILLMAN . You must have some gorgeous frocks ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Oh , there are some paillettes ! But who do you suppose he took me for -- Sarah Bernhardt ! TILLMAN . Looking at his watch . I do n't wish to interrupt this vital political conversation , but , Susan , if you do n't want to miss the seven-two train , too --  ! MRS . TILLMAN . Rising . Oh , no , we must n't do that . Good-by . To MRS . CULLINGHAM , shaking hands . It 's nice to see you again , anyway . Is Ruth better ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . I 'm sorry to say -- I do n't think she is -- good-by . To MR . TILLMAN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JINNY . You want me to tell your father ? JINNY . Yes , it 's better ; it does make him jealous if he thinks I tell you things and keep secrets from him . TILLMAN . Good-by , Peter . MRS . TILLMAN . Good-by , Peter . PETER . By-by . MR. and MRS . TILLMAN quickly go out Right , JINNY going to the door with them . JINNY . Coming back from doorway . Now do tell me what it means . I thought you were abroad indefinitely , or for the summer at least . MRS . CULLINGHAM . So did I ! I 'm just as surprised to be here as you seem to be ! They sit down near each other . Did n't you really know we were coming ? JINNY . No ! How should I ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . I do n't know -- I thought --  She hesitates , embarrassed . After a pause . JINNY . What did you think ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . Nothing , except that you must know we were coming home . JINNY . Why -- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put me into a corner like that ! JINNY . How do you mean " corner " ? How did you happen to come home like this ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . Ruth suddenly got a cable -- she did n't tell me from whom -- but she said she must go home at once . JINNY . But her mother 's never been better ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Carelessly . The cable was n't from her mother . JINNY . Oh , then , you know who it was from ? No answer . Oh , I see now why you thought I ought to know about it ; the cable was from Jack , was n't it ? MRS . CULLINGHAM . Relieved . Yes . JINNY . Oh , it was ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . I looked at it when she was out of the room ; of course , it was sort of by accident --  Very much embarrassed.  - -  that is , I just happened to see -- O dear , there ! You know what I mean ; it was dreadful of me , but I could n't help it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very good friends and he looks after some of her affairs . You know having no man in the family complicates things . PETER . Oh ! I say ! Standing up , suddenly . MRS . CULLINGHAM . What is it , dear ? PETER . I believe I have n't got my before-dinner tabs . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Oh , look carefully ! PETER . He looks in his right-hand pocket , takes out a bottle . Soda mints ! From his left-hand pocket a box . Alkali powders ! From third pocket a bottle . Charcoal tablets ! From fourth pocket another bottle . Dr. Man 's Positive Cure ! From fifth pocket a box . Bicarbonate soda ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . There 's your other side pocket ! PETER . That 's my saccharine Showing bottle. and my lithia tabs . Showing another bottle . We 'll have to go , mother ; I 've left them home ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . We must go , anyway , my dear . Rising . JINNY also rises . PETER . Suddenly claps his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go after all ; I forgot my hip pocket . Here they are ! Bringing them out . MRS . CULLINGHAM . We must go all the same ! To JINNY . Sometimes I think he takes too much medicine stuff ! JINNY . I should think so ! Peter , you ought to diet . PETER . I ca n't ! I 've tried , and I lose my appetite right away ! MRS . CULLINGHAM . Good-by , dear . How long will you be in town ? JINNY . I do n't know -- several weeks , I imagine . Jack came home on some business , you know , and I do n't think it 's settled yet . Good-by . To PETER . PETER . Good-by . You know you must n't drink water with your meals ; that 's the great thing . So I drink only champagne . He goes out Right . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Waits and speaks to JINNY with real feeling . I 'm awfully ashamed of myself , and I hope I have n't made any trouble or fuss with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , of course not . With a strained smile . MRS . CULLINGHAM . I wish I could believe you . JINNY . Well , do . MRS . CULLINGHAM . Good-by . She goes out Right . JINNY . Good-by . Where 's that telegram that came for him a little while ago ? Going to the desk at Right , and finding the telegram . Of course it 's from her , saying that she 's arrived . That 's the trouble with telegrams ; the address does n't give the handwriting away . She must have sent it from the dock ! Could n't even wait till she was home ! She walks to the window and stands there a moment , then comes back , looking at her watch . Nearly seven already , and no sign of him , and we must dress and dine -- huh ! I think I might as well tear up my theatre tickets ! She paces up and down the room , stopping now and then with each new thought that comes to her . I wonder if he went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he cabled her to come back , she must have cabled an answer and what boat she 'd take ! But no other telegram has come for Jack here to my knowledge -- oh ! of course , what am I thinking of , she sent that one to his office to-day ; she was afraid he might have left before this one could get there , so she risked it here . Good Heavens ! why am I maudling on like this to myself out loud ? It 's really nothing -- Jack will explain once more that he ca n't explain , but that Ruth has " troubles , " and I 'll believe him again ! But I wo n't ! He promised me she should stay over there ! Looks at her watch again . He 's there , with her ! Nothing ever kept him half as late down town as this ! What a little fool I am ! GEOFFREY enters suddenly Right . JINNY . Cries out , joyfully . Geoffrey ! And rushing to him , embraces him . You brute , you , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was home ! You dear old darling , you ! GEOFFREY . I could n't , old girl ; there were reasons -- I do n't have to tell you I wanted to . JINNY . I do n't know ! Was there a pretty girl up there , Geof ? I 'm sure I should n't think her pretty if you were in love with her . I believe I shall be awfully jealous of your wife when you get one ! GEOFFREY . Rubbish ! Has n't Jack come back yet ? JINNY . " Come back " from where ? GEOFFREY . Brooklyn . JINNY . Brooklyn ! Why , he told me -- what did he go there for ? GEOFFREY . Embarrassed . I do n't know if you don't --  JINNY . You do ! ! GEOFFREY . No -- really -- I --  JINNY . Oh , it 's something to be concealed , then ? GEOFFREY . Hang it , Jinny ! drop the subject . I thought he said he was going to Brooklyn ; probably I was mistaken . JINNY . Satirically . One is so apt to think just casually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her watch . Of course it 's Brooklyn . Goes and looks at the telegram ; turns . So you 're going back on me , too , are you ? You 're going to protect Jack at my expense ! AUSTIN enters Right . AUSTIN . Absorbed . Good evening , Jinny dear . JINNY . It 's after seven ! AUSTIN . Pleasantly . Is it ? Have you been waiting long , Geoffrey ? GEOFFREY . No , I 've only just now come in . JINNY . It 's I who have done the waiting ! AUSTIN . I 'm sorry , but it could n't be helped . JINNY . You did n't tell me you were going to Brooklyn . AUSTIN . After a quick , sharp look at Geoffrey , who shakes his head once emphatically . It must have escaped my mind . JINNY . That 's very likely ! Going to Brooklyn 's the sort of thing one talks about and dreads for days . AUSTIN . Well , Jinny , that will bear postponement , and my conversation with Geoffrey wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while ? JINNY . And what about the theatre ? AUSTIN . What theatre ? JINNY . Oh , you 've forgotten entirely my little birthday party ! Thanks ! AUSTIN . Oh , Jinny ! I did ! Forgive me ! I 'm awfully sorry ! I 've got a lot on my mind to-day . Tries to put his arms about her and kiss her . She pushes herself away from him , refusing to let him kiss her . JINNY . Yes -- I know you have --  At door Left.  - -  I 'll leave you two to your confidences . You can trust Geof ; he just now refused to betray you . AUSTIN only looks at her fixedly , seriously . She looks back at him with bravado . Then she deliberately crosses the room , gets the cable , and recrosses with it and goes out Left . AUSTIN . Poor Jinny ! Turning to GEOFFREY. and that , too , lies largely on your already overcrowded shoulders . GEOFFREY . Breaking down . I know ! I know ! AUSTIN . Sitting in the corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be strong now , and you 've no use nor time for crying . I 've had another long interview with the Brooklyn minister . GEOFFREY . Yes ?  --  AUSTIN . Drawing a chair near to him and sitting . Well , of course we both know that he 's doing wrong to keep silent , but he will . He wishes I had n't told him , because he thinks he 'd never have noticed your divorce from Maggie when it was granted -- nor remembered your name if he had seen it in the papers . GEOFFREY . That 's what I told you ! AUSTIN . You only argued that for fear I 'd insist on your going to this minister yourself . But in the bottom of your heart you know it was a risk we could n't afford to run . I 've explained everything to him -- how such a fine , sweet girl would suffer if he did expose you , and I gave him my word you would be remarried to Ruth at once after the divorce . Of course we both know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means that removes difficulty number two . GEOFFREY . You 're sure about Maggie ? AUSTIN . She 's signed a paper ; she realizes you 'll never live with her , and -- it 's pathetic -- she loves you -- that girl , too -- so much as to give you your freedom -- Good Lord ! what is it about you weak men that wins women so ? What is it in you that has made two women love you to such a self-sacrificing extent ? GEOFFREY . Half tragic , half comic laugh . I give it up ! AUSTIN . Bitterly . So do I. Well , Maggie is to have six hundred dollars a year . GEOFFREY . Where 'll I get it ? AUSTIN . We 'll talk about that when the time comes . He rises . Now the most important , the most painful , task of all must be done and you must do it . Not I this time -- you ! GEOFFREY . Looking up , frightened . What ? AUSTIN . Ruth Chester landed this morning . GEOFFREY . Starting up . Impossible ! Rising . AUSTIN . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . You ca n't go out west and institute proceedings for divorce without her knowing the whole truth from you first ! You do n't want her to find it out from the newspapers , do you ? GEOFFREY . And you want me to tell her ? AUSTIN . To-day . And to-morrow you start west ! GEOFFREY . Facing AUSTIN . I wo n't tell her ! AUSTIN . Calmly . You 've got to ! Geoffrey . I 'd rather shoot myself ; do you understand me -- I 'd rather shoot myself ! AUSTIN . That 's nothing ! That would be decidedly the easiest course out of it , and the most cowardly . GEOFFREY . She 'll hate me ! She 'll loathe me ! How could she help it at first ! But just after a little , if I were n't there , the love she has for me might move her somehow or other -- and by degrees perhaps -- to forgive --  AUSTIN . I do n't deny that you will have to go through a terrible degradation with her -- but that is nothing compared with what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation is secret , locked there between you two , and no one else in the world can ever know what happens ; but if you send some one else , and no matter who ,  - -  any one else but you is an outsider , you ask her to make a spectacle of her humiliation , to let a third in as witness to the relations and emotions between you two ! It 's insulting her again ! Do n't you see ? A pause . GEOFFREY . Yes , I see ! My God ! I must tell her myself . AUSTIN . That 's right , do n't waver , make up your mind and do it -- Come ! Urging him up . GEOFFREY . Hesitates a moment . And Jinny ? AUSTIN . Oh , she 'll come round all right ; she always does . GEOFFREY . And she does n't suspect ? AUSTIN . Not the slightest . A pause . GEOFFREY . Need she ? AUSTIN . The worst ? No , never ! GEOFFREY . He rises , with new encouragement . You 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . I know how much she loves you ; I would n't have her know anything . It 's made us some ugly scenes , but they soon pass , and when you are once out of your trouble for good , we 'll have no excuse , I 'm sure , for any more ! GEOFFREY . Then I shall go to bed to-night with the respect still of at least two women who are dear to me , my mother and Jinny , even if I lose the respect and love of the one woman who is dearer ! Only think , Jack , how I 've got to stand up there -- never mind about myself -- and make her suffer tortures ! Good-by . God give me courage to do the heart-breaking thing I must do . AUSTIN . I am sure the one hope you have of forgiveness is in your manliness of going to her as you are doing and telling her yourself all the truth ! GEOFFREY . And that , like everything else , I owe to you . AUSTIN . No , to Jinny ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes out Right . AUSTIN . Goes to the door Left , opens it , and calls to JINNY , in the next room . Jinny , Geoffrey 's gone ,  - -  what are you doing ? JINNY . Answers in a very little staccato voice . Waiting till you should have the leisure to receive me ! AUSTIN . Come along ! Leaves the doorway . JINNY enters Left and stands in the doorway . JINNY . With affected nonchalance . I did n't care to go downstairs for dinner , so I have had a tray up here . Maggie brought up something for you , too ; would you like it now ? AUSTIN . Ignoring purposely her mood and manner . I should n't mind ! I do feel a little hungry . He sits in the arm-chair . JINNY . Speaks off through the doorway Left . Bring in the tray for Mr. Austin , Maggie . MAGGIE . Off stage . Yes 'm . JINNY pulls forward a little tea table beside his chair . Her whole manner must be one of slow , dragging carelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be hard . She carries the telegram still unopened , and on top of it the theatre tickets torn into pieces . MAGGIE brings in the tray , puts it on the table , and goes out Right . On the tray are chops , peas , some whiskey , a syphon , a roll , etc . AUSTIN . Sits down quickly and with a show of eagerness . Ah ! Begins to eat as if he were hungry and enjoyed it . JINNY sits on the sofa at his Left , and looks at him ,  - -  AUSTIN is of course conscious of JINNY 'S mood , but pretends not to notice it . AUSTIN . After a silence during which he eats . I say I am hungry ! And these chops are very good , are n't they ? No answer . I 'll tell you what it is , Jinny ! Of course travelling is great sport and all the rest of it , but after all one does get tired of hotels , and to quote a somewhat familiar refrain , " There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a headache , Jinny ? JINNY . Very short . No . AUSTIN . That 's a good thing , and I hope you are not as disappointed as I am about the theatre . JINNY . Half laughs . Humph ! AUSTIN . I 'll celebrate your birthday to-morrow and take you . JINNY . Quickly . Why did you go to Brooklyn ? AUSTIN . On the private business of some one else . JINNY . With all her nerves tied tight . That 's the best answer you will give me ? AUSTIN . My dear girl , it 's the only answer I can give you . JINNY . When you are through I have something for you ! AUSTIN . What ? JINNY . I 'll give it to you when you have finished . AUSTIN . I 'm ready . He rises . JINNY rises too , and gives him the telegram with the torn tickets on top , and then rings the bell , at Right . What are these torn papers ? JINNY . Our theatre tickets ! He looks at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This afternoon . AUSTIN . Why did n't I get it when I came in ? JINNY . Bitingly . I kept it to have the pleasure of giving it to you myself ; it 's from Ruth Chester . AUSTIN . How do you know ? JINNY . Oh , I have n't opened it ! But I know ! When I held it in my hand it burnt my fingers ! MAGGIE enters Right . Take away the tray , please , Maggie . MAGGIE . Yes 'm . She leaves the room with the tray . JINNY replaces the small table carelessly , almost roughly . AUSTIN opens and reads the telegram ; there is a second 's pause . JINNY . May I read it ? AUSTIN . After a moment 's hesitation . Yes , if you wish . Not handing it to her . JINNY . I do ! AUSTIN . Reaches over and hands her the telegram ; he speaks quietly . When you behave like this it 's impossible for me to feel the same toward you . JINNY . And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reads it , satirically , bitterly . " Arrived safely ; please let me see you before the day goes . Ruth . " " Ruth " if you please ! AUSTIN . Standing over JINNY . I want you to be careful to-night . I want you to control yourself . I 've been through a great deal to-day , and if you make me angry God knows what I might n't say and do ! JINNY . And I 've been through a great deal for many a day now , and I want the truth about this at last ! It 's all very well for you to spare her by not telling me what this mysterious trouble is about which you 've been hoodwinking me ever since we were married , but now you 've got to choose between sparing her and sparing me ! She sits determinedly . AUSTIN . Is this your answer to me when I beg you to be very careful to-night to control yourself ? JINNY . It 's your turn to be careful ! What did you marry me for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! JINNY . A little frightened , to excuse herself . You gave me your word of honor she would stay abroad indefinitely . AUSTIN . Nonsense ! I said I understood she was going to stay some time -- indefinitely . JINNY . It 's the same thing , and here she is back practically the moment we are ! AUSTIN . I ca n't control Miss Chester 's movements -- I could n't foresee when she would come back . In Rome she told me she would stay on . JINNY . Rising and facing him . Ah ! that 's what I wanted to see , if you really would lie to me ! AUSTIN . What do you mean ? JINNY . Beside herself . Liar ! He only looks at her , with his face hard and set ; she is insane with jealousy for the moment . You sent for Ruth to come back . AUSTIN . And if I did ? JINNY . You tried to deceive me about it . And if you 'll tell me a lie about one thing , you 'll tell me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of all your explanations about the intrigue between you and Ruth Chester ! AUSTIN . Taking her two hands . Sit down ! She sits in the arm-chair , half forced by him . JINNY . Why did you send for Ruth Chester to come back ? AUSTIN . I have told you before , I am trying to help Miss Chester . JINNY . " Ruth ! " AUSTIN . I am trying to help her in a great and serious trouble . JINNY . Why did you send for her to come back ? What 's the trouble ? AUSTIN . I 've told you before I ca n't tell you . JINNY . You dare n't tell me , and you have n't even the face to tell another lie about it ! AUSTIN . If you say another word , I shall hate you ! If you wo n't control yourself , I must make you , as well as keep my own sane balance . You have insulted my love for you to-night as you 've never done before ; you 've struck at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a word , what I warned you you might do -- kill the love I have for you ! JINNY . Frightened . Jack ! AUSTIN . I mean what I say ! JINNY . In tears . That -- that you -- you do n't love me ? AUSTIN . That is not what I said , but I tell you now that since I first began to care for you , never have I loved you so little as I do to-night . JINNY . With an effort at angry justification . And suppose I tell you it is your own fault , because you have n't treated me --  AUSTIN . Interrupting her . Like a child , instead of a woman ! JINNY . No , because you 've kept part of yourself from me , and that part you 've given --  AUSTIN . For God 's sake , stop ! A pause -- JINNY is now thoroughly frightened ; slowly she comes to her senses . Do you want a rupture for good between us ? No answer . Ca n't you see what I tell you is true ? That I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will rob me of every bit of love I have for you , just as you 've already robbed me of the woman I thought you were ? JINNY . " Already ! " No , no , Jack , do n't say that . Oh , what have I done ! She cries . AUSTIN . You 've done something very serious , and before you do more --  Speaking hardly.  - -  I think we 'd better not stay in this evening ; it would be wiser for both of us if we went out somewhere . JINNY . No , I could n't go out feeling this way ! I 've hurt you , hurt you terribly ! Oh , why do I do it ? Why ca n't I help myself ? AUSTIN . I think one more scene to-night would finish things for us . I warn you of that , Jinny --  He goes to the desk and sits at it , looking blankly before him . She comes slowly , almost timidly , behind his chair . JINNY . No , do n't say it ! do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hate myself , and I 'm so ashamed of myself ! I know I 've disappointed you awfully , awfully ! You did idealize me ; I knew it when you married me , but I told you then I was n't worth your loving me , did n't I ? I never pretended to be worthy of you . I always knew I was n't . AUSTIN . Hush ! JINNY . It 's true ! it 's only too awfully true . But do you remember how you answered me then when I told you I was n't worth your loving me ? AUSTIN . Coldly and without looking at her . No . JINNY . You took me in your arms and held me so I could n't have got away if I 'd wanted to -- which I didn't -- and stopped the words on my lips with your kisses . Her throat fills . He makes no reply . She goes on very pathetically . How I wish you 'd answer me that way now ! AUSTIN . Whose fault is it ? JINNY . Oh , mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it one-half so well as I ! I love you better than anything in the world , love everything of you -- the turn of your head , the blessed touch of your hand , the smallest word that comes from your dear lips -- the thoughts that your forehead hides , but which my heart guesses when I 'm sane ! And yet , try as hard as I can , these mad fits take hold of me , and although I 'd willingly die to save you pain , still I , I myself , hurt and wound you past all bearing ! It does n't make any difference that I suffer too ! I ought to ! I deserve to -- you do n't ! Oh , no ! I know I 'm a disappointment and a failure ! Her eyes fill up with tears and her voice breaks . AUSTIN . He turns to her . No , Jinny , not so bad as that , only I thought you were big -- and you 're so little , oh , so small ! JINNY . Yes , it 's true ; I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be big , too ! I want to be noble and strong , but I 'm not -- I 'm as weak as water -- only it 's boiling water ! I want to be Brunhilde , and I 'm only Frou Frou ! Yes , I 'm little ; but I love you -- I love you ! She sinks on to a stool beside him . A moment 's pause . With a trembling voice . You do n't mind my sitting here ? AUSTIN . No --  Very quietly , he places his arm about her neck , his hand on her shoulder . She quickly steals up her hand to take his , and leaning her head over it , kisses his hand . He draws it away and kisses her hair . JINNY . Timidly , very softly . You forgive me ? AUSTIN . With a long sigh . Yes . JINNY . Bursting into tears and burying her face upon his knees . Thank you -- thank you -- I know I do n't deserve it -- I do n't deserve it -- I do n't deserve it ! AUSTIN . Softly . Sh !  --  JINNY half turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quietly . You forgive me -- but still -- yes , I see it in your face , you do n't love me the same . You look so tired , dear . AUSTIN . Also very quietly . I am , Jinny . JINNY . And -- happy ? AUSTIN . I 'm not quite happy . JINNY . I wish I could make you so -- make you love me the old way . You used to smile a little when you looked at me -- Jack , you do n't any more . But I mean to make you to-night , if I can , and to make you love me as much as ever you did . AUSTIN . Good luck , dear . JINNY . Brightening . What time is it ? AUSTIN . Looking at his watch . Nearly nine . JINNY . I suppose it is too late for me to dress and for us to go to the theatre ? AUSTIN . Oh , yes ,  - -  and I 'm too tired . JINNY . Triumphantly . Well , then , you shall have your theatre at home ! If Mahomet wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lordship ! AUSTIN . I do n't understand ! JINNY . Well , just wait --  She blows her nose.  - -  till I bathe my face and eyes a little ; I feel rather bleary ! Starting to go , she stops and turns . Good-by ? Questioningly . AUSTIN . Quietly . Good-by . JINNY . Who wanted him to call her to him and kiss her . Oh , very well ! but I 'll make you smile yet and kiss me of your own accord to-night -- you 'll see ! She goes out Left . She is heard singing in her room . AUSTIN goes to the desk and after a long sigh he begins to write . AUSTIN . Writing . Dear Ruth . The satisfaction of the visit to Brooklyn prevents me from being disappointed at having missed your telegram till too late to go to your house to-night . My heart aches for the blow you must have this evening , but please God you will bear it bravely . The man who loves you is not bad , but he has been weak . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his present marriage , you will never have cause to complain of him again . And if your future happiness lies truly in his hands , it will be safe there . JINNY . Calls from her room . Are you ready ? AUSTIN . Yes . He stops writing . JINNY . In your orchestra chair ? AUSTIN . Yes . JINNY . What will you have , tragedy or comedy ? AUSTIN . Smiling . Shall we begin with tragedy ? JINNY . All right . AUSTIN . Continues to write . So far I have been able to keep Jinny in absolute ignorance , but I fear the blow must fall upon her soon , and I dread to think of what she , too , will suffer . Help me to keep it from her as long as we can , wo n't you ? JINNY comes back ; she has changed her dress to a loose negligee gown , with a red turban on her head ; she brings two sheets with her . JINNY . Excuse me one minute while I set the stage ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she covers them with the sheets . AUSTIN turns from his letter on the desk , to watch . Uncle Tom 's Cabin , Act Four ! She goes out only for a moment , and reenters , wearing a man 's overcoat , with a pillow tied in the middle with a silk scarf , eyes , nose , and mouth made on it with a burnt match . Eliza crossing the ice ! Come , honey darling ! To the pillow . Mammy 'll save you from de wicked white man ! Jumping up on the sofa , and moving with the springs . You ought to do the bloodhounds for me , Jack ! Excuse me , but you look the part ! AUSTIN watches her , not unamused , but without smiling . Hold tight to Lize , honey , and do n't be afeerd o ' dat big black man over dah -- dat 's Uncle Tom . Crossing to the arm-chair . Do n't be afeerd , honey ; it 's Lize dat 's cuttin ' de ice this time . She throws the pillow away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see this is too serious for you ! She starts singing a cakewalk and dances across the room until she reaches him , where she finishes . AUSTIN . Very good , Jinny ! I 'm sure we could n't have seen better at the theatre . JINNY . Ah ! You 're getting yourself again !  - -  Darling ! Come !  - -  Come !  - -  come to the pianola and you shall have the sextette ! It 's in there ready ; I heard mother struggling with it . You do n't suppose she has designs upon the Casino , do you ? Now -- ready ? He goes to the pianola and starts to play the sextette from " Florodora . " She runs to the opposite side of the room and begins to sing and dance , crossing to AUSTIN as he plays . AUSTIN . After a few moments . But I ca n't see you and play at the same time ; I do n't like it ! JINNY . Delighted . You want to see me , do you ? AUSTIN . Of course I do ! JINNY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! JINNY , hurrying the time of the song , turns it into a regular skirt dance . She dances delightfully and AUSTIN can not resist her charm . His face lightens , he smiles , and love comes into his eyes . JINNY sees and dances and sings all the better till she reaches him . AUSTIN . Rising , he takes her into his arms . You adorable Jinny ! JINNY . Ah , Jack ! You 're smiling again and -- you love me ! Clasping her arms about his neck . AUSTIN . Yes ! Is the theatre finished ? JINNY . No , only the first act . He sits in the big arm-chair , JINNY on his knee . I 'm tired ! He kisses her . There is a pause . There is a knock on the door at Right . Oh , hang it ! Knock repeated . Do n't answer it ! We have n't half made up yet ! AUSTIN . But we must answer it , dear . JINNY . As she rises unwillingly . I do n't see why -- I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in ! MAGGIE enters with a letter . JINNY . What is it , Maggie ? MAGGIE . A note from Miss Chester , m 'm , and she 's downstairs herself waiting for an answer . JINNY . For me ? Taking the letter . MAGGIE . No , m 'm ; I think she said it was for Mr. Austin . JINNY . Oh !  - -  You may wait outside for the answer , Maggie . MAGGIE . Yes , m 'm . She goes out . JINNY . Slowly goes to AUSTIN and gives him the letter , lightly . I see now why you were so anxious to let Maggie in . Perhaps you were expecting this . AUSTIN . Jinny ! Holding her by the hand and trying to pull her over to him . Come , I 'll give you a kiss for the letter . JINNY . No , thank you , I do n't want kisses that are given by you for letters from Ruth Chester . Yes ! do kiss me ! He kisses her . I wo n't be jealous ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not jealous a bit ! Read your old letter ! AUSTIN opens the note and reads it . As he does so JINNY has passed on to the desk and sees AUSTIN 'S unfinished letter to RUTH , which after a little hesitation she picks up and reads . AUSTIN , having read RUTH 'S note , looks up thoughtfully a second , and then re-reads it . JINNY is furious over what she reads . As she finishes she gives a little cry from the very depths of her heart . JINNY . Oh , Jack ! AUSTIN . What is it ? JINNY . Nothing ! She sinks by the desk , crushing the letter in her hand . She looks over at him , and then down at the letter , and then back at him . AUSTIN . Maggie ! JINNY . Rising suddenly . She speaks with a voice trembling with only half-contained emotion and passion . I told her to wait in the hall ; may I read it ? Holding out her hand for the letter . AUSTIN . Now look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't I ? JINNY . Hiding his letter behind her back . Yes . Holding out her other hand . Give it to me ! AUSTIN . Now begin to show that you really are going to turn over a new leaf , and that your love is going to have perfect confidence , and do n't ask to see this letter . JINNY . But I do ask to see it ! AUSTIN . Then this time I must refuse you ! JINNY . What ! is it even more compromising than your letter to her ? AUSTIN . What letter ? Looking first on the desk , he looks across at her and sees it in her hand . He is angry , but also frightened for fear it has told her her brother 's secret . And you 've read it ? JINNY . It lay open on the desk there , and anyway the end justifies me ! AUSTIN . In an agony . What does it tell you ? I forget what I wrote ! JINNY . It tells me that my jealousy all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool to let you blind me ! AUSTIN . With a great sigh of relief . Is that all ? JINNY . Beside herself . " Is that all ! " Is n't that enough ? Dear God , is n't that enough ? That there 's an understanding between you and Ruth to get rid of me ! AUSTIN . If it tells you that , the letter lies ! Give it to me ! JINNY . No ! I 'll read it to you ! Reads with bitter emphasis . " The satisfaction of the visit to Brooklyn prevents me from being disappointed at having missed your telegram till too late to go to your house to-night ! " So -- you and she went to Brooklyn , did you , and that 's why you came back too late to go to the theatre with me ? You cheat ! She screams in her madness . A pause . Why do n't you answer -- why do n't you say something ? AUSTIN . Because if I speak as I feel , I 'm afraid of saying something I 'll regret all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? AUSTIN . Yes ! that is due to Ruth . Whatever you may feel about me , you have no right to insult her ! JINNY . Oh , there 's more to the letter ! AUSTIN . Jinny , do n't you see what you 're doing ? JINNY . Yes , I 'm getting at the truth at last ! Reads . " My heart aches for the blow you must have this evening ! The man who loves you --  " AUSTIN . You sha n't read any more ; you 're mad now ! Tearing the letter away from her . JINNY . I do n't need the letter , the words are burning in here ! Pressing her hands to her forehead . " The man who loves you is n't bad , only weak . However , I feel once we can shake off the burden of this present marriage "  - -  oh ! you -- you brute to say that !  --  " you will never have cause to complain of him again ! So far I have been able to keep Jinny in perfect ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now --  " Interrupted . AUSTIN . Shall I tell you the truth ? JINNY . You do n't have to ; I 've found it out for myself ! AUSTIN . In weariness , in disgust , in utter hopelessness . No ! what 's the use . You 've done it now -- let it go ! Let it all go -- the whole thing ! What 's the use ! it 's finished !  --  A knock on the door at Right . Come in ! Maggie enters and closes the door behind her . MAGGIE . Please , sir , Miss Chester came upstairs and made me knock again to see if there was an answer and if you will see her now or not . JINNY . Suddenly -- aflame with her idea . Yes ! Maggie , show her in ! AUSTIN . No , no ! What do you want to do ! I 'll see Miss Chester to-morrow , Maggie . JINNY has crossed to the door , Right . JINNY . Ruth ! Ruth ! RUTH . Off stage . Yes ? May I come ? JINNY . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face each other for a second . AUSTIN . In a lowered voice . For God 's sake , be careful ! RUTH enters Right . RUTH . Jinny ! Going to her quickly to embrace her . JINNY , without speaking , draws away and stares at her with a look of hatred . RUTH , seeing it , stops short , and looks from JINNY to AUSTIN for explanation -- she turns to AUSTIN and gives him her hand , which he takes , presses , and drops ; JINNY 'S shoulders contract at this moment ; RUTH immediately turns again to JINNY . RUTH . What is it , Jinny ? To AUSTIN . Surely she does n't blame me in any way . JINNY . Blame you ! AUSTIN . She does n't know . JINNY . That 's a lie ! I know everything , Ruth ! I know why you followed my husband to Rome , and why he sent for you to come back here . I know that you and he were in Brooklyn this afternoon , and that you only plan to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crook to marry each other ! RUTH . No !  - -  No !  --  JINNY . Oh , you can lie , too , can you ? I wo n't keep you waiting long ! You 've stolen my husband from me -- take him . I wo n't share him with any woman ! He 's yours now , and I 'll soon be out of your way ! AUSTIN . Jinny ! RUTH . To Austin . She must be told the truth . AUSTIN bows his head . JINNY . Now you 'll make up your story , will you ? I tell you it 's useless . If he would n't let me see your compromising letter , I 've seen a letter from him to you to-night that gives the whole thing away . RUTH . Very quietly . Your husband went to Brooklyn without me , as your brother will tell you , to see the clergyman who married me , or thought he married me to Geoffrey Tillman three months ago ! JINNY looks up with a start . That marriage was illegal because your brother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promise of silence this afternoon about the Brooklyn service , to prevent a charge of bigamy against your brother . The first marriage , which still holds good , was with -- Maggie , your present servant --  JINNY stands immovable . There is a silence . AUSTIN . Geoffrey is not at your house ? RUTH . No , he left when I came on here . As I wrote you in the note I sent upstairs , I was too stunned by what he told me to answer then , and I wanted a word of advice with you . She turns to JINNY . I knew what I thought was my marriage to your brother must be kept secret , but I could not learn why . This was my trouble , which , after your marriage , I selfishly laid on your husband 's shoulders , thinking he might help me ! No answer from JINNY , who stands as if struck dumb and into stone . Mr. Austin only learned the whole truth when we met that day in Rome . I did not learn till to-day that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be told , because divorce proceedings are to be started at once to break -- the other -- marriage . No answer from JINNY . To spare me , and above all to spare you the knowledge of your brother 's sin , your husband has kept Geoffrey 's secret from you . You have well repaid him ! She turns again to AUSTIN . Good-by -- I feel to-night I could n't marry Geoffrey again . He 's tumbled so far off his pedestal he has fallen out of my heart . But still -- we 'll see ; I 've told him to come to-morrow . Thank you from the bottom of my heart -- it 's full of gratitude , even if it is broken ! She goes out Right . JINNY slowly turns , almost afraid to look at AUSTIN . He stands stern , with set face . JINNY . In a low voice , ashamed to go near him . Can you forgive me ? Can you --  AUSTIN . Ugh ! Crossing room for his coat . JINNY . I 'm mad ! You know I do n't know what I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUSTIN . Never ! Taking up his coat . JINNY . Where are you going ? AUSTIN . Out of this house . JINNY . If you leave me , I 'll not bear it ! I 'll kill myself ! I warn you ! AUSTIN . Bah !  - -  Good- by ! Going to the door Right . JINNY . No ! Where are you going ? AUSTIN . Out of this house for good ! At the door he turns and looks at her . JINNY . Echoes . For good ? AUSTIN . For good ! He goes out , slamming the door behind him . JINNY stands a moment motionless . She then cries faintly --  " Jack ! " She goes to the door and pushes it open , crying out again in loud , strong despair , " Jack ! " There is a moment 's pause . She cries out again weakly , heartbrokenly , " Jack ! "  - -  comes back into the room , and throwing herself down on the floor , her head resting on her arms in the arm-chair , she sobs hysterically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what have I done ! " as THE CURTAIN FALLS ACT IV Scene I Dawn of the next day . At the rise of the curtain JINNY is by the open window , whose curtains she has thrown aside . The sky is blood-red and streaked with gold the moment before sunrise . JINNY is worn and haggard , with hair dishevelled . JINNY . Turning and leaning against the window . Day at last ! What a night -- what a night -- but now it 's morning and he has n't come back ! He means it ! And it 's my own fault -- it 's my own fault ! She shivers . She closes the window and comes away . After a moment 's pause she goes deliberately and looks at the several gas fixtures in the room . She then closes all the doors and locks them . She carefully draws down the shade and closes in the curtains of the window . She hesitates , then pulls aside the curtains and the shade , and takes a long , last look at the dawn . She closes it all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and places it on the table near the centre of the room . She then goes to the gas bracket at the Right and turns on the gas . She lights it to see if the gas is all right ; then blows it out . She then crosses to the other bracket and turns that on ; she goes to the chandelier at centre , and , mounting a chair , turns on its three jets . She then sits down by the table with AUSTIN 'S picture before her , and looking into its eyes , her elbows on the table , her head in her hands , she waits . Oh , Jack , my beloved ! I could n't help it -- I never for one minute stopped loving you better than everything else in my life , but no more than I could stop loving you could I stop or help being jealous ! Once the cruel idea has got hold of me it seems to have to work its way out ! Everything gets red before me and I do n't seem to know what I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got no excuse , only I love you ! You 'll forgive me when I 'm gone , wo n't you , Jack ? You 'll know I loved you !  - -  loved you so I could n't live without you !  - -  loved you !  - -  loved you ! She kisses the photograph tenderly , adoringly , slowly , in tears . Loved -- you -- loved you !  - -  loved - -   Her head drops forward , as THE CURTAIN FALLS SCENE II The same morning , three hours later . The curtain rises on the same scene in a dull , cold , early morning light . The lamp has burnt itself out . A tiny ray of sunlight steals through a slip between the curtains . JINNY sits by the table , her arms spread over it and her head on her arms -- she is perfectly still . AUSTIN 'S picture is before her . There is a moment 's silence . Voices are heard outside , approaching door , at Right . Gradually what they say is distinguished . MAGGIE . No , sir . She has n't been to bed ; I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's been here all night ? MAGGIE . Yes , sir . But twice in the night , sir , I came to the door and spoke to her and she would n't answer me -- but I could hear her walking up and down and sometimes talking to herself . TILLMAN . Calls softly . Jinny ! Knocks softly . It 's father ! No answer . It looks as if she were asleep now . AUSTIN . At a little distance . Father ! TILLMAN . I 'm outside the library door . AUSTIN . Nearer . I ca n't wait -- have you seen her ? Will she see me ? TILLMAN . She 's locked herself in here . She 's not been to her own room . AUSTIN . Not been to bed at all ! Poor Jinny -- God forgive me . TILLMAN . Maggie says she 's walked the floor all night . He knocks on the door Right . AUSTIN . Outside the door , Right , rather softly . Jinny ! I 'm so sorry ! I ca n't say how sorry ! I 've thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand things better . He waits a moment for an answer . Jinny , answer me ! you shall be as jealous as you like , and I 'll always explain and kiss away those doubts of yours , and I 'll have no more secrets from you , dear . Not one ! Jinny ! As he calls there is a slight movement of one of JINNY 'S arms . With a note of alarm . Father ! I ca n't hear a sound of breathing ! A moment 's pause as they listen . She threatened it -- she threatened it several times ! With great determination . We must get into this room -- do you hear me -- we must get in if we have to break the door down ! They shake the door . He calls a little louder . Jinny , Jinny darling -- do you hear me ? JINNY makes a sort of feeble effort to lift her head , but fails . Jinny , for God 's sake , answer me ! I love you Jinny -- Jinny ! Very slowly JINNY lifts her head and , with difficulty , she hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely alive . She does n't answer ! TILLMAN . See if the key is in the lock . AUSTIN . No . TILLMAN . Get the other keys , Maggie . AUSTIN . Father ! Gas ! Do n't you smell it ? TILLMAN . What ! AUSTIN . Gas , I tell you ! O God ! she 's killed herself ! Jinny ! Jinny ! Beating the door . JINNY staggers up , she tries to call " Jack "  - -  but the word only comes out in a half-articulate whisper ! She tries again , but fails . MAGGIE . Here 's a key , sir . JINNY tries to go to the door ; she staggers a few steps and then falls . They try one key -- it does not unlock the door ; they try another . JINNY half raises herself and makes an effort to crawl , but is unable and sinks back upon the floor . AUSTIN . Break the door in , father ! We dare n't waste any more time ! TILLMAN . No , this has done it ! They open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the oppressiveness of the gas in the room . TILLMAN . Jinny ! AUSTIN . Quick -- the window ! TILLMAN tears aside the curtains and throws open the window . The sunshine of full morning pours in . He then rushes to the opposite gas burners and turns them off . Kneeling quickly beside her . Jinny ! My wife ! My beloved ! He takes her up in his arms and hurries to the window . TILLMAN . Are we too late ? AUSTIN . I do n't know . No ! she 's breathing -- and see -- see ! she knows me ! she knows me ! JINNY smiles at him pathetically . Send Maggie for the doctor ! TILLMAN goes out Right . AUSTIN . Jinny , forgive me ! Forgive me ! Forgive me ! She slips her two arms up and joins them about his neck . AUSTIN kisses her . Father ! We 've saved her ! Oh , thank God , we 've saved her ! Bringing her to big chair and putting her in it , he kneels at her feet . JINNY . Whispers faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? AUSTIN . There 's one thing stronger even than jealousy , my Jinny . And that 's LOVE ! That 's LOVE ! He kisses her hands , and THE CURTAIN FALLS * * * * *
