Here is the letter : Princeton , N. 3 . , Oct. 25. 1905 . My dear Mayor McClellan : Not being a resident of New York City , I am not sure that I ought to concern myself with its municipal politics . I find it impoesible , however , to outgrow my interest in all that affects the welfare and fair fame of the city of My former residence , or to forget the kindness and con , consideration of my former neighbors .
