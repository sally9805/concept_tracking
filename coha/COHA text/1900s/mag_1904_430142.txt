 | WHOEVER would grapple with the Jewish Question must bear the burden of a heavy heart . The nature of the task , the failure of bygone efforts and the indifference of Christendom discourage initiative . Any suggestion , however , towards a settlement , if prepared thoughtfully and with labor , and presented with a humble sense of the greatness of the task , may perhaps be accepted as an attempt to answer a riddle which , the writer holds , is soluble only by harmonious action between Gentile and Jew , Slav and Anglo-Saxon , Christian and Agnostic . It is right that I should exhibit my credentials before venturing to deal with this question . My interest and public action in regard to the alien problem began in 1884 . I was then interested and engaged in a study of the social condition of the inhabitants of East London , and especially in the emigration problem . These inquiries were embodied in a book called " The Problems of a Great City , " published in 1886 . I found that , although emigration from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it supplied the great city with efficient manual laborers required in heavy works of construction , and thus mingled the blood of strong and healthy people with the anemic residents who were born in the streets . On the other hand , I found that a certain class of alien immigration , both in the United States and in England , was a national evil for seven reasons : ( 1 ) It depressed the Western standard of comfort ; ( 2 ) it impaired physical efficiency by exposing AngloSaxons to competition for which they were unsuited by diet or housing customs ; ( 3 ) it lowered the wages of unskilled women and laborers ; ( 4 ) it raised rents ; ( 5 ) it enlarged the area of and established the sweating system ; ( 6 ) it involved exclusive deal- ing ; ( 7 ) immigrants refused to assimilate through intermarriage , thus differentiating immigration of Russian Jews from the class to which belong the Huguenots of the seventeenth , and the Flemings of the sixteenth , century . For six years after 1884 , I paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planting small colonies of English laborers and artisans among the Dutch population of the Cape . The practical absurdity of exporting , or helping to export , British bone and sinew , only to see them replaced by foreigners of doubtful value , was thus forced upon my mind . During the intervals of my visits to the Cape , I attempted to raise public interest in the question of alien immigration in London , with the view of stopping the influx of undesirables , until , at last , the two Committees on Sweating and Alien Immigration were appointed in 1888 . Invited to assist those Committees , and under the belief that legislation would follow , I provided them , at my own cost , with much of the evidence for restriction . I should add that a Society for the Suppression of the Immigration of Destitute Aliens , formed in 1886 , was organized and financed mainly by Lord Dunraven and myself . I also published a book , called " The Modern Jew , " in 1899 . In the year 1890 , the late Baron Hirsch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-religionists of my efforts to rouse public opinion in favor of a measure of restriction , invited me to visit Russia , on his behalf , for the purpose of reporting on the condition of the Hebrew subjects of the Tsar , and , later , of negotiating with the Russian Ministers for such relaxations in the Russian system and regulations as would enable distressed Jews , some of whom were then coming to Britain , to avail themselves of Baron Hirsch 's plan for planting colonies in Argentina . Glad to have the opportunity of visiting the alien in his home , I accepted the commission . Five times I visited Russia with this object , and finally obtained the Tsar 's signature to an alteration of the law granting the required permissions . In the course of study and travel in Russia , I quickly discerned how superficial had been much of the evidence I had placed before the Lords and Commons Committees of 1888 and 1889 , and how completely I had mistaken the real centre of gravity . The essential facts of the case in Russia proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and Great Britain  | is but the fringe of a larger subject , and is one of greater difficulty and complexity than any matter of mere local economics . The problem to-day in the United States of America and in England , as in Russia where the centre of gravity lies , is essentially racial and international , although its more obvious and immediate effects are at present , in England and America , mainly economic . There is no religious problem . Jews are Unitarians , and Unitarians are nowhere persecuted . The evidence that the crux of the problem is primarily racial and international , rather than religious , economic , or local , lies in the facts ? and I am speaking only of the bulk of the immigrants ? ( 1 ) that orthodox Hebrew immigrants refuse assimilation , either with the Russians in Russia , with the Americans of the States , with the Arabs in Tunis , or with the English in England , just as rigidly as did their ancestors with the Gentiles in the days of Nehemiah ; and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Russians , so far from being concealed or denied , is both conscientiously felt and openly expressed by the flower of the people , especially by the poorer orthodox Hebrew immigrants . Before leaving England on my first visit , I had an interview with M. de Staal , then Russian Ambassador in London . He explained to me that the Jewish Question in Russia was entirely a matter of internal arrangement , and that he could not in any sense speak for his Government ; but that he was much interested in the matter and would write to St. Petersburg commending me to M. de Giers , who was then acting as Foreign Minister . M. de Staal then proceeded to explain why the old Edicts were removed and the Edicts of May , 1882 , revived . He denounced Prince Dolgourouki , the late Governor of Moscow , who had allowed the May Edicts to sink into oblivion , and he declared that the GrandDuke Sergius would exercise more care in the future . The manner in which the Grand-Duke Sergius " exercised care , " is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darkest Russia " ? I begged M. de Staal to assure his Government that , in the event of its giving me facilities for the examination of the Jewish Question , I should act in the matter with a guest 's regard for his host , and that it was Baron de Hirsch 's desire in all things to work with , and not against , the Government of Russia . On my way through Paris I had my final conversation with Baron de Hirsch . He gave me no instructions , but he asked me :  | " What are you going to do ? " My answer was that the clou of the whole question lay in the dormant agricultural capacity of the Jews ; that , originally , they were a pastoral theocracy , and had only been driven into money-lending and even less desirable avocations by the legislation to which they had been subjected ; and that their redemption was only possible if it could be found that they were capable of resuming the healthier methods of existence . I added that I was going to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that I should not intrigue or cabal against them , but should try and win their confidence by English straightforwardness ; and that I undertook this work mainly with the object of diverting the stream of destitute Russian and Polish Jews from England to the Land of Promise the Baron was preparing in the Argentine . As an instance of the misery then existing in Russia , Hirsch told me that hundreds of Jews walked on foot from Russia to Paris , and that twenty-five per cent . died on the way . I asked him whom he considered the best authorities in Russia on the subject , and he replied that M. Pobiedonostseff and M. Solevieff were the best . M. Solevieff is now dead . Baron de Hirsch spoke of the importance of learning , not only the agricultural capacity of those who were actually engaged in agriculture , but also of those Jews who were constrained from circumstances to inhabit cities . The credentials from Baron de Hirsch which I presented to M. Pobiedonostseff informed the Procureur of the Holy Synod that I was interested in colonization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baron 's instance , for the purpose of endeavoring to obtain information on the subject of the condition of the Russian Jews , and their adaptability for colonization in the Argentine Republic . The Baron then went on to explain the preparations he had made in the Argentine for the organization of the work of colonization ; and he added that , although he was using every possible effort to expedite the arrangements , considerable delays were inevitable . I duly presented my letter to M. Pobiedonostseff . I had many conversations with him , from which I gathered that the following are the reasons for the action deliberately adopted by the Russian Government against the Jews . I use M. Pobiedonostseff 's words : @#  | " 1 . The characteristics of the Jewish race are parasitic ; for their sustenance they require the presence of another race as host , ' although they remain aloof and self-contained . Take them from the living organism , put them on a rock , and they die . They can not cultivate the soil . " 2 . Can Russia become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Jewish artisans are not really artisans , only colorably so ; and they adopt the calling of artisan in order to become brokers , hucksterers , and middlemen . A recent examination made by the Minister of the Interior proved that , out of thirty watchmakers , only two knew their trade ; the other twenty-eight were colorably watchmakers , but really money-lenders and middlemen. " 3 . The influence of the Jews on the drinking habits of the Russian people has been terrible , while the houses of ill fame are almost entirely kept by Jews . " In reply to a question as to whether the Jews were not themselves industrious and temperate , M. Pobiedonostseff declared that their temperance and their industry were fatal to the Russians , and that the country was mapped out for exploitation by the Jews ; that the peasants cried to the Tsar to help them ; and that it was the duty of the Church to obey that call , and to assist the Imperial power in maintaining the sacred nationality of the Russians . It was true that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to them were exaggerated ; but , whatever they were , they could not be relaxed . On another occasion , M. Pobiedonostseff said that he was not an Anti-Semite : that there was no quarrel between him and the Jews ; but that his action was dictated entirely by the resolve to preserve Russia from the evils which had already invaded Western Europe , and which in the course of another ten years would probably become a danger to the English-speaking nations and to France . At a further interview M. Pobiedonostseff told me that the Jewish Question was " insoluble . " It was not a question of religion : it was a matter of race . Religion had nothing to do with it ; but the Jews invariably raised the cry of religious intolerance when they were attacked for inordinate usury or cruelty in money affairs . He spoke of the drink and education questions . Since this conversation the Russian Government has taken into its own hands the sale and distribution of vodka , while a disquisition on the education question in Russia need scarcely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same  | scale as snakes in Iceland . The Jewish Question , said M. Pobiedonostseff in one of our conversations , " was an insoluble problem and mystery , the ultimate issue of which was only known to God . " He read me his answer to Baron de Hirsch 's touching appeal , and he disclaimed any power to abate the present steps now being taken . He spoke of the dirtiness and the ignorance of the Jews ; and , when I asked him how they could be anything but ignorant and dirty , under the present method of administration and their confinement in a Ghetto which left them no alternative but death or resort to undesirable pursuits , he answered that : " Russia would be a nation of middlemen and under the dominion of the Jews within a few years , if Government did not rigorously intervene . " I suggested to him that Russia , having made the Jews what they are , punishes them for the result of her own act . After detailed investigation of the miseries and capacities of the Jewish population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him of many things he did not know . He showed great ability in his answers . He professed entire ignorance of the measures taken by the police , thereby disassociating himself from the stringency with which these measures are enforced . The difference between Pobiedonostseff and Torquemada seems to consist mainly in the fact , that Torquemada interested himself in the executive details of his policy , and thus earned his title to the infamy which posterity has attached to him . M. Pobiedonostseff , unlike Torquemada , has made a point of delegating to others the executive details of his policy . He has preferred to remain ignorant of what has been done in the name of Holy Russia . The result is , that the Pobiedonostseff policy has been carried out with a precision generally associated with laboratory experiments on rabbits and dogs , pinioned , but not drugged , for the knife . It is a failure . During my investigations in Russia I received the greatest assistance from M. Pobiedonostseff . The various Governors knew that whatever the Minister of the Interior , then M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pobiedonostseff who was the Emperor 's friend ; and , this being the case , I found that M. Pobiedonostseff ' s autograph letter recommending me to the various Governors was an " open sesame " in my journeying . The letter described Baron Hirsch 's plan and recommended me to the Governors as a " trustworthy man , " undertaking from Petersburg an excursion through  | Russia having in view to examine the Jewish population , paying attention especially to trade , their qualification for agriculture , and to their condition and way of life , and their tendency to cleanliness or dirt . Further , in this matter I had the warm and powerful support of the late Sir Robert Morier , then British Ambassador , whose friendship I prize as one of the dearest memories of my life . Sir Robert Morier told me that Lord Salisbury , then Prime Minister , had written in favor of my mission . I had already been warned by Lord Salisbury that the power of the British Ambassador to help me was necessarily limited by considerations arising out of the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following paragraph from Lord Salisbury 's letter to me , having regard to the present state of the Jewish Question in Russia : " It would be at variance with his Sir Robert Morier 's duty to interfere with the internal affairs of Russia and especially to concern himself with current questions of controversy on which the rulers of that country are sensitive . " M. de Giers ( whose name in Russian is pronounced Hirsch ) , received me several times ; and , after my return from the investigation , on more than one occasion he sent for me at midnight , as he apparently took more interest in the subject than was explained on the surface . At all events , on one occasion the tears rolled down his face while I described to him , at midnight , the condition of some little Jewish children I had seen at Homel . I believe that M. de Giers was a Jew by race , and felt that strange unquenchable loyalty towards his race which is an indelible characteristic of the Chosen People . I mention M. de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shared more openly by the late M. Wischnegradsky , the Finance Minister . On more than one occasion , M. Wischnegradsky told me that M. Pobiedonostseff 's policy was contrary to every interest which he , the Finance Minister , had to protect . I have little doubt , though I am not authorized to say so , that M. de Witte shares the view of M. Wischnegradsky ; and I am convinced , without anticipating the sequel , that the present advisers of the Tsar are firmly of opinion that the time has come to review the whole circumstances of the case , and that , without handing Russia over to the middlemen , as feared by M. Pobiedonostseff , it is their desire to ascertain whether it be not possible , in ,  | some shape or another , to secure Russia from the evils she dreads , while at the same time giving to the Jews greater latitude for legitimate expansion , and substituting for the Pobiedonostseff policy a wiser and broader conception . From what I saw in Russia during the next five visits that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Baron de Hirsch 's plan was foredoomed to failure ; that the task of dealing with the Jewish Question was not only beyond the power of any individual , however rich or influential , but beyond the power of any nation , even of Russia herself ; and that the partnership of Christendom was necessary , if civilization is to be redeemed from the horrible scandal of the Russian Pale , and of the Ghettoes which are already established in the United States of America and in England . Reports of the massacres which from time to time take place in Russia rarely reach the Western Press . Only the worst of them obtain publicity . In 1897 , after the massacres of Schpola and Kantacouzene , I again visited Russia for the purpose of seeing Russian Ministers . I saw the Minister of the Interior , M. Goremykine , and M. Pobiedonostseff . The latter was now becoming a very old man , and he murmured the same reactionary doctrines that I had heard six years before . The Jews were more numerous , the situation more acute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But still M. Pobiedonostseff held firmly that the law of self-preservation required the treatment of the Jews which has created an enemy for Russia wherever a Jew exists outside that land . The Jews of Russia are loyal to the Tsar . They cling to the Russian soil as their motherland . In the summer of 1897 when I saw M. Pobiedonostseff , I suggested to him the necessity of finding a practicable alternative to Baron de Hirsch 's plan , and that Russia herself should take the initiative . He listened attentively , and shadowed forth the idea of a portion of the Armenian territory of the Sultan , which was rich and depopulated , being possibly available for the use of a portion of the Jewish population of Russia . M. Pobiedonostseff pointed out that contact between Armenians and the Jews would not be injurious to the former , and that , therefore , the evils which existed in Russia would not be reproduced in the dominions of the Sultan .  | As regards the United States and Great Britain , the Jewish Question in Russia is already creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even more serious evils , in the near future . The United States regulates immigration in such wise that certain minimum qualifications are compulsory on would-be citizens of the United States . In England it is otherwise . Rents are raised and the standard of existence is lowered by the colonization of Russian undesirables ? a process justified in the sacred name of the " right of asylum . " The foreigners who settle in England are almost entirely of the Jewish race , and it is , therefore , impossible to touch the question of foreign immigration without raising the Jewish Question . The children of the Hebrew immigrant still regard the Goyim , or Gentiles , as undesirable persons for their children to marry . The Italian immigrant is blended with the English by the third generation . No assimilation takes place in the case of Russian Jewish immigrants . Thus impelled by racial tradition and constrained by religious principle to keep their blood pure from contaminating intermarriage with other races , the Jewish immigrant communities , whether rich or poor , form a separate island in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial islands is beneficial or otherwise must be judged by the facts . The main point to remember is , that the larger proportion of the immigrants belong to a race and cling to a society that prefers to remain distinct and aloof from the main stream of our national life . Intermarriage is the most powerful , if it be not the only , solvent of racial distinction . Free intermarriage is banned by the Jews . 1 could fill an octavo volume with evidence as to aloofness , but I will only quote from a letter of air . George Dulberg , M.D. , printed in the " Jewish Chronicle , " on August 31st , 1900 : " Judaism is not a religion merely , like Catholicism or Protestantism : it is a brotherhood , a race , if you like ; and that it will remain as long as there are two Jews left in the whole world . Say what you will , no matter how an English Jew or a German Jew may love and feel for his English or German neighbor. he will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew , even if that other Jew may come from the other end of the world . " The man who has been accustomed to sleep twelve in a room all his life , is in a better position to accept work for which he is  | paid sixteen cents a day , working fourteen hours a day , than a man who is accustomed to 400 cubic feet of space , a wage of two dollars a day , and a diet that includes meat , fowl and beer . With regard to the food absolutely necessary for an American working-man , and the food required by the immigrant Jew , Mr. Seebohm Rowntree 's studies are interesting . According to this gentleman , who has made a special study of the subject , 3,500 calories of food energy were required as the diet of an ordinary American working-man in moderate work . The minimum cost of this food is 72 cents each per week for adults , and 30 cents each per week for children . The Russian Jews subsist well on half this amount . What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , 52,000 foreigners , or another 100,000 into New York , whose diet contains a smaller number than 3,500 calories , which is the minimum required to keep an American working-man in ordinary health ? The Hirsch millions were intended for Jewish colonization , and for the benefit of the distressed Russian Jews now in Palestine . Has not the time arrived to use them ? When the Kishineff massacre occurred , I determined to visit Russia again , in pursuit of the same object that I had in 1897 after the massacres of Schpola and Kantacouzene . The difficulties in the way were enormous , as American public opinion , justly indignant , was articulate in a manner better calculated to increase the sufferings of the Jews in Russia , than to bring Russian statesmen into a reasonable frame of mind . I had expected to be received by the Emperor . In fact I had left England for the purpose , but on my arrival at St. Petersburg I found that the Emperor was unable to receive me , nominally owing to his numerous engagements . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was based on the fact that his confidence had recently been misplaced , and that a gentleman who undertook not to publish certain statements of the Emperor which he was permitted to hear , communicated them to the press . I had , however , long interviews with Count Lamadorff , M. de Plehve , M. Lopoukhine , and Baron de Giinzberg , the head of the  | Jewish community in Russia and one of the noblest and holiest of men , held in high esteem by Russian statesmen . The arguments I ventured to place before Russian Ministers , on behalf of the Jewish inhabitants of the zonal provinces , were based on the assumption that the Kishineff massacre is not a Russian domestic question , but one of grave international concern , pressing closely on the laboring classes , male and female , of Great Britain and America . Neither the American Republic nor the British Monarchy desires further Jewish immigration for its own sake . The duty of governments is to protect their own people , and I have little hesitation in declaring that before long ? Kishineff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balfour 's Government and the Congress at Washington to take further steps to arrest the colonization of congested cities in Britain and America by Polish and Russian immigrants . What form should that action take on both sides of the Atlantic ? Is it to be purely selfish ? Shall it be callously indifferent alike to the tragedy of the Pale and the dilemma of Russia. ? Or is the action of the English-speaking peoples to proceed on the large lines of wisdom and humanity ? Surely the latter . If the Prime Minister of Britain and the President of the United States were , jointly and severally , to address to the Government of Russia an invitation to a conference on the whole Jewish Question ? not with the object of placing pressure upon Russia , but with the view of consulting with her on the difficulties of a complex problem which affects the three Powers , but which it is utterly beyond the capacity even of Russia to solve for herself ? there is reason to believe that Russia would not sullenly refuse to entertain the idea . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only adroit and technical diplomacy , but heart and mind and knowledge . Since 1843 , Russia has not enlarged the area available for her Jewish subjects , although the Hebrew population in the zone of the fifteen provinces has quadrupled . The difficulty , however , with Russia , in dealing with the Jewish question is not land , but money ; the trouble with England and America is not money , but land . It is even possible that Russia herself might take the initiative and invite the Anglo-Saxon Powers to a Conference . Russia knows how to be magnanimous and to rise to the level of a great occasion .  | Where is the money to come from ? There are three sources . First , there are the Hirsch millions . These millions should be used for the purpose intended by the Baron ? if not in the Argentine , then in Russia or near Russia , as may be decided after inquiry by the three Powers concerned . The status of the Company can be altered . Secondly , there is the vast wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thirdly , there is Christendom as the backbone of the scheme for obtaining funds for the ransom of Israel . Our national interests and our individual duty are for once identical . To contribute towards the settlement of the Jewish Question means nothing less than AngloAmerican partnership with Russia in a great humanitarian object . This may lead to a closer understanding and friendlier relations between the Powers . No Power can settle the Jewish Question by itself . We can solve the Jewish Question hand in hand with Russia to-day : to-morrow , it may be too late . There is a claim on Catholic and Protestant , on the Greek Orthodox Church , on the Agnostic , on the Episcopalian , and on the Nonconformist alike . It is a call on the whole human race , in which Russia and the AngloSaxons must take the lead , and bear the white man 's burden . It is they who must take counsel together . The main principles of the scheme may be summarized as follows : 1 . England and America must examine the question anew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regards the Jews , not as inspired by futile brutality , but as dictated by the first law of nature , self-preservation , and by the duty of rulers towards the majority of their subjects . 2 . The Jewish Question is insoluble by any single nation . Even Russia is impotent if she acts alone . 3 . The Jewish Question is a world problem , and therefore international in its essence . 4 . To solve the Jewish problem a Conference between Russia and the Anglo-Saxon Powers is essential , in order that the problem as it affects each Power may be understood by all the parties concerned before its solution is attempted . 5 . The Russo-Anglo-American Conference should adopt the principle that Russia should provide territory and that the other Powers should find capital for the establishment of the redundant  | Jewish population now multiplying in the Pale , to their own misery , and the certainty of eventual bloodshed and revolution . 6 . The necessary capital should consist : ( a ) of the funds of the Jewish Colonization Association as a nucleus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shall be invited to suspend their generosity to rich nations until the congestion of the Jewish Pale is relieved , and the Jewish problem solved , by the settlement of their co-religionists in territory of adequate size : ( c ) of contributions from Christians of all nations , who believe that the race to which their Founder belonged has a positive and primary claim on their charity and their good-will . All that is asked for to-day is the acceptance of the principle , that civilization is dishonored by the present state of the Jewish Question , and that before a solution is feasible the three great nations must understand the problem . I have reason for saying that the Ministers of the Tsar would not summarily reject proposals for a dispassionate examination of the Jewish Question , if these proposals are made in such a way as to promise the attainment of the object aimed at , viz. , the solution of the Jewish Question . The Memorandum which I have prepared for the perusal of the Tsar is as follows : MEMORANDUM . " The question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a question of international concern . An outbreak of infuriated debtors against their auditors at Kishineff raises rents in the poorer districts of London and New York , by stimulating the emigration of the Jewish subjects of the Russian Emperor . " In the twentieth century , civilisation can no longer resort to the methods of the Middle Ages . Jews can no longer be slain in masses , sold into slavery , or suddenly deprived of their property . Adequate protection to the Jews , however , is difficult eves in Russia , because public opinion is too bitterly opposed to them . " Since the Jewish question is international and of world-wide importance , a Conference between the representatives of the Emperor of Russia , of the President of the United States of America , and of His Majesty King Edward VII. , is necessary . For these Powers are jointly interested in the final disposal of an unbearable situation . " Since 1843 , when the Jewish subjects of the Emperor were settled in the fifteen provinces of Russia , their numbers have multiplied fourfold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bourgades in the South of Russia , the poverty and distress of the Russian Jews are acute , and the settlement of emigrants from the Pale in the large cities of Great Britain and America reproduces evils which are apparent to all Russians . The development of further evils may be predicted in the near future . " By the appointment of a conference between Russia , the United States and Great Britain , to meet in St. Petersburg , with instructions to report to their respective Governments within a reasonable time , say four months , both the Western Powers and Russia would obtain a complete survey of the international situation as affected by the Jewish Question . " The advantages from such a Conference would be , firstly , recognition by the Powers that the Jewish Question is a matter of international , and not local or national , concern ; secondly , that , the interest of the civilized world once concentrated upon the problem , the matter could not be shelved or postponed until a settlement had been discovered ; and , thirdly , the conference would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject have already done , that the provision of more land , the equipment of agricultural colonies , and the grant of adequate territory within or adjacent to the dominions of the Russian Emperor , are the only methods by which the Jewish Question can be solved . " The failure of Baron Hirsch 's plan is an indication that no individual is strong enough to deal with it . Even Russia is baffled by the immensity of the problem . " International co-operation is , therefore , necessary . If Russia will provide the land , Christendom should provide the money . Where is it to come from ? There are three sources : " ( 1 ) There are the Hirsch millions ; " ( 2 ) There are the subscriptions of the wealthy Jews throughout the civilized world ; " ( 3 ) There is the appeal to Christendom , which could not fail to produce extraordinary results if every one who bears the name of Christian were to give a piece of silver ? some to help Russia in her holy mission of settling the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to benefit the race to which the Founder of Christianity belonged . " It is plain that the invitation from the Ministers of the Emperor to the Governments of the United States and Great Britain would create an extremely favorable impression on public opinion throughout the civilized world ; while , if the initiative were to proceed from any other Power than Russia herself , it might be said by enemies of Russia that she had yielded to the force majeure of public opinion . To take the initiative , therefore , in the convocation of a Conference for the discussion of the Jewish Question throughout the world , would place Russia in secure possession of the leadership of the world on this subject , and would establish incontestable proof of her magnanimity and statesmanship . " In conclusion I would point out that , wherever there is a Jew , there Russia has an enemy . Jewish influence in the Press of the United States , of Great Britain and of the Continent of Europe is directed against Russia . Although Russia is morally and materially self-contained , and de- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending the Jewish Question is indisputable for financial and diplomatic reasons . " While no harm would result from such a Conference , the position of Russia in reference to the Jewish Question would be set forth with a strength and clearness that could not be gainsaid . ARNOLD WHITE . " I have reason to believe that this document , with a memorandum on the whole subject , has also been placed before the President of the United States . Russians , like Americans , are proud . Gusts of emotion sweep through the land . Threaten Russia , or denounce her Government , and the door of conviction is closed with a clang . But Russia has other moods . She is not wholly represented by M. Pobiedonostseff . I have no authority for saying so , but the impression I have gained from recent conversations with Russian Ministers is , rightly or wrongly , that the Pobiedonostseff methods are no longer found satisfactory . The only influence that can prolong them is the denunciation of the American and British Press . If , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands to Russia , and say , " Let us see what we can do together to solve this terrible problem of Jewish misery , " I have reason to believe that Russia would hold out her hand , and , notwithstanding Manchuria , Persia , Central Asia , India , and the open door , that the Powers might act together in the discovery of a remedy which shall at least alleviate , if it does not cure , the evils of which we are conscious . The amelioration of the lot of the Jews throughout the world is no fit subject for political ambition . It is the duty of every Christian and of every non-Christian to put aside causes of difference , and to join hands with the object of ending the journeyings of the wandering Jew .
