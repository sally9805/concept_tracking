 |p1212  SOME little time ago a very bright Southern lady , writing in the columns of THE INDEPENDENT , twitted us of the North because , while we held up our hands in horror at evidences of what we called race prejudice , displayed by Southern folks against the negroes , we ourselves were entertaining what , she insisted , was quite as virulent and much more absurd race prejudice against highly intellectual , highly polished and entirely harmless people called Jews . Now , then , is the lady 's charge true ? Do we intelligent , or more or less intelligent Gentiles of the North really cherish such a prejudice ? That leads us to the examination of the word prejudice , which means a conclusion arrived at without the aid of testimony or evidence . Gentiles deny that they have any prejudice , and usually , for purposes of publication , deny that they have any anti-Jewish feeling . But any one who makes a careful investigation , such as the writer has just concluded , among prominent Jews and Gentiles , must arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is strong and widespread , and that it is increasing rather than diminishing . Listen to the voice of a leading rabbi of Brooklyn , who has made a study of anti-Jewish feeling among Gentiles : " In spite of the fact that many of the great department stores are owned by Hebrews and patronized chiefly by Gentiles , I hear that there is a little commercial prejudice against Jews ? that many Gentiles say , ' We wo n't go to a Jew store . ' But the leading manifestations of anti-Judaism are social ? the fraternal societies particularly societies whose very foundation sentiment is the promotion of universal brotherhood , make use of all sorts of excuses to keep out Jews . Most Masonic lodges keep out Jews , tho there are some lodges that are almost entirely composed of our people , thus segregating them from the general brotherhood of Masons . So it is thruout the other fraternities , and tho we have fraternities of our own , we find it mortifying and humiliating that we are excluded from the general social body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . In fact , so far as the authorities are concerned ? the faculties and university officials ? I never heard of a case of discrimination . They set a good example of liberality . But among the students it is different . They draw aloof from their Jewish comrade , and , to a greater or less extent , send him to Coventry . He finds he ca n't get into the fraternities . He finds he ca n't get on the athletic teams , no matter how competent an athlete . He does n't like that at all , for he has the same social instincts as others . But if he inquires why , and manages to secure from any quarter an honest answer , it is " ' Because you 're a Jew . ' " Many of the leading private schools refuse outright to receive young Jews as pupils , and others again will take them if their names are not ' too Jewy . ' For instance , I hear that the Hotchkiss School , of Connecticut , which had two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohen because Cohen would look bad in the catalog ; sensitive Gentiles would lift their noses at the sight and say : The Hotchkiss School takes Jews ; I will remove my children . ' The school would admit any young Jews whose names might be Gentile German , or Russian , or English , but not a Levi , a Cohen , a Moses or a Solomon . " And the hotels . The great hotels of New York , as a rule , do not discriminate against Jews , yet I have heard that some show they have no love for us . " For instance , a young woman belonging to one of the most prominent Hebrew families in the city desired to give an  |p1213  entertainment to her friends , and selected the Plaza Hotel as the scene of the festivities . When she went to make the arrangements for the room she was asked for references . She gave leading merchants and bankers . ' Oh , ' said the hotel official who questioned her , ' we did not want financial but social references . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Plaza was beyond her reach . " Whatever joys the Four Hundred may have , we are altogether cut off from them . " But the great hotels , at least , do not exclude Jews from among their guests as do so many of the summer hotels ? the resorts at seaside and mountain . All thru the Adirondacks you will find antiJewish prejudice rampant . Many of the hotel circulars and advertisements announce frankly if not brutally that no ' consumptives , Jews or dogs ' are taken ? pleasant classification for us . " At one of these Adirondack hotels a young Hebrew lady with small children was recently refused shelter for the night tho the wilderness was around . She could not buy even a glass of milk for the children . " Every one knows about the prejudice exhibited against Jews by the management of the Manhattan Beach and Oriental Hotels . This has extended over many years and has led to the exclusion of some of the most cultured Hebrew families in the country with no other reason than : " ' Because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unmistakable . " I have heard lately that some Jews were taken at the Oriental Hotel last season , so , maybe , there has been a change of policy there . " Most people will remember the case of the Hotel Renaissance , of New York , how the tenant wanted to transfer the lease to one John Doe and the proprietor found out that John Doe was a Jew and refused his consent ? the anti-Jew prejudice is widespread among the apartment houses . " Then in the clubs we are met by the same prejudice . We find ourselves excluded , for instance , from the University and Union League Clubs ; even the Crescent Club , of Brooklyn , draws the line against Jews . " And the same in society . Our young people make progress for a time and then there falls , a sudden chill and they find themselves exposed to slights and even insults . The Gentiles have discovered that they are Jews . " True we could have our own summer resorts , our own hotels , our own society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less extent , we do so ; but is it right , or just , or healthy for the country that we should thus be held off at arm 's length from the general body ? not to speak of the teachings of Christianity on the subject of , human brotherhood ? " I wonder , if Christ , a Jew , were to return here among us how many Christians would pay heed , to him and his teachings . " " Rabbi , " I asked , " What is the reason why Gentiles do not like Jews ? " " I judge that it is a part of the general and world-old prejudice against strangers . Some of the same prejudice exists between people of different nationalities and different religions . We find prejudices between Protestants and Catholics , even between various denominations of Protestants . The prejudice against the Jew is stronger because he is more completely alien in race , in customs and in religion . " " What do you think of Mr. Zangwill 's Melting Pot ' idea , that the Jews should give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mr. Zangwill himself married a Gentile and that may have affected his manner of looking at the matter . I sec no reason to believe that any large number of our people arc ready to desert their trust . There are many indifferentists who have lost touch with the synagogs and there are many Reformed Jews who have cast off old customs , but few have turned to Christianity and the main body still plods faithfully along the old path . " Even the few individuals who have turned to Christianity are not sure of escaping the anti-Jewish prejudice . One man , who married a Christian woman and turned Christian himself , found out later on that he had not by those means escaped the prejudice , for when his daughter was old enough to go to a certain high class school she found herself  |p1214  excluded on account of her father 's Jewish name . So then the family changed their name and probably completed the melting process . " But to the religious Jew such an escape from uncomfortable conditions is quite impossible . He believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Mission and that come what may and stiffer what he must among the nations he must be true to that Message and that Mission . " So . said the Rabbi , and the writer felt that he spoke truth ; but did he tell all the truth ? Was he mistaken in part ? Was there really nothing in this dislike of Jews by Gentiles except what could be accounted for on the ground that the Jews were looked upon as aliens and strangers ? It was not easy to get frank testimony . Merchants , officials , hotel men , did not care to speak out . When they spoke at all they stipulated that their names should not be mentioned . It was only by putting many testimonies together that one was enabled to get the Gentile side of the case , which may be fairly presented in this manner " We have no prejudice against the Jews . We do dislike them but it is dislike based on knowledge and evidence which is so widespread and so general that it has resulted in an instinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jews . The dishonest among them are out of all proportion to their numbers . No other people so persistently , shrewdly , cunningly , constantly , skim the very verge of crime , and many go over the verge . " Police Commissioner Bingham was right in his idea about the large proportion of Jewish criminals , but wrong in the specific charge that he made : He did not mean misdemeanors , as his Hebrew assailants pretend . He meant felonies . In certain crimes where cunning is especially needed the Jews furnish most of the criminals , altho they are only about one-quarter of the population of New York . Take arson , for instance , arson committed , not by a crazy firebug ? some degenerate boy whose insane fancy is pleased by the sight of flames ? but arson committed by a cunning shopkeeper who wants to collect insurance on the building and on stock that most likely he has secretly carried away and hidden on the premises of a fellow plotter . That is a typical Jew 's crime , and so common among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies declared that they would no longer take risks on property owned by men whose names ended in ' ski ' or ' sky . ' But that was an easy problem for the would be criminals to solve ? they simply took other names . " Take fraudulent bankruptcies accompanied by all sorts of swindling and perjuries . That is another crime in which Jews are pre-eminent . " Every railroad claim department has its pack of Jewish wolves following it up with swindling claims put forth by Jewish lawyers for Jewish clients , and bolstered up by false affidavits of Jewish pretended witnesses . There are plenty of Gentile swindlers here , too , but they are not so numerous , so well organized , so clever , so unscrupulous , so well equipt with trained , perjured witnesses . " Jewish pickpockets , too , are numerous out of all proportion to the number of their race in comparison with the rest of the community . The prisoners tried in the Night Court are mostly Jews . " All the officials who have to do with crime know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear the Jewish vote . They are like tight-rope walkers . A slight push would upset their balance , turn them out of power and put in the other political party . And Jews can give a big push . " It was only a little while ago that we saw the Jews beat Tammany Hall and put the Republicans in power . " We all felt that the Jews were right in that particular fight . They cast their votes to do away with conditions that were spreading vice thru tenement houses and corrupting their own young people . Yet the exhibition of their strength certainly did not tend to allay the feeling against them . " We felt their solidarity . They could throw their strength on one side or the other as they chose , and could hold the balance of power . Both parties had to placate them and have since had to pretend love for them . " We do n't care a pin about their re/ ligion ; we do n't believe that they have any religion that counts . Go into one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you believe that they are practising their religion . It calls for many ablutions , but men , women and children show plainly that they do n't wash . Most look as tho they had not washed for years . They are known to their neighbors as ' The dirty Jews , ' and their habits give the Health Department officials infinite trouble . " Look at them and the surroundings that they make and see if it is possible to believe that these are a chosen people ? a people with a Mission and a Message . f they have a living religion how comes it that they have so much swindling , so much arson , so much perjury , so much fraudulent bankruptcy ? " There is another thing against the Jews . They are too prosperous . Where they contest they win . Five or six years ago , after the French Ball , there was a fight and the-victor stood over the body of his antagonist and proudly proclaimed : The Jew is always on top . ' The fact that the man whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth he had uttered . The Jew is winning everywhere . By fair means or by foul means he wins . He has the commerce of the city in his hands now , and the signs on Broadway make one think of the main street in New Jerusalem and make Gentiles curse Titus and wish that he had never been born . Why could n't he leave them alone in Judea ? Perhaps they might have stayed there ? As to the possibility of a great Zionist movement , it 's too good to be true , ! " One tentacle of the Hebrew octopus has caught our newspapers now , and we also see Jews running our theaters and giving us a drama that never before was so low . We see the Hebrew octopus seizing one enterprise after the other , and we ca n't stop it . They are beating us . " They beat us in the schools , in the colleges , in business ? everywhere , and we are not used to being beaten and do n't like it . We Aryans of the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country of America we have , by various means , induced the original inhabitants to retire or oblige us by dying . Then we have thrown it open , calling upon the opprest of all lands to come to us and enjoy freedom . And the opprest have come in immense numbers and we have been able to assimilate all ? all except these Semites , who have been under the heels of our forefathers for twenty centuries and who now , given entire freedom by us , and equipt with knowledge by our schools and colleges , are showing that they have the stuff in them to conquer the conquerors . " Jews are not liked socially because of their qualities . They do not respect reticence and reserve ; they do not regard the conventions . Admit a Jew to your acquaintance and he instantly becomes intimate and familiar . He will poke into your private affairs , he will read a private letter over your shoulder . If you leave him alone in your office for a minute you can not be quite sure that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and he will immediately find some other Jews to introduce to that great man so as to show them that he is on terms with him . He loves the limelight and will push any one aside in order that he may stand in it . He is both conceited and vain and will spend money in order to secure applause ? as Kipling has said : ' Like a young Jew trying to appear white . ' " Two or three Jews at a summer resort utterly spoil the place for the Gentiles . The first thing that the Jew does when he gets in a hotel is to bribe the head waiter . He must have the best steak , the best of everything , and be served first , and he is so persistent , so acute , so eager and so willing to resort to anything to get his way that he does get his way and makes every less strenuous person about him so uncomfortable that they 'd sooner leave the place than contend . If he sits at a table near you and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into you utterly spoil your repast . If you give your children new toys and send them out to play you will find in half an hour that the Jew children have the new toys while your youngsters are looking on . The young Jews are not violent , but they get what they want by reason of their greater appetite for it . They 're insatiable and can only be represt by force ,  |p1216  " Admit Jews into your club or fraternity and you find that they are not content with a modest place . They must lead . They push their way forward indefatigably , and if repulsed or rebuffed cry out , ' Race prejudice ! We are persecuted on account of our Religion . ' Very recently , when the public ownership movement began , some people who went into that movement in good faith found that a young Jew had pushed himself to the front as president . He was very restless , very crude , very presumptuous , but he spent more money than any others , held the meetings at his house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started up he attempted to deliver all his comrades to it , with officers dictated by its leaders . Evidently he was a decoy duck financed by the Independence League people . Some of the solid men of the ' Public Ownership organization asked the calm , observant district leader : ' How did you come to put such a fellow as that in as president ? ' and he answered : ' Can you tell me how it was possible to keep him out ? ' " Admit Jews into society and you find you have added some very charming , highly cultured people . Lovely young ladies , intellectual young men . All goes well maybe until some Gentile young man falls in love with the Rose of Sharon and proposes to marry her . The Gentiles may have some misgivings , but they would give way and let the wedding proceed : not so the Jews . All the synagogs turn out to assail the would-be bridegroom with strange cries and gesticulations and stranger weapons , till one is reminded of the story of the Jew who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon that , after a hasty glance around to assure himself that the coast was clear , he dived into a little restaurant and regaled himself in a manner forbidden by his law . When he issued forth again he found a fearful thunderstorm raging . The lightning flashed , the thunder rolled , and the Jew , looking up at the sky , half in terror , half in reproach , exclaimed : ' Oh , vot a row , vat a row dot iss to make apout such a liddle piece of pork ! ' " The man who proposes to marry a Jewish woman feels at once the full bitterness of the hatred which Jews cherish for Gentiles , and finds that every Jew makes it his business to throw every possible obstacle in the way of the marriage . The would-be bridegroom finds that he is not marrying the girl alone , but her whole tribe , and that he must give up all to them . And there is an equal Jewish outburst against the Hebrew man who marries a Christian woman . She can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends . In their midst she is still a Strange woman . " How foolish , then , to associate with these people when there can by no means be any real assimilation . " That is the way the matter looks to intelligent Gentiles . As to the ignorant among them , the words of the poem set forth his feeling : " I do not like you , Dr. Fell , The reason why I can not tell ; But only this I know right well I do not like you , Dr. Fell . " They tell a story about a Tammany captain who heard that one of his retainers was going to vote the Republican ticket because the candidate for judge was a Jew . The captain cornered the culprit in a saloon and began on him : " What 's this I hear about you , Muldoon ? you 're going to vote against Tammany Hall ? " " I wo n't vote for a Jew . " " Who got you your job , Muldoon ? Your makin ' three dollars a day thru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that , but I 'll not vote for a Jew . An ' me sons wo n't vote for a Jew . " " Who was it that saved your son from jail ? " " You did , but all the same I wo n't vote for a Jew . " " And who got your girl the job in the public schools ? " " You did , but I wo n't vote for a Jew . " " Now , Muldoon , you 're a sensible man ? just listen to reason . Was n't Jesus Christ himself a Jew , an ' did n't he turn Christian , an ' may n't this man turn Christian , too , if he gets a job from Tammany Hall ? " The chronicle goes no further . " But , " somebody asks , " where is the proof of all this ? for instance , of the undue prevalence of crime among Hebrews ? " Dear sir , there is n't any .               @ @ @ @ @ @
