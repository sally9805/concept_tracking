txt President Roosevelt will probably issue the statement which it was reported the four railI road Presidents were to ask him to issue , whether they come to see him or not . He so expressed himself to his visitors last night . The President has received no Information that the four men are coming to see him , and it does not seem that he expects them . He never invited them , nor even intimated that he wanted them to come . 3 . Pierpont Morgan suggested that the Presfeent receive them , and the President replied that If they came he would of course be glad to see them . This Is Mr. Morgan 's own version . After he visited the President he announced that he /lad made ssch a suggestion . His version I 's the correct one . If anywhere in the country the impression has got abroad that any sort of invitation was Issued by anybody in Washington , even indirectly , it is a mistake , for which Mr. Morgan 's statement affords no explanation . ConSequently the announcements from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received no invitation are quite correct . - Nor are they likely to receive any . The President will be glad to see them if they come , just as he has seen Mr. Morgan . and more recently Mr. Speyer and Mr. Stidkney , but it is not necessary to send an emissary like Mr. Morgan to range for such an interview as that . The President sees everybody . In fact , it looks as if Mr. Morgan , in his endeavor to impress on the country in a spectacular manner the danger of the financial situation , had Somewhat overreached himself . Mr. Morgan has called on the President many times , and is very well aware that in order to get a conference wth the President it is not necessary to send a millionaire on ahead in order to make the arrangements . Mr. Morgan has , however , been endeavoring most industriously to call public attention to the seriousness of the financial status , and if he had any other object than that in his dramatic visit to President Roosevelt and his subsequent sensational announcement no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's statement about his attitude toward railroads and other corporations Id not dependent upon their officials visiting or staying away . If they do not come , , he will probably issue it anyway . If they do , he may issue it before they get here , or hold it over until after they have left . When he issues it he will undertake to repeat as emphatically as possible what he has said so often before , to the effect that he is not an enemy of the corporations as such , and that corporations which are properly conducted have nothing to fear from him  --  that in fact he is their best friend . He will also make It plain that he is not going to back down at all or change his policy in the least . Incidentally it might be interesting to mention that his message to the Sixtieth Congress will contain new recommendations for control of inter-State corporations , The subjects which he now contemplates mentioning are Federal appraisement of railroad properties and Federal franchises for inter-State corporations . No explanation has been given at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deneen and Attorney General Stead of Illinois , who will be here on Saturday . It is generally connected . however , with the question now arising of the point at which Federal and State regulation of railroads meet . Illinois is reported to be going after E. H. Harriman in connection with the Alton deal . The President is said to have given considerable attention to this subject , and there are even rumors that the Atto. - sey General has been asked to look into it . A. B. Stickney , President of the Chicago , Great Western Railroad , visited the President to-day and urged his idea that the Federal Government should take over practically the entire legislative control of railroads . Mr. Stickney is resisting a decision of the State authorities in Minnesota and bringing the case before the Federal Courts . He is confident the Supreme Coyle will back up his views on the subject of Federal and State control of railroads . Inter-State Commerce Commissioner Harlan was quoted in a Chicago paper some days ago as taking a view on the quiet similar to Mr. Stickney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with the President to-day about the financial situation .
