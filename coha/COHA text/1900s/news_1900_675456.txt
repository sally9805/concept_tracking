txt It seems that the conference of District Assemblies of the Knights of Labor , headed by " No. 49 , " has done a foolish thing in ordering a bill to be drawn which should put Japanese immigrants on the same footing as Chinese . It would not be the first unwise action of the organization in question . No. 49 has promoted some very crazy and foolish strikes which did much harm to the men engaged in them and left itself much less influential than it was before . If it could have its way it would be adding to the number of more or less suicidal things it has done by excluding Japanese as Chinese are already excluded . But it is not very likely to get its way . In the first place , the Chinese exclusion law is one of the most disgraceful and perfidious statutes ever passed birz  --  n American Congress . It is an open and clear violation of treaties that pledged the National faith , / which the statute shamefully broke . That law was the demand of organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition with labor native or previously imported at all pressing or even noticeable . And we have no evidence that Japanese labor is so now in any part of the country , unless Hawaii is to be taken as part of it . Everywhere else a Japanese is employed as a salesman of Japanese goods , as a domestic servant to somebody who has been in the East , or in some other capacity where he can not be said to displace any other labor . He is employed to do things which otherwise would not be done . Before proposing to exclude him , common sense as - well as common justice would require evidence that he was doing some harm to somebody . , Some of the cooler heads in the Assemblies seem to have suggested that some information on the subject should be acquired before any action was taken . But the opinion of the majority was that a bill should be drafted to exclude the Japanese , without waiting for the facts . Congress is not likely to take such a bill very seriously .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
