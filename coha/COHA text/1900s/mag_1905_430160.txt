 | MOST discussions of the servant question are ineffectual because the writers stop to dwell on the details that are wrong instead of going down to the underlying principles . They dwell on the respective faults of manner or action in mistress and maid , overlooking the fact that the evil lies much deeper , in the nature of the system , which is out of harmony with the industrial tendencies of the present day . Our domestic system is patriarchal in character and belongs to another age . No individual nowadays can claim personal control over another individual beyond the age of childhood and have his claim honored . So long as he insists on this right , he will encounter insubordination and antagonism . The first thing , then , that we mistresses have to do is to range ourselves on the side of our maids , to help them to their rights , rather than to fight them . At every sacrifice , we must free service from the conditions that make it more distasteful than other pursuits to intelligent , self-respecting girls . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies on " living out ; " the rest of the road is comparatively easy . That such a stigma can be removed is shown by the position of clergymen to-day and a century or two ago when they were considered a sort of upper servant ; it is shown in the present freedom of women to earn their own living without losing caste . If domestic service were free from this stigma , we should have a better class of women in it , and if we had a better class of women in it , it would be free from this stigma ; the question is so completely circular that it is hard to find an end to pull . Let us begin by trying to entice a few brave pioneers from other fields into our service . How to proceed How shall we proceed ? By forming societies with the avowed purpose of elevating domestic service and giving dignity to it . What can these societies do ? They can spread abroad the idea that the last thing on earth we want , if we are women of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tyranny of convention and precedent ? the last thing we want is to keep our servants in their present places . Instead w , , e will make new and better ones for them , places that American-born girls can be proud and happy to fill . The members of these societies will bind themselves to observe certain conditions in dealing with their maids . In the first place , they will require only ten hours of work a day , the time out of hours being absolutely at the maid 's disposal . These hours may be infringed upon only by the maids ' consent and extra work will be paid for at a certain fixed price an hour . If washing is done at home , so many pieces shall constitute a week 's wash , any excess to be paid for . There shall be but two regular meals on Sunday ; if there is a third , it shall be prepared and cleared away by the family ; no servants shall have more than five hours ' work on that day . Maids shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they themselves request to be called by their Christian names . They shall be permitted to receive friends freely out of working hours , being given , in every possible case , a sitting room of their own . They shall have their meals in this room in an orderly comfortable fashion , and shall be interrupted when eating only in case of an emergency . Servility of manner shall not only not be required , but shall be discouraged . Politeness only will be expected . Maids shall be allowed to be human beings , not expected to be automatons . Each home an academy These are only a few specimen rules . Besides the formal regulations , there shall be unwritten agreements among the members about ways of adding dignity to the position . Here two seemingly incompatible aims will have to be reconciled . Domestic service can be elevated only by setting it apart from the family life , by rendering it as impersonal as factory or shop work , by making the contract between mistress and maid a purely business relation : at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually , the office , by her employer 's taking an active personal interest in her . The raw emigrant is too far away from us to be helped except to a few words of English ; but what can a  | wise , cultivated mistress not do for a clever , American-born girl with a good common school education ? Such a girl has no chance in the shops or factories when she comes in personal contact with no one superior to herself . In a home , the mistress could lend her books , introduce her to art and music , take her to art galleries and an occasional concert , advise her about her clothes and her lovers ; best of all give her the benefit of seeing for herself higher standards of life than any she has known . A home could be an academy . The idea is a fascinating one ? if we could catch our hares . Of course , such advice must never be ex-officio : that is contrary to the scheme . It is only that being brought into contact with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know , a woman would have a chance to keep them as friend to friend , not as mistress to servant . No mistress would have the right to advise or assist her maids ; this should be a privilege granted only by individual to individual . A high standard of efficiency The members of these societies would in a short time be put on a white list at the employment offices , and other mistresses would be forced to follow their example ; or , better still , the societies would have employment offices of their own , requiring a certain amount of education , intelligence and refinement in the maids on their books . They would admit no immigrant or colored help ? not , heaven forbid ! through any desire to discriminate between races , but because they were attempting to achieve a particular purpose . Girls going into the households of the members would , therefore , have some security against distasteful fellow workers . They would be encouraged to combine into working forces of two or three , as in that delightful story of Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kate , two sewing girls thrown out of work by the Boston fire , go to live out as cook and housemaid . There is so much wisdom in this little story that one wonders it has not had more perceptible effect . Probably the reason is that it deals with the relation of individual mistress to individual maid , rather than with underlying principles . The members of these societies must be prepared to disregard convention ; they must be wise , bold women with the courage of their convictions , indifferent to the opinions of the unregenerate . They must rank their servants as they would ? or should ? rank their friends , on their own merits , not as members of an inferior class . If , by some happy chance , they achieve a maid worthy of being a friend , they must recognize her as such , remembering always that such recognition has no bearing on their business relation , however much it may enter into it . Men in their offices manage this sort of thing much better than we do in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a housemaid whom on occasion one would want to invite into one 's drawing room to meet a guest ; not because the business relation prescribed such action or even made it desirable , but because she was original and interesting enough to be worth while on her own account . The greatest factor in bringing about such a state of affairs would be for the employer to show publicly , as by her action in joining these associations , that she was ready to allow social advantages to the servant when she shall have proved herself fitted for them . I can imagine also a large minded , unselfish mistress encouraging her maids to form clubs for both profit and amusement , to invite their friends . to spend occasional evenings at her house , when the refinement of the maids was such as to become a guarantee for the behavior of their friends . I do not see why the maids in their part of the house should not have the same freedom as guests in a boarding house . These can not invite their friends to meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other occupants of the house . That maids should be subject to the same restrictions as boarders can certainly be no indignity nor hardship . If the social stigma and a few of the most oppressive disadvantages of domestic service could be removed , its many advantages make it more desirable than any other work for the majority of women . These advantages are so well known , so often enumerated , that they need not be dwelt on here . Personally , if I had to earn my living with my hands , I can not imagine more congenial work than the care of an attractive home , provided always that one 's personal freedom was respected , that one was allowed an independent life out of working hours , that one was permitted to be a human being with a recognized right to thoughts and feelings of one 's own . The obligation to bury their individu-  | ality that we have laid on our servants is so heavy a one that I do not wonder they have rebelled and have preferred hardship in other employments to comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mistresses in the old world , but what right have we Americans whose very existence is due to the craving for freedom , what right has any one of us to enslave that wonderful thing , a human personality , for the gratification of his vanity , the enjoyment of his own importance ? The wrongs of our servants toward us , many as they are , are overshadowed by our great initial wrong to them . Our grievances concern themselves with the acts of individuals ; theirs with principles upon which the fabric of our lives is built . Thus the criticism of the regulations of the servants ' unions has been superficial ; it has been taken for granted that the old order of things is sacred , inviolable . And yet the hours for meals have changed with every generation ! Before the Revolution , the French government insisted that any reduction in the exorbitant taxes the people had to pay was an impossibility ; slave holders before the war declared that slaves were an absolute necessity ; at every critical point in history we find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet the change comes , often bringing ruin and destruction with it . It looks as if this were something in the nature of a domestic revolution or rebellion that we have entered upon ; as a mere matter of policy ; then , would it not be wise to act while we can and save as much of the old order as possible ? Break away from non-essentials The conservatism , not to say pig headedness , of women , their attachment to the unessential , has been at the bottom of many revolutions . Fortunately , in the one in question , this will be offset by the fact that we have women on the other side ; many of them are as attached to the old order as we are . Remove their grievances , and these will be with us instead of against us . The argument that their grievances can not be removed , that they are in the perverse uneducated brains of those that hold them , is contradicted by the conditions of labor in other fields . If they were due to mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shops and factories . The objection has been made the regulations suggested will spoil the relation of mistress and maid by substituting a business basis for a spirit of mutual ac- . commodation . This I doubt . If the right spirit is there , it can not be hurt , and if it is n't , cheerful work for value received is much preferable to grudging , gratuitous services . Will add to the cost of living This adjustment of the servant question would certainly add to the already increasing cost of living , which comes so hard on people of small fixed incomes with no capacity for increasing them . No doubt such people will have to give up some luxuries and refinements of living that they now enjoy . Socially speaking , they will have to live on a lower plane . A great many pretensions , external elegancies , will have to go . It was so at the beginning of the last century in England , at the time of the Napoleonic wars , when oppressive taxes , high prices and the disturbance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former value . Many a retired major had to black his own boots and to substitute beer for wine . Apart from money considerations , the advantage to mistress and maid in the new arrangements will be unquestionable , because it will replace unwilling service with willing . There is not anything intrinsic in the nature of the work of our households that makes it incapable of being dignified . There is no social stigma on a woman 's doing the same work in her own home ; and that doing it in those of others is considered humiliating is merely an idea that can be gradually overcome . The profession of trained nurse is deemed most honorable ; and yet there are no duties in a home that can compare in distastefulness with the duties of a nurse . That this profession is now respected is because of the class of women who engage in it . The most encouraging feature of our domestic difficulties is that their solution can come gradually ; it is not necessary that there should be a concerted national movement , as in the freeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare a little emancipation proclamation of our own the moment the truth comes home to us , as it is bound , sooner or later , to come home to every fairminded , progressive woman , the truth that we have been demanding that which lies outside of justice .
