 | The phrase " New South , " which used to be dinned into our ears with such wearisome persistency , we seldom or never hear now . If it is living at all , it is on the tongues of schoolboys as they shout forth in their declamation exercises such speeches as those of the late Henry W. Grady , ? speeches which , in a way , thrilled us all at one time because they voiced the very natural emotions of a particular period in the history of the South . This period came in the early seventies when , closely following the actual pain of the fracture in southern life due to the war and the passing of the immediate peril of Reconstruction , there were seen the beginnings of that industrial revolution which has so largely transformed the South . The phrase , then , became the key-note of the new times , and was resonant both of the spirit of adaptation to them , and of the hopes which we were then realizing . Of course , in it there was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but after making even a generous allowance for this , we must insist that it was the perfectly genuine expression of the transition period from the agricultural South to that South whose entire commercial and industrial system has been transformed into something other than it was . Furthermore , we do not hear this phrase now because it has served its use , and that of which it was the rather noisy expression has already been brought about . This economic reconstruction is the most obvious thing about Southern life to-day . Turn where we may , and the factory and the mill are its concrete witnesses , and on hearing even in South Carolina , for example , nothing but " factory-talk , " one must feel that the reconstruction has gone astonishingly far , that one finds himself literally in a strange new world , in which the term " Commercial Democracy " has a taking effect . It is evident , then , that these new conditions are necessarily modifying our political and social thinking . Shout as we may of the political faith of our fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things  | that have long charmed and lulled the South into a slumberous conservatism ? and still the sure , steady march of change is calling for a strikingly new and unfamiliar leadership . To the South this leadership ? the leadership capable of shaping in practical ways the new forces ? has not yet come . The politician has lagged behind ; and , though he has gone into office ? as he thinks because of the old-fashioned principles which he advocates ? the fact remains that on account of changed commercial and industrial conditions , the political thought of his constituents has been correspondingly modified , and they only await the strong man to speak for them , and consequently to lead their politics into line with the other phases of their life . No less striking , no less significant , has been the reconstruction of literary thought and method that has been going on in the South since 1870 . It is the purpose of this paper to point out some of the elements in this reconstruction ? if I am still permitted to use this word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude toward this discussion , we shall have to take a backward look , and bring out briefly yet frankly certain conditions and characteristics that ought to be so well known as to need but the barest restatement . That really pathetic phrase , Southern Literature , we are never allowed to forget . On the other hand , one never hears the books written by Longfellow , by Lowell , by Emerson , spoken of as Northern Literature . Have they appropriated so much of the spirit of the nation as to give them the sole right to be called American writers ? At any rate , something , either inherent or conventional , has saved them from the taint of provincialism implied in any other naming ; while we always hear of Southern Literature and Southern writers as if we had no share in the larger name , American . This localizing designation of literary effort in the South ? at once a distinction and a reproach ? came out of those well known social , political , and economic conditions which , before the war , kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word is not too strong ? to maintain the high value of whatever it regarded as sectionally its own . This spirit was applied to literature as it was applied to everything else , and the result was the multiplying of books and periodicals under the  | emphatic and rather challenging title of " Southern . " But the significant thing about this cry of the South for a literature which should be peculiarly its own ? its own as distinguished from that produced elsewhere in the nation ? is that the cry was the sign of the excessive intellectual loneliness and detachment forced upon the South by the very conditions of its life . It was a sign , too , of our failure to understand these conditions as related to literary production . Scattered agricultural communities , the stunting poverty of popular education , a rural aristocracy ? rich in social virtues ? based upon negro slavery , the prodigal expenditure of intellectual wealth to defend and maintain this system , the isolation that comes of being not only out of sympathy with the progressive thought of the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrowing of idea and effort inevitable from such isolation , and the resulting suspicion and only too prompt resentment of outside suggestion , and criticism , ? these , not to mention others , are conditions that furnished an atmosphere unfavorable , to say the least , to the growth of literature and to the spread of intellectual influences . These causes of comparative literary failure in the South before the war have become so recognized by students that to restate them thus , even in general terms , is really stating what seem now to be outworn commonplaces . But such a recognition is the first essential element in the intellectual emancipation of the South by the war . We now know that the atmosphere in which literature flowers must be a broad and a free one , ? an atmosphere vital with those deeper movements that touch the common heart of man . The result has been that , with all the pain and pathos of the tragedy of the war , with all the confusion that followed the collapse of what is known as the Southern system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people in trying to walk the unfamiliar and devious paths of the new conditions , this more liberal atmosphere has been fast converting the South into a receiving and a giving agency in the national thought and literature ; and Southern Literature ? we hold to the phrase from force of habit ? is not now a name for peculiarities and sentimental gush , but it stands for a fresh , first-hand , brave , liberal treatment of life and nature , past and present , in the South . This is to say , further , that we must be at least approaching that point which  | Matthew Arnold had in mind when he said : " Now to get rid of provincialism is a certain stage of culture , a stage the positive result of which we must not make of too much importance , but which is , nevertheless , indispensable , for it brings us on to the platform where alone the best and highest intellectual work can be said to fairly begin . " Now in this general movement in the South toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements that have helped to make it so vital and so rich in fruit : the first is the wholesome and genuine interest which the Southern people themselves have been taking in their own life and history ; and secondly , the interest which the outside world ? a larger world whose influences and forces we are rapidly making our own ? is displaying with reference to all matters pertaining to the South . This interest of our own is of a wholesome nature because it is felt that it is no longer necessary to be aggressively polemic when the word " South " is mentioned ; indeed , it is clear that the old idea that even Southern history must be always on the defensive , that it must carry " a chip on its shoulder , " is fast vanishing ; and as a matter of fact we now desire to know the truth for its own sake and for its lessons , however sharply our lingering sensitiveness may be pricked by it . Consequently , he who writes about the South now can be sure of not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ? a body of readers , if not keen to know the truth about themselves , certainly willing to hear it . It is important , moreover , to remember that such an attitude in the reading public is bound to have a saving effect upon the integrity of the product of the writer . A public that will not be misled nor beguiled even by the stupefying sweetness of patriotic sentimentality to which it has been so long used , is just the kind of public to quicken the energies of authorship , to stiffen its moral courage to say what it thinks , and to get out of its vision the squint of sectional bias . And it is only at the demand of such a public that what is really best in thought and literature can live a permanent life . In the same way , and yet in other ways , is the interest of the outside public significant in the general reconstruction of Southern literary thought . It is calling attention to what has become a matter of general recognition to say now that Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years or more , monopolized the pages of the leading magazines . This avidity on the part of the outside world for everything Southern has had the important use of creating an active demand , which the Southern writer feels that he must supply , and that he alone can supply in a just and adequate way . Moreover , in thus giving to him the call of a wider and , indeed , a more critical , public it has also given him the incentive of greater remuneration . Art is high : art at its best is ideally noble , free from even a hint of sordidness ; but because the state does not take care of him , as Mr. William Dean Howells once suggested in a magazine article that it should do , the artist , needing to be fed , clothed , and sheltered , must get the reward of his labor ? a reward coming like that of other men through the channels of trade . This wider and more critical public and the incentive of greater remuneration have not only stirred Southern writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their methods and aims of work . This outside public has put upon the writer the compulsion of specific training and discipline . This necessarily has quickened his conscience as to the body as well as the spirit of his utterance . This new public , with the rewards that have come with it , has made it possible for the Southern writer to become a literary artist if he has the divine impulse in him . For example , whatever of failure one may attribute to the works of Mr. George W. Cable and of Mr. James Lane Allen as complete performances , one is perfectly sure that each of them has , by a vigorous process of self-discipline , steadily developed a certain artistic quality of his nature , till there is the finer flavor of what is mere literature upon all each has written . The new conditions we have been discussing have made it possible for each to be , not ? as was almost always the case under the Old Regime that made of literature a mere accomplishment and no serious pursuit for men to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a lawyer with a taste for letters , but first of all a man of letters clinging to his art as the very staff of his life , as a jealous mistress brooking no rival . That each is thus able to follow his art and , indeed , to live by it explains the artistic excellence of the general mass of books written since 1870 by Southern men and women . And this artistic excellence we must not lose sight of in the impressive- ness of the sheer quantity that the stimulating atmosphere of the new conditions has evoked . Not only does the artistic quality of the work of recent Southern writers attract us , but also its individual note and the variety of material used . Each has virtually stayed at home and revealed with conscientious fidelity and clear-sighted independence the common human stuff found there . But to call the roll of Southern writers since 1870 , together with a bare reference to the field covered by each , is to make definite these statements . Margaret J. Preston embalms for us in tender verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathos of the war . Samuel Minturn Peck sings with graceful touch the praise of beauty and love . Sidney Lanier is Southern , but with an artistic passion for perfection , a depth of seriousness , a largeness of utterance , and an attempt to compass the greater things of life and nature ? all of which lift him into the company of those who make the literature not of the South , but of the English-speaking race . George W. Cable gives us the different phases in the life of the Louisiana creole with rare insight and romantic richness of local color . The same section , both in the days long ago when Louisiana was in the making and in our own day with the shadow of the tragedy of the war still heavy upon it , finds sympathetic treatment at the hands of Miss Grace King . By Charles Egbert Craddock we have faithfully drawn the mighty panorama of our Southern mountains , together with the lives of the simple , but intensely human , folk who inhabit its valleys and caves . In the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor and tragedy of mountain life . Joel Chandler Harris , with a tender sympathy and gracious humor , interprets the essentially human touch in the negro , in the Georgia Cracker , and in the aristocratic planter . Richard Malcolm Johnston appropriates for himself something of the same field . The negro in his relationship to his white masters , the romance and nobility of that splendid Virginia civilization of which both were essentially a part , the beating of the fiery fury of the war upon this civilization , the pain of building anew upon its ruins , are made vitally real things in the novels of Mrs. Burton Harrison and of Thomas Nelson Page . The late Maurice Thompson , after interpreting in exquisite verse and prose the beauty of Southern landscape , the nobility of Southern ideals ,  | and the songs of Southern birds , closes his literary career with a novel saturated with the strenuous heroism , the brave adventures , of pioneer days in the middle West . James Lane Allen , with a carefully wrought art , a refinement of manner that betokens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental motives , has woven into a series of artistic patterns the richly colored strands of Kentucky life . I close this list by adding the name of Miss Mary Johnston , who , seizing upon the early colony days of Virginia , has crowded into a series of three novels a prodigal wealth of moving incident , related in a style that is real , full of vital power , and , without being tawdry , warm and varied in color . This is clearly a remarkable roll-call , ? remarkable for the essentially individual talent awakened by the new conditions and for the variety of fields and interests it has claimed as its own . This drawing of Southern life in all its phases by the pen of the romanticists , this singing of Southern moods and ideals by poets that breathe this larger , keener atmosphere is bringing us into a vivid psession of what we have been and what we are . We read the works of such writers not only for the joy we have in all good work , but for the help they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are contributing to the better understanding of our life and history through the less winning guise of lectures , critical essays , and history . They have shown themselves sympathetic students of Southern affairs as well as artists in the realms of fiction and poetry . We need but mention in this connection the lectures and essays of the late Maurice Thompson , and his History of Louisiana ; George W. Cable 's Silent South and other essays ; Thomas Nelson Page 's Old South Papers ; the introductions Joel Chandler Harris writes for many of his dialect stories ; Mrs. Burton Harrison 's historical essays appearing from time to time in the magazines , and Miss Grace King 's History of Louisiana , her History of New Orleans , and her accounts of Bienville and of De Soto . It is clear , then , that this reconstruction of Southern literary thought is seeking to know itself in all its relations . There is another class of writers ? not strictly men of letters ? who are serving the same important use . And their work and its high value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | glaring work of the romanticists . Not a few Southerners are engaged upon studies in literary , political , and economic subjects that affect the South directly or indirectly . Professor Woodrow Wilson , for example , has written what is perhaps the standard account of a critical period in the history of the nation in his Division and Reunion . Professor W. P. Trent , in his life of William Gilmore Simms , has given us what is probably the most philosophical treatment of Southern literary conditions before the war ; and the publishers announce from him a History of American Literature in which we can be sure that the South will have adequate treatment . In his Southern Writers the late Professor W. M. Baskervill interpreted in a singularly candid , luminous , persuasive way what was doing in literature in the South since ' 1870 ; and Colonel Edward McCrady is doing a monumental piece of work in his History of South Carolina . Now the really tonic element of the work of such men , ? the element that makes it mean so much in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its merely intrinsic value a deeper worth , is that they are not engaged in these studies for sentimental reasons ; nor have they apparently a thought of the defence of a greatly abused section ; but disciplined in the methods of scientific research , they are led solely by the calm and imperious demand of the scientific spirit to know the truth . Jeer as we may at much that these writers say which does not please us because ? as was particularly the case with Professor Trent ? they probe too deeply old wounds , offend our pride , or seem ruthlessly to handle things regarded as sacred ; still in the end we shall know our life better for the scientific method and spirit in which their work is done . At any rate , that they are working with such a method and under the impulse of such a spirit is itself a sign of one of the elements making for better intellectual conditions in the South . But the scientific method and spirit , ? the systematic search for fact and law , the passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transforming university and college instruction and aim in the South . There is no considerable institution for higher education that has not opened itself hospitably to these forces and is not now pursuing its work under their impulse . The medium of transmission has been an increasing number of young scholars trained in the best universities of this country and of  | Europe , and strongly imbued with the spirit of productive scholarship . The result is that they are making this ? the spirit of productive scholarship ? the very atmosphere of the Southern university and college , and in this atmosphere the men who are to lead in shaping our economic , social , political , and literary conditions are training . But the more immediate effect is that in all the considerable institutions one can be sure of finding a capable group of graduate students pursuing special research in Southern fields ? fields so inviting for their engaging freshness and intrinsic value that both professors and students are entering with singular avidity upon the conquest of them . In this connection it might seem a trifle invidious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing for all . Yet the work , particularly of the history department , of the Johns Hopkins University has been of such a quality , both in the training of men in methods of research and in the actual results achieved , that it must place this institution in a class all by itself . With a wisdom , which its subsequent history and its far-reaching influence in training Southern men especially in the methods and aims of productive scholarship , have amply justified , this university really transplanted what was best in German university ideals to America . Hence it comes that the Hopkins trained man , wherever you find him , is an investigator , a producer , and by the placing of one or more of its graduates in almost every Southern institution of any importance , Hopkins methods and ideals have been multiplying with the spread of an influence that can not now be computed with anything like definiteness . But the general direction and nature of it can be inferred from calling the titles of a few of the works embodying the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Maryland Manors , Local Government and Free Schools in South Carolina , Virginia Local Institutions , English Culture in Virginia , The City Government of New Orleans , The Religious Development in the Province of North Carolina , White Servitude in the Colony of Virginia , Local Government in the South and Southwest . This list , of course , could be increased to formidable proportions ; but the titles chosen sufficiently represent the character and variety of the work done . Moreover , if the results of such investigation are not real history , they are certainly a  | gathering of the material of history from the standpoint of the scientific student , and through them the South is knowing itself better . With fewer graduate students to deal with , work of the same kind is done at other Southern institutions ? at Vanderbilt , at the University of the South , at Trinity College , at Tulane , at the University of Texas , and at the University of Virginia . Moreover , at some of these institutions , to the special investigations through departments , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent , interest aroused by the historal associations that have been comparatively recently organized ? associations organized for the purpose of preserving material , stimulating and guiding research , and keeping vital and intelligently active the historic sense . For the furthering of such important aims , we find the Southern Historical Society of Vanderbilt University , the Randolph-Macon Historical Society at Ashland , Va. , and the Trinity College Historical Society , Durham , N. C. , especially active and effective . It is probable , too , that there are others equally active ; I mention these only by way of illustration . Not only in the colleges and universities of the South is to be found this vitalizing of the historical consciousness . It is not thus confined . The new conditions of Southern thought have inspired the organizing of new associations all over the South , and have infused fresh vigor into those already formed . We know how active , for example , the Southern Historical Association , Washington , D. C. , with its bi-monthly publication , is in recording historical effort in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local , such organizations as the Athenee Louisianais , New Orleans ; the Tilson Club , Louisville ; the Tennessee Historical Association , Nashville ; the Public Library and Historical Association , Macon ; the South Carolina Historical Association , Charleston , are enlisting , in their respective communities , the co-operation of the most intellectual men and women . It is clear , then , that they , too , must be reckoned among those forces now making not only for a better understanding of our history , but for a general clarifying of Southern thought . More popular in nature , more loudly sentimental , and naturally less intelligently directed , yet in their way contributing towards  | keeping alive the historic sense and interest and helping to furnish the atmosphere in which men may study Southern conditions , are the various memorial associations ? the Confederate Veteran Association , Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution , and Colonial Dames . It is a great misinterpretation of the actual plans and purposes of such organizations to say that they are but conserving partisanship and nursing from speedy death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only too publicly now and then in their meetings ; but the air of the new times is too keen and penetrating for it to live long as a dominating force . They are rather ? these organizations ? the media for the more popular transmission and diffusion of the better and more permanent forces of our historical and literary awakening . At present the hum of machinery , the ceaseless rattle of spindle and loom , furnishes the rather loud music of our industrial and commercial reconstruction , ? so loud , indeed , that we are in danger of hearing little else . This makes it especially important that we should halt now and then and take note of that change in Southern literary thought that we have been discussing . It stands for the coming of a larger intellectual atmosphere in which one may think with absolute independence ; the keen and fructifying interest which the South itself is taking in its own life and history ; the inspiring call which the outside world is making upon Southern authorship ; the mass , the variety , the artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who are investigating Southern conditions and history , and the scientific spirit and method under which they are working ; the application in Southern colleges and universities of this same method to Southern themes ; and the more or less popular organizations for keeping alive the historic sense , for stimulating research , and for clarifying Southern thought .
