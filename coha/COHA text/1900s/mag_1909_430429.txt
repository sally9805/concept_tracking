 | THERE has been no lack of interest in politics since the din of the election died away . The convening of Congress , the preliminary steps taken by the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives in the matter of tariff revision , the resentment expressed in the House because the President uttered some views in his annual message which did not please the members of the lower branch of Congress , the resurrection of the Brownsville affair in a message from the President followed by a spirited debate in the Senate ? these are but a few of the incidents which have afforded topics for discussion in the national capital . The session last year was as calm and peaceful as a summer sea . The election was pending and inaction was the adopted programme . Now the elections are over and there is greater freedom on all sides . The members who have been defeated are under no obligation to remain quiet , while those who have been returned have not the fear of an immediate campaign before their eyes . This situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of these days , if the American people ever amend their Constitution , it will be worth while to give careful consideration to a proposition which will avoid participation by a defeated member in further Congressional deliberation . Under the present system an election is held in November and the Representative who has been repudiated by his constituents returns to Washington to wield a free lance . Sometimes defeated members do not take the trouble to return to the capital , and even if they do occupy their seats they are naturally under the disad-  | vantage of having been discredited at home . If there is no extra session ? and these sessions are held very infrequently ? the new member does not appear in Washington until thirteen months after he has been chosen . By that time the issues which were paramount in the campaign may have entirely disappeared , and , at any rate , it seems absurd for the newly elected Representative to remain away from his post of duty for more than a year . The English system seems more sensible . In Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved when the ministry is overthrown . The question at issue is at once submitted to the people , and when the result of the election has been made known , defeated members retire to private life and their successors enter immediately upon the discharge of their duties with the vital issue uppermost in their minds . If it were not for the extra session which Mr. Taft has decided to convene early next March , the members of the House elected in November , 1908 , would not take the oath of office until December , 1909 . It is a long interregnum , and some plan ought to be devised whereby it can be avoided . There is another anomaly in our political system which ought to be corrected . No provision exists for filling the office of President between the time that formal declaration is made of the result of the count of the electoral votes and the fourth of March , should the newly elected President die or become disabled in the meantime . The Constitution does not , contrary to the general belief , provide that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor is elected and qualifies . The President 's term of office is specifically limited to four years . He goes out of office at noon on the fourth of March . Up to the present time , there has never been occasion to discuss the question of his successor . If , through some ill fortune , the problem should be presented , it is difficult to tell how it would be solved . Many years ago the late Senator Hoar , who was a great lawyer as well as an able statesman , emphasized the existence of this grave omission in our form of government and attempted to rectify it by suggesting a Constitutional amendment , which he proposed should be submitted to the several States for ratification , as follows : Article XVI . In all cases not provided for by Article II , clause 5 , of the Constitution , where there is no person entitled to discharge the duties of the office of the President , the same shall devolve upon the Vice-President . The Congress may , by law , provide for the case where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President or Vice-President , declaring what officer shall then act as President , and such officer shall act accordingly until the disability shall be removed or a President shall be elected . This amendment was passed by the Senate , but failed of enactment  | in the House . Consequently , if the calamity of Mr. Taft 's death should befall the country , there is no Constitutional solution of the question as to Mr. Roosevelt 's successor . It is barely possible , in such a contingency , that the electors in each State , although they had once convened and registered their votes for President and Vice-President , might again assemble , and , in a second ballot , vote for the Vice-President to fill the office of President , transmitting this record to the seat of government of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . There is no Constitutional provision , however , for this second convention , and the proceeding would be , at best , a makeshift . It would be much better for Congress to realize that no provision has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested and remedy the defect as promptly as possible . It is not a political question , in the partisan sense of the word , but it deals most vitally with the uninterrupted continuance and stability of executive authority . It seems strange that no action has yet been taken , and so averse are the American people to altering or amending the Constitution that . it will probably necessitate the occurrence of some catastrophe to awaken them to a realization of the situation . The annual message of the President ? a document , by the way , of more than usual interest and ability ? contained one paragraph which aroused the resentment of Congress . After an investigation by the Committee on Appropriations , in which it was shown that the duties of officers of the United States Secret Service had been considerably diverted from the original intent of the law , Congress , at its last session , provided in the bill making appropriations for sundry civil expenses , that these secret service men should confine their work to the detection of counterfeiters . In commenting upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but emphatic . Without quoting the entire paragraph , its tenor may be gathered from these three sentences : It is not too much to say that this amendment has been of benefit only , and could be of benefit only , to the criminal classes . The chief argument in favor of the provision was that the Congressmen did not themselves wish to be investigated by secret-service men . But , if this is not considered desirable the repeal of the law a special exception could be made in the law prohibiting the use of the secret-service force in investigating Members of Congress . It would be far better to do this than to do what actually was done and strive to prevent or at least to hamper effective action against criminals by the executive branch of the government .  | This declaration aroused considerable indignation in Congress , especially in the House , and a resolution was introduced and passed authorizing the Speaker to appoint a committee of five Members " to consider the statement contained in the message of the President and report to the House what action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This committee has requested the President to furnish to the House the basis of his statement and the Senate proposes an investigation of the secret service . The President is thus afforded opportunity to make further contribution upon the subject . The invitation of the House is undoubtedly most welcome to him , for he does not go into a struggle unprepared ; and he must have foreseen that his utterance would not be accepted without rebuke . The episode is interesting because it recalls the famous incident of the vote of censure passed by the Senate of the United States in 1834 , when the national bank question was the great issue in American affairs . The resolution was introduced by Henry Clay and declared " that the President , in the late executive proceedings in relation to the public revenue , has assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the Constitution and the laws , but in derogation of both . " This resolution of censure was passed by a vote of twenty-six to twenty . The question of expunging the resolution from the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fealty in succeeding elections , but it was not until January , 1837 , three years after the passage of the resolution , that the Jackson party secured a reversal of the Senate 's action . The record is still to be seen in the Senate files . Heavy black lines are drawn around the page of the journal which contains the objectionable resolution , and across the latter are written the words , " expunged by order of the Senate , this sixteenth day of January , 1837 . " It will be interesting to see whether the House will pass a resolution of censure , and still more interesting to observe whether , in the future , the resolution will be expunged . Jackson felt very keenly the action of the Senate and regarded the final expunging as a personal victory . Mr. Roosevelt , if the House takes formal action , will certainly endeavor to convince the country that he had ample ground for his utterance ; and that he is able , in a public debate , to handle himself with vigorous strength has been more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to be broken , the next Congress will give the country genuine tariff revision . Mr. Taft has served notice upon the leaders in the House that he will be satisfied with nothing less than an honest reform in the schedules , and Speaker Cannon and Chairman Payne , of the Ways and Means Committee , have both indicated their desire to accomplish this result .  | In considering revision , Congress will , of course , be confronted by local interests ; and these interests are not confined to any particular section nor to one political party . In Massachusetts there is a demand for free hides from the Argentine Republic and a tariff upon boots and shoes and leather goods ; in Texas and Wyoming and Iowa and Nebraska , the cattle raiser insists upon a tariff on hides and free entry for boots and shoes and leather goods ; the wool grower in the West wants a tariff on his product , while the manufacturer in the East would like his raw material , as he calls it , to enter free ; Alabama and Pennsylvania are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the builder and the contractor would like to know why steel rails sell more cheaply in England than they do in this country ; the furniture manufacturer in the Northwest wants free lumber from Canada , and the owner of the pine forest in the South seeks to increase the duty on the Canadian product ; and the beet sugar manufacturer in Michigan and California prays for protection against the sugar cane of the rest of the world . The hearings which are now being conducted by the Ways and Means Committee indicate the extent of these antagonistic views ; and it will take wise statesmanship to adjust all the differences so as to avoid injustice . Then , too , the gauntlet of the Senate must be run . For many years the Senate has had the final and all-important part to play in the framing of a tariff bill . This was especially the case when the measure which had been prepared in the House , under the leadership of the late William L. Wilson , came into the hands of the late Senator Gorman and was returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enacting clause . In order to account for the decisive part played by the Senate in the final adjustment of the schedules , it is necessary to refer to the conditions which exist in the two Houses of Congress . In the lower branch the bill , when it has been reported by the Committee on Ways and Means , will be taken up for discussion . A few days will be devoted to general debate , and then , at a certain day and hour to be fixed by the Committee on Rules , a vote will be taken upon the measure , even though there may remain many pages of details which have not been considered . The Republicans will vote for it , the Democrats against it ; and it will then go to the Senate . In that body , where there is no previous question and where the right of debate is unlimited , there will be thorough discussion of each separate item in the bill . Every schedule will receive consideration , and no vote will be taken until the last word has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently tedious discussion . With the power in the hand of any Senator thus to command  | attention for those matters which are of vital importance to his constituents , the adjustment of schedules becomes a matter of extreme diplomacy . Usually the Senate , having arrived at a conclusion concerning the character of the measure , insists that the House shall follow its suggestions -- an insistence which more than once has been successful . No matter what the House may do , therefore , it is not worth while to regard the new tariff as a law enacted until after the Senate has disposed of the measure . There are high protectionists in the Senate as there are in the House ; but it is reasonable to believe that they will recognize the demand for a thorough revision and agree to a law which will present a marked diminution in the schedules , certainly as respects the industries which can no longer be regarded as in the infant class . The great mass of the people want a tariff bill that shall lower , if possible , the price paid by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has money invested in manufactures or a decrease of the wages paid to the workingman . It is the reduction of the inordinate profits that will be viewed by the public without regret ; and there is no doubt that many industries which have been pampered beyond reason under the regime of a high tariff can now afford to share some of their monopolistic gains with the consumer . There does not exist in this country a general sentiment for the abolition of the protective principle , but if the abuse of this principle can be remedied in the new law a great feat in constructive legislation will have been accomplished . Once again much is being said regarding the necessity for changing the rules of the House of Representatives . It is not a new story . Representative Hepburn , of Iowa , who this year has gone down to defeat , has been strenuously urging some reform in the matter of the rules for many years . The fact that he has been leading a hopeless fight does not seem to have abated the grim determination of Representative Gardner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gardner is an aggressive member , full of fight and seeking with the ardor of youth to write for himself a name upon the wall of fame . The likelihood is that he will gain nothing more than a brief notoriety , even though he discusses the question with more than usual common sense . " If we members of the House , " he says , " continue to adopt rules abandoning our power and shifting our responsibility upon the Speaker 's shoulders we must not go back to our constituents and cry baby ' because he exercises that power , while we cheerfully leave him to bear all responsibility . This is the situation in a nutshell . It is entirely within the province  | of the members of the House to frame rules which shall deprive the Speaker of the tremendous power he now possesses . The trouble in the past , however , has been that whenever these members were brought face to face with the responsibility for adopting a new method , they have meekly surrendered , and the Speaker has continued undisturbed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets at the beginning of the next Congress some brave soul , like Mr. Gardner , till unquestionably propose a change ; but when the vote shall have been taken it will be found that the opposition will have mustered little more than a corporal 's guard . This does not mean , of course , that there is so necessity or reason for a change . It means that no one will be ready to offer a practical substitute for the present system , which will , therefore , be continued , while for the rest of the session disaffected Representatives will declaim against a condition which they refused to remedy . The present House rules had their birth in the stirring days when the late Speaker Reed , finding the House Republican by the narrowest margin , undertook to obtain a working majority by ousting Democrats against whom the merest semblance of a contest could be made . During the exciting struggle which accompanied the eliminating process , it became necessary to govern the House with a rod of iron and the Reed rules , so called , offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most arbitrary and extended power . He appointed the committees , rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies , besides which he was enabled so to frame the personnel of each committee as to make it pigeon-hole or advance legislation in accord with his own views . He named the committee on rules , which decides what matters shall or shall . not be considered by the House , and thus he was again supreme in the matter of legislation ; and , last of all , he could recognize or ignore members upon the floor exactly as he was willing or not willing to allow the member to be heard . Under this autocratic system the House has been proceeding for some years . If it is unfair or arbitrary or unwise , there is no one to blame except the members themselves ; and yet , notwithstanding all that has been said , it is very doubtful whether the insurgents can conduct a successful revolt against its readoption . No one who knows Mr. Taft will credit for a moment the statements attributed to him to the effect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to control the organization of the House . Unquestionably Mr. Taft has communicated to Mr. Cannon his views upon the tariff , this being , howenter , merely advance information , inasmuch as the same views will be  | expressed in a message to Congress at the opening of the extraordinary session . He has not undertaken to insist that Congress shall pass tariff legislation in accordance with his own views , with the threat that unless his wishes are complied with , he will exercise the right of veto , and , in the meantime , will see that a Speaker is elected who shall be subservient to his administration . Mr. Taft is an able and experienced lawyer . He knows the Constitution , and no one is better aware than he that the province of the President is purely executive , while the legislature is a co-ordinate branch of the government . Above all , he is not likely to begin his administration with a fight between himself and Congress . He is too wise and tactful . He remembers how the administration of the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Congress and the executive . Nothing could be more fatal to his peace and comfort , to say nothing of his hope of success , than to be engaged in a struggle with his own party at the Capitol . It goes without saying , therefore , that he will do nothing to invite this conflict . Congress will pursue the even tenor of its way , legislating according to the dictates of its best judgment , and Mr. Taft will afford encouragement and not throw obstacles in its way . He will emphasize his views whenever he believes they will be of value to his country and party ; but the assertion that he will overthrow Mr. Cannon and then undertake to bend the House to his supreme will is as foreign to his character and purpose as can be imagined . It seems now to be settled that Mr. Elihu Root will be the next Senator from the State of New York . The Empire State could not do a wiser or a better thing . Mr. Root is to-day one of the ablest men in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , developing in that position an instinct for diplomacy , in its broadest and best sense , such as has not been witnessed for generations . His latest achievement , the agreement with Japan , brings to a fitting climax an official career which has merited national appreciation . In the Senate Mr. Root will be a tower of strength to the Republican Party . He is a forceful and convincing speaker , and he is thoroughly acquainted with every phase of law , national and international . His ability , dignity , experience and great knowledge will combine to give him prominence ; and while New York may honor him , none the less will he honor the State of New York .
