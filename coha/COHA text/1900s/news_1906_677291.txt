txt There has been much talk lately about the defeats that President Roosevelt has met with in his attempts to direct legislation . To balance the account no President has ever bad such complete and astounding success in trying to put legislation through as Mr. Roosevelt won yesterday in the adoption by the Senate of the Meat Inspection bill as a rider on the Agricultural Appropriation bill . It bids fair to be a nine days ' wonder in Washington . The bill did not exist until this week . It had never been considered . Tet it went through the Senate with a rush . and the man who did it was Theodore Roosevelt . He did it by taking the packers by the throat . They were held up and told : " Either this thing becomes a law or I will publish the report of Neill and Reynolds and expose the conditions under which you do business . The report made by Charles P. Neill , Commissioner of the Labor Bureau , and James B. Reynolds . Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , exists only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , but Neill and Reynolds stand ready at any time to write it down in full , and if they do - it will show conditions to be more revolting than Upton Sinclair 's novel showed them to be . The abstract was read to-day to Senator Cullom , and afterward he said that no man could properly oppose the Beveridge bill . It may appear strange that such a report should not have been written , but it Is to be remembered that Neill and Reyn ( aids did not investigate in any official Capacity . The President Was Indignant . The President did not send Neill and Reynolds forth merely on the statements made by Upton Sinclair in his novel , " The Jungle . " After he had been convinced of the truth of Sinclair 's statements he manifested such an interest in the question that other people brought statements to him . He read the proofs of articles on the subject , and everything he read increased his anger . He then asked his two friends to look into the matter , and let him know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look Into it , and told him that everything he had learned was correct . Immediately upon this , filled with indignation , the President had Senator Beveridge introduce the Meat Inspection bill , and then served notice that unless It was passed in jig time the report would be made public . Nobody concerned asked to see the report . Nobody asked whether it was even written . They simply fell over themselves to withdraw all opposition and to beg the President not to make it public . A hard-and-fast bargain was made between the President and the packers . What he wanted was to put an end to the frightful condition of affairs revealed to him , and to do it right away . He did not intend to have any shilly-shallying as there was about the Rate bill . He had the cards , and was ready and anxious to play them . The packers heard about his position early , and have been dancing around in a frantic condition for two days . Their one desire was to keep the report from the public . W. E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday found out on what terms the President would withhold the report . /t was on condition that the Beveridge bill be passed that day . When Skinner found that there was simply nothing else to be done , and that Lhe time was so short , he hurriedly consulted the other agents of the packers , and the agreement was made with - the President that the packers would unite with him ! n pushing the bill through on condition that the public should not ! get the information in the bands of the President Packers Hurried the Bill . Then the packers learned that the report had not been written . but that Neill had receivea orders to get it into documentary form at once and have it ready in the shortest possible space of time . They consulted their Congressional friends , and one Congressman went to see the President . Re came back and rtported that if the packers were to save themselves the agreement with the President must be carried out within a few hours . Senator Carter of Montana is the especial champion of the live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and asked him to rush the bill through in some form , it dtd , not matter what . Carter hustled around and got hold of Beveridge , and the two arranged that it should be tacked on to the Agricultural Appropriation bill , which had the right of way in the Senate . It was done . There - Vas no attempt at debate ; the situation was too serious . Eerybody , friends and enemies of the packers alike , Joined forces and Jammed it through . To-day the packers have shown a disposition , not exactly to back out of their agreement , but to see if they can not induce the President to weaken . They sent Senator Cullom , Speaker Cannon , and Representatives Madden and Lorimer of Chicago to see the President . These four statesmen presented the arguments of their constituents and tried to call off Mr. Roosevelt . In justice to Senator Cullom it should be explained that he simply went to thel President because the packers are his constituents , and he felt obliged to lay their views before him . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although Lorimer is known to be outspokenly against the measure . The President utterly refused to be cajoled . He told the delegation that he stood pat on his agreement with the packers , and they could rest assured that unless the bill became a law Neill would have some writing to do and the newspapers woud have something to print . Senator Beveridge called at the White Rouse , too , and came away highly satis // BEEF TRUST BEATEN , BUT ESCAPES EXPOSURE // fled with the President 's attitude . He is also tickled with his measure . " The bill , " said he , " does not change She existing laws as to the careful inspection of meats for export to other countries . It simply provides that the American shall know that he is getting as good meat as the foreigner , who has heretofore been well protected under our inspection laws . Our home people are about as good as those abroad , It seems to me , and are entitled to some consideration ... What the packers are fighting for now is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was laid before the President to-day , but he would not hear of It . More representatives of the packers are on their way to Washington , and a lobby will be established by Monday . Speaker Cannon is the main reliance of the packers now . . As the amendment carries an appropriation , the Speaker intends to have it referred to the Agricultural Committee . That will give the packers a breathing spell , and is strictly in accordance with the rules .
