 | " When commercial intercourse is thus refused its usual direct roads , it seeks a new path , by the most circuitous course , with all the persistency of a natural force . The supply will work its way to the demand , though in diminished volume , through all the obstacles interposed by man . Even the contracted lines about a beleaguered city will thus be pierced by the ingenuity of the trader seeking gain ; but when the blockade is extended over a long frontier , total exclusion becomes hopeless . " ? Mahan , The Influence of Sea Power upon the French Revolution and Empire , vol. 1 , p. 877 . BLOCKADE RUNNING . For several months after the secession of Alabama , its one important seaport ? Mobile ? was open and export and import trade went on as usual . The proclamation of Lincoln , April 19 , 1861 , practically declared a blockade of the ports of the Southern States . A vessel attempting to enter or to leave was to be warned , and , if a second attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prize . By proclamations of April 27 and August 16 , 1861 , the blockade was extended and made more stringent . All vessels and cargoes belonging to citizens of the Southern States found at sea or in a port of the United States were to be confiscated . As the summer advanced the blockade was made more and more effective until finally , at the end of 1861 , the port of Mobile was closed to all but the professional blockade runners . The fact that the legislature in the fall of 1861 was fostering various new industries and purchasing certain articles of common use shows that the effects of the blockade were beginning to be felt .  | At first the general confidence in the power of King Cotton made most Southern people desire to let the blockade assist the work of war , and , by creating a scarcity of cotton abroad , cause foreign governments to recognize the Confederate government and raise the blockade. * The pinch of want soon made many forget their faith in the power of cotton ; there was a general desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange . The State administration was distinctly in favor of blockade running and foreign tradet . In 1861 , the legislature incorporated two " Direct Trading Companies , " giving them permission to own and sail ships between the ports of the State and the ports of foreign countries for the purpose of carrying on trade. ; The general regulation of foreign commerce , however , fell to the Confederate government which was distinctly opposed to all blockade running not under its immediate control and supervision . The State authorities complained that the course of the Confederate administration was harsh and unnecessary . The State was willing to prohibit blockade running on private account , but insisted that its public vessels be allowed to import supplies needed by the State . The complaint about restrictions on trade was general throughout the Southern States and , in October , 1864 , the Southern governors in a meeting in Augusta , Georgia , Governor Watts , of Alabama , taking a leading part , declared that each State had the right to export its productions  | and import such supplies as might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State troops in the army , State vessels being used for this purpose . The governors united in a request to Congress to remove the restrictions on such trade . But the Confederate administration to the last retained control of foreign trade . Agents were sent abroad by the Treasury and War Departmentst who were instructed to send on vessels attempting to run the blockade , first , arms and ammunition ; second , clothing , boots , shoes , and hats ; third , drugs and chemicals that were most needed , such as quinine , chloroform , ether , opium , morphine , and rhubarb . These agents were instructed to see that all vessels leaving for Southern ports were laden with the articles named . Such part of the cargoes as was not taken by the government was sold at auction to the highest bidder . These blockade auction sales were attended by merchants from the inland towns , whose shelves were almost bare of goods during three years of the wart . For two years military and naval supplies were the most important articles brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of all kinds of war equipment , and the State administration made every effort to obtain military supplies from abroad . Shipments of arms from Europe were made to the West Indies , generally to Cuba , and thence smuggled into Mobile and other Gulf ports . The shipments were always long delayed while waiting for a favorable opportunity to attempt a run . A large proportion of the blockade runners making for Mobile were captured by the United States vessels. ; Dark nights and rainy , stormy weather furnished the opportunity to the runners to slip into or out of a port . Once at sea ,  | nothing could catch them , since they were built for fast sailing rather than for capacity to carry freight . Most of the arms secured by Alabama came by way of Cuba , as did nearly all the supplies that entered the port of Mobile , or were smuggled in on boats along the coast . Havana was 590 miles from Mobile , and between these ports most of the blockade trade of the Gulf Coast was carried on . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of condemned Spanish flintlock muskets which were remodelled and repaired and placed in the hands of the State troops . Machinery for the naval foundry and arsenal at Selma and for the navy yard on the Tombigbee was brought through the blockade from England via the West Indies . The Confederate government besides taking its own half of each cargo had the first choice of all other goods brought through the blockade and usually chose shoes , clothing , and medicine . The State could only make contracts for the importation of supplies ; it could not import them on its own vessels . The Confederate government paid high prices for goods , but on the whole paid much less than did the private individual for the remainder of the cargo when sold at auction . The merchants made large profits on the few articles of merchandise secured by them . Speculators bought up lots of merchandise at Mobile and carried them far inland to the small towns and villages of the Black Belt and further North and secured fabulous prices in Confederate money for ordinary calico , shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State was more completely shut from the outside world than any other section of the South . The Federal lines touched the northern part of the State , but the traffic carried on through the lines seldom reached the central counties . Consequently , the arrival of a merchant in the Black Belt village with a small lot blockade calicoes , shoes , hats , scented soap , etc. , was  | a great event and people came from far and near to gaze upon the fine things exhibited in the usually empty show windows . Few had sufficient Confederate money to buy the commonest articles , but some one could always be found to purchase the latest useless trifle that came from abroad. * In exchange for goods thus imported the blockade runners carried out cargoes of cotton . As has been stated the Confederate administration was in charge of cotton exportation . The Confederate treasury department purchased in Alabama 134,252 bales of cotton for $13,633,621.90 ? that is , $101.55 a bale . This cotton was to be sold abroad for the benefit of the Confederate government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great producing States of Alabama , Mississippi and Louisiana . Alabama furnished more than any other State . In 1864 , 3,226 bales of cotton were shipped from Mobile by the Treasury Department and the proceeds applied to the support of the Erlanger Loan . To avoid competition between the departments of the government , it was agreed , June 1 , 1864 , that all stores for shipment should be turned over to the Treasury , transported to the vessels by the War Department , and consigned to Treasury agents in the West Indies , or in Europe . It was to be sold finally by the Treasury agent at Liverpool and the proceeds placed to the credit of the Treasury . The export business was under the direction of the Produce Loan Office which had charge of all government cotton and tobacco . Contracts were usually made with companies to whom the government turned over the cotton for shipment . In November , 1864 , there were 115,450 bales of government cotton in Alabama , 18,802 bales having been sold . It is hardly possible that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . f It was found very difficult to secure bagging and ties sufficient to bale the cotton for shipping . It is not likely that after all the State gained much by trade through the blockade . The risks were great and the exporters had to have a large share of the profit , but arms , medicine , and  | blankets , were valuable and very necessary . In spite of regulations , the blockade runners brought in more luxuries than necessaries , causing much extravagance , and there were people who objected to the practice altogether . In March , 1863 , the Mobile Committee of Safety reported that there were several vessels then in the harbor fitting out to carry cotton to Cuba . They were of the opinion that the government ought not to allow them to depart , since the country could not afford to lose the vessels with their machinery which could not be replaced . Governor Shorter agreed with them and a protest was made to the Richmond authorities , but the vessels went out . judge Dargan , whom many things troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ruining the country by supplying the enemy with cotton and bringing in return useless gewgaws . From March 1 , 1864 , to the end of the war , the Confederate government succeeded better in regulating the imports by blockade runners . But after August , when Farragut captured the forts defending the harbor entrance , the port of Mobile received little from the outside world . Before the stringent regulations of the Confederacy went into force , blockade running was demoralized . The importers refused to accept paper money for their goods and thus discredited currency while draining specie from the country . High prices and extortion followed . Cotton , instead of being exchanged for British gold , brought in trinkets , silks , satins , laces , broadcloth , brandy , rum , whiskey , fancy slippers , and ladies ' goods generally . Curious enough , there was great demand for these in spite of the wants of the necessaries of life , medicine , and munitions of war . Delicate women , old persons , and children suffered most from the effect of the blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the South because the blockade kept out necessary medicines The blockade reduced the Confederacy ; the Union navy rather than the Union army was the prime factor in crushing the South ; it made possible the victories of the army . As it was , the blockade runners probably postponed the end of the war a year or more . Though the number of blockade runners increased in the latter  | part of 1864 and in 1865 , Alabama profited but little ; her one good sea port was closed in August , 1864 , by Farragut 's fleet , and with the fleet came the last regular blockade runner . As the warships were moving up to engage the forts , a blockade runner passed in with them , unnoticed . TRADE THROUGH THE LINES . The early policy of the Confederate administration was to bring the North to terms by shutting off the cotton supply and by ceasing to purchase supplies which had heretofore been a sourch of great profit to Northern merchants , and was , on the whole , consistently adhered to during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its people were destitute ; then it was ready to relax restrictions on trade . Individuals who had plenty of cotton and little to eat and wear soon came to the conclusion that traffic with the North would do no harm , but much good . The United States wanted the products of the South and made stronger efforts to get them than the blockaded South made to get supplies by the exchange . Until the very last the North was more active in the commercial intercourse than the South , notwithstanding the fearful want all over the Southern country . The policy of the North was to have all trade in Southern products pass through the hands of its own treasury agents who were to strip such products of all extraordinary profits for the benefit of the United States Treasury , and to see that the Confederacy profited as little as possible . The Con- federate States government , when forced to allow some kind of trade through the lines , sought to sell only government cotton or to force traders to traffic under its license . The State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederate license in order to get supplies for the destitute in the counties near the lines of the enemy . Few regulations of commercial intercourse were made by the Confederate States , but many were made by the United States . The Confederate States had the problem almost under control ; the United States did not and had to try to regulate what it could not prohibit . An outline of the United States regulations is necessary to an understanding of the conditions along the Confederate frontier from 1864 to 1865 : The proclamation of the president , April 19 , 1861 , declaring a blockade of the Southern ports , did not effect commercial intercourse by land between the States . An act of Congress , July 13 , 1861 , authorized the president to prohibit commercial intercourse with the Southern States except such as might be done under license and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury . A proclamation of August 19 , 1861 , directed the enforcement of the provisions of this act , and licenses were issued by the Secretary of the Treasury . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 31 , 1863 ) , provided for a licensed trade under the Secretary of the Treasury who , on March 4 , 1872 , issued rules and regulations requiring bond to be made by the trader and a stringent registry of all goods to be kept . A fee of one-half of one per cent . on the value of the goods was charged for each permit . The custom officials in the inland towns were instructed , March 29 , 1862 , to facilitate this licensed commerce . Regulations of August 28 , 1862 , provided that in no case should gold or silver be paid for Confederate products . Officials , called " aids to the revenue , " were placed on the border trade routes to see that traffic went on according to prescribed rules . Officials were authorized to seize merchandise which ought not to go to the Confederates . Only loyal citizens were to engage in this trade . The war and navy departments instructed army and navy officers to give assistance to those engaged in licensed trade . March 31 , 1863 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills of exchange should , under any circumstances ,  | be paid for Confederate products . " Supervising agents " and " Boards of Trade , " appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury , were to see that the regulations were carried out . Directions from the war and navy departments forbade any officer to have any interest in licensed trade or to authorize on his own responsibility any trade in Confederate products . They were , however , to give assistance to licensed traders in the way of transportation and protection . A proclamation of April 2 , 1863 , directed the confiscation of all merchandise from Southern States unless licensed . To this time the various orders , rules , and regulations were rather indefinite as to how far the trading might extend , whether within the Confederate lines or not . The question seems to have been avoided and , as a matter of fact , the traders went within Confederate territory . But a circular of July 3 , 1863 , from the Secretary of the Treasury stated that while the freest possible intercourse was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no supplies must be allowed to go to persons within Confederate lines ; no trade beyond the Union lines was to be allowed ; across the Confederate lines there could be no commercial intercourse . This , it was said , had been the general policy . ( If so , it had not been so stated . ) There was not so much danger , he said , in purchasing Confederate produce as in selling supplies which were likely to go to the enemy . Trade regulations of September 11 , 1863 , divided the Southern States into agencies numbered from one to seven , under the control of a supervising special agent of the treasury . Alabama was included in the first and fifth agencies . A " trade district " was territory in an agency not firmly under the control of the Union arms , but rather on the borderland between the two countries . Here trade was limited to supplying the inhabitants with the necessaries of life . No permit was to be given for trade within the Confederate lines . These and nearly all other regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederate lines and bring out goods , but it is quite evident from the evasive language that it was intended to be done . The precautions taken to prevent supplies and coin or bullion from being paid for the Southern produce show that it was expected that the Confederacy would furnish the merchandise . The regulations of January 26 , 1864 , provided that any resi- page deleted  | was established in Southern Alabama . A proclamation of May 23 , 1865 , removed restrictions upon the amount of trade , but the twenty-five per cent . tax on cotton purchases , the internal revenue tax , and the fees for transportation permits were still imposed . A treasury regulation made it possible for any one to sell his cotton , provided he had made it by his own labor or by the labor of hired freedmen or whites . This kept the slave-holder , who produced most of the cotton , from profiting by the cessation of hostilities . A proclamation of June 13 , 1865 , ordered that after June 30 all restrictions on trade ( except contraband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contraband might be admitted on license , and the former commercial relations were resumed , but not until all the cotton produced during the war had either been confiscated or had paid the enormous taxes imposed by the regulations . The legislation of the Confederate States was not so full , but the policy was about the same and more consistly enforced . In 1862 , the Confederate Congress made it unlawful to sell in any part of the Confederate States in possession of the enemy any cotton , tobacco , rice , sugar , molasses , or naval storest . Licenses , however , for the sale of certain merchandise could be obtained from the Secretary of War . Trade through the lines was not under the supervision of treasury officials but was looked after by the generals commanding the frontier . In 1864 , a law of Congress prohibited the export of military and naval stores , and agricultural products , such as cotton and tobacco , except under regulations prescribed by the president .  | But the restrictions were not strictly enforced . It was not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the war The people of Alabama , were , on the whole , disposed to approve the policy of the Confederate authorities , but , when want and destitution came , the owners of cotton proceeded to find a way to sell a few bales . Early in 1863 , north Alabama was occupied by the Federals and trade began along the line of the Tennessee river . Later , there were trade lines to the northwest through Mississippi , and to the northeast through Georgia and Tennessee . After the capture of New Orleans , cotton was sent through Mississippi to New Orleans , or to the banks of the Mississippi river , and always found purchasers . There was a thriving trade between Mobile and New Orleans during the Butler regime in the latter city . By the trade through the lines the people of Alabama secured more of the scarcer commodities than by the blockade running . Much of the trade was carried on by firms in Mobile that had agents or branch houses in New Orleans . Three pounds of cotton were exchanged for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medical stores were secured in exchange for cotton ; salt was also a commodity much in demand . For three years , from 1862 to 1864 , trade was quite brisk between the two cities , some of it under license by the Confederate Secretary of War and some of it purely contraband . As long as Butler controlled New Orleans there was no troubles . Whoni General Canby went to New Orleans , he reported that English houses in Mobile were making contracts to export 200,000 bales of cotton via New Orleans , and expected to realize $10,000,000 net profits . Canby was of the opinion that the cotton trade aided the Confederates.  | The character of the treasury agents in charge of the cotton trade was bad ; they were likely to do anything for gain . He stated on the authority of a New Orleans banker , who was the agent of a cotton speculator , that Confederate agents would come to New Orleans with United States legal tender notes and invest in sterling with him , drawing against cotton which was ostensibly purchased from " loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Confederates with regard to the movements of the Federals , in order that the Confederates might preserve cotton that would in an emergency be destroyed . The speculators would buy the cotton later . In 1864 , a New York manufacturer testified that he had made contracts with firms in Selma , Montgomery , and Mobile to take pay for debts due him in cotton delivered through the lines at New Orleans . The price was $1.24 to $1.30 a pound in New York . Treasury agents made similar contracts for Alabama cotton to be delivered through New Orleans , Pensacola , or through the lines in Mississippi , Tennessee , and Georgia . One agent , H. A. Risley , made contracts with half a dozen persons for more than 350,000 bales of cotton , the bulk of which was to come from Alabama . Most of this , it is needless to say , was not delivered.t The Confederate officials tried to manage that only government cotton went out under the licenses from the War Department and that only necessary supplies were imported in exchange . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smuggling of cotton in 1864 , through the Mississippi to New Orleans and the river , and on September 22 , 1864 , General Dick Taylor ( at Selma ) annulled all cotton export contracts in the department of Alabama , Mississippi , and east Louisiana . However , he said . the Confederate authorities would purchase necessaries imported and would pay for them in cotton at fifty cents a pound . This cotton could then be carried beyond the lines . No luxuries were to be imported under penalty of confiscation . Surgeon Potts , of the Confederate army , stationed at Montgomery , secured medical supplies from the Federal lines in Louis- page deleted  | It was alleged that he used United States transportation to haul cotton when the transportation was needed for other purposes . Mitchell claimed that personally he had received no profit from his trade ; it appeared , however , that he had used his official position to advance the interests of his brother-in-law and his son-in-law . The discussion over his case brought out the fact that the northern cotton speculator or agent would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eleven cents a pound , Confederate currency , * and take the cotton North and realize immense profits . Mitchell and other Federal officers , it was shown , approved and assisted the trade beyond the lines . Individual permits were sometimes given by President Lincoln authorizing the bearers to go within the Confederacy , without restriction , and get cotton , and other Southern produce . Sometimes , after bringing it out , these people lost their cotton to United States treasury agents , because the permission given by the president was not in accordance with the treasury regulations . In north Alabama several agents got into trouble in this way . Lincoln , it seems , understood that the laws gave him authority to issue permits to trade within the Confederate lines . In 1864 , when cotton was selling at forty to fifty cents a pound in coin , numbers of Federal officers resigned in order to speculate in cotton . A former beef contractor who had grown rich in the cotton trade was said to have controlled almost the whole of Huntsville . Both hotels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and there was complaint of his extortions ? . Small packages , especially of quinine , were sent South through through the Adams Express Company , which would guarantee to deliver them within the Confederacy . This caused speculation and it was finally stopped . Women passed through the lines and brought back quinine and other medicines concealed in their  | page deleted  | Much of the trade was carried on by poor people who had a few bales of cotton and who were obliged to sell it or suffer from want . This fact caused the Confederate officers to be lax in the enforcement of the regulations . The extraordinary prices of cotton in the outside world brought little gain to the blockaded Confederacy . Before the cotton could be brought into the Union lines or beyond the blockade , all the profits had been absorbed by the Confederate speculator , or , most often , by the Union speculators and treasury agents . Theoretically , the regulations of the United States should have brought much profit to the Federal government . In fact , as Secretary Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal from Confederate staples brought into the Union lines . These frauds and the demoralizing effects of the system were evidenced by many reports from officers of the army and navy . t But in spite of the demoralizing effects of the contraband trade within the Confederacy and in spite of the extremely low prices obtained for Confederate staples , much needed supplies were sent in in such quantities as to enable the contest to be maintained much longer than otherwise it would have lasted .
