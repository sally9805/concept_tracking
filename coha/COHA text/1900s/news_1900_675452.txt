txt The report is heard here to-night , as coming from Boston , that in reply to a letter sent to Capt . F. E. Chadwick , United States Navy , by Secretary Long , regarding the authorship of certain cr1t - isms of Rear Admiral Schley printed recently and attributed to Capt . Chadwick , the Captain admitted to the Secretary ' that he did make statements substantially like those referred to in the letter of inquiry . In the interview said to have been given by Capt . Chadwick , he is reported to have said that " Every one of us feels the disgrace that Schley has put upon us . " He also spoke of Schley as having been " guilty of a disgraceful exhibition of pettiness , " declared that he held Schley In contempt , and called upon the Rear Admiral to ask for a court of inquiry to obtain a vidication if he thought his course deserved Investigation . This interview created great surprise at the Navy Department , not because it did not please many officers , but because if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? would get Capt . Chadwick into trouble . The first view taken by some of the men who sympathize with Capt . Chadwick in disliking Schley , was that if the words attracted official attention , they Might lead to a court-martial , which would bring out all the incidents considered by Sehley 's foes to be discreditable to him , and perhaifs injure his standing in the navy . On the other hand , the friends of Rear Admiral Schley say that it does not make any difference what Capt . Chadwick intended to do , or what his opinion Is of Rear Admiral Schley , or whether what he says is true or false , or part true and part false . " At all events , " said one of Schley 's friends , who is acquainted with the navy regulations and the customs of the service , " Capt . Chadwick knows that he can not , with impunity , pass upon matters already determined by his superior officers without subjecting himself to trial for several breaches of the regulations . " No matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chadwick , he was complimented by the President and proposed for promotion for conspicuous conduct in batte . He has been advanced to next to the highest grade since he fought in the battle of Santiago , and after all the circumstances were known for which he has since been assailed by Capt . Chadwick and others . For contemptuous words spoken of a superior officer , Chadwick may be called to trial . " If It is the expectation that a trial will bring out all the incidents of the Sampson-Schley controversy , somebody will be mistaken . According to my experience , all . that will . bedorm. , will be to ascertain whether the derogatory wards were spoken for publication or for repetition . It will not make a particle of difference whether Chadwick thought they were true . It will be enough to prove by himself or others that he said the words . " You will recall the case of a Chaplain recently tried for using disrespectful language concerning his commanding officer . It was found that he had used the language . It was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out whether what he said was true . That was quite immaterial . For his disrespectful language , subversive of good order and discipline , and for drunkenness , he was dismissed from the service . " Some years ago an Admiral in the service under a former Secretary of the Navy made use of disrespectful language toward the Secretary , and the attention of the Admiral was directed to the language published in a newspaper . He was asked if he had used the language . He ' stood mute , ' declining to say anything . He might have declared that he did not use the language , or he might , have admitted that he used it . In the latter case he would have been tried . not to ascertain whether his opinion of the Secretary was justified , but to - rove that he did employ the disrespectful language . " Rear Admiral Schley is at Bahia in command of his station . He undoubtedly knows that Capt . Chadwick is not friendly to him , but he can not know for some time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes the defender of the service at large in such cases , if his attention is directed to language which is forbidden by the regulations , which it is contended Chadwick 's language is . There is no doubt among Schley 's friends that if Schley had used such language to a reporter for publication touching Rear Admiral Sampson . if the latter were absent in South America . Secretary Long would promptly require Schley to answer , not to justify his remarks but to say whether he had made them or not . Capt . Chadwick is the officer on whose account Rear Admiral Sampson last Summer made the assertion that it was in consequence of a letter written by Chadwick for Gen. Shafter , in which he called upon Gen. Toral to surrender Santiago , that the Spanish commander surrendered , and not because of the punishment inflicted by Shafter and the arrival , five days after the letter was sent , of Major Gen. Miles with reinforcements . Shafter 's comment on this was merely " bosh. "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
