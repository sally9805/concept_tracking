- The official list of contributors to the Republican campaign fund contains few surprises . Preliminary " leaking " had given the public a pretty shrewd idea of its actual contents . It will be well to keep certain of the names handy , when it comes to " claims " upon the new administration , diplomatic or otherwise . Some of the Pennsylvania givers may reasonably be supposed-to have been grateful in anticipation of tariff favors to come ; but that was to be expected . The largest donors , including Mr. Taft 's brother , were practically known in advance A discerning eye will perceive something like a rounding up of the diplomatic corps , many of whom came down handsomely Ambassador Hill 's contribution of $2,000 may have been intended to prove to the German Emperor that he was not so poor a man as had been represented . The total sum is about what was believed . The $5,000 , - 000 campaign which Chairman Hitchcock thought necessary to plan in the beginning , came down to about $1,700,000 , and that amount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample That is one lesson of great value to be learned from this new publicity . The country knows now that such vast campaign funds as Mark Hanna raised , and as Mr. Roosevelt had four years ago , imply either waste or corruption , or both . We see that a President can be elected for one-third the money which was said to be needful for " legitimate expenses . " Another lesson is that no harm would have been done by frank publication of these contributions before the election . Hereafter , that course ought to be pursued voluntarily by the national committees , even if it is not compelled by law . So far as one can see now , there is no greater scandal attaching to the receipt of any of these Republican contributions than there was to some of the Democratic There is visible distress among the " friends of the tariff " over the way in which the whole question of revision has been thrown open . They now see themselves faced by free and full debate . This was the last thing on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not endure . What they had in-mind was tariff-revision under a blanket . Perfunctory , hearings were to be held , in which each man with a claim on the party would take the bill and sit- down , quickly and write whatever rate . of increase he might like . Then the power of- the Republican- or-ganization in Congress was to be used to shut off discussion , and to put through ' the measure . These nicely laid plans ' have already gone agley . It is now clear that something like an irrepressible conflict over the tariff is before Congress . Public interest is keenly aroused The spectacle of men calmly asking that the taxing power of the government be put at - their service , to increase their profits , no longer passes as a matter of course , an entirely innocent proceeding People are now Shocked by it Ugly words are applied , such as the " thieves " and " hogs " of Charles Francis Adams . Mr. Taft asked li:s innocent question , " Where are the consumers ? " Mr. Carnegie fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been to make an end of the projected juggling and secret-revision of - the tariff It is plain now that the work has got to be done in the open , that manufacturers will not be permitted to go at midnight to write their own schedules , as they did in the McKinley and the Dingley bills , and that the entire subject is up for thorough investigation and resettlement . No tariff-reformer can ask for a better opportunity than this prospect furnishes . As we said repeatedly during the campaign , such publicity and searching inquiry about the ? tariff are the first requisites . For eleven years , debate on the matter has been stifled in Congress . Ncit even the most reasonable and urgent proposal to correct acknowledged absurdities or inequalities in the Dingley bill , could be got out of the morgue of the Ways and Means Committee But the protectionists are now on the defensive , and will be forced to explain and justify , in the open court of reason , every one of their little schemes to make the country rich by taxing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he has gone about the business of keeping the pledges which he made in the name of his party . These were regarded by the " standpatters " as only a campaign trick . Since the election , they have been even denying that any promise was made . - The Boston Advertiser having remarked that the new President had promised that there should be " many reductions " in the tariff- - rates ; the-Am-mean Economist , which stands for the highest , blindest , and greediest protection , rejoined in its issue of November 20 . We do not understand that Mr Taft has made any such promise . There is a marked difference between the vague opinion that some of the tariff schedules might properly be reduced and a promise thalt the schedules shall be reduced Not having any power to execute it , Mr. Taft would not be likely to make that promise As President he may , if he Chooses , recommend tariff reduction , but he can not reduce the tariff Congress alone can do that . With talk of that kind in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honest man , has taken occasion to say that he means to be honest about the tariff . He said this in ' Washington , early last week , and he said it again through Mr. Burton last Sunday , when he intimated that he should not hesitate to oppose Speaker Cannon if necessary , in order to carry out the solemn pledge of the party to make a thorough and honest revision of the tariff . Current press dispatches report-that in all likelihood a treaty referring to The Hague court of arbitration all questions affecting the Newfoundland fisheries , will be laid before the Senate at its - coming session . This would be an admirable way of settling once and for all certain vexing problems wh ! ch , like those arising from the tariff , have caused much friction between the two countries . The removal of these grievances would also dispose the Canadians to take fresh interest in proposals from our side to reduce duties on Canadian products . Both their political parties have become advocates of protection . But Sir Wilfrid Laurier has long favored a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute . Now that he has entered upon his final term as Prime Minister , he might well desire to crown his career with so brilliant a diplomatic achievement . Certainly , Mr. Taft , during his Presidency , could do nothing more useful than to join Canada and the United States by new and far-reaching reciprocity. treaties . Free trade between the countries would benefit the whole world by assuring peace between two great neighbors , and by showing how artificial lines  --  may be gradually broken down . Herein lies the greatest value of free trade , and the firmest ground for hope that , despite reverses and defeats , the cause still marches on . Mr. Bryan 's defiant announcement that he will run again for the Presidency in 1912 , if " circumstances " once more " force " him into the campaign , removes the last reason for not proceeding forthwith to wrest control of the Democratic organization from his hands . There has been a laudable feeling that one should not be too hard on a man when he is down . Even those most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other managers have wished to go about the work of reorganizing the party with due consideration of Mr. Bryan 's sensibilities . But apparently he has none . Everybody knows what he means when he says " circumstances " He means retaining mastery of the party machinery . That was the one circumstance which forced assent to his candidacy this year from the reluctant Southern States . Steps ought at once to be taken by self-respecting Democratic leaders in the South to make it clear , even to his complacency , that he can never have that support again . There are limits to the posturing of even organized labor . At Denver , last week , the report of the committee of the Federation of Labor advocated entire disobedience to court injunctions , with an heroic going to jail rather than submitting But this was too fantastic for the convention , which voted down that part of the report , three to one Consequently , it will be left to the individual to decide whether he will give heed to the orders of a judge , or be committed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court , being the law of the land , there is no reason why the Federation of Labor , if it resolved to " disregard " injunctions , should not also proclaim its intention of disregarding the laws against assault and battery . But now that the election is over , the sensible view was taken by the majority of the Federation . Hence a labor leader may hereafter refuse to make a martyr or a fool of himself , without danger of being called a " scab . " If adopted just to avoid the appearance of charity , the Carnegie Foundation 's plan to pension college teachers without regard to their private means seems hardly necessary . Only a few hypersensitive souls insist upon viewing the endowment as a poor-fund . Everybody else perceives that there is no difference whatever between money given to a college for a chair in physics and money given for a retiring allowance to a professor of physics . The man who accepts as salary the interest on the first sum is just as much and just as little an object of charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for humiliation than the well-to-do lawyer who secures $5,000 worth of education for his son at a cost of $600 in tuition fees . The college professor has earned his pension by hard work ; it is only deferred salary . If he can not accept it as such , consistency will force him to resign at once ; for all his academic earnings are equally tainted with benevolence . A new revolution in Hayti will supply Nord Alexis with another chance within less than a year to show that age can not wither nor custom stale his fine tropic ferocity . This latest uprising , headed by President Alexis 's own military commander in the south of the island , would seem to have been provoked by the action of the PreSident himself when he summoned Gen. Simon to Port-au-Prince for a conference on political conditions . Gen. Simon interpreted the invitation as given in the same spirit that animated Alexander VI when he invited a rich cardinal or two to dinner . Gen. Simon refused to come to Port-au-Prince , and has been declared a rebel . Yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President . Nord Alexis is over eighty , and since his death would surely be followed by a scramble for the vacant place , a prudent politician and military man might well lay his plans accordingly . When an English field marshal catches infection his temperature rises just as if he were an ordinary American naval captain or Congressman . Lord Roberts and Richmond Pearson Hobson  --  it is amazing how the virus of foreign invasion developS the same symptoms in both . Japan grows and adds to her war-strength ; obviously she aims at us . Germany is growing and building warships ; obviously , she aims at England . Germany has ships with a carrying capacity of 200,000 men " always available in her northern ports , " and can gather 200,000 men in the region about her nearest harbor " without trouble . " Moreover , Lord Roberts tells his countrymen about the eighty thousand Germans in England , corresponding to Hobson 's twenty thousand Japanese in San Francisco , who upon the outbreak of war are sure to pour a dreadful backfire into Britain 's serried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind will be delivered ? The German waiters in London will at once begin to serve underdone chops , and so impair the military efficiency of British heroes . German book-stall attendants will force unon their customers the works of Plato and John Locke and sickly o'er their resolution with the pale cast of thought . German tailors will supply British cavalry regiments with uncomfortable riding breeches . That so fine a soldier as Lord Roberts should not think of checking up his views by the history of war in the past , only shows how far from common sense a man will wander in pursuit of a hobby When , in recent years , has a nation at war received the slightest military cooperation from its subjects resident within the borders of the enemy ? One would imagine that our own civil war would have offered such an opportunity . There were in the North tens of thousands who favored the cause of the Confederacy . Yet in spite of vast rumored conspiracies , military assaults , and burnings , no hostile Southern force attacked the Union armies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cities were burned , no treasuries were looted . This whole method of war by conspiracy is the invention of the imaginative novelists who have recently been waging fearful wars all over the world  --  for the magazines  --  and making and unmaking empires Yet against the dreadful eighty thousand German waiters , tailors , and clerks , reinforced by their sixty million brethren beyond the seas , Lord Roberts calls for a citizen army of a million men . It is true that only three years ago a committee of defence under Mr. Balfour examined the subject thoroughly and pronounced the fear of invasion nonsense . Things have changed during the last three Years , argue the chills-and-fever school of British politicians . Yet what has changed ; Britain 's engirdling seas are still there Her fleet is still there . If it 's her nerves that are giving way , these same politicians are directly responsible for it It is pleasant to turn from armies of a million men and billion-dollar navies to vast amounts of money and large multitudes dealt with in the interests of labor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $900,000,000 to carry into full effect the scheme for transferring the soil of Ireland to its cultivators nearly doubles the expenditure foreseen by the authors of the Irish Land Act of 1903 . What has been accomplished so far under that act ? The champions of war and destruction move forward to the blare of the trumpet . The regeneration of a country 's economic life proceeds in humble , humdrum fashion . Mr. Birrell 's statement that $125,000,000 has already been expended under the act of 1903 , and that loans to the amount of $260,000,000 are under negotiation , is not so illuminating as the record of the actual increase in the . number of individual Irish land holdings . From 1890 to 1904 the number of occupiers increased only by 21,000 , reaching a total of 545,000 in the latter year . From about the beginning of 1904 to March 31 , 1907 , a little over three years , there were sold by the Estates Commissioners 4,444 estates to 111,972 purchasers . Allowing for the fact that some of the purchasers were already the possessors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee-holders is apparent When Campbell-Bannerman surrendered the Premiership to Herbert Asquith , there came any number of predictions regarding the inevitable dissolution of the Liberal majority , due to take place within anywhere from three months to two years . Campbell-Bannerman 's personality alone held the Liberals togeth er ; with him gone , etc But Mr. Asquith has shown that a party may be held together by something else than the gracious qualities of its leader ; and those other means are aggressive leadership , tactical skill , and , above all , getting one 's party on the right side of broad moral issues . The Liberal government has already placed some notable pieces of legislation to its credit . It is now on the eve of settling one long-fought legislative battle , and possibly two The latest Education Bill goes to the Lords backed by the great mass of moderate opinion in both parties . It is a compromise measure to which the Church of England , through its highest dignitaries , has consented , to which the bulk of Nonconformist opinion is reconciled , and to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for favorable action by the Lords are therefore excellent . The fate of the Licensing Bill is more uncertain The tremendous majority with which it passed the House of Commons , shows how deeply stirred is the country over what few care to deny is really a great moral Issue . It is , however , a great moral issue pitted against very great special interests , and in the ordinary course of events the Lords ' assent would not be forthcoming to " a measure that has been denounced as virtual confiscation . But on the Licensing Bill , too , Mr. Asquith has the Archbishop of Canterbury and many influential bishops with him , and Mr. Balfour must needs hesitate before entering into conflict with the Tory party 's historic allies Emperor William 's bowing to German public opinion lends striking confirmation to a letter which Dr. Theodor Barth wrote to the Manchester Guar , - dean on November 3 , In it , he declared that the Kaiser 's power , or even disposition , to withstand the clearly expressed wishes of the German people was " enormously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy with the view of William II 's supernatural abilities The great trouble has been that the Emperor has constantly been supplied with " false information " Surrounded by favorites and flatterers , he has too often been kept in ignorance of the true sentiment of Germany . This is a danger besetting every monarch , and , we may add , every President . There is no one to tell him the truth . But in the present instance the voice of the German people reached the Imperial ear like the sound of many waters , and the Kaiser both heard it and heeded . This result was distinctly foreseen by Dr Barth , who wrote that the Emperor , with all his pretensions to absolutism , could neither prevent public criticism nor " enforce the consent of public opinion . " Dr. Barth takes a large view of the whole affair . It was but a final proof that political conditions in Germany were becoming " unbearable . " nation has made too mighty an advance to be held longer to medieval notions of government . " lt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barth , " when Germany will be democratized as England , France , and Italy already are . " Be it slow or rapid , the process has been sensibly helped by the Ka.ser 's surrender
