Capture of Troy to the pediment , partly , at least , on account of the discovery of an archaic draped torso , " round the back of which a life-sized arm is roughly sculptured  --  evidently the arm of one grasping the sacred image as a protection against an advancing foe " The proportions show that this fragment belongs to the pediment sculptures rather than to the metopes Dr. Waldstein therefore concludes that the Capture of Troy was represented in the pediment . Now in this scene the person who flees to the divine image for protection must be a Trojan , and the image must be that of a deity friendly to the Trojans But it is difficult to imagine a pediment group so composed that a oeanna , standing of course upon a pedestal , could find its place anywhere except in the centre We should then have the pediment of a Greek temple in honor of Hera adorned with a pediment group in which the most important place was occupied by an image of a deity hostile to the Greeks , and to Hera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure to which the beautiful head discovered in 1892 belongs , and to which he gives the name of Hera , occupied the middle of the pediment . If this is correct ? and the head certainly seems to belong to the pediment sculptures ? it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the reason clasped by a suppliant must find its place elsewhere . Possibly the =anon may have been a part of some group not belonging to the temple , though the rough work on the back shows that it was not intended to be seen from all sides However this may be , there are other reasons for assigning the Capture of Troy to the pediment , even though the argument drawn from the Totnum fail . Several fragments from the metopes , notably one beautiful head , seem to come from figures of Amazons Dr Waldstein therefore believes that the metopes of one side at least of the temple contained scenes from the Amazonomachia , while the metopes of the other side may perhaps have been carved with scenes from the battle of the Centaurs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be impossible within the limits of a brief review to give even a summary of Dr. Waldstein 's able and suggestive discussion of the style of the Hermum sculptures , and a criticism of his views in detail is out of the question He is certainly right in mantaining , in opposition to Professor Furtwangler , that the sculptures belong to the Argive school , and more especially to the school of Polyclitus , though whether the great master himself was charged with " the superintendence , if not the ' designing and elaboration of the sculptured ornamentation of this very temple , " as Dr Waldstein believes , is another matter . The Hermum marbles have the square faces of the works of Polyclitus  --  they have even the peculiar pouting lips which all the works ascribed to Polyclitus show , but these and other peculiarities may be the marks merely of the school , not of the individual artist . Nor does the recurrence on an Argive coin of the anthemion ornament from the cyma of this temple prove that the stephwme of the Hera represented on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same artist . Both may , for instance , be developments of some earlier tradition . The connection of Polyclitus with the decorative sculptures of the Hermum was probably as close as that ofPhidias with the Parthenon sculptures , but how close that was we do not know and probably never shall know . At any rate , the sculptures from the Hermum , even if they are the works of the school of Polyclitus , not of the master himself , enable us to appreciate his qualities as an artist at least as well as do the late copies of his works by which he has hitherto been judged . The volume before us closes with the publication of Inscriptions on Stone by Professor Richardson and Professor Wheeler , and of Stamped Tiles by Professor Richardson The work of the editors is carefully and ably done , but the material is of little general interest , and leads to no important results The editorial committee in charge of the publication has done its work conscientiously and carefully .

The work is dedicated to Prof. Charles Eliot Norton , first President and , we may add , founder of the Archmological Institute . It is eminently fitting that he is thus identified with the most important contribution yet made by American scholars and investigators to classical archasology . Haunts of Ancient Peace . By Alfred Austin . Macmillan . 1902 Moro Solitario . By Edward Thomas . E. P. Dutton &; Co. 1902 . Sir Alfred Austin 's ' Haunts of Ancient Peace ' is an amiable and pacifying work . The narrative of the experiences of a party touring in search of the vestiges of a quieter and less strenuous age , affords the author opportunity to set down many reflections upon the times , relieved by sentiment and gentle humor . In view of the writer 's position as court poet , his characterization of a great English statesman who is nameless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduced here " Is it arrogant to ask how is it possible for any serious person to allow himself to be overawed by the opinion of the present Age , for instance , that , for several years , believed a greatly gifted and splendidly energetic man of action , with an imperious but mercurial mind , a sonorous voice , a commanding manner , and a copious but somewhat redundant vocabulary , but no continuity of judgment , no true insight , to say nothing of foresight , and a curiously perverse sense of patriotism , to be not only a Great Statesman , but one of the greatest that ever lived , and considered any one incorrigibly stupid or bigoted who thought otherwise ? " This typical period is scarcely either sinuous or firm , yet it is not devoid of sense . Indeed , throughout the book the author appears to much better advantage in the prose than he does in the frequent lyrics wherewith his personages oblige the company Yet , when all is said , the volume is a singularly slight affair . We trust we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly decorous attitude toward his Majesty 's Laureate if we venture to suggest that ' Haunts of Ancient Peace ' is most hap pily described in three lines from a poem pronounced by one of the party : ' Nothing stirring , nothing doing . Save white clouds white clouds pursuing , And the ringdove 's lovelong cooing " We come to metal of a clearer tone in Mr. Edward Thomas 's ' Horn ; Solitarim . ' Mr. Thomas 's thought is not robustious , his writing is still somewhat too obviously mannered ; yet his work shows unity and distinction of mood , and a conscious striving after that " lapidary economy " of style which he admires . The fifteen essays , including such taking themes as " Inns and Books , " " Epitaphs as a Form of English Literature , " " The Passing of Pan , " and " Digressions on Fish and Fishing , " are very judiciously made up of leisurely rumination , weighted with timely allusion , both literary and humane , and tempered by bookish , but playful and unaffected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes upon a passage which mellow music and coursing imagination make fit to rank with the best of De Quincey . At such times Mr. Thomas 's writing exhibits a definiteness of form which makes it more truly maseuIme , and hence more thoroughly satisfying , than most composition of this species . The elect readers who are accessible to such charms may justly expect much of a young writer who unites scholarship and sensibility ; who can compass , though it be as yet but momentarily , the effect of " Celtic magic " by brooding , Virgallan workmanship . The Administration of Dependencies : A Study of the Evolution of the Federal Empire , with special reference to American Colonial Problems . By Alpheus H. Snow , G. P. Putnam 's Sons . 1902 . This book is written for the purpose of establishing the paradox that our " Revolutionary forefathers " were imperialists in the sense in which that word is now commonly used . So far from believing that there was no just government without the cersent of the governed , they clearly contemplated , and deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States . Ih spite of the cry " No taxation without representation , " there was in 1771 a substantial unanimity of sentiment in Congress that Great Britain ought to levy taxes in the colonies The great quebtion which agitated the minds of American statesmen " was whether the British Empire was a Federal Empire or a Unitary State . " They were willing to remain in the empire , if it should be declared to be a " Federal organism , " in which the power of the imperial State was not a " limited " but a " conditional " power , the subjection of the colonies being a " conditional subjection . " Their subjection was under an " implied " contract , to the terms of which both parties agreed , and which was conditional in exactly the same way as if the contract had been between equal parties These conclusions , it is maintained by Mr. Snow , were involved in the approval by Congress of Gouverneur Morris 's pamphlet , entitled , ' Observations on the American Revolution , ' which appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union to Great Britain , therefore , was a declaration that the States of the Union would never consent to anything less than a Federal subjection to the State of Great Britain  --  that is , a contractual or conditional subjection , not of the inhabitants of the States of the Union to the State of Great Britain , or to its Government , or to its Inhabitants , but of the States of the Union , as States , to the State of Great Britain . By this declaration , made almost contemporaneously with the declaration contained in the French treaty of alliance that the American Union proposed to hold its conquests as dependencies , the American ' Union bound itself , and its successors , forever , by all the obligations of national good faith , to treat every community external to and connected with the Union as a State in a relationship of Federal subjection . . In case of disagreement between the parties concerning the interpretation of the contract , or concerning what was just and reasonable , when the parties left the terms indefinite , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal . " Adopting Mr Snow 's conclusions , we find them fatal to the present claims of Imperialists The people of the Philippine Islands , in their struggle against the Government of the United States , are situated as the people of the American colonies were in their rebellion against British rule To say that our " implied contract " with the inhabitants of these islands has been interpreted and adjudicated by-an impartial expert tribunal , is an assertion that can hardly be taken seriously . If George III . and his Ministers constituted such a tribunal at the time of the Revolution , the proposition might be admitted , but no one would maintain that theory . It is essential to the concept of a contract that there should be two contracting parties , and that their minds should meet With some straining , we may say that a contract existed between the colonies and Great Britain ; but we can not seriously maintain that the wretched people whom our troops have been slaughtering on the other side of the globe , had entered into any contract with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be to hear such a theory expounded But if Mr. Snow 's theories survive these difficulties , he gives them the coup de grace by his view of the competency of Congress to administer dependencies . His whole Constitutional argument rests on the Ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest Territory , and the clause in the Constitution providing that Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States . In his final chapter , however , Mr. Snow declares that to apply this provision would be to establish , " when viewed from the standpoint of the dependencies , " an administration by an oligarchy of foreigners In order ' to discharge its duty , Congress would have to sit continuously . It would be incompetent in many ways to carry on colonial government . We do not question this , but we need not suppose that Congress will abdicate its functions because Mr. Snow thinks it can not properly discharge them . It may turn them over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure of the patronage The " idea of the Imperial power , " Mr. Snow asserts , " implies opening new markets , not for the Imperial State , but for all the world " Such is not the idea of Congress , or of the Republican party , or of the American people . Notwithstanding the display of research in the citation of ancient documents , we can not regard this work as giving correct views of the past . ' We are told that France , for eight centuries before the Revolution , or until the seventeenth century at least , had a good and orderly government . It had a " harmonious " connection with its colonies , profitable to it , and beneficial to them The necessary adjustments were made judiciously and advantageously France " consulted the wish of the dependencies and regarded their interests . " This just solicitude , it will be remembered , was shown by granting monopolies to exploiting companies , by forbidding the colonists to manufacture their own products or to buy goods not made in France , by restricting trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up to the year 1750 , no one in the American colonies , according to Mr. Snow , " appears to have dreamed that there was anything which was not dignified , just , and proper " in their relationship to Great Britain . It was in 1750. by the way , that Great Britain forbade the manufacture of iron in the colonies . But it would be a waste of time to expose the evils of the colonial administration which Mr Snow regards with such favor . His theories concerning " implied contracts " and " moral obligations " ? " contracts " made , construed , and applied by a strong power in effecting conquests , and " obligations " to itself alone  --  are mere sophistry . He declares explicitly that the United States can levy taxes on its dependencies and enforce their collection , although it thus becomes a judge in its own cause . But Mr. Snow naively continues , " Where one is obliged to judge in his own cause , such obligation increases enormously the moral responsibility . " Of course the familiar goody-goody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have assumed , and the necessity of providing means " for educating the public sentiment so that the people of the American Union may be in position to superintend both the President and Congress .

" The Gs owth , and Decline of the French Monarchy By James Mackinnon , Ph D Longmans , Green &; Co. 1902 Pp. 840 The industry and facile pen of Dr. Mackinnon give us this thick volume on France in close succession to large works on Edward III . and the union of England and Scotland The present disquisition ( for the book is more an essay than a chronicle ) begins with the coronation of Hugh Capet , and closes at the death of Louis XV . The study , as the preface tells us , was undertaken with reference to the origins of the Revolution , but it has so far branched out from this purpose as to have a different character from that which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , " says the author , " apart from its direct bearing on the Revolution . I studied it , in fact , for itself rather than for its ultimate effects I found myself looking at each suesessive reign from the standpoint of its effects on its period rather than on the future , though I have emphasized the prospective tendency of events and institutions as I proceeded . In other words , I have made a study of government in France , under the old regime , in its relation to the nation for the time being " So much may be cited to convey Dr. Mackinnon 's explanation of his chief aim . For our own part , we must say that this book appears to rest upon a radically unsound basis , or at least that the method pursued is not one which helps us to understand the growth and decline of monarchical institutions in France . Dr Mackinnon has not sought to describe the development of institutions " It is of government , " he says , " in connection with contemporary history , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe , a far more important subject It is with the actual operation rather than with the mere form of institutions that I am concerned It is a question of minor importance in my view , whether , for instance , the Council of State was composed of so many individuals , or of so many subordinate councils , compared with the question whether its acts affected France , for the time being , for good or evil " In criticising this statement , we shall admit that administrative forms and the routine of bureaucracy need not be taken up at any great length in a general historical treatise . At the same time , the state is an organism , and the rise of the main political institutions should be seriously considered The medival part of this volume is extremely meagre and altogether inadequate . The five centuries from Hugh Capet to Louis XI . receive one hundred pages , the three centuries from Louis XI to Louis XV . receive seven hundred pages This disproportion is excessive , but it is not all . It might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the Capetian monarchy took form and how it strove with the forces of feudalism ; but throughout the whole of this section the treatment is essentially superficial For a single example we shall quote , in part , Dr. Mackin-non 's comment upon the eleventh century  --  a cycle which is dismissed in half a page , " The eleventh century is a century of pure anarchy in France , with most tragical results to the miserable people , who had no rights and seldom knew what happiness was . The chronicles of the time are grim reading indeed , with their oft-recurring story of famine driving men even to cannibalism , of pestilence , brutality , murder , crass superstition , and leaden , heartless oppression . " A passage like the above almost takes one 's breath away . To be sure , the eleventh century was in many respects a rough and brutal age , but , judged by the test of relative improvement , it will stand comparison with any period of equal length since the decline of the Roman Empire Not only was Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very beacon , as the history of Cluny , of Normandy , of the communes , of Romanesque architecture , and of the First Crusade attests . To say that " the eleventh century is a century of pure anarchy in France " is to dogmatize in great haste and with little thought Our main proposition , however , is that Dr. Mackinnon adopts a wrong attitude towards the evolution of institutions Though purporting to deal with the rise of the French monarchy , he does not show satisfactorily how it took form in the Middle Ages and drove its roots deep into the national soil By neglecting the institutional side , he fails to bring the monarchical institutions of France into comparison with those of other countries at the same period The result is , that we get a somewhat miscellaneous narrative , which is studded with energetic passages , but runs to declamation where it should be soberly tracing the operation of processes . We have not hesitated to express thus plainly an unfavorable opinion of Dr. Mackinnon 's method . So far we have confined our strictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances , he gets into closer touch with his subject , and the book improves ; but throughout there is a failure to explain the organic growth of the monarchical institution . On the other hand , there is much in the book which is better than the treatment of its leading theme . Dr. Mackinnon seeks above everything else to connect the monarchy with the nation at large . " Most important of all , " he says , " is the effect of the exercise of the monarchic power on the people . The grand test of the value of any government is contained in the question , What did it do for the people ? Did it contribute to its elevation , its welfare , its happiness , in the widest sense , or did it not ? Practically every other question is subordinate to this , and I shall have entirely missed the mark if I have not made it clear , all through , whether the government of the French monarchs served , not the aggrandizement of France or the gran ' deur of this or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the grand purpose of the general interest . " With teals appreciation of the value which belongs to social history in its relation to the history of politics , one must heartily sympathize , and Dr Mackinnon does from time to time discuss the effect of government upon the masses . Still , even here expectation is not quite realized , for the courtiers and politicians are more to the fore than the people . The best features of the work are , in our judgment , these : Dr. Mackinnon has a considerable range of reading and writes with evident love of his task . Secondly , he is alive to the importance of social and economic questions . Thirdly , he shows a degree of interest in the emergence of fresh political ideas which lie does not show in the development of political institutions . From the time of Henry IV . forward , this ample volume contains much material which students will find means to use , but we must confess that we have found the earlier portions of it disappointing . Thoreau : His Home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Y. Crowell &; Co . Mr Sanborn 's later study of Thoreau is still recent , and , on the eve of a third and enlarged edition of Ellery Channing 's ' Thoreau , ' we are confronted by a new writer venturing boldly into the once lonely field . Some time since , Thoreau attained to the glory of a de luxe edition , and his vogue has other and more healthy signs of growth . A host of writers swarm upon his track , who are not so much imitators as disciples quickened to a studious love of nature by his spirit . The whirligig of time is bringing many exquisite revenges on that season of inappreciation when , with straining back , he carried seven hundred copies of ' The . Week , ' that had been returned to him as unsalable , to an upper room . But the swelling chorus of repentance has heretofore had no voice so out of tune with Thoreau 's character and mind as that of Mrs. Marble . Her manner of writing affects us the more painfully because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " caught , " as Lowell wrote , " at its living source , among the poets and prose-writers of its best days . " It is remarkable that she could soak her mind in Thoreau 's books and take on so little of their virile tone . Her own style is distinctly young-ladyish . To words that smack of the soil she has a particular aversion . She delights in such as are pretty and sesquipedahan , in such tinsel forms as " basal " and " fontal , " and such compounds as " view-points " and " heart-life .. " A good many adjectives are or appear to be introduced , because they sound nicely , without any reference to their meanings . In general , we do not get the impression of a natural affinity with Thoreau 's work , but of an accidental inclination to him as a good subject for a book , With plenty of good sources , our author permits herself such a congeries of inaccuracies as this , where she is writing of Thoreau 's friend . H. G. 0 . Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , graduating from the Divinity School in 1839 , when Emerson , by his famous address , sent quivers of apprehension through Calvinistic creeds . Mr. Blake ' became deeply interested in Emerson , and adopted many of his theological tenets . He was himself a preacher at Milford , New Hampshire , when Emerson resigned his pastorate and received such sharp censure , especially from Professor Norton " I The necessary corrections are , that Blake graduated in 183g , when Emerson 's address was delivered to the graduating class  --  that the address delighted the Calvinists because it enabled them to say to the Unitarians , " Where are you now ? " ? that it was this address which drew Mr. Norton 's censure , " The Latest Form of Infidelity , " the following year  --  that Einereon 's resignation of his pastorate was then ancient history , having occurred in 1832 , when Blake was but sixteen years old . We do not find much in the way of incident or comment in Mrs. Marble 's book with which the Sanborn and Charming books have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgment of their help , with frequent vaunting of the writer 's novel acquisitions , some of which are interesting and valuable , but injured by the awkward setting which attempts to give them prominence . At many points there is a courageous and often just demur at the judgments expressed by earlier biographers and critics , and , throughout , the writer 's aim , in so far as it is controversial , is to relieve Thoreau from the character of eccentricity which has burdened him , in good part because of his own humorous exaggeration . The " view-point " in this particular is less original with Mrs. Marble than she would proudly fancy it ? she is able to make liberal quotations from her predecessors in defence of her position . But her reiteration does not come amiss . A second reading of the book , after one had learned to discount the writer 's foibles , and to be more amused than irritated by her wordiness , would yield a rather favorable opinion of its main effect . It is convincing that Thoreau was not misanthropic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nature as the solution of the social problem . He found the Maine woods less to his liking than the humanized Concord fields . " What is nature , " he said , " if there be not an eventful human life passing within her ? Many joys and many sorrows are the lights in which she shows most beautiful . " This quotation , though much to Mrs. Marble 's purpose , is one that she has overlooked . But she has others to the same effect : " I think that I love society as much as most , and am ready enough to fasten myself like a blood-sucker for a time en any full-blooded man that comes in my way . I naturally am no hermit , but might possibly sit out the sturdiest frequenter of the barroom if my business called me thither . " This does not counter the Walden episode so much as the popular misconstructions of that " experiment . " A good deal of satire has been wasted on Thoreau 's frequent visits to Concord and his meals there with his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , as the success of Walden proved . It is true , as one of his students has written , that he " represents himself as an epicure rather than an ascetic . " He did not wish to be amenable to the criticism of Emerson 's " Days , " but to get the best afforded and to pass it on , " I would fain communicate the wealth of my life to men , would really give them what is most precious in my gift . I will sift the sunbeams for the public good . " The simplification of life was the main haunt of his thought and purpose . He would disengage himself from those social trappings which are commonly regarded as advantages , but are actually encumbrances . Ills protest is needed now much more than it was when he first uttered it , and one would gladly be assured that the increasing interest in his writings means that his teachings are being taken seriously to heart by a great many people .

This seems to be the real secret , or at least one of the chief reasons , of the fascinating quality of Mr. Nichols 's new book on a very old subject , as his map shows . Leaving Pekin , October 16 , he reached " Sian , " the extreme western limit of his journey , beyond the bend of the Yellow River , November 14 , and , floating down the great Yang-tse-kiang , he reached Shanghai December 22 .

In Pekin he received the red visiting card of Prince Ching , which proved an " open sesame " everywhere , and worth more than all other official documents . With the help of a Scottish missionary , Mr. Duncan , he was able to reach his goal and carry out the eminently CM ietian purpose of his nation , the proprietor of the Christian Herald . He visited the Nestorian tablet , the , refuge camps , and a few interesting places besides , suffered the usual trouble with tenants other than human that preoccupy the bedclothes of China , had no extraordinary adventures , and yet lie tells a story which is attractive on every page .

Before entering China , he , like other Westerners , had thought of its inhabitants as a people homogeneous in body , mind , and outward estate . His surprise was great in finding a wonderful variety . They were different according to their physical environment and inheritances ; one province being in many things no standard for another . In a word , he discovered that here were many tribes of differing origin , history , experience , and religion , while all apparently dissolved in the same solution wrought by language , customs , and social ideas . Beyond the seaports he quickly discovered that foreign influences had but a minimum power of penetration Even the telegraph to Sian was never taken seriously until after the coming of the court , which then kept the wires busy . Now the merchants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four op - eratovs are necessary . He learned that the usual way of showing opprobrium , when one Chinese was angry with another , was to call out " Japanese . " This the author thinks is a survival of the time when " the land of the Mikado was a tribute nation , " but this , we can assure Mr. Nichols , has no historic basis , or at least none better than that which , in China only , asserts that the British , Americans , Germans , French , and Dutch are tribute nations . The  --  term is derived rather from the fact that the Japanese pirates and marauders , for so long a time , centuries ago , kept desolate the coasts of China . Mr. Nichols was charmed with the humanity and good morals of the average Chinaman . His previous notions , instilled in the Sunday-school and by the American newspapers , were all set awry by the kindness which he received , and of which among the natives he was a constant witness . He was surprised at the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He notes the general absence of enduring monuments of China 's antiquity , but sees proofs of the nation 's great age in the landscape itself , especially in those deeply sunken roads , often thirty ' feet below the level of the fields which have been rutted to such depth by the wheeled traffic of centuries . In his philosophy of the subjects which he handles jauntily , we can not usually agree with him . He saw only the crowded lines of - traffic and places of habitation , and land which for the most part is fertile , and therefore densely populated . One may gain an entirely wrong idea from some of his statements , which need a work like that of ' An ' American Engineer in China ' for correction As matter of fact , the densest population is massed on the fertile plates and in the river valleys , while large portions of China proper and even more of the Empire at large are but thinly inhabited .

A glow of humor lends added brightness to many pages . Mr Nichols is at his best in describing the mandarins and the play of Chinese human nature in every-day life . His quiet manner of calling attention to things that are very " heathen " in Western ideas , but very Christian in reality , is highly effective He is moderate and self-controlled in describing the famine-desolated districts , though his description of the sale of meat balls made from the bodies of- human beings who died of hunger , and sold for four cents a pound , is sufficiently realistic As a result of famine conditions , dysentery and cholera broke out and swept away thousands who had escaped the worst rigors of hunger .

John , Ruskin . By Frederic Harrison . Macmillan Co. 1902 . Mr. Harrison touches nothing that he does not adorn . Such an adept in the art of writing could make even an ordinary man seem worthy to be enshrined in the " English Men of Letters " series ; and when he has a subject like John Ruskin , the result is a magnificent apotheosis . Ruskin , he tells us , was the writer of the Victorian era who poured forth the greatest mass of literature upon the greatest variety of subjects , and about whom most was written in his own lifetime in Europe and in America . Many biographies of him already exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still abundant ; It is certainly well that he himself was chosen for this task ; for by admiration , affection , common ideals , aims , and sympathies , he is exceptionally qualified . Ruskin 's place as an artist , and as a critic of art , is too well known to require much to be said of it , and Mr. Harrison attempts little more than to characterize briefly the great books which first made the young author famous . He expatiates more , and perhaps sufficiently , on Ruskin as a social reformer . He admits that Ruskin 's diatribes were full of sound and fury , but finds them significant of something The chief principle of the political econo my of this modern prophet was that " the conditions producing material wealth are inextricably intermingled with the general conditions of a healthy and worthy body politic .

So far , Positivism is in harmony with Ruskmism , but very few people think that sociology has advanced enough to be applied practically . As to what Ruskin accomplished in his promiscuous polemics , Mr. Harrison is explicit enough . Ruskin , he declares , was utterly unfitted to construct a social philosophy , by his very scanty learning , by habit , and by the cast of his mind . " He can only throw forth a few suggestions , more or less echoes of Plato , the Bible , medieval art , and Carlyle . Nothing less adequate as a coherent and systematic synthesis of society can be imagined .

But it was a haphazard process , and the task of reconciling his utterances with one another and with facts would be as futile as that of the commentators who act on the theory that the Hebrew prophets knew what the history of the world was to- be. , Carlyle said that Ruskin had a " divine rage against falsity , " and he constantly prophesied in the name of Truth . In fact , few writers have ever shown a more reckless disregard of truth . His pages are crammed with false statements of fact , and with grossly libellous accusations . He was destitute of the " scientific conscience , " which has sternly consigned so many pretty hypotheses to oblivion , and ' which recognizes nothing as true until it has been proved by the severest tests which reason can apply . He preached of sweetness most bitterly ; he praised thoroughness , and never attempted to ground himself in political science , he raved of a past which he absurdly misinterpreted , and he rhapsodized over a future which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton that his commentary on Revelations was apparently meant to console the human race for the superiority he had over it ; and Ruskin 's political disquisitions may cause the humblest reader to think better of , his- own intellect .

The Origin and Significance of Hegel 's Logic : A General Introduction to Hegel 's System . By J. B. Baillie . Macmillan Co. 1901. 8vo , pp. xviii , 375. - ' This book is , on the whole , of any that we have seen , the most helpful for a student prepared to take up the study of Hegel It is not designed as a substitute for " reading Hegel 's own works , but , as the title-page proclaims , as an introduction to such reading , It explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other works came to be written , which is what the student of any system should desire to learn , first of an . In saying this , we are supposing that the student is not a neophyte in philosophy . When a man first takes up the study of philosophy , his difficulty , at the outset , is that he is already Possessed by a. crude system of metaphysics , and that , while he has a vague curiosity to know why others ' do not think as he does , he really has no desire to learn . After that first difficulty Is conquered , he has to make a study of some one system of philosophy , which , how-aver , it is impossible for him really to unrderstand at this stage , because he does not comprehend the original state of mind of the author at the time his original studies were begun . In the case of Hegel he must , as a matter of course , understand Kant , and especially the deduction of the categories , not only as his doctrine appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appeared to the young theological students who read it while it was fresh . He will necessarily make some study of Fichte 's ' Wissenschaftslehre ' and of some of the earlier writings of Schelling . He can then take up this book of Dr. Baillie 's with profit , and thereafter the study of Hegel ( in German , of course , for the ' Logik ' is , in a sense , a dissertation on the German language ) will not present any insuperable difficulties , unless Hegel 's own inaccuracies be considered such . In particular , he should have carefully read Dr. Baillie 's admirable concluding chapter , entitled " Criticism . " His only danger will then be that of overlooking , what Hegel entirely overlooks and Dr. Baillie does not distinctly recognize , that thought and " immediacy " are not the only factors of experience . To avoid that danger he ought to be penetrated with the spirit of science , to understand English thought , that of Herbert , that of Fries , and be well acquainted with modern exact logic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not but feel that the mere contemplation of the problems he presents is good . But that the study of Hegelianism tends too much toward subjectivism , and is apt td break that natural power of penetrating fallacy which is common to all men except students of logic , especially of the German stripe -- seems to be the result of experiencd.
