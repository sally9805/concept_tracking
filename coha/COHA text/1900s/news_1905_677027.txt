Lieut . Gov . Bruce had ordered the default of Justice Hooker to be entered upon the Journals of both houses , when Judge W. W. Goodrich of counsel for Justice Hooker appeared and explained that his client had been delayed , but would be present in a few moments . It developed that , notwithstanding the fact that Justice Hooker and his counsel had been notified that the joint Assembly Would meet at 1 o'clock . they lunched leisurely at the Ten Eyck and then strolled leisurely up to the Capitol , nearly a half hour later . It was 1:17 o'clock when the Senators filed into the Assembly Chamber . The Assemblymen , at the stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a crescent four lines deep about the row of Senators . Another stroke of the gavel and all the legislators sat down . Lieut . Gov . Bruce went to the Speatter 's platform and took charge of the joint session . Twentyeight Senators and eighty-two Assemblymen were present , only a few more than a quorum in each instance . Inside the space encircled by the Senators were four tables for the joint Judiciary Committee of the Legislature , the Legislature 's counsel , and Justice Hooker 's counsel . At 1:28 o'clock the Lieutenant Governor Said : " The Clerk of the Senate will call the name of Mr. Justice Warren B. Hooker . " Clerk Gleason called the name in a loud tone . Every one , from the Lieutenant Governor and the women in the gallery to the members on the floor , looked expectantly toward the main doar , half guarded by a large red ' screen . ' ' The Clerk of the Senate will call the name of Mr. Justice Hooker a second time , " said the Lieutenant Governor . Once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all eyes were focused on the red screen . When it was evident that no reply was forthcoming the Lieutenant Governor said : " It will be stated on the Journal that the name of Mr. Justice Hooker was twice called with no response , and his default will be noted on she Journal . " There was speculation on every side as to the non-appearance of the Justice . Rumors were started that he had resigned . Others ventured that he would ignore the Legislature altogether . Even the leaders seemed to be nonplused , for it was known that the Justice and his counsel were in the city . After a restless interval of a minute or more on the part of the joint body , Chairman Brackett of the Senate Judiciary Committee said : " Before noting the default , I suggest that the Clerk informally communicate with the Justice or his counsel , to learn if the default is intentional .

" The words were scarcely out of his mouth before Justice Hooker strolled round the edge of the red screen and came into view . Walking with him were two more of his attorneys , Mr. Stanchfield and Mr Carr . Some might have termed the Justice 's stride as a sort of studied saunter as he came down the aisle . He paused as he came to the edge of the well , while his counsel - walked on to their table . In the meantime Clerk Gleason again called the name of Justice Hooker . Here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you represented by counsel ? " asked the Lieutenant Governor . " I am , " said the Justice , taking a seat between Attorneys Carr and Goodrich . HOOKER MAKES ANSWER .
