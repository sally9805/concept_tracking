Judge Parker is getting on  --  he is now a " traitor . " This epithet is hurled at him for his emphatic speech of Saturday advocating justice to the Filipinos But what did he say ? Simply what all Americans , those who now denounce him first among them , would have said prior to May 1 , 1898 . Judge Parker merely did the appalling thing of reiterating the historic American policy . When he said that oppressed peoples ought to be free , even when this country is the oppressor , and that government without consent is repugnant to American principles , he was uttering what would have been thought the merest commonplaces six years ago . Now they are incendiary . But the real flame is of others ' setting . As Goldwm Smith said , the United States burned up the Declaration of Independence when it conquered the Filipinos It did more than that . It relieved Spain , as Judge Parker tersely said , of a thorn which had been in her side for centuries , to thrust it into our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Uncle Sam 's simplicity in entering upon a heritage of trouble Sooner or later , self-interest will lead us out of ' the Philippines , if the sense of justice does not . Judge Parker 's strong and truthful words indicate a national duty Those whose love of liberty goes deeper than the lips , should repair to the standard which he has raised . With lawyer-like seizure of the real point at issue , the Parker Constitution Club 's report on the Panama lawlessness of President Roosevelt goes swiftly to the core of that nefarious business . Wasting no words on the Constitutional right of the President to " recognize " the republic of Panama white it was still pawing to get free of the slime of conspiracy  --  no doubt , Mr. Roosevelt had the power to do that shockingly indecent thing , if he had the conscience V do it  --  the report singles out the steps which neither the Constitution nor common morals entitled him to take . One was to violate a treaty ; the other was toforbid the free passage of Colombia 's troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keeping transit open across the isthmus . Mr. Roosevelt issued that fifty-mile order which so good a Republican as Senator Spooner admitted that he could not defend Nay , according to the note which Admiral Coghlan sent to Gen Reyes. our forces were ordered to prevent the - Colombians from landing in any part of the province of Panama . This means that President Roosevelt assumed jurisdiction over much more than fifty miles of Colombian soil . To do so was , of , course , an act of war , and warrant for it can not be found in all the argument or all the wit of Mr. Roosevelt 's apologists . How startling President Roosevelt 's course in Panama was to the older Republicanism , Senator Hoar showed at the time , now , we have ex-Senator Edmunds , with his merciless analysis of the facts and the law , saying that Mr. Roosevelt " dismembered a friendly State to get a canal " The mere , fact that two of the eight Presidential tickets in the field this year are hound to receive nearly all of the votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independent published last week a collection of articles from the Presidential nominees of five of these parties , Populist , Prohibition . Social Democrat , Socialist Labor , and National Liberty . A candidate who has no expectation of being elected is relieved of the haunting fear of committing himself indiscreetly , or making " breaks . " This very fact , combined with the earnestness and the exceptional point of View which take a man into one of these dissident movements , makes the articles interesting . A vote for ei't'her Roosevelt or Parker must be cast in the vast majority of cases from highly complex motives ; but the other candidates make the simplest of appeals . Dr. Swallow has reduced the needs of the situation to one reform ; Mr. Watson to eight , which naturally group themselves together ; Mr. Delis and Mr. Corregan to a reconstitution of society an lines that are beautifully simple until the details have to be worked aut . Although differing more ra'di'cally from one another than they do from the great parties , the points of View of these candidates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned the game of the kings , ' Divide in order to rule , ' " says Mr. Watson . " Having split the people into two factions , one called Republican and the other Democrat , the corporations rule the land , first through one of these parties , and then through the other " Dr. Swallow agrees as to the offence , but names another offender . " To divide favors with these parties and thus keep both in the field is the policy of the liquor traffic , " he says " Between the Republican party , and the Democratic party there is no difference So far as the workingman is concerned , " says Mr Deb 's cent . of the total vote . They are all hopeful of better things now . Watson 's theory that neither Gold nor Bryan Democrats should vote for Parker would logically point to a Populistic landslide . Swallow sees " sonic hope that from each side there are those who will leave the old , and , coming half way , meet each other as a new organization . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions is certain . He points to 240,795 votes in 1902 , and promises the casting of many more this year . The claim of George Edwin Taylor , candidate of the National Liberty party , that 60 per cent . of the negroes in nine specified States will vote for him , means , by the census figures . nearly 200,000 . Both the Socialists and Prohibitionists cast in 1900 and 1902 votes larger than that of Birney , whose candidacy in 1844 drew enough Abolitionists from the Whig Party to elect Polk , or than that of John P. Hale , the Free Soil candidate in 1852 , and almost as large as that of Van Buren in 1848 . And , if the services of minor parties are to be considered , we must not forget that it was the Prohibitionists fusing with the Lemocrats on one State office that put Mr. Cunneen in position for his present invaluable service in this State . One of the reasons given for the fight against La Follette was that the sound judgment of the people of Wisconsin favored giving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided last week to keep in the field their own candidate , who has already served two terms , while as an alternative many of them will vote for the Democratic nominee , who is an aspirant for his third . That is the comedy of the situation . The tragic element has been furnished by the efforts of the men who tried to bring about party harmony . When so eminent a pacificator as Senator Spooner has failed pitiably , it is idle to talk of outside efforts accomplishing anything . The failure of the Supreme Court to decide the technical merits of the bolt last spring gives the Stalwarts an excuse for still calling themselves Republicans , but it seems to have brought about a complete ' exchange of arguments between the two sides Three weeks ago it was the La Follette men who resented the National Committee 's activity . Now , it is the Stalwart who winces . Then it was the Stalwart who declaimed against the candidate who would refuse to give up the fight after a judicial mandate . Now , he is himself galled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corruption of the Brayton. machine . The leaders are no longer sure of a majority , as is shown by the election of Congressman Granger in 1902 and the election and reelection of Guirernor Garvin Both these popular Democrats have been renominated , and not only they may win for themselves , but their strength may actually imperil the electoral vote. - Menaced by this danger , the Republican managers have persuaded Chief Justice , Stiness to run for Congress , in the hope that his character and standing may give the party a . respectability which it sorely needs . The Chief Justice is on the whole the most dignified and powerful officer of the State ; for the Governor has no veto and controls few appOintments . Hie step , therefore , from the bench into the ? hurly-burly of partisan politics , to enter a contest in which he seriously risks defeat , is evidence that he as well as his fellow-Republicans feel that they are facing a grave Grin 's . Governor Odell 's attempt to prevent qualified voters in this city from being e ien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time that his perceptions are so dense that he is not aware of the inevitable reaction caused by his high-handed interference . He practically avows that he gave the urder which led to the outrages of Friday and Saturday . In the most indefensible and brutal manner , well-known citizens ? clergymen , public officials , reputable professional and business men ? were met at the registration booths with challenges implying that they were criminals . Men whom district captains of both parties stood ready to identify as residents of the district were rudely accused of trying to violate the law . The thing was done with such wholesale effrontery , with its malicious object standing so plainly confessed , that it can but add to the repulsive implications of Odellism . The right of the State authorities to aid in preventing electoral frauds in this city we have not questioned The power conferred by the statute is , however , one to be used scrupulously and with a high sense of responsibility . GOT . Odell would wield it as an instrument of partisan terrorism . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' illegal voting , he exhibits incredible recklessness . His hirelings challenge right and left . evidently without investigation or knowledge , and on so sweeping and senseless a scale as to discredit the motives of the whole proceeding . It is the iron hand of the Governor applied to this city  --  exactly that sort of combination of stupidity and callousness on his part which led despondent Republicans to say in advance : " Well , if Odell concludes to come down here and take us all by the throat , It looks as if there would n't be enough Republican votes in New York to be worth counting . " Last December , Messrs . Conrad and Bonaparte. the Post-Office investigators reported that Cornelius Van Cott had been operating with Heath and Beavers in swindling the Government . Van Cott paid Beavers $4 a day , charged against New York " expenses . " Messrs Conrad and Bonaparte describe the transaction as " fraudulent " and add . " We find it impossible to doubt that Mr. Heath , Mr Van Cott , and Mr Beavers himself all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law , and that it was called ' expenses ' to evade this prohibition " Still , the influence of Senators was strong , and a President who believes that " no man who condones corruption in others can possibly do his duty by the community , " kept Van Cott in office . Then a set of inspectors recommended the removal of Van Cott , his son , and twelve subordinates , but Platt stood by them The President , who despises cravens and weaklings , wanted something milder , and got it from Assistant Attorney-General Robb , who censured Van Cott for allowing the son too much authority . The elder was asked to disgorge $2,100 ? $1,800 paid to his brother nominally for inspecting mail-boxes and really for doing nothing , and $300 more illegally paid Richard ; but he stuck to his place . Richard was forced out , for he had stuffed the post-office with his heelers ; he received $3,200 from the Government , but gave most of his time to his private business ; he quartered on the post-office , at a salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , as a stenographer , gave most of her time also to private business In short , the Van Cott family proved to be an uncommonly thirsty set of leeches One of the Van Cott henchmen , a postal employee , was arrested with Richard , on Saturday , on a charge of colonizing voters . In view of these latest revelations , no one can deny that the retention in the New York post-office of Cornelius is a public scandal , for which President Roosevelt can offer no defence except his fear of offending Senator Platt . The threatened boycott of the Pennsylvania Republican party by organized labor is indeed sharper than a. serpent 's tooth It is nothing less than incredible that intelligent American workingmen should allow any dispute over terms of employment , any fight against a " scab " State Capitol , to blind them to the great central truth that all the good things they have in the world came to them as the direct gift of the Republican party All have come in the same way , from their full dinner-pails to the carpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tWip decades has failed to mention those carpets and pianos ? Do not these besotted Pennsylvanians know that no less an authority than Gen. Charles H. Grosvenor filled more than twenty pages of the Congressional Record last winter with an anthology of Mr. Roosevelt 's enthusiastic expressions about the laboring man ? Look through that supreme repository of political truth , the Republican campaign-book . " Labor and Capital , relative share in prosperity " , " effects of Trustson " ; " Labor Laws in Republican and Democratic States " ? such titles abound . Is all this logic , all this statistical material , to be wasted ? Senator Penrose has been in conference with the President , and something may be done about it . But the very idea of a labor boycott of the Republican party in that seventh heaven of protection , Pennsylvania , is enough to make even a Rough Rider 's blood run cold . Reports of white-capping in darkest Mississippi continue to come in , albeit belated . The outrages in Lincoln County have been so serious that a delegation of negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " appealed last month to Gov . Vardaman . He asked them who had advised them to come to him . They replied that no one had , whereupon he gave them the vague assurance that " the officers of the law would protect them " We hope they will . The Lincoln Times gives an account of a meeting of white citizens held to consider these outrages and " in order that the citizens might realize the depths of depravity to which the white-cap organization has descended . " The executive committee appointed by a previous citizens ' meeting last spring reported that its discoveries were " horrifying . " ' This band ( which once included many good citizens who have since dropped out because they could not stomach the lawlessness proposed ) have not balked at plotting the wholesale destruction of property , or even the assassination of white men whose existence they deemed dangerous to their welfare . " The meeting heartily endorsed the crusade against these bandits , condemned " white-capism in all its phases , " and agreed " to assist in upholding law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are learning that lawlessness in the treatment of negroes inevitably means lawlessness for whites also . In charging the Federal grand jury at Huntsville , Ala. , on October 11 , Judge Thomas G. Jones of the Northern District of Alabama laid down a new theory of Federal jurisdiction over negro lynchings . He set forth his views at length , with frequent citations of authority , but the reasoning is very simple . " Under the Thirteenth Amendment , " the judge gays , " Maples the negrb murderer $aken from jail and lynched at Huntsville had the immunity as a citizen of the United States to be protected ' against lawless violence by the mob of whites to prevent his enjoyment of the right of trial - . . when such violence was directed towards ' him because ne was a negro , with the intention to deprive him of that right . " Thus a fundamental distinction as made . If the lynching of Maples was provoked purely by abhorrence ' of his crime , it would be merely an offence against the State laws " If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more than a mere felonious purpose to avenge the crime imputed to - him , or general malevolence , and that the mob was actuated by the bad spirit that a person of Maples 's race when accused of crime should not have the right to be acquitted if innocent , or condemned or punished by the court if guilty , and tnat the mob hung him to prevent his enjoyment of that right because of his race , his murder by a mob of persons of a different race Constitutes a crime against the laws of the United States . " Judge Jones wisely added , in Baying down this-contention , that every officer and juror of the Federal Court was an Alabamian , and there was not the slightest reason for jealousy of it as an intruder . It is for the best that these views should be laid down in the case of a negro whose crime was homicide . Yet Judge Jones , in continuing his charge , showed clearly the impossibility of condemning lynching for ? the lesser crime while condoning it for the greater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain , " he asked , " picture Robert E Lee or John B. Gordon , no matter what the charge against the criminal , joining a mob to break down a jail and taking a prisoner out to hang him ? " " Can any of us , as conscientious men , deny that - . . there is a deplorable tendency to mob black men for crimes and misdemeanors which , when committed by white men , are allowed to go unpunished or left to the courts to punish ? " And the responsibility for much of the lawlessness the judge placed where it ' belongs . " There are those with us , " he said , " who , for notoriety , or to carry some selfish end , always make low appeals to the basest passions of our race , in the discussion of every public question which in the slightest degree touches upon the relations between the races . These men constantly assault the right of equality before the law , by the base teaching that giving a negro his right under the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? justice without respect of persons ' involves neither social nor political right . " One point marls by Professor Sumner in his letter printed in Thursday 's Evening Post should interest those generous souls who defend protection upon the ground that charity begins at home , for nations as well as individuals . Free trade , say they , might be the best thing for the whole world if the whole world could be induced to try it . But if the United States can make more by sticking to protection and let the loss due to an unscientific , inequitable distribution of the world 's wealth fall on England or Germany , it would be crazy policy to experiment with free trade . Let the foreigner look after himself . Professor Sumner , however , shows that our present policy of selling goods for export ? far below the prices asked for the same goods in this country , is helping along our hated rivals at the expense of the American people If the goods , even at these export prices , yield a profit , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss , then our own people , who are paying , about 25 per cent . more for them here , are taxed by the Trusts in an outrageous fashion The horns of the dilemma seem to be about equally pointed . The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has been compelled to pay duty on the frame of a painting shipped from Montreal and entered at St. Albans , though the picture itself came in free under the tariff-law section applying to educational institutions The director of the Museum declares it is the first case of his knowledge in which the institution has had to pay duty on a ' picture frame , but he is told by the Custom House authorities that it wall not be the last . Under a very similar section of the tariff law in 1887 the frames for pictures in the Corcoran Gallery were admitted free . The plight of the Museum authorities is indeed pitiable . They denounce the law and its interpretation at unjust , as if that would help the matter , and ignore the simple means by which the most drastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Senator ?

Surely , the heart that was touched by the wailing of the pickled sheepskins , will not turn to marble when Art holds out her manacled hands . A writer in Cassier 's Magazine , Mr. Joseph R. Oldham , NA. , disputes Rear-Admiral Bowles 's assertion in the last annual report of the Bureau of Construction and Repair , that the time required , for the construction of a battleship in this country " compares not unfavorably with the best results obtained in foreign countries , namely , Great Britain and Germany . " He points out that the American battleship Ohio was two and a half years on the stocks , whereas the Rivadiva , bulit at Genoa by an Italian firm was IALlizqecl. 7401- in thirty weeks from the time the keel was laid . A larger ship , the Libertad , was put overboard at Barrow-in-Furness within forty-one weeks from the beginning of construction . One of our latest battleships , the Louisiana , was contracted for October 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be delivered ready for sea in March , 1906 , a period of three and one-half years . The Connecticut 's keel was laid in March , 1902 , and she was launched September 29 , 1904 . Mr. Oldham asserts that if there were not such constant changing of the plans by the Board of Construction , the superintending constructor , and the contractors , and so much time lost in trying to harnaonizethe changes , a ' battleship could be bu , in twelve months , and at half the cost . Mr. Oldham himself has seen a 5,000-ton cable steamer constructed , launched and completely finished , with all her complicated machinery , within three months from the date of the contract , largely because the builders had matured designs which were in no way altered . Mr. Oldham may take too rosy a view of our builders ' ability , but he clearly proves that our wasteful Government methods are not confined to the ' Post-Office Department and the navy yards . The engagement south of Mukden pre cipitated by General Kuropatkin 's advance last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been incessantuntil now , when we are still unable to announce anything decisive of the battle or the campaign . On both sides there have been blows to receive as well as to give , strategic positions have been lost , taken , and retaken , guns have been captured . No successful flanking movement is reported , and the situation is something in the nature of a deadlock ; at least the advance is stayed . The fierce nature of the fighting , and the extraordinary losses , are compared to those of Liaoyang , with an increment ; but exact information in either case is unobtainable . Some discount must be made in view of the lack of unbiassed testimony and of the highly romantic nature of the conflict itself ; but we may be sure that none of the horrors of war are wanting .
