 |p689  ONE September afternoon in 1900 there was a large gathering of people upon the campus of the University of Minnesota . The occasion was the unveiling of a statue of John S. Pillsbury , presented by the alumni and students in honor of a man who had not only achieved more for the institution than any score of other men , but who by his life and public services had been a conspicuous and forceful example of the possibilities of American citizenship . In his address of presentation , the president of the alumni association used these words : We rejoice , too , that he in whose honor this statue is raised is present to take part in these exercises . We have erected it now to impress upon him how deeply we appreciate what he has ( lone for us . We desire that he should know during his lifetime how much we esteem and honor him , not waiting to say it over his ashes . A testimonial to Mr. Pillsbury , , during his lifetime " was peculiarly appropriate , for he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in doing things at the time , a man who spent himself , his time , his energies , his skill , his means , from day to day during his lifetime . " He felt deeply the obligations of citizenship , and knew that they could not be adequately met by postmortem distributions of wealth . He saw , perhaps more clearly than most men , that good citizenship consists in more than personal probity and the right ballot on election day . Personal service is required ; and such service he gave , beginning with modest labors and gradually extending his sphere of usefulness as his ideas developed and as his means increased . It is a very conservative estimate that he spent more than one-third of his life , after removing to Minnesota , in the service of the public . And this does not mean that he was politically ambitious and sought office . Official preferment came to him without solicitation or seeking , was for the most part entirely without compensation , and in all cases was accepted at a personal financial loss . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found , upon his death , to be less than one-third the lowest estimates placed upon its value by the public . Although a shrewd man of business , Mr. Pillsbury had spent too much time in unrequited public service , and had used his means too freely for the public needs , to become the multimillionaire that he was commonly believed to be . And so characteristic of the man was it to do and give when the opportunity or emergency arose , that it was scarcely surprising to find that he died without making any bequests . In speaking to me a few months ago of his last project for the public , he said , quaintly : I want to do these things while I am living . " Were many pages to be written of the life and work of Mr. Pillsbury , it would be found that the keynote of his character had been struck in what has been said . Unwritten , and perhaps  |p690  unthought , his impulse always was : " Act ; act now ; act effectively ; act for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who " does things . " While Mr. Pillsbury 's environment during the greater part of his active life was especially suited to such a character as his , there was nothing dramatic either in his origin , growth , or achievement . When he came to Minnesota , in 1855 , he came , as did thousands of others , with the belief that the great Northwest offered promise of fortune to young men of pluck and energy but with little means . His training had been that of so many other successful Westerners ? a moderate amount of schooling and an early beginning of the battle of self-support in a New England village . His ancestors were New Hampshire pioneers of Puritan stock and noted for , personal integrity and force of character . " At the time when the boy of to-day usually enters the high school , John S. Pillsbury , following the custom of the region , commenced to learn a trade . But his taste for mercantile business brought him soon into the employ of an older brother in a country store , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily be believed that there was a similarity of character between these two young partners , for one subsequently became governor of his native commonwealth and the other served with like honor in his adopted State of Minnesota . When the young man of twenty-seven established himself at the village of St. Anthony , Minn. , in the year 1855 , he is described as a man of modest demeanor , slow of speech ? perhaps , in the estimation of his neighbors , a very commonplace sort of man . Upon reaching his new home , Mr. Pillsbury opened a hardware store . It is a notable and interesting fact that this hardware business , established by Mr. Pillsbury , is the only pioneer business establishment of Minneapolis which has continued to the present time . He long since severed his connection with the concern , but it has continued with unbroken success , and is now the largest wholesale hardware business west of Chicago and St. Louis . The difficulties surrounding a business man in Minnesota in 1855 can hardly be appreciated by the merchant of to-day . Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1855 , when I first reached the Falls of St. Anthony , where now stands the commanding city of Minneapolis , I arrived in a stage-coach . The railroads were then only completed to Rock Island , Ill. , some seven hundred miles distant . The distance from Rock Island to St. Paul was made by steamboat , and the remainder of the trip was made in a Concord stage-coach . There were then less than a thousand people around the Falls of St. Anthony . This was but a part of the story . Minnesota . then but a territory , was an almost unbroken wilderness west of the villages of St. Anthony and Minneapolis . The market for a business man 's wares must be found among the ' ' less than a thousand people " and the scattered settlements fringed along the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers for a scant hundred miles . Of means of transportation there were none except an occasional steamboat , the bateaux of the halfbreed traders , and the " Red River carts , " which toiling oxen dragged slowly across the prairies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everywhere the settlers were menaced by the presence of thousands of Indians . The country did not yield the common products of the soil in sufficient quantities for its  |p691  own consumption . The foundations of the great manufactures of flour and lumber at St. Anthony Falls were scarcely laid . It is significant that from the first Mr. Pillsbury was successful . It is said of him that in these early days he held his trade because he never misrepresented the quality or value of his goods , and because he was uniformly courteous to people of every class and condition , and very early manifested those warm sympathies which so enriched his later years . Almost at the outset he experienced a catastrophe which would have broken most men . Scarcely two years after commencing business at St. Anthony , and in the midst of the financial panic of 1857 , he lost about thirty-eight thousand dollars by fire . This not only wiped out all his accumulations , but left him under a heavy indebtedness . In the critical financial condition of the country , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pillsbury had already so well established his credit that he was enabled to secure an extension from his creditors and at once to resume business . For five years Mr. Pillsbury had not a single new suit of clothes ? but in five years every debt was paid . The payment of this debt developed an incident which Governor Pillsbury could occasionally be induced to relate . When the first note became due he was able to pay but $25 on an account of $1,200 ? but $25 he paid , with a promise of more . His Eastern creditor accepted the money , and before the second was due the first note was paid in full . One or two more were paid in the same way . Then Mr. Pillsbury , to his surprise , received the other notes indorsed to " John S. Pillsbury , for collection , " with the request that he send the money for them as he was able . At a time when Western credits were much distrusted by Eastern merchants , this was a compliment to the young hardware dealer of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business career was one of notable achievement . But successful as it was , it is overshadowed , in an estimate of his life , by the other great work which he took up even before he had established himself on a firm commercial footing . Possibly on account of his own lack of early educational privileges , Mr. Pillsbury watched with keen interest the affairs of the University of Minnesota ? an institution which was not more than a name at the time of his arrival in the Territory . Endowed by a Congressional land grant , the university existed on paper until 1856 , when a building was commenced on a beautiful campus overlooking the Falls of St. Anthony . Ill-advised though well-meant plans , followed by the finan/ cial crash of 1857 , so involved the institution that the early sixties found it apparently hopelessly in debt , with an unfinished building and no prospect of ever establishing a faculty or offering education to the youth of Minnesota . It seemed that the building and campus would be lost on a mortgage , and that the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's interest in the institution was known , and in the autumn of 1863 a friend walked into his hardware store and told him that Governor Swift desired to appoint him upon the board of regents . Scarcely free from the financial difficulties already mentioned , Mr. Pillsbury at first said that he could not accept . But after a forcible statement of the situation from his visitor , he yielded to the impulse to help which was characteristic of his life . " I thought for a moment , and then told him I would accept the appointment , " is his simple reference to this ? a momentous incident in the history of a great institution . Without going into what might prove a tedious description of the financial condition of the University of Minnesota at the time , it may be sufficient to say that the campus and building and the land grant were encumbered with mortgage bonds which , with other indebtedness , amounted to nearly one hundred thousand dollars . At such a time , ? it was the middle of the war period , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regent , Mr. Pillsbury became a State Senator , and through his exertions a new law was passed placing the affairs of the institution in the hands of three regents , with full powers to adjust its obligations on such terms as they might deem best , and as if they were their own . Such unlimited authoritv has seldom been given a public board . But the situation was critical , and called for unusual measures . Every one predicted failure ? even Governor Pillsbury 's associates on the board of regents . But they did not know their man . With iron will and a persistency which knew no defeat , Mr. Pillsbury entered on a campaign of adjustment of the claims against the university . He sold lands , and with the cash compromised claims at such figures as might be arranged . GOVEmc The difficulties of such a task at such a time can not be realized in these days . The lands offered were inaccessible ; the creditors were widely scattered , and of many minds as to the value of their securities . The vexations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miles through a new country hunting up lands or showing them to creditors or buyers . He traveled to the East ; he wrote letters innumerable . He brought into play all the resources of a skillful man of business . Notwithstanding the difficulties of the undertaking , in four years he was able to report that the debt of the university had been cleared away , leaving intact thirty-two thousand acres out of the grant of forty-six thousand , and with the campus and building free of incumbrance . Governor Pillsbury afterward made great successes in business , and proved himself a clever and adept financier ; but , considering the circumstances , notbing which he did in later years equaled this financiering of the affairs of the bankrupt University of Minnesota . And it is no discredit to his associates to attribute the success to him ; it was well known at the time that his energy , his enthusiasm , his business sagacity , were the moving forces of the work . Following his achievement in relieving the university of its financial burden , the institution was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work commenced . Governor Pillsbury , of course , remained a regent , and with a fatherly interest watched over every step of its progress during the remainder of his life . To recount all that he has done for the institution would require  |p693  a volume . Without a liberal education himself , he had a very keen appreciation of the needs of an institution of higher learning . And here it should be said that , through reading and association , Governor Pillsbury finally became a man of education and high cultivation . Largely through his sagacity , the university has been much favored in its presidents and faculty . Early in its career , the question of coeducation came up . Mr. Pillsbury threw his influence to the side of equal educational advantages to young men and young women . No one now thinks of questioning the wisdom of this decision . From the beginning , Governor Pillsbury was the financial guide of the institution . A s has been stated , he became a State Senator about the time that he was first appointed regent . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriations for the struggling college ( for it was nothing more than a college at first ) , and he was also the means of consolidating the land grant made directly to the university and that for the aid of agricultural education and experiment work . This meant millions to the institution ? but potential millons . Meanwhile , there was often a scarcity of dollars for current expenses and other needs . But by this time Mr. Pillsbury was becoming a man of means ; and these means were often at the disposal of the institution he so much loved . A few incidents will illustrate . It was one of the provisions of the reorganized university charter that an experimental farm should be established in connection with the agricultural department . A piece of land adjoining the campus was available , but there was no money with which to buy . Mr. Pillsbury bought the farm , turned it over to the university , and waited for his pay . The land cost $8,500 . It was subsequently sold for about $150,000 . With the proceeds he negotiated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of the work , and sufficient funds were left over to commence the equipment . This property afterward advanced enormously in value . In like way he rescued from the hands of private owners a piece of land which cut off the campus from the main street frontage adjoining . In the selection of lands for the university under the grant from Congress , his extensive acquaintance with the value of pine " stumpage " was of large pecuniary value to the institution . But these were all loans ? loans of time , money , or experience . On April 6 , 1889 , a joint committee of the State Legislature was discussing with the university regents the needs of the institution which were most pressing . A rapidly increasing roll of students made more room absolutely necessary . The Legislature could see its way only to the appropriation of $100,000 where $250,000 seemed essential to a continuation of usefulness . No solution of the problem could be found . At last Governor Pillsbury modestly arose and said that he had long had the intention of doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency to erect a science hall at a cost of $150,000 and present it to the State . Private and sectarian institutions have received far greater gifts than this , but it is believed that the act has no parallel in the history of purely State educational institutions . However , munificent as was the gift of Pillsbury Hall , it sank into insignificance beside the gift of his own time and strength , which Governor Pillsbury spent so freely during the thirtyeight years of his service as regent . A very  |p694  conservative estimate , made by his friends , is that he devoted fully one-fourth of his time to the affairs of the institution . Let any business man consider what this means . Ten years of personal work 1 Have any of the millionaires who have generously given of their money for the public good done as much as this ? In his earlier career , Mr. Pillsbury , in addition to his work for the university , was in almost constant political service . Within a year after reaching St. Anthony , he began what proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From local service he went to the State Senate , in which body he sat almost continuously for thirteen years . So conspicuous were his services and his fitness for responsibility by this time , that in 1875 he was nominated and elected governor , without any effort upon his part or any of the usual accompaniments of candidacy and canvass . This was the beginning of six years in the gubernatorial chair , for he was accorded three terms ( the only Governor of Minnesota thus honored ) , and might have had a fourth had he not positively refused to serve again . It has never fallen to the lot of a Governor of Minnesota ( and possibly of any other State ) to be obliged to consider and handle so many diverse questions as arose during the incumbency of Governor Pillsbury . When he assumed office the socalled ' ' grasshopper plague " was becoming a serious matter . For several years Rocky Mountain locusts had been increasing in numbers in the southwestern part of the State , and all attempts at their extinction had proved futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread over the whole Northwest . It was characteristic of Governor Pillsbury that he went personally to the scene , investigated the extent of the calamity and the condition of the suffering people , and from his own means furnished relief in many cases . Returning to the State capital , he had facts of his own , which he laid before the Legislature with such force as to secure practical legislation looking to the aid of the people and the destruction of the pests . The latter proved , however , to be not easily accomplished . It was necessary to provide relief for several years , and Governor and Mrs. Pillsbury for weeks personally joined in the work of receiving and sorting contributions and packing them for the sufferers , ? again that idea of personal work which seems to have been one of Governor Pillsbury 's prominent traits . During his term as governor , Mr. Pillsbury recommended and secured the passage of some of the best laws on the statutes of Minnesota . Among these were acts providing for a public examiner , a State high-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . instead of annual meetings . He had an unusual number of appointments to make ? in the Supreme and District courts , and to other important offices ; he was obliged to face the destruc/ tion of the State capitol by fire , as well as a similar loss of the principal insane hospital of the State ; he was called upon to organize relief for the town of New Ulm , which was destroyed by a tornado near the close of his term . But the great work of his official life was his labor of removing from the name of Minnesota the stain of repudiation . Ill-advised legislation in the late fifties had led to the issue of over two million dollars ' worth of bonds for the encouragement of railroad-building in the State . The panic of 1857 prevented the completion of the railroads contemplated , and , exasperated by the situation , the people of the State voted to refuse payment of the obligations . For twenty years the reproach of repudiation had rested upon the State . The popular feeling which had led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject was still one tabooed by politicians and regarded as unsafe ground for any political party to consider . In his very first message , Governor Pillsbury urged the payment of these bonds ; and though met with indifference and violent opposition from many political leaders , he continued to demand that the honor of the State be preserved . At first he could count but a handful of men who supported his views . Sentiment gradually changed , and after overcoming the most tremendous obstacles in legislation and legal entanglement , Governor Pillsbury had the satisfaction , just before his term ended , of seeing the bonds matter adjusted and the word ? repudiation ? removed from association with the State which he had served so long . Entirely aside from ethical considerations , the bond settlement was of enormous value to Minnesota , for it made possible future financiering on much more favorable terms than were possible so long as the credit of the State carried this blot . It was Governor Pillsbury 's belief from the beginning that the majority of the people would approve of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his action was finally ratified . A man who had given ten years of his time to one public institution , and had served his State in as many other ways as did Governor Pillsbury , might well be excused from other gifts and beneficences . But he seems to have been continually giving . The extent of his charity and benefactions will never be known . In the greater portion of cases , the fact of assistance rendered was known only to the giver and the recipient . To only a few , even , is it known that a large number of young men have been helped through the University of Minnesota by the financial assistance of Governor Pillsbury . He always had a warns place in his heart for his native village of Sutton , N. H. , and some years ago he gratified a lifelong wish by building for that place a town hall as a memorial to his parents . Among his conspicuous gifts in Minneapolis were an endowment of $100,000 for the Home for Aged Women and Children , and the erection , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for young women working for small salaries , which was named , for his wife , the Mahala Fisk Pillsbury Home . Both these institutions had been the objects of Mrs. Pillsbury 's special attention , and the gifts were made jointly in the name of Governor and Mrs. Pillsbury . Each of these homes is of a most practical nature . Governor Pillsbury was one of those wise givers who wished to see his money well spent , and who had no time for charitable fads . And he did not encumber his gifts with conditions which might make their  |p696  administration difficult or impracticable . He had very clear views on such matters . Speaking to me one day of one of his projects , he said : Almost all these things are covered with conditions which make them inoperative . I do n't believe in giving money that way . I said , in this case , " Take it and do the best you can with it . " At the time of his death ? on October 18 ? he had well under way a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be a gift to the city of Minneapolis , and especially intended for the use of the people of the " East Side , " as that part of the city east of the Mississippi River is locally known . It is this section of the city which was the original " St. Anthony , " and where Governor Pillsbury first opened his store in 1855 , and where he had always lived . Only a few months ago , he told me the history of this plan of his . ' ' I have always had a great interest in the people of the East Side , " he said , simply . " There are people still living there ? working men and men of moderate means ? who were my neighbors when I first carne to St. Anthony . I have felt like doing all I could to benefit them . It was this idea of mine which led to building ' Pillsbury A Mill ' on the east side , while all the other mills are on the west side ; of the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I stood out for the East Side , and the mill was built where it would benefit East Side working men . It was then my idea to establish a library in connection with the ' A ' mill , and for the benefit of the employees ; but this project was never matured , and gradually I developed the plan of giving the East Side a library which would be suited to the needs of the whole people . Some of my friends do not like the site I have chosen , but I believe it is the best situated to serve the needs of the largest number . " The site in question is rather removed from the best residence portions of the East Side , but is central and very accessible for the class of people who most need library privileges . The delays incident to arranging for a rather elaborate building , and the sudden illness of the donor , interfered with the completion of this last of his great gifts ; but it is understood that his heirs will carry out the work on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts was to the State . It was a tract of one thousand acres near the headwaters of the Mississippi River , given to the State Forestry Board , and was the first donation under a new forestry law . It was evidently his intention , from a statement made at the time , to add largely to this tract at a later period , and he was known to feel the warmest sympathy for the plans for the conservation of the forests about the head-waters of the Mississippi . Governor Pillsbury 's services to his community were by no means confined to official endeavor or public or private benefactions . He took that part in the commercial development of his city and State which every good citizen should . Aside from being largely instrumental in building up the flour-milling and lumbering industries , he was a promoter of numerous enterprises which have taken a prominent part in the development of the resources of Minnesota . It was his privilege to see his State rise from a straggling group of frontier settlements to a population of 1,751,394 ; to see Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to see this city of his choice become the foremost flour and lumber manufacturing center of the world ; to see the agricultural industries of the Northwest expand until the States of Minnesota and North and South Dakota have well been named ' ' the bread - basket of the continent , " while the golden wheat has poured into the elevators of Minneapolis in such vast quantities as to make the city the leading wheat market of the globe ; to see a transportation system developed which stretches its long lines of rails across the western half of the continent to the Pacific harbors ; to see one of the most complete educational systems ever developed grow up in fifty years under the watchful care of the people ; and , more than all , to see the State University ? the apex of the system , and his own special pride ? grow from an empty building without students or teachers to a recognized position as one of the foremost educational institutions of the country , and with an enrollment of students rapidly approaching four thousand in number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he witnessed more of the progress of a wonderful community than falls to the lot of one in a thousand ; for he , was most intimately related to all this progress ? an actor in every scene of importance . Although his services to his community have not been equaled , they have been recognized only by the erection of the statue upon the campus of the university . But the monument to his great citizenship will not be wanting , for the words of the late Senator Cushman K. Davis were true . Standing in the midst of the beautiful group of university buildings , Senator Davis exclaimed , in closing his eloquent eulogy : " The true monument to Governor Pillsbury is in all that we see around us. "
