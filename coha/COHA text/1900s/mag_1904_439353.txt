MY friend , Antonio Ciccone , the eminent coufettatore of Little Italy , used often to invite me to put his picture in the paper . " You put peech in pape , " he would cry . " Beega peech ! Senda man , beega machine . You say , ' Antonio Ciccone , molto religioso , molto caritatevole , bests man . ' " And by this I know Antonio for a very perfect advertiser ? of that grandest type , the Homeric . He had the splendid Greek conception of the route to reputation ; instead of suffering the world to pronounce upon his merits , he would pronounce upon them himself . He no more craved to see himself as others saw him than did // Achilles ; like Achilles , he desired only that others might see him somewhat as he saw himself . Now I confess that I have loved Antonio for the boasts he has made . Many a man , finding himself no whit less great than that charming modern ancient of Little Italy , is nevertheless so grievously hemmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbs his pride in the staid habiliments of modesty . Such may be dear good souls , and fit for a thousand things , but they will play an ill hand at advertising . Let them learn from Ciccone ; also from my gifted fellow townsman , Mr. Joe Chapple , who , frank and unafraid , thus buoyantly declares himself in the public prints : ? " Do you know Joe Chapple , ? the boy who came out of the West almost penniless , and has built up a National magazine ? Do you know Joe Chapple , ? the man who gained his knowledge of human nature on the bumpers of freight trains ; trading an old gray horse for his first printing-press ; a printer 's devil at twelve , an editor at sixteen , ? through all phases of social life , up to an invited guest on presidential trains , and as special representative at the Coronation in Westinin- , ster Abbey ? Presidents , Members of the Cabinet , Supreme Court Judges , Diplomats , United States Senators , Congressmen , and Governors know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they write for his magazine when no other publication on earth can entice them . It is n't because Chapple is brilliant that he has won this national reputation for himself and his magazine , ? it ' s his quaint originality , his homelike , wholesome good-nature that permeates all he writes . There ' s nothing published to-day like The National Magazine ? because there is no one just like Joe Chapple . " Over and over I have conned that radiant advertisement , and my merriment , I own , has been not unmingled with envy . I have , perhaps , rather more discretion than Mr. Joe Chapple , but lessthan a tithe of his valor . Himself he sings , myself I dare not sing . And again I am put to shame by the illustrious English confectioner , who , having trodden the summits of conscious success , exclaims , " I am the Toffee King ! I have given to England a great national candy , and I am now offering to America the same Toffee that has made me so famous abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome a candy that is so pure that any mother can recommend it to her child ? The answer is , ' Yes , by all means ! ' " As further , though scarce clearer , evidence of the Homeric temper , both Mr. Chapple and the Toffee King have achieved the glowing ideal of Antonio Ciccone : they have " peech in page . " Yet I would not be misunderstood ; I bring no slenderest charge of vanity against those valiant modern Hellenes . Pasteur accepted learned degrees and decorations , not as honors to himself , but as tributes to his beloved France ; and thus devotedly , beyond doubt , do Mr. Chapple and the Toffee King lay their laurels upon the respective altars of their very worthy enterprises . For what work comes to its fullest and best in this faithless world of ours , if it be not haloed round with the splendor of a commanding personality ? The worker is or so men fancy ? the measure and the limit of the work . Magnify the worker , and in so doing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall find the producer acquiring what luminosity he can , that the product may thence take profit . Does he paint ? He capriciously dyes his white hair black , save one lock only , which he ties with a jaunty ribbon ; he hales unappreciative critics to court ; seeing a picture called Carnation , Lily ? Lily , Rose , he exclaims , " Darnation silly , silly pose , " ? a quotable saying , if you stop to think of it ; and the fame of that painter , going out through all the earth , adds to high art the fine resonance of personal 6 04 The Humors notoriety . Men laugh , but they buy . Has he a realm to rule , ? a realm made up of many petty kingdoms , each vain in its own conceit ? He declaims the mediaeval doctrine of " divine right , " . claps scoffers in jail , and ? thanks to a long-drawn process of audacious and fantastic meddling with literature , art , music , the drama , surgery , yachting , and theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomparably the most talked-of individual in all his empire . Men laugh , but they yield . Has he books to sell ? Assuming the cast mantle of a famous craftsman , the name of a jovial monk , the unshorn locks of a poet , and the tripod of an oracle , he preaches a new and strange gospel , and with unquestionable good taste permits the portrait of his son , " food , principally grape-nuts , " to be printed as an advertisement , which , of course , is just what Frit Pandolf , or the elder Kean , or the Cumman Sibyl , or the lamented William Morris himself would have done . Men laugh , but they buy . There ' s money in personality , be it never so whimsical , and to that blazing star the commercial go-cart may very prudently be hitched . Madame Yale , the brilliant lecturer ; Max Regis , the bold , bad duelist ; John Alexander Dowie , the reincarnated prophet , ? these and a thousand others have grasped the blessed truth that personal publicity can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecuniary success . " Peech in pape " is pelf in purse . And yet , for obvious reasons , the most delicious type of personal advertising , the matrimonial , unfortunately denies the " pape " the " peech . " Oh , for a single photographic glimpse of the little lady of Yokohama who thus lyrically declares herself : ? " I am a beautiful woman . My abundant , undulating hair envelopes me as a cloud . Supple as a willow is my waist . Soft and brilliant is my visage as the satin of the flowers . I am endowed with wealth sufficient to saunter through life of Advertisiug. hand in hand with my beloved . Were I to meet a gracious lord , kindly , intelligent , well educated , and of good taste , I would unite myself with him for life , and later share with him the pleasure of being laid to rest eternal in a tomb of pink marble . " But methinks ? and this I say because I have seen the hill-town folk of New England elaborately gulled through nibbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wee trifle less charming in person than in pretense . Great Homer nods , at times ; also the Homeric advertiser . But to brandish testimonials , with portraits of important witnesses , and thus to " let another praise thee and not thine own mouth , " is ingeniously to remove the discussion from the Homeric , or poetic , to the Aristotelian , or logical , realm . One 's " loving friends " ? for , and in consideration of , value received ? stand forth as witnesses . When Mr. W. T. Stead , fresh from his advocacy of Mr. Wilde the astrologer , proclaims Mr. Pelman , the mender of memories , a noble " benefactor of the human race , " or when a " cousin of Win . J. Bryan " proves , by the healthful lustre of his photograph , that Tierney 's Tiny Tablets have made him whole , the great purpose is quite satisfactorily attained , and meanwhile Citizens Pelman , Wilde , and Tierney have lost nothing of their reputation for modest stillness and humility . This ingenious cat's-paw device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quote a single commodity , the sale of proprietary medicines is directly proportionate to the quantity and blatancy of the advertising they get , which proves the effectiveness of testimonials to a nicety . Moreover ? and this , I grieve to say , is a point most advertisers overlook ? the testimonial admits of almost infinite adaptation . For instance , when President Harper , in an admirably sane and tempered address , observes that students successfully prepared for college by correspondence in- stitutes are invariably possessed of courage and application , that deliverance of his is jubilantly pounced upon by a dozen correspondence schools of the baser sort ( imagine an institution , which , in crying up its course in the art of conversation , says , " You admire the party who you hear spoken of as ' Do n't he use elegant language ? ' " ) , and , by a skillful derangement of context , the original dictum becomes President Harper 's avowal that nothing short of pedagogical absent treatment can possibly inculcate courage and application ! And when an insatiable moral reformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain vaudeville theatre " absolutely above reproach , ? clean , wholesome , uplifting , " the theatrical proprietor , with a delicate appreciation of commercial values , had the reformer 's benediction quite exquisitely engrossed and framed and hung up in the foyer of his theatre ; and from that very day diverged from the paths of rectitude . Truly a blithe situation : within , a jubilee of vanities , ? without , a certificate of ethical impeccability 1 And again , I have seen a reverend apostle of temperance mischievously trapped into indorsing a patent medicine chiefly compounded of spirits of wine . Indeed , this whole business of sponsoring other men 's goods should be carefully marked with bell-buoys , which night and day should cry , " Shoal ? ' ware shoal ! " But I find that a printed testimonial , even when got by fair means and employed with good conscience , nevertheless lacks the convincing fervor of viva voce pleadings . And the spoken word , to persuade , need not fully convince . I think it was Sainte-Beuve who said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does a better thing ; it charms . " And the Lacordaire of advertising is the sweetly persuasive " barker . " When such an one cries , " Right inside , gepmen ? see the royal Bengal tiger ? fifteen feet from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail ? fifteen feet from the tip of his tail to the tip of his nose ? making in all the e-normious length of forty feet ? only ten cents , gepmen , the tenth part of a dollar , " I tarry not long at the gate . But when , on the other hand , a uniformed Ethiopian ? barking not gently , as befits so tender a matter , but brazenly , bluntly , and without joy in his barking ? hales me into Black 's Dental Parlors , I can not overmaster a certain vague shrinking of spirit . The appeal lacks charm , whereas even forceps and rubber dam may , by a subtler and more delicate order of barking , be made absolutely alluring . In England , where this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentist secretly hires a viscount to commend him to his friends , thus adorning the abhorred service with the dignity of illustrious patronage and the seductiveness of sympathetic suggestion ; for a viscount will bark you as gently as any sucking dove . Sometimes , however , you may drive squarely at the point , and , without recourse to self-laudation or purchased praises , offer the susceptible public a tempting taste of your wares . This , the empirical method , jumps with the modern scientific tendency . Ethically , also , it unfailingly commends itself , for " Sample bottle free " bespeaks plain dealing . Nor is this all . The open cages of the circus parade will most exquisitely tantalize the zoological passions ; and appetizing extracts , gratuitously published , whet interest in a forthcoming work of humor . Thus I read , " We ' re an honest people , ' said Mr. Hennessy . We are , ' said Mr. Dooley , ' but we do n't know it ; ' " or again , " Once upon a time there was a Brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strangers usually mistook him for a Tramp . Every Evening he ate an imitation Dinner , at a forty-cent Table d'Hdte , with a Bottle of Writing Fluid thrown in , " ? and two new volumes ( without which no gentleman 's library is complete ) appear forthwith upon my 606 The Humors of Advertising . bookshelf . When Artemus Ward , then wholly unknown , papered Boston with handbills , which , without mention of time or place , said simply , " A. Ward Will Speak a Piece , " and when , later in his career , his poster proclaimed " A. WARD HAS LECTURED BEFORE THE CROWNED HEADS OF EUROPE ever thought of lecturing , " he gave , so to speak , an earnest of levity . Out in Cleveland , the curator of an historical museum , calling my attention to an antiquated desk and chair , said , " Those pieces of furniture , sir , once belonged to Charles Browne , known to the world as Artemus Ward . Lacked balance ! " So he did ? thank God ! ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sublime ' t is many a step , and it is not without a momentary shock to my finer sensibilities that I find the solemn and awful melodrama of " Red-Handed Bill , the Hair Lifter of the Far South-West " adapting to its blood-curdling purposes the frivolous advertising methods invented by an " exhibitor of fine waxworks and 3 moral bears . " The promoter of melodrama publishes a synopsis of the impending " sensational representation , " thus scattering , as it were , a largess of shudders , which , for generosity at least , fully equals Ward 's largess of laughter . Read here the synopsis , and tremble ! " Act I. A Mountain Pass in the Rockies . In pursuit . Kate saved by the Cattle King . The assault of Red-Handed Bill and his Brazen Bandits . Avaunt !

" And , as if this were not enough , the promoter of melodramas declares that " the breakage of costly bricabrac during the fight in the Bucket of Blood Saloon makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some companies . " In advertising wild animal shows , where one 's animals are too few to permit the open-cage extravagance , and the admission fee outweighs a barker 's persuasiveness , still creepier pronunciarnentos are desirable . You remember Mr. Janvier 's story , A Consolate Giantess , and how the lady ? widowed , again widowed , and then widowed twice more , and for the fourth time remarried ? cried , " Alt if our Neron would again eat a man ! " When at last the good Giantess could announce " the terrible man-eating lion , Neron , who has devoured five men , " all was indeed well . In fact , in enterprises of this character , no other sort of advertising will long serve . When Bostock 's animal show first came to the Pan-American Exposition , its passionate press agent inserted a " want " in the Buffalo papers , shrieking for " fifty mules , quick , to feed the lions . " This drew its thousands . Whereupon the press agent , quite losing his head , advertised for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was thereupon discharged . Which teaches us how perilous is any departure from the classic , which is the sanguinary , or pseudo-sanguinary , method of crying up menageries. // But , however effectual the sample bottle , the sample joke , and the sample shudder , I can show you a yet more excellent device . Depreciate your wares . Learn from the Tennessee innkeeper who described his establishment as " not the largest hotel in the burg ; not newly furnished throughout ; no free ' bus to trains ; not the best grub the market affords ; but simply clean beds and good food . 25 cents a sleep , 25 cents an eat . Toothpicks and ice water thrown in . Try us ! Pay up ! And if not satisfied keep mum . " Or emulate the New Jersey husbandman who declared , " Owing to ill health , I will sell one blush raspberry cow , aged eight years . She is of undaunted courage and gives milk freely . To a man who does not fear death in any form , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a non-resident of the county . " Or again , wisely imitate the New York tapster who set above his door the superscription , " Road to Hell . " By thus quietly assuming that success can in no wise be scared off the premises , you shall certainly outvie your loud-boasting competitors . Besides , you will deal exclusively with men of valor , which , in these soft times , is a rare enough privilege . Do you lack the fortitude to denounce your wares ? There are those who will cheerfully relieve you of that responsibility . Forbid them not . Detraction has proved a Golconda to Mr. Richard Harding Davis . " Near-food " sells faster , and the " Dope-Lovers ' Library " gains new subscribers , as a result of Mr. Dooley 's merry jibes . Life , condemning the automobile in a hundred cartoons , becomes an incomparable advertising medium for the most homicidal of motor-vehicles . Many a public man would give his weight in radium for a " roast " in the New York Sun . To be talked about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little whether the talk be kind or cruet P. T. Barnum appreciated this when , without the faintest intention of carrying out the fearful threat , he let it be whispered that he was about to buy Shakespeare 's house and bundle it off to America . " Shameless desecration ! " howled the press , ? which was precisely what Barnum wanted . Without spending a dollar , he secured hundreds of " reading notices , " in " first-class position , " and focused the lively attention of every English or American reader upon himself and his business . And if it takes grit to invite abuse , why , bless you , so does all good advertising . Only an unconquerable soul will write upon his finished product , " I consider this magazine absolutely perfect ; had I spent a million dollars , I could not have achieved anything more splendid . " For we have here , you see , the didactic ? ' ad , " in which the advertiser , fearlessly exalting himself above his public , tells it what ' s what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you eat , you are . Be wise in time . " And many a self-appointed arbiter of taste announces a full line of " art " chairs , " art " glass , " art " bicycles , and I know not what other objets d'art , ? " art " catalogue free on application . Nor could Ruskin , even in his most autocratic mood , have rivaled the proprietor of the frying-pan clock , who pronounces , with an air of sublime finality , " The keynote of modern interior decoration is simplicity ? be sure you strike it when you furnish your den . ' One of the most pleasing and interesting adornments for your den ' is our Frying-Pan Clock . Made from a real frying-pan . Bow of ribbon , any color . " Here , I observe , is a very brave man , and the brave , you will find , have ever at their heels a train of timid folk , who relish commands . It is sweet to obey , sweet to obey without question . Dogma , tradition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , philosophies , and governments ; what wonder , then , that when the valiant didactic advertiser essays to lead the world by the nose , space bristles with willing noses I And yet I can show you another law , the law called protest , which , though rarer , plays a part not less significant than that taken by obedience . Rome has its Luther , philosophy its Hume , government its Emma Goldman , the didactic " ad " its brood of unconvinced recalcitrants . Problem : to wheedle such . Now a well-pleased man yields soonest to coaxing . And it happens that pleasure awakened by an utterly irrelevant matter sheds its radiance over the business in hand . Many a wight gets monstrously cheated by sealing a bargain at dinner . Indeed , I remember a charming Bohemian caf ? where I myself was once thus undone . The soft glow of the lights , the scores of merry faces , the tinkle of a tiny orchestra , and the courses of dainties on dainties , ? these argued nothing , yet argued all . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rural districts a show does as well as a dinner . Hence the " medicine company , " with its ingenious employment of music and the drama to create an atmosphere in which proprietary remedies , heartily eulogized by a lecturer , will sell to advantage . They say the medicine company has seen its day . Believe them not . The New York Clipper still chronicles its triumphs : witness this cheerful report by Dr. Wood Leigh . " I opened my Winter Medicine Show in Illinois , Oct. 3 , carrying five people , and the show is taking big . Dick Doble , in song and dance , is a success ; Mme. Leigh , in serpentine dances , was a strong feature . Had to stop taking money at the door at 7.40 on her night . Walter Whitley in contortion , rings and traps , hit them right ; Will May , descriptive singer and monologue , was excellent . " Also the following : " Roster and Notes from the German Medicine Co . ? Joe Sower , manager ; William Herbert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contortionist ; Prof. F. E Miller , spirit cabinet , handcuff act and silly kid piano player ; Joe Sower , Irish and Dutch act ; Mrs. Sower , treasurer , and Baby Pauline , ballads . Wo play to S. R. 0 . nightly . " Here , then , you behold the Muses Nine conspiring with Eseulapies in a device known to ethical philosophers as the Little Game . Failing dinners and shows ? which , alas , conic high ! ? the Little Game takes the less costly form of humor . And , from the economic viewpoint , it waives the implied paradox and takes its humor seriously . A joke may find him who a sermon flies ; for the mirthful advertisement outflanks logic by creating a milieu hypnotically conducive to commercial exchange . Truly , were Sunny Jim to convert the nine gowned justices , stern reasoners though they be , into regular purchasers of Force , I should not so much as blink ; for Force is a jovial name . Uneeda Biscuit become only the more negotiable under so whimsical a sobriquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulator , and capillature abridger , " gets trade in plenty . So does the London publican , who calls his inn " The Swallow . " There ' s a mischievous winsomeness , too , in the Preacher Cigar , the Three Nuns Cigarettes , and ? save the mark ! ? St. Mary 's Distillery . So it comes about that whoso hits on a clever name sits exalted among the gods of his personal Pantheon . But a most obliging divinity I find him , and ever ready to disclose the intellectual processes whereby he achieved his triumph . Poe has told how he wrote The Raven , Kipling , how he composed his Recessional ; and with equal appropriateness the rat-poison man consents to lay bare his heart . Having traced the conception and realization of a great hope , he comes at last to the question of nomenclature . " That was the rub . I wrestled with that problem for several days and nights . One night , after working over it till well-nigh morning , I got tired and gave it up . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Humors ever I call it in the end , it certainly is " Rough on Rats . " ' It struck me like a flash ? that this expression was the winning name , and in ten minutes I was out on the floor , executing a war dance to the refrain , ' Rats , Rats , Rough on Rats , Hang Your Dogs , and Drown Your Cats . ' " Dear , good Mother Eddy , it seems , had a somewhat similar experience . " Six weeks , " she declares , " I waited on God to suggest a name for the book I had been writing . Its title , Science and Health , came to me in the silence of the night , when the steadfast stars watched over the world ? when slumber had fled ? and I rose and recorded the hallowed suggestion . The following day I showed it to my literary friends , who advised me to drop both the book and , the title . To this , however , I gave no heed . " Thus it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnificent when viewed from the standpoint of its author . And , after all , the jester should of right be merrier than his merriest jests , ? or , at least , when one comes to think of it , such is generally the case , ? and a defenseless world must learn to make the best of it . To subject a humorous advertisement to cold criticism is to spoil the fun . The real jocularity is not in the advertisement , but in the advertiser . The photographer who exclaims , " Bring on your dear little babies ; if they do n't sit still I wo n't get mad , for I was a baby once myself , " is funnier than his advertisement . When I read , I chuckle . Is the rhyme , then , so clever ? No , I can quote you a whole anthology of infinitely wittier jingles . But a razor , which none but the bearded contemplate without a shudder , or handle without grave solicitude , suggests a train of thought moving , let no say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetical a temper as that here manifest suggests a train of thought moving , let // // us say , from south to north . Presto , collision ! And I laugh , not because the two trains meet , to the well-deserved damage of their dignity , but rather because the smash is transparently premeditated ; which bespeaks jocularity where least expected . Likewise I treasure the spirited lines : This , I have sometimes dared think , almost equals the German professor 's prescription of an infallible test for the temperature of the baby 's bath : " Put the baby in the water ; if he turns red , it ' s too warm ; if he turns blue , it ' s too cold . " For the notion of a woolly little lamb put sorrowfully to bed in a washtub appeals quite powerfully to one 's sense of the pathetic , and pathos adds ever a certain wicked zest to the humorous . And yet the fine flavor of this quaint advertisement lies chiefly , I think , in the unexpected oddity wherewith a most respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soap trade . Twist and distort the familiar , till art-for-art's-sake becomes **26;160;TOOLONG , and you perpetrate a highly jovial crime . Thus a facsimile of the cover design of Confessions of a Wife attracts my vagrant eye to what looks for all the world like an extract from that most delirious of novels : " To-morrow is our wedding day , and I have a surprise for Dana .. .. I can see him sometimes looking wistfully at his soiled left hand . . .. Dana has grown so patient and gentle that it frightens me . . . . When he swears and throws the soap around the room my spirits are quite good ? it is not natural for Dana to be patient . .. . Cleanliness has its price as well as love , 610 T lie Humors of Advertising . and it seems as if in this struggle with common soaps lie paid the cost of his cleanliness from the treasury of his life . . . . I have got a cake of Hand Sapolio for Dana . " These charming parodies seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fine a geniality , that I find myself quite amiably disposed toward the advertisers who have put them forth . ' this is what the advertisers wanted , and I perceive , not without a modicum of personal satisfaction , that verily they have their reward . They deserve it . For art is long , and successful humor the longest and toughest of arts . I have known many jokers , but few jokes . And so I am hardly surprised to find a distinguished authority counseling advertisers to walk wide of the jocose advertisement . Says he , " The man who has no sense of humor can never see the point of a humorous ad , while there is every reason for believing that the man who has a sense of humor is connoisseur enough to select choicer food for it than that afforded in the humorous ad . " But jocosity will out , and the comic advertisement has come to stay . And as humor is rare , especially in America ( for what other nation in Christendom would relish Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with notorious success and unquestioned profit , to the humor of the humorless . Watch the passengers in the trolley car . They are delightedly absorbing its frieze of obvious comicalities , and with my hand on my heart I declare there never were more fatuous jingles , never more vapid absurdities , never more limping attempts at wit . This is just as it should be . For a single disgruntled beholder ? like yourself , gentle reader ? there are thousands on thousands who proudly imagine themselves amused . " Humor , " says Mr. Crothers , " is the frank enjoyment of the imperfect . " Yes , but not of imperfect fun . And I find the advertiser most deliciously amusing when he least aspires to be ; I frankly enjoy his laughterless and unconscious imperfections . " Miss Ellen Terry will positively appear in three pieces , " writes he ; or " Try our patent lamp-chimney and save half your light ; " or even , " Our fish can not be approached . " A correspondence school of advertising declares in its enthusiastic prospectus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall-flower in society ; " and , good lack , why should he ? I will pledge my all to find admirers for any author of unwittingly humorous advertisements . Indeed , I dare say Mr. Crothers himself would be proud to fellowship with such an one , and " frankly enjoy his imperfections , " though methinks he would perhaps reserve the right to order his own affairs without assistance from so devious and humorless an intellect . I recall a noted clergyman who , when promoting the American lectures of a touring British dean , sought counsel of a professional advertiser . " Get a strong list of patronesses , " said his confident Mentor , " and I ' 11 do the rest . " So the churchman spent some seven laborious ( lays ringing just the right doorbells , and thus secured the sponsorship of the good and great . The advertiser spent seven days , also , contriving a suitable sensation . Without waiting on clerical approval ? for what do the clergy know of these mundane matters ? ? he posted ten thousand circulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each superscribed in monstrous letters ( as befitted the intellectual dimensions of the roverend lecturer ) The touring dean , like the king in the ancient chronicle , waxed " wonderly wroth ; " so did the fashionable patronesses ; so , in consequence , did the trustful clergyman , who for many a day had to hide his light under a bushel . But the // advertising specialist stood by his gulls . He had brought the dean 's lecture to a happy issue , packed the auditorium , minted a snug and glittering little fortune . For his well-aimed gaucherie had set the whole town babbling , and the social cataclysm and its resultant uproar had converted the hideous proclamation into that best of advertisements , the self-repeater . When I turn advertiser , I shall venture on nothing but self-repeaters . I shall uniformly advertise my deans after that perilous but remunerative fashion ; indeed , I shall even emulate the Girl with the Auburn Hair , from whom I one clay received a very pretty missive , which , written in a delicate feminine hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAR MR . HARTT , ? As I never asked a favor of you before in all my life , I feel free to ask one now . Please have the goodness to meet me at the stage entrance of Shea 's Garden Theatre at eight o'clock any evening next week . Wear a pink carnation in your buttonhole , so I shall know you . Do n't tell any one except your wife and family . Sincerely yours , THE GIRL WITH THE AUBURN HAIR . As every man in town , or at least every man in the address book , had been honored with a similar brochure , just imagine the hubbub ! I am not aware that innumerable multitudes assembled , carnation-bedecked , at the stage entrance of Shea 's Garden Theatre , but I have it for truth that the Girl with the Auburn Hair sang to vast and highly expectant audiences . She had made every man of us her herald . And so it chances that many a commercial proclamation leaps from the advertising column to the realm of popular humor , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will laugh at the merest mention of Heinz 's pickles or Dr. Munyon 's inhaler . In A Chinese Honeymoon , Miss Toby Claude , with a marvelous horizontal pigtail , becomes , in the lines assigned to the leading comedian , " Sunny Jim 's sister , " ? and the joke , so profitable to the manufacturers of Force , brings a burst of uncontrollable merriment . A newspaper jokesmith contrives that Mrs. McBride shall say , " I ca n't coax my husband to eat any breakfast ; " to which Mrs. Oldwife rejoins , " Have you tried Force ? " Whereupon Mrs. McBride exclaims , " Madam , you do n't know my husband ! " All my advertisements , I have determined , must thus reverberate . Better yet , I am fixed upon it that whenever possible , they shall go capped and gowned in academic dignity . I remember a little affair that occurred some years ago at a venerable New England College . It was Commencement Day . A brilliant audience had assembled . On the platform sat the distinguished Faculty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orators had successively striven for appreciation , till at last appeared the putative candidate for the prize " for the best appearance on the Commencement stage . " A handsome lad lie was , and a really impressive figure as he strode across the platform in his flowing Oxford gown . He bowed smilingly , and then said with radiant amiability , " Good - morning ! Have you used Pears ' Soap ? " With that he paused ? seconds , but hours it seemed ? while a shudder of scandalized horror ran through us all . I could have sunk into the very depths of the earth . The learned Faculty were beside themselves with mingled rage and mortification . The audience gasped . But after the dreadful pause came the ringing exclamation , " This is the advertisement that stares us in the face , turn where we will ! Do you read the advertisements in the daily papers ? You ought to . " And then followed an do- 612 The Humors of Advertising . quent address on the Economics of Advertising , ? an address so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardor and measure , that the terrible youth covered himself with honor , and triumphantly bore away the prize . There you had a self - repeater worth talking about . Such , then , as I view these pleasant interests , are the humors of advertising . I am advised , however , that some , Charles Dickens among them , prescribe an attitude less frivolous than mine toward so solemn a thing as the printed advertisement . Says Dickens , " The advertisements which appear in a public journal take rank among the most significant indications of the state of society of that time and place . " Which is literally true of this singular brochure in the Dyersburg , Tennessee , Gazette : LOST ? A HOUSE . " On Tuesday , March 16 , my dwelling-house , thirteen miles above Caruthersville , was washed from its foundation and floated down the Mississippi River . It is a new two-story frame , painted white and built in ' I ' shape , with a hall in the centre , and a two-story front porch all the way across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , including an organ with J. C. engraved on the plate . The cook stove is an old-fashion No. 8 range . A Marlin rifle , sixteen-shot , 38-calibre , was also in the house . Any one knowing the whereabouts of this house will be rewarded by informing use at this place . " Here , beyond doubt , you have an accurate picture of life in Dyersburg , Tennessee . The advertisement thus becomes material for the sociologist , and if this be sociology let us make the most of it ! " The most truthful part of a newspaper , " says Thomas Jefferson , " is theadvertisements . " When , therefore , I I read , " Come and see the Human Suicide : he kills himself every fifteen minutes , " or " A bottle of Italian air ( price one dollar ) will snake you sing like Patti in her early days , " I have doubtless enlarged my personal sapiency by peacefully annexing an indisputable fact . Nevertheless , so ill-poised is my solemnity that , even when thus handsomely enriched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet a kindly laugh it is , ? with charity for all , and with malice toward none . Indeed , he were a sail sort of Christian , who , stalking abroad through the sunny realm of public advertising , could fail to be warmed by its humors . For , despite their conscious or unconscious grotesquerie , they bespeak the Pauline virtues of faith , hope , and love : faiths in the omnipotence of the advertisement ; hope writ large in a splendid commercial optimism ; love , singing ever of noble disinterestedness . And the greatest of E ) these is love . Fortunes in mining stocks , health and long life in unfailing pills and potions , wisdom by snail or in packages of breakfast food , the trappings of splendor for only a tithe of their value , ? these , and a hundred other precious things ; are fairly pelted at a beloved public , to the apparent ruin of its benefactors . Even the advertising of this vast and profoundly altruistic sacrifice costs millions of dollars . And the pretty point of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which an approving Providence beholds their self-forgetfulness , get rich in the process . Moreover , it is sweet to know that , in the last analysis , it is my money and yours that they fatten on , and , by virtue of increased prices , my money and yours that pays for their extravagant advertising ? which , methinks , is the best joke of all .
