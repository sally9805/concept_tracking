txt deleted 2 paragraphs As told in THE TIMES yesterday , Mr. Heinze has been overwhelmed with offers of financial assistance upon the security of his copper stocks , the United , the Davis-Daly , and the Ohio , principally , and it now develops that the sum of these offers of loans in the last four or fire months is in the neighborhood of $2,000 , e00 . It was this experience that made Mr. Joyce , who borrowed tile $50,000 , figuring in the present cafe on his own account , to insist upon the conditions that led to the uncovering of the whole transaction . Among those with whom Heinze has had loan transactions that have not deleted 1 line Gustav Nassauer of 27 William Street , on whose behalf a broker approached the Heinzes last May with an offer of about $21,000 . The Heinzes understood that Mr , Nassauer was the principal in this transaction , even up to the time when they received his checks on the Carnegie Trust Company for $23,000 and $6,000. into which sums the total Joan was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said by a representative of the Heinzes yesterday , the condition was made , and stipulated in an agreement supplemeotal to the loan contract , that . the identical certificates that went up as collateral should be returned upon the discharge of the ? Legation . A Queer Loan Transaction . But here , as in the case of the Joyce loan , the stock began to come back again the very day after the loan was Wads , and the Heinze brokers had the Pleasure of buying back the collateral their principal had put up to raise money to support the market they were making . Explanation was sought from Nassauer , and according to the version given last night by a Heinze representative that gentleman said that ne had acted not for himself , but for an undisclosed principal who had notified him to go to the Carnegie Trust Company , where he would find a deposit in his name of a sufficient amount to cover the transaction . Nassauer went to the trust company , according to the story that the Heinzes received , found a passbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check for this amount , delivered the check , got the collateral , and left it at th trust company and then considered the matter at an end . So far as the Joyce loan was concerned in yesterday 's developments , the complete history cf the transaction from the time that young Persch approached Sherwood to the time that four Curb brokerage houses sold the collateral on Persch 's ' orders , became known . Young Persch himself , as a matter of fact , has had his experiences with the police before now . - Once he was arrested in coar.ection with certain checks that he had floated , and once again after be had interested himself in the collections for ean ice fund that was being managed by an evening newspaper . On both of these cases matters were eventually straightened out to the satisfaction of all parties and Persch VHS released . He was taken to the District Attor-1 ney 's office early yesterday morning , and Detective Fitzsimmons took in there also Sherwood , who so far as had been learned the nignt before was a clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lender with the Windsor Trust Company , and also took out of the trust company the collateral that was sold . Assistant District Attorney Nott had had a talk with Persch the night before , but without much result , and yesterday morning when Persch was brought to his office the young man also refused to talk , upon the advice of his counsel . Sherwood Got 550,000 Easily . With Sherwood , however , it was different . He was quite ready to talk , and said that Persch had come to him representing that he had a large block of Davis-Daly and Ohio Copper stock in the Windsor Trust Company , and wanted to get it out . To do this he said , according to Sherwood , that he needed *50,000 , and if Sherwood could get it for him would pay as a commission 10 per cent . on the proceeds of the sales of the collateral in excess of the $50,000 . Sherwood at this time , according to his story Yesterday , had left the employ of the Field firm , although he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young asked for the $50,000 , and got It . Thus armed and introduced be , Richard Kauffman , who declared that the real lender was Charles Katz , Sherwood went to the Windsor Trust Company . Kauffman also brought to the trust company W. J. Clark , the loan broker who ap-proadeed Mr. Joyce and represente that he- could raise $50,000 on the co dpper stock successfully , and in this connection it Was learned yesterday that Mr. Nett ' wants to find out a good deal more as to how Clark happened to go to Joyce wanting to get him money on Davis-Daly and Ohio Copper collateral at just about the time ' when Persch was making his arrangements with Sherwood to get ' his " securities out of the Windsor Trust Company . From Sherwood also Mr. Nott obtained Yesterday the original order signed by Persch directing him to get the collateral from the trust company . This read : Kindly receive 15.000 shares of Ohio Copper and 4,000 shares of Davis-Daly from the Windsor Trust Company and pay $50.000 for the same . D. PERSCH . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence its phraseology corresponded closely to the representations that were made to Field &; Co . The accuracy of the/information portrayed in the note , as to the particular securities which were subsequently delivered by Joyce to the trust company , is another thing which Mr. Nott thinks that Clark will have event sally to explain . There are also several points in the loan transaction itself in regard to which Mr. Nott believes the Windsor Trust Company might well make a more detailed explanation than any that has-been vouchsafed by that coporation or its counsel thus far . One of these points was raised by the . statement of Sherwood yesterday that when Joyce was at the trust company talking with Stirling Birmingham , who acted as the trust company 's load clerk , he ( Sherwood ) was sitting in a room near the one where Joyce and Birmingham were talking . Sherwood declared that Birmingham told Joyce he would have to take his certificates of stock to the loan expert of the trust company for inspection as to the regularity of their indorsements , and thereupon brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire lot to which Sherwood took exception , and these nine were taken to the Stock Exchange house of Schumacher , Bates &; Co. for indorsing in the proper form , and then returned . This was all on Aug. 2 , and Mr. Nott is still at a loss to understand why Birmingham should have taken the certificates to Sherwood as the " loan expert " of the trust company . Nor does Mr. Nett understand the surrender of the certificates by the trust company to Sherwood immediately upon the execution of the loan on Aug. 2 . " It looks as though the trust company were playing the old game of Box and Cox , " said Mr. Nott . When Stephen Brooks Rosenthal of Levy , Rosenthal &; Hermance , counsel for Heinze , was asked about this phase or the situation yesterday he said : You may depend upon it that we shall hold the trust company responsible for the return of our collateral . It was with a view to such action that we tendered payment of the loan in full with interest last Saturday noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sherwood 's story to Mr. Nott yesterday morning ran to still other interesting details . He produced an order from Persch to sell the Davis-Daly and Ohio Copper , which read as follows : Aug. 2. deleted paragraph Upon this order Sherwood sold the stock through five curb firms . These firms are : Straus &; Co. of 20 Broad Street , John Thomas . Reinhart of 30 Broad Street , Bonnel &; Steinberg of : 25 Broad Street , A. J. Kohn of 25 Broad Street , and Charles Woerman of 30 Broad Street . The stock brought about $06,000 , of ' which $1,500'was retained by Sher wood as commission and the balance turned over to Persch , after deducting $300 , charged by Field &; Co. , for the accommodation of the $50,000 on which the whop. transaction was arranged . When Sherwood had finished his story Persch was called before Mr. Nott and asked once more if he did n't want to talk ? Persch said he did not . ' " If you do n't answer I shall have to direct your arrest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon the advice of his counsel . Then Mr. Nott directed that Detective Fitzsimmons make put a short affidavit phargirtg.grand cehy and Persch was taken down stairs before Magistrate Corrigan . Mr. Nott said it had been agreed that the examination of Persch should conic at 10:30 o'clock Friday morning . He suggested heavy bail for the prisoner . Persch 's counsel , Alexander Carlin , said that he could raise $15,000 , but no more , and asked that this amount be fixed . Mr. Nott objected . There are powerful people behind this nian , " he raid , " and they will furnish almost any bail that is asked rather than have this man tell what he knows . " Mr. Carlin denied that Persch could furnish more than $25,000 bail , and Mr. Nott retorted that on Aug. 6 Persch had $45,000 realized on the stock sale . When arrested yesterday , as a matter of fact , he had checks aggregating about $42,000 , which were taken as evidence of the fraudulent sales of ' stock . Magistrate Corrigan finally agreed to $50,000 bail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which time Persch , still being unable to furnish bail , was committed to the Tombs . Later in the afternoon Persch 's counsel applied to Supreme Court Justice Lehman for a writ of habeas corpus , but the Justice denied an immediate writ and set down the matter for argument this morning . Mr. Nott examined yesterday , besides Sherwood , Charles Katz , Leonard Field , M. M. Joyce , and several other witnesses , District Attorney Jerome being around during part of the time . From these witnesses Mr. Nott gleaned a good deal of important information . Henry Inman , manager of the brewery of which Katz is President , said that Persch came to him and asked him to make out his note for $50,000 to be used in connection with the original procurement of the $00,000 . This Ulman did , and was to receive $266 for his courtesy , only the note was never delivered , as Leonard Field let Sherwood have the money without any security until the stock taken out of the Windsor Trust Company arrived . Field was asked yesterday why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and wanted to help him out . A further question was put to him whether it was not unusual to let any one have $50,000 without any security . Oh , " he said , ' I was protected in the matter . " Mr. Joyce was particularly insistent as to the understanding he had with the Windsor Trust Company . He declared , furthermore , that after this loan had been made , J. D. Blair , who makes his office with Joyce &; Co. , was offered by Clark another $50,000 , with the explanation that the Windsor Trust Company was the lender . By way of reply to the assertions of President Young of the Windsor Trust , in a statement given out Monday night that Mr. Joyce knew that the trust company was only an agent in the loan deal , Mr. Joyce said yesterday ' I would ask if . as Mr. Young states , the Windsor Trust Company carried the transaction as an agent only , why was ( -1 not apprised of this fact ? Why was I required to open an account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windsor Trust Company , as consideration for the loan , ' insist that I keep an average balance of from $6,000 to $10,000 ? Why was I introduced by Mr. Birmingham to Mr. Ford , the Vice President , as " Mr. JoYce , the gentleman with whom we have Just closed that loan " Why was my account opened by Mr. Ford without any reference or any further investigation than the aforesaid introduction by Mr. Birmingham ? Why , If this was only an agency transaction , did Mr. Birmingham leave the room to submit to Mr. Ford my suggestion that the note be changed so as to permit me to pay off the principal before maturity on payment of interest in full ? Why , If not to allay any fears I might have possibly had , was I told in explicit detail that Mr. Young , the President , had approved the loan , had passed on the form of the note , and that the same could not be varied ? Why , when I asked for a receipt for my certificates , was I told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give receipts for collateral ? Why , on Friday , Aug. 6 , after my certificates ... were sold ; was I told , in the presence of J. D. Blair , that the Windsor Trust Company had made the loan Ito me , that I was to look to them for my collateral , and-that they still had it ? And , finally , I ask , is it reasonable to suppose that I or any other sane man would deposit over $100,000 worth of collateral with an undisclosed principal who might be absolutely irresponsible and possibly dis-honest ? Mr. Nott will continue his investigation to-day . It - is hoped in the District Attorney 's office that after young Persch has been in confinement for twenty-four hours he may become more talkative , always provided that there is some man " higher ' up " In the copper stock loan deal .
