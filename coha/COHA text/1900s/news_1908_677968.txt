txt Why Taxes Are High . Last Saturday morning a gang of seven men , with horse and wagon and several ladders and other implements , made their appearance in 141st Street between Willis and Brook Avenues . After getting the ladders in place , the men proceeded leisurely to scrape the dead bark from the shade trees that grow in this street . Barring numerous intermissions to discuss politics and other topics of seemingly great importance , this work was continued during Saturday , Monday . and Tuesday , and for aught I know to the contrary may be still going on . I am not sufficiently well versed in the nursery business to venture an opinion as to the necessity or desirability of the trees having a Spring pruning , but I do know , as a man reared on a farm , that two men from my section of the country could have finished up this entire block within one day and had plenty of time also for the " conversation game , " which seems to be the " long suit " of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , and that we are coolly informed by the head of the City Government that they will be higher ?
