 |p767  ONE night last June , the walls of Drury Lane Theatre resounded with such acclamations as that old playhouse has seldom heard in all its history . A solitary figure stood in front of the curtain , listening with a grave smile to the enthusiasm which seemed to have no end . It was Sir Henry Irving taking leave of the London playgoers on the last night of his season , a season made memorable at every performance by scenes very similar to this . " You are all very young , " he said , when the audience would let him speak ; and , indeed , to a veteran actor , near the end of his career , the youth of this vast assemblage must have been singularly gratifying . Every night Drury Lane had been thronged with young people . The younger generation had knocked at the doors in a sense quite different from that of Ibsen 's famous saying . They had come in thousands , not to tell the old actor that his day . was done , that his methods were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to swear fealty to him , to crown him with fresh laurels , to thunder his praises with passionate emotion . Thus spoke Drury Lane . It carried some of us back to the days when we also were young , when this actor was carving his way to fame , and when we clamored our best to help him . Prael , 1905 my memory retraced the course of time to 1873 , the year when I was first a pittite at the old Lyceum . How we jammed the pit to see Irving as Eugene Aram ! As a haunted murderer , he had made his great success in " The Bells : here was another in the same line . In the first act , he was the melancholy  |p768  wooer of the parson 's daughter in the peaceful vicarage ; in the second , the bones of his victim were exhumed , and he shrank from looking on them ; in the third , he confessed his crime to the girl in the churchyard , and enacted it over again with tremendous effect . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person ; we pittites could see that with half an eve ; the displacement of his bones was a provoking accident , but for which the vicarage romance would have run quite smoothly . Irving threw such passion into the enactment of the murder before the terrified Ruth , that we were thrilled with sympathy . We gloried in being accessories after the fact . Later came " Philip , " another haunted-criminal play , wherein a Spanish gentleman of fiery temper shot his brother after much provocation . Over the dead man 's face the remorseful Cain reverently drew his cloak , and then stole guiltily away , followed by our vehement plaudits . He who knows not what it is to revel in deeds of blood on the stage , when they are done with distinction , and when the doer carries about with him an abiding sorrow that makes him a romantic figure , has a poor experience of life 's pleasures . Philip had not slain his brother after all . That graceless person turned up again , and made love to Philip 's wife . Suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered the doorway of the room where his brother was in hiding to be walled up , when lo ! a repentant apparition , eager to affirm that a brother 's blood had not been shed , or , at any rate , that enough remained to justify a fraternal embrace . It was not a very good play ; its note was not particularly fresh ; still , the imagination of the actor , his sovereign quality , presented the idea of the haunted man with undiminished glamour . But what of his future ? Some critics predicted it freely enough , to the indignation of us youngsters in the pit , who glowered at all the bald heads in the stalls , suspecting that every man with no hair to speak of wrote like a cynic in the papers . He was a very good comedian , said those critics of Henry Irving ; witness his Digby Grant in " Two Roses " ; that eccentric old gentleman who supposed that delicacy of feeling could be rewarded with " a little cheque . " He was a good melodramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles I was not melodrama , to be sure ; the critics did not know exactly what it was ; they admitted , however , that it was a picturesque character , full of dig/ nity and tenderness . But we were not to imagine , for one moment , that the actor who had done these things could succeed in the dear old " legitimate . " That was reserved for tragedians who belonged to a " school " ; whose style had broadened slowly down from precedent to precedent ; whose elocution rolled on like Byron 's ocean ; who had no angularities of deportment , like the ambitious gentleman at the Lyceum ; who gave you Nature in her majestic mood , with an imperious roar and an earthshaking stamp . These old tragedians loomed chiefly in our fancy and in the annals of the stage , for their school was no longer on the scene . But Phelps was still alive ; the august shade of Macready was not too remote for a critic with a bald head ; and , when the audacious Irving appeared as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did squeak and gibber in the London streets . What a " first night " that was in 1873 ! I can still see the bald heads growing crimson . They remembered Richelieu , a very different personage from this presumptuous innovator . We had never seen Richelieu before , but had a triumphant assurance that here was the very man . Excellent figure of the " legitimate , " this Cardinal of Bulwer 's ! Was ever such wiliness , broad , underscored , capital-lettered , so plain that owls might see it by day ? But , to be sure , Irving 's wiliness was not broad enough for the critics who had memories . Hitherto he had been his own standard ; he was now at grips with the Past . Is it ever easy for the old playgoer to hail the merit of the new actor , playing the familiar parts with unfamiliar method , with new and disturbing insight ? We associate the characters of the drama , the characters that really live , with some personality of the stage who has made a lasting impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving came to play Hamlet , it was a far more serious affair than Bulwer . Cradled in melodrama , b ambition aspired to the lawful line of succession in Shakespearian acting , as though he had been born in the purple . It was set se much that he offended the memory of some particular Hamad . But Hamlet was a classic , shrined in tradition , guarded by the embattled phalanx of the old school . Here was an actor who put life into the revered abstraction , made the heart of its mystery glow with a romantic flame , interpreted the play of intellect and the depth of passion with equal mastery ; and was , in fine ,  |p770  the veritable Hamlet , in his dignity , his melancholy , his humor , his blasting irony , in all that was lovable in his nature . I have seen lots of Hamlets since . I have sat in a theatre where the partisans of the Hamlet then upon the scene , and the partisans of some other Hamlet fortunately absent , have almost come to blows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the factions of the inky cloak . Anybody may be Othello or Macbeth without breaking up our happy homes ; but do you dare , sir , to maintain that the Hamlet you admire is to be mentioned in the same hemisphere with the glorious being who trod the battlements at Elsinore when I was a boy ? Then have at you , sir ! This is why I do not enumerate those other Hamlets . But to my thinking , I have seen only one inspired Hamlet , only one actor who was born Hamlet ; the rest have worn the inky cloak and the dejected ' havior of the visage ; but none of them could say with conviction : " I know not seems . " This may stir up anathema in some quarters ; and I should be rather glad if it did , for the present generation is in peril of a declining taste for theatrical controversy . Whenever Irving essayed Shakespeare anew , the battle raged as fiercely as ever . Macbeth , now ? ah ! the first night of his Macbeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little piece before the tragedy ; the queer old custom of prefacing Shakespeare with a farce , as if to fortify our spirits , was not yet dead . None of us had ever seen Macbeth ; and we beheld him now as a murderer , a conscience-stricken ghost-seer , who plucks up his soldierly nerve only in the last act ; in a word , the haunted criminal of the early Irving play . His martial deeds were talked about ; but , until he resolved to die with harness on his back , you would never have thought he had the spirit of a warrior . The enemy blasphemed like anything ; they said that Shakespeare never drew such a craven ; Macbeth was a lion-hearted man , who could not have made this pitiful spectacle after Duncan 's murder , his knees knocking together with abject fright . Macbeth was an heroic part ; was this the heroic way of playing it ? We had our misgivings ; it sounded so natural that heroes should be represented heroically . But was that Shakespeare 's view ? Heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " bleeding sergeant " says of Macbeth 's prowess on the battle-field against the deadly insults to his manhood from the lips of his wife ! Irving 's con/ ception was right ; and Macbeth , a bloody-minded villain with a turn for poetry and philosophy , and a paralyzing dread of ghosts ? ? Take any shape but that ! "  - -  must be deposed from his heroic state . Of course , you must not insist too strongly on the meaning of Shakespeare , even when you know what he does mean . Salvini 's Othello , who dragged Desdemona about by the hair in the mad frenzy of a jealous animal , was scarcely the Othello of Shakespeare , calm and sacrificial . But he was a prodigy of superb force . Fanny Kemble , when she saw Irving play Shylock , is reported to have said : " If Shakespeare could see this , he would rewrite the part . " If the Shylock of the early stage tradition was the Shylock that Shakespeare did see , the comic Jew in a red wig and a false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acting of his characters . The dramatist who created Portia and Rosalind , and saw them played by boys , must have been content with strange illusions . The low comedian , as Shylock with red hair , tickled the groundlings , who had not the faintest suspicion that Shakespeare had made out the strongest vindication of the Jews against their persecutors . Did nobody in his day listen to Shylock 's fierce irony with an inkling of the truth ? " If you prick us , do we not bleed ? If you wrong us , shall we not revenge ? " The Jewish answer to Christian villainy was to " better the instruction " ; hence the famous bond , a pound of Antonio 's fair flesh . Perhaps the absurdity of a contract , wherein a subtle and crafty Jew was made to overreach himself so grossly , was the poet 's concession to contemporary prejudice . Perhaps it never struck him that no man , least of all Shylock , could imagine that the law of Venice or any other state would allow him to exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is come to the point , it is not her silly juggle about the shedding at one drop of blood that determines the cause ; it is the obvious argument that no Jew , under any bond whatever , can be allowed to contrive against the life of a citizen . If cutting a pound of flesh off a gentleman 's person is not contriving against his life , what is it ? Imagine a Duke of Venice to whom this had to be pointed out ! Shakespeare did not care ; he took the story as he found it ; and he had his recompense , perhaps , in the delight with which the populace greeted the discomfiture of the droll comedian with the preposterous nose and the inflamed wig . The  |p772  trial scene must have been very humorous in those far-off days , when the serio-comic brutality of the Jew was outwitted by a lively boy making believe to be a young woman masquerading as a Junior Counsel of the Padua Bar , and instructing an incredibly ignorant Venetian Magistrate in the elements of law and common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were mitigated as time went on , when the Jew became less grotesque , and Portia was really a woman , though rather a pompous lady , as pompous as Fanny Kemble herself . With Henry Irving as Shylock , and Ellen Terry as Portia , the course of evolution was complete . It was not in the malignity of his premature triumph that Shylock was great ; it was in the splendor of his ruin , in the pathos of the broken old man tottering from the court . The Victorian playgoer sat in awe at the very moment of the story when the Elizabethan playgoer had burst into rude rejoicing . " The Merchant of Venice " has been the chief monument of twenty brilliant years of Irving 's management at the Lyceum . The dear old " legitimate " had a splendid home ; and the friends of its palmy days , who had wept for its decline , began to cheer up a little , although they shook their heads at the scenery . People , it was said , went to the Lyceum to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven knows what takes some persons to the theatre ; it is certainly not the play . You can not tell why others buy books ; it is not to read them . But vast numbers who had held aloof from theatres in earlier times flocked to the Lyceum , because they found so much there to gratify an intelligent taste . What Henry Lying did most notably was to bring serious people back to the acted drama . The mind that shaped every detail of a production , and brought the beauty of scenic effect into harmony with the comedy that was enacted at Venice or Messina , knew the secret of the grand style . Stage-carpenters had erected imposing structures elsewhere without captivating the public ; but these were structures with no artistic suggestion to give them atmosphere . It was distinction that reigned on the Lyceum stage , not expenditure . You had the life and color of Bassanio 's world , with Shylock 's grim dwelling in the Ghetto over the bridge , so strongly in the memory that , in Venice , the whole scene came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sculptured faces of a humorously Semitic cast , under which you pass from the Grand Canal , had surely echoed the footsteps of Shylock when he  |p773  returned to his house to find that Jessica had fled with her Christian lover . Who has walked in Venice without the Lyceum pictures rising in his mind ? I recall those pictures , not on account of any scenic magnificence , but because they live in the imagination together with the noble figures that moved in them ; just as I recall the cuckoo-clock in the simple interior of Dr. Primrose 's parsonage , because it reminds me of the old Vicar , one of Irving 's most admirable impersonations , making the inventory of his household gods when misfortune had overtaken him . It is said that , as a manager , Sir Henry did much for the stage , but very little for the modern dramatic author . This is true ; but , in a policy of poetic drama largely Shakspearian , the modern author could not have a conspicuous place . It would have been deeply interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own day by Pinero ; to see Irving exchange his doublet and hose , or the ecclesiastical robes of a bygone age , for the garments which are worn by dramatic personages who have chambers in the Albany . As a matter of fact , I do not think he appeared in any modern costume on the Lyceum stage more than once in twenty-five years . In a dramatic sense the clothes would have been too small ; he was too big a personality for the English comedy of our day ; he would have looked like the spacious times of Elizabeth cribb 'd in a Mayfair drawing-room . Poetic dramas of all eras used to pour in at the Lyceum ; a rage for historical characters possessed many persons in all ranks of life ; it was quite a common thing for a man engaged in some humble but exacting avocation to toss off a five-act play in blank verse on the subject of Savonarola , and to intimate that on the Lyceum stage the success of this modest effort was certain . Unknown authors were resolved not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushels in , and there was no illumination . One illustrious hand wrote dramatic verse to some purpose . Tennyson 's " Queen Mary " and " The Cup " were played at the Lyceum ; and had Tennyson lived to see the production of " Becket , " he would have been a gratified man . Mr. George Meredith tells an amusing story of a walk he took with Tennyson one day , when the bard was very silent and gloomy . They walked several miles , and suddenly Tennyson growled , " Apollodorus says I am not a great poet . " This critic was a Scottish divine , and neither his name nor his opinion was of much  |p774  consequence . Mr. Meredith said something to that effect ; and Tennyson retorted , " But he ought not to say I am not a great poet . " That was the entire conversation . Had Apollodorus said that Tennyson was not a great dramatist , he would not have outraged the heavens . When he thought of the stage in the last months of his life , Tennyson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The Promise of May . " " But Irving will do me justice with Becket , ' " said , the poet . Justice was done indeed , and something more . After twelve years Sir Henry has been playing " Becket " again , and the spell of his personality has never been so commanding . The actor who gave us thrills thirty years ago as the haunted criminal , can do what he wills with us as the mediaeval fanatic and martyr . By the cold reading of history I judge Becket to have been an obstinate bigot , resolute to protect a dissolute clergy against the laws of the realm , prating of " God 's honor " when he meant his own authority , and drunk with the power which the Middle Ages gave to the priest who wielded the ban of the Church . You can read Tennyson 's drama , and still have that idea of Becket very strongly in your mind . But not when you see Irving in the part ; then the grasping prelate is transfigured ; he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his martyrdom has a beauty of sacrifice which sums up all that the saints endured ; and the accusing voice of history is stilled . The imagination of the actor has never had a greater triumph ; he seems born to impersonate ecclesiastics , great Princes of the Church in all ages , and country parsons like the Vicar of Wakefield . Then you remember his sinister monarchs , his Richard and Louis , the flamboyant quality of some characters , the delicate detail of others ; such a portrait in miniature as Corporal Brewster , finished to the point where it is just divided by a nicely calculated shade from painful realism . One remembers these figures with some appreciation of their diversity , looking back upon the range of art this remarkable personality has compassed . For the actor 's calling , Sir Henry Irving has done more than any of his great predecessors . None of them ever watched over its interests with his jealous care . He has combated prejudice with so fine a temper , and pursued his art with so true a service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to rank him high among its worthies ; and people to whom the theatre  |p775  makes no appeal hold his name in honor . The personal magnetism of any remarkable man is best attested by its influence upon his eminent contemporaries . In Henry Irving 's case , it is illustrated through some of the foremost men of his age . The Emperor William , when he met the actor , betrayed a certain preparation for the occasion ; before a word could be said by way of introduction , he launched into an eloquent exposition of Shakespeare , which , I am told , threw a dazzling light on several obscure problems . Mr. Gladstone was attracted in a different way . At one period , when he was not burdened by the cares of office , he was fond of watching the performances at the Lyceum from a chair in the " wings . " One night , when the stage was set for the opera ball in the " Corsican Brothers , " his curiosity led him into one of the boxes for spectators in the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once descried by the pit and greeted with shouts of joy , which caused him hastily to withdraw . This was his first and only appearance in the drama , outside of the dear old " legitimate " at Westminster . The magnetic influence of Irving induced him to give a singular performance even there . He took the actor to the House very late one evening , put him under the Gallery , and sat with a grim , impassive air on the Treasury Bench . Suddenly , without apparent reason , he leaped to his feet , and delivered an impassioned speech , set off with all the expressive and dramatic gesture for which he was so famous . The House seemed surprised ; Members looked at one another , and murmured : " What is the old man up to now ? " They thought it was some deep , political game . But , a week or two later , a friend of Irving 's , encountering Mr. Gladstone , mentioned the actor 's visit to the House , and Gladstone eagerly inquired : " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! " Never in the least suggesting the traditional player 's manner off the stage , Irving has always impressed most people , I think , by an indefinable air of authority . A stranger , meeting him for the first time , might take him for an experienced diplomatist , with that sardonic humor which springs from a diplomatic knowledge of human nature . Presently , the observant stranger would detect in him the humorist , with the true humorist 's kindly eye for the affections as well as the failings of his species . There has never been in Henry Irving any pose of any sort , but always a fine simplicity ; a quietly impressive suggestion that the  |p776  head of the dramatic profession took that profession seriously , and exacted on its behalf the respect that was due to his own personal character . This may partly explain why he fascinates liberal-minded Bishops , and has a strong following among the junior clergy . Even Non-conformist divines have sat at the Lyceum without attempting to disguise their edification ; and one of them ? a famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic moments by the secular pulpit in Wellington Street . Long before Irving received his knighthood , the late Queen desired to confer that distinction upon him . This was as far back as 1883 . He was about to pay his first visit to America ; and the Lord Chief Justice , Lord Coleridge , who presided at a dinner that was given to him by a distinguished company , suggested this as an admirable occasion for announcing the signal mark of the Queen 's favor . But , with his characteristically subtle sense of fitness , Irving felt that his first appeal to the American public should be made entirely on his artistic merits , without the shadow of a suggestion that he sought to influence the judgment by such a decoration . It was a delicate position ; the favors of the Sovereign can not be lightly put aside ; but the choice was characteristic of the man . Since then , the American people have given him many proofs of their warm regard ; and few ambassadors have done more than he to make good-will between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set an unfamiliar foot on the shores which have become so friendly . There have been many changes ; the ranks of the old players are sadly thinned . The melancholy grace of Edwin Booth is a beloved memory ; Jefferson will delight us no more . Who that saw them can forget the brilliant nights at the Lyceum long ago , when Booth and Irving played together in " Othello , " and that tragedy was represented with a general excellence such as no man had ever known ? Henry Irving may be called the last of the Old Guard , crossing the ocean once more to bid farewell to the great people who have made him one of themselves for a generation . And when the moment comes for another leave-taking , and we on this side must say our own farewells to him at the close of his public life , they will mingle with echoes of friendship and regret from a throng of American hearts .
