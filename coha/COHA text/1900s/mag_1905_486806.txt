Distinct notice was served upon the President , by the vote of the House on Thursday on the Panama Canal appro priation , that no more lump sums will be granted him to spend at discretion . Enough Republicans joined with the Democrats to cut some $5,000,000 off the estimates which the Administration submitted as a minimum . Moreover , an amendment was adopted demanding hereafter itemized estimates , especially for salaries The latter have been , so think many Congressmen from the backwoods , not accustomed to our new and large Imperialistic ways , unduly lavish , and have fallen more freely upon the just ( that is , the President 's personal friends ) than upon the unjust ( whom we will not give pain by specifying ) Secretary Taft is hurt that there should be even an intimation that graft may have crept into expenditures under his direction So was Secretary Wilson , so was Postmaster-General Payne , until the facts in their departments were brought out . Nobody accused them of personal dishonesty , as no one would dream of accusing Mr. Taft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse , even if abuses have not crept in That is for Congress to determine in the investigation which even the Secretary now admits to be inevitable Meanwhile , the House has called a halt It has knocked one-third off the President 's Panama emergency estimates , although he had carefully explained in his message that to do so would be a " great folly , " if not actually a " crime " , and it has constrained the Senate to follow suit So far as regards its figures , which cover the fiscal year ending June 30 , the ' Secretary of the Treasury 's report to Congress tells little that is new . The year 's Treasury deficit of $23,004,228 was known five months ago , it has also been plain enough that the estimate in last year 's report of a $22,300,000 surplus for the present fiscal year could not be fulfilled The Secretary himself now alters that cheerful forecast to prediction of an $8,000,000 deficit He makes this change , notwithstanding the fact that his forecast of revenue for the fiscal year 1906 is increased $13,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same period . The report is entirely frank on this phase of the situation Secretary Shaw points out that the yield of customs and internal revenue is always uncertain , even with unchanged tax laws ; that " conditions which can not be anticipated are always reflected in revenues , " and that " a very small cloud in the financial sky will cause marked fluctuation in customs receipts " This is perfectly true , and it is an excellent argument against the resting of the Treasury 's fortunes on a protective tariff , whose revenue-producing power is always highest when revenue from that quarter is least needed , and always collapses utterly when income from other sources is declining . The Secretary 's only conclus.on is that the Treasury ought not to encroach on the present very large money surplus in its vaults and in depository banks This advice would be more useful if Mr Shaw would tell us what he would have the Treasury do when confronted with chronic deficits The most striking feature of the report of the Secretary of War is the omission of any mention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter drop , or they feel , in view of the reports of the Inspector-General and Military Secretary , that the case for the sale of beer is not quite so clear as was thought Another motive may be the natural desire to give the new post recreation buildings h longer trial Secretary Taft does not yield any space to the advocacy of the President 's plan of promotion by selection , but very wisely urges greater severity in the elimination of unfit officers as one way of aiding promotion He is quite correct in saying that this is both " possible and practicable " He would dismiss all unfit or deficient lieutenants , and retire captains and field officers who fail in their professional work The needed legislation to bring before a board any officer deficient in his studies he should have without loss of time . At the time of the reorganization of 1870 , there were so-called " benzine boards " which did a lot of housecleaning . But the army needs a purging as much to-day as it did then , unless it is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of the reorganization of 1901 If Mr. Taft should devote himself to this subject . obtain the laws he needs , eliminate politics , and bold officers strictly responsible for their military progress , he will do the army an even greater service than Mr. Root Without other comment than italics , Secretary Hitchcock refers , in his annual report , to the punishment visited upon Bartlett Richards and William G. Comstock of Nebraska for illegally fencing and using some 250,000 acres of Government land . " They pleaded guilty , and , after consideration of the matter , the court imposed a pie in each case of $300 , and sentenced the defendants to the custody of the marshal for six hours . " This terrible penalty was inflicted against the advice of a District Attorney who seems to have much the same tender feeling for land grafters as the child who always " kicked the stranded jellyfish back into the sea " had for dumb creatures Richards has been cne of the boldest and most successful of the tribe that has grown rich on the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of securing homestead claim assignments , but even this method of increasing his holdings has been too slow , the Government 's surveyors found in one enclosure 77,000 acres of public land held without the shadow of a claim . " What are you going to do about it9 " he asked when Secretary Hitchcock 's agents first exposed the fraud " Prosecute , " ordered Mr Hitchcock . Indictments against Richards and others were found , but when the District Attorney showed an inclination to push the cases , he was replaced Then a special prosecutor was sent out who was not under the domination of Richards . After Secretary Hitchcock 's agent arrived , there followed an offer to confess the facts , and a promise to remove the fences . The District Attorney thereupon recommended the dismissal of the charges , but the special prosecutor refused The only alternative left  --  a plea of guilty and appeal to the mercy of the court ? ' was adopted by Richards The District Attorney assured the judge that the man was acting in good faith , that the illegal fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special consideration The farcical sentence followed , though the law provided " a fine of not exceeding $1,000 and imprisonment for not exceeding one year for each offence , " and Richards went back to the management of his " land and feeding company " So far , therefore , the Government has not been able to " do " anything practically , but in Nebraska it is beginning to be felt that Mr. Hitchcock means business A number of other public-land pirates have actually broken up their pastures , and the crusade is extending to Kansas , where , a few days ago at Topeka , seven indictments were returned by the grand jury against the unlawful holders of 50,000 acres of Government pasture land The verdict of the court-martial in the case of Midshipman Meriwether is most disappointing If he is to be excused because of the existence of prizefighting in the past , he should have gone scot free . As it is , his serious offence is not condoned , but is penalized merely by a reprimand and confinement to the Academy for one year  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manslaughter would be punished by a prison sentence in this State Here is a case where the ends of justice would have been much better subserved by turning the offender over to a civilian court We can not but assume that the corps of midshipmen will look upon the outcome of Meriwether 's trial as but a slight rebuke , and as indicating that the high officers of the navy are little opposed to the practice of prizefighting Fortunately , the Secretary of the Navy has taken an admirable stand on this question , and , now that the Meriwether matter is settled , the public may look to him to end a disgraceful and barbaric custom , reflecting seriously on the standards and discipline of the Naval Academy . However much or little reliance is to be placed upon the early reports of favorable prospects for the two-State bill in Congress , it is certain that the public attitude toward that measure has changed considerably As regards the amalgamation of Oklahoma and Indian Territory , there is no longer any practical difference of opinion Even a virtual referendum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the combined State would go through Congress in a day if presented by itself . As for Arizona and New Mexico , their reunion to form a sinble State will doubtless be opposed by the same interests and for the same reasons as heretofore It can no longer be said , however , as it has been so often , that Arizona is " a unit " for independent Statehood That side seemed to have everything its own way Now the other is making itself heard A number of newspapers are supporting joint Statehood , and mass meetings at several places have endorsed it Moreover , some extremely good arguments are furnished by recent revelations about the men slated for Congress if two States are made on the Southwest border If the State of New Mexico is to come into being primarily to make " Bull " Andrews a Senator , Congressmen otherwise friendly may well hesitate The various suits for rebating , to be instituted in the Federal Court at Philadelphia , ought to test thoroughly the efficacy of the present law . Attorney-General Moody is reported to entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the arguments for and against Federal rate regulation , rebating is an evil concerning which there can be no dispute . When a common carrier secretly builds up one shipper and destroys another , it is guilty of injustice for which the most skilled casuist of the Standard Oil Company can offer no defence If the law does not provide a remedy , the law should be amended To that every honest man will agree But the only way to find the defects of the law is to test it , to carry the suits through to the bitter end In open debate on Monday Senator Tillman said hotly , " I do n't believe we shall ever get anywhere with this matter as long as the President of the United States , who has taken the lead in it , is willing to whitewash members of the Cabinet , as he did Paul Morton .

With such companies as the Pennsylvania , the Reading , the Lackawanna , and the New York Central suspending the privileges to politicians and newspaper men , the smaller roads can afford to pluck up courage and refuse to be bled In this juncture , when there is so much searching of heart , no one conies forward to defend the system of pass-giving , for it is really indefensible . People must be vastly edified by the virtuous attitude of the newspapers , which are now ready to let judgment begin with the House of God The pass for the employee of the railway is no concern of the public , but the pass for the favored shipper , the newspaper-writ er , and the politician is A railwal is not a benevolent institution It does not bestow favors without expecting something in return When it sends flee tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rebate on his freight-bills , thus evades the spirit of the law , and handicaps every one of his competitors The editor receives passes , not because railway presidents esteem editors above the rest of mankind , admire their literary skill , their accomplishments in conversation , and their rugged independence of character No , the explanation is less flattering The railway president frankly wants kind treatment in the news and editorial columns . He gets it . And as for the politician  --  the railway pass distributor wants to lay him under " a moral . obligation , " as C. E Hughes put it in examining Senator Platt In fine , the pass is a petty bribe which purchases " influence " or a vote the right way . The sooner the corrupt practice is abolished , the better for all concerned . It was over the " right " of a Representative to select postmasters within his dist let , it will be remembered , that the Hon ' Gussie " Uai tiller of the Sixth Massachusetts Distru t entered upon his 1 anions con t r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , who made shoi t work of ( ' ongi essional m e-tensions in that case , is now preparing , according to report , to extend a virtual merit system to all the Pi esidentml postmasters " Where the ( elm of such an official has expired , he will be continued in the service it his record is eported to be ' good ' or ' excellent ' "  - -  this is the outline of the plan The " clean-sweep " idea recedes constantly further into the bat kgi ound Definite terms , established either by law or by custom , have succeeded femue solely dependent on politics A change of the party in power does not displace a faithful postmaster until he has i ounded out his four years Of course , it is a mulch easier matte ' to say that lie shall not be displaced even then , when , as at pi esent , most of these officials all eadv belong to the dominant party The sti am will come when a Democratic Pi esident is faced by the array of Republic an postmasters Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the classified service is the next question South Cam dispensary system is once more in trouble with the Federal authorities The United States Supreme Court has decided that when the State becomes a liquor-dealer , even for a high moral purpose , it must pay internal-i evenue taxes like anybody else The court reasons that if a State could , by taking over any line of business , relieve that business of its contribution to the Fedex al le enue , the several States could , by extending then ' own functions far enough , " practically destroy the efficiency of the National Government " The sum involved  --  which was originally paid and sued for by South Carolina  --  is $20,000 , not a large tax for a business with annual profits of $400,000 Still , the decision will doubtless cause the same resentment as the ongmal-package decisions rendered w hen Tillman had first started the dispensai y These two Federal decisions have first made the State liquor monopoly impossible by legalizing private importations in the original package , and now taxed the State into the bin gain Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States a few days more than eleven months ago , and it is now for the first time definitely known that he is preparing to accept the new post The versatile Governor , throughout his career , has almost uniformly escaped from doing the particular thing people expected of him In this case , instead of going to Washington at the beginning of the session like an ordinary Senator-elect , and letting himself be sworn in , he will tarry a while longer to put his own house in order . Not only do the primary and railroad-commission laws passed last winter need some tinkering , but important litigation over railroad taxes is still in the courts . Hence the special session and the Governor 's decision to see it through This is the long session of Congress , and if the lawmakers at Madison are expeditious , he may still get to Washington in time to have a hand in the rate-bill debates When philanthropy is at the mercy of " eminent counsel , " we get such unhappy spectacles as Mr Ryan presented at the insurance inquiry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatching control of the Equitable from envious and angry financial iivals , he was eagei to inform Mr Hughes about the manoeuvres and threats of his quondam competitor , Mr Harriman , but was cruelly stopped by " advice of counsel " This was obviously a great surprise and disappointment to Mr. Ryan , and nothing but his respect for Mr Cravath as an authority on the whole duty of a financier skating on thin ice induced him to obey that gentleman and commit a misdemeanor For the statute is clear If Mr Hughes 's questions were " material " and " proper , " Mr. Ryan made himself liable to fine or imprisonment , or both And there was no reasonable doubt that the questions were material and proper They went straight to the heart of the matter the committee is investigating  --  that is , the corrupt alliance of insurance companies with great speculators and powerful politicians If Mr. Harriman tried to frighten Mr Ryan by threatening to turn Boss Odell loose on him , it was of the highest public importance that the fact should be known A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tuesday , and we now know that Mr Hal riman , on being refused a half-share in the Equitable , threatened to use his " legislative influence " against him In Mr Edward Atkinson we lose a man who had to be called an old-fashioned American , though his type was once common He had by study and reflection formed convictions about economics and government which he did not feel at liberty to alter while you waited His reasoning powers and his conscience he thought of as something else than a mere register of passing Popular feeling What made lion seem so singular in his later years was that his opinions did not ebb and flow with the majority in elections He was of the school of democracy illustrated by John Stuart Mill , believing that liberty is a demonstrable good ; that the force of argument is really of moreweight than the decree of a caucus ; that public policy ought to be settled by considerations of reason and justice rather than of profit In an age when it was the fashion to meet all objections by saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bill is sure to pass , " Mr. Atkinson retained the awkward habit of insisting upon examination and discussion This was what made him so often voted " a bore " ? he had such a wearisome way of bringing new-fangled notions to the test of fact and logic , and proving them absurd and dangerous ' One can not imagine Senator Lodge being ieally patient with such a man But his sturdy consistency , his holding fast to the proved good , his scorn for humbug and his love of sincerity , his stanch defence of true Americanism , with his large attainments and wide and fruitful studies , made him one to value living and to mourn when dead As a business man , too , he revolutionized the methods of insuring cotton mils , and he warmly sympathized with the South in its efforts to develop its cotton industries and attain an independent economic growth His voluminous writings have contributed little to economic thought , but are replete with practical suggestion IN hat makes Capt Roald Amundsen 's achievement in sailing a small vessel from Greenland to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his vessel and crew " We shall be eight men all told , " he wrote on announcing his plans , " and our vessel , the Goa , is 47 tons register , 70 feet long between uprights , and twenty feet broad It may seem that the vessel is small , and , indeed , it is one of the smallest which have set out for a long polar expedition , but the choice was made after full consideration " And evidently with wisdom Yet strange is it that the most successful craft to encounter the Northwest ice-pack should be this cockleshell , in which few people would care to cross the Atlantic , even in calm weather , and which at best can make only four knots an hour by means of its gasolene motor Practically , therefore , so far as his vessel was concerned , Amunsden was but little better off than Frobisher , whose two ships of 1576 measured 20 and 25 tons Even Barents , whose discoveries along the coast of Nova Zembla in and after 1594 were so important , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trust to patience , and steal through when there is an opportunity " He made no effort to penetrate to the nor th His main object was to locate the magnetic pole , the position of which was fixed for the first time in 1831 by Commander ( afterward Sir ) James Clark Ross on the westein shore of Boothia Felix , in latitude 70 ?
