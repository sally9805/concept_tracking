txt BETTING ON THE CUP RACES . It seems that British money has come forward , in sums of considerable amounts , to be wagered upon the victory of the Shamrock U. It is quite true that this money is- bet against odds , the holders of it asking and getting the rate of 5 to 3 . But that it should be offered ' in any such quantities as to show that it is bet commercially and not as a mere ebullition of patriotic enthusiasm is none the less remarkable and unprecedented . What is the ground for encouragement to the British bettors ? The ground fon discouragement is very evident . It is that in half a century the British challenger has never won nor come near winning , and that only one race , or heat , stands to the credit of a British yacht out . of the great number of races that have been sailed . That fact has deterred businesslike British bettors heretofore from betting on the British boat . The ground for encouragement they have now is the apparent showing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenger , and that the American boat built for a defender is not so good as the old defender of last time . In other words , Mr. RERHESHOFF has not improved upon himself , but Mr. WATSON has improved upon Mr. FIFE . The apparent showing that Columbia is still better than Constitution was emphasized yesterday . And we suppose that there is little doubt that the old American boat will be chosen to compete with the new British boat . . - This is the first time that tpis has happened . Ever since Puritan and Genesta raced the new defender has been the clear superior of the old . Constitution can not beat Columbia . Can Shamrock II . beat Columbia ? That is the question upon the answer to which will depend the possession of the cup . It is a question which may be very ingeniously argued on both sides , but which is to be settled on the water . Certainly it looks now , from a bettor 's point of view , like an excellent question to bet upon . Possibly the unbroken record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count for more , in the odds against the challenger , than the results of investigating the merits of the boats , as shown either by their models or their past performances .
