 |p690  HAPPENING to meet one day a gentleman whose presence once haunted the lobby at Hartford , and who has been a familiar spirit in the secret counsels of both parties , I ventured the remark , " I , should like to be present at the last day , when you are compelled to tell all you know about Connecticut politics . " He replied , " There would be some interesting personal reminiscences . " Unfortunately for the public enlightenment , the legal evidences of many things which now lie hidden in such reminiscences will probably not be forthcoming before that day to which our conversation referred . But enough is generally known to bring to the bar of public conscience the stronghanded political system by which the civic virtue of Connecticut has been held up . Enough facts are well authenticated to expose the political methods by which this commonwealth is robbed of its honor . An exposure of the so-called practical politics of Connecticut would not be so sensational as are the accounts of the political debauchery of some other States , like Delaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more value for reformatory work in other States where much the same demoralizing methods are becoming prevalent . No better characterization of the prevalent political vice is needed than was given by ex-Governor Bulkeley ( lately elected United States Senator ) at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature on May 11 , 1893 . After declaring that no corrupt practices act is needed in this country , in answer to a direct question whether it is lawful and right for a candidate for office to buy a vote which is for sale , he replied : I think it is right for a candidate to secure that man 's vote , if he is without principle and ignorant , by any means you can use . " He further justified that method when it is " in the interest of the party " one believes to be right . The question now which the people of this old New England State have to face is just the cold , hard fact which that avowal set forth . The Legislature of Connecticut , with that record laid before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , has elected to the United States Senate the master of the system he so unblushingly justified . That act of the Legislature has put the whole system of corruption squarely before the people . The success of this system in the Legislature is an attack upon the integrity of the State . For the people to let judgment against it go by default would be a surrender of democracy . Continued failure to expose it by the press would be betrayal of its public trust . Silence of the Church , now that it is confronted by it , would be sin . In the year 1893 , when the Corrupt Practices Act was up before the Judiciary Committee , the Hartford " Courant " ended an editorial in behalf of it with this snapper : It will be interesting to see who opposes it . " We have seen . Not a single prosecution , so far as I am aware , has been brought under that law against bribery and other forms of political corruption . The whole system of practical politics has appeared against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to town . No political manipulator has seemed afraid of any sudden shock from it . Of late even the best papers which our conditions permit us to have seem too much like that ancient god of whom a solitary  |p691  prophet once said , " Either he is musing , or he is gone aside , or he is in a journey , or peradventure he sleepeth , and must be awaked . " In order to understand the present pitiable case of the internal politics of Connecticut , the first cause to be noted is the political power and possibilities of the small towns . The Constitution of the State , with its system of town representation , gives to the small towns a great preponderance in the Legislature . This naturally renders the rural districts the chosen field of the political exploiters . There control of the Legislature and of the larger part of State patronage is to be gained or lost . There it pays the candidate for high office to dig his wells and to watch his flocks . Moreover , the rotatory system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about every election , offers further opportunities for the alert manufacturer of majorities in the Legislature . Formerly , the country town was represented , often for a series of years , by some man who had been tried and was known and trusted . He needed to make no pledges to secure his nomination ; he represented his townsmen , or at least his party . He did not need to make hay while the sun shines . The extent of the change which has occurred is apparent from these figures : The proportion of members reelected to new members was , in 1800 , 54 per cent . ; in 1850 , 12.2 ; in 1880 , 9.3 ; in 1889 , 5.2 ( " Political Science Quarterly , " September , 1889 , p. 426 ) ; and in 1897 it had fallen to 2.8 per cent . The significance of this change is greater than at first glance might appear . It might be said , indeed , that such rotation has the advantage of giving different men in succession a fair chance ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it affords him easier material to work , even though it be innocent . Pipe-laying is through fresher soil . Every session the rapidly rotating wheel renders a new deal possible ; in this system nominations may be made the bribes , and the old serpent may lurk under a convenient apple-tree in any town caucus . It was not , however , until the campaign between the two Barnums in 1867 that favorable conditions for the use of money as campaign arguments in the smaller towns was fully appreciated . What was known in some quarters as the Salisbury plan " was then successfully inaugurated . It became customary for the candidate to have his personal agent in each town , who would know what was needed and how it might most practically be applied , and who was held personally responsible for delivering the goods . As to the amount of the venal vote in the rural regions , different estimates are given by men well qualified to judge . Professor McCook , of Trinity College , Hartford , as the result of some painstaking inquiries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not believe it to be over five per cent . If I might take a single town well up to the average in morality as a representative town , according to the statement computed for me by a worker who for several years has kept his private tally of the amount of the purchasable material and the price of each vote , the quantity would be somewhat over ten per cent . In one hill town the amount of purchasable votes became so large that the town committees of both parties made a mutual bargain that year not to buy any votes . The compact resulted in a popular outcry , and the keeper of the country store protested " against any movement which cut down the revenues . " The chief corruption now is in the control of the caucuses and primaries . The traps are set for the feet of good citizens long before they reach the polling-places . The innocent public knows little of the large use of money and other valuable considerations for personal ends or for large commercial interests long before a legislature convenes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the conditions which ordinarily prevail . Senator Bulkeley has not seen fit to comply with the law of Connecticut which requires a candidate for the United States Senate to make a return of all contributions or disbursements , if any , for his campaign and election . In the absence of any sworn statement from the candidate , one can only take as conjectural the moder/ ate estimate of a well-informed politician that it cost him $68,000 . If I add together the sums credibly reported to me as having been sent into several towns , and strike therefrom an average for other towns , that amount would not seem at all incredible . If I take the average of the most trustworthy statements made to me , a much larger sum , at least $ 150,000 , during the late Senatorial contest was scattered abroad over the countryside . For instance , in one town of less than eight hundred voters the local political agent of one political interest was intrusted with over a thousand dollars , which was used mostly in connection with the expenses of the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the nomination of candidates for the State Senate was offered fifty dollars as a retainer for his vote ; he afterwards found it best to return it ; or , as his own story goes , after a visit from certain political friends he found five new ten-dollar bills accidentally left in his overcoat pocket , which he returned ! I have this written statement of another delegate : " We were offered $500 for the delegation , and two others were offered $200 and $300 for a single vote . " Being myself desirous of gaining trustworthy information as to the bottom facts , not being content to rest upon what is said to be notorious , I have made inquiries of persons in a position to know in nearly all of the towns of the State . I have sought for trustworthy information from two sources ? from good citizens in all these towns who might be supposed to know something of what is happening politically in their immediate vicinity , and from politicians and workers , so far as possible , who are themselves in the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the considerable amount of information which I have been able to gain from this latter source must be kept in detail as confidential . As a general tabulation of the information so acquired , I am in a position to say that in a few towns my inquiries thus far have brought to light no credible suspicions of the corrupt use of money during the last Senatorial election ; but in by far the greater number of towns from which I have obtained returns the illegitimate use of money or other valuable considerations in connection with nominations for State offices is credibly reported , and in many instances- with circumstantial accounts of the amounts of money sent into these towns for personal political purposes , and with details of the methods in which it was used . Some political agents , who themselves handled the goods , have been carried into this demoralization so far , and they find the game so costly , that they would half like to quit it , as one of them informed me , because ashamed to look afterwards at their own faces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , legal evidence ; nevertheless it tells the truth . Some good citizens who , if they go to the caucus at all , go as innocent lambs to the slaughter , might possibly rub their amiable eyes in astonishment if some exact story ? names , places , dates , considerations , and all ? should be told them concerning what has happened right around them in personal or corporation politics in recent years . While confidential information does not permit me to give narratives which . if published , would be their own evidence , I may use such communications as materials for a typical description of the process ? taking from many individual instances a composite photograph which may represent them all . In the small town of A ( I will put it ) last autumn the United States Senatorial contest promised to be a close one . The field for the conflict was the primary . Those who were posted knew what was to happen . The public had little knowledge and less concern about what might be done . The National election , held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the mess of State politics was to be stewed . Before the primary was held a large fund was sent through a recognized political agency in the interest of one candidate into this town . It was stated that more could be had if needed . Some of this money was put out Tor personal influence , $100 for the temporary loan of one man 's political talents . Some of this fund went for more or less legitimate work and expenses . The highest  |p693  price known to have been paid to any one merely for staying away from the caucus was $37 ; another man , possessed of less inimical power , received only $25 . One man , who was himself an adept , received $50 from each side , and , as the business agent of one faction said , " the sardine never turned over . " The price for votes in this caucus went as high as $ " 10 or $15 . The manager did not retain so much for his own efforts as he had intended to keep , because in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that he had been beaten , and he felt obliged to use more liberally the last effective argument with a number of men who had been waiting around the primaries for the proper psychological moment in which to make their votes count . The representative in this town could not himself be bribed , but it was previously understood what interest he would support , and who was to provide for the election expenses . It costs the managers less if by any means they can get hold of and use a conscientious man than it does to watch and to keep from becoming restless a man more pecuniarily susceptible , like that representative from another town concerning whom the local agent wrote that he was becoming uneasy and something must be done for him . The features of this composite photograph vary somewhat in different places ; the quotations for nomination and election would need to be altered in several towns ? $300 to begin with in some small places , and more if needed ; $750 in another town , $800 for a needed man in another ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates before me to $2,500 , in other country towns . But , with varying details in its essential viciousness , the story is everywhere the same . Alike with regard to the highest honors and the smaller offices , the people do not give the gifts ; the party does not make the choice ; even the bosses themselves and the local agents often find their preferences unavailable ; " practical politics " does it , and that , being interpreted , signifies the deals and the power , the business interests and the money , of the few magnates who do care for all these things . We still fondly boast of government by the people ; we accept as necessary government by one or the other of two parties ; we laugh at and occasionally overturn government of the local boss . Is the last state of democracy to be voluntary bondage to an oligarchy ? And that oligarchy not distinguished by the virtues which fit men for government ! The methods of political control which I have just described have been rendered easier because of late there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest the field . The party caucus would not be the plague-spot which it is becoming , if a nomination did not , in most of our towns , secure an election . But usually , if the few can fix " the primary to their advantage , the respectable citizens can be trusted to do gratuitously the rest of the fixing at the polls . Another powerful factor to be considered in relation to Connecticut State politics is the city machine and its exigencies . A description of the New Haven machine , with which I am somewhat familiar , will best show how such machines have to play a considerable part in the larger field of State politics . The present boss of the New Haven combination might more happily be called the head coach in the game . IIe controls the players , sending one in , taking another out of the game as he sees fit ; but he is in it himself for the fun of it . He is one of the princes of the house of Israel , who , apart from his political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal integrity has risen to a prominent business position , and won for himself a good name among those who know him . The same industry and talents which have rendered him prosperous in business have contributed to his success as a political manager . Irrespective , however , of the personal character of its driver , the machine has its own necessities . It can not escape , even if it would , from the compulsion of its own service . In this respect the story of the needs of the present New Haven machine illustrates the exigencies of all similar organizations . It came into power from the successful conduct of ward politics ; it dictated the nomina/ tion and secured the election of the Mayor and other city officials ; but it could not stop there . Its own momentum compelled it to drive farther and harder . It laid its hands upon the county offices ; it guessed correctly what faction would be dominant in the Legislature , and made a deal which would enable it to gain control of the local judicial appointments and the accompanying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now machine made . To look after all these contracts the city organization had its hand in the nomination of the Governor of the commonwealth , and besides that became a party in interest in the choice of a United States Senator . And , still further , since besides the debts of the past to be paid the business of the future has to be secured , the city machine now has its man for the next Governor in readiness , and the successful candidate for Governor will not be likely to forget the political pit from which he has been dug . Thus it happens that the exercise and the love of political power by a single man , not himself an aspirant for any office , compels him , in order to make good what he has got , to reach dominatingly up to the judiciary , the Governorship , and the United States Senate . These influences together could not work so extensive mischief were it not for another contributory cause ; that is , the demoralization sometimes of good men through their ambition for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office itself may be the bribe ; the fear of political suicide the cause of dishonor . A young man seeks to enter political life . The door is swung open for him by the boss who holds the skeleton key to all the doors . As he passes through no pledge may be required of him , but he finds that the door through which he entered opens into a path which is hedged in on either side . He follows on , justifying his course to his friends by saying , " It is politics , you know . " He can not vote now quite according to his own conscience , for he must " save his influence for future usefulness . " As a representative in the Legislature put it the other day , making apology for other political camp-followers besides himself who had taken nominations and who did as they were told , " I suppose we must put our hands on our noses and do it . " Now and then a strong man may quit , and afterwards the people will take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and comradeship work together in keeping the manager 's majority solid ; and so it happens that the people look for leaders , and find politicians . No account of the political situation in Connecticut would be complete without some reference to the evolution of the lobby . It has passed , broadly speaking , through three stages of development . At first it was an individualistic affair . Individual lobbyists were retained for different measures . Then the lobby began to organize itself into predatory groups . Something like this was the condition about the year 1883 , when , in one instance , some eminent lobbyists who had been omitted in a piece of proposed corporate spoliation made their collective presence manifest and were taken in with the rest 1 Following this period of groups of legislative bandits , so to speak , the third house became a more organized and powerful body . Once when the Consolidated Railroad virtuously sought to dispense with its services , it soon found itself compelled , in the language of one of its officials at that time , " to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our politics , it is enough to remark that combinations between the two , corporations and State politics , have not usually been followed by a rise of the securities in which civic virtue is invested . The remark should be added that , as the latter end of the lobby , it now stands with one foot inside the Legislature , and with one hand open outside it . In such ways has it come to pass that this land of steady habits is now a good field for the political millionaire . The remark which is frequently heard where men interested in politics congregate He has put his money into it , and he ought to have it , " is enough to show the morality of it . No one will deny that the system , which has grown until it overshadows the State , has borne this season its consummate fruit . And the  |p695  cities and the towns of Connecticut have now just about the kind of government that the people who are really interested in government want . In contemplating it , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that honest citizen of mediaeval Florence who exclaimed , when something disgraceful was before the Council of his city : " I verily believe that if our forefathers , the founders of this city , could have foreseen that a like question would ever be discussed here , they would have indignantly refused to have anything to do with us . " The remedy for political demoralization requires two things ? outspoken protest , and quiet , organized work . These are means of reform in addition to the general forces of education and religion which are always at work . The first call is always for a few men who will stand up and take themselves a good beating for the sake of their cause . I could give several notable instances which have come under my observation , especially in the movement for better municipal government , in which defeat of the reformers was the first step towards the victory of their ideas . The machine , after having shown its powers by putting its adversaries to confusion , took up their ideas and put them into the charters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public protest , if it have time to do its work , was illustrated by a remark which I well remember ex-Governor Bulkeley made to me in the lobby immediately after the passage by an overwhelming majority in the House of the bill against poolselling . The bill had been opposed by the friends of gambling at the racetracks because it made no exception in their interest . The remark was this : " We should have beaten you by several majority on a full poll of the house if you had not scared them out of it . " So a good moral scare may sometimes prove effectual even in practical politics . One cause of political demoralization from which Connecticut has suffered more than other States lies in the lack of strong , independent newspapers in the leading cities . Public sentiment has been blanketed and allowed to sleep for lack of an alert and powerful press . One paper is editorially in favor of all the virtues in general , but rarely against any political corruptionist of its party in particular . Another leading paper was independent once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , formerly with independent proclivities , has become too commercialized to count . All this political corruption is part and essence of the mammon-worship which the Church is called to fight in dead earnest . Aimless preaching will not do it ; there is needed a voice in the pulpit and a response in the church which shall cost sacrifice , and which may arouse the enmity of the political world ; a preaching which shall be in the succession of that bold apostle who could say , with a conscience ringing true , " So fight I , as not beating the air . " Politicians , basking in the church , will not object to the church going into politics provided that it goes , as Apostolic Christianity never did , loaded only with blank moral cartridges . In Connecticut , as in other States , the methods are to be destroyed which are destroying democracy ; the men are to be politically exterminated who are laying our heritage waste . In every city , town , and village these men may be marked , their practices uncovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here in Connecticut something like a State co-operative moral machine may be developed before we shall have got through with this business . As one result of the last humiliating Senatorial election , some organized activity in this direction may be forthcoming . There are young men who are willing to stake their political future in taking this work up . It will require many willing hands , and some new brooms . All this is part of the larger question now coming to judgment before the whole country , and touching even so high a body as the United States Senate : Shall money wrongly made , or corruptly used , become also , in view of all the people , a money power falsely crowned ?
