Bossism proved to be in high disfavor at the polls on Tuesday . In this city , McClellan  --  certainly with the support of decent men of both parties who feareed Hearst 's triumph , possibly by the aid of fraudulent votes , as Hearst contends and threatens to test in the courts  --  ebtamed a narrow plurality of less than 4,000 votes . Jerome , on the other hand , though heavily - weighted by the court 's refusal to place his name on the Republican ticket after Flammer 's withdrawal and the machine 's recantation , succeeds by 11,000 . This victory , we need not say , is of enormous value as an example of independent candidacy , and as . checking Tammany where the need is ( in the very mature of a criminal organization ) greatest . No personal struggle throughout ' the country has excited so much interest , or enlisted so much voluntary pecuniary backing in places far remote from New York , as Mr. Jerome 's As he figured on many ballots along with Hearst , a recount to the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recount is not to be decried because it might give us the most disreputable and dangerous Mayor New York has ever been saddled with . Fiat justgia . That other sink of municipal iniquity , Philadelphia , has , to Pennypacker 's grief and amazement , redeemed itself from the thieves who , in Secretary Root 's parlance , masqueraded under the Republican party name , by some 44,000 majority . The Reform party also lending its support to William H. Berry , Democratic and Prohibition candidate for State Treasurer , he was elected by 100 , - 000 majority , and it may well be that some ventilation of his predecessors in that office will ensue . Most significant of all , perhaps , is the Republican overthrow in Ohio , where Governor Herrick and Boss Cox go under  --  the latter never to emerge , as he publicly manifests . Secretary Taft , who straddled on these worthies , repudiating Cox while sustaining Herrick , has here food for reflection , as has Senator Foraker , who just escaP- , ed allying himself also with the now shattered Durham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sung in the case of Maryland , which has spewed out the Poe disfranchising amendment May we not say of Gorman , what the South Carolina chivalry humanely reported of Colonel Shaw of the 54th Missachusetts ( colored ) Regiment , that he is " buried with his nig-gers " ? The Treasury ended the month of October with expenditure running even more heavily beyond revenue than it did a year ago . Excess of expenditure for the month , as reported , was $4,857,000 ; in October , 1904 , it was $3,952,000 This comparison is mor , e significant than the simple fact of a deficit in the month when interest payments are large As a matter of fact , the October public reve nue this year was greater by $1,500,000 than that of October last year , but expenditure showed an increase of $2,400,000 , of which amount two-thirds fall to the account of army and navy outlay Since the previous fiscal year ended last June , expenses have risen $3,100,000 over the same period a year ago . But for a sudden expansion of $12,000,000 in customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased . All experience , however , has taught how unsafe is dependence on the customs revenue as a basis for constant increase in the scale of expenditure Customs receipts fall suddenly in the vicissitudes of trade  --  the $11,800,000 decrease of the fiscal year 1904 is one case in point ; the $71,000,000 shrinkage in the fiscal year .1894 is another  --  whereas a schedule of expenditures , once fixed , does not come down along with revenue . Thus , in 1904 , expenditures increased $76,000,000 in the face of falling income . President Roosevelt 's famous " muzzling order " to his Cabinet officers turns out to be the most innocuous document ' ever issued by a Chief Magistrate The letter appeared on the face of st to be a plain request to the members of the Cabinet not to talk for publication  --  the indefatigable Secretary Loeb would relieve them of that onerous duty But the members of the Cabinet speedily informed Mr. Roosevelt that they enjoyed talking for publication ; they do not want to turn ' the job over to the accomplished Mr. Loeb ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inferiors in rank discourse wisely on the affairs of the nation Having learned their ; sentiment , the President gracefully acquiesced Far be it from him to intimate to any Cabinet ' officer when he should speak and when hold his tongue Equally ' abhorrent to the President is the notion of shutting his dear friend 's , the newspaper correspondents , from avenues of information and from the pleasure of Cabinet socie ? ty . In fine , the President meant nothing more than to express a pious hope that a member would not discuss with the reporters Cabinet action on any Department except his own . The appointment of Charles A. Stillings as Public Printer promises well for the reform of the office . Mr. Sill-rings is a practical ' printer ; he has had experience in administration , and he is cordially endorsed by large printing firms in New York and Boston . Above all , he will not be hampered by political obligations . The ablest man in the world would make a failure in the - office were he to sacrifice it to the demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous ability , and too many of them have regarded the subordinate positions as so much patronage . Under the recently dismisse F. W. Palmer , conditions had become simply intolerable . Mr. Stillings will find public opinion on this subject fully aroused and ready to resent any attempt to raid him or unload political hacks upon him . He will be strongly backed by the President , who ordered a special investigation , and who is fully alive to the necessity of economical and efficient management . Thus he takes up the work under uncommonly favorable circumstances . Not for years has a Public Printer enjoyed such an opportunity . The annual report of the Military Secretary of the Army is singular in be-ing wholly divested of that optimistic official tone so characteristic of public documents . He gives the actual num-ber of desertions during the year as 6,533 , or- more than one in every ten of the 63,022 men . Of these 63,000 soldiers , 22,254 were discharged on expiration of their enlistment , and 9,460 by reason of disability or because of a court-martial sentence , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all , 38,813 men , or more than 61 per cent . ' of the entire enrolment , left the army in a year . In other words , if their places have been filled , more than 61 per cent , of the men in the army are raw recruits . Undoubt-edly , some of the men discharged re-enlisted , but not many , for the great majority of men return to civil life as soon as possible . When it is remember-ed that of those in the service one in every six is reported by the Surgeon-General to be ill with ' disease clue to im-morality , the ' condition of the army can-not be said to be a very happy or satis-factory one . Indeed , Congress would seem to be justified in instituting an in-vestigation It should take note of the able annual report of Brig. - Gen . J. M. Lee , who blames the absence of officers from their troops , the lack of a beer can-teen , and the want of care in recruiting , ipr the present evil days of the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-teen who was falsely enlisted as being twenty-tvlo , only to desert at once  --  but no one was punished . Between the lines one reads that lack of ' discipline and accountability would also figure among Gen. Lee 's reasons were his a confidential instead of a public document . Though the Government has more applicants for most of its jobs than it-knows what to do with , it has been in unusual straits this year to get suitable men to take the positions it is especially anxious to fill . The War Department optimistically expected to secure officers for the Philippine Constabulary at $1,100 salaries from the graduates of agricultural colleges and military schools , but a diligent canvass secured only four-fifths of one applicant to each vacancy . Meanwhile , the Isthmian Canal Commission is scouring the world for persons so unfortunately situated at home that they are willing to go to work - at Panama . And this is saying nothing Of the problem of enlistments for the army and navy . There must be an inequality somewhere . If only the work of a clerk at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constalffilary lieutenant in Luzon , the local politician 's son might be indifferent which one the Congressman bestowed on him ; but so long as an unskilled man is paid more for opening and shutting a door in t ' Capitol than for toiling in the tropical sun at Culebra , the authorities must expect some variations in the distribution of applicants . If the Keep Commission can really make the District of Columbia a place of terror to loafers , the latter may clamor to be sent to the out-of-the-way places . Speaker Cannon 's reported an.agonism to a bill for railway - ate regulation is plausibly explained by his declaration not that he will unqualifiedly oppose rate legislation , but that he will oppose it until the Senate has acted . Last year the House passed a bill , but the Senate killed it ; and now Mr. Cannon wants to know what the Senate is really willing to do before he lets the House waste its time . In short Mr. Cannon and his friends seem to tie sparring for position . The Senate , or those members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire , naturally prefer to let the House frame the bill . Then they can devote as many months as they please to the task of picking flaws in it , and deciding that , after all , the measure is too radical . The members of the House who are not eager for regulation  --  and probably Speaker Cannon himself will not die of chagrin if nothing is done  --  are ready to let the Senate take the plunge . This done , the House can shake its head sadly , lament because the Senate has betrayed the people into the hands of the railways ; and throw out the bill on the ground that it is feeble and ineffective . It is a pretty game . President Robbins of the Armour Car Lines may be within his leg-al rights in refusing the answer questions put by the Interstate Commerce Commission . He can afford to hire skilled lawyers who will instruct him in all the technicalities and evasions of the law , civil and criminal . But there is still a question whether a concern which operates 12,500 cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private business . The contracts between the railways and the car lines are ingenious devices for whip-sawing the shipper . If the California orange-grower complains that he pays too much for laying down his fruit an New York , the railway manager politely assures him that the road as helpless . It can not redress the wrong , because the freight charge is very reasonable , - and the excess has been extorted by the Armours . When the appeal is carried to the Armours , the reply is that the icing and other charges are not exorbitant , that the Armours have no control over the high freight rates , that the Armours are a private company ; and what are you going to do about it ? This plea of impotence and impudence can not be tolerated . The Armour Car Lines , whatever them legal standing , are actually engaged in interstate commerce . The oppression and injustice of the monepoly are things of which Congress will take loognizance . If the Commission has no jurisdiction , a committee of Congress - can lay bare the details of an iniquitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shippers the last possible cent , and to favor certain insiders . The dying declaration of the self-killed cashier of the Enterprise National Bank of Allegheny , to the effect that " Bull " Andrews , one of Quay 's old lieutenants , had " worked my ruin " adds another heavy burden to the load of infamy which the Pennsylvania machine is now carrying . Andrews was the general called back hastily from New Mexico not long ago to rally the demoralized forces of the Penrose organization . It was for his personal benefit , as a prospective Senator , that Quay was believed to have advocated so long and uncompromisingly the four-State bill in Congress Pennsylvania politics have moved far from the cheerful times of the boss 's promise to " shake the plum-tree . " Those fat years have ended in a series of the most sordid of tragedies . A Philadelphia contemporary printed the other day a calendar of Crimes , suicides , and flights from the country , which had resulted from the alliance of business and politics in the Keystone State . Cashier Clark 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting forth every effort to appear in a respectable light , and is even spending large slims- on advertising designed for its own exculpa ton , may serve at least one good purpose as a lesson , if another is needed , of what the old regime has meant . That the wreck of a bank in western Pennsylvania should frustrate the hopes of a Territory in the extreme Southwest seems illogical , but stranger things have happened in politics . New Mexico had not only had her senior Senator picked out in advance by Quay and delivered in advance , when W. H. Andrews moved to that Territory , but definitely approved the choice last fall when it elected him delegate to Congress Certainly , the accounts of the Enterprise Bank failure would be poor credentials for a member of the most dignified body in the world . But what is the course to be pursued now ? Oklahoma and Indian Territory , to whose admission as a single State there is no opposition , have been kept so long waiting on the Southern Territories that they are again agitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers which formerly stood out against amalgamation with New Mexico , have come around to the two-State plan . But amalgamation would not settle the issue raised by the Andrews scandal . New Mexico can outvote Arizona , and , if each of the present Territories were to be given one Senator , he might still be chosen . - Since our recent comment on the refusal of the North-western Mutual Life Insurance Company to pay over money to politicians in order to save the Union , our attention has been called to the similar stand by the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company of Newark , N. J. The Insurance Commissioner of Tennessee recently wrote to President Frelinghuysen of that company asking for specific information as to any gifts made by its officers during the last ten years for political purposes , or any expenditures to defeat or to advance insurance legislation . In reply , Mr. Frehnghuysen made affidavit tnat during this period no contribution had been made by or on behalf of his company to any political party or individual candidate , or to any association or organization , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift was $2,500 ? voted by the board of directors ? for the sufferers by the Galveston flood , and its total legislative legal expenditures were $651.58 , comprising five separate payments . Every cent of this small sum was paid for counsel fees to regular representatives of the ' company . This admirable record does more than testify to the fidelity of their trust of the officers of the Mutual Benefit Life . It proves ' conclusively the needlessness of the vast corruption expenditures of the - guilty New York companies . If the Mutual Benefit Life and the Northwestern can thrive without buying legislatures , every other company can . Connecticut newspapers are charging the town clerks of that State with being in a conspiracy to defeat the purposes of the corrupt-practices act , passed by the Legislature last spring at Hartford . A majority of these officials have so far failed to file with the Secretary of State the returns of expenses incurred by candidates , and they are supported by the chairman of the Republican State Central Committee , who has publicly said that he is " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns . " But it seems probable ' that public sentiment will compel its observance . John A. Wright , who was elected a probate judge at Westbrook on October 2 , was fined $25 by a police magistrate on Wednesday week for failing to make a return of election expenses within fifteen days after the poll . Wide publicity is being given this case as a warning to the other candidates in the October election . Judge Wright declared that he filed his statement with the town clerk , - who , acting apparently in accord with most of the other town clerks throughout the State , refused to forward it But the authorities very properly declined to allow Mr. Wright to escape the responsibility . These October town elections were of relatively slight importance , yet they furnish a test of the new law , and if the town clerks ignore its provisions now , they will do so after the more important elections when the influence of a Bulkeley or a Fessenden is behinkf ' them . In dismissing Hinckley Gilbert Mitchell from the professorship of Hebrew and Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trustees of the institution are exercising their liberty , The bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church have condemned Professor Mitchell as a heretic , and they are fully entitled to have their teachers of theology as narrow and ignorant as they choose . If well-trained scholars refuse to accept the old dogmas , the supply of mediocrities who will have no troublesome doubts is absolutely inexhaustible . Mr. Mitchell has long lain under suspicion . His first step from the straight path was taking a doctor 's degree at Leipzig . A man who studies Semitic languages in Germany is almost sure to become tainted with the higher criticism . This taint Mr. Mitchell has never been able to eradicate , and as a result he has accepted some of the conclusions of modern scholarship . His views are grotesquely oat of place in a ; theological school whose purpose is to maintain the tenets of the eighteenth century ; and Professor Mitchell ought to be as glad to go as the bishops are to get rid of him . The change may reinforce the orthodoxy of Methodist students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore more acceptable to their ecclesiastical superiors . But it will hardly strengthen popular confidence in the Eoston University School of Theology . People will leap to the inevitable conclusion that the professors are not expected to search for the truth ; they are to subscribe once for all to the faith as delivered , and thereafter they are resolutely to close their minds . Negotiations with the Canadian Government are now beginning with a view to the preservation of Niagara Falls by international action . Whether it will prove legal and feasible for the two general governments to supersede , as is now suggested , the local jurisdiction of the State of New York and the Province of Ontario , remains to be seen ; but it may be true that this form of control would be a better safeguard against further encroachments . The gravity of the present menace can hardly be too often emphasized . As Dr. John M. Clarke , the State Geologist , wrote last spring . " The two ' American and three Canadian companies now in operation or about to operate , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet per second . That amount will bring the water level to the bottom of the river at the American shore . " Hence the recommendation of the International Waterways Commission , a fortnight ago , was that steps be taken to " prevent any corporate rights or franchises being granted or renewed by either Federal , State , or provincial authority . . . until this Commission is able to collect the information necessary to report fully upon the conditions and uses of these waters . " The request for such a practical truce between the friends of the Falls and the business interests seeking to exploit them can not well ' be refused . Mr Balfour appeared to advantage in his reply on Monday to the appeals ( mingled with threats ) of the London unemployed . Led by a Labor member of Parliament , they marched to Downing Street , expecting , no doubt , all kinds of soothing promises from a Premier whose Government is tottering ; but Mr. Balfour met them in manly and wholesome fashion . Abounding in sympathy , and expressing the hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he held out no hope that the Government would do anything to " make work " for the unemployed . He knows , if impulsive sentimentalists do not , that when you begin to recognize this alleged droll " au travail , you never can end ; that , on those terms , the unemployed will multiply faster than places can be made for them ; and that the truest kindness , as well as the soundest statesmanship , consists in throwing back responsibility upon individual effort and private enterprise . But imagine a Hearst in Balfour 's shoes ! He would have promised ( before election ) the earth and the fulness thereof . Such excesses as are still reported from Russia were , perhaps , to be expected after the extreme tension which preceded the Czar 's surrender . The most serious troubles , as in Odessa , seem to be rather racial than political . Apart from such bloody and lamentable confficts  --  the massacred Jews , as usual , being alleged to have " begun it " ? the latest accounts imply that the people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new institutions . M. Witte 's task is a mighty one ; his work at Portsmouth was child 's play , by comparison . As he made an especial appeal for American sympathy , it cheered him , as he showed by his response , to receive the cabled greetings sent him in the name of New York University Such assurances that educated Americans are watching with intense interest the great experiment of free government in Russia , might well be given M. Witte by other academic bodies . That the Powers would send a fleet to overawe the Sultan if he persisted in his refusal to turn over the financial control of Macedonia to their agents , has long been evident . ' They have been waiting patiently for the Porte to surrender before the sailing of cruisers . Of course , surrender will come afterwards . Austria showed a few years ago how readily the ' Sultan perceives the force of argument in big guns . Yet all through ' October the Sultan " declined positively to allow the financial agents designated by the European Concert to proceed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck . In reply to energetic protests , the Porte replied that , while it did not deny the need of financial reforms in Macedonia , it could not allow the work to be turned over to foreigners . This was not an unnatural feeling . The Sultan might well argue that , if once the Powers got hold of the purse-strings , they would proceed to take over the whole Macedonian administration . But the Powers supposed that they . had Turkey 's assent to that step , and are , at any rate , determined to take it . Before a show of force , the Porte will yield . It desires to ' be on good terms with the Powers and all their representatives ; and in this connection , we may say that we are informed that the cabled reports of trouble made by ' Turkish officials for Mr. Bryce , on his recent journey in Macedonia , were devoid of truth . The opposite , rather , was the case .                @ @ @ @ @
