 |p1108  THE mail has just brought us the details of what Mr. Asquith proposed to do with the unemployed , and the occasion seems to be opportune for comparing the question of unemployment in England and America . In England the normal percentage of organized labor unemployed is between 3 and 3% per cent . If the last report of the Federated Unions is correct there is for every unemployed trade unionist two non-trade unionists unemployed . A percentge of 3 1/2 of trade union labor means , therefore , probably over 5 per cent . of labor , organized and unorganized . This may seem a very large per cent . and a very heavy burden upon the community , but it must be remembered that of this 5 per cent . a large number are members of trade unions and are practically supported out of trade union funds . The rest are largely supported by private charity . It is probable , however , that many of them are continuously driven to drink , vagrancy and crime . So long , however , as the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unemployed , the country does not deem itself bound to take any extraordinary steps in the way of relief . A few years ago the percentage rose slightly above 3 1/2 per cent. , and a departmental committee undertook to study the question of vagrancy , which always assumes alarming proportions when its ranks are swelled by a considerable number of unemployed . The departmental committee , after an investigation which extended all over the Continent of Europe , and after taking testimony the publication of which constitutes today the most exhaustive document on the subject . reported unanimously in favor of the adoption in England of the farm colony system . Unfortunately , the opposition of John Burns , the President of the Local Government Board , has , up to the present time , sufficed to prevent the recommendation of this committee being adopted . About the time the departmental committee publisht its report , the trade unions reported a rise in the percentage of its unemployed from 3 1/2 to 7 per cent . This gave rise to considerable agitation thruout the country . The Queen appealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a large sum from her private purse , and a bill was pushed thru Parliament empowering the local authorities to borrow funds to be applied to the relief of the unemployed , provided they secured the approval of the Government Board . A large sum was subscribed thru the initiative of the Queen and the Lord Mayor of London . A large  |p1109  sum was also voted by local authorities for the purpose of furnishing emergency work . Unfortunately industrial conditions failed to improve and the percentage now reported by trade unions is 9.4 per cent . This state of things has thrown England into convulsions . The unemployed have mobbed the streets of every city and manufacturing center of the country . A man called Gray has led a mob of " Hunger Marchers " to London , and the Socialist member , Grayson , having insisted in the House that all business be suspended in order to give precedence to the question of unemployment and , upon being ruled out of order and having refused to resume his seat , was expelled from the House . A similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Smith took the same attitude as Mr. Grayson , and his eviction from the Council was prevented only by the physical resistance of those that crowded round to protect him . The majority of the London County Council today is Conservative , and they meet every effort made to pass resolutions in favor of giving work to the unemployed by the standard resolution to the effect " That the Council , having considered the policy and action of various committees , is satisfied that all proper measures are being taken by the Council in view of the existing want of unemployed . " ( Daily News , October 21st . ) Nevertheless , the agitation in the city has assumed such alarming proportions that the Prime Minister , under the pressure not only of public opinion outside the House , but of the Labor party within the House , presented on the 21st of October a plan for their relief : The War Office is authorized to make a special expenditure of ? 200,000 to permit of the enlistment of 24,000 special reservists . A sum of ? 2,500,000 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he employed at dockyard repairs . One million five hundred thousand pounds is to be loaned to local authorities in order to provide work for the unemployed , and the central fund applicable to the same purposes is to be doubled and certain restrictions as to the application of this fund removed . It is , of course , to be regretted that the T IN ENGLAND 1109 unemployed , who ought to be instructed in the arts of peace , should on the contrary be set to work at the art of war . Mr. Asquith , however , prefaced his statement by observing that the measures proposed were essentially emergency measures and were not to prevent the dealing next session with the permanent causes and conditions of unemployment . " 1 ho Mr. Asquith did not say so on this occasion , it has been previously stated that these measures for dealing with permanent causes of unemployment are to be for the further prohibition of child labor , the regulation of sweated trades and compulsory insurance . It is difficult to believe that so well informed a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unemployment by any such superficial measures as these . They are all excellent in themselves . They will trim the luxuriance of the evil and possibly to the same extent strengthen its growth . Ilut English statesmen have always had a genius for never seeing further than the ends of their noses and yet always working in the right direction . By an instinct at once stupid and divine they proceed step by step toward a goal which they profess not to see ; and , if accused of seeing it , they are wont to protest indignantly . The prohibition of child labor and compulsory insurance , while admirable in themselves , will tend toward the creation of an aristocracy of labor , which like the guilds of the Middle Ages only serve to swell everywhere the ranks of the unemployed , and so the condition of unemployment in England is today being used by the Government to increase the army and navy by purely emergency methods , while the only method that would affect any permanent relief , namely , the farm labor colony system , is strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarity with conditions in America , whereas in other respects they are startlingly different . For example , till Parliament past the bill authorizing local governments to make local grants for the unemployed , England shared with us the sinister distinction of being the only nations of the civilized world which had done nothing for the unemployed , and even today it can be said that nothing permanent has been done  |p1110  even in England . It is true , an experiment in the shape of a farm colony has been begun upon a very small scale at Hollesley Bay , and considering the face that the Hollesley Bay plan is in many essential details defective , it is encouraging that it is admitted by all to have produced excellent results . When , however , we compare conditions in England and America on the one hand with conditions in such countries as Germany , Belgium , Holland , France and Switzerland on the other , we have to admit that , so far as the unemployed are concerned , we AngloSaxons rank with Russia , Spain , Tibet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect in the countries above mentioned is so elaborate that it can find no room in this article Moreover , it has been fully written up elsewhere . Again , the London County Council has approved and voted millions to public works which would give employment to thousands of unemployed if it would only take the last step necessary , namely , put the work in execution . New York City finds itself in exactly the same predicament . The Comptroller 's report , publisht in November , 1907 , pages 5 and 6 , shows that the city has not only voted but appropriated over $195,000,000 to public works . Of this much is urgently needed , especially in the Department of Charities ; and yet we are told that owing to constitutional limitations the city can not borrow the money to do this work and so we must do without buildings that are indispensable , and hundreds of thousands of men must remain unemployed . In other respects , however , the conditions in England strangely differ from conditions in America : In England the official returns of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployed , whereas the official returns made to our New York . Labor Department show a percentage of unemployed amounting to no less than 34.7 per cent . These figures are drawn only from the reports of trade unions . Only about one-fifth of the labor population is organized into trade unions , and there is a very much larger percentage of unemployed in unorganized than in organized labor . It is probable , therefore , that the percentage of workingmen , organized and unorganized , at present unemployed is much nearer 50 than 34 per cent . ; and yet , altho the evil of unemployment is in this country four times greater than in England , nevertheless not a thing has been done in this city by way of either permanent or temporary relief ; and altho in England delegations of the unemployed have been received by the city councils of the English municipalities with the utmost courtesy , the Council sometimes rising in their seats to receive them , in New York all the efforts of the unemployed to reach the authorities have failed and all the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response than the policeman 's club . We were told in October , 1907 , that the unemployment was temporary and that it would disappear . A year has elapsed since that time and unemployment is not only as bad but worse than then . For since October $25,000,000 has been withdrawn from the savings banks by workingmen and trade unions ; and the unemployed , therefore , are not only more numerous than they were in October , but they have spent the savings they had put aside to face this very emergency . Again , conditions in America appear to be permanently far worse than they are in England . The report of the Commissioner of Labor of New York State shows that even during periods of prosperity the average amount of unemployment in the trade unions was 16.1 per cent. ; so that in New York we carry even during prosperous years a permanent army of unemployed five times larger than the corresponding quota of unemployed in England under similar conditions . From this point of view , therefore , the necessity of taking permanent measures to relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English cousins , and if the English Departmental Committee reported unanimously in favor of the farm colony plan , it seems reasonable to suppose that it is certainly entitled to some study and consideration over here .
