THE story of the Great Plateau west of the Rocky Mountains is long and varied . It tells of ages in which the world was slowly moulded by fire and flood , and carved by wind and sand and rain . Dry land was conjured from the sea and lifted into vast plateaus ; then torn and tilted and gullied . Life came and traced its record here and there on the pages of the great stone book . The vast table-land is dumb anent the coming of man , but you find the , ruins of his abandoned homes all over its southern reaches and straggling out upon its eastern and its western fringes . Cliff-dwellers and cave- dwellers , dwellers upon lofty mesas and in snug valleys at their feet , all are gone , and their crumbling homes are desolate . It was not until the Spaniards came prying op over the plateau that the Pueblos and other still living types of Indians were dragged . very much against their will , out of the languid prehistoric silences . Then came the conquests by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , followed by a quarter of a century of Mexican rule . At last the Great Plateau , austere as ever , was gathered to the fold of the United States . Its way-side stories , wild , quaint , pathetic , it tells to the wanderer in tune with its spirit along its ancient pathways . It has received the hunter , the trapper , the explorer , into its capacious bosom ? to return or not , as fortune and the Indian willed . The cowboy has spied out its fastnesses ; the railway engineer has marked in toil and hardship the routes along which in later time the tides of life and industry and trade surge to and fro ; the surveyor has projected Ins lines over its arid one hundred and thirty thousand square miles . But the Great Plateau yields grudgingly to the touch of civilization . It grants some meagre green oases beside the waterways . It opens here and there a narrow path for the hurrying trains , closing its great silences behind them as they vanish ; then rolls away their polluting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls asleep again . The part of the plateau which , on the whole , is most attractive to the traveller in the land of wide horizons is that which lies between the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad on the north , and the Santa Fe Railroad and its adjacent country on the south . The Santa Fe crosses the heart of the plateau , over a region austere and forbidding enough , it is true , from the car window , for all its miles of gorgeous cliffs and noble forests , but so lavish in stories of the world 's fashioning , so rich in fading glimpses of strange old barbarians who are gone , so quaintly peopled with kindly children of the earth and the sun , who bid you welcome to homes and firesides where for centuries they have forgathered , a laud withal so attractive for its absolute freedom from fret and fume , where you are the unchallenged owner of the day , that when once you have broken the link which hound you to the rails , and head away into the dreamy shimmering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strange indeed if you do not for some lucid hours care least of alI things whether the fortunes of the way are ever to lead you back . Perhaps the best place , accessible by rail , from which to get a first glimpse of the plateau country and its ruins is the little town of Mancos , iu southwestern Colorado . on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad . An excursion from Mimeos to the Mesa Verde will not only introduce you to the prehistoric ruins of America in their most impressive phases , but will give you a taste of life with a pack-train , and some glimpses of the plateau which will be memorable , wherever and however you have journeyed before , and may entice you to wider ranges in remoter corners of this wonderland . The key to the cliff-dwellers is to he sought in the Pueblo Indians , who may be conveniently visited from points along the line of the Santa Fe Railroad , For the Pueblos are the descendants of the cliff folk ; and if you seek them out in the Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Zuni , or , better still , at the Moitrii villages in Arizona . you will be able to create for yourself a conception of the old barbarian , his ways and habits , his play and his religion , his utensils mind his homes , as the wondering Spaniards saw him three hundred years ago . So when time or whim bid you leave Mancos for fresh fields , you may be impelled to go in quest of the Pueblos . The way leads east and south by rail into the valley of the Rio Grande . The little old Mexican town of EspafioTa is the best place for the tourist to stop , for here he may find simple but wholesome accommodation at the section-house bard by the station , where teams and competent guidance can be secured . The Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande Valley hereabouts are farmers , clinging to their traditional mode of life in quaint adobe houses . On feast and dance days fantastic dress and strange ceremonial reveal the lingering strain of barbarism . A. ramble about San Juan , Santa Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ruins of the towns in the valley are worth a visit . As you look west from Espanola you see a series of long tonguelike mesas , ending in the valley and sloping back to a line of mountain-peaks . These are the Vallee Mountains , and between the long mesas at their feet are many lonesome canyons . Some low green trees . a few struggling pines , grass and cactus , and in the season jaunty flowers , do what they can to hide the sandy reaches of the narrow bottoms , and to lower the glare of the yellow cliffs , which shimmer and scorch in the sun at mid-day . These vivid cliffs are very soft , for they are mostly formed of pumice-stone ? the plaything of some volcanic outburst . If you secure a team and a driver who knows these foot-hills , and climb for a few miles up into one of the canyons above Santa Clara , you will presently stand face to face with some of the most primitive and fascinating deserted homes which are to be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fronts of these winding cliffs , looking out upon the little valleys at their feet , are holes of various shapes , big enough for a man stooping to crowd through , whichlead into little chambers , and often into a connecting series of these clustered around the opening . all pecked out of the soft rock . Many of them are smoke-begrimed still ; in some , mud plaster is yet clinging to the walls . The vivid picture framed by the rude doorway of these rock chambers is most attractive as you look out from their cool recesses upon the hot green and yellow reaches of the valley bottom and the pine-clad slopes beyond , or , if the cave be high , far over the mesa-top to the great bills beyond the Rio Grande . In front of many of the caves piles of hewn stone and timber boles in the cliff show that small buildings were once standing there . Jars and bowls have been found in the recesses of some of the caves ; stone axes and arrowheads and pottery fragments are still plenty along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rocks is plain and frequent . These curious old cave ruins lend themselves so complacently to the dreamy speculation which a noonday rest in the shadow of a pine invites , or to the vagrant faucies which the silence of a night beside them under the stars inspires , that it seems almost a pity to be told that the swarthy fellows down them in the valley of the Rio Grande unfold today the tradition that it was their people , long ago , who in the stress of conflict with alien tribes were forced again and again Lo seek these fastnesses and make shift to carve a shelter in the cliffs . The pottery , the utensils , the masonry , and the pictographs upon the rocks confirm the story . By this easy excursion from Espaliola to the cave-dwellings of the Puye you gain a vivid conception of this curious phase of aboriginal life . Thieve are larger groups of similar dwellings and other strange structures farther south , between the Great White Rock Canyon of the Rio Grande and the mountains , the Painted Cave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cochiti . But the country is wild and rarely visited , except by old Cochiti veterans , who now and then slip away on mysterious errands to these ancestral haunts . When you get home , read that curious archm()logic novel by Bandelier , The Delight-Makers , whose plot is set in the recesses of this gashed mountain-slope , and deals with the loves and lives and customs of the old people who are gone . From these upper reaches of the Rio Grande Valley everything gravitates toward quaint old Santa Fe , whence the road fares westward to the valley of the Rio Grande . At Thornton one so minded may leave the train for the pueblo of Cochiti , a few miles away . On down the valley the train passes close to the pueblo villages of San Domingo , San Felipe , and Sandia . From Bernalillo one may drive up the Jemez Valley and visit the pueblos of Santa Ana , Sia , and Jemez , and the interesting , old ruins on the hills about them ? the wreckage of Spanish conquests in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plateau , here lava - capped , build the western horizon-line . The Sandia . Mountains cut short the vision toward the east . At Albuquerque , the last town of considerable size this side the Pacific , one might outfit a pack-train ? a stout buckboard would answer if one were to return along the same route ? for a journey of several clays up the valley of the Rio Puerco of the East into the heart of the plateau to the Chaco Canyon . Here , prehistoric ruins of great ' communal houses tell of thriving times , of skilful builders , of excellent farmers , in the old days when all the folks were brown and the brown folks owned the earth . Some of these Chaco ruins were explored by the Hyde expedition , whose invaluable collections are deposited in the American Museum of Natural History in New York . A few miles below Albuquerque the railroad crosses the Rio Grande and the Rio Puerco , entering the plateau country , and winds up the valley of the San Jose . To the north rises the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Simpson in 1649 . The San Mateo Mountain is one of the sacred mountains of the Navajos ; and to its summit they , as well as the Pueblo Indians , resort for secret ceremonies , and especially to propitiate and to tell their needs to the Powers which manage rain . I gather from hints , particularly of the Navajos , that the night has veiled many weird ceremonials on this narrow mountain-top , which , as they tell me , are none of the white man 's business . Just at the edge of one of the lava-clad. tongues which the San Mateo Mountain sends into the San Jose Valley , the railroad cuts through the corner of the Pueblo village Laguna . The one little journey from Laguna which above all others will be memorable ends in that fascinating old " City in the Sky , " Aconna , It is about sixteen miles away , the road winding along a wide cliff-girt valley . It is the same old town , perched upon a great sheer-walled mesa standing high out of the valley bottom , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the sand and scrambling over the rocks from Cibola eager for gold . Now at your left the country rises over long timber-clad slopes , which for many miles shut the railroad in against the northern mesas . This is the Zufii Mountain or Plateau . The Zuni pueblo is in a broad brown valley , not so picturesque as Acorns , with a type of face and form , a style of pottery and architecture , and hosts of superstitions all its own . Zufii is the famous Cibola of early Spanish days , but the old site is now in ruins . The Navajo country may be entered from any of the railroad towns upon the south , or from the Memos region on the north . The Navajos are pastoral folk . herding *beep and goats and horses over their great ranges , raising corn and a little grain in the moister bottoms ; living in low earth-covered huts , called hogaus , in the winter , while in the summer they build bough shelters , or wickieups , near their fields and stock-ranges . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are scattered out beyond its borders in all directions . They have always been raiders and plunderers of the Pueblo and Mexican settlements , and are still often aggressive and domineering to their neighbors . The most interesting excursion of all those which may be made is to the faraway Mogul villages ? the ancient Tusayan ? about one hundred miles north , over an arid upland with few watering-places , and at best , in summer , a hot , hard ride . While traces of the Roman Catholic Church are interwoven in very complex fashion with the religious conceptions , and even in some degree with the primitive ceremonials of all the . other Pueblo Indians , the Church has from the first secured but a fitful and superficial foothold among the Moguls . The Moqui man is a genial , hospitable farmer , fun-loving in his way , loyal to his family , and closely linked in act , purpose , and aspiration with potent beings in earth and water and sky , which he consults , worships , placates , holding them in close communion through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed down at last to him . His women folk are comely , the youngsters just playing , shouting , laughing young , stars , in aspect much like others who are white , save for the accident of color and of garb . While the relatively unalloyed traditions of the Moquis offer a field for the ' student of folk-lore among the Pueblo Indians of exceptional extent and value , the ordinary visitor touches but superficially upon the inner life of the people . But certain of the Moqui ceremonials , especially the so-called snake-dance , which is really an elaborate prayer for rain , are so weird and striking that for several years white men have gathered in considerable numbers to witness them . There are seven of the Moqui villages , and at some of these the snake-dance is held each year between the middle and the end of August . But the dance at Walpi , on the East Mesa , which is the most elaborate . most serious , andaltogether most interesting , takes place every other year , in the odd years , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of old Indian trails , and lead by the ancient watering-places , which , until fifty years or so ago , only the red man and the Spaniard knew .
