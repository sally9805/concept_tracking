Methuen &; Co , London , publish directly ' The Monk of Llanthony Father Ignatius , ' by the Baroness de Bertouch , ' Anecdotes of Soldiers , ' by J. H Settle ; and ' Paha and Ponte . ' A Book of Tuscan Games , ' by Dr. W. Heywood , with many illustrations A new and magnificent edition of the German classics is to be published by the Inselverlag of Weimar , and to be called the " Wilhelm-Ernst Ausgabe , " in honor of the young Duke of Saxe-Weimar . A wealthy lover of art has set aside the sum of 10,000 marks for the publication of each volume , with the proviso that a certain portion of the income shall be devoted to the needs of the new Museum in Weimar . The beginning is to be made with Goethe and Schiller , and then ' to be followed by Kleist , Gnillparzer , Hebbel , and others Dr. Edward Everett Hale 's ' Memories of a Hundred Years ' ( Macmillan ) has been reissued in a single volume , with three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so that the professed centennial period of reminiscence is better justified by two years This chapter goes back to childish recollections and early days in the ministry , and contains as suggestive a sentiment as any to be found in the entire work ( p. 317 ) " Speaking to a large audience of young men the other day , I told them that I wished some of them would undertake the serious study of the moral and spiritual effect which what are called mechanical or physical inventions have produced upon the world ' in the last hundred years . . .

The last is a diffuse but not worthless comparison of the modes of public conveyance sixty years ago and to-day , as revealed by Dr. Hale 's diary .

General Grant is hardly more than an excuse for the inflated guide-book entitled ' Along the Nile with General Grant , ' by Elbert E. Farnum , - LL D , formerly United States Consul-General at Cairo ( New York : - The Grafton Press ) . Nearly all the references to him in the index- are stations of the Nile journey The most characteristic trait exhibited  --  that of taking all of a good thing that was offered him  --  appears in his decision to accept the Khedive 's hospitality , " a palace , special trains on the railroad , and a steamer in which to make the voyage up the Nile . " He-first asked advice of the Consul-General , who reported the general opinion of the American colony in Cairo to be that he shciuld accept , but that " Admiral Steadman , who was then on a visit to Egypt , " thought otherwise .

There are numerous half-tone illustrations . Another unconventional guide-book is Three Weeks in Europe- The Vacation of a Busy Man , ' by John V. Higinbotham ( Chicago Herbert S. Stone &; Co ) Its everyday experiences are what one might expect , related without literary skill , but doubtless profitable to somebody . The views are un'hackneyed From Messrs G P Putnam 's Sons we receive a new volume in the " Our European Neighbors " series , viz , ' Swedish Life in Town and Country , ' by 0 G von Heiden-stem A rapid geographical and historical sketch is followed by chapters on goyeinnient , the capital , Stockholm , education , literature , art , industrial life , etc . treated in a competent way within the narrow limits of less than 200 pages . A chapter on " Beneficent Foundations " is given over , almost wholly , to an account of the late Alfred Nobel 's foundation of annual prizes " for the-reward of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' For the benefit of English readers , some of the space might perhaps have been better devoted to other matters of interest . By a slip , the country is made to extend over six and a half degrees of latitude , instead of thirteen and a half ( about 55 20 to 69 N latitude ) , and Venern ( Wener ) is said to be the largest lake in Europe Lakes Ladoga and Onega in Russia are both larger , Venern coming third We have noted a few other inaccuracies which , however , detract but little from the value of a work designed to acquaint the reader having little time to spare with a small nation which once played a considerable part in the history of Europe - ' The Garden of Asia , Impressions from Japan , ' by Reginald J. Ferrer ( London Methuen &; Co ) , is a guide-book in " colored words , " as the author tells us frankly in his preface During an eight months ' stay , he gave himself to the attempt " to translate into hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers to the observant . " His foil is " the three weeks ' sojourner in Yokohama , " and his audience in vision is a very English public . In the main , accurate as to his facts , historical , geographical , and sociological , though with some curious slips , he gives us a feast of rhetoric , but adds little to our knowledge of people or country He visited most of the show places , and his. , repetitious exuberance of description takes the place of insight . He saw only the geisha and the oiraa , but nothing of Japan 's womanhood , yet he discusses forcibly and clearly " The Sphinx in Japan , " largely from his knowledge of Mitford and Chamberlain sympathetic appreciation of the native relegions shows that he can press beyond the symbol to the reality . He had a run into the Korea of- seaports and capital , coming back to the Land of Beauty and Mystery with keener susceptibilities . - In reprinting - in separate form as a book of some 550 pages his ' Life of William Shakspere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally written to accompany the New Century edition of Shakspere 's Works , Dr William J Rolfe has been well advised , for he thus makes more accessible a work of considerable merit , which may stand as a monument in an honorable career of labor devoted largely to Shaksperian studies . Dr. Rolfe 's biography of the great dramatist impresses us as older-fashioned in many ways than the recent ones by Sidney Lee and George Brandes , less inclined to new conjecture and hypothesis-framing , but perhaps none the less meritorious on that account . We wish that of the eight pictorial illustrations the two which are mere fancy sketches had been omitted To a different class , namely , that of books of " Illustrations " of Shakspere , like that of Hunter , belongs ' William Shakespeare His Family and Friends , ' by the late C I Elton ( E P Dutton &; Co . ) .

Considerable portions are but repetition of often-stated facts , but there as some new material , and tradition and evidence are sifted with lawyer-like sagacity The facts bearing upon Shakspere 's , family and property relations are especially well grasped and analyzed Other things treated by way ' of illustrations are Howell 's Letters , Ward 's Diary , and ( de cape ) the whole question of the date and circumstances of the production ' of " The Tempest " In both substance and style it is a rich and thoroughly attractive volume The scholar who has long labored in the paths of soberness and method ' can not but feel drawn now and then to ease his mind in the lighter ways of popularization and the essay style Professor Schelling has - won a name for himself as a serious student of Elizabethan literature .

We have noted , however , at least one se-/ions mistake It is not true that in English society the newcomer " calls first on the residents of the place " ( p. 25 ) . If the path of the parvenu were thus made easy , - what English county family would be safe ? On page 51 Miss Clapp gives what she considers the correct form for that bugbear of the illiterate , a letter in the third person 11 er model composition runs smoothly as far as the second sentence , and then comes the familiar lapse .

For the rest , we can only say that a household that should be run on the lines laid down in Mite ? Carter 's little book would realize even the ideal of the Chicago millionaire who dreamed of home life without friction , and decided that to eliminate this would be worth , to him at any rate , a million dollars .

" One sheet at once bears the title , ' American Interior Decoration , ' and the list of illustrations , and on the back a brief publisher 's note , giving credit to the furniture dealers , decorators , and business houses which deal in matter of decoration , for somewhat less than half of the fifty-five pictures . The reader who will imagine a collection made tip from the newly opened Hotel St Regis and the only less renowned Hotel Astor , three or four stage settings , half a ' score of exhibits at St. Louis , several saloons made up in the shops of prominent furniture dealers , and " a Minnee apolis decorator 's version of Japanese , " will be able to form a fair notion of the sort of book that we have here Obviously , no one of the designs can be of any considerable artistic interest .

Longmans , Green &; Co. publish ' An Attempt towards a Chemical Conception of the Ether , ' by D Mendeldeff , translated from the Russian by George Kamensky There is nothing new in the idea that the ether may be a chemical body . Mendeleeff 's turn of mind would naturally lead him to favor this view ; but it cannotbe denied that a review of the history of scientific hypotheses will show that it has been conceptions of this character  --  the realistic character  --  in favor of which experiment has usually decided . It is an , interesting fact , too , that a man of Mendeleeff 's surpassing sagacity should be so decided as he appears to be that , if the ether is a chemical body , it is an unmixed element of the helium-argon group It has long been as good as known that coronium , whose spectrum was so magnificent in the eclipse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably lighter than hydrogen . Mendeleeff says its atomic weight " will be not greater than 0.4 ; and probably Iess " This would make its density one-fifth that of hydrogen or one-seventieth of the air 's He makes it similar to neon , which , with little reason , - he separates slightly from helium , argon , krypton , and xenon  --  that is , he separates it as much as sodium is separated from lithium , potassium , rubidium , and cmsium . J. Clark Murray 's ' Introduction to Psychology ' ( Boston Little , Brown &; Co. ) is simply our old favorite , the same author 's well-known and approved ' Handbook , ' in a new dress . The author thinks that so many parts - have been so completely rewritten that " it would have been misleading to describe it as a new edition of the old work " Many will hold quite the reverse opinion . We do not remark-much retraction , and the enlargements amount , we should judge , to some 6 per cent of the contents ; certainly not to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious , and in half a ? dozen cases , at most , important ; but the original dress of the book was far more graceful and more likely to prove engaging to young persons The new ' Introduction ' is , however , welcome .

If the student goes through these and makes sure of perfectly familiarizing himself with every aspect of one point before going on to the next , and not fatiguing himself , we see no reason for his finding this doctrine , so useful as it often is , and so sure of enlarging the mind , at all beyond his grasp We regret that the limits of the roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the French African army has published a large chart in seventeen sheets covering the larger portion of French Africa . But as this is still defective , giving only the itineraries , it has been decided to prepare a large chart on the scale of 1 500,000 , to consist of at least sixty parts . Special investigations are now being madefor this purpose in the lower Senegal districts , in the peninsula of Gape Verde , Dakar , and elsewhere . It will take many years to complete the work . The next region to be undertaken Is the neighborhood of Saint Louis , and an expedition is being prepared for the Ivory Coast ' Liberia is in an extremely primitive condition , judging from the account by our minister , Mr. Ernest Lyon , of a recent journey into the interior published in the Consular Reports There are no roads , and the means of communication between the villages " in the dense forests or upon the tops of steep hills " are paths made crooked and labyrinthine to render access difficult . This is due mainly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars of which " women are invariably the cause . " The land has great natural resources . The forests abound in rich and valuable timber . Mineral wealth is abundant Cotton is indigenous , and the soil is peculiarly adapted to the growth of coffee But these sources of prosperity and wealth are largely undeveloped , and in some instances , like that of- coffee culture , the amount and value of the ' crop are diminishing . The whole foreign trade in 1902 was only about half a million dollars ( $525,974 ) , or one hundred thousand resY than in 1899 ( 8,646,616 ) . It is a significant fact , mentioned in another report , which in some measure accounts for the lamentable decadence , that " almost every Liberian meaning an American negro or his descendant is a Government official .

The editor has added a multitude of cases ( some ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room has done much in the way of omission and condensation . Nearly a third of the book is new . Mr. Pomeroy was one of the last of the legal writers of what may be called the old American school  --  men whose aim was nothing more spectacular or novel than the plain exposition of the law as they found it . The system of code remedies was fortunate , in the days when-the Code itself was still a novelty , in finding in him an expounder of the first order of ability , unprejudiced and lucid in a most difficult and technical field , On the first appearance of the book thirty years ago it was found to explain the newly introduced system so clearly and forcibly ( Mr Pomeroy 's style was admirably adapted to his work ) that it was at once welcomed by the bench and the - profession , and - accepted as an authoritative treatise , and it has held its own . Professor Bogle 's conscientious and thorough - revision probably , guarantees it a prolonged life . He is , we believe , an acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen on almost every page . Such a revision , if successful , reclbunds almost equally to the credit of author and editor . ? Another law-book , published by the same house , which ' deserves more than ordinary notice , is a work In one volume by Alfred G. Reeves on ' Real Property . ' The author calls it a " treatise on special subjects of the law of Real ' Property , " but this is too modest a title , for it contains an outline of all real-property law ; together with more detailed treatment of those special subjects , such as fixtures , easements , tenures , uses , trusts , powers , mortgages and Perpetuities , which occasion most controversy and litigation . Unless we are mistaken , the student and practitioner will find here in a single volume what it in 61- - ficult to get elsewhere in any number of volumes  --  a rationale of real-property law , with enough of history to make its development intelligible , combined with anexposition of its application to every-day questions of the knottiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been struck in looking , for instance , at what the author says about mortgages , to see how clearly he manages to bring us through the confusion of the cases Real-property law has at its base a rounded , logical system , but it is ? at the same time a branch of law developed historically , and much changed in the process of evolution . What is needed for its comprehension is just such treatment as Mr. Reeves 's , but few writers have the skill , the time or patience for it . We can well believe that the treatise , which is sure to make its mark , is the result of Years devoted to the instruction of classes in the subject ? Philosophers as a body have always shown a strange indifference or covert hostility towards questions concerning the future life , and accordingly have contributed little to our reflections , and nothing to our knowledge , on the subject With the glorious exception of Plato , few indeed among them could , at least until quite recently , ? lay claim to any serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore the more noteworthy that the richly endowed and versatile nature of Fechner made him one of the very few thinkers of the first rank who have found time for thought on such topics , and the translation of his ' Little Book of Life after Death ' ( Boston Little , Brown &; Co ) should undoubtedly be welcomed Written so long ago as 1835 , under the pseudonym of " Dr. Mises , " by which Fechner emancipated his more humanly interesting writings from the restrictions of academic etiquette , it has now been agreeably translated by Mary C Wadsworth Prof William James has helped the reader with ten charming pages of introduction to a kindred soul , caking Fechner " a Herbert Spencer , no less encyclopaedic , and more subtle , . . who mingled humor and lightness with his heavier ratiocinatons .

Dr Carl Peters , the African explorer , has just published in ' England and die Englander ' ( Lemcke &; Buechner ) , the results of observations made during a ten years ' residence in England . What he has to say is interesting and entertaining , and to his countrymen should be instructive . He makes frequent comparisons between Germany and England , not always favorable to the former . While he agrees that in the - matter - of army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans , he considers that in many other fields Germany has much to learn from England A good deal of statistical information of recent date he intersperses with many details concerning the daily life and the social customs of various classes of English society , referring always to corresponding conditions in his own country . In the main , his views show him to be a man of unusual intelligence - and experience , but his-career as a German colonizing pioneer apparently gives him a strong bias in favor of British imperialism , and leads him to express the opinion that Mr Chamberlain 's policy is bound to prevail as the only means of maintaining the supremacy of England His forecast of the future seems to be a customs union of England and her colonies , with which he even believes the United States would be willing to join , and in. opposition to which Continental Europe will be compelled to organize a central Zollverein of its own .
