THE power possessed by the lodeor natural magnet , of attracting iron and of taking up its position in a northward and southward direction , is supposed to have been first discovered by the Chinese . Indeed , according to Eastern tradition , the magnet was used as a guide in travelling by the Chinese monarch Hoang-ti in the twenty-seventh century sm. ? that is to say , some 4600 years ago . Be this as it may , it is certain that at least as far back as the beginning of the Christian era the Chinese had a contrivance which they called " tchi-a an , " which . practically means " a south-indicating car . " This is supposed to have been a coach or wagon , in the upper part of which was fixed a vessel containing a magnet. , or magnetic needle , floating freely in water . The needle was attached to the arm of a diminutive human figure , and by maintaining its position notwithstanding the motion of the vehicle , it caused the arm of the figure to point constantly towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that artificial magnets could be produced by simply rubbing a piece of iron with lodestone , and they were also aware , by at latest the eleventh century of our era , that the position taken up by a magnetic needle is not necessarily exactly northward and southward . The Frenchman Biot , who was a most eminent mathematician and scientist at the time of Waterloo , quotes the following interesting passage from a Chinese author of the eleventh century as descriptive of the ancient Chinese method of preparing the magnetic needle . Those who perform the trick rub the needle with a ma ? - net stone then it will mark the south : it will , however , decline always a little toward the east . It does not exactly indicate the south . When such a needle floats on water it is very much agithe needle pointed to the east of north , its direction in 1550 ? the date of the earliest observation recorded ? having been 11 ? 13 ' to the east of north . It would appear that this easterly variation was then increasing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 17 ' E. About that date , however , the needle certainly began to move westward . It attained the true north in 1657 , but continued its westward movement till 1818 , when it had a westerly variation of 24 ? 38 ' 25 " . In 1.818 it began to move towards the east , and its easterly movement still continues , there being still , however , a westerly variation of nearly 16 ? . It has been calculated that the needle in London will once again indicate the true north in or about the year 1973 . It is supposed that in 1561 ) the needle had in London its greatest easterly variation , and we know that in 1818 it had its greatest westerly variation . This makes the time occupied in the swing from one extreme to the other 258 years , which would make the period of the complete movement about 516 years . In New York the swing of the needle is very much less than in London . The complete period there is calculated to be about 240 years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north . The direction indicated by the compass needle at New York is estimated to vary from 4 ? 43 ' west of north to about 9 ? west of north . The needle was in its most easterly position ( 4 ? 43 ' W. ) in 1803 , and since then the westerly variation has continued to increase . It is supposed that the needle will attain its most westerly position in or about the year 1923 . Thus in London the needle is at present moving eastward , while in New York it is moving westward . The movement of the needle in these two cities is illustrative of what occurs all the world over , the action in no two places on the surface of the globe being exactly similar in all respects to each other . Besides changing constantly in its relation to the cardinal point ? a change which is known as the declination , or , as we have called it , the variation ? the needle has another and quite dissimilar movement . This is the movement of dip , or inclination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibiting the dip through the method in which it is fixed . In order that the dip may be evident , the needle has , of course , to be so adjusted as to have freedom of movement in deviating from the horizontal . In the tropics there is an irregular belt around the earth , partly to the north and partly to the south of the equator , in all parts of which there is no dip . This is the magnetic equator . To the north of the magnetic equator the north-indicating end of the needle dips , and to the south of the magnetic equator the south-indicating end of the needle dips , the dip in each ease increasing with separation from the magnetic equator and approach to the magnetic pole . At the magnetic pole the dipping needle takes up a vertical position . The action of the needle as regards dip in different geographical positions is , in fact , exactly similar to the corresponding action of a suspended magnetic needle when moved along above a magnetized bar . The earliest record of the dip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dip was then 71 ? 50 ' , and it was increasing . The greatest dip appears to have been attained in or about the year 1723 , when it was 74 ? 42 ' . Since then the clip has been slowly decreasing , and it is now about 66 ? 55 ' . There is some reason , through the lessening amount of the annual movement , to believe that the dip is now at or near its turning-point . Similar changes in the dip of the needle perhaps more marked , perhaps less marked ? occur all over the globe , the magnetic equator , or region of no dip , not being definitely fixed on the earth 's surface , but itself subject to slight change of position . Besides the change in declination and dip , there is another inconstant " element , " as it is called , in connection with terrestrial magnetism . This is the intensity or force of the magnetism which affects the needle . It is indicated by the vibrations of the needle , when diverted from its true direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of its effort , when diverted , to return to its natural position . Thus , the position taken by the magnetic needle is subject to change in horizontal direction , in dip , and in intensity , the eyek of which in general occupies centuries , although the periods differ in every separate locality . Not only is this so , the needle also has a corresponding daily movement , which is subject to seasonal variation , and the characteristics of these short-period movements are also locally diverse from each other . In London at present , as we have seen , the needle points about 16 ? to the westof north , and the dip is about 66 ? 55 ' . If we take these figures as absolutely correct for the mean position , it will be the case that during certain hours daily the needle will point slightly more than 16 ? to the west of north , and that during part of the day the dip will be slightly more than 66 ? 55 ' : while at other times daily the westerly deflection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , although imperceptible , it must be the case that at present the daily swing of the needle in London is , on the average , infinitesimally greater towards the east than towards the west , and towards the horizontal than towards the vertical , seeing that secularly the westerly variation and the dip are both now decreasing . About 11 A.m. ( local time ) the needle in London in its small daily swing points nearest to the true north . As the variation is at present westerly , this , of course , means that the needle then attains its easterly extreme for the day . The needle then begins to move towards the west , and this westward movement continues until about 7 P.m . About that hour the movement is reversed , and the needle then moves towards the east until about 11 A.M. next day . The daily movement in London covers about thirty-four minutes of the arc of the circle in summer and about twenty-three minutes in winter . Corresponding movements of the needle occur all over the earth , but the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daily swing , and the constancy of the movement vary in different localities . In low latitudes a slight intermediate reversal of the movement is not uncommon . In general it may be said that the extent of the swing is least at and near the region of the magnetic equator , and increases with separation from that region . The daily change of the dip in London is , on the mean , about five and a half minutes of arc , the dip being least at about 6 A , M. , and greatest at about 3 P.M. The daily change in the dip . like the daily change in the variation , is greater in summer than in winter . Doubtless this is also the case with the intensity , or force , although fluctuations in this element of terrestrial magnetism are peculiarly difficult of observation . What , then , are the causes of these mysterious movements of the magnetic needle with their daily , seasonal , and secular characteristics ? There can be little doubt that the inquirers must at a very early date have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed by the magnetic needle must flow from the earth itself . The whole circumstances indicate that this must be the case . This , then , being accepted , the fact that the needle was liable to be deflected by the proximity of any other magnet , whether natural or artificial , and could he made to follow the movement of the magnet , would naturally suggest that the earth , in causing the needle to take up a certain position in relation to the cardinal points , and to vary in dip with geographical situation , was really acting on the needle exactly like another magnet . The conclusion necessarily followed that the earth itself must either lie a magnet or must contain within it a great magnet or combination of magnets . Thus a fascinating and puzzling problem would , by a natural and simple train of reasoning , be presented to those interested in the discovery of natural laws . Dr. William Gilbert , physician to 1 Queen Elizabeth , was one of those who electricity , discovered that magnetism is energetically induced in iron or steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire and an electric current is caused to flow through the wire . The process adopted was to coil the wire from an electric battery around a glass tube , place the needle which it was desired to magnetize inside the tube , and then pass the current . The needle is thus immediately magnetized , the magnetization being temporary in the case of iron , but permanent in the ease of steel . It was found that the nature of the poles formed in the extremities of a needle magnetized in this way depended on the manner in which the enclosing wire was spirally wound . Supposing the tube to be in a vertical position , with the wire coiled from top to bottom , and the current caused to traverse the coil from the top downwards , it was found that if , in its descending spiral course on the tube , the wire passed from right to left on the side of the tube turned towards the operator , the south-indicating pole of the magnetized needle occurred at the upper extremity , the north-indicating pole at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passed around the tube from left to right , the conditions otherwise being unchanged , the north-indicating pole was formed at the upper end of the needle , and the south-indicating pole at the lower end . It was thus found that the deciding cause as to which end of the needle was to point northward depended entirely on the apparently insignificant detail whether the course of the encircling electric current was right to left or left to right . If , now , the earth is magnetized by electric currents passing from east to west , as suggested by Barlow , are such currents of the right to left or the left to right description ? It will be seen at once by a glance at a globe or map that an east to west movement of an electric current on the earth is exactly equivalent , as seen from outer space , to a right to left passage of the flow of electricity . Thus , electric currents passing around the earth from east to west would , as in the case of the magnetization of the needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or north of the earth of a south-indicating pole , and at the " bottom " or south of the earth of a north-indicating pole . Now , as is well known , one of the first principles of magnetism is that unlike poles attract , and like poles repel . Consequently a south-indicating pole at the north of the earth would attract the north-indicating end of the needle , and a north-indicating pole at the south of the earth the south-indicating end of the needle . Thus , the existence of such electric currents , as Barlow surmised , would , if the substance of the earth be magnetizable , exactly meet the conditions required to induce the magnetic needle to take up its position , generally speaking , northward and southward , and would be consistent also with the needle 's directive tendency as regards its converse poles . Since Barlow 's time it has been discovered that when the sensitive magnetic needles of the observatories exhibit the tremulous agitation which is recognized as indicating the occurrence of what is called a " magnetic storm " there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aurora and conspicuous spots on the sun . It has also been ascertained that the sun-spot period of about eleven years is recognizable in connection with magnetic disturbances . These facts have been accepted as proving , what other facts also indicate , that solar action is intimately associated with terrestrial magnetism . The advances in electrical science , in its relation to nature , have of late years brought many to believe that the sun is our great storehouse of electricity : that the ether of surrounding space is electric in character , and that electricity itself may even he atomic in structure . Thus the sun , in pouring out light and heat , is believed to be also pouring out electricity , or electric energy , to all surrounding space . Whether in the form of waves of the surrounding ether or of physical particles , this electrical stream flows on to the earth on the side of the globe which is exposed to the sun . As the earth in its daily motion rotates eastward , causing the sun apparently to pass around the earth daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity is caused to wind constantly around the earth in a westward direction , a coil , so to speak , being completed in each daily rotation . Thus the magnetization of the earth very probably results in a manner exactly analogous to that employed when a needle is magnetized by an electric current through a right-handed spiral coil . The writer , in a small volume on this subject , issued in 1905 , took occasion to point out the close similarity which the magnetization of the earth , in the manner indicated , bears to the method discovered by Arago and Ampere of magnetizing iron or steel by means of an electric current . A copy of the book was presented to the distinguished physicist whose recent death the scientific world continues to deplore . In acknowledging the volume , Lord Kelvin took occasion to state very briefly his attitude in reBard to the recent progress of this branch of natural science . His letter is as follows : is EATON PLACE , S.W. , z7th Oct ? 1905 . DEAR thank you for the copy of your hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has long seemed to many , and seems to be your opinion also , that terrestrial magnetism is attributable to influences connected with the rotary motion of the earth and ether . But present knowledge does not suffice to found any definite theory on that idea . Yours truly , KELVIN . From this view no careful inquirer can dissent . The facts , so far as known , suggest , but they by no means prove , that the earth is magnetized in the manner described ? that is , through solar-electric influence in association with the earth 's rotation . There would seem to be reason for believing , at least tentatively , ( 1 ) that the earth in its physical structure consists to such an extent of magnetizable material that it is capable , as a whole , of being converted into a magnet ; ( 2 ) that an electrical stream , or current , is received by the earth on the side exposed to the sun , which , through the earth 's rotation , is coiled around the earth from east to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) that the conversion of the earth into an electro-magnet in this manner is the cause of the directive tendency of the magnetic needle , both in declination and dip ; while the diversities and peculiarities connected with the method of magnetization are the cause of the constant changes and anomalies in the movements of the needle ; and ( 4 ) that the method of magnetization , and the character of the exposure of the earth to the sun , and the irregularities of the earth itself in both form and composition , are the causes which decide the position of the terrestrial magnetic poles and equator , and the changes which occur in relation thereto . It might not unreasonably be supposed that the attraction exercised by the earth on the magnetic needle , or , we may say , on any magnet , whether great or small , would have a bearing on terrestrial gravity . We can well imagine that a magnetic bar under terrestrial attraction would require the exercise of greater power to keep it away from the attracting earth than a similar bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetization . This , however , is not the case . . A magnetic needle , or magnetized bar , or any similar magnetic body , is so infinitely small compared with the earth that the earth 's magnetism acts on it as a " couple , " ? that is to say , two opposite forces are in operation at the same time , counteracting each other so far as interference with gravity is concerned , so that only the directive influence has full effect . We may suppose that the north magnetic pole is drawing the north-indicating end of the needle northward and repelling the opposite end with exactly the same force as the south magnetic pole is drawing the south - indicating end of the needle and repelling the north-indicating end . To take an extreme case , suppose the needle to be suspended at the north magnetic pole , and this to be as far as possible away from the influence of the opposing power , then the north magnetic pole will certainly attract the north-indicating end of the needle with great effect , but with similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in this case gravity will be quite unaffected .
