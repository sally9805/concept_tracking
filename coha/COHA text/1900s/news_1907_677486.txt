txt One of the features of the trial of Harry K. Thaw for the murder of Stan , . ford White which has been most productive of theories , has been the daily presence in court of the District Attorney 's alienists , Dr. Austin Flint , Dr. Carlos ' F. , and Dr. William H. Mabyri . While nothing has been seen in court of the alienists engaged by the defense , the prosecution 's men attend every session of the court , studying the prisoner , about the nature of whose defense to the charge nothing is yet certain . A TIMES reporter carried to Clifford W. Hartrldge yesterday one of the theories most generally adopted by those who know most about the Thaw case . " There Is a report , " said the reporter to Mr. Hartridge , " that Thaw is suffering from incipient paresis and that before the final stage of this legal battle for his life is reached the disease will have progressed to such a point that he can not be put to death under the law , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trial on the chance of an acquittal . " That is a hypothetical question , " replied Mr. Hartridge . ' " What do you think of the constant presence of Mr. Jerome 's alienists ? " he was asked . " We might have our alienists present , " was the reply . " But the report has it that your defense is really based on the probable long delay in the final adjudication of the case and a consequent total mental collapse of your client , " the reporter said . " What we are anxious for , " said Mr. Hartridge , " is a quick trial . We want to get Thaw out of jail . " " What do you think of Howard Nesbit , the brother of Mrs. Harry Thaw , as a witness ? " he was asked . " We are not worried about him , " he ? replied . " Is it not rather out of the ordinary that May , a witness subpoenaed by the prosecution , should be living with the wife of the man accused ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the District Attorney will call her and put her on the stand ? " he asked . Mr. Hartridge said that as far as he knew , there was no quarrel in the Thaw family over the presence of the chorus girl chum of the prisoner 's wife in court . Ho said that Mr. Delmas , who wasj brought from California to make the speech In ' gumming up the case for the defense , had not threatened to withdraw from the case . So far as he knew , he said , the Thaw family had not quarreled over the presence of May In the courtroom . Miss said over the telephone in the afternoon that she intended to be in court on Monday . Mr. Hartridge said yesterday that the Countess of Yarmouth had asked him if it was necessary for her to be present every I day in court , and that he had told her it I was not . " She has a very bad cold , " said Mr. Hartridge , explaining the absence of the Countess . Mr. Hartridge and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their office at 140 Broadway in the afternoon . Mr. Peabody conferred with Thaw in , the morning . Mr. Delmas was laid up with a cold . Dan O'Reilly spent a part of the morning in talking with Mr. , who is the California partner of Mr. Delmas . Thaw is following closely all the newspaper accounts of the progress of his trial . He left his cot early in the morning and hurried to the shower bath as soon as the regulations of the prison permitted him to . Then he asked that his counsel should be sent to him as soon as he arrived . He was plainly disturbed by the stories in the papers that there had been a quarrel in his family . There was also a report that Thaw had received many letters of a threatening nature , but Mr. Peabody knew nothing of any such letters and the prison attaches who have been detailed to read Thaw 's mail also knew nothing of them . In the early afternoon Thaw , who was still busy reading the accounts of his trial , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Mrs. Thaw came to the Tombs alone . She had only been with her husband for a few minutes when the prisoner 's mother and his brother , Josiah , called . Mrs. William Thaw stood a short distance away while her daughter-in-law finished her conversation with her husband . The Tombs keepers say that there was not much cordiality shown between the former artist 's model and the mother of her husband . Josiah Thaw , heavy of brow and firm of mouth , waited patiently until the interview was over . Then he talked with his brother for a while , and then assisted his mother from the building . Mrs. Thaw leaned heavily on the arm of her son , and as they faced the gathering of camera men outside the prison she hid her face behind her muff . " That is n't our cab , " she said to her son , as they slowly felt their way down the slippery steps leading from the Tombs . It was the cab which was waiting for her daughter-in-law . Josiah Thaw pushed his way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes had his mother 's cab ready for her . Before Mrs. Harry Thaw entered her cab she was asked if her sister-inlaw , the Countess of Yarmouth , had decided to return to England because of her friendship for May . Mrs. Thaw put her finger to her lips and shook her head to signify that she would nolt discuss the report . Howard Nesbit , who was educated by Stanford White . and is here as a witness for the prosecution , was in the Criminal Courts building yesterday , and he said that he thought his sister , Evelyn , was making a great mistake in having May in court with her every day . Young Nesbit came to the Court House to talk with Assistant District Attorney Garvan , who is helping Mr. Jerome in the case . He was accompanied by . narlee Hartnutt , who was Mr. White 's private secretary . Mr. Jerome did not leave his office yesterday . He was busy . talking with the alienists who are studying Thaw . It was said yesterday that Mr. Jerome would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that one thing to be brought out would be documentary evidence that the board of May and her living expenses have been paid by some one connected with the- Thaws since the killing of White . At the time of the killing of White , when Evelyn Nesbit Thaw hunted up her old friend to seek refuge with her , May kept an establishment in West Forty-ninth Street . The house is a threestory brownstone residence , and the onetime Weber &; Field chorus girl is said to have taken lodgers there . Since the tragedy she has been living at the Hotel Lorraine with Thaw 's wife . The jurors in the Thaw case occupy a suite of rooms on the third foolr of the Broadway Central Hotel . They have comfortable beds , a private dining room , ana a room in which they may gather and chat or play games . " They ca n't play for money , " said Capt . Lynch , who is in charge of the guard , yesterday . " And they always have a pitcher of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even a I bottle of beer at dinner . "
