THE state insurance is the big fact in Germany . Six out of nine of all those who work for wages are sure by law of an income and doctor 's care if they are ill ; three out of four when they are old or unable to work ; and every man , woman , and child , except in a few isolated classes of workers , in cases of accidents met with in their trades . The Germans are a thinking people ; they think for the world , and all of us go to school to them , and this great social project they have thought into existence . and made it a fact which we have come to uphold in the world ? that it is the function of the state to guard against want in its members , as well as against ignorance and attack . It used to be enough for a man that the state kept him from being killed ; now education , it is our brag and boast , that we have come to assume ; and Germany has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years before Finland and Norway , seventeen years before France , nineteen before England . and no one knows how long before America . The insurance project is chilling as Germany carries it out . It is part , of the bureaucratic system of Prussia , too much a thing of salaries and officials , of files of papers laid in rows by office-boys morning by morning , a principle meditated by statesmen , hundreds of handsome bureaus . But the idea , Germany has resolved into a fact , and made a part of state polity . A revolution is accomplished , not when performance is adequate , but when , as Lassalle says , an entirely new principle is made to take the place of the existing order of things . Nobody looks upon the laws as otherwise than in a state of solution , certainly not the men who are trying by their scholarly investigation of conditions , their experiments , and international congresses , to make of a conviction a working system . The project is less thanthirty years old ; it had no precedents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of working-people . Many changes have been made in the measures since they were passed . Old-age pensions begin now at seventy instead of seventy-five , and the age may soon be reduced five years more . Very detailed regulations as to the treatment of patients in hospitals have been incorporated in the accident law . Sickness insurance can be drawn for twenty-six weeks a year instead of thirteen as in the original measure . Many classes of workers have been added to those originally required to insure . Some are still unreached . Only part of the agricultural class comes under the present statute , and house servants only for invalidity , though most house servants have sickness insurance , taken out by employers voluntarily . The two further laws which will complete the chain , are under debate in the Reichstag year by year , one to provide annuities for widows and orphans , under some such conditions as the accident law now provides for the families of victims of accidents , and a second for insurance against want of work . In the years when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . It was believed that the expected development of industry would take care of the workless . The aim was only to protect invalids . But the question of the unemployed has continued to press upon Germany , as it does upon every industrial country for at least a third of the year . Every year the Socialist wing in the Reichstag brings forward the bills for the workless and for widows and orphans , and it is known that the government waits only a further tariff income before undertaking these new measures . It is interesting to observe the cordial attitude of Germany toward this present legislation , and to consider what would have been the latter 's reception thirty years ago . The insurance is now for accident , for sickness , and for old age and invalidism . The laws for accident are perhaps the most radical of the group , because they provide that pensions shall be maintained by employers alone , upon the principle , still strange to our thoughts , that accidents are an inherent feature of industry and intist be considered part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , pay all accident pensions , each member being assessed pro rata , according to the amount of wages and salaries paid during the . year , and in proportion to the risk of his enterprise , which is much greater of course in partly patriarchal industries like agriculture and forestry than in milling and manufacturing , where precautions are more carefully taken , apprenticeship is more guarded , and organization of labor more powerful . This liability , placed not upon one single employer , but upon the total number of employers belonging to an association , has brought about a great increase of precautionary machinery in Germany , especially in the smaller shops . It being to the interest of trades associations to reduce as far as possible the number of accidents , employers are compelled under high assessments from their own body to adopt measures of safety and to enforce the fines against recklessness of workmen . In the year-books of such great trades associations as that of the chemical industry one sees discussion and illustrations , of every piece of machinery for protection , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like that for sickness and old age , was forced upon the state as a political measure . By the old Roman law- a working-man or his family had got indemnity in Germany , if he were hurt or killed in the chances of his trade , only from the person through whose carelessness or malice he had suffered . The injured person had always to prove the fault ; the immediate . author of the disaster , often an overseer or fellow workman , was the only person who could be held , so that a man came away more often than not with empty bands , even if be won his suit , because of the poverty of the responsible party . An employer could be held only if neglectcould he laid directly to his charge , and it was not established what was neglect and discharge of duty in an employer . A first law , intended to meet the cases of railway employees , held the employer for all neglect of his overseers ; another , over thirty years later ( 1871 ) , held him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workman 's , the burden of proof being thus transferred to him . Both laws were evaded ; in the Reichstag handbook one reads of a debate in 1879 in which a great mine-owner admitted that of 7,373 accidents which lied come to his notice , only 1,251 ? about onesixth ? had received redress . The chief problem with which the young empire was face to face in those first years of its life was the friction between the laboring and employing class . It must have a kind of unity if it was to live , and in this cause the government intervened , and passed in 1883 the first of the present laws , under which inquiry is excluded ? indemnity being granted irrespective of the culpability or innocence of either party . Though a man has himself dropped upon the floor the oil upon which he slips into a machine , his compensation is assured . The pension is , in ' amount , two-thirds of wages if a man is completely disabled , the loss of one-third being appraised as the expenses he would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his chances of being workless . Partial accidents have partial indemnity ; and in case of death a family may receive as much as sixty per cent . of wages , a wife until she remarries , children until they are fifteen , and all others dependent upon his labor for maintenance , with the reservations which belong to measures of law . It is a comment upon the temper of the German mind that in England the trades-unions oppose the passage of such regulations , since they have the process of suit so perfected that they often get as indemnity the whole of wages , whereas in Germany the pension , though assured , is never more than part . The sickness and old-age insurance is borne by employer and employed together . Employers pay one-third of the premium for sickness ; the contribution for old age and invalidity is charged half to each . the state adding , moreover $12.50 yearly to every pension for old age or invalidism . It has been estimated that the contribution made by employers to the three classes of insurance amounts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by working-people to a one and a half per cent . to three per cent . deduction of earnings . The employer is responsible for the full payment of premium , which he takes from the amount of wages and enters in the insurance-book in the form of stamps . The post-office is the medium of payment for both premiums and pensions ? an expedient which was the occasion of much throwing about of wit when the " Sticker Acts " were under debate . Every housemaid in Germany puts a stamp in her book every week and her mistress puts another . and she goes to the hospital if she is ill , not as a recipient of charity , but with the same legal right to its benefits that she had to those of the public school . The sickness insurance is that which one sees " in the largest way of practice . " In the year 1907 five million people drew it , being paid for an average of nineteen days for each case . The pension means a doctor 's care or care in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents to a dollar and a half a week for the family of the incumbent , according as the class in which he is insured provides . No case is too inconsequent for payment . A man or woman who must he fitted with spectacles draws the allowance for a day and has glasses free of charge . The law makes no distinction of persons , since it is a public social measure , and the young apprentice with tuberculosis , who may be invalided within a few months , begins his insurance under the universal conditions . The project commands the best hospitals and associations for the furtherance of public health . The finest tuberculosis hospital I perhaps in the world has been built from the insurance fund , and many smaller ones , as well as barracks in pine forests and in the mountains , wage the war of civilization against consumption . Even the question of housing has been made to come within the province of the measures . To prevent illness and invalidism , loans are made at a low interest to cooperative building associations for model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out exhaustive yearly reports of tenement-house conditions . Like the accident insurance , sickness insurance has been a delicate instrument of leverage to better labor conditions . The sickness law makes no stipulations as to the means of insurance . Groups of allied industries have , therefore , formed themselves voluntarily into clubs acting in most cities very little in concert , but in a few ? Leipzig , Dresden , and in Vienna ? since Austria has followed the example of Germany closely ? the Krankenkassen have a highly centralized organization , which has in one city its own physician to inspect factories under its jurisdiction and keep them to a certain standard . When a superintendent in a blacklisted factory asks , " What is wrong with ns ? The government inspector was here last month and reported us favorably , " the answer is : " There were eight more accidents here last month than at the Zaeher works , eighteen more cases of sickness . You had better look into the Zacher plants . " Old-age and invalidity insurance is one , old age being regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while an invalidity pension is conditional upon incapacity to work . old-age pensions are intended as subsidies for all old workmen , to supplement reduced earning power . Both are about the same in amount as sickness pensions , end a man begins to draw his old-age allowance when he is seventy years old , and that for invalids when he is unable to earn one-third of his former income , always after a certain number of years of contribution . The administration of all classes of insurance is co-operative , being conducted by co-operative hoards of working-men and employers . Such in brief is the imperial insurance of Germany , made compulsory by law upon every one working for wages of under five hundred dollars a year and over one hundred dollars ? the latter wage really sometimes found in Saxony , the most highly industrialized part of the empire . probably in the textile industry , which has become almost femininized . There are the infinite qualifications and reservations of codes of law . The German tongue in a German law becomes an intellectual exercise which makes any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws are obscure as well as complicated , and this obscurity was one of the reasons for that " open and uncompromising dislike " with which they were at first regarded by the industrial class . The German workingman always distrusts a new law . A new law means to him a new tax . To the younger and more ignorant , the new project for his amelioration presented itself only as a deduction every week from his wages , with dubious and distant prospects of return . Little trouble was taken by the government to explain the benefits of the measure , compulsion being so uppermost in German official action ; and it has been one of the important concerns of the trades-unions and working-men 's secretariates to explain the conditions of the insurance to those upon whom it bears . It is lint savorless reading and not for a summer 's day , this mass of equivocation and figures , and yet a law has the blood of men in it , and these for state insurance are as much the expression of the thoughts and visions of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon us all , as the Cologne Cathedral and the Ninth Symphony are of something that has gone before . A. great people stirs , and sighs , and speaks over the fire at evening of that which is upon the air ; and great men have worked in their libraries , for the most part in foreign lands because Germany had exiled them , and so at last this vast relief of human despair and waste is begun . We have come to believe that the world dictates to a man what he shall say , and perhaps we shall not see this better shown than in the imperial figure of the Iron Chancellor of monarchy undertaking state socialism and acknowledging this new ideal in the state ? not liberty , not that freedom which the ancients worshipped ? a conviction rather than an ideal , becoming more and more defined and commonplace , forced upon us all whether we recognize it consciously or not , that human life grows more socialized , and is coming to hang together in a structure which forces us to take account of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class " was to Bismarck certainly only a means to make an end in which the working classes were something quite aside ; and the statue in Hamburg of a working-man presenting him a wreath of grateful tribute is symbolism of somewhat sorry point . It is said in Germany that the Emperor took the plans of the great imperialist for social reform far more seriously than Bismarck intended them to be taken . There is great drama in sociology , where millions of men act out the play instead of the inevitable three ; and a race is the hero ; and the world the stage , or at least the map of a continent . The act of the German state insurance opens with a war and a falsified telegram . Lassalle flashes across it with his brilliant Berlin years , his defence of injured woman , the theft of the jewel-casket , the bitter years of struggle to organize his party , the duel . Men execrated and honored appear in it and pass away ? Marx and Engels , Liebkuecht and Bebelthe overmastering figure of Bismarck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by millions , hordes upon hordes , the German working-man , who " is not much that he should talk " or even perhaps act , but who has yet accomplished some of his own ends after his own method and fashion . The gold of the French war indemnity flowed into a land which had tasted poverty in its mouth for generations . This stream of French milliards made it delirious with joy . Every shoemaker became a prince . and " proudly bore his lance . " Germany laved herself in gold in the days of her young unity and vigor . She became modern industrially in a sudden convulsion of new life . The end came quickly enough . In the " great crack " of the 70 's thousands of factories were closed down ; crowds of workmen moved upon the cities from the small industries which had gone to the wall in the towns ; the work which they had hoped to find in the great industrial centres was not to be had . The immediate reason for the execution of the insurance laws was undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , increased by the crisis , was weighing upon them too heavily to be borne ; and secondarily , it was a new move of the government for the repression of socialism , the greatest threatening force with which the empire had to reckon within itself . The anti-socialist law had glorified and vitalized the movement with the masses , as persecution will often do ; the power of the socialist propaganda had been greatly increased by the suffering of tho working-people during the crisis . In all classes there was probably a growing social emotion which demanded some constructive measure to be placed beside the repressive law . A new policy , to increase the loyalty of the working class to the state by such measures as the socialists had themselves advocated , was introduced by imperial message in the Reichstag in 1881 . There is a humor , at which one can not choose but smile , in the stately words with which the beloved old Emperor expresses as simply as a child the mingling of necessity and emotion which , when they work together , always raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Christ as princes have for so many ages . " One must acknowledge , " the message says . " that in the whole situation of the working-man there are misfortunes that can not be combated by measures of law , but they can be ameliorated by laws which consider the condition of the laborer , and these laws must be earnestly begun . To help in a high measure those who need our help is not only the duty of humanity and Christianity with which the institutions of the state should be penetrated , but also a task of state-conserving policy ; to give to those who are the most numerous and the least cultivated the idea that the state is not only a necessary but a benevolent institution . It is the conviction of the Emperor that the healing of social evils must not be sought exclusively by suppression of social excesses , but also by positive furthering of the benefit of the working class . One must give to the Fatherland new and lasting guarantees for internal peace , and to those who need our help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thought that there may be in the law a socialistic element may not prevent us to go that way ; inasmuch as this is really so , it is nothing new , but only the idea of a modern state which has grown up out of modern culture . To find the VOL . CXIX. ? No. 719 , - 91 AMMERmeans of this enormous task is very difficult , but these are the highest tasks of a Christian people . " And so revolution becomes a matter of " state-conserving policy " and is accomplished after the unsanguinary German fashion , which does not carry the heads of weak men upon pikes , but forces the most autocratic statesman of modern times to say what it desires him to say , the almost mechanical implement of his imperial plan , and yet in some deeper way his master . The first bill for sickness was two years in passing . The socialists opposed it on the ground of insufficiency and because they thought it likely to undermine the efforts of the working class for action which they held to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manufacturers , opposed it . It was supported by the throne . The accident bill came the year after the sickness bill ( 1884 ) , and that for old age and invalidity five years later ( 1889 ) , Eismarck always speaking for them , since they were government measures . The insurance has become in less than thirty years part of the warp of German life . It affects the life of the masses like common-school education with endless meaning and issue . Twelve million people have sickness insurance ; fourteen millions are insured against invalidism and old age : nineteen million against accident . When a boy begins his apprenticeship at sixteen , he begins his insurance . Even children under age who work for wages out of school hours are required to insure for invalidism and old age . The men in labor colonies must be insured , and prisoners hired out by the state . In every factory one meets it ; in every tenement . It has been estimated that , counting with the insured their families , who are also protected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this vast imperial backing of peace . It seems the beginning of a new order , so elaborated , so scientific , but it is dreary as the Germans have done it , dreary and insentient ? the Germans would say " sad . " Perhaps any other nation could have undertaken this human adventure with more hot fervor . It seems sometimes as if all official Germany were dressed in the latest mode of social legislation and theory , but with that beneath which has no heat , as if it were a fashionable woman with vacant eyes . The whole system of the insurance is tied up with red tape in a way that even the patient workman of Germany can not hear . The administration employs an army of clerks and officials . The statistical year-book of the empire shows that only about six per cent . of the income goes into administration , but the proportion is undoubtedly much greater : some careful authorities set it at perhaps one-half . It is part of the cumbersome bureaucracy of Prussian rule . Everything is made from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Prussia . The wage scales in the remodelled sickness law of 1897 were taken from figures already twenty years old . Germany is developing very fast industrially . The average wage of a laborer was thirty cents a day twenty years ago ; it is now sixty or seventy-five cents , and the cost of living has risen correspondingly ? in reality far more . Sickness pensions are reckoned in general at one-half the wages of the class of labor under consideration , and the pension in the lowest class is thus set under the present law at fifteen cents a day ? an income upon which to live in any industrial town in modern Germany , however small , is only words , words , words . One could laugh sometimes at the involutions of this vast official comedy ; one could laugh if that were not so near which chills laughter . The acts are promptly and surely executed when a pensioner 's claim is established , but the official supposition in Germany is always that you are wrong ; you must prove that you are right ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud : a sick man may spend months completing the formalities of his claim . A young working-girl from the General Electric Company in Berlin came every day to Pension von Versen to speak German with a dejected American pupil . She was drawing a sickness pension of one dollar a week . She had developed tuberculosis the June before ; it was January before she had secured her papers , could begin to draw her pension and leave the factory . There had been no room for her in any of the sanatorium , or barracks , so she had remained at home . To prevent the insured from drawing pensions under false pretences while still at work , the sick-clubs require that pensioners must be in their rooms at certain hours each day ; a corps of visitors enforces this phase of the administration ; and so through the dark Berlin winter a tubercular girl hurried home each day , to be indoors between the hours of twelve and three . It was her own fault ; she might have had better hours . Au insurance pensioner may consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best physicians of Berlin ; but a man who is consulted by perhaps twenty such cases a day , and is paid a nominal sum for this department of his practice , sometimes twenty pfennigs ( five cents ) a ease , gives to it such attention as he can under these conditions . What does such a girl as Kathe Ziegler know of hygiene ? ? and so it all gets back to education , as the American thinks . meditating darkly on this German system of compulsion . Sick-pay is set under the present amended law at a maximum of thirty-nine weeks . Many of the clubs pay overtime voluntarily , but two months and a half is the average stay at one of the tuberculosis hospitals ; the patient must almost always come back home too soon . to such homes as tenements are . I saw a visiting-officer find a girl away from home one day during her hours . A languid child slipped out in the court and ran to tell her as we climbed the stairs . The girl went white when she saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death , and sank into a chair gasping , her eyes upon his face with that . look which makes a new streak in one 's mind . It was a moment before she could speak . The street was of the sun , she said then , and this room to her horrible . It was indeed horrible upon that fetid court . She had worked in a department store as long as she could stay . Her insurance was for twenty-six weeks ; she would not need it for half that time . the visitor told me as we went away . " Is human cunning , then , so poor a thing that it can not govern the outcome of its contrivances to the second and third degree " ? that because she wanted to go into the sunshine , out of that room , horrible to her , the very reservations of a law made for her , were now to deprive her of a quiet heart . during these last weeks ? One sees in the laws so many examples of detachthent from the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curious discount in the mind . A typical case is that of the working-girl who marries and leaves the factory . This is one of the recognized claims for restitution of pensions . A working-girl may in this case , if she has paid two hundred weekly contributions ( about four years ) . recover half her contribution for old age , though without interest . She could continue her insurance voluntarily , but only at twice her former premium , since she has now no employer and must pay the employer 's premium as well as her own . Such a course is impossible in the family of the ordinary German working-man , even though she were provident enough to recognize the wisdom of it . Ordinarily the working-girl who marries and /eaves the factory believes that she is through with it forever . She draws out the half of her fund which she can recover , and when she returns to her place at the machine , three or five or eight years later , she must begin anew , under much less favorable probabilities this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or invalid pension . These are minor defects of working which affect in each case but a single class of workers . The most manifest and constant defect of the system at large , is that of insufficiency in amount of pensions . A man can not live upon the largest of them . The minimum of fifty cents a week is in the large cities a fair SUM with which to rent a cellar where he may perish . Any one drawing either sickness or invalidity insurance can not supplement his pension by any light labor , since he holds it upon the assumption that he is unable to do any work . Sickness insurance means to the working-man of Berlin , except as it is seconded by his trades-union allowance , that he draws upon his capital if he has any , borrows money , sells his furniture , or starves . Even the old-age pension loses itsedge when one has calculated that a man must live five years after he is seventy only to recover what he has put in . Accident pensions are the only ones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his normal wages a man may go to a small town where rent and food are cheap and live in a kind of comfort . No one who sees the laws at work in Germany to-day can regard them as more than in a state of evolution . Germany has had to try out the plan ; and it is but melancholy Work to endeavor to realize an ideal . The laws are still only twenty-five years old . The chain is not even complete without the two new measures . It is true that the execution is categorical and doctrinaire . The bureaucratic administration devitalizes the project in some states . Some parts of the laws work better than others ; they work better in some countries , best in those where the people and the government are nearer together than they are in Prussia . If the pensions are so insufficient as to be only phantoms of relief , it must be remembered how great was the enterprise , how poor a country Germany when she undertook it , how delicate a compromise of conflicting prejudices and claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make brief returns , it must be recognized that a man might be invalided at thirty-five and draw his pension for fifty years . The married woman is a new factor in industry and is only beginning to be taken into consideration . It is true that the laws are the source of endless lawsuits and frictions , 16,000 eases a year before the main Berlin office in accident matters alone . But the frictions and processes are for the most part those of something that is new . A large proportion of the accident claims are in regard to modification in amount of pensions , since the law provides for a change in amount of pension in case of change in condition of patient . If there has been a large increase in cases of accidents seeking redress , it has been in the number of those seeking redress . not in the number of accidents occurring , and the increase is of small accidents , with a startling decrease of serious cases . Perhaps the laws are indeed not fundamental social reform , but only " a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regulation of a part of the poor-law system , " as Liebknecht arraigns them in such fiery torrents of hot eloquence . Perhaps the issue of such paternalism is questionable ? imperial compulsion upon the working class to provide for the chances of working-class life , help which makes such provision possible to it , and imperial assurance of benefit . It is all debatable , unfinished , unconfirmed . Yet flat figures show how the measures have already acted upon human life in their brief beginning . They show the decrease in the death rate and number of suicides ; in the number of orphans dependent on the state ; the falling off of emigration ; how savings-bank deposits have tripled since the laws have been in force , and the number of persons in receipt of poor relief actually diminished in one city since 1892 , though the population is half as large again , as Ashley explains in his Progress of the German Working Classes in the Last Quarter of a Century . It is significant that the attitude everywhere in Germany now is favorable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old-age and invalidity bill , which passed the Reichstag originally with a majority of only twenty votes , had almost unanimous support upon its revision ten years later .
