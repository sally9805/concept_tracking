" Justice Dayton then set the examine- , tem for 2 o'clock . At that hour Mr. Jerome and Mr. Shearn , the assistants In the case , and theenewspaper men took possession of an empty courtroom .

Mr. Jerome said that he did not know the names of more than two or three of those who contributed , because he was campaigning and did not stop to inquire .

He had never asked hint concerning either the contribution. ; or the expenses of the campaign . having perfect confidence in him . Asked if he would furnish Mr. Shearn with a copy of the list , he said emphatically that he would not unless directed to do so by the court . " Because . " said Mr. Jerome , " your client ( Hearst is one of the malicious and mendacious persons I have referred to . " He considered it a breach of promise . There were instances where it might work hardship on the contributors . Ho told of one man who kept a perfectly respectable hotel , and Is a member of Tammany Hall . " He sent me $23 , which I accepted . If that man 's name was published and I failed of election . It would be made very hard for him to do business without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Shearn said that he would apply for an order of court directing Mr. Jerome to produce the list . lie then showed that air . Jerome had received a contribution of ratite ) from Samuel Untermyer . " This was the largest single contribution accepted , " said Mr. Jerome .

Untermyer had appeared for Hyde , but that he had been informed by De Lancey Nicoll that Mr. Hyde had retained him to appear for him in any criminal proceedings , Besides , Mr. Untermyer was Mr. Jerome 's warm personal friend . " Another man , " said Mr. Jerome , a financier , who had never given a penny to politics , contributed $1,000 to my fund . I do not think it would be proper to ells - close his name , It might cause him a great deal of embarrassment . " " Did you receive any other contribution as large as Mr. Untermyer 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills to me . " " Is that Morse , the ice man ? " " Yes ; but I returned the money . Not because of any reflectron on Mr. Morse In my mind , but because ho was , I expected . to be a very necessary witness in the Hummel case . I turned the money over to Mr. Rand , and he returned it to him . " " Did Mr. Lewis L. Delafield contribute to your campaign ? " " I do n't know . I sincerely hope he did . as we have been social friends for many years . " You were aware he was counsel for George W : Perkins , who had testified to the $43,000 contribution of the New York Life to , the Republican National campaign fund ?

" The case was taken to the Appellate Division , where it was decided against me , " he , said . " Greatly to your satisfaction , " commented Mr. Shearn . " No , " responded the District Attorney . " For I had always believed that a crime had been committed . " Mr. Jerome then rapped 80mo editors . " Public opinion , " he said , " had been Inflamed by newspaper lawyers . I do not mean , " and the District Attorney laughed , " lawyers who work for the newspapers , but the ' lawyers ' in the editorial rooms . I saw that there was a most eager desire ' on the part of the newspapers and the public that somebody should be put In jail , especially in connection with the insurance disclosures . " Mr. Shearn then examined Mr. Jerome as to his proceeding in all of the insurance cases , and that of the shipbuilding trust . In this connection Mr. Shearn asked him if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of the trust . I was much engaged In trying to put a certain psalm singer in jail , " was the answer . Did you , at the conclusion of your Investigation , state that you were convinced that a. crime had been committed ; but that you , had no means of putting the big fellows in jail ? " " I do not remember , the exact language . " The examination will go on to-day .
