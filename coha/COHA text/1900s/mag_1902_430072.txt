 | President of the Chamber of Commerce , Durham , North Carolina We may assume that the negro is a human being ; that he loves , hates , can be educated and developed . Made of much coarser clay than the Caucasian , he is nevertheless fashioned in the image of God . Acting on this assumption , the Southern white people have , in the main , for well nigh forty years , taxed themselves to build negro schoolhouses , negro hospitals , and negro orphanages , and to provide for negro education . But a reaction against a continuance of such taxation has undoubtedly set in . It is now becoming popular to teach that when you educate a negro you spoil a good farm hand . In fine , the average Southern negro has lost to a certain extent his Southern white friend . Why this change of feeling towards the negro ? It is not political , for the negro has ceased to take an interest in politics . It can not be the fear of race blending or of negro domination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negro race is not able to stand up against the whites in any contest . It is found in the fact that the modern negro by his idleness and worthlessness , as a laborer , has rendered the average Southern farm unfit to live upon , and has endangered the industrial basis of the average Southern home . Whether as cook or man servant , hostler or farm hand , generally speaking , he is unreliable , uncertain , false to his contract , careless , reckless , and wasteful . And he is all this not for the reason that he is incapable of better things , for he is thoroughly efficient , when it suits his purpose to be ; for example , when he serves as Pulman porter or butler for the rich or when he works in squads or in factories . The real reason is that he thinks idleness , vice , and impudence stand for manhood and freedom . Just at this point is the great and increasing friction between the races . Just at this point the pocket book of the white man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so it happens that this grotesque , unnatural , thoughtless , and superstitious being , the negro , is talked about and knocked around by  | the Southern white man , and shunned and hated by the Southern white woman . Even in the best ordered Southern family the housewife may go to her kitchen any day expecting to find no cook and oftentimes she is not disappointed . Kind treatment , comfortable homes , increase of wages , things which ought to win the affections and hold the services play but an insignificant part in the domestic economy of a household whose domestic service is in the hands of a colored servant . The negro is restless and nomadic . Without excuse he quits his employer 's farm when it is most grassy . An excursion , a circus , or a big meeting is to him of vaster importance than the acquisition of property . We are not now considering whether the Southern white man should or could be his own laborer and his own domestic . To a great extent he must be such . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black man , and how such inefficiency keeps race strife alive . No one will deny that many farms are uncultivated and deserted and that people are leaving the country for the town because of lack of labor , and that when they reach city or town , there too life is tense for the lack of efficient domestic service . Southern hospitality is becoming but a memory . The house-wife is nervous and overwrought , made so by the strain of a thousand cares thrust upon her by bad domestic service . The arrival of guests usually means the departure of her cook ! The Southern white woman 's hate and loathing of the new negro is unspeakable . " Bridget " or " Lucy , " the old-time cook and maid , whom mother or grandmother never ceased to praise , is now but a myth , while the person who has taken her place seems to have been made by a journeyman carpenter . When a woman hates , it is her whole existence . Elisha withstood storms and war , but incontinently fled before an enraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Carthage to give the hair of their heads wherewith to string bows to carry death to their enemy . It is much the same way with the Southern woman . She cheerfully gave her jewels to the Confederacy . She knit socks , and sewed garments , and supervised the work of the plantation , and despised the " stay-athome , " creating , the while , a sentiment which sustained the boys at the front . Since the war she has made the South what it is . The Southern woman has rendered impossible the growth of any  | political party built upon negro votes . The inefficiency of the negro makes the burden of the Southern white woman a thousand fold heavier than that of her husband . The servant question is the nightmare of the Southern home , and you will never even begin to settle the negro problem until you settle this question of farm labor and domestic service . For behind this question is the white woman , fearless , uncompromising , and bearing a great grievance . That the situation is serious , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than at any time since 1865 few will deny . Unless a marked change for the better soon occurs , not only will there be increased violence towards the average negro , but upon hatred of him will grow up a political party that will sweep away his schools , his orphan homes , and his hospitals , and will expatriate him or make a chattel of him . Crumpacker legislation and the like will but add to the acuteness of race feeling . Leg-es sine moribus have ever been , and ever will be , vain , most vain . The question arises , therefore , How can these unkindly racial relations be changed ? The reply is let the negro do his duty as a laborer and a domestic and the negro problem is solved . The white man will then stand by him in all his troubles , and the white woman will have no cause further to dislike him . Even now the best Southern white man or woman would lay down a life in defense of a faithful colored friend . But such colored friends are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President of the United States . If Mr. Roosevelt will issue an open letter , or better , his proclamation , if possible under the great seal of the country , setting forth the substance of these thoughts , and if such proclamation be framed and hung in negro houses and read by negro teachers and preachers from school platforms and pulpits , an instant change will be felt throughout the entire South . A sentiment will be created among the negroes that it is proper and manly to do one 's duty , and that it is highly improper to break one 's contract and be idle and impudent . Then indeed will the black man be secure in his rights , for behind every black man will be one white man , and when such is the case they are not easily coerced . Now , there are those who believe that when the negro becomes educated and wealthy he will command such respect as to win  | social place among his white neighbors , and there are others who think that the negro is a beast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are not both in error ? And if both are in error , where is the safe way between these extremes ? What is the limit of the advancement of the negro in wealth , in education , in morals ? It has no limit . If he will now and at once but heed the voice of friendship and proceed to do his duty in that state of life in which it has pleased God to call him , he will have friends by the million , and the extremists dare not touch a hair of his head . The negro can do his duty and he will do it . I voice but the true sentiment of the South when I wish for the negro all things good and useful , short of social equality . May wealth and virtue and contentment be his forever .
