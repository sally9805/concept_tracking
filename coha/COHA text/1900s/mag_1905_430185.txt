 |p629  INTERESTING as Dalny may be for a day or two , it becomes very tiresome when one is longing to get to the front and is officially held up , apparently without reason , for nearly a week . Day after day and night after night we could hear the booming of big guns in the direction of Port Arthur ; but no word came from General Nogi , and without his permission we could not leave the dirty Russian office on the Kiefski Prospect , where it was always cheerless and cold , where we had to sleep on narrow , lumpy sofas , and where ? to adopt Toku 's quaint English ? " Russian insects sometime come very fierce . " Mr. Curtis suggested to Lieutenant Oata that it might be possible to frighten away these ferocious insects by having our two " boys " sit up during the first part of the night and play Japanese tea-house melodies on the Russian piano . But the Lieutenant , who had a higher opinion of Japanese music than I had , declared that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? would attract them , in fact , from all the other houses in the block ? so that suggestion was vetoed . As we could not expect the Japanese authorities to feed us while we waited indefinitely for orders , we set out on the morning after our arrival in search of a place where we could get our meals . As it was still early , hundreds of Manchurian teamsters were seeking employmerit for the day , and the Kiefski Prospect for a quarter of a mile was an almost solid mass of horses , mules , donkeys , and steers , harnessed , by means of rope traces , to all sorts of dusty wagons and carts . On the sidewalk there was a dense throng of at least five hundred 1 Copyright , 1905 , the Outlook Company , New York . deeply sunburned men in gray skull-caps and wadded clothing of Nankin blue who crowded in groups around Chinese transportation contractors and waved in air long-handled whips decorated with square red flags as they shouted lustily for recognition and engagement . At first sight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carts and under the heads of horses and mules we finally got out of the congested area , and made our way through the commercial quarter to a Chinese restaurant known to many of the war correspondents as the " Sing Song Chow House . " One might have supposed from its name that it was an Oriental cafe chantant ; but it proved to be a quiet , unpretentious place , which was half grocery and half restaurant , and which prepared and served meals in any desired style , from Franco-Russo-Manchurian to plain Japanese . The walls of the restaurant proper were decorated with long inscribed strips of red firecracker paper ; colored Chinese lanterns hung overhead ; and as soon as you seated yourself at one of the oilclothcovered tables a servant surrounded you and shut you in with folding screens on which Chinese tigers and imperial dragons were heavily embroidered in gold . The cook always came himself for orders , but you seldom got what you asked for . To your inquiry whether you could have this or that , he always responded , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing was never caught . He actually borrowed one morning from a neighboring meat-market a fine-looking leg of lamb and brought it in for our inspection ; but although we approved it enthusiastically and ordered him to roast it for dinner , he calmly returned it to the meat-market and we saw it no  |p630  more . In its place we had a Chinese stew , whose component parts it was safer to guess at than analyze . However , we managed to get enough that was eatable to make good the waste of tissue caused by long walks in cold winds , and we boarded with Mr. Sing Chong four days . As a curiosity , I append a literal copy of the bill that was furnished to us , in English , for a single day 's meals : The " Battle " of " Large Beer " and the " 3 pieces of Man " were perfectly intelligible ; but the word " Basts " in the first three lines puzzled us . If we had brought dogs or horses to the restaurant , I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the food for the latter was included in the sum to be paid by the " 3 pieces of Man . " Inasmuch , however , as we had no domestic animals , I finally concluded that " Basts " must be a pidgin-English transliteration of the Chinese word for " hungry , " and that it was inserted as a sort of apologetic justification of the exorbitant rates charged . Three pieces of Man who always came in ravenously hungry must expect to be basted in the bill , and the mysterious letters " S. &; C. " in red ink at the bottom of the page were probably intended to characterize the food as " Satisfying &; Cheap " at twelve yen per day . We did not find it so , but the accessories ? the golden-dragon screens , the happy-fortune texts on long strips of crimson paper which were pasted against the walls , and the cheerful " Can catchee " of the optimistic cook when we asked for something that did not happen to be in stock ? were worth at least four yen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took an appreciative and sympathetic interest in the methods , the decorations , and the quaint bills of " Sing Song Chow Houses " and Manchurian " Hotel Shops . " If they had only basted their meats more and their customers less , I should remember them with joy ! One of the most interesting places in Dalny , at the time of our visit , was " Railway Station No. 2 , " where we used to go every afternoon to see the combined train come in with sick and wounded from Port Arthur and Liaoyang . I was not morbidly desirous of looking at mangled and tortured men ; but , in the first place , I wanted to see how they were treated and cared for by the corps of Red Cross doctors and nurses , and , in the second place , I was curious to know . as a matter of interest in connection with the national character , whether the extraordinary fortitude of Japanese soldiers could be shaken or broken down by twenty hours of suffering in jolting flat cars , where they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the penetrating chill of the long Manchurian night . I fully satisfied myself with regard to both points . Sick and wounded men from the front are brought back to Dalny as carefully as they can be brought in the cars that the Japanese have at their disposa .. Those whose cases are most serious are put into closed box cars and are furnished . when necessary , not only with extra blankets but with mattresses . The Jightly wounded and convalescent sick have to ride in open flat cars ; but they are seldom crowded , and by wrapping themselves up in their blankets and overcoats they manage , somehow , to get through the night . That both classes suffer intensely there can be no question ; but they do not show it . In a whole train-load you may , possibly , see one man , with a broken shoulder or a smashed thigh , who contracts his brow in a faint scowl as a clumsy stretcher-bearer shakes or jolts him in taking him out of the train ; but four hundred and ninety-nine out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such fortitude , you may say , is the cultivated stoicism of many centuries , and perhaps it is ; but , after all , it is a fine thing to see thousands of men who are " bigger than anything that can happen to them , " and who endure  |p631  page deleted  |p632  by a corps of Red Cross surgeons , and furnished , when necessary , with hot food from a neighboring kitchen . Every man brought with him , from the field hospital at the front where he had been treated , not only his identification tag , but a complete medical record of his case . The surgeons in the sheds read these papers , examined the patients , decided what should be done with them , made additional notes on the records , and , after giving them time for rest and refreshment , sent them to steamers lying at the piers , or to one of the forwarding hospitals in the city . The slightly wounded and convalescent sick went directly to Japan , while the more serious cases were held in Dalny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and system , and in half or three-quarters of an hour after the arrival of the train the sheds were empty and all the men were either in hospital or on their way home . In order to get room for new arrivals from Port Arthur and the north , the resident surgeons made a partial clearance of the Dalny hospitals every day , by sending to Japan all patients who were able to stand the sea voyage . Half a dozen Red Cross steamers were constantly going back and forth , and every one of the larger transports , such as the Tosa-maru and the Aki-maru , had accommodations for wounded , and carried a regular staff of thirty surgeons and nurses . When , therefore , a man reached Dalny , he had no more severe hardships to anticipate . It is unnecessary , perhaps , to compare the treatment of Japanese sick and wounded with that received by our soldiers in eastern Cuba and on some of the transports that brought them home ; but we may profitably think about the matter and take notes . The bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalny is bad , and causes unnecessary suffering ; but it must not be forgotten that the Japanese had to change the gauge of two hundred and fifty miles of road , and import all the rolling stock for it from Japan , while at the same time they were carrying on a great war and sending to the front provisions and ammunition for an army of two or three hundred thousand men . It was virtually impossible , in such circumstances , to equip- the railway with hospital trains , and they had to do the best they could with freight cars . If fighting continues in the north through the winter , the transportation of wounded from Liaoyang to Dalny in open flat cars may become impracticable , on account of the severity of the Manchurian climate ; but the soldiers at the front have been abundantly supplied with warm clothing , and by the time the cold becomes intense the Japanese will probably have brought over closed cars enough to make up two or three ambulance trains , warmed by hibachis or sheet-iron stoves . Meanwhile their facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate , and although they have sometimes had to handle as many as twelve thousand disabled men in a week , they have never been overwhelmed . At a single bandaging station I have known them to pick up and give first aid to two thousand wounded men in eight hours . On the 23d of October we finally received permission to proceed to Port Arthur , and , loading our baggage into a Chinese cart , we bade good-by to the dust , torn lace curtains , lumpy sofas , and " fierce " insects of the Russian office on the Kiefski Prospect , and walked down to the railway station in the residential quarter of the town . The degree of comfort with which one can go by rail from Dalny to the head quarters of the besieging army before Port Arthur depends , first , upon the nature of the train that one happens to catch , and , second , upon the state of the weather . The Japanese did not find in Dalny locomotives and rolling stock enough to equip the southern division of the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cars from the narrower railways of Japan , and then change the gauge of the Manchurian line to fit them . As flat cars were more easily transported and more generally useful than either box cars or coaches , few of the latter were imported , and passengers bound for Port Arthur or Liaoyang had to go as live stock , and to get along as best they could without seats and without any protection whatever from wind or weather . Once a day the station-master at Dalny was supposed to make up a train de luxe , by adding to the long line of loaded flat cars a single third-class coach ; but one could never find out whether this particular train would leave Dalny in the morning , at noon , or at night , and the chances were at least three to one that a traveler going either south to Port Arthur or north to Liaoyang would have to sit for hours on a pile of lumber , a box of hard bread , or a big eleven-inch shell , with a cold wind whistling about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling his eyes with cinders and his lungs with sulphurous gas . When we went to the station , or rather to the place where the station had been , on the morning of Sunday , October 23 , we found that the first train to Port Arthur that day consisted of six flat cars , piled to a height of twelve or fourteen feet with lumber . " We never can get our baggage up on those loads , " I said to Curtis , in dismay , as I glanced at the perpendicular sides of the heavily loaded cars . " We can hardly climb up ourselves without a ladder . " There were a number of empty flat cars on a neighboring siding , and we tried to persuade the station-master to attach one of these to the train for our use ; but he said that on account of the scarcity of rolling stock he could not send out a car without a load , and that we must either get our baggage up on the lumber in some way or wait for a later train . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for permission to go to the front , we were determined not to submit to further delay , even if we had to abandon our heavy baggage altogether ; so , returning to the platform , we ordered our " boys to throw up the lighter packages , and then climbed up ourselves between two of the cars , where the projecting ends of the boards afforded a sort of foothold . There happened , fortunately , to be forty or fifty Japanese soldiers on the train . and as soon as they noticed our embarrassment they came , with characteristic good nature , to our relief , and , swarming over the sides of the cars , helped our servants to hoist the heavy trunks and cases of provisions up the precipices of  |p633  lumber and stow them away on top . The locomotive engineer , who had been watching with benevolent interest our efforts to get aboard , then blew a short blast on his whistle , and , with much jerking and clanking of couplings , we slowly got under way , ran out of the deep Culebra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water of the upper bay , and finally lost sight of Dalny as we rounded the base of a stony hill and entered the shallow , treeless valley which extends northward to the junction of the Talienwan branch with the main line at Sanshilipu . The interior of the Liaotung Peninsula is much more thickly settled and thoroughly cultivated than the barrenness of the seacoast would lead one to expect . Every mile or two we passed long , substantial Manchurian farm-houses with stone walls and A-shaped roofs of tiles or thatch ; and in the stone-walled courtyards that surrounded them there were many signs of agricultural thrift and prosperity in the shape of well-fed domestic animals , carts , stables , haystacks , and big piles of millet or shelled corn drying in the sunshine on square mats of losely woven reeds . The year 's crops had all been harvested , but the denuded fields were dotted with men and women in garments of faded blue , who were busily engaged in plowing , or in pulling up cornstalk roots for winter fuel . Long lines of native carts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dust on the wagon road to Port Arthur ; and here and there on the outskirts of a village one might see a blindfolded donkey grinding corn by pulling around in a circle a horizontal bar attached to the upper of two millstones , or a big gray mule dragging a corrugated stone roller over a layer of millet stalks on a circular threshing-floor of hardbeaten earth . All the agricultural methods of the country seemed to be primitive and rude ; but the whole population was at work , and had something tangible to show , moreover , for its labor . In the character of its inhabitants , if not in the fertility of its soil , Manchuria impressed me more favorably than Korea . As one goes from Dalny to Port Arthur by rail , one wonders that the Russians were ever driven from the splendid defensive positions that the country everywhere affords . The whole interior of the peninsula is a mass of steep , barren hills , which rise , in places , to heights of a thousand and twelve hundred feet , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiles . When Port Arthur was isolated by the cutting of the railroad north of Kinchow , General Stoessel had under his command an army of at least thirty thousand men , possibly forty thousand , besides the bluejackets of the Port Arthur fleet . After leaving five thousand men to garrison the seacoast forts , he still had twenty-five or thirty thousand men available for field operations ; and with such a force , in a country that is full of natural strongholds of the most formidable kind , he ought to have held back the Japanese advance twice as long as he did . Between the Kinchow Isthmus and Port Arthur there are at least half a dozen hills and ranges , such as Antzushan , Antzuling , Kensan , and the Langshan range , which might have been made as strong as Nanshan , or 203-Meter Hill ; and if the Russians had defended these positions with half the courage and obstinacy that they afterward displayed in the defense of the forts and intrenched hills of Port Arthur itself , they might have inflicted immense losses upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter to begin siege operations before the end of October or November . Instead , however , of throwing their whole available force to the front , so as to intrench strongly and hold securely the most important strategic hills on the lines of the Japanese advance , they allowed themselves to be greatly outnumbered at almost every point of attack , failed to intrench properly the naturally strong positions that the country afforded , and offered comparatively feeble resistance at places where they should have fought as fiercely as at Nanshan . The only heights that they fortified adequately and defended with anything like vigor were Shuangtaikou , Antzuling , and Tapaishan ; and even from these they allowed themselves to be driven with a loss of only a thousand men , although ,  |p634  according to the official Japanese report , they had in action a total force of twenty or thirty thousand , with sixty field guns . The reasons for the ineffective resistance of the Russians to the Japanese advance on Port Arthur were probably three . In the first place , no comprehensive scheme of defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made to select and fortify strategic positions southwest of the Kinchow Isthmus . When , therefore , the Japanese stormed Nanshan Hill and took possession of Dalny , the Russians had to decide upon a plan of campaign hurriedly , and in a time of excitement and confusion . In the second place , General Stoessel probably had no well-organized system of transportation , and he doubtless found it very difficult to feed large bodies of troops and keep them supplied with ammunition on wild , barren mountains at a distance from the railroad . Finally , the Japanese , who are indefatigable marchers and hillclimbers , and who have an admirable transportation system , advanced southward in three or four columns and by as many different routes , so that while they were attacking in one place they were threatening to outflank ? and often were actually outflanking ? in another . General Stoessel , who , very likely , had never studied the topography of the peninsula in connection with a possible plan of invasion by three or four routes simultaneously , found it difficult to foresee the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear that if his troops continued to hold them against one hostile column their retreat to Port Arthur might be cut off by another . The extreme right and left wings of General Nogi 's army were twelve or fifteen miles apart ; its intercommunicating columns were pushing southward along the lines of least resistance , and on one flank or the other they were constantly getting around or behind Russian positions that might have been held against direct frontal attacks for weeks . It is altogether probable , moreover , that General Stoessel placed great reliance upon the chain of powerful forts which surrounded the city , and that he thought it unwise to waste men in the desperate defense of distant hills and passes when the nearer line of intrenchment was so certainly impregnable . In any event ? for these reasons or for others ? the Russians did retreat steadi:r through the peninsula and did abandon a whole series of positions of extraordinary strength which the Japanese would have held for five or six months against an army double or treble their . own in size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than would have been possible had the Rusians shown greater ability in the management of the preliminary campaign and more vigor in the defense of the outlying hills . It might have made a great difference in the final outcome if the Japanese had lost fifteen or twenty thousand men before they got within shelling distance of the big permanent forts , and if they had had to begin siege operations in November instead of August . The Russians are doubtless entitled to great credit for their stubborn defense of Port Arthur ; but in allowing the Japanese to construct without interference a ten-mile boom from Terminal Head to the outer Elliott Islands , in permitting them to land without opposition in Yentoa Bay , in neglecting to prepare a second line of defense at Nankuanling on the Kinchow Isthmus , and in failing adequately to intrench and hold the extremely strong positions between that isthmus and Port Arthur , they showed lack of foresight , lack of energy . and lack of strategic skill . Between Sanshilipu Junction and the front we could see from the train many long lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sand-bag batteries ; but I did not notice anything that could properly be called a fort or even a semi-permanent intrenchment . The defensive works , such as they were . had evidently been constructed after the Russian defeat at Nanshan Hill . Although the distance from Dalny to Port Arthur by rail is only forty miles . the journey , owing to stops , waits , and switching , occupies three or four hours . and it was the middle of the afternoon when we finally climbed down from our flat cars and stretched our cramped legs in front of the small Chinese village  |p635  where General Nogi had his headquarters . It was a typical Manchurian hamlet of perhaps ten or fifteen stone houses surrounded by walled courtyards and shaded by a few clumps of willow and poplar trees from which the last withered leaves of autumn were just falling . A feeble brook ran past it in rather a deep , barren gulch , and between this brook and the houses ten or fifteen saddlehorses , tied to posts under the trees , were pawing the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , in the courtyards , stood a few large conical tents of white canvas , and a little farther up the right bank of the s stream , just across a dusty road , there was a scattered collection of rough board shanties and matting shacks , which were banked up with earth and sheltered by thick outer walls of standing cornstalks to protect them from the cold northerly winds . Chinese children were playing in one of the two streets that made up the native village ; chickens and ducks were wandering about among the shanties and shacks of the Japanese quarter ; a long train of donkeys had i just come in loaded with bundles of firewood ; and down in the gulch , beside the stream , two or three soldiers were washing clothes , while another was superintending the boiling of water in two big iron kettles mounted on a sort of wheeled soup-kitchen that had been captured from the Russians . Of the pomp and circumstance of war there was hardly a suggestion . A solitary sentry stood at the courtyard gate of General Nogi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets ; no mounted orderlies were spurring in or out with reports or orders ; not a flag was flying in the whole settlement ; ; and it was almost impossible to believe that this wretched Chinese village , with its annex of frontier shacks and shanties , was the headquarters of the Third Imperial Army , and that from it were being directed the movements of sixty thousand men on a fighting-line more than ten miles in length . Turning in at the open gate of a walled courtyard partly shaded by trees , we entered a long , one-story Manchurian Buse of the ordinary type , and in a small , scantily furnished room , decorated with strips of red paper and mural paintings of Chinese Buddhas or saints , we found General Ijichi , chief of staff of the Third Army . He received us cordially , and began at once to apologize for the delay to which we had been subjected at Dalny . Our arrival there , he said , had been reported to him , but as he had received no information with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we were nor what disposition to make of us . He had therefore detained us until he could get instructions from the General Staff in Tokyo . It occurred to me , while this explanation was being interpreted , that it would have been much simpler to send for us at once , and give us an opportunity to present personally our letters of introduction and passes , especially as General Ijichi knew that we were accompanied by a Japanese officer ; but I made no comment . The General then inquired what our wishes and plans were , and suggested that as life at the front would be full of discomforts and hardships , we might find it better to go back to Dalny and live there , coming to the front occasionally , by train , to witness general assaults , of which we should receive due notification . To this we strenuously objected . Residence in Dalny was quite as uncomfortable as life at the front could be ; and to watch a siege at a distance of forty miles was obviously impracticable . After some further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no tent , and mine was not large enough to hold us all , with our servants , quarters should be provided for us in one half of a Chinese house in the neighboring village of Liukiatun . This was three-quarters of a mile north of staff headquarters , and at least three or four miles from the advanced Japanese " positions ; but we were not then aware of that fact , and were glad finally to get settled anywhere at the front . General Ijichi then informed us that we should not be permitted to send out letters or telegrams for publication , that we should be required to submit even our private letters to censorship , and that we must agree to remain at Port Arthur until the end of the siege . To these conditions we assented . We were  |p636  page deleted
