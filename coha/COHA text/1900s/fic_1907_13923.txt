At MRS . WARDER 'S . An extremely attractive room , in the best of taste , gray walls with dull soft green moldings , old French chintz curtains , furniture painted to match the walls and covered with the same chintz . Some old colored engravings are on the mantel-shelf and a couple of eighteenth-century French portraits on the wall . On the left is a mantel , and near it a large writing table against the back of a low sofa which faces the audience ; on the table a telephone ; an arm-chair and a small table on the left ; a baby grand piano in the upper left corner of the room . Some consols and tables in the room ; four windows at the back , through which one sees the park . Doors , right and left ; books , photographs , flowers , etc. , on the tables and consols . A smart , good-looking man-servant , JENKS , shows in MRS . LINDON and LAURA FRASER . The former is a handsome , nervous , overstrung woman of about thirty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , a matter-of-fact , rather commonplace type of good humor  --  wholesomeness united to a kind sense of humor . MRS . LINDON is the sort of woman warranted to put any one on edge in the course of a few hours ' consecutive association , while friction with MISS FRASER is equally certain to smooth down the raw edges . EVE coming in to a chair near the center with quick determination.You have no idea when Mrs. Warder will be in ? p. 3 SERVANT No , madam . EVE She was lunching out ? SERVANT Yes , madam . FRASER with a movement to go.Come ! She may be playing bridge and not come home for hours . EVE firm , though irritable.I will wait till half past five . To SERVANT . If Mrs. Warder comes in before that , we will be here . Nervously picks up check-book from the writing-table , looks at it but not in it , and puts it down . SERVANT Very good , madam . Goes out left . FRASER Goes to EVE . My dear , you must control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant 's curiosity , could easily see you are excited . EVE Yes , but think ! She 's been meeting Fred probably every day for the last two months , although she knew I had left his house , and always pretended to me she never saw him ! Sitting beside the writing-table . FRASER sitting left. You should n't have come here at once . You should have waited till you had time to think over your information and calm yourself a little . p. 4 EVE I could n't wait ! Becky ! One of my oldest friends ! One of my bridesmaids ! FRASER What ! EVE No , she was n't , but she might have been ; she was my next choice if any one had backed out . FRASER Probably Fred 's appealing to her sympathy ,  --  you know your own husband ! EVE with a disagreeable half-laugh.Yes , I know him better than she does ! What I do n't like is her secrecy about it after I 'd made her the confidante of my trouble ! FRASER I thought I was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forget that I have gone to Becky in hysterics and begged her to make it up for me with Fred . FRASER Were you perfectly frank with her ? EVE Perfectly ! I told her the truth , and more too ! I told her I loved Fred in spite of his faults  --  Good Heavens ! if a woman had to find a faultless man to love !  --  I 've asked her advice . Rising nervously and going to the sofa . FRASER You have n't taken it ! EVE That does n't make any difference ! Who ever does ? Sitting on the sofa . She owed me her loyalty instead of flirting with Fred behind my back . She opens the cigar box on the writing-table behind her and then bangs it shut. p. 5 FRASER Perhaps she 's really trying to make peace between you in her own way ! EVE Does it look like it ? Actually telling me yesterday she would n't trust herself in his presence for fear she 'd lose her control and tell him what she thought of him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet him this afternoon  --  in the Eden Muse , if you please ! FRASER with comic disgust.Oh ! Horrors ! EVE Yes , in the chamber of them ! If that is n't compromising ! FRASER Eve ! EVE And Tom Warder so nice ! Everybody likes him ! Picks up stamp box and bangs it down . FRASER Including Becky . That 's the point . Becky loves her own husband . What does she want of yours ? EVE She loved Tom Warder when she married him , but that was in 1903 ! Besides , Becky always liked having men fond of her whether she cared for them or not . FRASER Nonsense ! EVE She 's what the French call an " allumeuse "  --  leads them on till they lose their heads , then she gets frightened and feels insulted ! p. 6 FRASER But you claim she does care for Fred ! EVE My dear , a magnetic man like Fred has a way of winding himself around a woman and keeping himself wound as long as he wishes ! even when she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give anything to throw him off for good , but I ca n't stop being in love with him ! FRASER who has moved over to the chair beside the sofa , pats EVE 'S hand.Poor old Eve ! Well , when she comes , what are you going to do ? EVE Give her one more chance to tell me the truth ! I 'll ask her outright when she saw Fred last . FRASER But if she keeps on with her " bluff " of not seeing him , you ca n't tell her she lies without making a horrid scene , and what good would that do ? EVE Exactly ! She 'd never acknowledge she was lying but just go on ! I may appeal to Tom Warder himself ! Rises and goes to mantel , looking at the fly-leaves of two books on a table which she passes . FRASER No ! EVE Why not ? We 've been friends since babies . FRASER You would n't ! EVE I do n't accuse Becky of anything dreadful ! Besides , it will be for his good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred , and I 'll wager anything he 'll be as eager as I to stop any excess of friendship with him . Goes up to the window . Sh ! here she is ! and a man with her ! p. 7 FRASER Rises , excited , and joins her . Who ? EVE going to the other window.I ca n't see . FRASER joining her at the second window.Suppose it should be  --  EVE Exactly ! If she hears I 'm here , she 'll never let him in . She starts with a new idea and goes to the door right . The window in that hall juts out ; perhaps we can see the front door from there . Come quickly ! Tries to pull LAURA out right . FRASER I do n't approve of what you 're doing at all . EVE Oh , come ! They go out and close the door behind them . The SERVANT shows in BECKY and LINDON , left . BECKY is a pretty , charming , volatile young woman , sprightly , vivacious , lovable . She is dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dapper , rather good-looking , though not particularly strong in character , and full of a certain personal charm . He also wears very fashionable clothes . He is a man whose chief aim in life is to amuse himself . SERVANT Mrs. Lindon and Miss Fraser were waiting to see you , madam ; they must have gone . p. 8 BECKY with a humorous raising of the eyebrows and a look to LINDON.Oh !  --  I 'm so sorry ! The SERVANT goes out . FRED Gee ! what a narrow escape . FRASER off stage right , pleading loudly.Eve ! Eve ! ! Come ! ! ! EVE off stage right , loudly.I will not . I will run my own affairs my own way . BECKY who has heard this , with an amused , mischievous expression.They are there ! Do you suppose they saw you ? They lower their voices slightly . FRED Well ,  --  Eve can see through most things , but not through the walls ! Good-bye . He starts to hurry out , but BECKY stops him . BECKY You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me to-day for  --  to talk about Eve . This estrangement has gone on long enough . I 've come to the conclusion you 're as much to blame as she is  --  or more . FRED I like that from you ! BECKY I mean it , and if she wants you back , you 've got to go . p. 9 FRED Well , let me get a cocktail first . BECKY I 'm serious . FRED So 'll I be if Eve comes in and catches me . Going . BECKY going with him. I 'll let you out  --  but I expect you here again in half an hour . Do you understand ? They go out left . Off stage . You 're to come back at six . FRED off stage , at a distance.All right . EVE comes in excitedly from the right . EVE I think it is Fred ! Watch from the window ! I 'll stay here in case Becky comes in . She comes to the writing-table . I 'd like to scratch her eyes out ! LAURA comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Fred . EVE Gives a tigerish , half-controlled , kushed cry of rage . The wretched little beast ! BECKY comes in with a start of surprise . She beams . BECKY My dears ! What a pleasant surprise ! Why did n't Jenks tell me ? Where in the world did you drop from ? Laura , darling ! She kisses LAURA , who is very unresponsive , having pressed MRS . LINDON 'S hand as she passed her. p. 10 EVE We heard you come in ,  --  we thought with some one ,  --  and as I 'm rather upset , we went in there till you should be alone . If you are busy , do n't let us interrupt . BECKY shows that she is relieved when she hears they do n't know FRED was there . BECKY Oh , dear , no , I 'm not busy . I came home alone ,  --  you must have heard me talking with the servant . I 've been playing bridge since luncheon . BECKY and LAURA sit on the sofa . EVE Where ? BECKY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVE exchange glances . EVE Why ! I saw her lunching at Sherry 's . BECKY quickly , after only a second 's hesitation.Yes , she could n't play to-day , but it was her turn at her house , so we went all the same  --  and  --  er  --  er  --  Belle Prescott took her place . Another surreptitious look passes between LAURA and MRS . LINDON . FRASER Did you win ? BECKY Yes , a hundred and fifty ! FRASER A hundred and fifty ? Good ! p. 11 EVE who has seated herself in the chair beside the sofa.Becky , Laura knows all my troubles ; she 's the bosom I weep them out on . BECKY Oh , come , I 've gathered a few dewy diamonds off my laces ! Well , how is Fred behaving ? Has he shown any sign yet ? EVE Not one . I thought perhaps you 'd have some news . BECKY looking away. I ? How should I have ? Leans over and smooths her skirt . MRS . LINDON exchanges a look with LAURA . EVE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , and Fred would make an advance . BECKY And so he will , I 'm sure ! unless you do what you threatened . To LAURA . I tell Eve if she starts a suit for separation or does anything of that sort publicly , Fred may be furious and accept the situation , no matter how much of a bluff it might be on Eve 's part . FRASER Very likely . EVE I thought perhaps you meant to see Fred and have a talk with him ? BECKY No ! MRS . LINDON and LAURA exchange glances , as BECKY , rising , rings bell right . What good would that do ? To have the reconciliation mean anything it must be of his own volition . He must come for you , Eve , because he misses you , because he wants you back . MRS . LINDON joins LAURA on the sofa and talks in a loud and excited whisper to her as to BECKY 'S very evident prevarication . SERVANT enters right ; BECKY speaks to him aside , amusedly watching them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ? p. 12 EVE I believe there 's another woman in it ! BECKY laughing. I knew she was jealous ! To MRS . LINDONThat 's just the sort of thing that has made quarrels all along between you and Fred . She comes to her . EVE Well , if you knew all I 've had to forgive Fred , and all I have forgiven , you 'd realize I had good reason always for my share of the quarrels . BECKY Listen to me , Eve . You 're a luckier woman than you know ! EVE startled.How do you mean ? LAURA puts her hand on EVE 'S shoulder to calm her . BECKY Because , instead of having the forgiveness always on his side , you have the blessed privilege of doing the forgiveness yourself . MRS . LINDON gives a falsetto snort . You may smile if you like  --  EVE interrupting.Oh , no , thank you . I do n't feel at all like smiling ! BECKY Well , honestly , I envy you . Takes EVE 'S hands in hers . MRS . LINDON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to BECKY . You know I love Tom with my whole heart  --  and it 's a big heart for a little woman  --  and yet I keep him forgiving me  --  forgiving me something or other all the time . I 'd be afraid his forgiveness would wear out , only it 's in his soul instead of his body , and if our bodies wear out , our souls do n't  --  do they ? Already at the very beginning of our life together I owe him more dear forgiveness than I can ever repay , and believe me , Eve , such a debt would be unbearable for a woman unless she adored her husband . p. 13 EVE You 've too much sentiment  --  I 'm practical . BECKY sitting down in the chair at center.Does being practical give you one half the happiness my " sentiment " gives me ? EVE Nonsense ! My sympathies are with the one who has the forgiving to do . BECKY You mean , like all selfish people , you sympathize with yourself , so you 'll never be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , angry.If ? What do you mean by that ? Looks at BECKY , then at LAURA , sharply , then back at BECKY . BECKY smiling.Say when instead !  --  when you get Fred back . Trust me , teach yourself to be grateful that it is you who have to forgive , and not the other way round . EVE Rises , facing her , almost triumphantly , fully persuaded that BECKY is in the wrong . I knew when I came here you 'd make excuses for him . BECKY smiling.You 've misunderstood me . I 'm trying to make them for you . EVE Thank you . You need excuses more than I do . p. 14 FRASER Rises , alarmed . Eve ! EVE I am perfectly well aware that I made a very serious mistake in coming to you of all women ! BECKY Rises . In that case I think it best to consider the matter closed between us . EVE You can think what you please , but I have no such intention ! FRASER Eve ! She sits again on the sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 've said enough to-day . We 'd better go . BECKY I should have to ask you to excuse me in any case , as I have an engagement in a few minutes . MRS . LINDON looks meaningly at LAURA . EVE To BECKY . I intend to have the whole thing out now ! WARDER enters left . WARDER is a strong and sensible , unsuspicious man ,  --  no nerves and no " temperament , " nothing subtle about him ; he is straightforward and lovable . TOM Oh , excuse me ! BECKY No , come in , Tom ; it 's Laura and Mrs. Lindon . LAURA and MRS . LINDON say " How do you do , " as WARDER comes into the room . He greets them in turn . BECKY writes in pencil on a sheet of paper on the desk. p. 15 TOM I wanted to ask Becky if she wished to go to a theater to-night . BECKY Yes , I should like to . She indicates to TOM that she wants EVE and LAURA to go , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , but you really must excuse me . Slipping into WARDER 'S hand the note she had secretly written . Mrs. Lindon and Laura are going . What are you going to do now ? MRS . LINDON looks again meaningly at LAURA . TOM I thought I 'd go round to the club till dinner . BECKY relieved.That 's right . I shall be engaged till half past six ,  --  er  --  Mrs. Clayton is coming to see me about the Golf Club at Roslyn  --  and  --  lots of things . You need n't hurry back . She gives him an affectionate little squeeze of the arm and goes out right . He looks down at the paper slyly and reads it . EVE Rises and goes to TOM . Tom , if you 've nothing in particular on at the club , would you give me half an hour ? FRASER Rises and goes to EVE . Eve , you have n't the time yourself ; you must come with me. p. 16 TOM suppressing a smile as he finishes reading the note ; he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know ,  --  I 'll tell you how it is  --  EVE Oh , I do n't mean here ! I know Becky wrote you a note telling you not to let me stay , did n't she ? TOM laughing.She did  --  you see , she has an engagement . Reading from the paper , good-naturedly . " Get rid of Eve , I want the room . " EVE At six o'clock . Glances meaningly at LAURA . TOM casually.Is it ? EVE To see Fred in ! FRASER Eve ! be sensible ! TOM No , it 's for Mrs. Clayton about Roslyn . EVE Then , why must she be rid of me ? Georgia Clayton and I are the best of friends , and I have as much to do with Roslyn as Becky . TOM still pleasantly.I suppose Becky has a good reason , if she cared to tell us . EVE I know Becky has an appointment here , at six , with Fred . p. 17 FRASER You do n't know it , Eve ! EVE I do . TOM still pleasantly.In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? EVE You know Fred ? TOM Yes ! EVE Well ? TOM You do n't want my opinion of Fred , at this late day ! I also know Becky ! EVE Becky and Fred meet every single day . FRASER Interpolates . She thinks so . TOM What are you talking about ? EVE What I know ! And if you 'll wait here with me a few minutes now , in spite of what Becky said , you 'll see Fred and not Mrs. Clayton arrive . TOM If your husband is really coming , it was probably to spare you that Becky spoke of Mrs. Clayton , and I should n't think of embarrassing her by waiting . EVE disagreeably , irritatingly.Oh , you do n't mind , then ? TOM Almost any man , my dear Eve , would mind your husband meeting his wife every day ! I only think you 've been misinformed , or only half informed , that 's all . p. 18 EVE You are aware that Fred and I have been separated for two months ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her watch.It 's almost six now . Come , Eve . TOM going toward the door , left. Yes , I 'm afraid I must ask you  --  Rings electric bell on wall beside the door . EVE going to him.Tom , for the sake of our boy and girl friendship , walk home with me , and let me speak plainly . FRASER on the other side of WARDER.Mr . Warder , please do n't go . EVE To LAURA , angrily . What do you mean ? To WARDER , pleadingly . I 've no other man in the world to go to ; I need advice . Wo n't you give me yours ? TOM Looks at her a moment , hesitates , then says . My advice ? Of course , if you wish that . The SERVANT appears in the doorway in answer to the bell . To SERVANT . My hat and coat  --  and say to Mrs. Warder I 'm walking home with Mrs. Lindon . He goes out left. p. 19 SERVANT Yes , sir . Follows him out . LAURA looks significantly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there soon wo n't be a soul left in New York whose advice you have n't asked and not taken ! EVE Well , it 's my own trouble ; I can do what I like with it . What are you going to do now ? She sits in the armchair at the left . FRASER going to her.do n't tell him all you think you know about Becky . EVE Think ! FRASER It will be a very great mistake . EVE Laura , I 'll tell you the truth ; I 've had Fred watched by private detectives for over a month , and I have a list of dates and places of their meetings to more than prove what I say . FRASER How dreadful of you ! EVE Oh , wait till you get a husband , and then you 'll sympathize more with a woman who is trying to keep one ! FRASER But these places where they meet ? EVE Are respectable so far as I know . But daily meetings my dear , daily ! p. 20 FRASER And you 'll tell Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall tell . What are you going to do now ? FRASER Wait till to-morrow ! Give yourself time to recover , to consider . EVE Simply repeats . What are you going to do now ? FRASER Deliberately crosses to the chair at center and sits . Stay and see Becky . EVE Rises , delighted . Oh , do ! Stay till Fred comes , and catch her ! FRASER No , no ! I 've finished with this now . I do n't sympathize with what you 're going to do . TOM with hat and coat , in the doorway left.Ready ? EVE Yes . TOM Good-bye , Laura . FRASER Good-bye . MRS . LINDON goes out left with WARDER . After the outside door is heard to close BECKY comes into the room hurriedly . She stops suddenly on seeing LAURA , turns and tries to steal out . Just as she gets to the door , LAURA catches her . Becky ! BECKY turns and their eyes meet . BECKY laughs , realizing she is caught. p. 21 BECKY Oh , you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of Eve to-day ? FRASER Not enough of you . BECKY Sings instead of speaks . " Thank you ! " She puts her arm around LAURA , and they sit on the sofa . FRASER Becky , why wo n't you be frank with Eve ? BECKY I was . FRASER No , you did n't tell the truth about seeing Fred . BECKY Oh , that ! FRASER Yes , that ! BECKY I may have seen him once or twice , that 's all . FRASER Exactly what Eve says  --  you do n't tell the truth ! BECKY It 's false ! I never told a malicious lie in my life . I never told a fib that hurt any one but myself ! FRASER Tell Eve the truth . Make her have confidence in you . She says if you cross the ferry to Jersey City , you say you 've been abroad . BECKY laughing.Well , so I have ! Laura ! I 'm doing my best to make Eve happy . I ca n't do any more than my best , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own way ! p. 22 FRASER You 've seen Fred to-day . BECKY No , I have n't . FRASER Becky ! He came home with you just now ! BECKY What makes you think so ? FRASER I saw his back on the steps with you . BECKY Oh , I see  --  spying on me ? Well , you made a mistake in the back . FRASER I know it was Fred Lindon . BECKY And I know it was n't . FRASER You 're not seeing him every day ? BECKY Certainly not ! But what affair is it of yours , if I do ? FRASER We 're all friends , and you 're making Eve wildly jealous . BECKY That is entirely her own fault , not mine . The SERVANT enters left with a bill on a small silver tray . SERVANT Pardon me , madam , a man with a box and a bill to collect . BECKY taking bill.A bandbox ? She opens bill . SERVANT Yes , madam . p. 23 BECKY To LAURA . Oh , my dear , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw it on my way here and could n't resist buying . Are hats a passion with you ? FRASER uninterested.Yes , rather . BECKY I told them to send it C.O.D. , but I did n't suppose it would come till tomorrow and I have n't a cent ! FRASER I thought you said you won a hundred and fifty at bridge ? BECKY No , no , my dear , you misunderstood me ; I lost . To SERVANT . Tell the man if he ca n't leave the box , to take it back and call later ; say Mrs. Warder is out . SERVANT Yes , madam . Goes out with the bill , left . FRASER You said you won at bridge ! BECKY Oh , you tedious person ! You hang on to anything like a terrier , do n't you ! I said I won because I did n't want Eve to think I 'd lost ; I never can bear to own up I 've lost anything before Eve . Laughs , pulls LAURA by the arm . Goodbye ! FRASER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have an engagement . p. 24 FRASER With Fred Lindon ! BECKY It is not . SERVANT enters and announces " MR . LINDON . " LINDON follows in . He is surprised to see LAURA , but instantly covers his surprise . Going to LINDON , quickly . Oh , what a surprise ! FRED Surprise ? Am I early ? BECKY indicating LAURA.Sh ! Yes , surprise . LINDON sees LAURA and makes an amused grimace . But I can only give you a very few minutes . I have an engagement , have n't I , Laura ? As they shake hands . FRED Oh , hello , Laura ! FRASER very dryly.How d ' you do , Fred ? FRED How 's Eve ? FRASER embarrassed.Very well  --  at least not very  --  yes , she is of course very well ! She 's just left here . She adds this pointedly . FRED Oh ! sorry I missed her ! Give her my regards when you see her , and say I 'm glad she 's well . He goes to the piano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rises indignant . I shall do nothing of the kind . She starts to leave the room . LINDON runs what he is playing into " Good-bye , little girl , Good-bye . " BECKY offering her hand.Good-bye . FRASER Pretends not to see BECKY 'S hand . Good-bye . She goes out left . BECKY going to the piano.They both saw you come back with me ! FRED still playing , improvising . Laughing.No ! Did they ? BECKY laughing.Yes , but it 's no laughing matter ! Eve is jealous . FRED Stops playing . What right has she ? Did she expect me to sit alone in the drawing-room for two months straining my ears to hear her ring the front door bell ? He continues playing . BECKY They know we 've been meeting every day  --  at least they think so . Have we ? FRED still playing.No ! p. 26 BECKY Yes we have ! Have n't we ? FRED Stops playing . Well , yes , if you want the truth . BECKY Goes to sofa and sits . There 's no use telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed of  --  I did it with the best of motives . FRED Goes to BECKY . Oh , do n't spoil it all , Becky , with motives ! He leans over the arm of the sofa to talk to her . BECKY Laughs . You know Eve must n't be jealous of me ! FRED earnestly.Now you 're not going to let her break up our little  --  BECKY interrupting.Fred , how much do you like me ? FRED smiling.I dare n't tell you ! BECKY No , I mean really ! FRED So do I ! BECKY I believe you are fond of me . FRED I am ! BECKY And I like you to be . p. 27 FRED placing his hand on hers on the sofa 's arm.Because ? BECKY slowly drawing her hand from his.I like men to like me , even though it really means nothing . FRED Nothing ? Rather chagrined . BECKY amused.I like it for myself , and besides I think it 's a compliment to Tom ! FRED mockingly.Oh ! Oh ! I say ! Becky ! He moves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing her . BECKY But with you there was a special reason . FRED Is encouraged . Draws a little nearer to her . Yes ? BECKY Of course you have perfectly understood why I 've seen so much of you . FRED You 've been my friend . BECKY I 've sympathized with you . FRED You 've been the only real glimpse of happiness I 've had for months in my life . BECKY do n't be rhetorical ! no man sounds sincere , when he talks pictures . I 'll tell you why I wanted you to come back this afternoon . p. 28 FRED taking her two hands.To make me happy ! BECKY pulling her hands away , and patting his half seriously.Yes he leans over toward her , by making you realize it 's time you went to Eve and asked her to come back . FRED sinking back in his chair.Nonsense ; Eve 's made a row and frightened you . BECKY How frightened me ? I always meant when I 'd got you where I wanted you , to influence you to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an odd way of showing it . He rises and leans against the mantel beside the sofa . BECKY You do n't want every woman to show her love in the same way . FRED I do n't want any other woman to show me she loves me in Eve 's way . BECKY Come now , you 're unfair to Eve ! I 'm going to sympathize with her a little . Granted that she is jealous , granted that she does n't always control her temper !  --  what woman worth while does ! FRED laughing.But she ought to trust me  --  as you do . p. 29 BECKY laughing.Oh , I 'm not your wife . I would n't trust you for a minute if I were married to you ! FRED How about Tom ? BECKY Of course I trust Tom . FRED And I trust Eve . Laughing . BECKY Oh ! but it 's not the same thing . You trust Eve because you do n't care enough . I trust Tom because  --  well , in one little word , he is perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve 's proved she loves you with a big love ! She 's proved it by forgiveness . That 's the proof of a love it 's not easy to get and even harder to deserve ! You 've got it  --  he moves toward her.We wo n't go into the deserving part ! But if only half that she says and one quarter of what every one else says of you is true , you ought to go on your knees to her in gratitude if she is willing to take you back . FRED Sits on the arm of sofa , half laughing . She will ! She 's left before . BECKY You love her , Fred ? FRED casually.No , I love you ! p. 30 BECKY Nonsense ! I mean really ! Promise me you 'll go to Eve to-morrow and ask her to come back . FRED Slides down on to sofa . Not yet  --  give me another month ! BECKY You 'll lose her ! FRED No , there are certain things you ca n't lose  --  try as hard as you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been urging you to do this . BECKY Nothing of the sort ! She 's too proud . And she must n't dream I 've had anything to do with your going to her . No woman really wants to accept her happiness like a pauper at the Lady Bountiful hands of another woman . She might think she was grateful to me , but she would n't be ! With a disposition like Eve 's you 'd have another quarrel inside a fortnight . No ! Eve must think you 've come to her spontaneously because you ca n't live without her . He whistles . She rises . You can whistle , but you 'll never get another woman half so good to you as Eve ! Make her think you want her back . Make yourself think you want her back , and you do n't know how happy you 'll be  --  first in making her happy , and second in finding you are yourself . He takes hold of her hand ; she draws it away quickly and sits in the armchair on the opposite side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away over there ? BECKY Oh , I thought it was getting a little crowded on the sofa . FRED And must I give up my visits with you ? BECKY Of course . FRED Oh , well , if that 's the price , I do n't want happiness , it costs too much ! BECKY You wo n't need sympathy any more . You can write me a little note and say : " Becky , I thought I loved you , but it was only a heart being caught on the rebound . Thank you for being sensible and pitching the heart back ! Thank you for seeing my real happiness was in making Eve happy . " FRED You know that does n't sound like me ! BECKY Not like your foolish old you , but like your sensible new you , who has found out you can have a woman friend without getting sued for damages ,  --  which has been your usual experience , I believe ! FRED Becky ! do n't rob the graves ! BECKY Well , will you go to Eve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! BECKY Fred ! The price of my friendship is your peace with Eve ! p. 32 FRED going to BECKY.But if I consent , I may come to see you ? BECKY Yes . FRED Eve , my darling wife , forgive me ! Come to my arms and stay there  --  for five minutes  --  consider it done ! Where , to-morrow ? BECKY The Metropolitan ? FRED No , let me come here to-morrow , and what time ? BECKY Rises . Four  --  but to say Good-bye ! She means it . The last visit ! FRED Oh ! well , we wo n't cross that bridge till we come to it ! and I 'll make you a bet if you ever do send me away for good , do you know what will happen ? BECKY amused.No , what ? FRED In a day or two you 'd send for me to come again after all ! BECKY laughing.Why ? FRED Because you like me better than you think you do ? BECKY going to the writing-table.Oh , really ! ! FRED following her.Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge it to yourself , still you know just how strong my feeling is for you . p. 33 BECKY turning toward him. But I do acknowledge it , and I am grateful and pleased to have you care for me . She pulls the chair beside the table in front of her . FRED pushing chair away . " Care for you ! " BECKY pulling chair back.Yes ! and I want to show my appreciation by making you happy . FRED Eve 's jealousy has frightened you , but you 'll forget it to-morrow ! BECKY really not understanding.How do you mean ? She looks at him questioningly , innocently . He looks back knowingly with a half smile , not believing her . A pause . WARDER comes in left . He looks from one to the other , then speaks pleasantly . TOM Oh ! How are you , Lindon ? FRED Good-evening , Warder . Both men stand ; an awkward pause . BECKY sitting in the armchair right.Sit down , Tom . He does so on the chair by the table . LINDON sits on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come uptown generally as late as this ? TOM Oh , no , I 've been up some time . Second awkward pause . BECKY Did you get the theater tickets ? TOM No , I forgot ; I did n't go to the club . I 'll telephone from here . Very casually . Has Mrs. Clayton gone ? BECKY Who ? TOM Mrs. Clayton . You said  --  BECKY interrupting . BECKY Mrs. Cl  --  ? Oh ! Yes ! She 's gone . Awkward pause . FRED Have you been to the club ? TOM very casually.No , I walked back with your wife to her mother 's . Awkward pause . BECKY and LINDON exchange glances . FRED half-humorously.I hear Eve is looking very well . Pause . TOM By the way , will you have a whiskey and soda , a cocktail or something ? BECKY Or tea ? p. 35 FRED Tea ?  --  poison to me ! No , thanks , I must be getting on . All rise ; then , after a moment of embarrassment , WARDER speaks . TOM Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dinner at seven . BECKY It 's your own fault ! Think how well Eve looks in a dinner dress , and what a delightful hostess she always is . FRED Yes , Eve 's all right in a crowd ! Shaking hands . To WARDER . Forgive my domestic affairs intruding . Mrs. Warder has been kind enough to advise me a little ! Good-bye ! Going . TOM I 'm sure her advice is good . You 'd better take it ! FRED Perhaps !  --  but in homopathic doses ! To BECKY . Good-bye ! To WARDER . Bye , Warder . Laughing , he goes out . WARDER and BECKY , alone , look at each other  --  BECKY questioningly , WARDER half puzzled . BECKY Well ! Has Eve been weeping on your bosom , too ? TOM No , I think she scratched it , if she did anything ! p. 36 BECKY half amused , half worried.How do you mean ? The SERVANT enters with a letter which he gives to BECKY . When did this come ? SERVANT A little while ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goes out . WARDER gives BECKY a quick , sharp look , which , however , she does n't notice . BECKY From father ! He ca n't want more money already ! TOM You sent him how much two days ago ? BECKY Goes above the writing-table as she opens the letter . You sent him , you generous darling , three hundred dollars . I had given him his allowance the beginning of the month . TOM And gone already ! Of course , he 's been at the races this week ! No more . Becky  --  is it true you 've been seeing Lindon every day lately ? BECKY while she reads her letter.No !  --  yes ! Looks up at him . I mean no , certainly not ! TOM smiling.Which is it ?  --  or do I take my choice ? BECKY with a little laugh.I 've seen something of him . I 'm sorry for him .  --  Father 's in more trouble . p. 37 TOM That 's an old story , and this is something new . Eve is jealous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Fred Lindon ? TOM No ! BECKY Goes quickly to him and kisses him and pushes him down on to the sofa . Bless you ! You 're right , and that 's my answer to Eve !  --  Father does want more money ! TOM We send no more till next month , not one penny . Come here ! He makes her sit on the arm of the sofa beside him . She puts her arm about his neck and hugs him . WARDER continues . You have n't seen Lindon almost daily for the past month , have you ? BECKY No . TOM You have n't met him by appointment at the Metropolitan , Eden Muse , or any such places ? BECKY Eve 's jealousy gives her the most ridiculous ideas ! When I have been with Mr. Lindon , it has been principally to talk about Eve , and entirely with the desire to try and reconcile them . TOM Grant that ! But it 's not true about all these appointments ? BECKY No ! TOM with his arm about her waist.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 38 BECKY Than all the world , and every world , and all the planets put together , Mars , Saturn , and Venus . Yes . I love you even more than Venus ! Laughing and giving him another caress . TOM I have every confidence in you and your motives . But I have none in Lindon 's  --  so I want to-day 's visit to be his last , my dear . BECKY rising , a little uncomfortable.All right . TOM Own up , now , has n't he tried to make love to you ? BECKY leaning on the back of the chair , facing him.No ! TOM Not a bit ? BECKY smiling.Well  --  maybe  --  just a tiny bit  --  but not in earnest . TOM rising , angrily. I was sure of it ! the damn puppy ! Becky , I 've heard him swear there 's no such thing as a decent woman if a man goes about it in the right way ! BECKY Oh , you men are always hard on another man whom women like . TOM I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . BECKY with dignity.I judge by his behavior to me . He may have led me to believe he likes me very much ,  --  he ought to like me , I 've been very nice to him ,  --  and I suppose it flattered me  --  smilingit always does flatter me when men like me ,  --  and I think one feeling I have is pride that you have a wife whom other men admire ! If Mr. Lindon has made  --  er  --  respectful love to me , that 's a compliment to you . WARDER laughs , sincerely amused . But he has not insulted me. p. 39 TOM smiling.That 's your fault . You are the kind of woman he does n't believe exists , and he ca n't make up his mind just what tactics to adopt . BECKY He knows perfectly , unless he 's deaf and blind , that my seeing him  --  a few times only  --  has been solely to reconcile him with Eve . TOM That sort of man is deaf and blind except to his own rotten mental suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so let it go , dear . BECKY Places the letter on the writing-table and sits behind it . Eve has frightened you ! TOM Walks away . Not a bit ; I laughed at her fears that you were fascinated by her precious worm ! But I do consider that unwittingly you have been playing a dangerous and  --  forgive me , darling  --  going to hera very foolish game . Already some one believes you 've been seeing Lindon every day . You have n't ! But that does n't make any difference ! Every one will believe you have seen him twice a day in another month if you continue seeing him at all . No woman can have the " friendship " of a man like Lindon for long without  --  justly or unjustly  --  paying the highest price for it . He places his hand tenderly on her shoulder . You would n't know what the price was till the bill came in  --  and then no matter how well you knew and those who love you knew you had not danced , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 40 BECKY I do your sex greater justice than you ! I do n't believe there 's any man , no matter what he has been , whom some sincere woman ca n't waken to some good that is in him ! TOM smiling.That 's all right , but you please let Eve wake up Lindon ! He moves away . Had you made any arrangements to ring a little friendly alarm on him to-morrow ? BECKY No ! And that , of course , was Eve 's suggestion ! TOM Well , never mind so long as it 's understood his visits here are at an end . You do n't expect him to-morrow , and should he come , you wo n't see him , eh ? BECKY Exactly ! Smiling . When I told him to-day his visits were over , what do you think he said ? TOM I could n't guess . BECKY He said I 'd change my mind and send for him ! TOM And if you did , do you know what he would do ? BECKY No  --  what ? TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one take you in his arms and kiss you ! BECKY Rises . He would n't dare ! p. 41 TOM I 'm not sure , but at any rate I am serious about one thing in this discussion . BECKY Goes to him and places her hands lovingly on his arms . Our first " domestic row . " TOM Turns her about and holds her in his arms  --  she leans against him . And last ! BECKY Amen ! TOM very seriously.And I echo the sentiment , I know , of every sane husband in New York  --  Lindon 's attentions to a man 's wife are an insult , and as your husband I wo n't have them . BECKY leaving his arms , pushes him playfully into a chair and sits near him in the corner of the sofa.Well , give me my woman 's last word . I still think you are unfair to him  --  but I love you all the same ! ! TOM You 'd better ! BECKY I 'm so afraid you 'll get  --  not tired , but  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find you twice the same ! Now  --  what about your father ? BECKY He only wants fifty dollars , and says he must have it ; let 's send it . p. 42 TOM No , that 's the way it 's been always . Our " no " has always ended " yes , " so of course he has n't believed in it . This time it must stay " no . " BECKY plaintively.You wo n't send it ? TOM No , and you must n't . BECKY Oh , I have n't got a cent . But he says he 's in real trouble and he must have it . TOM It 's always the same thing ! And we must put a stop to his inveterate , indiscriminate gambling . If we do n't teach him the lesson he needs soon , before we know it he will be in real trouble that ten thousand times fifty dollars might n't get him out of . BECKY But he promises not to  --  TOM interrupting.My dear ! He has given his word over and over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't a race course , it 's a bucket shop  --  or some cheap back door roulette table , and it 's got to stop ! Stop now ! BECKY But , Tom  --  TOM interrupting.Now , Becky ! You know how hard it is for me to refuse you . BECKY It 's only  --  TOM interrupting.You must trust my judgment , and your father must learn , and a small matter of fifty dollars is a good chance to begin ; it ca n't be so very serious ! so that 's ended . p. 43 BECKY half-humorously , half-discouragedly.Yes , I guess it 's ended ! TOM Now , will you try to realize that I only want to do what 's best and right ? BECKY Kisses him . Yes , but I ca n't help feeling sorry for father . Smiling . The SERVANT enters left with a bill and a bandbox . SERVANT Beg pardon , madam , but the man has come back . BECKY Takes the bill . Oh , my hat ! Very well , I 'll ring when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SERVANT Puts bandbox on the chair at left . Very good , madam . He goes out . BECKY smiling , embarrassed.I 'm nearly as bad as father ! TOM Lose at bridge to-day ? BECKY No , I did n't play to-day , but I could n't resist a hat , my dear , the most adorable hat ! WARDER laughs " Oh , Becky . " No , honestly ! Much more beautiful than the one I bought day before yesterday ! I 'm ashamed , but I did order it to come home , and I have n't a penny . p. 44 TOM teasing her.Send it back ! BECKY Oh , you would n't be so heartless !  --  and what would they think at the shop ? TOM getting out his pocketbook.How much is it ? BECKY Hesitates a moment . Fifty dollars ! TOM with a slight quizzing look.Just what your father wants . BECKY Yes ! Give the money to father and I 'll send back the bonnet . TOM No , my darling . You know it is n't the money with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've not got the money , I must write a check . He looks for the check-book . She quickly gets a check-book from table and hides it behind her back . BECKY Your check-book 's upstairs . She rings the bell on the desk . TOM I thought perhaps yours was here ? BECKY No , mine 's used up , as usual ! TOM All right . He goes out right , as the SERVANT enters p. 45 BECKY opening the bandbox.Send the man here , Jenks . SERVANT Yes , madam . He goes out , left . BECKY Takes out the hat and looks at it admiringly . What a duck ! Heaves a great sigh and puts it back and starts to re-tie the strings , as the MAN enters . I want you to take this back to Mme. Flora , and say Mrs. Warder is extremely sorry , but Mr. Warder has taken a violent dislike to the hat , so she can not have it . She will be in later to choose another . MAN Yes , ma'am . He goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and starts to write a letter hurriedly . WARDER comes in with check . BECKY hides the letter she is writing . TOM coming to the table.Here 's the check , all but the name of the payee . Where 's the bill ? BECKY Make it out to me , and I 'll indorse it . TOM Why ? BECKY Half worried , half smiling . Oh , dear ! I told you a sort of fib ! The hat was only thirty-five dollars , but I wanted the extra fifteen for something else . Please do n't be angry  --  p. 46 TOM laughing. I 'm not angry , though you know I dislike even little fibs . Why did n't you tell me if you 're hard up ? I 'll give you this and make out another for the bonnet shop . BECKY No , you need n't do that ; the man 's gone now for the change  --  I told him . TOM Finishes the check and gives it to her . Becky ! you 're not going to send this to your father ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takes the check . And now you get dressed . I 'll be up in a minute . You know it always takes you twice as long as it does me when you wear a white tie ! It 's a long play and begins early . TOM I 'll bet you I 'll be dressed before you start ! He hurries out , right . BECKY Rings the telephone on the desk . Hello ! Hello , 6304 -- 72d . Writes on her interrupted letter with one hand and listens with the receiver in the other . After a moment . Hello ! 6304 -- 72d ? Is Mr. Lindon  --  yes , ask him to come to the ' phone and speak to 2759 -- 38th . Listens as she writes . Hello ! Is that you ? Yes  --  yes  --  Oh laughs , do n't be silly ! I called you to say I am very sorry , but our engagement for to-morrow is off ! O double f ! No , for good ! For Good ! She adds very quickly . Good-bye ! Hangs up the receiver and writes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first she ignores it ; then she makes a grimace at it ; then she takes up the receiver . Hello ! No , Central , I was n't cut off . No , I do n't want the number back ; thank you , I hung up the receiver . I ca n't help that ! You need n't re-connect us  --  say the line is busy ! Hangs up the receiver . Mercy ! when you do n't want them ! ! Rings the electric bell on the desk , indorses the check , puts it in the letter , and seals the envelope . The SERVANT enters as she addresses letter . I want you to take this at once and put a special delivery stamp on it . I want it to reach my father in Baltimore to-night . p. 47 SERVANT Yes , madam . BECKY Have you any idea whether it would be delivered there to-night or tomorrow morning ? SERVANT One or the other , madam . BECKY smiling.That I know ! Make haste . The SERVANT goes out left , as WARDER all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , right . She rises quickly . TOM Who 's ready first ? BECKY laughing.Oh , you 've raced ! But while you 're tying your tie I 'll  --  TOM Interrupts . No , I came down purposely to get you to tie it for me ! He stands ready . BECKY Ties it during the following speeches . You forgive me for telling you that little fib ? TOM Yes , if it 's to be your last one . BECKY My very last . TOM No more of those wicked little white lies , even , that you know you do amuse yourself with , and distress me ? BECKY No , no ! Really ! I 've opened the cage door and let all the little white mice fibs out for good ! p. 48 TOM And you do love me ? BECKY Do you want to know how much I love you ? TOM Yes , how much ? BECKY How deep is the ocean in its deepest spot ? TOM As deep as your love for me . BECKY Oh , that is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tie is finished , and she pushes him playfully into the chair by the writing-table . One good turn deserves another . With her arms about his neck she slides on to his knee , like a child . I 've let Perkins go out , and you must hook me up the back . And both laugh gayly as he embraces her and the curtain falls. @x At the Warders ' early Saturday afternoon , just after lunch . The same scene as Act I. BECKY and WARDER are sitting on the sofa , both drinking coffee after lunch . WARDER puts his coffee-cup on the table as the curtain rises . BECKY Are n't you going to smoke , darling ? Putting her coffee on the table behind her . TOM Yes . Getting out cigar . BECKY Give it to me . She takes it , and cuts the tip with a gold jeweled cutter which she wears on a chain about her neck . For six years you 've not smoked a cigar in my presence that I have n't clipped , have you ? TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That has n't cut off any tips for  --  Lindon , I hope ! BECKY No , indeed ! He only smokes cigarettes . TOM amused.Is that the only reason ? BECKY Oh , you darling ! I believe you are a little jealous of Lindon and I adore you for it . Hugging and kissing him . TOM Well , you go on adoring , but I 'm not a bit jealous of Lindon . Rises , and lights his cigar with a match from the table behind them. p. 50 BECKY You 're not going back to the office ? It 's Saturday . TOM No  --  I think I 'll have a game of racquets with Billy Weld . BECKY Do ! You love it so . I 've regretted their invitation to dine with them next week , Friday . I said we 're going out of town . TOM But we 're not . We 've people dining here , have n't we ? BECKY Yes , but I think going out of town sounds so much more interesting . Besides , then they ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace 'll be consumed with curiosity , too , as to where we 're going ! Amused . TOM But if they see us Friday ? BECKY They 'll think we have n't gone yet . TOM But if Billy meets me downtown Saturday morning ? BECKY He 'll think you took an early train back . TOM The truth 's so simple , so much easier  --  why not tell it ? BECKY Do n't worry , it 'll be all right . I 'm sorry I told you if you 're going to worry ! He goes to kiss her ; she stops him . TOM sitting beside her. What 's up ? p. 51 BECKY I 've decided I kiss you too often . I 'm a shopkeeper with only one line of goods  --  no variety , and I 'm cheapening my wares . WARDER laughs . I do n't want you to feel you 're getting a left-over stock of stale , shopworn kisses ! I want you to feel the supply does n't equal the demand . She kisses him . The SERVANT enters and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BECKY To WARDER . Eve ! To SERVANT . Ask her to come in here and have a cup of coffee and a cigarette . SERVANT Yes , madam . Goes out . BECKY beaming.Come to tell us of the reconciliation ! TOM Why she did n't let him go and be thankful ! I do n't see what she can love in a little outsider like Lindon ! BECKY Thank Heaven , all women do n't love the same kind of a man ! Steals a caress . Think what an awful fight there 'd be ! SERVANT coming back.Mrs . Lindon sends this message  --  she wishes to see Mr. Warder . BECKY and WARDER look at each other , surprised and amused . BECKY makes a grimace. p. 52 TOM Very well , show Mrs. Lindon in . SERVANT Yes , sir . Goes out . TOM More trouble ! BECKY They 've quarreled again already ! It must have been his fault . SERVANT shows in MRS . LINDON and goes out . EVE To WARDER , not noticing BECKY . How do you do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do , Eve ! Sit down . EVE I wish to see Tom for a moment , Becky . BECKY What for ? EVE I wish to see him alone . BECKY Why ? EVE That , Becky , is my affair  --  and his , perhaps ! BECKY Oh , really ! I suppose I ought to become very jealous now , and do dreadful things . Smiles . But do n't have me for a moment on your mind , Tom . Kisses her finger , puts it to TOM 'S lips , he kisses it , and she goes out right . TOM What is it , Eve ? You know I have no earthly secrets from Becky . p. 53 EVE It 's about her secrets from you ! TOM Nonsense ! Half laughs . EVE sitting in the chair by the table near center.I only hinted at things the other day  --  and only hinted at one half the truth . TOM sitting on the sofa.Excuse me , Eve , but you 've got hold of the wrong half . I asked Becky outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you said . EVE You ca n't make me believe you 've lived as long as you have with Becky Roland and not found out  --  she lies . TOM Rises quickly in anger . It 's because you 're a woman you dare say that to me , but you know I do n't have to listen to you , so do n't push our old friendship 's claim too far . EVE I said Becky and Fred met often on the sly . TOM sitting again.Which is n't true ! EVE No ! They meet every day ! TOM Eve , I think your trouble has gone to your brain . EVE still quietly , but with the quiet of the crater when the volcano is alive beneath.I can prove to you that Becky has seen Fred every day and more than that ! When we had our talk two days ago , they had agreed together that he was to go through a form of reconciliation with me for appearance ' sake , and their meetings were to continue . She had an appointment with him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , for she swore to me the opposite . EVE Yes , you frightened her off and she broke the engagement by telephone , which made Fred perfectly furious ! TOM rising , goes to mantel and knocks his cigar ashes into the grate ; absolutely unconvinced , he continues with a cynical smile.And how did you obtain this decidedly intimate information ? EVE in an outburst , the volcano becoming a little active.From him ! I knew they had n't met for two days  --  TOM interrupting.How ? He looks up curiously . EVE Rises and turns away , a little ashamed . I 've had Fred watched for weeks ! TOM astonished , rises. You mean you 've  --  He hesitates . EVE Yes ! Coming to the desk , and speaking across it to him . I took their not meeting for a sign that after all Becky had given him up , and I had the impulse to go to him  --  to go back home . He turned on me like a wolf  --  said I 'd meddled with his affairs once too often  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been on the point of making up with me for the reason I 've told you , but now it was done for ! I 'd raised your suspicions , I 'd given the whole thing away to everybody , and I could congratulate myself on having broken off his and my relations for good  --  forever ! Oh , how could he insult me so when it was only his love I was asking for ? She sinks down in the chair above the table , and buries her face in her hands and sobs. p. 55 TOM Forgets himself and exclaims . But can you  --  how can you still care for him after everything you 've gone through ? It 's beyond my understanding ! He throws his cigar angrily into the fireplace . EVE The history of the world is full of women who love like me , but no men  --  I do n't know why ; but I suppose that 's why you ca n't understand it . Why could n't he realize it is for happiness not appearances I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know when he means what he says  --  and he told me , like a low brute , I could go to  --  where you can imagine  --  for all he cares , or for all he 'll ever live with me again . Her voice fills up again . TOM I should think if you went to the address he proposed , it would insure at least an eventual meeting ! EVE who has not heard and does not understand.What ? TOM I beg your pardon ! I made a foolish joke ! Well ? With a hearty long breath of relief . Now do you feel better ? EVE feebly , not understanding.Better ? TOM Yes , now you 've got it all " off your chest " ? To-morrow you 'll be all right and ready to forgive again . Shall I call Becky ? Going toward the bell beside the mantel. p. 56 EVE Rises . You 're going to accuse her before me ? TOM Stops and turns . Accuse her ? Laughs . No  --  I do n't believe a word you 've told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sworn statement any day . EVE going to him.Then here 's yesterday 's report from the agency !  --  and Thursday 's , and Thursday 's includes the report of the telephone central who connected Becky with our house when she broke off the appointment with Fred  --  that telephone girl has told us many interesting things ! TOM Stop ! Stop this ! I wo n't listen to you  --  at any rate , not behind Becky 's back . I 'm not a jealous , suspicious woman with good reason to believe the worst . I 'm a straightforward , decent man , I hope , and I know I 've every reason to believe absolutely in my wife , God bless her ! He moves away and then turns upon her . Why have you come and told me this , anyway ? EVE staggered.Why  --  why ? TOM angry.Yes , why ?  --  to me of all people ! I was the last person you should have told , as a matter of breeding , as a matter of tact , as a matter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just it ! TOM Do you dream what it would mean to me to shake even by a miserable tremor my confidence in my wife ? But you have n't ! EVE I thought , and I still think , it 's to your advantage to know . TOM with a complete change of voice , from anger to the tone one adopts with a silly child.My dear Eve , while I do n't for a minute excuse him , still I do now understand , perhaps , how even Fred Lindon must have found your ideas of devotion at times over the endurance line . EVE You do n't understand  --  I thought if you knew everything , together we could separate them  --  could arrange something . TOM Eve ! Believe me , there 's nobody to separate in this case ; there 's nothing , so far as I and mine are concerned , to arrange . He goes again to the bell by the mantel . EVE Who are you going to ring for ? TOM You know . EVE stopping him quickly.Not before me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want a public revenge or triumph ; that 's not the feeling I have . TOM What in the world do you mean ? He rings . Becky will deny the  --  p. 58 EVE interrupting.Very likely ! But these proofs are uncombatable , and if that 's her attitude , I shall go straight from your door to the divorce court . She places the envelope of reports on the table with a blow . TOM Goes to her . You 're mad ! If your proofs are all right , then Becky 'll not deny , she 'll explain them . You forget you can only see everything red now , but I 'm sane and quiet and sure smiling , and I see things in their true color . You must be guided by me in this . He takes her hand almost cruelly and speaks strongly , with the manner and voice of the man who is and means to remain master . Do you understand that ? She draws her hand away as if in pain . I beg your pardon . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons who do more harm than the people who are purposely malicious . You are to take no step without my sanction . BECKY comes in with a certain air of bravado . BECKY Excuse me , I heard the bell and I was waiting  --  am I right ! TOM Goes to her . Come right in , dear . BECKY Well ! Has Eve thrown a bomb , or a trump card ? Am I to be taken into the secret or conspiracy or what ? p. 59 TOM after a second 's pause , in which he thinks how to begin.Eve has convinced herself , and would convince me , of some very  --  he thinks for the word  --  wrong  --  worse than wrong things , but I prefer to be convinced of the contrary by you . And I prefer to come to you with my confidence , my conviction complete . And together we 'll try to keep Eve from harming others as well as herself and Lindon  --  the latter seems unavoidable . EVE pushes her papers on the desk pointedly nearer to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seeing Lindon often , but every day . BECKY Do you want me to deny it ? TOM indulgently.I want you to tell the truth . BECKY Of course , the accusation and the idea behind it are absurd . WARDER turns and looks at MRS . LINDON , who meets his glance and then looks down at the evidence on the table , pushing the papers a little farther toward him . He does not follow her glance . BECKY half laughs . It 's like a trial , is n't it ! By what right does Eve  --  EVE interrupting.The supreme right of any married woman who cares for her husband . Shall I be more explicit ? p. 60 BECKY No , you need n't trouble ! What next , Tom ? TOM Eve claims you had an engagement with Fred  --  Hesitates , trying to remember the day . EVE quickly.Day before yesterday . TOM Which you broke off over the telephone . BECKY How does she know that ? Does she tap our wire ? Merciful Heavens , Eve , you 've become so morbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fred  --  and everybody else apparently . EVE Ha ! TOM But is this true , Becky ? BECKY to gain time.Is what true ? TOM About this appointment with Fred which you broke over the  --  BECKY interrupting.Of course not ! TOM who begins to doubt her.If it were , you could easily explain it , I 'm sure . Hoping to suggest this course to her . BECKY her head lost.Of course  --  but there 's nothing to explain ! The whole thing 's false ! What do you take me for , Eve ? If you think I 'm a home destroyer , you 've made a mistake in the bird ! And what do you mean by coming into my precious home and trying to make trouble for me ? Sitting on the sofa , frightened , and almost in tears. p. 61 TOM Wait a minute , Becky , it 's partly my fault . BECKY It is not ! I know whose fault it is , and I must say that , at last , I do n't blame Fred Lindon ! EVE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I 'm excited like this I speak the truth straight out , no matter what happens ! TOM Well , really it was I who insisted on your joining us , against Eve 's will . To MRS . LINDON . Your way was best . It was my man 's point of view  --  To BECKY . And you are right , under the circumstances , no doubt , to answer as you do . BECKY My dear Tom , there 's no other way to answer . TOM Looks at her , then takes up the envelope containing the detective reports and holds them tightly in his hand . He comes down to MRS . LINDON . If you will leave us alone , I will go over the whole matter with Becky  --  by ourselves will be much better . EVE I need hardly tell you those papers are most valuable to me . BECKY looking up , her curiosity aroused.What papers ? Nobody answers her . She tries to see. p. 62 EVE Will you promise me not to let them out of your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . EVE as she moves to go , stops.You will find the entries which are of particular interest to you marked on the margin with a red cross ! TOM satirically.Thank you ! BECKY rises and rings for the SERVANT . MRS . LINDON goes out . BECKY coming to meet WARDER.I think I 'm a pretty good-natured woman to let Eve  --  TOM Stands before BECKY with his hands on her shoulders , making her look straight into his eyes . Now be careful , dearest . You 've married a man who does n't understand a suspicious nature  --  who has every confidence in you and the deepest  --  a confidence that could n't be easily disturbed ; but once it was shaken , every unborn suspicion of all the past years would spring to life full-grown and strong at their birth , and God knows if my confidence could ever come back . It never has in any of the smaller trials of it I 've made in my life So you 'll be careful , wo n't you , dearest ? I mean even in little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best light to my life , but it 's a live wire  --  neither you nor I can afford to play with it . Goes to the writing-table and takes the papers out of EVE 'S envelope. p. 63 BECKY Tom , you frighten me ! Eve has made you jealous again . Goes to him and puts both arms about his neck . Now , my darling , I give you my word of honor I love only you and never have loved Fred Lindon and never could ! Say you believe me ! TOM have n't I always believed you ? BECKY Ye  --  s . TOM But if I find your word of honor is broken in one thing , how can I ever trust it in another ? BECKY Of course you ca n't  --  but you need n't worry , because it wo n't be broken . TOM Then , now we 're alone , tell me the truth , which you did n't tell me when you said you ' d not seen Lindon often . BECKY Turns away . It was the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not every day ? BECKY Sits in the chair by the writing-table . How could I ? TOM Nor telephoned him Thursday , breaking off an engagement after you told me absolutely you 'd parted with him for good  --  and had no appointment ? BECKY Of course not ? The idea ! But she shows she is a little worried . Eve Lindon never could tell the truth ! p. 64 TOM The telephone girl must have lied , too , or else the statement was made out of whole cloth . Throwing the envelope on the desk . BECKY What statement ? TOM sitting on sofa.From these detectives . He begins to look through the papers . BECKY Detectives ! Stunned . What detectives ? Picks up envelope and looks at it , puts it back on desk . TOM Eve 's , who have shadowed her husband for the past two months . BECKY thoroughly alarmed.You do n't mean  --  TOM Interrupts , not hearing what BECKY says ; his thoughts on the papers which he is reading , he speaks very quietly . These certainly do make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BECKY It 's not true ! TOM Though not so very many here . Turning over a fresh paper . BECKY Rises , gets above desk . All ! All the meetings there have been  --  practically . This is simply awful ! Eve is capable of making the most terrific scandal for nothing . Do n't let her , Tom , will you ? Tear those things up ! p. 65 TOM smiling indulgently , not taking her seriously.Becky ! BECKY leaning over the table , stretches out her hand toward him. Well , let me ! Let me take them from you without your noticing till it 's too late ! TOM seriously.You 're not serious ? BECKY I am ! TOM You heard me give Eve my word ? BECKY To a mad woman like that it does n't count . TOM I wonder just how much your word does count with you , Becky ! BECKY with great and injured dignity.It counts everything ! TOM They seem to have hit on some very out-of-the-way places for your rendezvous . He smiles . Where is Huber 's Museum ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupts herself quickly . I do n't know where it is ! She moves away to collect herself . TOM still smiling.And why the Washington Heights Inn in February ? Or the Eden Musee ever ? p. 66 BECKY Of course , some one else has been mistaken for me . TOM Looks up . Ah ! yes , that 's a very possible idea . BECKY Goes to the sofa and sits beside him . Tom , do n't read any more of the horrid things ! Listen to me , do n't let Eve go on . She 'll ruin everything if she does . He 'll never forgive her , never take her back . TOM reading and smiling.I did n't know you skated ! BECKY I always loved skating . I only gave it up because it bored you . But I did n't skate then ! TOM When ? BECKY I  --  I do n't  --  oh , whenever that beast says ! TOM St. Nicholas Rink , Friday , February eighteenth . He has noticed the slip she made , but hides the fact ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband have had a big row , and he swears he 'll never see her again , not even in the other place , that she 's come between you and him and that he 'll never forgive . He finishes seriously , his bantering manner gone . BECKY Oh , how untrue ! I do n't believe he said any such thing . Eve 's jealous mind has distorted something else . The reason for our friendship  --  he rises with a half-angry movement , goes above the table looking for the envelope  --  such as it is  --  was to bring Eve and him together . p. 67 TOM From your point of view . BECKY No , believe me , he is n't as bad as you think . TOM showing the papers.And what about these ? They agree with me . BECKY If you believe those papers about him , then you must believe them about me . TOM coming to her.Heaven forbid , Becky ! They would prove you a liar and a terrible one  --  which you 're not , are you ? BECKY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if I thought you had deceived me to such an extent  --  I could never trust you again so long as I lived , Becky . BECKY Shall you speak to Mr. Lindon about them ? TOM No , I would n't insult you by discussing you with Lindon , unless I was convinced every word and more here was true . I will see Eve to-morrow and perhaps get hold of these detectives myself . BECKY almost trembling with dread.And now go and have your game . You need it ! You 're getting morbid . You 'll be believing these beastly things if you do n't get some exercise . TOM What time is it ? p. 68 BECKY She looks at clock on the mantel , and speaks with her face still away from him . Three . When will you be back ? She conceals her anxiety to hear his answer . TOM Oh , six , I suppose . BECKY facing him with a certain relief.Not till six  --  you 're sure ? TOM Yes , you know your father 's coming and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgot all about father 's telegram ! If it 's money , I 'm to be firm ? TOM Absolutely . BECKY taking hold of the envelope which he has in his left hand away from her. What are you going to do with those ? TOM You heard me tell Eve they should n't go out of my hands except into hers . He gently but firmly removes her hand from the envelope . BECKY And you meant it ? TOM Do n't you mean a promise you give like that ? BECKY Yes , of course TOM taking out his keys.I 'm going to put them away in my room . I want to have a thorough , careful look through them later . Of course I ca n't let it rest here . The detectives must learn their mistake at once . p. 69 BECKY Yes , of course . But you are going to the Welds ' now for your game ? TOM Yes , good-bye . Presses her hand . Gives her a tender but questioning look , but does not kiss her , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . Dear God in Heaven , if I ever get out of this , I 'll never tell another lie so long as I live ! She turns to the window . Smiles to WARDER outside and throws him a kiss , but afterward her face at once assumes its frightened look . Coming from the window , she sinks upon the piano stool . He 's got to save me ! Now he can prove that he is worthy a decent woman 's friendship . She goes to the telephone and calls . Hello ! Hello ! She suddenly realizes . But I ca n't use the telephone ! Central has told things already ! She hangs up the receiver . The telephone bell rings . I must write him . The bell rings again . She takes up the receiver and speaks angrily . Hello ? No , I did n't ring . You 've made a mistake . Hangs up the receiver . You telltale toad you ! She writes . " If this note reaches you in time , please come over "  --  I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour she looks up at the clock  --  " at half past three . " Seals note and addresses it . " Important . " Which she underlines. p. 70 SERVANT entering left , announces.Mr . Roland . ROLAND is an elderly , dried-up little man with an air of the dandy jockey still clinging to him underneath his gray hairs and dyed mustache . A vivid carnation is in his buttonhole and a somewhat rusty springiness in his gait . ROLAND coming in jauntily.Hello , Beck ! BECKY with fictitious spirit.Father ! He starts to kiss her , forgetting the ever-present cigarette in his mouth ; then he stops to remove it , and does kiss her . ROLAND How are you ? BECKY I 'm awfully glad to see you , but you ca n't stay long . Excuse me just a moment . Jenks , I want you to ring for a messenger and give him  --  stops  --  no , when he comes , send him to me . She has started to give JENKS the note , but changes her mind . JENKS bows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might I have a glass of brandy ? I took coffee after lunch on the train and it 's poisoned me . Must have been canned coffee ! BECKY Very well , Jenks . The SERVANT goes out left. p. 71 ROLAND lolling on the sofa.What the devil did you mean by sending me fifty dollars instead of five hundred ? BECKY surprised.I read it fifty ! I never dreamed you 'd ask for five hundred more ! Going toward him . ROLAND I wrote five hundred and I must have it ! BECKY My dear father , it 's impossible . I tried as it was to get a little more from Tom , but he said " no , " to send you the fifty dollars , with his love , but not one penny more , and to make you understand  --  and , father , he means it  --  that for the future you must keep within your allowance . The SERVANT enters with the brandy on a salver , and pours out a liqueur glass full . ROLAND But you 'll help me ? BECKY sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and in the future I 'm going to do what Tom wishes , and never deceive him even in a little thing again . To the SERVANT who hands the glass of brandy to ROLAND . The messenger boy has n't come yet ? SERVANT No , madam . BECKY If he does n't come in five minutes , ring again . p. 72 SERVANT Yes , madam . Starting to go , ROLAND stops him . ROLAND Not so fast ! He points to the glass which he has emptied and the SERVANT pours out another glass . ROLAND takes it and puts it on the table behind him . The SERVANT busies himself with gathering up the after-dinner coffee-cups and trying to overhear all that he can . BECKY How is Mrs. Crespigny ? ROLAND That woman will be the death or the marriage of me ! BECKY Do n't be absurd , father ! She 's given you the most comfortable home you ' ve had for years . In that letter she wrote me she said she 'd been a real mother to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide her hand ! her trumps are marriage . BECKY Nonsense ! Mrs. Crespigny must realize the difference in your positions . ROLAND You have n't lived with her social souvenirs as I have for four years ! The SERVANT starts to take up the glass which ROLAND has put aside , but the latter stops him . The SERVANT has delayed over his work as long as he dares in his desire to listen , and now goes out left . Becky , are you and Tom hungering for a mother-in-law ? p. 73 BECKY I do n't know what you mean ? ROLAND It 's a question of five hundred dollars for me or a new Mrs. Roland ! BECKY astounded.You do n't mean you owe Mrs. Crespigny that money ? ROLAND Well , I 've not paid my board bill as regularly as I might have wished . BECKY Rises , indignant . I 'm ashamed of you ! ROLAND I 'm ashamed of myself , but shame wo n't pay bills ; if it would , there ' d have been many an unpaid debt washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a messenger boy . SERVANT The messenger , madam . BECKY goes to the boy . During BECKY 'S talk with the messenger , ROLAND fills his pocket with cigars from the box on the table . BECKY I want you to take this note to its address , but only leave it in case the gentleman is in . Do you understand ? MESSENGER Yes , ma'am . BECKY And come back and tell me . MESSENGER Yes , ma'am . He goes out with the SERVANT , who has waited for him. p. 74 ROLAND I confess , my child , I have flirted a little with the dame in question . BECKY Father ! ROLAND I have , in a way , led her on ! BECKY And you always told me my mother 's memory was the one precious thing left , that you meant to keep always untouched by your life ! ROLAND I do n't deny , Becky , I ' d be ashamed of it . I do n't pretend Mrs. Crespigny would be a solace or a substitute ; she would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but what she threatens to become unless I pay is a legal necessity ! BECKY Could she do that ? ROLAND I have been obliged at times by desperate need of ready money to suggest to her certain things as probabilities which were barely remote possibilities ! And unfortunately  --  unfortunately  --  once or twice in writing . BECKY She has compromising letters of yours ? ROLAND She has a large collection of illustrated postal cards from every place I 've been since I lodged with her  --  they are her chief artistic dissipation  --  and a double set of Baltimore Duplicates , which I am afraid are the most foolish ; as I am in the habit of making up with her in that way after little tiffs when she takes the stand of not being on speaking terms with me. p. 75 BECKY Father ! You ' ve been a terrible idiot . ROLAND I have , my dear ! BECKY Ca n't you get those cards back ? ROLAND The rent due is " Mother 's " price for them . Rising . You will make Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll promise not to make such a fool of myself again . Sitting on the arm of the sofa , drawing BECKY toward him and putting both his arms about her . BECKY Tom 's idea now is that you deserve all you get . He ' ll say you deserve Mrs. Crespigny . Leaving him , she goes above the table . ROLAND Oh , come , she 's not so bad as that ! BECKY How old is she ? ROLAND She has told me several ages . The general average would make her about forty-seven and a quarter . BECKY Pretty ? ROLAND A fine figure of a woman and plays an A-one game of piquet . BECKY I see ! When did her husband die ? ROLAND He did n't die . He stole from the bank in which he was employed and went to jail , and she says for social reasons she was naturally obliged to take advantage of the divorce law . I have a suspicion myself he may have preferred jail ! p. 76 BECKY Comes quickly to him . Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ! It 's degrading to me and to my mother 's memory for you to accept any sort of indulgence at that woman 's hands ! When we get her paid , you must leave her house . ROLAND That I ca n't and wo n't do , because I 'm far too comfortable ! SERVANT entering left , announces.Mrs . Crespigny ! ROLAND Jumps up . Mrs. who ? MRS . CRESPIGNY comes in flamboyantly . She is a woman past the age of uncertainty , dressed gaudily , with an hour-glass figure ; she has innumerable bracelets and bangles , and an imitation jeweled chain flaunts a heavy pair of lorgnettes , like a gargoyle hanging over a much-curved bust . Enormous wax pearls in her ears are in direct contrast to the dark beginnings of her otherwise russet-gold hair . Neither her shoes nor her stays fit , and both are too tight . She is brightly rouged , and yet the very failure of the faade reveals , somehow , the honest interior of a human if forlornly foolish female . CRESPIGNY Excuse me for intruding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mis ' Warder , I take it ? BECKY bows. p. 77 ROLAND angrily. What do you mean by following me here ? CRESPIGNY after a severe look at him , turns back to BECKY.I want you to know the facts as between your father and me , and just how the matter is , and get your support that I done right ! To ROLAND . I know your daughter is a lady if you ai n't , and being a lady myself I have a certain pride . To BECKY . I 've had a good deal of trouble persuading your father that though a lady sometimes takes in a paying guest she still holds her own in the social scale . I have friends of my own in the New York Smart Set ! My niece married a Mr. Gubenhamers and lives in a perfectly elegant house of her own on Lennox Avenue . Do you know her ? One thousand two hundred and fifty-three ? BECKY No . CRESPIGNY Oh , do n't you ? Well , of course I know New York is big . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in a way a relation ? You will know her by name  --  Mrs. Otto Gurtz , President of the West Side Ladies ' Saturday Afternoon Social Gathering ? BECKY No , I 'm afraid I do n't know her . CRESPIGNY Well ! I guess you do n't read the Harlem society notes in the papers ; if you did , you 'd know what she stands for socially . p. 78 BECKY Suppose we keep to the reason of your visit  --  I understand my father owes you money  --  MRS . CRESPIGNY turns sharply to ROLAND  --  and that you insist on being paid , which is natural  --  CRESPIGNY A trumped-up story ! Going to ROLAND . I guess I done just about the right thing to chase on here after you ! I 'm sorry to say it , Mis ' Warder , ' specially as it ai n't exactly ladylike , but your father , with all his superfine qualities , is a liar ! Yes , ma'am , between us two as ladies , he 's an ornery liar ! Sinks into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes up to the window . BECKY Mrs. Crespigny , would n't it be better to behave more like a lady and talk less about one ? Why break into the house of a woman you do n't know and make a scene over a matter of rent due you  --  CRESPIGNY It ai n't the rent ! It 's all a question of horses . When he left my house this morning , he said he was leaving for good unless I let him have  --  ROLAND interrupting her.Mrs . Crespigny ! You 're hysterical ! You 're saying things you 'll regret  --  SERVANT entering , left.The messenger has come back , madam . p. 79 BECKY Oh , I want to see that boy ! Excuse me a minute . She hurries out and the SERVANT follows her . ROLAND I knew you were in the train ; that 's why I stayed in the smoker . And it decided me to keep my word never to go back to your house ! He sits determinedly in the armchair at left . CRESPIGNY And you told her I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more sympathy with my betting than you have ! I would n't tell her the money was to put on Wet Blanket , Monday ! CRESPIGNY Rises and goes to him . No , you ' d rather let her think I was a grasping harpy , when you know , if the truth 's told , you owe me at least five times five hundred dollars with your borrowings and your losses at cards ! ROLAND smilingly.You have n't won lately . CRESPIGNY Do you know why ? ROLAND Oh , of course ! You got out of the wrong side of the bed or you dreamed of a black horse ! CRESPIGNY pathetically and a little ashamed.No . I 've let you win a-purpose  --  because I was ashamed for you to owe me any more money . I 'm trying to keep a little pride in you somehow , even if I have to cheat to do it . She almost breaks down again , and turning away , takes a powder puff from a little gilt box and powders her nose to cover up the traces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's pleasant for me to owe you money ? A kind friend like you ! Going to the mantel and flicking his cigarette ash in the fireplace . One reason I want to take advantage of this tip for Monday is to pay you if I win . CRESPIGNY Yes , and then go board somewhere else ? Is that your idea ? Or to stay here ? ROLAND Well , my daughter and her husband want me . Leaning on the mantel.They say their home is my home . CRESPIGNY going toward him , alarmed.But you wo n't stay , will you ? I left word with Josephine to have your favorite meenoo cooked for a late supper in case you ' d come back . We 'll have a game to-night . I 'll play you a rubber for the five hundred  --  it 's against my conscience to give it to you outright for horseracing . ROLAND Loan it to me ! CRESPIGNY Yes , of course ! I always mean loan . Oh , the flat 'd be just too dreadful lonesome without you ! Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warder comes in ! Wo n't you ? ROLAND coming toward her . Well , if you make it a personal favor to you in this way , I ca n't exactly refuse ! And that ends the most serious quarrel we 've had yet . p. 81 CRESPIGNY embarrassedly.If we was man and wife , there would n't be any need of such quarrels . The money 'd be yours then to do as you liked with . ROLAND Do n't tempt me ! You know you 're a great deal too kind to me as it is and I 'm no good to take as much advantage of you as I do . CRESPIGNY Oh , pshaw ! Say ! I wish you ' d help me to get on the right side of your daughter . You 're too delicate to say anything , but I always suspect it 's her that stands between us . BECKY coming back. I 'm very sorry , but you must go at once . I have an important engagement here in a few minutes and must change my dress . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made an arrangement with Mrs. Crespigny that is agreeable to her , without Tom 's and your assistance  --  BECKY alarmed.Father , not  --  ROLAND Shakes his head . It seems I exaggerated my indebtedness a little and Mrs. Crespigny exaggerated her desire to be paid this month and  --  CRESPIGNY Yes , I was just mad clean through and would have said anything ! p. 82 BECKY Well , I 'm glad it 's settled , but it seems a pity you could n't have accomplished it without the railway journey , especially as I must ask you to excuse me at once . She guides MRS . CRESPIGNY toward the door left , but MRS . CRESPIGNY , instead of going out , makes a circle around an armchair and settles herself in it . BECKY goes despairingly to ROLAND . CRESPIGNY Oh , I do n't regret the trip over , because I 've been dying to meet you , Mis ' Warder , ever since I had the pleasure of knowing your father in a taty-taty sort of way . And we can catch the four-fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her hand . I 'm sorry I ca n't ask you to stay . CRESPIGNY Oh , I can come over nearly any day ! I 've got such a perfectly lovely servant girl now . I give her every night out and she works like a dog all day  --  and you can trust her with everything ! Ca n't you , Mr. Roland ? ROLAND You can trust her with me all right . MRS . CRESPIGNY laughs loudly . BECKY Father ! CRESPIGNY Ai n't he killing ! Do you inherit his sense of humor ? He can get anything he wants out of me with just one of them wittycisms . ROLAND winks aside to BECKY . Of course , I wo n't say that he ai n't an expensive boarder  --  BECKY sinks in the chair near center , discouragedbut I consider he cuts both ways and at the finish the ends meets . p. 83 BECKY I think I gather what you mean . I 'm afraid you 'll lose your train ! CRESPIGNY I mean it 's hard for a lady what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because usually the boarders is beneath what the lady 's been accustomed to and she do n't feel at home with ' em . Now with your father it 's different , because he 's a Roland and I 'm a Crespigny . BECKY Oh , is that your own name ? I thought  --  ROLAND interrupting.No , Mrs. Crespigny 's maiden name was Ruggles . CRESPIGNY Yes , mamma made what we 'd call a messyliance ,  --  married beneath her , you know . But she never descended , nor allowed us to neither , to papa 's social level . Mamma was a O'Roorke . You know , one of them early high-toned families that came over from Amsterdam in the Mayflower . BECKY I see ! CRESPIGNY Mamma often said to me , says she , " Jennie  --  " BECKY with her patience exhausted , jumps up , interrupting her . I must say good-bye now  --  I 've no time to dress . She hurries out right . CRESPIGNY rising. Well , do you think I made any sort of a hit with her ? p. 84 ROLAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not quite my daughter 's style . CRESPIGNY But why not ? She seems real refined . ROLAND groans . WARDER comes in left . He does not see MRS . CRESPIGNY on his entrance . TOM Hello , father ! I did n't think I was going to have this pleasure . I had an engagement to play racquets with Billy Weld , but he broke down in his motor somewhere between Tuxedo and here and I could n't wait . MRS . CRESPIGNY comes a few steps and beckons to ROLAND to introduce WARDER . ROLAND Mrs. Crespigny , Mr. Warder . CRESPIGNY Bows . Pleased to make your acquaintance . She turns away with a rather grand manner . WARDER looks from her to ROLAND and shakes his head , then goes to the writing-table with some letters he has brought in from the hall . ROLAND Excuse me one moment . Beckons to MRS . CRESPIGNY and whispers to her aside . Wait for me ! CRESPIGNY In the hall ? ROLAND Lord , no ! At the station ! p. 85 CRESPIGNY Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you should ever be coming over to Baltimore , Mr. Warder , why , just drop in ! She goes out left . TOM Where 's Becky ? ROLAND going to him.She 's upstairs . I just wanted to thank you for the money you sent me day before yesterday . TOM What money ? ROLAND The check for fifty dollars Becky mailed me . TOM Starts , but controls it immediately . Oh , a check for fifty dollars  --  ROLAND The joke on me is that what I wanted was five hundred ! Digs TOM in ribs . TOM looking off where BECKY went , absorbed in his thoughts.Oh , five hundred ! ROLAND Yes , just five hundred . He looks at WARDER , and waits ; hums a song and dances a few steps . Nothing doing , I suppose ? TOM No . Father , the fact is  --  ROLAND Yes , I know , Becky told me . Excuse me , I 've got to catch a train . Good-bye , my boy . p. 86 TOM with his thoughts elsewhere.Good-bye ! ROLAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WARDER stands a moment thinking , then takes out his key-chain . SERVANT entering , shows in LINDON.Mr . Lindon to see Mrs. Warder , sir . WARDER looks up with a start , which he immediately controls , and disguises completely his thoughts and emotions . FRED How are you , Warder ? TOM Speaks very casually and pleasantly , with complete self-control . Good afternoon , Lindon . Sees SERVANT about to go to BECKY , stops him . Jenks ! JENKS goes to him . WARDER gives him a key from his chain . Go to my room and get me a large blue envelope from the upper righthand drawer of the desk . SERVANT Yes , sir . He goes out left . TOM Excuse me , Mrs. Warder is out . She 'll be sorry . FRED surprised.Out ? TOM Yes . FRED But surely there must be some mistake ? p. 87 TOM No , I 'm sorry . I assure you she 's out . FRED Oh ! Then do you mind if I wait ? TOM Is that scarcely worth while ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warder is out for her usual bridge afternoon . FRED I think , on the contrary , she must be surely coming back , and if you do n't mind , I 'll wait . TOM with an apparently good-natured laugh.I do n't like to insist against your apparently superior knowledge  --  FRED also smiling.No , no , it 's only a note I received a few moments ago at the club . Here it is . Takes it from his pocket . That she must see me this afternoon . You know your wife is kindly acting as intermediary between Eve and myself . It is in regard to that . He hands the note to WARDER , who glances at it and returns it without reading . As it only came half an hour ago , I feel sure Mrs. Warder must expect to return soon . SERVANT entering with an envelope , which he gives to WARDER.That is all I can find , sir . TOM humorously.That 's all I want , so it 's all right . Jenks , am I wrong in understanding that Mrs. Warder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Warder is in , sir . TOM Oh ! I beg your pardon , Lindon . FRED That 's all right . TOM To JENKS . Jenks , say to Mrs. Warder , Mr. Lindon is here . You need n't say anything about me . I 'm off . SERVANT Yes , sir . Goes out right . FRED I 'm not driving you away , I hope . TOM Oh , no , I have some important papers to go over . Make yourself comfortable . Good-bye . FRED Thanks , old man . Good-bye . He sits on the sofa , as WARDER goes out left . FRED Well ! She did send for you , Freddy , old son ! Now 's your chance ! SERVANT rentering.Mrs . Warder will be down at once . FRED Thank you . The SERVANT goes out left . LINDON goes to the piano and sings a verse of a song , " Everything comes to him who waits , " etc . An idea comes to him . He weighs it , accepts it , smiles , and stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He rises . BECKY hurries in from the right and goes quickly toward him , crying , " Fred ! " in a tone of distress and excitement . She leaves the door open behind her . LINDON , before she realizes what he is doing , has met her , taken her in his arms , and kissed her . She forces herself away from him , standing for a moment speechless with rage and astonishment. p. 89 FRED I told you , did n't I , Becky . Tries to embrace her again . BECKY slowly and deliberately.That 's just exactly what Tom said you 'd do ! FRED What ! BECKY Ten to one , he said , if I sent for you again , you 'd kiss me . FRED in alarm and astonishment.Yes , but what  --  BECKY But I would n't believe him ! I said , and I believed , he did you an injustice . FRED So you talked me all over with him , did you ! Then why did you send for me to-day ? BECKY Because I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dear Becky  --  BECKY Oh you 'll hear more and worse than that if you stay to listen ! I advise you to go ! You ca n't help me . I do n't trust you . You might even make matters worse . It may have been all done purposely as it is . FRED Oh ! BECKY You see I 'm ready to believe all I 've heard of you , now that you 've shown your true silly self to me in that one sickening moment , and I 'd rather not be saved at all than be saved by you ! She leans for a second against the corner of the writing-table. p. 90 FRED How saved ? From what ? BECKY Never mind ! I only want to say one more thing to you and then go , please . But I want this to ring in your ears so long as you remember me ! There is only one man in this world I love , and that 's Tom , and there 's only one man I despise , and that 's you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ! I know now what our friendship meant to you and I wish I could cut out of my life every second of every hour I 've spent with you ! I 've been a fool woman , and you 've been a cad ,  --  but , thank God , there are men in the world  --  real men  --  and one is my husband . Now , go , please ! Eve 's a fool not to jump at the chance of getting rid of you and I shall tell her so . She turns away from him with a movement of dismissal . FRED going toward her. Do ! For that , at least , I shall thank you , as well as for our delightful friendship , which I am sorry to have end so contrary to my expectations . BECKY with her eyes down , speaks in a low , shamed voiceThis room is too small for you and me at this moment ,  --  which leaves ? He smiles , hesitates a moment , then sits in the armchair at left . BECKY gives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LINDON rises quickly. p. 91 FRED No , no , I was only joking ! I 'm sorry you take the whole affair so seriously . Allow me . He bows and goes out left . BECKY Stands quietly thinking a moment , then makes up her mind . Eve herself is the one to help me ! But I ca n't go to her till I 'm sure she 'll listen and understand  --  Laura ! She sits by the table and takes up the receiver of the telephone . Seven eight Plaza . Yes ! It 's a lady this time , so I hope you wo n't have to listen ! Hello ! Is Miss  --  Oh , is that you , Laura ? Can you come over at once ? I am in dreadful trouble ! Oh , well , after dinner , then ! No , I was going out , but I wo n't  --  it 's too important . You were right  --  and Eve 's right , too . Never mind , I ca n't tell you over the ' phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . You can prevent a real catastrophe that has no need to happen .  --  Oh , that 's all right , do n't stop another minute , then . Thank you with all my heart . She hangs up the receiver , gives a long sigh , and sits worriedly thinking . WARDER comes in , serious but calm . Looking at him , half frightened , she makes a great effort to be natural , and to be in a good humor . Hello , Tom ! Your game finished already ? TOM We did n't play . Weld did n't get back to town . Any callers ? p. 92 BECKY No . TOM I thought I saw some one leaving  --  from the top of the street . BECKY Did you ? Oh ! it was probably father ; he came . TOM No , I spoke with your father some fifteen minutes ago . He told me about the money you gave him . A second 's pause ; BECKY looks down and then up at him . BECKY Are you angry ? TOM You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was so sorry for him  --  that 's why he came to-day ; he said he must have it ; I could n't refuse him and you were n't here ! TOM He said you mailed him my check day before yesterday . BECKY is silent , trapped , frightened . A pause , then she speaks in a low voice . BECKY I 'm so sorry  --  A second 's pause . TOM It looked to me like Fred Lindon . BECKY , more frightened , realizing what is hanging over her , like a drowning person who can not swim , flounders helplessly about in the next few speeches , trying to save herself by any and every means that she thinks may help her for the moment. p. 93 BECKY Well , I 'll be honest , it was Fred Lindon ! TOM anger getting the best of him . After everything  --  your word of honor , Eve 's accusations , my absolute desire  --  you sent for him to come and see you ! BECKY No , no , you must n't think that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course ,  --  I suppose to see if I would see him ! I did n't know it ! TOM wary , suspicious , to lead her onThen , why did you see him ? You could easily excuse yourself . BECKY No , you do n't understand . She flounders hopelessly . I did n't know it was he ! Do n't you see ? TOM No , I do n't see ! Watches her with a face growing harder and harder with each lie she tells . BECKY But I 'm telling you  --  it was just like this ; I was upstairs and Jenks came  --  and said a gentleman wanted to see me in the drawing-room . Just that , do n't you see  --  a gentleman . She sees the doubting look in his face and , mistaking it , tries to make her story more plausible . I was surprised , too , and said , " Who ? " and Jenks said the gentleman gave no name  --  He turns sharply away from her , unable to face her as she tells the lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought so then . I suppose Jenks considered it a joke ,  --  and I suppose he did n't give his name for that very reason , for fear I would n't see him  --  WARDER , looking up as if to stop her , sees the door right open and quickly closes it . Of course the moment I came into the room and saw who it was , I excused myself , and he left . p. 94 TOM in a voice not loud but full of anger and emotion . Lies ! all of it ! Every word a lie , and another and another and another ! BECKY breathless with fright , gasping.Tom ! TOM going to her.You sent for him ! She is too frightened to speak , but she shakes her head in a last desperate effort at denial . Do n't shake your head ! I know what I 'm talking about and for the first time with you , I believe ! She puts up her hands helplessly and backs away from him . I saw your note to him ! She starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I read it here , in this room ; he gave it to me before you came down . BECKY The beast ! TOM with biting satire.You 're going to misjudge him too ! BECKY No , Tom , I 'll tell you the truth and all of it ! TOM Naturally , now you 've got to ! BECKY No  --  wait ! I did send for him  --  it was to tell him about those papers of Eve 's . TOM Yes , you must plan your escape together ! p. 95 BECKY No ! because I still believed he was decent . I thought it was his duty , that he would claim it as his right , to prevent such a scandal as Eve threatened to make , which he knew I did n't deserve . TOM Hah ! BECKY You may sneer , but I do n't ! Yes , I broke my promise to you  --  what else could I do ? You would n't let me send for him ! And he came ! And he did what you said he would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and kissed me . She bends over the back of the chair at center on which she is leaning , and sobs . TOM Goes to her , speaking with bitter irony . Charming ! And you turned on him , of course ! Played the shocked and surprised wife and ordered him out of the house ! BECKY Yes . But I did ! Why do you speak as if I did n't ? TOM Do you expect me to believe this , too ? BECKY facing him. I do n't expect ,  --  you 've got to ! TOM Do you think you can go on telling lies forever and I 'll go on blindly believing them as I have for three years ? BECKY Even you could n't have turned on him with more anger and disgust than I did ! p. 96 TOM I could n't believe you if I wanted to ! You 've destroyed every breath of confidence in me ! BECKY It 's the truth I 'm telling you now ! TOM In everything  --  everything that has come up since my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie ! BECKY It 's the truth ! It 's the truth ! TOM Continues , hardly hearing her . The money to your father , the first lie , and to-day made a double one ! All this rotten evidence of Eve 's  --  another dozen ! Your promise that Lindon 's visit Thursday should be his last , the next ! BECKY I meant it then  --  I meant it truthfully . TOM ignoring her interruption.His visit after all to-day  --  that led of course to a mass of lies ! And then the truth ! He kissed you ! And then another lie and another dozen to try and save yourself ! BECKY quietly , in a hushed , frightened voice.By everything in this world and in the next that I hold dear and reverence , I 've told you the truth at last . TOM You do n't know what 's true when you hear it or when you speak it ! I could never believe in you again ! Never have confidence ! How could I ? Ask any man in the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes away from her , to control his anger , which threatens to get the best of him. p. 97 BECKY sobbing.No , no , Tom ! Do n't ! do n't say that ! You must believe in me ! You must believe in me ! TOM after a pause , collects himself and comes to the writing-table.Becky , you and I must say good-bye to each other . We must finish separately . A silence . She looks at him in dumb horror and surprise . Do you understand ? BECKY in a low voice.No ! TOM We must separate . Quietly  --  no fuss , no divorce unless you wish it . A pause ; she does not answer . He goes toward her and repeats . No divorce unless you wish it . BECKY with simple but deep pathos.I love you . TOM You must stay on in the house for the present , till you can make your plans . That will help keep the thing quiet , too . BECKY Tom ! Do you really mean all you 're saying ? Do you realize what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? TOM Yes . BECKY To-morrow , perhaps  --  ? TOM No . I shall go to Boston to-night for a few days ; when I come back , you may have settled on something . If you have n't , I can manage all right . I do n't want to press you about that , only  --  p. 98 BECKY I will not stay in your house one single day without you . TOM You 'll have to ! My price for hushing up Lindon and Eve , and every one else , is that you on your side act with dignity , and as I think wisest . BECKY going to the armchair at left.No ! A woman like me whose heart is breaking , whether she 's right or wrong , ca n't act like that . She ca n't do it ! She sinks into the chair , bursting into tears . TOM beside her.Try . For your sake as well as mine . Good-bye , Becky . BECKY with the tears choking her voice. I told you the truth the last time . Oh , ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going . BECKY I love you and only you and you always  --  TOM Turns in the doorway . The club address will reach me ! He goes out , closing the door behind him . BECKY sits still a moment thinking ; then she goes to the writing-table , rings the bell , and takes up a time-table . Her hands drop upon the table in utter dejection and her head lowers as the tears come again fast and thick. p. 99 SERVANT entering left. Yes , madam ? BECKY controlling her emotion and hiding as best she can the traces of it.Tell Perkins to pack my small trunk and hand-bag . I am going to Baltimore to spend a day or so with my father . SERVANT Yes , madam . BECKY And then come back , please . SERVANT Very good , madam . Goes out . BECKY taking up the telephone.Hello ! 78 Plaza . As she listens for the answer she looks about the room , the control goes from her face , and the tears come once more ; she brushes them away and tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is , however , plainly evident . Hello ; I want Miss Fraser please . Oh , ask her to call me the minute she 's free , please . Mrs. Warder . She hangs up the receiver and writes . " I am leaving now . You will at least believe that I can not turn you out of your house , nor can I live in it one single day without you . It is ready waiting for you as I shall be all the rest of my life if you can ever again believe  --  " She stops as the SERVANT enters and comes to her. p. 100 SERVANT Madam ? BECKY finishes writing silently . BECKY sealing the note . Has Mr. Warder gone yet ? SERVANT Only just this second went out , madam . He told me to pack his bag and meet him at the station with it . BECKY rising . Give this to Mr. Warder with his things . Gives the note . SERVANT Yes , madam . He goes out left . The telephone bell rings . BECKY Goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again she does her best to keep the emotion out of her voice , but only partly succeeds . Hello ! Laura ? I 'm so sorry , after all , I ca n't see you to-night . Tom has been called to  --  Chicago suddenly on business  --  yes , is n't it too bad ? And I 've had a telegram that father is n't very well , so I am taking the five-twenty train for Baltimore . Yes , I 'll write . No , I do n't think he 's seriously ill . Good-bye ! She hangs up the receiver , dropping her head on the table and sobbing heart-brokenly as the curtain falls. @x The same night . MR . ROLAND 'S rooms in MRS . CRESPIGNY 'S flat in Baltimore . This is the parlor of a cheap flat , with the bedroom , through an arch , originally intended for the dining-room and lit by a narrow window on a well . There is red paper on the walls and red globes for the electric lights . An ugly set of furniture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " knick-knacks , " relieved by a sporting print or two , a frame of prize ribbons , and a few other masculine belongings which have been added to the original condition of the room , like a thin coat of paint . At back is a bow-window beside a sofa . On the left is the opening into the bedroom , and beside this a door leads to the hall . There is a center-table with chairs on either side and a Morris chair down on the right . A side-board in the upper left corner . ROLAND and MRS . CRESPIGNY are playing piquet at the center-table . A " Teddy-Bear " with a pink ribbon bow about its neck is sitting on the table near MRS . CRESPIGNY . They play on through part of the scene . ROLAND stops to light a cigarette , and MRS . CRESPIGNY takes advantage of the pause to powder her face and preen herself in a pocket mirror . CRESPIGNY You do n't think you smoke too many of them ? p. 102 ROLAND If my smoking is disagreeable to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRESPIGNY You know different ! You ca n't make that an excuse for skinning out of spending your evenings at home . I only wish't I smoked ' em myself . I 've read in the papers that real ladies do now  --  but I guess it 's the fast set , and I always was conservative . ROLAND playing . Do n't talk ; study your cards . If you do n't take care , you 'll win ! CRESPIGNY Will I ? Excuse me , I was n't thinking . She plays a card , and as ROLANDS takes the trick she takes up her mirror and examines wrinkles . I believe I 'll have massage . I heard of a fine massoor yesterday . ROLAND Masseuse , you mean , I hope . CRESPIGNY Massoor ! Massoose is plural . The singular is massoor . You forget I was educated in New Orleans . She rises and goes to the sideboard and pours out a brandy and soda . ROLAND Where 's my brandy and soda ? CRESPIGNY I 'm getting it . Bringing the glass down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you , Mrs. Crespigny. p. 103 CRESPIGNY Ai n't it funny , good friends as we 've been for so long now , we 've kep ' on calling each other " Mr. " and Mrs. " ? S'pose it would n't be etiquay to call each other by our first names . ROLAND Etiquette . CRESPIGNY Etiquay ! You can correct my English when you want to , but my French I 've kep ' pure since school , and I remember perfectly  --  all words ending in e-t you pernounce A. ROLAND What is your first name ? CRESPIGNY Genevieve , but I was always called Jenny by my first h  --  ! I mean  --  I was always called Jenny by my schoolgirl friends . ROLAND playing.Very interesting . CRESPIGNY playing.I think your first name 's real pretty ! ROLAND taking the trick.Tut , tut ! You 're getting too skittish , Mrs. Crespigny . She laughs a little embarrassedly . CRESPIGNY It 's your fault ! ROLAND playing card , and laughing.Then I apologize ! CRESPIGNY playing card , and giggling.Oh , you need n't ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but realizing that she will not know the difference.I insist . He takes the trick . CRESPIGNY Anybody 'd think we was engaged to be married or something of that sort , would n't they ? ROLAND I hope not ! CRESPIGNY Oh , I do n't know ! I remember some postal cards what I 've read that might be construed to lean that way . ROLAND rises and gets a cigarette from the box on the table in the bow-window . There was one from Atlantic City that was just too sweet for anything ! You sent it after we had that ridickerlous quarrel on the Board Walk . ROLAND What about ? CRESPIGNY I lost my self-respect and asked you to kiss me , ' cause you said you was grateful for the fifty dollars I gave you for your poker losses the night before . And you handed me back my money and said if that was the price of the loan  --  oh , how you hurt my feelings ! With a touch of futile emotion . ROLAND coming back to his chair.That was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game for the whole bunch of postal cards . Takes up the second deck and shuffles. p. 105 CRESPIGNY rising , speaks rather grandly.Nobody wo n't never get them postal cards from me except over my dead body . Cuts the cards , and ROLAND deals . And I intend to refer to ' em every chance I get in hopes that some day  --  just in a desperate fit , maybe  --  you 'll up and marry me to stop me . Sits again . ROLAND Go on , play . CRESPIGNY You 've owned up you 're comfortable in my cute little flat  --  and I do n't nag . Both take up their hands , both play , and she takes trick . ROLAND You have n't the right , but as my wife  --  nay , nay , Pauline . CRESPIGNY You 've got the best rooms here , and if you ever do pay any board , do n't I lend it right back to you the next day ? ROLAND is n't it a little indelicate to remind me of that , Mrs. Crespigny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess the indelicacy 's even ! She plays and starts to take the trick . He stops her and takes it himself . Oh , excuse me , I 'm at your beck and nod , and I 've even so far forgot my family pride as to hint that you was n't unacceptable to me in a nearer relation . p. 106 ROLAND There you go again ! Keep off the thin ice ! CRESPIGNY Throws down her cards and loses her temper outright . Well , why wo n't you marry me ? I may have forgot my pride , but I never forget myself . You know you would n't dare step over the invisible line between the dumb-waiter and the bathroom , what separates your apartment from mine in the flat . ROLAND One moment , please . Have I ever even hinted at taking the slightest advantage of your unprotected position in this house ? He rises in mock dignity . Who 's kept further from that invisible line , you or I ? CRESPIGNY Well , I must say you 've always behaved toward me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another cigarette . But jes ' let 's speak the truth  --  if you can about anything ! He fumbles in his vest pockets . Matches ? She rises , goes to the sideboard , and finding a box of matches , brings it back to the table During the first part of the following speech she makes nervous and ineffectual efforts to strike matches , in each case breaking off the heads without any result . You know you ai n't wanted at your clubs ; that 's why you first took to playin ' evenings with me  --  that , and ' cause I was easy ! You know that here in Baltimore you 're called a tout , a broken-down gambler , and a has-been , but I 've always hoped you was a will-be for me . Irritated by her repeated failures , he takes the match-box from her and lights his cigarette with the first match he strikes . You know your old friends 'd rather go ' round the block than stop and talk to you in the street . Yes , you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off me , borrowed money of me , led me to caring for you , let me take care of you as if you was  --  my own child , and I 've saved you from bein ' a drunken sot ! Her voice fills with tears , but her anger gets the best of her , and she finishes strongly , striking the table with her beringed hand as she leans across toward him . Now , why ai n't I good enough for you ? p. 107 ROLAND rising , really angry , and his dignity offended.Mrs . Crespigny  --  CRESPIGNY Oh , you need n't get on your high horse or I 'll win this rubber for the five hundred ! I know you 're worthless , and I know you do n't always tell the truth , but through it all you 've been a real gentleman to me , and I realized yesterday , when I thought you was gone for good , what it meant to me . I 'm a decent woman , Mr. Roland , if I am a fool , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as that goes , you 're too good for me , but I 've got others to consider . My daughter  --  CRESPIGNY interrupting him.Yes , I know she 's against me . She sits again , and with determination . Well , I ' m against her , and perhaps some day I 'll have a chance to pay her back ! ROLAND That 's talking foolishly ! In the first place , my allowance would stop the day I married . CRESPIGNY Well , have n't I got enough for two ? It 's looked mighty like it the last couple a years . She nervously takes the " Teddy Bear " from the table to hide her embarrassment at her boldness , and laying it flat on her knee , face downward , reties the pink bow on its neck. p. 108 ROLAND sitting , he gathers the cards together and shuffles them.Come , come , here we are again on one of those useless discussions . Come along , give me another brandy and soda . CRESPIGNY resignedly.All right . Rises , and takes his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will be your second before twelve o'clock and it 's got to be a little weakish . She goes to the sideboard . The front doorbell is heard ring . My goodness ! who can that be ? The bell rings again . ROLAND Do n't know , old girl , but go on , I 'll deal for you . He deals . CRESPIGNY going to the table , cuts the cards.I just love to have you call me " old girl "  --  it seems so nice and familiar . The bell rings again , and MRS . CRESPIGNY , taking the " Teddy Bear " with her , places it on the side table at left and goes out . ROLAND deals . After a moment 's pause BECKY comes in , carrying a handbag . She enters with an air of bravado , which fades instantly when she observes ROLAND does not see her . But her pathetic , timid look vanishes immediately when he looks up. p. 109 ROLAND going on dealing , without looking up.Who was it ? BECKY with forced gayety.Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table at left.are n't you surprised ? ROLAND dryly.Very . BECKY And pleased ? ROLAND Where in the world did you come from ? BECKY New York ; the next train after you . Give me a kiss . How are you ? Kisses him . ROLAND What have you come for ? Where are you stopping ? BECKY Here ! ROLAND At what hotel ? BECKY No hotel  --  here with you ! ROLAND Nonsense ! There 's no place for you in the flat . BECKY Why not ? I gave my check to the expressman and my trunk will be around in the morning . ROLAND These two rooms are all I have . Showing the opening to the left . Take a look at the bedroom  --  a beastly , dark little hole with one window that does n't look out  --  it looks in ! The bedroom of the flat we use for a dining-room . Mrs. Crespigny sleeps in the servant 's room  --  so she tells me. p. 110 BECKY Father ! ROLAND Now you can see what nice sort of surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these last years . BECKY Takes off her hat and cloak and puts them on sofa at right . You have only yourself to blame ! You could live splendidly on the allowance Tom makes you in the one club you ' ve got left . ROLAND You need n't take off your things ; you ca n't stay here . BECKY Oh , ca n't I ? I 've come to pay you a little visit , and here I stay to-night and several nights . Comes to the center-table and starts to collect cards . ROLAND Be careful ! That 's Genevieve 's hand and we must finish this some time  --  I 'm well ahead . Carefully places the cards , properly divided , on the table at left . And really , Becky , you ca n't stay here . You can go to a hotel if you want to , or back to New York . You 're in the way here ! I 'm an old man ; this sort of thing upsets me ! There 's no room and there ' s no bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What the devil do you mean , turning up here well toward midnight , and threatening to stay , when for years I 've been trying to get you to come to Baltimore , and you know you were ashamed to come ? p. 111 BECKY sitting in the chair left of the center-table.That is n't true , father ; I always said I 'd come if you 'd give up certain things . ROLAND Well , I have n't given them up , so why have you come ? What 's the joke ? And where 's Tom ? BECKY after a second 's pause.That 's just it . Tom has been called to  --  San Francisco  --  suddenly  --  just after you left , on business  --  and the idea came to me , at last I 'll make that visit to father ! It 'll be a good chance for me to settle Mrs. Crespigny , too ! ROLAND You could n't have come at a more inopportune time ! I was very busy this evening . BECKY Yes , I know  --  piquet with Mrs. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to get the cards . ROLAND No , you wo n't ! You 'll go to a hotel for the night and I 'll come and have a decent lunch with you to-morrow . BECKY I ca n't go to a hotel . I 've come away without a penny . I had to borrow half the money for my ticket from Perkins . ROLAND Where is Perkins ? BECKY In New York . I knew , of course , there 'd be no place for her here . p. 112 ROLAND Any of the hotel people here will trust you . BECKY I wo n't ask them . I forgot to get Tom 's address , so I ca n't send to him for any money . I 've got to stay with you , father . She sits on the arm of the Morris chair and puts her arm about her father . ROLAND You 're a very boring person ! BECKY That 's a kind welcome for a dear and only daughter ! ROLAND And I 'm not going to have myself made uncomfortable by you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe a little longer or maybe not so long . I 'll promise not to be any trouble ; I 'll sleep on the sofa ! ROLAND Humph ! You do n't know that sofa ! That was made in the antebellum and the antespringum days ! Even a cat could n't sleep on it without chloroform . BECKY Well , I do n't expect to sleep , father , and if I do n't , you wo n't know it . I 've got to stay . Rises and goes away and stands by the table with her back toward him . ROLAND Looks at her , suddenly suspicious . Becky , you 're not telling me the truth . Something 's the matter . p. 113 BECKY turning toward him , taking a high moral stand.Really , father ! ROLAND There 's something wrong . What is it ? BECKY Nothing . ROLAND Oh , come , I 'm your father , and I know the look in your eyes when you 're not telling the truth ; you get that look from me ! You 're telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it mean ? BECKY after a second 's pause , bursts out with all her pent-up feelings , which she has been trying to hide.I 've left Tom . ROLAND How do you mean  --  " Left Tom " ? BECKY Left him for good . I 'll never live with him again . ROLAND Nonsense BECKY Never ! You do n't understand . She sits again beside the table , leaning her elbows upon it and resting her face between her two hands . ROLAND No , I do n't ! and I do n't want to ! BECKY I 've left his house in New York for good . ROLAND What 's your reason ? What 's he done ? BECKY He 's deceived me. p. 114 ROLAND rising.Tom ! Never ! BECKY Father , I ca n't go back to him ; I ca n't ! Do n't ask me any more questions , only keep me with you  --  please , keep me with you . ROLAND going to her.You 're upset about matters . You 've had a quarrel , that 's all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've told him I 'll never come back and I 've come to stay  --  with you . ROLAND But I wo n't have it ! In the first place , Mrs. Crespigny would n't have it either . She 'd be jealous of your being here  --  and after all it 's her flat . And I do n't believe what you tell me about Tom . BECKY We can go somewhere else . Who is Mrs. Crespigny ? Rises , and going to him takes hold of his sleeve . And I 'm your daughter . Besides , Tom 's allowance will stop . From now on you and I must get on together with the little money I have from mother . ROLAND Nothing of the sort . Even if you did leave Tom , you can make him take care of you . BECKY I wo n't take any money from Tom ! No more money ! Do you hear me , father ? ROLAND becoming more angry.No , I do n't hear you ! And I have something to say about my end of all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your husband before it 's too late for him to take you back , and give him a chance to explain ! You 'll go back to Tom to-night ! He goes determinedly to the sofa and gets her hat and cloak for her. p. 115 BECKY Takes her hat from him and puts it on the center-table with equal determination . I shall sleep here , in this room , to-night ! ROLAND You 'll sleep in a Pullman car and wake up to-morrow , happy and in your right senses , in Jersey City . BECKY Moves back from him a little . You ca n't turn me out ! A pause . ROLAND reads the real trouble in her face and becomes serious and sympathetic . ROLAND Becky , you do n't really believe what you say about Tom ? She lowers her head in assent . You know ? She lowers her head again . There must be a mistake somewhere ! Puts the cloak on the Morris chair . If I ever knew a man who loved his wife ! Go back , Becky ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you with years of bitter experience behind me , and it 's only what good there is left in me that is urging me to say this to you . I know in the end that you 'll be nearer happiness than you ever can be any other way . Go back to Tom . BECKY No , no , I tell you , father , I 've left Tom for good ! Keep me with you  --  A knock on the door. p. 116 ROLAND Come in ! MRS . CRESPIGNY comes in left and BECKY sinks down into the Morris chair . CRESPIGNY worried.It 's getting pretty late ! I did n't know as Mis ' Warder knew the street car do n't run past here after twelve-thirty . ROLAND That 's all right . Mrs. Warder is taking the one o'clock train to New York . We 'll catch the last car . CRESPIGNY relieved , smiles.Oh , well , then , you 've got plenty of time . I 'd better let you have my latchkey , though . I 'll leave it on the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A glass of raspberry vinegar and a piece of jell cake ? BECKY No , thanks . CRESPIGNY offended.Good-evening . BECKY Good-evening . MRS . CRESPIGNY goes out . Why did you say I was going ? I 'm not ! ROLAND You are . If you love Tom , you 'll go . He goes to her and puts his arm around her shoulder . Do you love Tom still ? BECKY Yes , father . ROLAND Then go back , Becky ! p. 117 BECKY No . ROLAND Your religion teaches you that the greatest love always carries with it the power of forgiveness . BECKY eagerly.Oh , it 's what I want to believe . If it 's only true  --  if it 's only true of us ! ROLAND You 've got to make it true by going back ! He moves away . Good God ! you sha n't repeat your mother 's and my mistake and make a miserable failure of both your lives ! BECKY looks up surprised . BECKY What mistake ? ROLAND quietly , ashamed.Your mother left me , just as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left you ? ROLAND And for the same reason , do you understand me  --  that you want to leave Tom . BECKY But you never told me ! ROLAND No . BECKY How long before she died ? ROLAND A year . BECKY And how long were you and mother happy together ? p. 118 ROLAND A few months  --  not many . BECKY Tom and I have been blissfully happy for six years ! ROLAND That 's an argument for me ! Go back ! BECKY What a lot of lies you 've always told me about yourself and mother  --  all my life ! You always said you were an ideal couple and that it was sorrow over her death that made you what you are ! ROLAND I was ashamed when you found me out  --  I wanted some excuse to try and keep your sympathy and affection . Besides , what good would it have done to have told you the truth ? He crosses to the table left , and taking up a photograph of his wife , stands looking at it . BECKY If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it would have saved me this night . I 've about decided that the truth in everything is the best for everything in the end  --  if one could only learn to tell it . ROLAND You must begin young and you did n't . BECKY By whose fault ? ROLAND turns away from her , feeling the sting . Tell me now about you and mother . She sits again in the Morris chair. p. 119 ROLAND by the center-table.Well , your mother accused me as you do Tom . But it was n't true of me , Becky ! it was n't true  --  then . BECKY I 'm afraid I do n't believe you , father . ROLAND You do n't believe me when , even now , after all these years , I tell you it was n't true ? BECKY No . I want to believe you , father , but I ca n't ! You 've just admitted you 've lied to me all my life about you and mother ! Why should I believe you would suddenly turn around and tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in you like your mother ! Do all that I could , swear by everything she or I held holy , I could n't persuade her I was telling the truth ! BECKY Perhaps you had already destroyed her confidence in you ! You can do that , even with some one who loves you , in a day , in an hour , in even less ! ROLAND It did look ugly against me , and your mother was already disappointed in me . I could n't live up to her standard . He smiles . I was sort of good-looking , when she married me ,  --  too foppish , perhaps ,  --  and I rode my own horses , generally to win , too ,  --  and what part of my income I did n't make on the race-track I made with the ace and right bower ! I promised your mother to give up the gambling side of it  --  but I could n't ; it was in my blood ; I tried , Becky , but I failed . I lied to her about it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a crank on the subject of lying , anyway . One of those straightforward , narrow-minded , New England women who think everything that is n't the truth is a lie ! I always hated the plain truth . I liked to trim it up a little . p. 120 BECKY with a nervous , pathetic little laugh.Like me ! ROLAND Yes . I remember how we used to laugh at you as a child ! Almost the first words you spoke were fibs , and gad , the fairy stories you used to tell about yourself ! Goes up to table . BECKY Yes . Do you remember the time , father , after I 'd been reading Grimm 's fairy tales about the wicked step-parents , how I told all over Baltimore you were my stepfather and beat me ? It made me a real heroine , to the other children , and I loved it ! And you found it out , and gave me my choice of being punished or promising never to tell another story ! Do you remember ? ROLAND Sits on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could never bear to punish you ! BECKY I always made up stories about everything . I did n't see any harm  --  then  --  ROLAND Well , your mother said I 'd proved I could n't tell the truth ! She did n't often use plain and ugly words , but she called me a liar , and I 've never heard the word since without hearing her voice and seeing her face as she said it ! BECKY You loved her ! Oh , I know how it must have hurt ! p. 121 ROLAND She would n't believe me , she would n't forgive , and she left me ! I do n't blame her ; it was my own fault at bottom ! But it 's true as land and water , Becky , as true as you 're my daughter , God help you , and that I 've loved you in my useless , selfish old way , I was true to your mother . I loved her , and no other woman existed for me then . I was willing to own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I was willing to own up I was a liar , even , and perhaps I deserved all I got , but I loved your mother , and when she went back on me and believed the one thing about me that was n't true , I gritted my teeth like a damn fool and said , " To hell with women and to the dogs for me ! " BECKY And it was n't true ! Father ! I believe you , it was n't true ! ROLAND No ; but it was true enough soon after ! I kept my word to myself and gave her plenty of reasons not to love me afterwards  --  and that was the beginning of the end of me . BECKY But if you 'd only waited , if you 'd only given her a chance , would n't she have realized ? ROLAND going to her , puts his hand on her shoulder.Yes , and that 's why you must go back to Tom to-night . Do you want to repeat your mother 's and my story ? Go back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell you what Tom 'll do if you put off going back to him till it 's too late . He 'll let you go , and help you to divorce him , so he can marry some other woman , your opposite , and be happy the rest of his life . BECKY Father ! BECKY shows a new element , jealousy , added to her trouble . ROLAND Or else he 'll grow hard and bitter about all women , and the gold years of a man 's life will be brass in his mouth  --  thanks to you ! BECKY Yes , and I 'll live here with you and grow dowdy and slattern , till I 'm slovenly all through  --  body and soul ! I wo n't care how I look or what company I keep in place of the friends who will surely drop me . I 'll take up your life here , and my face 'll grow flabby and my heart dry and my spirit fogged , and I 'll have nobody to thank for the dead end but myself ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to go back to Tom to-night ! You were happy enough with him this afternoon ! He 's been a wonderful husband to you and I know the run of them ! I do n't blame him for not wanting me around  --  a father-in-law who was a disgrace to his wife . He did right to keep me here where I 'm an old story and nobody cares . I 'll own up to this now that you want to turn your back on him . But you sha n't do it ! You sha n't break up his home with a beastly scandal and spoil your whole life and perhaps his , all in one hysterical hour ! Listen ! He goes to her and places his two hands on her shoulders . It 's true that no one was to blame for what I 've sunk to but myself . Still , it 's also true that in the beginning , perhaps , a great deal of patience , and more forgiveness , might have made both your mother 's life and mine a little more worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of an almost forgotten emotion. p. 123 BECKY You do n't dream how every word you say cuts and saws into me ! But I ca n't go back ! ROLAND You will . For if it comes down to this point , I wo n't keep you here ! BECKY But I ca n't go to a hotel . I have n't any money . ROLAND I have enough for your ticket , and I 'll take you to the station and send a telegram to Tom to expect you in the morning . BECKY No , I ca n't  --  I ca n't . ROLAND sternly.You 've got to ! You ca n't stay here and I wo n't give you a cent to stay anywhere else ! BECKY You would n't turn me out into the streets ! ROLAND Yes . I will , if I must to force you to go back to your husband . He gets her cloak . BECKY Rises , desperate . Father ! ROLAND struck by her tone , pauses.Well ? BECKY Drops her head and with a great effort speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't left Tom  --  it 's Tom 's left me  --  A pause . ROLAND stands looking at her and her cloak drops from his hand , as he slowly takes in what she means. p. 124 ROLAND What do you say ? BECKY Tom has left me  --  now you know why I ca n't go back . ROLAND What for ? BECKY He called me what mother called you . He 's lost confidence in me . He believes  --  there 's some one else . The last in agony of shame and grief . ROLAND No wonder you made me worm out the truth ! I would n't have believed it of you , Becky ! I would n't have believed it of you ! BECKY frightened.But it is n't true , father ! ROLAND Why did n't you tell me the right story in the beginning ? BECKY aghast.Father ! Do n't you believe me ? ROLAND You denied it to him , I suppose ? BECKY Of course . ROLAND And he turned you out all the same ? BECKY He did n't turn me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . I came away ! ROLAND Well , if your husband does n't believe in you , how can you expect me to , who ' ve known all your life you could n't tell the truth ? p. 125 BECKY Father , I 've told you the truth now ! For God 's sake , believe me , for if you wo n't believe me either , what will become of me ? ROLAND I can help you better if you 'll be honest with me . A man like Tom Warder is n't putting the wife he 's been a slave to out of his life without good reason . He turns away from her . BECKY You said you knew the look in my face when I lied , because it was your look . Goes to him and stands close , facing him . Look in my face now and tell me what you see there . She speaks very simply and clearly . I love Tom and only Tom and never have loved any other man and have never been anything but faithful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking into her face , still unconvinced . I stand with Tom exactly , father , where you stood the day mother left you  --  His face begins to change . A knock on the door left . CRESPIGNY outside.If Mis ' Warder wants to catch that train , I hear the car coming ! BECKY breathlessly seizing hold of him with her two hands.Father ! ROLAND Mrs. Warder 's changed her mind . She 's stopping here to-night . Putting his arms about her. p. 126 BECKY Father ! Her tension gives way , and she lies limp in his arms , her slender body shaking with the emotion which now masters her as the curtain falls. @x MR . ROLAND 'S rooms in MRS . CRESPIGNY 'S flat , the following Monday . The sun pours in through the bow-window ; folded bedclothes and a pillow are placed neatly on one end of the sofa . BECKY and ROLAND are having coffee together at the center-table . The cloth is soiled , other things in the room are in disorder , and everything is decidedly unappetizing . ROLAND is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee-pot before him . BECKY How horrid and messy everything is ! ROLAND who is smoking a cigarette as he eats.Oh , you 'll get used to it . Before you know it you 'll like things best this way . BECKY Not if I can help it . I shall fight against it . ROLAND You think so now ; you 've only had one day at it . BECKY To begin with , my dear father , you must n't come to breakfast with me in that disgusting bathrobe . ROLAND If you imagine for a minute I 'm going to let you come here and upset everything to rob me of my comfort , you 'll have your hands full . MRS . CRESPIGNY is heard playing a piano in a farther room through most of the scene . Her repertoire is varied , and consists of an old waltz , a coon song , the " Melody in F , " and " Waiting at the Church . " p. 128 BECKY with an effort at a smile.It will be another fight then , father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm stronger by six years ' life with a splendid character , which will help me bring you and myself up to Tom 's level , rather than go down with you to this . ROLAND to change the subject.Have you written Tom ? BECKY sighing.A hundred letters , I should think . ROLAND And no answer ? BECKY No , there is n't time . ROLAND Yes , he could telegraph . BECKY But I did n't send any of the letters . ROLAND looking up from his newspaper.You are n't eating anything . BECKY rising in disgust , goes and sits in Morris chair.Father , we ca n't live here , can we ? You must tell Mrs. Crespigny , and I 'll find a little flat , just for us two  --  ROLAND irritably.I knew it would come to that ! Not satisfied with upsetting Warder 's existence and your own , you 've got to come here and upset mine ! No , sir ! I 'll marry Mrs. C. before I 'll leave here . p. 129 BECKY That 's a threat I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long nights to think things over . I wish I could die , but I know one ca n't die when one wants to . I know sorrow , however heart-breaking , does n't kill ,  --  and I 'm so horribly healthy I 'll probably live forever . I may even have to stand aside and see Tom happy with some one else . Well , all the same I mean to live exactly as I would if I were still with Tom . I 'm going to live as if every day , every hour , I was expecting him back . I 'm going to live so that if he ever should come back to me  --  I will be ready to go home with him . The music stops for a moment ROLAND That 's all very well for you , but I do n't see why I should have to live a life to please Tom  --  just so you can leave me in the lurch when he comes back after you . The odds are pretty strong against his wanting me to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his rules , and I do n't intend to begin now . Goes to far table in the bow-window and takes a fresh cigarette and changes his paper for another . BECKY rising , takes the bedclothes from the sofa.Do n't forget , father , what little money we have is mine , so you 'll have to live as I wish . And in the end I believe you 'll thank me . She goes into the bedroom. p. 130 ROLAND But in the beginning I 'll damn you , and in the end , too ! I 'm too old a leopard to change my spots . He makes himself comfortable in the Morris chair . BECKY coming out of the bedroom.I 'm going to try just as hard as I can not to tell even little lies , no matter how small , just to see if I ca n't get into the habit of always telling the truth . Because he might come back , father , do n't you think so ? Do n't you think maybe he 'll come back ? ROLAND I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager.How ? ROLAND Never mind how . I 'll tell you if it works . BECKY piling the breakfast dishes on the tray.I hoped he 'd answer the note I sent by Jenks , but he did n't . No ; when Tom says a thing , he means it . I 'm going out for a little while . She places the tray on the table left . ROLAND Where ? BECKY There 's a small empty flat two doors below here ; I 'm going to look it over . I think it may do for us . She goes into the bedroom. p. 131 ROLAND Do n't be gone long , because I might need you . BECKY in the bedroom.For what ? ROLAND To help receive Tom ! BECKY coming out quickly.Father ! ROLAND Do n't get your expectations too high , but I telegraphed him yesterday to come here . The piano is heard again , but stops during BECKY 'S long speech . BECKY If he would n't come for me , he would n't come because you asked him . ROLAND I feel if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becky , especially now when he 's had time to think things over , to realize calmly , away from the heat of anger , that whatever your faults might be  --  BECKY Interrupts eagerly , going toward him . Yes , yes  --  ROLAND Lack of love for him and faithlessness could n't be among them . BECKY Yes , if I could see him ! She kneels on the floor beside him , her arms on the arm of the chair . I feel that if there 's left in the bottom of his heart  --  no matter how deep down  --  just a little love for me , if it 's only the memory of what he once had , would n't my own love be some sort of a magnet to bring his back ? If I could sit and talk to him , hold his hand , go back over our life a little , could n't I make him see that I loved him  --  and only him , that what I 'd done had been foolish  --  wrong not to do as he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned something by this terrible lesson ? And if I promised to try with all my might and main not to lie any more , if I promised I would n't be discouraged with failure if he would n't be , but would keep on trying , would n't he on his side try to have a little confidence again ? Would n't he let me come back into his life just for that trial anyway ? p. 132 ROLAND I think so . A man like Warder ca n't get over loving a woman all in a moment , especially if he finds out before it 's too late he 's misjudged her . Wrong as you may have been , we know you 're not so wrong as he thinks . BECKY But he wo n't come . You see you have n't heard from him  --  he wo n't come . She goes up to the bow-window and looks out . ROLAND I 'm a little worried myself . I told him to telegraph and said it was urgent . BECKY How  --  urgent ? ROLAND Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply said , " Come and see Becky , " of course he would n't have paid any attention . I had to make the telegram so he would come . BECKY Yes , but how did you ? ROLAND It was a stroke of genius ! I said , " Becky is dying . Come at once ! " BECKY going to the sofa and sitting on it.But I 'm not dying . He 'll find out as soon as he gets here . ROLAND No , he must n't . My idea was that he would think you had tried to kill yourself  --  do n't you see ? It would rouse his sympathies  --  perhaps some remorse  --  and he would hurry on . Dropping the paper carelessly on the floor , he rises. p. 133 BECKY But he has n't ! ROLAND He could n't get here till this morning ; still , I ought to have had an answer to the telegram . He goes into the bedroom . BECKY Rises and goes toward the opening . And if he should come ? ROLAND coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must be careful , not to give me away till you are solid with him again . You must be weak and ill  --  just getting over it  --  the doctor 's saved you ! Anyway , I thought that might bring him . BECKY I do n't like it . ROLAND going back into the bedroom offended.I did my best ! BECKY But it seems to me as if I would be telling Tom a lie again . ROLAND Not at all . I 'm telling it . And besides , does n't the end justify the means ? BECKY I think Tom 'd call it a lie . I do n't want to do it ! ROLAND Well , if he comes in answer to my telegram , you 've got to do it ! BECKY No , father , I wo n't ! p. 134 ROLAND Nonsense ! You ca n't get out of it . And , good Heavens , why should you , if it 's going to give you back what you want and prevent a terrible upheaval ? The piano is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered , so perhaps he wo n't come . I 'm going out . Gets her hat from table left . ROLAND Do n't be long in any case . He might have forgot to send word , or not have time , or even have suspected something and not answered purposely , and be coming all the same on this morning 's train ! BECKY putting on her hat.I 'll see the flat and come straight back . She starts to go , stops and turns in the doorway . Thank you , father , for trying to help me . If he only will come ! She goes out left . ROLAND lighting another cigarette.Move into another flat ! To live with everything so filthy clean you ca n't be easy and let things go ! Ta , ta to the bucket-shop , and never a cent to put on anything again ! Nothing but cleanth and economy ! No , no , Stepheu Roland , not at your age . He stands gazing at a portrait of MRS . CRESPIGNY on the right wall , with a half-humorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left wall . Listen , do n't you hear wedding bells ? He rings the bell . Do you hear them , Stephen ! He rings again . The piano off stage stops . Wedding bells ! He turns and walks toward the portrait again , nodding his head definitely . A knock on the door left . Come in  --  Jennie ! MRS . CRESPIGNY comes in. p. 135 CRESPIGNY Did you ring ? ROLAND I believe I did . CRESPIGNY What 's the matter ? My piano-playing disturb Mis ' Warder ? ROLAND Oh  --  is the pianola mended ? CRESPIGNY Yes . The man said I worked the pedals too emotionally . ROLAND I wanted to see you . CRESPIGNY pulling her belt down and her marcel wave out.Well , I 'm visible ! ROLAND Mrs. Crespigny , I 'm in trouble . CRESPIGNY going to him.Now , look here , Mr. Roland , true as Gospel I ca n't let you have another cent , not before the first of the month . Your daughter 's here now ; you 've got to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't money . At least that is n't this moment 's trouble . My daughter and her husband have quarreled . CRESPIGNY I suspected something was wrong . She starts , aghast and angry at a new idea which comes to her . She do n't mean to come here and live ? ROLAND No , she wants to take me away to live with her . p. 136 CRESPIGNY did n't I always tell you she 'd separate us if she could ! Now show your character ! I guess you 're your own boss , ai n't you ? You wo n't go , Mr. Roland ? ROLAND But you see if they do n't make up their quarrel , my allowance stops and I wo n't have a cent . I 'll have to live where my daughter wants me . CRESPIGNY taking from the bosom of her shirt-waist a second-hand natural rose with a wired stem and destitute of green leaves , she twists the wired part nervously about.Why ai n't one woman 's money just as good as another 's for you to live on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point , and you 've come pretty bluntly , but that 's just as well in view of the poor figure I cut in the matter . He turns up toward the center-table and places on it his newspaper , which he has picked up from the floor . CRESPIGNY Why , I think , considering your age , your figger 's great ! ROLAND looking at her despairingly.I spoke figuratively ! Now I 'm doing my best to bring about a reconciliation . Of course , if I succeed , I can keep on living here just as usual  --  I 'll have my allowance . CRESPIGNY But if you do n't bring about the reconciliation ? p. 137 ROLAND Well , in that case , frankly , I should have to leave you or marry you ! CRESPIGNY going to the table.Look here , Mr. Roland , I want this in black and white ! Are you proposing to me ? ROLAND Well , Mrs. Crespigny , in a way  --  CRESPIGNY But there 's a string to it ? ROLAND You know you have once or twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , but it 's a poor bargain for you , and in case the proposal should ever be definitely made , I want to be sure you know what you 're getting ! CRESPIGNY I guess I know well enough . I ai n't lived in the same flat with you for four solid years without finding out whether or not you was worth it to me . I know your faults , Mr. Roland , but they 're swell faults . ROLAND He goes to the table in the window to get a cigarette . Mrs. Crespigny , suppose you keep to the point , which is , if I marry  --  if you marry me , you do it with your eyes open . I 'm to have all the liberty I 've ever had . None of my habits are to be interfered with , none of my ways of spending money . CRESPIGNY All right . I know I wo n't be marrying a hero , but I 'll be getting a high-toned name and the company I want for keeps , for if once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sneak you away from me , and you ca n't get nothing in this world for nothing . She sits right of the table with a lugubrious expression on her poor powdered face. p. 138 ROLAND Very well , then coming down to her , if there 's no reconciliation to-day , we 'll consider it settled without another word . CRESPIGNY And if she does make it up with her husband ? ROLAND We 'll let that stand for the present . I would still have my allowance and I would n't have to leave the flat . CRESPIGNY Then , so far as I 'm concerned ,  --  and I do n't make no bones about saying it ,  --  I ' d rather they kep ' separate . ROLAND Do n't be selfish ! I think you 'll win without that . He lifts her head tenderly , smiling sweetly ; then , as he turns away from her , the sweetness fades , and he looks at least twenty years older . MRS . CRESPIGNY , happy but embarrassed , tears the faded rose to pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to have had a telegram long ago ! CRESPIGNY Starts and rises . A telegram ! My stars ! This telegram came before you was up and I forgot all about it . Giving him a telegram . ROLAND That wo n't do ! You 'll have to be more thoughtful than that ! Reading the telegram . He 's coming ! He 's due here any minute ! And Beck out ! Quick ! help me make this look like a sick-room. p. 139 CRESPIGNY A sick-room ? ROLAND I 'll put this chair here for Becky to sit in ! Moving the Morris chair near to the table . CRESPIGNY And I 'll put a towel on the table . Getting one from the bedroom . But why a sick-room , Mr. Roland . Who 's sick ? ROLAND That 's how I got him here . Telegraphed Becky was dying  --  and it 's worked  --  he 's coming ! CRESPIGNY You ought to have some bottles for medicine ! ROLAND Bottles ? Here 's a couple ! Getting a whiskey bottle and a brandy bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want him to think she 's been on a spree , do you ? She puts them on the table left . Put a glass of water on the table . He gets a glass from the sideboard . And I 'll put this saucer and spoon on top  --  that 'll look like homoeopathic stuff . She places a saucer on the table and breathes on the spoon and polishes it on a corner of tablecloth . ROLAND gets a pillow and a blanket from the bedroom and arranges them in the Morris chair . Do you know what we ought to have on that table ? An orange on a plate ! I do n't know why it is , but it a ways looks like sick folks , having an orange on a plate by ' em ! Wait a minute . I 've got a marble orange just like real . I 'll get it . I 'll take the tray . MRS . CRESPIGNY with the tray at the door left . Josephine ! Josephine ! Oh , never mind if your hands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he places in front of the Morris chair . He pulls down the window shades , takes the siphon , and fills the glass on the table , putting the saucer and spoon on top of it . MRS . CRESPIGNY enters with an imitation orange on a plate . Here it is ! And I brought a knife with it  --  do n't it look natural ? The front bell rings. p. 140 ROLAND Becky ! CRESPIGNY No  --  I let her take the key ! ROLAND Maybe it 's he ! And Becky not back ! Do n't let Josephine open the door yet ! CRESPIGNY Opens the left door and calls . Josephine ! Josy ! I 'll tend door ; you go on with your washing ! She shuts the door . ROLAND Show him here  --  CRESPIGNY Huh , huh ? ROLAND And I 'll tell him the doctor 's with Becky  --  CRESPIGNY Huh , huh ? ROLAND Then you watch for her , and when she comes , knock on the door and tell me the doctor 's gone  --  CRESPIGNY doubtfully.Huh , huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she feels able to see him , " and bring her in as if from her bedroom . He goes to the Morris chair and arranges the pillow and blanket . CRESPIGNY It 's lucky I do n't have to tell him all that ! You know , I have n't got your  --  imagination ! ROLAND That 's all right  --  you 'll see ,  --  they 'll be reconciled ! Gets a fan from behind the book-rack on the back wall and puts it on the table. p. 141 CRESPIGNY Reconciled ! ROLAND Yes , yes , they 'll be reconciled ! CRESPIGNY Our marriage is as good as off , then ! ROLAND Yes , yes  --  I mean we 'll see ! The front bell rings again . Do n't keep him waiting  --  he might get suspicious ! CRESPIGNY turning the matter over in her mind , speaks very abstractedly.Our marriage is as good as off , then ! She goes out slowly , weighing this sudden complication in her affairs . ROLAND Well , you never know your luck ! No , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expecting him . CRESPIGNY off stage.How do you do ? Wo n't you come right in ? WARDER enters . ROLAND So you 've come , Tom ? TOM very serious.How is she , father ? ROLAND The doctor is with her now . Mrs. Crespigny will let me know when he 's gone . I have n't let her know I telegraphed you . TOM But will she get well ? Is she no worse ? p. 142 ROLAND We have every hope of her getting well . TOM He turns aside to control a sudden flood of emotion . Thank God ! ROLAND I think a good deal now depends upon you . WARDER faces ROLAND . Roland goes to him . Are you ready to take my daughter back ? TOM very quietly , soberly.Yes . ROLAND For good ? TOM If I can only feel sure Becky will try  --  only try  --  to be straightforward and honest with me , that 's all I ask . God knows what I 've suffered these two days , and when your message came  --  oh , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more than a man could bear ! ROLAND Whatever Becky 's faults may have been , you did her one terrible injustice ! TOM Yes , I know that now ! Becky  --  never ! Father , hour after hour since the one in which I left her , I 've paced up and down my room , or sat and gritted my teeth in the train , and thought  --  and thought  --  and thought  --  till the anger died out of me and I began to see things white and clear both ahead and behind me . And all the time Becky 's final words kept ringing in my ears , and they range true : " I love you , and only you , and you always . " And the further away from the excitement and anger I got , the saner I grew . And as I passed over our life together , second by second of happiness , I found only proof after proof of her love for me ! Yes , I did Becky one great injustice , and I want to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . Takes TOM 'S hand.Tom  --  TOM After all , life is made up of compromises and concessions , and if Becky will only try , and let me help her  --  ROLAND I believe you love her still ? TOM I can only answer you by saying that I want more than anything else in the world to believe in her again  --  to have at least the beginning of confidence . With a knock on the door , MRS . CRESPIGNY comes in , frightened at what she is going to do . ROLAND hesitates one moment , but his old habit soon reasserts itself . ROLAND The doctor gone ? MRS . CRESPIGNY nods her head . Excuse me . He hurries out left . MRS . CRESPIGNY stands looking after ROLAND , evidently trying to nerve herself up to the task of telling WARDER the truth . She makes several ineffectual gasping efforts to speak , and finally gets started , rushing her words and not daring to speak slowly for fear she 'd stop . CRESPIGNY I 'm going to do something awful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rest of my life . Lord knows , seems as if I 'd been punished enough in advance . Can I trust you ? p. 144 TOM In what way ? CRESPIGNY As a gentleman . If I tell you something  --  something that you ought to know  --  will you promise to see it through and not let on I told you ? TOM I do n't know if I can promise that . Is it anything you have a right to tell me ? CRESPIGNY going toward him.It wo n't do you no harm to pertect me , and I give you my sacred word of honor it 's the truth instead of the lie you 've been told ! And all I ask is that you 'll perfect me as regards Mr. Roland . TOM astounded , bewildered , but his suspicions rearoused.What lie ? Go on . I give you the promise ! CRESPIGNY Whispers . She ai n't sick ! TOM Who ? CRESPIGNY Mis ' Warder ! She ai n't been sick  --  that was all a story to get you here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them tight , so she ca n't get away from him.No ! Do n't say that ! CRESPIGNY Ssh ! I will say it ! It 's true ! The doctor was n't here when you came ! Mis ' Warder was out and only came in when I knocked on the door just now ! p. 145 TOM Do you realize what you 're saying ? CRESPIGNY Perfeckly ! TOM And you 're telling me the truth ? CRESPIGNY Keep your eyes open and judge for yourself , that 's all ! Maybe you think that 's the truth ! Snatching up the imitation orange from the table , she smashes it on the floor . WARDER moves to go ; she stands in front of the door to stop him . TOM Let me go ! I wo n't stay for this brutal farce ! CRESPIGNY You promised to perfect me , and if you go now Mr. Roland 'll catch on , and I want him to marry me ! Now you know  --  TOM Was this his idea or hers ? CRESPIGNY His , and she  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door.Ssh ! they 're here ! WARDER controls himself and goes to the other side of the room . ROLAND comes , bringing BECKY , who leans on him . Her eyes are down . WARDER stands immovable and watches. p. 146 ROLAND pointedly.Thank you , Mrs. Crespigny . She goes out unwillingly . BECKY looks up and sees WARDER . He stands motionless , watching her . BECKY as she meets WARDER 'S eyes , breaks away from ROLAND.No , father ! I ca n't do it ! I wo n't do it ! ROLAND frightened.Becky ! BECKY No ! I tell you it 's only another lie and a revolting one ! ROLAND You 're ill ! You do n't know what you 're saying ! BECKY No , I 'm not ill , and you know it , and I have n't been ! And if I ca n't win his love back by the truth , I 'll never be able to keep it , so what 's the use of getting it back at all ? The tears fill her eyes and her throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still holds himself back . His face shows his joy , but neither BECKY nor ROLAND see this . BECKY continuing after a moment , pathetically.I thought I might creep back , through pity , first into your life , and then into your heart again . But , after all , I ca n't do it . She sits in the Morris chair , hopelessly . Something 's happened to me in these two days  --  even if I tell lies , I 've learned to loathe them and be afraid of them , and all the rest of my life I 'll try  --  p. 147 TOM in a choked voice.Thank God ! He goes to her , almost in tears himself . ROLANDS looks at WARDER , and realizes what it means ; a smile comes over his own face , and at the same time his eyes fill with his almost-forgotten tears . BECKY You ca n't forgive me ! TOM We do n't love people because they are perfect . He takes her two trembling hands in his , and she rises . BECKY Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he takes her in his arms close to him , as the final curtain falls.
