WHEN I left the train at Ogden , the dawn had touched the mountain snow crests with a delicate rose pink . The valley was still dark ; those glowing summits hung like clouds in the sky . Then the pink turned to orange , the orange to chrome , the chrome to pale canary , and that to a crystalline white ; and it was day . " What a paradise ! " thought I. And with that I took up a morning paper , and read in the headlines , " Polygamy , " and other things not to be mentioned . Oh , it was saddening ! The beauty of Utah is tarnished , its alpine atmosphere tainted , its moral trend vile and low . And yet , aside from the curse of plural marriage , you have here the very pearl of the Rockies : a land rich in gold and silver and lead and gleaming precious stones ; marvelous in its resources for the breeding of horses and sheep ; fertile of soil and varied of cll mate , so that farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and almonds , figs , pomegranates , and cotton its another . Moreover , the Mormons have developed every source of industry that goes to the making of a commercially independent commonwealth . Unlike the other intermontane states , Utah possesses a complete social order , masses as well as classes , the foundations of a people as well as its proud superstructure . In the beginning of Mormonism , Brigham Young , that extraordinary character , ? for daring a Cromwell , for intrigue a Machiavelli , for executive force a Moses , and for the utter absence of conscience a Bonaparte , ? led up his people into the wilderness . It was a veritable pilgrimage , a soul-trying " move " across a trackless continent , harassed the while by savages . These wanderers trusted in Brigham Young as in their God . One hundred and forty-three persons , with seventy-two wagons , ninety- 262 The Mormons. three horses , fifty-two mules , sixty-six oxen , and nineteen cows , marched in the van . Two hundred Saints trod close in their rear . They traversed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at last looked down upon a treeless , yellow valley . " See ! " cried Brigham . " There is another Dead Sea , there another Lake of Gennesaret , and betwixt them another Jordan . This is the holy Canaan . Let us enter and possess the land . " Accordingly , the Mormons halted their train , and began to establish themselves for permanent abode , a thousand miles from the borders of civilization , in what was then Mexican territory . Their first task was the redeMption of the desert . Eager hands assailed the sagebrush , and brought down water in trenches from the mountains . The Mormons became the inventors of American irrigation . Lucern absorbed the alkali from the soil . Crops sprang up ; crickets attacked the crops ; and then , by a miracle , a vast flock of white sea gulls , never seen before on the lake , fell upon the crickets and devoured them all . The vale became fruitful , and soon turned a transcontinental halfway house , or caravansary , making possible the development of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beckoned all true believers . Some came by ship round the Horn ; some dragged handcarts over the prairies and mountain passes ; while immense wagon trains rumbled westward , a marvel to bison and marmot . By 1848 Brigham Young had two thousand subjects . They had named their country Deseret , " the home of the honey bee , " and they styled it " a free and independent state . " Then swiftly upgrew the Mormons ' intermontane principality . Farms dotted its valleys , tiny hamlets clustered amongst its gulches , roads led from village to village , and all roads led at last to the holy city where centred its theocratic government . And the capital city was Zion in truth , builded by Brigham Young " according to the pattern shown him in the mount . " It " lieth four-square . " In the midst of the city , within a vast inclosure girt by stout yellow ramparts , looms the House of the Lord , four gray walls and six gray towers , their slender spires half reminiscent of lovely Peterborough , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in deathless granite . Forty years was the temple in building . Beside the Temple crouches the Tabernacle , ? a squat brown turtle shell set hard upon countless red pillars . Near by is another in-closure , walled like the first and buttressed with cobblestones , where tithing is taken and coin counted out , and where , in the earlier day , Brigham Young made his home , and incidentally the home of his incalculable wives . There in the highway rises the tall plinth which supports the bronze statue of Brigham himself . To the four points of the compass run the stately broad streets of the Mormon capital , lined with superb shops , adobe cottages , and occasional really magnificent houses , and shaded by never ending rows of tall , shivering Lombardy poplars , " planted by rivers of water " drawn in little irrigation ditches from the melting snows of the mountains . And round about the city those naked crags leap into high heaven , ? blue in the crystalline lustre of the upper atmosphere , caressed by lagging cloud drifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain to the valley to brighten the purple asters . Such , in a word , is Salt Lake City , ? the city of uncrowned Cmsars and tiaraless popes , the Rome of a new and strange religion . Go upon the Sabbath to the Tabernacle service . Sit beneath that crude white vault , look about you upon twelve thousand Mormon devotees , listen to the grotesque elucidation of Brighamite doctrine , and you will feel as if you were living five hundred years ago . Ah , but the music ! ? you think of Il Penseroso : And that is just the devil of it ! The religious instinct is thus yoked with delusion , treason , and crime . No other instance of social transplantation and metamorphosis in America is in any way comparable with this Mormon migration . Yankee traits persist throughout Greater New England ; the sweep of the Pennsylvanian from state to state leaves the Pennsylvanian very little changed ; the Southern tide that rolls over lower Ohio , Illinois , and Indiana is salted with the flavor of the old Confederacy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ormons caught their dupe when they made him over completely , giving him a. degrading religion , a novel contentment with abridged liberty , and a perverted conscience which approved of plural marriage . Let me be understood . I am not attacking Mormonism because I think it a false creed . I do so think it , but I am attacking it because it stands for treason and crime sanctioned by fabricated " revelations . " The Mormon theocracy ? or " theodemocracy " ? is an utterly un-American conception . With the form of a republic , it is ideally an absolute monarchy ; feigning to rest upon the consent of the governed , it exalts its president to supreme power over all believers . Said Brigham Young , " I am God to them . " And as for polygamy , though only six per cent of the married men ever had plural families , the institution was sustained by the entire church , and is so sustained in principle to-day . Polygamy made Utah . Abnormally increasing its population , it became the basis of imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gladly admit , on the other hand , one splendid result of Mormonism . Along with its strong men , it has gathered many incompetent , many unfit , seine degenerate , from all countries , fired them with religious mania , attached that mania to temporal activities , and bred a spirit of tireless industry . Utah is therefore a social elevator . The penniless immigrant , ? where else is he half so sure of such helping hands ? A bishop allots him his acres , a bishop lends him his implements , a bishop talks wisely of seeds and of harvest . Presently , this serf , or pauper , or Georgia cracker has become self-supporting and prosperous . Nine tenths of the Latter-Day Saints own their homes . Beyond a doubt , the Mormon church is , considered purely as a political economist 's scheme , " to-day nearer to being a successful effort to inaugurate the brotherhood of man than anything ever tried . " Here , then , is a social and political force to be reckoned with . Marvelous in its power over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nation . Already it numbers a million adherents . It owns Utah . It holds the balance of power in Idaho , in Wyoming , in Colorado , in California , and in Nevada . When Arizona and New Mexico are admitted to the Union , it will control them also . Having traced the picturesque evolution of the Mormon hobgoblin , we are ? brought face to face with a psychological puzzle of the first order . How in this humdrum worldkin of ours did mortal men ever come to do this-madness ? I applied for instruction to the heads of the church , who welcomed me with so charming a courtesy that I have never seen it snatched save among the gracious , fatherly Cohenim of the Salem Street ghetto . Gentle souls are these Mormon patriarchs , ? soft - voiced , sunny , and smooth ; and many a pleasant evening have I passed , sitting patient at their 264 The Mormons. feet . Thus , little by little , I came to a comprehension of the forces ? both psychic and civic ? which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the force of objective authority . Trace the whole long path of religions reflection , and you find but four sanctions for doctrinal tenet : the Roman sanction , which is the church ; the Old Evangelical sanction , which is the letter of Scripture ; the Progressive Orthodox sanction , which is the teaching of Christ ; and the Outer Liberal sanction , which is the individual reason . And now comes the Mormon , seeking adherents . " What ! " cries the Catholic . " Leave my church for yours , ? mine with its divine origin , its ? venerable history , its gorgeous ritual , its adoration of the blessed Mother of God , for yours with a claim no sterner and a temple worship no lovelier ? " Mormon missions fall fruitless in Romish lands . " A shame , " cries Progressive Orthodoxy , " to exalt the Old Testament to rank with the New ! " Since the beginning of the Progressive Orthodox transition , the Mormon evangelist has appealed solely to the ignorant , unenlightened masses . " Oh , pitiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book authority for us ! " You never saw the rationalist taught by Joseph Smith . But with the Old Evangelical how widely different the case ! Truly , the Mormon church is the legitimate by-product of the Calvinistic theology . Make Scripture the seat of religions authority ; call the Bible , not a record of spiritual evolution , but an indiscriminate armory of proof texts ; adopt an antique in : , , wpretation of prophecy ; and , bless you , you are out upon the broad highroad to Salt Lake City . " Keep your Bible , " says the Latter-Day Saint , " believe it from cover to cover ; but add the Book of Mormon , which explains its mysteries , reconciles its discrepancies , sustains its doctrines , and exactly fulfills its predictions . " No other creed is so literalistic , no other church so immovably based on the letter of Scripture . How came this so ? Not , I think , by the hand of Joseph Smith . It is far more probable that Sidney Rigdon , long an intimate associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mormon doctrine . For Campbell and Rigdon had formerly shared the hope of founding a new religion , and Campbell 's Biblical erudition has rarely been equaled . The two quarreled . Campbell went one way to establish his " Campbellite " Disciples , Rigdon another to foist upon the world the Book of Mormon and its youthful prophet . Hence the skill which suited Mormon teaching to its purpose . Hence also its vast inclusiveness . In this lies a further secret . The faith is a huge maw , gulping a dozen denominations . Are you a Baptist ? The Mormon believes in immersion . A Methodist ? The Mormon obeys his bishop . A Campbellite ? The Mormon claims a yet closer return to apostolic ordinance . A Theosophist ? The Mormon holds to preexistence . A Spiritualist ? The Mormon hears voices from the dead . A Faith Healer ? The Mormon heals by the laying on of hands . A Second Adventist ? The Mormon awaits the Messiah . A Universalist ? The Mormon says all will be saved . Massing his proof , lie declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in the early age and restored in the latter days , though glimmering in broken lights through all the creeds of Christendom . " Bring me from Europe or Asia , " said Brigham Young , " a truth that is not a part of Mormonism , and I ' 11 give you a thousand errors for it , if you can find them . " Said a Mormon at Harvard , " Sunday by Sunday I go to service in the Appleton Chapel , and there I hear nothing but Mormon doctrine . " Limited only by the broad bounds of Christianity , this faith is an amalgamated and coordinated Parliament of Religions . The Mo Mormonism wins by breadth ; also by narrowness . It meets crude thought with a crude anthropomorphism . It preaches a God of bone and of flesh , in his every attribute human . And this Mormon caricature of divinity resorts for Scriptural sanction to the earlier portions of the Old Testament . The God of Joseph Smith and of Brigham Young , Mormons will tell you , is the God of Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to reconcile so blunt a doctrine with the refinements of historic Christianity , God is made omnipresent through Ibe Holy Spirit , and the mystery of the Trinity is solved by the assumption of three separate Persons united by a common purpose . " Pure polytheism , " I said . " Yes , " came the answer ; " is n't it grand ? " Moreover , the Mormonite realizes that the low religious instinct craves tangible evidence of the unseen . Supi Yawlat caresses the feet of her mud-made Buddha ; Sister Angelique clasps her crucifix ; millions of Protestants worship their Bibles ; but here is a gospel declared by a living prophet , mouthpiece of God and " boss of Jehovah 's buckler ; here a creed beset on every hand with visible marvels , ? miracles , healings , prophecies , revelations , and speaking with tongues . Am I taking the Mormon too gravely ? Perhaps . For to-day the appeal of Mormonism is less doctrinal than material . It dangles loaves and fishes before hungry mouths . It promises fertile lands in fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Georgia . It says to the ragged outcasts of Darkest England , " Come with us to happy Utah : you find no want there ; there is plentiful work for all , there is wealth for honest labor . " And yet , originally , the power of Mormonism was unquestionably the power of doctrine . It entered American life at a period of intense illiberality . The air was full of schism . The sects teemed with recalcitrants . The time was ripe for the establishment of a church so // broadly comprehensive as to welcome the malcontents of all Christendom . Mormonism has from . the first depended for its very life and heart throb upon ceaseless campaigns of propagandism . Aside from the lure of its doctrine or the gaudy fascination of its pledges , it triumphs by main strength . Two thousand youthful " elders " roam through " the world , " seeking whom they may convert . They sprinkle the earth with tracts ; they pass from cottage to cottage , teaching and preaching ; they travel at their own expense , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they live like Napoleon 's army , " on the country . " So , considering their numbers and their zealous labor , the marvel is not that they bring home adherents ; the marvel is that they bring so few . Here , then , are the forces that fetch men to Utah . See now what keeps them there , and keeps them loyal . Missionary service seals the soul for the object of its devotion . Nearly every young Mormon ? that is , nearly every young man , and now they are sending young women also ? goes out to toil and to suffer for the faith . And there is in all this world no confirmation of a faith like that of abuse and contumely endured in its service . Tithing has also its power . Drop , year by year , a tenth of your income into the coffers of your church , and you learn to love it . Again , enormous strength lies hid in the extraordinary acoustic properties of Mormonism . A pin let fail in a hat can be heard clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First President is audible in the remotest gulch or canon of the kingdom . What with his two counselors , his twelve apostles , his presidents of the stake , his bishops , his seventies , his elders , and his teachers , the whisper passes down from ear to ear , changing from English to Swedish , from Swedish to German , from German to Danish , ? a miracle of tongues and interpretation of tongues , ? The Mormons. till perchance it comes , harsh and sibilant , through the key hole of your kitchen door to the maid with her hands in the dough . Cr back , up that ladder of listening ears , goes the whisper of the teacher , to be heard in the president 's office . The German government is paternal , but an ill parent compared with this ; Tammany Hall a superb organization , but lax beside Mormonism . The ward heeler , that dread bogyman of city politics ; ? what now is he ? A petty amateur . This Mormon church boasts the grandest ecclesiastical , political , commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The church will stop them . Is schism afloat ? The church will check it . Is wealth to be gained ? The church stands behind the counter with Zion 's Cooperative Mercantile Institution . Is Gentile competition becoming alarming ? The church bids its people trade with one another . Are the rills of irrigation like to be wasted ? The church sets just the hour and minute for the farmer to open the trench . Are votes to be polled ? The church gives commands . There have not been forty scratched ballots in forty years . Are there poor to be fed ? The church will feed them . Consequently , whoever once enters so complete a freemasonry finds it not only exceedingly difficult to get out , but also exceedingly desirable to stay in . Besides , in the day when this iron order was welded , the doctrine of blood atonement had its hideous red part to play . Said Brigham Young : " There are sins that men commit for which they can not receive forgiveness in this world or in that which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see their true condition , they would be perfectly willing to have their blood spilt upon the ground , that the smoke thereof might ascend to heaven as an offering for their sins , and the smoking incense would atone for their sins ; whereas , if such is not the case , they will stick to them , and remain upon them in the spirit world . . . . I know , when you hear my brethren telling about cutting people off from the earth , that you consider it a strong doctrine ; but it is to save them , not to destroy them . " Now one of these unforgivable sins , from which men might be saved by assassination , was the sin of apostasy from the Mormon church . " Rather than that apostasy should flourish here , " bellowed the prophet Brigham in a mighty discourse , " I will unsheathe my bowie knife , and conquer or die ! " Such was the temper of the Mormon Bismarck . But the main cohesive force is polygamy . Here is once more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , or we shall all hang separately . " With an appalling uniformity , it is polygamists who rise to ecclesiastical eminence . Such can be trusted . Such will stay put . This Mormon church binds its adherents with the strongest bonds known under heaven . It is at once a religion , an empire , a fraternity , a trust , and a partnership in crime . III . Though the Mormons had built them a nest in the wilderness , they might not remain there at rest . The Mexican war brought the folk of Deseret back into hated . American territory . A mad rush to our newly acquired California swept in throngs of strangers . An army post on the bench above Salt Lake City took away its sovereignty . The railroad , offering swift escape to Gentile prescripts , and as swift inrushing of government troops whenever they might be needed , gave freedom of speech . Schism cleft the church ; the Godbeites seceded ; they assailed polygamy , and they founded a journal which became the Salt Lake Tribune , ? intensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sects , whose missionaries returned East and inflamed national sentiment . // ticians . Beginning in Utah , the agitation soon spread throughout the whole land . Alarming falsehoods of Mormon disloyalty , vice , and abominations soon stirred the people of the nation and their national representatives to a fever heat against the Saints . .. . The Edmunds law was signed by President Arthur on the 22d of March , 1882 . Polygamy was made punishable by disfranchisement ; also a fine of not more than five hundred dollars , and imprisonment for not more than three years . Cohabitation with more than one woman was punishable by a fine not to exceed three hundred dollars , and imprisonment not to exceed six months . Polygamists and believers in the doctrine of plural marriage were rendered incompetent to act as jurors . No polygamist could hold office or vote . In 1887 a supplemental act was passed , known as the Edmunds-Tucker law . This gave additional powers to the officers , required certificates of all marriages to be filed in the offices of the probate courts ( whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , disincorporated the church , and ordered the Supreme Court to wind up its affairs and to take possession of its escheated property . Twelve thousand persons were disfranchised . A test oath was subscribed to by those Mormons who decided to retain their rights of franchise , ? the election machinery having been placed in the hands of a commission of five , appointed by the President of the United States . Their political rights thus interdicted , the Mormons were set upon by the judiciary . . . . There followed an unjustifiably cruel legal persecution . Upwards of a thousand men were sent to the penitentiary , because they would not promise to discard their families . Hundreds were striven into retirement or exile , families were broken up . There was untold sorrow and heart-suffering in their midst . Juries obtained by open venire were unanimous in obeying the bidding of 2118 The Mormons. overzealous prosecuting attorneys who were determined on conviction . As a rule , to be suspected was equivalent to arrest , arrest to indictment , indictment to conviction , conviction to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them very immoral , adventurers dogged the steps or raided the homes of respectable veterans , founders of the commonwealth . Government aided in the enforcement of the law by increasing special appropriations . Paid spotters and spies prowled among the people . . . . ' the Saints were passing through a night of dreary darkness . Bereft of the counsels and presence of their leaders , torn with anguish , they were taught the lessons of self - reliance , dependence upon the Lord , faith in God . " A pious fox , was it not ? Hunted and harried near to death , it at last ran into its earth in the Temple , and whined piteously to heaven . " President Woodruff sought the Lord " in behalf of his afflicted people , " and in answer to his petitions of anguish received the word of the Lord authorizing the Saints to discontinue their practice of plural marriage . " Then the Gentiles , taking ' Mormon word in good faith , recognized " changed conditions , " and made Utah a sovereign state . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leads his pursuers once more a steaming chase . For there are times in the life of every right-minded fox when he is so good that he is sorry afterwards , and the Mormon church has lately come to one of those times . The Saints break their pledge two ways at once . The editor of the Deseret News ( the " organ of the Lord ' ' ) admits new plural marriages since the manifesto of 1890 , while no one attempts to cloak or dissemble the survival of numberless plural marriages contracted before that manifesto . " Let Utah alone , " says B. H. Roberts . " Polygamy will die of itself , " says the Mormon church . Polygamy , I reply , will die when we kill it , and not sooner . What matter if new polygamons marriages are rare ; what matter if they have to be contracted in states other than Utah ; what matter if an apostle must enter into a ship and sail out into the Pacific Ocean , that he may espouse a fifth concubine ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble is the determined attitude of the Mormon church , which permits the crime , covers the crime , and honors the criminal . Only when Zion will cut off a Saint for Isis breaking the law can we take Mormon declarations as anything but the delicious hoaxes they have hitherto proved to be . With the survival or rehabilitation of plural marriages contracted before the manifesto we have . been altogether too lenient . Mormons say : " Sir , suppose that for fifteen years you have had two wives ; suppose you tenderly loved them both ; and then suppose that Congress should compel you to relinquish one of them . Do you think you would keep the law ? " What puling sentimentality ! These Mormons took their plural wives when polygamy was a crime ; they perjured themselves , one and all , when they promised to give them up ; and now they stand defiant . A thousand polygamous children have beets born in Utah since it was made a state . The church smugly grins and approves . Naturally , for its leaders rank chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is traversing the state to expose polygamists , telegraphed his paper a dispatch which concluded with this interesting summary : " Of the fifteen leaders who pledged their faith and honor for the future compliance with the law by the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints , eleven have been actually guilty of the transgression of the law. ; one is undoubtedly morally so ; and three , two of whom are exceedingly old and feeble men , have complied with the pledge given to the people of the United States through their president . " There was also a purely political side t of the contest with Mormonism . Salt 1 Lake , a walled city for years , still re- I mained departmentally a close corpora- tion in the hands of the Mormons . For three long decades their opponents , the " Liberal " party , persevered with a pa- triotic , unselfish patience , awaiting re- cognition . Their ranks grew , also their power ; and in 1889 , to the surprise of every Gentile , they carried the county election . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have posted a writ ( like that of his Helena comrade , when the capital of Montana had been snatched from Anaconda ) to the effect that " any man found sober on the streets after midnight would be run in . " The next year Gentiles learned a lesson from Mot. - mondom , organized " tens " in room of " seventies , " accounted for every vote in every block in every ward , bought drums by the carload and torches by the mile , and fought " the greatest political battle ever pulled off in this country . " When the returns lagged in , all good Mormons buried their heads in the sand . Gentiles thronged the streets . The city flamed with bonfires . Bales , crates , boxes , gates , horse-blocks , signs , wagons , ? in short , every movable and combusti- ble object in sight was gayly tossed into the blaze . Then followed an era of dazzling re- form . The Gentile administration built a million-dollar town hall , established a public library , borrowed $860,000 and spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paved the streets , lighted them with electricity , piped them for eighty miles with water mains , and tunneled some $400,000 worth of deep drains . But alas , their heads reeling with success , the Liberal party lost their balance , and the Mormon church had its way once more . Consequence , com- promise . The former factions should vapor away , and there should be thence- forward division on Republican and De-mocratic party lines . And so it goes he spread across my lap and across both arms of my chair , while I took the rest in my hand . One caught my fancy , ? a dainty lass of seventeen , wide-browed and fair , with the look of a Perugino angel . " A dear , sweet girl , " said Abou ben Brigham . " Polygamous child . And I tell you , sir , if Congress knew what splendid children are born in polygamy , we ' d soon see an end of this cruel persecution . " Another oily sentimentalist proudly whipped open his watch , where lurked a composite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supreme exaltation of earthly existence , and the sole key to highest heaven . " Hence the Mormon definition of happiness : forty feet on a fender . The exegetical Mormon sleeps with a Holy Bible beneath his pillow . Being a logbook of spiritual progress , the Scripture reflects the successive stages of psychical evolution which produced it . Polygamy prevailing in old Israel , you find no condemnation of it in the Pentateuch ; polygamy disappearing from the Semitic social order , you find no mention of it in the gospel ; neither is monogamy distinctly commanded there . And this is most unfortunate . For never will you persuade a Brigbamite to call Christian marriage a lily sprung out of the mire . He " believes his Bible from cover to cover , " and finding no explicit mention of the pale , pure lily , makes himself a filthy mud gospel from the muck and slime at its root . Nothing can exceed the glibness of his Biblical citations . The Book , forsooth , has turned bins a pious knave . To break law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wife of his bosom that he is about to fetch home at concubine , he puts on a sweet , smug front , and says , " Dearie , I 'm resolved to live closer to my church and my God . " She demurs ? Not for long . He will open the sacred volume , and read her a thing or two . This is a commentary on the doctrine of an infallible , inerrant , and verbally inspired di vine book , every part of which is as good as every other . The philosophical Mormon prates long and loud of preexistence and the bright world above us . Human souls , he will argue , had a life of their own ere they entered the body . That magnificent welter of white clouds amid the snowcapped mountain crags is crowded with untabernacled spirits longing to enter upon corporeal existence . Merciful , then , is plural marriage ; which provides in roundest number the fleshly coils they crave . Suppose a man take a wife ; suppose the wife die ; suppose the man marry again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedded to both in paradise ; for Mormons are joined together for time and eternity . If polygamy is right in heaven , it must a fortiori be right on earth . " Quod erat demonstrandum . " The sociological Mormon would floor you with statistics . There are more women than men . Unspeakably sad , says he , were it not for polygamy . Curse on his hypocrisy ! See what polygamy means . Here are four sisters married to one man ; yonder mother and daughter share the love of a bishop ; while just over the way , a priest of the order of Melchizedek has lately espoused the granddaughter of his second wife . And what , ' think you , will be the moral possibilities of children bred of such unions and reared in such homes ? Now the barnyard Mormon keeps this to his honor : he owns the truth . He crassly confesses the creed of the mews . But of the barnyard Mormon the less said the better . Are these , then , five wholly distinct and separate classes of Mormons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or all of the others . Mormons , like Gentiles , are moved by mingled motives , ? one compels , another condones . Sin wears the varied robe of hypocrisy . Yet this applies only to men . And , Heaven save us , what of the women ? They reason alike , and they reason thus Polyga- deleted material needed . Hammered hard enough , he will receive a " revelation ; " the revelation will bid him submit . Then how pliable , and at last how feeble , this monster ! The Mormon was once commanded to take many wives ; then commanded to discard all but one . " God gave us that precious privilege , " he says , " and afterward took it from us , because we had not sufficiently availed ourselves of it . " The gods of Utah are continually changing their minds ; they have always their ears to the ground . Let us make short shrift of polygamy . Let us promptly cease winking at crime and at treason , for there is no mercy in temporizing sentimentality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We must immediately frame a constitutional amendment , prohibiting polygamy in every part of the United States . That will throw all such cases squarely upon the federal courts , where they belong . Two things will happen : the Gentiles will soon outnumber the Mormons ; the Mormon empire will disintegrate .
