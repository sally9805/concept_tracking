 |p581  I. Is Italy to give birth to a new Renaissance , and to repeat the superb gifts which she bestowed on the world in the Middle Ages ? There are signs of a new birth in the stirrings of spiritual life so evident in the last year or two throughout the Italian peninsula . And the whole world 's attention has been called to these newly springing life-forces by the Syllabus of last July , and the recent Encyclical . " It is , " the Syllabus tells us , " a matter for the profoundest regret that a certain number of Catholic writers , transgressing the limits established by the fathers and the Church herself , have devoted themselves to the alleged development of dogmas , whilst in reality , under the pretext of higher research , and in the name of history , they explain away the dogmas themselves . " Among the positions which the Syllabus finds it necessary to affirm against these innovators , we find the declaration that " divine inspiration guarantees all and every part of the Holy Scriptures against error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right " to pass judgment on natural sciences " ; the Syllabus further denies that " the Christian doctrine was first Judaic , then Pauline , then Hellenic , then Universal " ; and declares that it is false to assert that " the Roman Church became the head of all churches , not by divine ordinance , but by purely political circumstances . " The Syllabus , it is worth noting , bears the ominous name of the " Holy Inquisition . " On the other side , we find the Young Catholic party declaring , as in " Il Rinnovamento , " * that for them :  |p582  " Christianity is Life : it is unquenchable aspiration , it is hope , it is the striving of the whole being toward that which in life partakes of the eternal ; it is the progressive elevation of our hearts and minds in a passionate search after truth , and an ardent turning toward it ; it is the soul 's claim to a life in the future . It is in vain that we try to enclose Christianity in intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by its very nature , a continuous becoming , which bursts through its ancient coverings to create ever new ones , which moulds and remoulds the forms through which it communicates itself to the intellect ; in a perennial movement of renovation , as if a divine artificer were seeking to express in pliant clay , ceaselessly and ever unsatisfied , his ineffable ideal . Every religious conception which pretends in the name of faith to bind the intellect to determinate philosophical and social doctrines , and thinks possible a specifically orthodox science , art or politics , is false in its root . And if we deem possible a new Christian civilization , it is on one condition : that the spirit of Christ signifies the spirit of liberation , no one seeking to confine it to his own theories , hypotheses or systems , but each feeling it as an imminent command in his heart to uplift his life in all its activities . " This is finely said , and in the true spirit of liberty . The Vatican retorts : * " Rebels , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artful forms monstrous errors on the evolution of dogma ; on the return to the Gospel ? the Gospel , that is to say , stripped , as they put it , of the explanations of theology , of the definitions of Councils , of the maxims of asceticism ; on the emancipation of the Church , but conceived after a new fashion ? an emancipation which will enable them not to revolt , so that they may not be cut off , and yet not to submit , so that they need not abandon their own convictions .... We count , however , much on your aid , Venerable Brethren , so that whensoever you , with the Bishops your suffragans in your provinces , learn of these sowers of tares , you may unite with us in combating them , inform us of the peril to which souls are exposed , denounce their books to the Sacred Roman Congregations , and meanwhile , using the powers which have been granted to you by the Sacred Canons , may solemnly condemn them , persuaded of the very serious obligation you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church , to combat error and defend the truth even to the shedding of blood . " A group of Italian priests , speaking for the Young Catholics , thus reply : " Our state of mind at this moment is the same as that which spurred Saint Catherine of Siena to display her indignation against Urban VI ( when with a passionate unfeelingness he sought to blunt her eager-  |p583  ness in her schemes of reform ) , by hurling at him these words , so living in their present application : Justice without mercy would be injustice rather than justice . Do what you do in measure ( for to act without measure destroys rather than mends ) , and with benevolence and peaceful heart . For the love of Christ Crucified , moderate a little those sudden movements to which Nature urges you . ' For us , profoundly Christian souls , religion , far from being a vague mystical feeling which soothes the spirit and isolates it in a barren egotism , is a Divine reality , which kindles into life and exalts the souls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brotherhood , directs their life toward a supreme and common goal " As the rejoinder of the Vatican , we have the Syllabus of last July , and the Encyclical of September , which recommends a policy of inquisition and prosecution , the establishment of censors all over the field of Christendom , who are to detect error , and tear the subversive books from the hands of the flocks ; while the teachers of these dangerous doctrines are to be driven from their parishes , or , if teachers , are to be expelled from their colleges and schools . The brand of heresy is stamped upon them , and they are held up to the reprobation of the faithful . It is both interesting and ominous to find the Vatican seeking thus to stem the tide of intellectual life , and ordering the combating of error " even to the shedding of blood . " More important than the views which the Vatican may espouse or denounce is the motive principle of this new Crusade against heresy : the assumption that the Vatican has authority to declare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not be held true , whether in criticism , history or science ; the claim of the Vatican to exercise , by divine right , a despotic power over men 's intellects , forbidding to the faithful all true liberty of thought . Are we or are we not prepared to grant this claim ? The whole question turns on that . II . The Vatican is wise in forbidding genuine research into the meaning of the Scriptures , and in laying down an " orthodox " view of the early history of Christendom . For nothing is more certain than that a candid study of the Scriptures , a sincere examination of early history , will cut at the root of the Vatican 's assumptions . The claim of intellectual despotism is wholly unwarranted by the words of Jesus Himself , and by the whole spirit of His teachings ; it is wholly unwarranted by the words and  |p584  conduct of the Apostles ; it is unwarranted by the early practice of the Church . This claim grew up , I am entirely convinced , as a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of Sovereign Pontiff till then worn by the Roman Caesars , and with that title assumed much of the Caesars ' power . And this claim to intellectual despotism has always gone hand in hand with civil persecution , and with the assertion of political suzerainty over Christendom . Let us begin with the heart of the matter . Where do we find Jesus claiming despotic authority over men 's intellects , and demanding that they shall renounce their convictions ? Where do we find Jesus countenancing civil persecution ? Can we imagine Jesus , in the black robe of the Inquisitor , dragging forth " heretics " by the hundred , and burning them at the stake ? Can we think of Jesus organizing a bloody Crusade against the Waldenses , and hurling " mother with infant down the rocks " ? If Jesus would have authorized these things , why did He not do them Himself ? Why did He not summon the twelve legions of angels and drive Herod from Jerusalem , setting up the " temporal power " in the City of David ? Has He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of this world . " Jesus does not say : " Whoever dares to think otherwise than I , let him be anathema " ; He does say : " Come unto me , all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me , for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls . " Jesus does not say : " Whosoever shall depart from the orthodox faith , let him die the death . " He does say : " He that hath My commandments and keepeth them , he it is that loveth Me , and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father , and we will come unto him and make our abode with him . " And does not Jesus specifically command His disciples to be subject to the political power of the state even though that power was pagan and idolatrous : " Reddite ergo quae sunt Caesaris Caesari : et quae sunt Dei , Deo " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual heir of Peter , and that this despotic power was given to Peter by Jesus Himself , who designated Peter prince of the apostles , and subordinated them to Peter 's supremacy . I venture to say that there is no warrant in the New Testament for the  |p585  claim that such authority was ever exercised by Peter , or that Peter himself ever dreamed of exercising it . This claim of the supremacy of Peter is a cardinal part of the Vatican 's claims , and should be " sifted as wheat is sifted . " The Vatican has always made much of the text , " Tu es Petrus " ; but was it not said to all the disciples equally : " Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven " ? And do we not find " the keys of death and of hell , " not in the hands of Peter , according to the Apocalypse , but in the hands of " the Son of Man " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does he not , in writing to the Galatians , go out of his way to show that his authority is wholly independent of Peter , and equal to Peter 's : " He that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles " ? Did Paul recognize the authority of Peter , when he says : " But when Peter was come to Antioch , I withstood him to the face , " and rebuked Peter openly for hypocrisy . If this striking incident shows anything , it shows , not that Paul deferred to Peter , but that Peter deferred to James " the brother of the Lord . " Again , James , who was not one of the Twelve , and so may be said to have held a lower place , nowhere in his Epistle refers to Peter , or recognizes his " authority . " And Jude , when he wishes to recommend himself , refers not to Peter , but to James . John also is wholly silent as to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an implication of the independent spiritual authority of John in the Master 's words : " If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ? " Finally , Peter himself nowhere says anything which might lead us to infer that he had any thought of his own supremacy . Does he not most touchingly describe himself simply as " a coelder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ " ? Peter 's view as to the authority of elders and overseers , of priests and bishops , is purely spiritual , and in perfect harmony with the spirit of the Master . He expressly forbids the bishops to " lord it " over the faithful , declaring that their only authority should be that of holy example . And he most significantly adds : " Yea , all of you be clothed with humility , for God resisteth the proud , and giveth grace unto the humble . " I have always thought that Peter 's use of this phrase , " lording it over the inheritance , " was  |p586  a reminiscence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them . But it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ; and whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant " Nothing could be plainer . The Master and His disciple , in the same words , declare that domination , assertion of authority , despotism , is the very negation of spiritual life . And what has Peter to say of the " temporal power " claimed for so many centuries in his name ? He is explicit : " Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord 's sake : whether it be to the king as supreme ; or unto governors . . . . For so is the will of God . . . . Honor all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honor the King . " Will it be said that the sovereign thus recommended by Peter was distinguished by such piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But tradition tells us that Peter wrote this in Rome , under Nero , who had gained the throne by the poisoning of his predecessor , who poisoned his rival , caused the murder of his own mother , had one wife slain and himself killed another , and finally , after an ignoble and cruel life , found a shameful death at his own hand . If Peter could recommend obedience to the son-in-law of Messalina , what becomes of the necessity of temporal power ? III . It seems undeniable that Jesus gave equal authority to all his Apostles , and that they all recognized this ; and , further , that Paul and James , who were not of the Twelve , exercised exactly the same measure of influence and authority . This power was purely spiritual ; that of a holy example , of fervor and aspiration ; and it would have been utterly repugnant to any of them to call in civil force , or assert their rights " even to the shedding of blood . " The supremacy of Peter was an afterthought , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metropolis of the Empire , had acquired preeminent influence . But in the early days Rome did not claim to be the See founded by Peter ; it was always the See " of Peter and Paul . " Other Sees were founded by the other disciples , and they were @#  |p587  very far from recognizing any supremacy , in the sense of despotic authority , in the See of Rome . Saint John , ancient authorities tell us , founded the See of Smyrna . Polycarp , as the successor and disciple of John , went to Rome to Anicetus the bishop , to support the tradition of John against the tradition of Rome as to the celebration of Easter . The Fathers of the early period assert the equality of the disciples . Do we not find Origen writing : " If you hold that the whole Church was built by God on Peter alone , what will you say concerning John , the son of thunder , and each of the other Apostles ? " Irenicus also opposes the supremacy of Rome , and rebukes Victor I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tradition concerning Easter . Tertullian disapproves of the assumption by the bishops of Rome of the titles of Pontifex Maximus and Episcopus Episcoporum , and distinctly denies the claim made by Zephyrinus of a certain superiority in the Roman See derived as a tradition from Saint Peter . Even Jerome , the pillar of the Latin Church , does not recognize the papacy in the full sense . One has only to read , for example , the story of the Council of Nicaea to see that it was universally held that the only valid authority was that of the whole Church , and that the supremacy of Rome , in the later sense , had then no existence . The representatives of Rome at that great Council played no great part , and exercised no special prerogatives . The creation of Roman supremacy was the work of men like the Roman rhetorician whom we know as Saint Augustine , the Roman citizen whom we know as Leo the Great , the Roman pm-tor who became the first Pope Gregory ; and it was built on the ruins of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goths . An understanding was reached between the Vatican and the new empire , under which each supported the other , and for centuries no election of a Pope was final until it had secured the approval of the Emperor . It is noteworthy that Pope Pius X owes his succession to the papal power to that ageold compact , if it be true that Kaiser Franz-Josef , as master of the Holy Roman Empire , exercised his right of veto against Cardinal Rampolla . IV . In defiance of the words of the Scripture and the practice of  |p588  the Apostolic age and the early Fathers , the claims of the bishops of Rome to political power and mental domination steadily increased . It is written : " Either make the tree good , and his fruit good , or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit . " Let us consider the fruit of the tree . As early as the Theodosian Code , we find the alliance with the civil power used as an instrument of persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in perfect anticipation of the " Holy Inquisition . " Hildebrand , who assumed the triple tiara as Gregory VII , went further ; he asserted that all political authority was derived from the Pope . He made good his claim against the Emperor , and demanded that William the Conqueror should do allegiance for the throne of England . Here Hildebrand was met with flat refusal . Yet the Pope 's claim to political suzerainty was made good . Innocent III succeeded where Gregory VII had failed . He brought the King of England to his knees , and forced him to become a vassal of Rome . To take other instances : in 1465 Pope Paul II deposed the King of Bohemia , and brought on a sanguinary war . Half a century later Pope Julius II deposed the King of Navarre . But the most signal instance of this political usurpation came in 1215 , when Innocent III formally cursed the Great Charter of England , " in the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit : Damnamus sub intimatione Anathematis prohibentes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicibus suis ipsam exigant observari : tam Chartam quam obligationes .... " Thus did the Vatican set its face like flint against the Charter of modern liberty . Infinitely worse was another event of the same year . Summoning the bishops to Rome , Innocent III read to them the decrees which , after they had listened to them in silence , were recorded as the decrees of the Fourth Lateran Council . Among these were two of ominous note : one approving the massacre of the Waldenses , and the other establishing the " Holy Inquisition . " It is not my intention to enlarge on that massacre , or to discuss the question whether Torquemada burned three thousand or thirty thousand . " heretics . " Let the dead past bury its dead . But what must be insisted on is this : that the poison of despot/ ism , once taken into the veins of an ecclesiastical organization , will always work deadly harm . There are evil powers in the heart which despotism kindles , and they bear horrible fruit of torture and massacre . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purest spirituality within the Church . To it belong the great names of Saint Francis , Saint Catherine of Siena , Saint Thomas a Kempis , for whom one can have nothing but reverent admiration . These peerless souls , and multitudes of others less renowned , were the salt of the earth , the leaven of the Church , in a very real sense . For no one with reverent faith in the God of love can believe that the Church of Christ was upheld by the butchery of the Albigenses , the fires of the Inquisition . Was it not rather the spiritual power of the true followers of the Master , who " heard his commandments and kept them , " which upheld the Church as on a rock ? May we not believe in an unbroken succession of such saints , rich in love and purity , forming the soul of the Church within the temporal body , and breathing forth a spiritual power which kept the Church sweet through centuries of despotism and cruelty ? V. We have seen that Origen , Irenwus , Tertullian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that Origen expressly declares that the Church was not founded on Peter alone . In like manner , we find the Council of Nicma expressly recognizing other Sees ? Antioch and Alexandria , for instance ? as " Apostolic Sees , " a title later appropriated by Rome . This question was the cause of the division between the Eastern and the Western churches . It was the claim of Gregory VII and of Innocent III to exercise supreme authority over these independent Apostolic Sees of the East which tore Christendom in twain . In like manner , the claim of the See of Rome to exercise intellectual despotism over Christendom was the real source of the later division which sprang from the fiery protest of Martin Luther . There was crying need for purification . But had there been more moderate counsels on both sides , had the claims of the Vatican been abated , while the Reformers checked their violence , we might have had a strong and vital evolution of the Church without division , the vigorous spiritual forces of Northern Europe developing within its boundaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have had the great movements of modern science , saved from materialism , growing up in an atmosphere of reverence and spiritual life . Had she not insisted on banishing intellectual liberty , the Church might have been saved from the ignominy of that famous decree : " We say , pronounce , declare that you , the said Galileo , by reason of the matters adduced in process , and by you confessed as above , have rendered yourself , in the judgment of this Holy Office , vehemently suspected of heresy , namely , of having believed and held the doctrine , which is false and contrary to the Sacred and Divine Scriptures , that the sun is the centre of the system and does not move from east to west , and that the earth is not the centre of the system . . . . " We may say , therefore , that the tree is judged by its fruits . The Vatican 's successive claims of supremacy , of civil suzerainty and intellectual despotism twice rent Christendom in twain , forcing the separation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolt the nations of Northern Europe , in the movement of the Reformation . And these same claims , and most of all that of intellectual despotism , lit the pyres of the Inquisition , spread massacre through the Piedmont valleys , gave hundreds up to torture and death , and wrought a myriad agonies through the Middle Ages . VI . What most imports us to recognize to-day is that Pius X is making exactly the same claims as the most extreme of his predecessors . He has openly declared that the separation of Church and State is a " pernicious error , " and he evidently holds that the Church is higher than the State . But even more certain and much more significant is his steady adherence to the principle of intellectual despotism , as illustrated by the Syllabus , the Encyclicals , the Papal pronouncements . He firmly believes that he holds the right to say what Christians shall and shall not believe , whether as to the Scriptures , the early history of the Church or the facts and theories of science ; and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience , " even to the shedding of blood . " It is well for us to realize exactly what is going on within the Catholic Church ; this spirit on the one side , and , on the other , countless ardent souls , including many among the priesthood , who are touched with the light , who have recognized the great results of science , and especially the splendid  |p591  doctrine of evolution , which gives such scope to the majesty of God , and who , with this recognition , are far from anything like materialism , but are rather full of the brightest faith in spiritual life , and see all events around them as manifestations of the Divine . These children of the light are further filled with the true gentleness and charity which are the heart of the message of Jesus . They recognize , with sorrow , the evil part played in the world 's history by spiritual and intellectual despotism , and they look forward with confidence to a day when the Catholic Church shall be regenerated under the perfect law of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in sharing it , set forth the causes which , in our view , will make for the coming of that brighter day ? If we are right , and we call on history to vindicate us , the evil which for centuries overshadowed Europe like a nightmare has a clearly defined source : the principle of " domination . " Jesus Himself set up no authority , but taught the perfect law of love and obedience to the divine will . For Jesus , orthodoxy was not a belief , but a life : " He that hath My commandments and keepeth them , he it is that loveth Me " ; " Not every one that saith unto Me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven , but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven . " There is no question here of any one declaring what another shall or shall not believe ; there is a question of denying one 's self , of hating one 's life that one may keep it unto life eternal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience to the law of love , the law of sacrifice . And those should exercise authority who most perfectly exemplify the spirit of the Master , and , by perfect obedience , are united in spirit to the Master . Even then their authority must ever be that of a holy example ; they must never " lord it over the inheritance , " and , if they win anything of the spirit of the Master , they can never so lord it , for does not the Master say : " I am meek and lowly in heart " ? VII . Let us declare an irenicon . Let us recognize , in our human frailty , the ever-present temptation to dominate others , to force others to do as we wish , to think as we ordain . Let us admit that this evil ambition is widespread , that it has worked through all ages . Let us say that it was but natural , and hardly to be  |p592  avoided , that this same vice of ambition should steal into the fold , and taint the hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose the desire to dominate , the wish to command , the will to persecute ; and the subtle mind , ever obedient to the false desires of the heart , forged excuses for these evil desires . Thus in the Church instead of the perfect law of liberty grew up intellectual tyranny , each party ordaining what others should believe , instead of trusting to the divine light in the heart of each to lead him into all truth . Let us admit that , through the fall of the Roman Empire and the coming of the Goths , an opportunity was given for ambition to assert itself and , with much appearance of righteousness , to grasp after civil power and intellectual despotism ; and that the seed thus sown bore much evil fruit . Let us take this long , sad history for a warning , and cast from our hearts that ambition to rule , through which the angels fell . If we , each in his several heart , shall kill out ambition , the desire to dominate the thoughts and acts of others , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around us softening and mellowing , and that gentle influence will in due time invade and transform the Vatican itself . The principle of domination once withdrawn , the way will be opened for the repair of the rending of Christendom caused by that principle 's enforcement . The two parts of Christendom which divided on this principle in the sixteenth century may once more come together in brotherly union and concord . And once the claim of domination , of autocratic central power , is abated , the causes which forced the separation of the Eastern Apostolic Sees will have ceased to exist , and that great division also may be overcome . Then we shall see a Church truly Catholic , united by a common obedience to the spirit of the blaster , and recognizing that that spirit is expressed through the whole body of those who obey the Master , the Light lightening every heart . Nor need this irenicon be confined to Christendom alone . Shall we not find , once we abate the evil tendency to dictate the beliefs of others , that the differences between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance ; that all men of good-will , under whatever sky , have held in their hearts the same awe of the divine , the same hope of immortality . @#
