 | EVER since the war through which we lost our colonies it has become the the fashion in Spain to speak of the need of reforming public instruction ; people insist on the great number of those who can neither read nor write ? half the adult population of the country ? and the schoolmaster , a generally most neglected entity , has acquired great importance . Nevertheless , all this is more in the word than in the feeling . The State , yielding to this tendency , principally manifested in the daily press and the reviews , has finally decided to take upon itself the payment of all the charges for primary instruction , which were formerly looked after by the respective municipal corporations . In pursuance of the above , since the beginning of the present year , the Government has decided that there shall be no school with less than $100 appropriation per annum ; but the rural villages in general look upon this unfavorably , claiming that their poverty does not allow them to contribute such a large sum of money to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the country does not want public instruction created great scandal among the " intellectuals " in Spain , but all those who , like myself , are in a position to know the feeling of the people , aside from the opin-  | ion of the " intellectuals , " know how truthful , unfortunately , is that asserion . Among the rural families the children are in many cases simply retained at home and never sent to school ; they are made to mind their younger brothers and sisters , or employed in household duties or agricultural work . The school at best is considered as a place where the children are kept locked up and prevented from tearing their clothes or damaging the newly planted fields . In a certain little village where the people refused to improve the conditions of the schoolhouse , unhealthy and too small for its purpose , they argued to me in reply to the teacher 's complaints : " The good woman pretends to love our children even better than we love them ourselves ! It does not matter whether she teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mischief . During these days , when , under pretense of unhealthy conditions , she has kept the school closed , my son has actually torn two pairs of boots ; and matters can not go on like this . " People have no belief in public instruction in this country and far less in hygiene . The need of public instruction has not penetrated into the soul of our rural population , nor that of soap either . If they seem to acquiesce in either case it is because they dare not contradict what they hear so highly praised . In the matter of learning itself , it is their firm belief that the poor man has quite enough if he knows how to read and write , the four elementary operations of arithmetic ( adding , subtracting , multiplying and dividing ) and , above all , the Catechism or Manual of Christian doctrine and sacred history . Anything beyond that is not only superfluous , but may be harmful . " Send us a teacher who will teach the Christian Catechism well , and who on Sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may teach nothing else ; for that is quite sufficient here , " so I was told by the worthies of a village . I know of a certain bishop who upheld the above theory in talking to a school teacher upon whom he called during one of his episcopal rounds . There are many among us who believe that the " poor in spirit " who shall be " blessed " are the ignorant , and it is not rare to hear ignorance defended in one shape or another as the great bulwark against liberalism , which is a sin , at least in Spain . The worst is that the clergy do not comply with their orders according to which Spanish priests should attend the schools every Saturday to teach the Catholic faith to the children . Very few of them do this , leaving the work to the teacher , whom they blame and even actively molest and persecute if he does not give the teaching to their satisfacion . The Church , out of which sprang our universities , hardly pays any direct attention in Spain to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious orders , which have practically become the sole masters of secondary education , of a great part of the primary education in the large cities , and also of a considerable part of the higher education . Within recent times some of their privileges have been curtailed . Those who give private instruction have been compelled to show that they possess sufficient academic titles . They pretend to take their pupils to the official examinations , but they have these examinations conducted by the pupils ' own teachers . They have now been compelled to take their pupils to the official institutions to be examined there , instead of having it done by official commissions sent to the private colleges , as was formerly the case , which lent itself to great abuse . Speaking with all frankness , it is necessary to declare that the education given by the religious orders in Spain is , generally speaking , detestable ; that it aims solely at educating the pupils in external religious practices , and at guarding them from contamination with the liberal virus , while carrying out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally institutions for the production of academic bachelors , whose work is carried out with no other end in view but the honorary degree which they may obtain from the institution itself . And that is very natural . The Spanish Church has always distrusted the education of the people . seeking to prevent its overstepping certain limits . We have with us an inherent Inquisition , as it were . There is in the most popular Catechism of Christian Doctrine , the one written by Father Astete , a reply to a certain question which is most significant :  | " Do not ask that question of me , who am an ignorant man ; the Holy Mother , the Catholic Church , has doctors who will be able to answer . " That is the national leprosy which afflicts us : everything is delegated . From no quarter do we hear with greater frequency than from the clerical element that " the shoemaker should stick to his last . " They see an enemy in any one who , going beyond the strict limits of his professional studies required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him not . " A physician who abandons his practice and devotes his time to biological investigation , a lawyer who studies sociology , incites suspicion . I know of a university professor , an Ultramontane , who , when a psychological experimental laboratory was started at the university , declared that such a thing was nefarious and sure to lead to materialism . Not long ago the Bishop of Guadix protested in the Senate against the taking of anthropometric measurements of the pupils in a gymnasium on the ground that it was contrary to human dignity : so he said , but the real fact at the basis of all this is that they see a danger to Spanish orthodoxy in any class of investigations . For the above reasons I have always believed that what I will call the practicism preached by so many Liberals , ever since our military disasters , is at heart a weapon unwittingly placed in the hands of the reactionaries . " What is required , " so we are told , " is less graduates or doctors , and more men versed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teaching institutions than at present , and more commercial or industrial and engineering schools . " For my part I believe that it is not the industrial schools that create industry , but that the latter creates the schools , and that our industrial schools will only give us industrial graduates like the others , or worse than those . I believe , furthermore , that it is the mind that we should educate and elevate in Spain , not delegating everything , but , on the contrary , " meddling with what concerns us not , " and that we shall have neither industry , nor commerce , nor roads , nor irrigation , until we shall have shaken off the spirit of the Inquisition and shall have arrived at the Peace of Westphalia , having passed before through our Diet of Worms and the wars consequent thereon . The fact is that the religious struggle has not come to an end in Spain , but that , on the contrary , it has to-day as much as , or greater importance than the economical and social problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of an armed civil peace , but open warfare would be preferable , as pneumonia is preferable to consumption . The liberty of the human conscience is at stake in Spain ; the fullness of that liberty remains still to be conquered , and the question presents itself specially in matters appertaining to public instruction , the legal status of which is ambiguous . The Concordat signed in March , 1851 , between his holiness Pius IX and her majesty Queen Isabella II , which is in force at present , stipulates in its Article 2 : " The instruction given at the universities , colleges , seminaries and public and private schools , of any class whatsoever , shall be in strict conformity in all its details with the doctrine of the Catholic religion , and for this purpose no obstacle shall be set to the bishops or other diocesan prelates intrusted by their ministry to watch over the purity of the doctrine of the faith and morals of the people , and over the religious education of the young , in the exercise of their duties , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Law of Public Instruction of 1857 , which is the one in force , stipulates that " the academic functionaries shall not put any obstacle to prevent the bishops from inspecting the doctrines that may be taught , " and " whenever a diocesan prelate shall find in the text books or in the explanations of the professors the utterance of doctrines prejudicial to the sound religious education of the young " he will report the matter to the Government , so that the latter may take the required proceedings . Later on , the Constitution of 1876 , which rules in Spain to-day , declared in Article 2 : " No one shall be molested in the territory of Spain for reason of his religious opinions , nor for the exercise of the religion , provided the due observance of Christian morality be maintained . " In Article 13 the Constitution establishes that every Spaniard has the right to the free utterance of his ideas and opinions , spoken or written .  | Before the promulgation of that Constitution , in February , 1875 , immediately after the restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ordered that no other teaching but the official teaching of the State should be given by the professors , in consequence of which several professors were deprived of their chairs . Orovio was a Conservative . On March 3d , 1881 , the Liberals being in office , the then Minister , Senor Albareda , canceled the inquisitorial decree of his predecessor , Orovio , and reinstated the deposed professors , paying them their salaries during the time of their enforced absence . Thus the precedent of the freedom of the academic chair was established ; it holds up to the present day and has managed to resist since then the attacks of the clerical element . I say up to the present , because in Spain no one can answer for what the morrow will bring ; no one can say if some Government will not take it into its head to revive the Concordat and the Law of Public Instruction , both of which are extant , acting against the Constitution itself , and to argue that , altho every Spaniard has the right to profess and expound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State can not retain in the academic chairs as official professors , paid out of the public moneys , those who may expound doctrines contrary to what is stated to be the doctrine of the State itself . In fact , it is not so much the Constitution as the public spirit that prevents in Spain such an enormous outrage and the resurrection of such obsolete principles . The immense majority of the nation , composed of illiterates or little better than that , does not think for itself and has no opinion on religion , education or politics ; it delegates them . It is a minority , and a very small minority at that , which constitutes the conscience of the nation and also constitutes public opinion . To ask to hear what the majority has to say , instead of simply limiting one 's self to the stating of what that majority needs , would be as if a veterinary surgeon waited for the ass to bray before medicating it . The majority of that conscious minority is Liberal in its tendencies and scarcely orthodox , tho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preservation of appearances . It must be confessed , however , that the majority of Spanish university professors do not belong to the enlightened Liberal minority , and that it is in the State universities principally where are to be found , outside of the clergy , the intellectual elements of strict orthodoxy and anti-Liberalism . But it must also be confessed that the best and most distinguished representation of Spanish intellect is not to be found among the official professors , but outside of their number , principally in the press , in that press so hateful to the clerical elements , and upon which the Universitarians of the old school look with such unfavorable eyes . Tho with great difficulty , dragged , as it were , our universities and institutions wil ) have to follow the current of the century , and cease to be academic factories of bachelors and doctors , to become centers of supreme culture and laboratories of real learning . Our most liberal university , that of Oviedo , is the one most advanced in the new direction , thanks to the nucleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diocese , a Dominican friar , urges constant war , having founded a daily newspaper for the principal purpose of combating those professors . The religious orders teach , because they have to take their pupils to be examined at the official centers , and in competition with these latter . If , freed from official competition , the religious orders were to become sole masters of education , everything would come to an end . Under the pretense of teaching , only the most summary education would be given , and we would enter fully into the period of " Ask not such questions of me who am an ignorant man , for the Church has doctors , " etc. ; a brutifying praticism would prevail over the land . Bad as it is , the official instruction given by the State is to-day in Spain the only thing that deserves the name of instruction . All true Spanish Liberals understand that we must raise the flag in the battle for national culture in the " Kulturkampf. "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
