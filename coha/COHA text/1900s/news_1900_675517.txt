txt The meeting of the State Committee , which was called for S o'clock , sent the delegates trooping toward the ballroom of the Grand Union Hotel . The general impression seemed to prevail that there was going to be a merry war there between Mr. Croker and Mr. Hill . The news had not been generally disseminated that Mr. Hill had decided that it would be impossible for him to go into the State Committee on a proxy and raise a fighting issue which would result in his certain defeat and accomplish no purpose that he will not be able to accomplish more fully on the convention floor . The meeting was opened , and the big ballroom was crowded with all sorts of Tammany men . Everybody was talking and smoking , even while the meeting was in progress . The meeting was almost a perfunctory affair , run on lines agreed upon by the bosses during the afternoon . The roll was called , the contests noted , and the routine business transacted . When it came to the matter of naming a temporary Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be Patrick H. McCarren  --  Elliot Danforth , supposed to tie Mr. Hill 's stanchest adherent , got up and moved the nomination of Mr. McCarren . There was no other candidate , and Senator McCarren was unanimously agreed upon . Why Mr. Danforth , who at the previous meeting of the State Committee had at Hill 's bidding presented the name of Mayor of Syracuse for temporary Chairman , should here move the nomination of Senator McCarren , was something that nobody seemed to understand , except Mr. Croker and other big bosses , and their faces expressed no surprise . Everybody was asking whether even Danforth had been won over by the **28;0;TOOLONG combination . Mr. Danforth was . asked what he meant by making the nomination , and his reply was : DANFORTH GIVES HIS REASONS . " Well , somebody had to make- it . " " But are you bidding for harmony with the enemy ? " was asked . " Oh , I 'm a harmonizer , you know , " he said . " But have you deserted Senator Hill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no , no , " he said . " You 'll find me on the convention floor where I have been all along , for Mr. Coler for Governor . " Senator Hill is either one of the best actors in the world or else he was most genuinely surprised and disgusted when he was informed that Mr. Danforth had put in nomination the name of Senator McCarren for temporary Chairman . " Why , did n't he let them make the nomination ? ' he said , with a show of anger . " Why should he put McCarren in nomination for them ? Why did he do it ? Oh , I suppose they asked him to . Do I think he did it purely out of good-nature ? I do n't know . I will have to find out about it . " It was the common talk around the Grand Union Hotel after the meeting that the true reason for Mr. Danforth 's action was that both he and State Chairman Campbell had been reached by the **28;30;TOOLONG combine . This rumor may have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seeking conferences I with the leaders of the enemy throughout the day . They even went to Mr. Hill for advice as to what should be done in the event of Mr. Hill 's being sent for to confer with the **28;60;TOOLONG faction , and they seemed a bit perturbed when Mr. Hill replied that that was a con ' tingency which need not be dealt with , as he would not be drawn into any conference under existing conditions . CHOKER AS AN ALTERNATE . The State Committee adjourned to meet at 6 o'clock to-morrow night , which shows clearly that the **28;90;TOOLONG forces are not yet in a position to close their dealings and transact the business of the convention . They still hope to bring a pressure to bear upon Mr. Hill 's friends which will make them bring Mr. Hill to terms . They do not want a fight on the convention floor . Richard Croker attended the meeting of the State Committee as a proxy for " Larry " Delmour . " If you do n't mind , I will go to the meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Delmour . " I think I can trust you to do the right thing , " said Delmour , with mock dignity . " All right , I wo n't betray you , " said Croker with a laugh . START FOR THE CONVENTION .

Only once did Mr. Coler make any reference to politics , and that was when he told the young men that they had no right to call themselves American citizens unless they attended the primaries and assisted in the promotion of good citizenship . He said he got into'politics in that way , and he intended to remain in because an effort was being made to drive him out . SERVES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machine Men . James- R. Brown , Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Chicago Platform Democracy , declared yesterday that his organization would not support the candidate of the Saratoga Convention for Governor if he should be a man identified with the machine . He added : " The Chicago Platform Democracy will not support a candidate for Governor whose course in the campaign of 1896 will have to be explained . The Democrats of New York State demand the nomination of a man who is thoroughly honest , one who supported Mr. Bryan four years ago , and one who is not so closely identified with the organization as to be known as a machine man . If the Democrats at Saratoga nominate an objectionable man the Chicago Platform Democracy will place an independent.candidate in the field . We have enough votes to spoil any . plot the Croker-Murphy combination may hatch . " Mr. Brown added that his organization would not support- John B. Stanchfield . " In the first place , " said he , " Mr. Stanchfield is a machine man ; then his attitude in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is a corporation lawyer and identified with corporations ' in other respects . " Mr. Brown said that the Chicago Platform Democracy would support either Controller Color or . Mayor James IC of Syracuse .
