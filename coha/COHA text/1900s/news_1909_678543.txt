txt A few months ago ' it seemed that nothing more was necessary to make all Texas happy than to expel the subsidiary of the Standard Oil Trust from the State , but the course of events proves once more that " Man never is but always to be blest . " The sickening fact is that the sovereign State of Texas demeans itself rather worse than the Waters-Pierce Company . There is no record that sellers of crude oil get a cent more for their raw material , but it is sure that buyers of . refined are paying more . As soon as the trust 's competition ceased the independent refiners raised their price 2 cents . This seemed like taking liberties with the people of the State of Texas , not to mention the receiver who was operating the trust plant on behalf of the State , but no resentment was shown . On the contrary , the receiver promptly advanced his price to the same level , just in the manner which causes railways and other restrainers of trade to be prosecuted for conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well content with profits- of 40 per cent . a year upon the unwatered price paid for the plant when the tryst was expelled . It might be thought that this would undeceive the Texans , but they harden their hearts and propose to see the matter through . The property is to be sold again , since the State does not wish to remain in tkig oil business permanently , but it is announced that no independent Texas Company will be allowed to bid , nor any company suspected of connection with the hated trust , which sold oil so cheaply and paid prices so high to sellers of crude oil thatsit was-disliked by all . A former citizen of this town , and one capable of arousing much interest in his business operations , is preparing to bid , and has begun to qualify by riding himself of all business connections which would bar him under the conditions of sale . No other bidder in sight has anything like his resources , and It is said that his first act after buying the property will be to combine it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about where she was before she expelled the hated trust . This experience is so closely like ' so many others that the temptation is irresistible to ask , " What 's the use ? "
