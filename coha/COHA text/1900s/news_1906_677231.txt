txt That the Rev. Dr. Thomas a Slicer of New York and Bishop Doane of Albany are opposed to the bill introduced into the Senate by Senator Cassidy declaring poolselling and bookmaking on the race tracks in the State a felony was the startling proposition put forward at the hearing on the bill to-day before the Joint Committee on Codes by Joseph S. Auerbach , counsel for The Jockey Club . Mr. Auerbach stated that he had visited Dr. Slicer in New York after he had come out in advocacy of the bill , and that as a result of that visit Dr. Slicer had changed his position , and that he had even gone BO far as to write to Bishop Doane , advising him that after an investigation he ( Dr. Slicer ) had come to the conclusion that vicious interests were behind the Cassidy bill ; in short , that poolroom men favored it . This , counsel said , caused , Bishop Doane to withdraw from the Rev. Dr. Gregg a letter he had written to him advocating the passage of the bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Wilbur F. Crafts , who had the bill drawn and induced Senator Cassidy to present it as his own . The Rev. Dr. Crafts said that he was surprised that the avowed advocate of the professional gamblers would admit that he had won over Dr. Slicer . " Auerbach upset Slicer and Slicer upset the Bishop , " he said . " I am sure that in time they will see that they have both been bunkoed , and will be sorry for their change of heart . When a man has no case he abuses the plaintiff 's attorney . " When there was some litigation before , " said Dr. Crafts , " and the racetrack people were as desperate as they are now , they hired Mr. Pinkerton to see If he could not find some connection between me and the half-mile race track men . I challenged him then to produce any proof he might have , and he could not do it . I challenge him again , or any of the other gamblers in view of the innuendoes that the poolroom men are behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Auerbach , speaking for the race track people , contended that Me PercyDray law limited gambling and kept it within certain bounds , where it could be watched . He said that the courts had passed on the constitutionality of the law that bettine at the race course was merely Inc:der:La , 0 die Industry and diversion of horse breeding and racing , that the stopping of the bookmaking would be wholly ineffectual to stop gambling , and that as the present racing laws of the State has stimulated large property interests to large investments the Legislature had no right to interfere with the vested rights it had fostered . Mr. Auerbach quoted the litigation begun by De Lacy and the poolroom men , and dwelt on the alleged collusion In those actions . He left the inference that he ccnsidered the present agitation of the same kind , but when Senator Cassidy heatedly demanded that he make himself clear on that point Mr. Auerbach declared that he had meant nothing of the kind . Mr. . Auerbach then quoted a number of prominent sociological writers on gambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If writers took one side and the Constitution of the State took the other , which would you agree with ? " " I 'll think that over and perhaps answer it later , " said Mr. Auterbach . " On the whole I do n't think that I should be interrupted by any one not on the committee . Because Senator Cassidy was a member of the Constitutional Convention he need not think he knows it all . Elihu Root and De Lancey Nicoll were also members of that convention , and yet they have helped me in the preparation of cases favoring - the Percy-Gray law . " Senator Cassidy , his face blazing , jumped to his feet . " This gentleman has seen fit to make invidious comparisons , " he said , " and I want to say in reply that the position of Mr , Root as a paid advocate of the gamblers does not square with his opinions in the convention . " Mr. Auerbach then addressed his remarks to showing that large vested ' interests had grown up under the present law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in conditions , had no right to interfere with those rights . A number of representatives of agricultural societies which get about $200,000 a year from the race track receipts said the fairs would have to close unless they got money from some source , either the State or the tracks , and Senator Elsberg , Chairman of the committee , asked if it made any difference to them where the money came from . Most of them answered that if the money was tainted they would take it , but preferred to take it without taint if they could get it . The Rev. Dr. Crafts then described the conditions at race tracks as he had seen them . When Senator Cassidy rose to speak Senator McCarren asked him if he thought that putting a stop to betting at the tracks would make any difference in the attendance . " If the race tracks are run for the gambler it would , " was the reply : " but if they are run to improve the breed of horses and furnish honest sport and amusement , it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertions that they were running their tracks to improve the breed of horses , then they would not oppose this bill , which simply hits at race track gambling and upholds the Constitution of the State . I do not think that this bill will stop gambling . That will go on so long as the human race survives , but I stand here to break the partnership of the great Empire State with the gamblers . If they do wrong I want them to do it as outlaws and not under the form of law of this state . " DE LACY 'S BILL  --  SLICER . He Says the Cassidy Bill Would Open Poolrooms the Wider . The Rev. Dr. Thomas R. Slicer said last night that he was quoted correctly when he was declared by Mr. Auerbach to be against the bill prohibiting race-track letting . " The bill , " he said , " emanates from the De Lacy gang . It is intended to open Wider the poolrooms of New York , which are already open and doing business . If Sports are left in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsible men , then some one can be held **33;485;TOOLONG any law . of gambling , of course , but I am rn favor of putting the control of all sports in the hands of responsible men to the end that they may be kept clean . If the bill should ' become a law , it would mean more pool-j ' rooms for New York . "
