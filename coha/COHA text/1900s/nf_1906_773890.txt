txt CHAPTER III WATER , TEA , COFFEE , COCOA I N importance to health second only to pure air is the quality of the water drunk . It may even be considered as a food , for there is at least a probability that its office in the system is more than that of a regulator of temperature and a diluent of the blood . From a sanitary point of view , next in importance to the quality of the water used is that of the other liquids which are more and more frequently substituted for it , namely , tea , coffee , and cocoa . Beer and wine are neither foods nor necessary beverages in this land of good water and cheap coffee , hence they are not here considered . V TER By far the largest quantity of any one thing taken into the system through the mouth is water . The average person drinks whatever is most convenient , yet only in the large cities with a carefully guarded water supply is this safe .

It seems to be assumed that all clear , cold water comes from a great depth and is therefore pure . Only in the case of driven wells , where a small pipe is driven down to a known distance , or in the case of the true artesian wells , which deliver water in great force without pumping , is this true . The ordinary shallow well , thirty feet or so deep , is usually fed , in whole or in part , from near-by sources and is always an object of suspicion . Such water , unless tested by a reliable expert , should be boiled before drinking , as should water taken from rivers and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of a safe supply for the community , instead of each one depending on his own well or cistern . These are often sources of danger . But the housewife will ask , " Is not the use of filters better than depending on boiled water ? " A coarse filter will take out coarse material such as comes from heavy rains , from growths of a/go , from rusting pipes , etc , but it requires porous porcelain or sandstone to take out excessively fine material such as bacteria . This means very slow action and soon a clogged surface . Rapid filters are all merely strainers . A flannel bag tied on the faucet and washed every day will serve for this as well as any expensive mechanical device . The bone black filters will take out color , but color is not the dangerous factor , and the water is rendered // harder by the lime phosphate . All strainers collect the insoluble material that they remove and should be thoroughly cleaned , else they are worse than nothing . All tale filters act slowly and deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that the New Hampshire State Board of Health in its July Bulletin , 1906 , gives an illustration of a household filter , with full directions for construction and use , which has considerable merit ; but , like all good things , " it demands intelligent supervision , and the occasional attention prompted by a proper understanding of what it is and what it ought to do from clay to day . " The author wishes to impress upon her readers , even to their weariness , that the best things are not obtained by machinery . Very few things are really automatic . Somewhere there must be a mind in control , a watchful eye to see the beginnings of failure to work . Let the housekeeper once again learn the pleasure of power over things , of knowledge of constituents and durability , feel once more the delight of invention , and see the work of her mind as well as of her hands grow before her eyes . A serious danger to the public lies in impure wells on dairy farms . Milk cans washed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , the practice of using the well as an ice box can not be too strongly reprehended . The first essential in establishing a new home is , then , clean , safe water . The services of an expert must be secured if there is doubt . Towns and villages are // beginning to appreciate the fact that property is worth more where this satisfaction may be felt . One simple , popular test which may serve to detect harmful materials in water is as follows : Place a pint of clear well or spring water in a clean , white , uncracked dish on the stove . If , on evaporation , the water leaves dark rings on the dish , or a dark sediment in the bot tom , there is positive evidence of danger . If , on the other hand , there is no sediment , we have no proof that the water is safe . This test does not apply to surface waters , which always contain harmless organic matter . TEA In regard to tea and coffee more than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the differences in quality , caused solely by methods of preparation , but often attributed to adulteration . Therefore space is here given to the principles of obtaining satisfactory results in the home . The tea plant , There Sinensis , or Camellia Thor , an evergreen , is a native of China , Japan , and the north of Eastern India , and has been there cultivated from time immemorial . The finest tea of China is grown between the twenty-seventh and thirty-first parallels of north latitude But the plant will flourish from the equator to forty degrees north latitude . Tea has been used as a beverage by the Chinese for ages past . Tradition refers to it as early as the third century . It first became known to Europeans about the end of the sixteenth century . Until the middle of the seventeenth , the price was from twentyfive to fifty dollars a pound ; and a remarkable feature // in its history is the reduction which has taken place in its commercial value , tea now being sold at Canton at from fifteen to twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five cents to one dollar . Tea is used at present by about one-third of the human race . The consumption in Great Britain in 1835 was less than one and a half pounds a head . In 1877 it was four and a half pounds , and in 1904 Six pounds . In the United States in 1876 it was one and a half pounds . In 1904 it was about one and a quarter pounds . Among European nations tea is preeminently an English , Russian , and Dutch drink . The quality of tea depends upon its flavor , which should be delicate and yet full ; and this is affected by the time of gathering ( whether or not the first of the four yearly gatherings ) , by the age of the tree , by the country in which it is grown , by the quality of the soil , and by the situation of the plantation . The two classes of tea , the black and the green , are produced in the same region and often from the same trees . Green tea is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished in an hour or two , so that the leaf keeps its color . The idea that green tea is obtained by drying the leaves in copper pans is a popular error , which has been persisted in for a long time , without a shadow of truth for its foundation . For black tea , the leaves are beaten and exposed to the air for some time , so that a sort of fermentation sets in . The production of the aromatic flavors is due to the processes of ( Trying , since the leaves when freshly plucked have neither the odor nor flavor of the dried leaves . Hence different // qualities of tea may be made from the same leaves , according to the treatment while drying . This is the source of the various kinds found in the market under the , names Hyson , Oolong , etc . Some teas are scented with fragrant leaves and flowers . Substitutes for tea are found in nearly every country . Sage leaves were frequently so used in England a century ago . Labrador tea was prepared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known to have been thus used . The important constituent of tea is an alkaloid called theinc . It is present in varying proportions , from i to 4 per cent . The theine is supposed to be in combination with tannin , which is the most abundant soluble substance in tea , usually from 16 to 27 per cent . To the tannin is due the constipating effect of tea . The longer the tea leaves are steeped , the more tannin the solution contains . Regard for the lining of one 's stomach would lead one to avoid all steeped teas . The infusion should be prepared immediately before drinking , or removed from contact with the leaves . The odor and flavor of tea are due to an essential oil which is present in very small quantity , and which is developed during the fermenting and drying . For a good tea the volatile oil must not escape . To make a good pot of tea , scald out the pot with boiling hot soft water , place the tea in it as soon as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot immediately ; allow it to stand in a hot place for a few minutes , but do not let it boil ; if the tea leaves are put in a bag or ball they may be at once withdrawn . Tea // as drunk in China is always taken clear , without any addition of milk or sugar . The Russians add a few drops of lemon . Lo-Yu , a learned Chinese who lived about 700 A.D. , says of the effect of an infusion of tea , that it tempers the spirits and harmonizes the mind , dispels lassitude and relieves fatigue , awakens thought and prevents drowsiness , lightens or refreshes the body , and clears the perceptive faculties . Modern writers claim that tea excites the brain to increased activity , while it soothes and stills the vascular system ; hence its use in inflammatory diseases and as a cure for headache . Taken in excess it has the effect of a vegetable-poison . It affects different people differently , and when it causes nervous excitement its use should be avoided . The in-fusion is stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toast , so common among the workingwomen of America , is very poor economy , and is an evil , one had almost said , second only to the use of alcohol . Indeed , it has been called the tobacco of women ; for while the tea does undoubtedly allow one to live on less food , it does not supply the place of food for any length of time . If the exhausted leaves were eaten after the infusion was drunk , as is the case in several countries , it would be more economical , since they con-tain about 20 per cent of nitrogenous matter , insoluble n water . On the coast of South America and on the slopes of the IIimalayas the spent leaves are handed ound among the company , sometimes on a silver salver , and much relished . In some places the leaves arc pow-dered and mixed with various nutritious substances , anp eaten without infusion. // According to the best authorities tea should not be drunk as a beverage by persons under middle age , as it is liable to interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicate people whose stomachs are incapable of digesting much food the use of tea is often valuable , as it , like coffee , prevents the waste of tissue , or , in other words , a person requires less food when tea is taken ; but it should not be used for this purpose by working people , since it tells upon the digestive power of the stomach , and nothing can supply day after day the lack of nutritious food . Physicians now recognize a tea dyspepsia , and no one with a hope for better digestion should drink tea constantly three times a clay . ADULTERATIONS OF TEA When tea was ten dollars a pound there was great temptation to mix other leaves with the genuine , or even to substitute them entirely ; also to add to the weight by iron filings , etc , or sand gummed on plumbago and soapstone ; the exhausted leaves were also used . since the price has fallen , very much less adulteration is practiced . It will not pay to work over the tea leaves to any extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue to carelessness in preparation and to less careful cultivation are often found The most common method of adulteration is by " facing , " that is , by treating with certain coloring materials to give intensity to the color of the leaves . The facings in most general use are Prussian blue , // indigo , plumbago , and turmeric , often accompanied by such minerals as gypsum and soapstone . According to Leach ' the Chinese and Japanese face only the teas intended for export trade . The addition of mineral matter may be detected by burning a weighed quantity ? one gram or more ? in a platinum dish , and weighing the ash . Good tea gives from 5 to 7 per cent of ash . If the leaves are exhausted , the per cent will be less . To ascertain the strength of the tea , an infusion is the best test . If the decoction is very high-colored , the tea has probably been doctored . If there is not much extract , the leaves have been exhausted . The surest test of this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a deli-cate test , since the specific gravity of a solution of 200 grains of tea in 2,000 grains of water is from 1.012 to 1.014 , while that of exhausted leaves is from 1.003 to 1.0057 . Good tea should yield 26 per cent , and often as much as 36 per cent , of its weight to boiling water . Spent or exhausted leaves , leaves that have been once steeped and afterwards again rolled and dried , have been used as an adulterant , though the practice is now rare . Certain foreign leaves , as the leaves of the willow , elder , rose , elm , etc , have been said to be used as adulterants . Stems , fragments , and tea dust are sometimes found in large proportion . " As a matter of fact , the worst forms of tea adul-teration , such as the actual substitution of foreign // leaves , once so commonly practiced , are now extremely rare in this country and have been for some years , by reason of the careful system of government inspection in force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tea on our market today is genuine , but fraud is practiced to a considerable extent by the substitution of inferior grades for those of good quality . This form of deception is in many cases beyond the power of the analyst to detect , and properly comes within the realm of the professional tea taster . " ' Tea tablets are made of finely ground tea pressed together , and are prepared for a beverage by simply dissolving in hot water . The analysis of the Samovar Tea Tablets , according to the Massachusetts State Board of Health , is as follows : In England all tea is sampled and inspected , and in 1879 , of 575 specimens examined , only three were found to require special disposal ? one damaged by water , one consisting of exhausted leaves , and one sanded.2 // The Russians are said to have the most delicious tea of any nation in Europe . They have an inland trade with China , and choice teas are directly imported , without exposure to the heat and close air of the hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor . Their method of making tea also has much to do with its fine flavor , and samovars are a national feature , from which some lessons may be learned . The samovar is a large brass urn , lined with block tin . The urn and the stand which raises it from the table are all in one piece , in those I have seen . The urns hold from four to eight quarts of water , which is poured in through a small hole , three quarters of an inch in diameter , in the top , and they are emptied by a stopcock or faucet , like any hot water urn . It is usually one servant 's duty in Russia to take care of the samovar , to fill it with the freshest of water , to kindle the fire , and to bring it in when all is ready for the table . A twist of paper is placed in the bottom of the cylinder , with some splinters of kindling wood . Upon this is placed charcoal broken into pieces the size of walnuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cocoanuts , the hard shells making a very dense , odorless charcoal , which gives off an intense heat . The fire is lighted from the grate below . The chimney is put on , and the fire is allowed to burn until all smoke and smell from the wood and paper have passed away , and the charcoal is in a glow . Then it is carried in and set upon the table . As soon as the water sends out a jet of steam from // the hole at the top , beside the cylinder , the tea is made by the hostess . Now notice that the water has just reached the boiling point . It has lost none of its life or air . It is simply fresh , pure water brought to the boiling point . The teapot is made scalding hot , and the tea is taken from a caddy upon the table . At first only a little water is poured upon it . The chimney is taken off and the teapot is set upon the cylinder over the glowing coals , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boiling teakettle on the fire , as we often see done here in our kitchens . In a few moments more boiling water is added , and the teapot replaced over the coals . The tea is poured into the cups when it has steeped sufficiently long , sugar is added , and instead of cream a slice of lemon is slipped into each cup . Fresh tea and water are put in the teapot , and it is again placed over the coals . COFFEE One tradition relates that , in ancient days , a poor dervish , who lived in a valley of Arabia Felix , observed a strange hilarity in his goats on their return home every evening . To find out the cause of this , he watched them closely one day , and observed that they eagerly devoured the blossoms and fruit of a tree he had hitherto disregarded . He tried the effect of this food upon himself , and was thrown into such a state of exhilaration that his neighbors accused him of having drunk of the forbidden wine ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed that Allah had sent the coffee plant to the faithful as a substitute for the wine . // The name of coffee is given to a beverage prepared from the seeds of plants , which are roasted , ground , and infused in boiling water . The seeds most used are those of the Arabian coffee tree ( an evergreen , Caffea Arabica ) , which belongs to the natural order Cinclzonacece , the same order to which belongs the tree from which are obtained quinine and the Peruvian bark of commerce . It is probable that the use of coffee has been known from time immemorial in Abyssinia , where the tree is native . In Persia it is known to have been in use as early as A.D. 875 . The first allusion to coffee in an English book is believed to be in Burton 's " Anatomy of Melancholy " : " The Turks have a drink called coffee ( for they use no wine ) , so named of a berry as black as soot , and as bitter , which they sup up as warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that kind of drink , so used , helpeth digestion and produceth alacrity . " The introduction of coffee into Europe was bitterly opposed , and the use of it denounced from the pulpit . Nevertheless the tree has been cultivated in all tropical countries which have been colonized by Europeans . While in Mohammedan countries its use as an anti , soporific in the long devotional exercises rendered it obnoxious to the conservative priests , and " while some held it to be an intoxicant , and so prohibited by the Koran , in England it seems to have been op. posed by liquor dealers , who alleged that the popularity of the coffee houses was so great as to draw away their custom . The popularity of the coffee houses // also aroused suspicion of disloyalty in the gatherings , so that they were made the object of a royal proclamation by Charles II in 1675 . Coffee was introduced into England at about the same time as tea , and its use increased very rapidly , until it reached its maximum in 1854 , when the import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption has decreased , partly owing to a greater use of tea , and partly to the increase of coffee substitutes . The amount used in Great Britain in 1857 was one and a quarter pounds a head ; in 1875 ? 77 threequarters of a pound ; in 1904 only three-fifths . In Holland and Germany in 1885 about fourteen pounds a head were consumed ; in 1904 less than seven pounds . In the United States the amount was in 1885 about eight pounds ; in 1904 it was twelve pounds , and the United States consumed about half the total supply of the world . Brazil now supplies more than one-half of the coffee of the world , and nearly 75 per cent of that used in the United States . The most valuable constituent of coffee is caffeine , an alkaloid identical with the theine of tea . There is present about 1 per cent of it . The peculiar flavor and aroma of coffee are due to one or more oils or fats , which become changed to peculiar aromatic compounds in the roasting . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably possess the stimulating properties noticed in the infusion . Caffeic acid , an astringent somewhat like the tannin of tea , is present , but only from 3 to 5 per cent . Hence the action // of coffee is not as deleterious to the coatings of the stomach as is that of tea . Coffee also contains sugar to 5 or 7 per cent , which is all converted into caramel in roasting . The exhausted berries also contain nutritious nitrogenous matter , and some Eastern nations drink grounds and all . In Sumatra the leaves are used , and seem to have a large proportion of the properties of the berry . The effect of coffee on the human system is to counteract the tendency to sleep , and it is almost certain that it was this property which originally led to its use as a beverage . It also excites the nervous system , and when taken in excess produces contractions and tremors of the muscles , and a feeling of buoyancy and exhilaration somewhat similar to that produced by alcohol , but does not end with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effects of coffee : " It exhilarates , arouses , and keeps awake ; it counteracts the stupor occasioned by fatigue , by disease , or opium ; it allays hunger to a certain extent ; it gives to the weary increased strength and vigor , and imparts a feeling of comfort and repose . " Its physiological effects upon the system , so far as they have been investigated , appear to be that , while it makes the brain more active , it soothes the body generally , makes the change and waste of matter slower , and the demand for food in consequence less . For soldiers and travelers exposed to great hardships , coffee is the best agent known for restoration of the exhausted energies . Its use can be abused , like // that of any other good thing , but , used understandingly , coffee is an important addition to one 's diet . There are few adulterants in whole coffee , though , as in the case of teas , inferior qualities are often sub stituted for the choicer varieties . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of paper pulp deserves attention . Glazing is the process of coating the coffee beans with white of egg or sugar , or with one of a variety of gums . This is ostensibly for the better preservation of the coffee , and for the purpose of saving the house-wife the trouble of clarifying her own coffee . It may be questioned , however , whether the process is not for the purpose of deceiving the housewife with the sub stitution of an inferior bean for a better quality . If this is the case , then certainly glazing is a form of adulteration . Ground coffee is variously adulterated . In Massa chusetts the following adulterants have been found : roasted peas , beans , wheat , rye , oats , chicory , brown bread , pilot bread , charcoal , red slate , bark , and dried pellets made of ground peas , pea hulls , and cereals , held together with molasses . Of the ninety e mples examined by the Massachu setts Board of Health in 1905 only four were found to be adulterated . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of chicory in coffee is considered by many connoisseurs to impart a particularly agree-able flavor , and consequently its use is not condemned . // The difficulty about sanctioning such a mixture is that if you give a man an inch he will take an ell , and in the end chicory may be the chief constituent . Here again enters in the problem of injury to morals and loss to pocketbooks , and of the need for protection against " swindling . " Villiers and Collin 1 give the following analyses of two samples of chicory : As yet there has been no seed found which , when roasted and ground , corresponds with coffee , either in its physiological properties or in the chemical composition . The detection of the presence of chicory , caramel , and some of the sweet roots , as turnips , carrots , and parsnips , is quite easy . If a few grains of the sus-pected sample are placed on the surface of water in a // glass vessel , beaker , or tumbler , each particle of chicory , etc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffuses through the water until the whole becomes colored . Pure coffee , under the same conditions , gives no sensible color to the water until after the lapse of about fifteen minutes . Caramel ( burnt sugar ) of course colors the water very deeply . Dandelion root gives a deeper color than coffee , but not as deep as chicory ; this is true of bread raspings . The first two adulterations may be more readily detected by the taste , and the bread by its softening . Beans and peas give much less color to the water than pure coffee ; they can be readily detected by the microscope , as can roasted figs and dates , or date stones . But the use of the microscope is not to be learned in one lesson , and the microscopical examination must be made by one who has skill . In months of practice one sees more and more each time the instrument is used , so that , while it is an invaluable aid to those accustomed to its use , it is as unreliable as the chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good coffee requires only an understanding of its properties , and is not as difficult or as dependent upon complicated apparatus as is often supposed . Raw coffee , when kept dry , improves with age . The best Java is said to be some seven or eight years old . To prepare the kernel for use , it must first be properly roasted by a quick heat , like that used for popping corn . The kernels should swell and pop in much the same way , though not to the same extent . When the flavor has thus been developed , and the berry // made brittle , it is to be ground in a mill or pounded in a mortar as fine as may be , and then , to obtain the full strength , placed in an earthenware vessel , covered with cold water , allowed to stand for some hours , and brought to the boiling heat just before use . While this is the most economical treatment , most people prepare an infusion made by pouring boiling water upon the fine coffee . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boiling heat for five to ten minutes ; it should never boil violently , as the delicate aroma of the coffee is then lost . According to one authority : " Coffee , to be good , must be made strong . From one to two ounces to a pint of water is recommended ; three times the volume of milk may then be added . This is better than to add water . In countries where the best coffee is made , there is a concurrence of opinion that roasted coffee should not come in contact with any metal ; but that it should be powdered in a wooden mortar , kept in glass or porcelain , and infused in porcelain or earthenware jugs , or other closed vessels . " An expensive method of preparation is by the percolation of boiling water through the coffee , drop by drop . The simplest apparatus for this is a flannel bag , which carries the coffee , suspended in the coffee pot . The following directions for making coffee in three different ways are given by the courtesy of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston . DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING COFFEE 1 . Fill the coffee pot with cold water . Take the required amount of coffee and turn it in . Let it float // on the water without stirring . Place on the stove to heat , and remove from stove the moment it begins to boil . Decant slowly and carefully into the coffee pot or urn for the table , without disturbing the grounds which will be settled at the bottom of the pot . 2 . Measure out the required amount of coffee and put into a bowl , and add barely enough boiling water to dampen it . Let it stand seven minutes soaking . Put the soaked coffee in the coffee pot , pour on the needed amount of boiling water , and stand the coffee pot on the stove where it will keep very hot , but not boil , for ten minutes . Pour into the table urn , as in Rule I , and serve . A fine-mesh cheese cloth bag to hang in the pot and hold the coffee insures clear coffee by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting in the bag . 3 . If a French coffee pot or urn with a leacher to strain the coffee through is used , be sure to put the dry coffee needed into a bowl , with barely enough hot water to moisten , and soak seven or more minutes . Then put into the leacher , pour the needed amount of boiling water on it , and let it strain through . COFFEE SUBSTITUTES We find in Farmers ' Bulletin No. 122 , 1900 , that coffee substitutes of domestic manufacture have long been known . An infusion of parched corn , or corn coffee , has met with some favor in the household as a drink for invalids , etc . Parched wheat , peas , beans , bread crusts , and corncobs , as well as sweet potatoes cut into small pieces and dried and parched , have also been used . // The coffee substitutes found on the market today frequently claim a high food value as well as a special hygienic quality . " The food value of any such beverage is evidently due ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other substance ) by the water used , and ( 2 ) to the sugar and milk or cream added to the infusion . " The food value of coffee substitutes has been studied by the Maine Experiment Station . Flour , meal , and other ground grains contain little soluble material , but when roasted a portion of the carbohydrates is caramelized and rendered soluble . The infusions studied were made according to directions , varying from 20 to 18o cups a pound of material . It was found that the average infusion had the following composition : water , 98.2 per cent ; protein , 0.2 ; carbohydrates , 1.4 ; fuel value , 30 calories a pound . Skim milk , which is considered a rather " thin " beverage , contains : protein , 3.5 per cent ; fat , 0.3 ; carbohydrates , 5.15 ; or almost twenty times as much food material as the averages made from cereal coffee . If made according to directions one would have to drink 4.5 gallons of an infusion of one of them which made a special claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much food material as is contained in a quart of skim milk . The infusion of true coffee also contains very little nutritive material . It is not ordinarily consumed on account of its food value , however , but on account of its agreeable flavor and stimulating properties . In Europe hundreds of proprietary articles are sold as coffee substitutes , such as " Datel Kaffee , " wheat , // chicory , figs , and coffee ; " Hygienic Nahrkaffee , " cereals and acorns ; peanuts , lupines , and date stones enter into other brands . In America there are a number of favorite substi-tutes prepared from roasted cereals , ground peas , chicory , and other harmless material . In the decade just passed the mixture of cereal coffee with the genuine coffees has become very gen-eral . A few of the preparations labeled as cereal coffees in reality contain a large percentage of coffee , at least in one case as much as 30 per cent . It has been said that " in coffee substitutes , coffee itself should be considered the adulterant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods , which should be understood by the buyer . A gentleman came to engage the author as expert in a legal case against a firm which sold a coffee war-ranted to contain no Java or Mocha coffee , and to be free from the deleterious effects of these coffees . The attending physician had forbidden coffee to the plaintiff 's wife , and had prescribed this brand . The patient grew steadily worse until it was discovered that the article used was nearly half coffee , not Mocha or Java , but presumably one or more of the dozens of brands now on the market from tropical countries with which trade has been established in recent years . COCOA The cocoa of commerce is chiefly prepared from the seeds of the plant Theobvoma cacao , which grows in // the West Indies , in many South American countries , and in some parts of Asia and Africa.l The earliest references to the chocolate plant are in the accounts of the explorers who followed Columbus . It appears to have been known to the inhabitants of Central America from time immemorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1520 , prob ably before either tea or coffee was generally known . After its introduction it was at first only a luxury , but now it is a necessity . England and the United States each uses annually about three-quarters of a pound a head . The term tlicobroma implies food for the gods , and is the name given to the plant by Linn2eus , who is said to have been very fond of the beverage prepared from cocoa , The Mexicans called it cacaoa quahuitl , and the beverage chocolatl ; and we probably derive from these native names our words cocoa and chocolate . The cocoa bean contains 5o per cent of fat , 13 per cent of nitrogenous substance , half of which is soluble , about 7 per cent of a tannin-like principle , 4 per cent of starch , and about I per cent of theobromine , an alkaloid resembling theine . Thus it combines in a remarkable way the important substances which con stitute a perfect food , and it is not strange that it holds so high a place in popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are selected with great care and then thoroughly cleaned // from all dust and foreign matter . The next step in the process of preparing the chocolate for market is the roasting , and here the utmost caution is used to secure a uniform effect ; for if the seeds are under-roasted the full flavor is not obtained , while in over-roasted seeds the flavor is likely to become bitter . By the roasting , the shells become detachable , and are removed and sold as cocoa shells , while the beans , merely cracked , are sold as cocoa nibs . As some time is required to soften the cracked cocoa , the prepared forms are preferred , with or without fat . For these preparations the beans are ground to an extreme fineness , so as to form a perfectly homogeneous mass . If the chocolate is to be a plain chocolate , it is flavored delicately and poured immediately into molds . If a sweet chocolate is to be made , the ground chocolate is mixed with a definite proportion of perfectly pure , finely pulverized sugar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the chocolate is cooled and formed into cakes , it is wrapped and packed for the market . Many persons find in chocolate too much fat for easy digestion . In certain preparations a definite proportion of the oil is extracted , and we have breakfast cocoa , a valuable food even for delicate stomachs . In inferior ( not necessarily cheaper ) grades of chocolate chemical means are used for its preparation from the seed instead of the natural physical means which preserve all the characteristic virtues . For instance , they may be treated with caustic or carbonated alkalies to increase the solubility of the fat , and deepen the color which gives an impression of greater solubility. // In most cases these chemical additions are found in the ash after wholly burning the preparation . Sometimes an attempt is made to supply the loss of flavor by the use of fragrant gums . Adulterations are frequently found in the sugar which is combined with chocolate , and in the vanilla .

" In preparing chocolate as a beverage for the table a mistake has frequently been made in considering it merely as an adjunct to the rest of the meal , instead of giving it its clue prominence as a real food , contain ing all the necessary nutritive principles . A cup of chocolate made with sugar and milk is in itself a fair breakfast . " " Chocolate or cocoa is not properly cooked by having hot water poured over it . It is true that as the whole powder is in suspension and is swallowed , its food material can be assimilated as it is when the prepared chocolate is eaten raw ; but in order to bring out the full fine flavor and to secure the most complete digestibility , the preparation , whatever it be , should be subjected to the boiling point for a few minutes .

" A similar thick , foamy drink may be made by the addition of one tablespoonful of cornstarch , three tablespoonfuls of sugar , and two ounces of chocolate to a quart of milk . The cornstarch should be mixed with about a gill of cold milk , the chocolate melted with the sugar over hot water , and all added to the remainder of the milk just as it comes to the boiling point .

But if it boils ? and it is an important , curious fact the difference a few degrees of heat will make we have a smooth , oily , nutty beverage , which is most agreeable to drink , and very nutritious also , which the bitter beverage is not . There is the same difference between an infusion and a decoction of coffee , but the bitter of coffee is not so unpleasant nor so marked .

The milk of animals has always been used as human food . In early ages it was the milk of goats , asses , etc. , which was common ; now , however , cow 's milk is used all over the world . The composition of milk ' may be roughly stated as follows : water , 86 per cent ; lactose , or milk sugar , 5.5 per cent ; milk fat , 4 per cent ; casein , or curd , 4 per cent ; saline matter , 0.5 per cent . The fat is held in suspension in the liquid in the form of globules , of which it is estimated that there are about three and a half millions in every cubic millimeter . The variations in the food value of milk are great , so that it is quite probable that one man pays much more than his neighbor for the same amount of nutrients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains all the elements necessary for nutrition , and in the right proportions . One of the greatest advances in modern medicine , as well as in wholesome living , is the recog-nition of milk as an article of diet , especially for invalids , young people , and fever patients . Most persons can 47 // digest it when a little lime water is added , if it does not suit them without it . For infants milk is the important food . Until they are twelve or thirteen months old it should be the only food . It is essential , therefore , that the milk supplied be of good quality , and from healthy , well-fed animals . Unfortunately , however , it is true that the deaths of many children from cholera infantum and kindred diseases are due to injurious milk . According to the secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Health , deaths from diarrhoeal diseases are much more frequent among bottle-fed children than among those fed on the mother 's milk . He estimates that ninety per cent of the deaths among children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made by New York authorities . Since infant mortality is a direct loss to the State , as well as a personal grief , communities are waking up to the necessity for a careful investigation of causes , and for stringent regulations as to the purity of the milk . ' The deterioration in the milk of late years is due largely to the change from the clean , intelligent dairy woman who cared for the milk , to the hired , irresponsible laborer who has no sense of cleanliness . The ordinary cow barn is filled with dust and filth , and in the summer with flies , all contributing possible disease-bearing organisms . Among these are certain bacteria which find an especially congenial home in milk and multiply rapidly , causing the so-called lactic // fermentation ; that is , the milk sugar undergoes decomposition , whereby lactic acid is formed and the milk becomes sour . Inasmuch as it has been proved that milk can act as a carrier of infection , the utmost care should be taken in the dairy to render it impossible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another potent cause of poor milk is the concentration of consumers in the cities , necessitating the transportation of milk from greater distances , so that it is of greater age . Hence has arisen the practice of adding preservatives to offset the lack of cleanliness . But greater danger to health comes from the use of milk produced under improper conditions , and from diseased or wrongly fed cows , than from any substances added to the milk ? unless the water taken from a foul well is used . The most frequent method of adulteration is by the addition of water , which reduces the nutritive value for the same volume of milk . Other adulterants are coloring matters , added to give the requisite yellowness , and various chemical preservatives to prevent souring . The common belief that much of the milk sold is mixture of chalk and water is quite unfounded . It is a wrong to sell watered milk , but it is a greater wrong to use foul water to dilute the milk . The pollution of the milk by means of the swill-fed cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much closer watch is kept by the inspector . Since cream , which brings a higher price than milk , // has come into general use , " topped " milk is not un common . Thus , by loss of the fat , the nutritive value is again reduced , and inanition of the child is the result . While skim milk , if sold as whole milk , must be considered an adulterant , it has in itself a definite food value . Whole milk and skim milk contain practically the same amount of protein , but the former costs at least twice as much . " As a source of protein , there-fore , the skim milk is twice as economical as whole milk . On the other hand , the fuel value of skim milk is practically but one-half that of whole milk , so that a given amount of energy is given for the same price , either in whole milk or skim milk . " 1 Of practically the same composition as skim milk is buttermilk , which is the liquid left after separating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per-sons this is a more agreeable beverage than either whole milk or skim milk . The housewife should note certain evidences of good and bad milk : ( I ) There should be no sediment of dirt on standing . ( 2 ) There should be about one-sixth the total depth of cream the narrowing neck of a bottle may make it seem even more . The milk should keep sweet twenty-four hours , and when it tastes sour it should separate into curds and whey , not be simply a uniform white mass , as is likely to happen when soda is used to keep it . The Quarterly Bulletin of the Dairy and Food Com mission of the State of Wisconsin gives the following test as " a practical means of tracing the source of // tainted conditions in milk . The test is made by adding rennet to milk ; after curdling , the curd is cut into small pieces , thus allowing the whey to separate as in cheese making . The drained curd is then incubated at about blood heat to facilitate the rapid growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thus able to overcome the lactic bacteria , so that within six or eight hours the presence of possible taints may be demonstrated . Taints caused by other than gas-forming organisms may also be detected by this forced development . Curds made from good milk occasionally show large , irregular , so-called mechanical holes , due to the lack of pressure on the curd particles , while poor milks contain innumerable small pin holes and possess a decidedly bad odor . " Many States have commissions to investigate the conditions of dairies and creameries and to publish an analysis of the results . The following from a report of the Wisconsin State Commission shows the care with which such investigations are pursued : " Date , ; name of creamery , ; proprietary or cooperative , ; location , ; owner or manager , ; post-office address , ; name of operator , ; he has not attended dairy school at ; number of patrons , ; number of pounds of milk daily , ; number of pounds of butter daily , ; loss of fat in skim milk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigher ; there were no screen doors or windows ; cream hauled to daily ; drainage underground a distance , then to open ditch along the road ; some bad odor in creamery ; location and condition of // skim milk tank upstairs , not clean ; condition of building , fair ; the building is painted outside ; condition of apparatus , poor ; condition of surroundings , fair ; condition of patrons ' milk cans , fair ; condition of milk in cans , good . Remarks : A general lack of cleanliness in this place . " An example of bad conditions may be taken from a town in Massachusetts whose milk supply is said to increase fifty per cent in summer , owing to the influx of summer visitors . Of 16o dairies examined , twothirds were found with conditions to which it was necessary to call the attention , not only of the owners , but also of the Board of Health . There were ioo cow barns needing a general cleaning and whitewashing . In seventy-seven cases the cows were in such dirty condition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detachable filth . In forty-four barns there was an accumulation of manure which required removal , and forty-five cow-yards contained large pools of liquid manure . In one case the owner bedded his cows in horse manure . In four barns the privy was situated directly behind the cows , and in one the floor was made to serve as a privy . The Illinois Experiment Station has issued an excellent bulletin ( No. 91 , December , 1903 ) on preventing the contamination of milk . The Storrs Experiment Station of Connecticut in June , 1906 , issued Bulletin No. 42 , considering the quality of milk as affected by common dairy practices . Encouragement to produce good milk is needed instead of a cry against bad milk . // It always costs to be clean , and clean milk costs more to produce and deliver . Several right-minded persons have tested the public 's willingness and have found it wanting . This must be remedied . If housewives would unite in demanding certified milk , and be willing to pay for it , the quality would rapidly improve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price which means health and even life , instead of illness and death , to thousands of children . Too loud a note can not be sounded in warning , but it must be based on truth , not on exaggeration . The twentieth century woman should not allow herself to be imposed upon by sensational literature , but should inform herself of local conditions . Cooperation is here a necessity , and should be supported as a business venture . CONDENSED MILK The extremely unstable character of milk , and the consequent difficulty of transportation and preservation for any length of time , have led to the adoption of various processes for concentrating the valuable constituents , which are only about 14 per cent of the weight , into a smaller bulk and more stable condition . The usual process consists in simple concentration . The milk is evaporated in vacuum pans , and toward the end heated to 212 ? F. , in order to destroy any germs of mold . It is put up in tin cans , sealed hermetically , and may then be kept any length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In either case , the product is sold as condensed milk , which often contains about one-third as much water as the original liquid . // Evaporated milk is offered as a solution of the problem of supplying a safe milk for children and invalids during the summer months . It is pure milk evaporated , without the addition of sugar , in a vacuum pan at a temperature of about ' 130 ? F. , or below 15o ? F. , which is much lower than that at which con-densed milk is usually prepared . At this low tem-perature the milk is far less changed from its normal condition , and is more digestible than is the case when it is heated to boiling . CREAM When milk is allowed to stand at rest for some hours , the fat globules rise to the top , forming a layer from one-tenth to one-fifth of the total thickness . This layer , rich in fat , is called cream , and contains from 20 to 40 per cent of fat . A sign of increasing prosperity and of more luxu-rious living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apartment dwellers have no facilities for " set-ting " the several quarts of milk needed to supply the breakfast table with this esteemed adjunct to the coffee , fruit , and cereal , even if the milk could be delivered to them in a sweet condition . The separator at the dairy , a truly modern machine , does in a few minutes the work of hours in dividing most of the fat from the fluid emulsion without churn-ing it to butter . Reduced to one-fifth the bulk , it is much more easily transported and delivered to cus-tomers . It is sold as heavy or thin cream . . Probably this use of cream has been the means of // abolishing the now berated American breakfast of steak or eggs and bacon with hot breads . The good prices obtained for cream have doubtless led to some abuses , such as the addition of thickening substances and preservatives . Sucrate of lime , or viscogen , is not in itself harmful , nor does it injure the cream . If , however , a person is avoiding the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of the forbidden substance may prove hurtful . Gelatin is not an objectionable article of diet when properly prepared , but as a thickener of cream it is out of place . Cream naturally thickens on standing , owing to the chemical changes in even clean cream . Sterilized cream has not quite the flavor of fresh cream , but it is safer than dirty cream unsterilized . Fortunately , cream is very easily changed in taste and odor by foreign substances , and therefore is not so deceptive as other adulterated products . The use of cream instead of milk for infants renders it imperative that the public generally should be awake to the conditions of the cream market and should sustain the city and state authorities in their endeavors to protect the helpless children . The matter is in the hands of the buyer . If he will use only certified milk and cream , then the laws can be enforced . BUTTER Butter is a very important article of diet , especially in English-speaking countries . It is of all animal fats the favorite , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the most easily digested . Butter with bread forms an almost perfect food . Herodotus , in his account of the Scythians , makes an obscure mention of butter , and this is the earliest reference known . Dioscorides is the first to observe that when melted and poured over vegetables it serves the same purpose as oil , and that it can be used in pastry . It is not mentioned by Galen , or other writers of his time , as food , and indeed to this clay it is little used in southern countries , so that it might almost be said to be a product of northern civilization in its present uses . There is undoubted evidence that butter was well known to the Anglo-Saxons and used for salves and medicines . Butter is prepared by separating the fats from the water and curd of milk by agitation , which causes the lighter particles of fat to rise . These then are collected and worked into a homogeneous mass . This process seems to be very successfully accomplished at present by the centrifugal machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The water varies from 8 to 16 per cent . Over 16 per cent is injurious to the keeping of butter . There should not be over i per cent of curd left , because it tends to grow rancid and mold , thus tainting the butter . The manufacture of butter has passed from the care of the farmer 's wife to that of the company employee ? to its advantage in some respects , but with certain deteriorations . The skilled dairy woman , with a pride in the flavor and keeping qualities of her product , furnished an artiAND // cle rarely found today , in spite of the artificial ripening of the cream by 1341 , or whatever bacterium is the favorite , On the other hand , creamery butter is of a more uniform quality and better flavor than the butter of ignorant and careless butter makers . There is a great temptation to cheat the pigs to increase the yield of the valuable product , butter , by stuffing with the curd . The old-fashioned country butter , packed in tubs to keep eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curd . The creamery butter of today , especially the light-colored , unsalted variety , frequently contains 20 per cent water and 5 to lo per cent curd , lessening its fuel value , although increasing its nitrogenous value , which is not what we expect to pay for in butter . The author has found as high as 33 per cent of curd . This excess of curd does not injure the flavor , but rather adds to it when fresh . Since , however , it is more readily attacked by decomposing organisms which give very disagreeable tastes and odors , such butter soon spoils and may become dangerous . It should therefore be eaten while fresh . The United States standard for fat is not less than 82.5 per cent . Butter is very sensitive to unpleasant odors , and must be kept with great care , in closed vessels , since even a few hours ' exposure to ordinary air injures the delicate flavor . It would be well if all girls could serve an apprenticeship in a good dairy for a few weeks , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of butter fats are for the // most part identical with those in olive and palm oils , and in other animal fats ; but the peculiar flavor of butter is due to the presence of 5 to 8 per cent of butyric , capric , caprylic , and caproic acids . These fatty acids are much less stable than oleic , palmitic , and stearic acids , which are often called the fixed fatty acids . In butter , human fat , and goose fat , palmitic acid is the most abundant . It is so named from its occurrence in palm oil . Oleic acid is common to these fats , and to beef , mutton , and hog fats . Stearic acid is found in small quantities in butter , while it is a chief and constant constituent of beef tallow . During the Franco-German War , in 1870-71 , a French chemist , Mege-Mouries , invented a process for obtaining from other animal fats the fatty acids common to them and to butter , and making from them a very fair artificial butter , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from the fatty acids present oleic and margaric , as the mixture of stearic and palmitic acids was formerly called . Oleomargarine and butterine are prepared in a similar manner from oleo oil ( beef fat ) or neutral lard and milk by churning and salting and coloring to imitate butter . These are wholesome food products , and their use furnishes a much needed fat to an economical diet . As a rule oleo keeps better than creamery butter , and if the latter is loaded with curd the oleo has a higher food value . But they should be sold under their own names ? Rarely has there been a fraud so difficult to detect , since not only the apparent but the real // differences between genuine and artificial butter are but slight . Yet careful chemical analysis will show about 87 per cent of fixed fatty acids in butter , and about 95 per cent in the fats used in making artificial butter . Reichert 's process of determining the volatile acids peculiar to butter answers well in skilled hands . An analytical chemist has little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The expense attending such an examination , however , prevents its application as often as is desirable . The detection of the crystals of the different fats , as proposed by Taylor , may be an important aid . Some simple and easily applied test is much to be desired , but the public yet awaits its discovery . /Butter which has become rancid may be sweetened or " renovated " on a large scale by a process long used by the housewife in essential . It is melted , the curd and brine allowed to settle , and the scum removed ; the butter fat is then aerated by a current of air blown through it in some cases to take out disagreeable odors , and then churned with milk , whole or skimmed , cooled , and packed . This butter will not keep as long as fresh , well-worked butter , and if sold without a correct label is a fraud . The carrot and certain weeds served the farmer for his butter color . The dairies used annato , but the creameries find the coal tar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silk or wool in an alcoholic solution of the butter fat with the addition of water and cream of tartar . 6o FOOD MATERIALS One of the State chemists says , " The practice of coloring butter is now so firmly fixed , and the taste of consumers so bent to the false standard , that it is not probable that it will ever be abandoned . " CHEESE Good cheese is composed of the total solids of milk curdled by rennet before the milk sours . Poor cheese is made from skimmed milk , and hence has less fat . Cheese is really a condensed milk , less the sugar and part of the mineral salts , and is a valuable article of diet , replacing meat , to a great extent , with those whose stomachs it suits ; but on account of unjustifiable prejudice it is much neglected . One pound of dry cheese is estimated to contain as much nitrogenous substance as a pound or a pound and a half of beef as purchased . The rind of the cheese may have been brushed over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fungi , etc , so that it is well to pare it off before eating . The ripening of cheese has been the subject of much study . The dairy schools give close attention to the production of all varieties , and very soon American cheese may be had of any desired quality , instead of the former crude , tough substance that is digested only with difficulty . The great advantage of cheese is that it may be put up on the dairy farm under cleanly conditions and then transported and kept without change , being too concentrated for ready decomposition . Dangerous preservatives rarely find their way into // cheeses . " Filled " cheese has the butter fat replaced by foreign fats , such as lard and cotton seed oil . Eggs contain all the necessary constituents of food in the most concentrated form ? so concentrated as to be unsuited for the whole of the daily ration . For convalescents they are invaluable when they can be obtained fresh . Eggs as bought consist of about 11 per cent shell , 32 per cent yolk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest food value because it contains less water and more fat . Egg-white contains 86.2 per cent water , 12.3 per cent proteid , 0.2 per cent fat . Egg-yolk contains 49.5 per cent water , 15.7 per cent proteid , 33.3 per cent fat . The yolk contains more mineral matter and is an especially valuable food in anxmic and nervous conditions . The egg production of the United States is one of // the most important and valuable . It is estimated at not less than a billion dozens . Dietary studies have shown that eggs constitute three per cent of the total food . The normal eggshell has a natural coating of mucilaginous matter which prevents the various microorganisms from passing through , at least for a time ; but if this is washed or rubbed off putrefaction sets in and proceeds with rapidity because of the rich food material . Water evaporates through the pores of the shell , so that old , unvarnished eggs are of greater specific gravity than new-laid . Cold storage in a fairly moist atmosphere is the usual method of keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they absorb odors very readily . Various methods of preserving ? packing in oatmeal or bran , covering with brine or lime water , treating with salicylic acid , varnishing with collodion or shellac ? have been tried , with a usual loss of half the pack . At the North Dakota Experiment Station marked success has been obtained by coating the fresh , unwashed eggs with a dilute solution of water glass ( one part of the thick , not too alkaline syrup as purchased to ten parts of water ) . These eggs are said to keep all their qualities , even that of beating up well for frosting . Desiccated eggs have been successfully prepared for provisioning camps and expeditions . The water being removed enables four times the food value to be carried in the same weight . // Several egg substitutes have appeared on the market . One of considerable food value is said to be made from skim milk and flour , probably slightly colored . Others seem to be chiefly starch highly colored . These can not replace eggs in the diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One " remarkable substitute for fresh eggs " has recently been put upon the market with the claim that " the contents of this can is equal to and will do the work of thirty-six fresh eggs . " Examination shows it to consist almost wholly of artificially colored corn meal . The most astonishing thing about such frauds is that intelligent women can be found to buy them . The German immigrant woman would know better . CHAPTER V CEREAL FOODS-BARLEY , RICE , OATS , MAIZE , RYE , AND WHEAT THE term cereals has come to have a limited significance since the universal introduction of breakfast foods . The public needs to be reminded that there are only six or seven grains in common use and that the 365 brands of cereals must be made from these , and therefore that the same thing must be sold under many names . Cereals all belong to the family of grasses , and some member of the group flourishes in every latitude . Bar-ley grows even within the arctic circle , and thence southward are found , in the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while within the tropics rice is found . The seeds of these plants have been used for the food of man from time immemorial . They are . ' the most abundant of all food substances . The Egyptians have a tradition that barley was the first to be so used . A general description will serve for all the seeds or kernels . The shape is from round to oval or oblong , with a groove on one side running the length of the kernel . This indentation serves to protect the germ which it incloses . Outside the germ are usually rec ognized three layers . The outer layer , which serves to hold the inner ones compactly together and to keep 6q // them dry , is made up chiefly of woody fiber , or cellulose , and is comparatively worthless for the purpose of nutrition . Next there are in most grains one or more layers of cells which contain nitrogenous and phosphatic compounds ; while within , forming the body of the seed , is found the mass of starch granules , larger and smaller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All these are supported in a loose framework of cellular tissue . The proportion of these constituents varies greatly in the different grains and in varieties of the same grain . Rice has the largest proportion of starch , and oats contain the most oily and phosphatic material . The term flour is often used to designate the meal or powder obtained by the grinding of any species of grain or seed . But the use of the word in the United States is for the most part limited to the finely ground portion , the more starchy portion ; while by the term meal  --  a Saxon word meaning finely ground , soft to the touch ? is understood the product of the grinding of the whole grain . Both terms are generic , and are qualified by a descriptive adjective , as wheat flour , corn meal , etc . Barley and rice are for the most part cooked whole ; oats and maize are coarsely crushed ; while wheat and rye are finely ground and separated into the flour , or white sifted starch and gluten , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the sifting is technically called . The greatest change in the habits of food consumption which the last twenty years has developed is in // the greatly increased use of prepared cereals ? both cereals which may be cooked quickly and those which may be eaten uncooked . There are several causes contributing to this resultChief of these is the money to be made by the quick marketing of a popular food . When a particular name begins to pall , the same material , or that combination with a slight variation in appearance , is put on the market under a new name . Prizes are offered for a name which will sell the packages most quickly . Much ingenuity has been spent on this manufacture of cereals into new shapes , and more on the advertising description of them . The constant demand for something new , as if Burbank could indeed use the wizard 's wand on the grain fields , has flooded the market with prepared foodsa brand for every day in the year made from the varieties of grains known for thousands of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continental or meatless breakfast , often eaten - in the living room , have created a demand for a tasty cereal to be served without the trouble of cooking . A morbid craving for variety and the too often poor quality of the cooked cereal served in boarding houses and hotels has also favored the use of the various " flakes , " which make such admirable conveyors of cream and which crackle so delightfully . There is little cause for alarm as to the introduction of poisonous substances into these products . It may be possible that in some cases impure chemicals have been used , but it is very doubtful if direct addition of // poison has occurred . The chief danger is to be found in the ignorance of the public as to food values and the needs of the body . In order to furnish the heat and energy for a day 's work or pleasure at least eight or ten ounces of carbohydrates and three ounces of fats are needed . These fluffy , flaky materials occupy space , but have little weight compared with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived as to the quantity . Again , these foods are partly transformed or predigested , so that they pass quickly into circulation , giving a satisfied feeling , which soon passes , leaving a hunger liable to be quieted by nibbling at candy , chocolate , or crackers between meals . If deluged with rich cream and sugar the food value of the dish is greatly enhanced . The addition of the sugar , however , for a breakfast dish is not to be recommended . Fermentations inimical to the best assimilation of food are likely to arise . It is interesting to note that in the recent discussion of pure food legislation the clause requiring the weight to be put on the package failed of enactment . That would have affected the cereal foods , for when many housewives realize that they pay twenty-five cents a pound for some fancy name , but for no more food value than they can obtain for two and a half or three cents , then they will count the cost of gas and time to see if they can afford the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made by the states of Wyoming , Maine , and Connecticut , for instance . From the published facts the following comparison is compiled : // For ten cents one buys of the last named 677 heat units of food value , and of the first 8,200 heat units ? enough for nearly three days ' ration . The cost of gas for cooking is , however , to be taken into account . The truth about breakfast foods is that the housewife saves time and trouble at considerable cost to her pocket . The Bulletin says : " Of the fifty brands recently collected only twenty-one are found in the list of three years ago . There seems to be a tendency on the part of manufacturers to substitute new and attractive names for a product that has been before the public for some time . " This is caused in part by the deterioration which // the manufacturers permit , either by the packages becoming stale and even wormy or by less care in production . During the time of introduction the new name means fresh material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by steaming raw , crushed by rolls , and then dried so as to keep . The starch is then more soluble . Sometimes the heat is dry heat , either at first or after steaming , and then there is a dextrinizing and browning , like the crust of bread . The malted foods are mixed with barley and partly predigested . These prepared cereals have their place , but the family provider , not the manufacturer , should decide what that place shall be in each case . The lazy habit of obtaining information ( ? ) from the label , instead of developing common sense and real knowledge , is responsible for most of these drains on the pocket . As stated before , it is within the power of every housewife to know , and the bureau of information should find a place in every club . As to the loss in food value by this predigestion of the prepared foods the last word has not been said . Cooking doubtless changes the relations of the various ingredients , but the waste within the body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of others . The steam cooking either does not develop or dissipates the flavor , so that one tires of the mush or adds sugar ? a dietetic sin ? and cream and fruits . In this // respect the flaked and toasted varieties are more " tasty , " if not more digestible , as they may well prove , however , if thoroughly masticated . BARLEY Barley belongs to the genus Hordeum . It is prob-ably a native of Northern or Central Asia , but it has a remarkable power of adapting itself to a great range of temperature , and has a wider distribution than wheat or oats . On the eastern continent its culture extends from 70 ? north latitude to 42 ? south , and in Amer-ica from 62 ? north to 20 ? south . Its use as an article of food is coeval with the history of man . It yields a greater produce per acre than any other grain except rice . It was largely cultivated by the Romans , and used chiefly as food for horses . In England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly used as the food of the people because it grew readily in any part of the kingdom . Since improved means of transportation have brought all countries within a few days of each other , wheat is carried to lands in which it will not thrive , and people no longer need to live on the produce of their own soil . Barley has less starch and more cellulose , mineral matter , and fat than rice . It is largely used for the manufacture of beer , being better suited for it than the other grains . Its flavor should commend it to the intelligent consumer for more varied use . RICE Perhaps no other food stuff has been so misrepre-sented as rice . On the one hand , it is often stated in // print and in conversation that rice is " only starch and has no nutritive value . " On the other hand , the Chinese and Japanese and other East Indian people are said to " live on rice . " It has been represented , in the case of the recent war , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This only illustrates the need of universal education in the matter of food values . Under the direction of Prof. W. O. Atwater this subject was thoroughly investigated by the United States government at the time of the Chicago Exposition with reference to several groups quartered in the Midway , especially in the case of the Java village . Other studies of the dietary habits of so-called rice-eating people have been made on the spot with the same general result , namely , that rice is found to take the place of bread , potatoes , and vegetables ? in a word , furnishes the pound of starch a day which other nations take in a variety of forms . Since rice contains only a small proportion of either fat or nitrogenous compounds , it can not form the sole food of human beings for any length of time , but the great bulk of cooked rice has misled many observers , and caused them to overlook the concentrated nitrogenous food which always accompanies it . For instance , the Java village people brought with them potted fish roe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco import from China dried ducks ' livers and hard-boiled clucks ' eggs . All the peoples who have been investigated use meats , chicken , ducks , fish , or some other form of proteid supply . They do not use this in the wasteful excess in which // American communities usually revel , but in a sufficient quantity , as a rule . It is the fat which is more pften lacking in their diet . Rice is admirably adapted to serve as a conveyor of fat and proteid , in the form of cheese , for instance . Different varieties show differing food values . The Japanese variety is richer in nitrogen substances . The rice of commerce is the product of the grass OYyza saliva , probably a native of the East Indies , but cultivated in all portions of tropical and subtropical regions . It forms the principal food of nearly onethird of the human race , and enters largely into the diet of all civilized nations . It has been known in China for 5,000 years . The outer coat of woody fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as sent to market , the shelled grain is It grows in the north temperate regions , and deserves more notice than it has hitherto received . Rice flour is now largely used in the adulteration of many finely ground foods and of condiments . ( ( ( ( History tells us that the first rice grown in this country was introduced in 1695 by the captain of a brig from Madagascar , who gave some seed to Governor Smith and his friends to experiment with , and the result has been an important industry . The rices which chance introduction had brought in were looked upon . as the finest in quality in the world and were exported to Europe ; but with the call for a whiter and more polished product than the hand-threshed rice of planAND // tation days came machine-polished rice , and the center of the rice industry was transferred to Louisiana and Texas by the discovery of artesian wells in those states . " The machine-polished rice that we buy in this country today is , as every one knows , a truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paste that a paper hanger brushes on his rolls of wall paper . The loather rollers of the machine not only rub off all the fine outer layer of nutritious matter , and with it the part that gives flavor to the kernels , but they often break the long , slender grains that characterize the famous Carolina golden rice . This breakage is so great that the Louisiana growers begged for assistance , and the new Office of Plant Introduction sent Dr. S. A. Knapp to Japan in search of a short-kerneled variety that would not break in the milling process . Today Dr. Knapp declares that one-half of all the rice grown in Louisiana and Texas is the Kiushu rice that had its origin in the introduction made in 1899 . " This new rice has reduced the breakage from forty to ten per cent , and has at the same time brought into culture a more productive rice . It has not done away with the pernicious practice of polishing , but an interest in the unpolished rice has lately been aroused that , it is hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robs the buyer of nearly all of the flavoring matter of the rice and leaves only the starchy portion . It is a disgrace that the most intelligent nation in the world should be so ignorant of the food value of the crop on which more people live than on any other , that they should insist on having their rice // made as shiny as polished glass beads , although in so doing they are throwing away the best part of it . No rice-eating people treat their rice as we do , and it is to be hoped that the small markets that have been started for the unpolished rice will lead to a general propaganda in its favor . " 1 OATS Oatmeal is prepared from two species , Avena saliva and Avena orientalis , which belong to the same natural order as wheat . This grain grows best in a cool , moist climate . Its native country is not known with cer tainty . There is evidence that the plant was known in Britain in 1296 , and mention is made of the use of oat-meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1698 the consumption of oatmeal was second only to barley , but wheat has gradually taken its place in Southern England . By kiln-drying and removing the husk , groats or grits are obtained , which , when ground , yield oatmeal . The husk is not as completely removed as in the case of rice , and the meal is not as white as wheat meal . Although it contains a large proportion of nitrog enous matter , it is not in the form of the tenacious gluten of wheat ; hence it will not make light or porous bread . Oatmeal is not as easily digested as wheat flour , and as a staple article of diet it is best suited to persons who are much in the open air ; but a portion of the morning meal may advantageously be of this very nutritious grain . Blyth says that in England it is sometimes adulterated with barley meal . // MAIZE Maize ( Zea mays ) is remarkable in the order of grasses for the large size of its grains , and for the heads into which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico and in tropical America , and has now been introduced into every quarter of the globe , though it can not be relied upon as a field crop in Great Britain . It has been said that what wheat is in Europe and rice in Asia , maize is in America . Maize , or Indian corn , as it is called in the United States , was not much consumed in England until the year of the potato famine , in 1846 , when hominy was imported . Now millions of pounds are annually imported , chiefly from the Black and Mediterranean Sea borders . It is the leading cereal crop in the United States , four times as much as wheat being grown . It is an excellent food , easily digested and very nutritious . It is much used for the preparation of starch and for " infants ' foods . " The starch is separated , and used in place of the more costly arrowroot . It is used in the manufacture of glucose , whisky , etc , and is fed to animals . RYE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more careful cultivation and a wider use . It is less irritating to the digestive tract than wheat , and its flavor in combination with other grains would give a greater variety of breads . Rye ( Secale cerale ) is nearly allied to wheat . The grains are smaller , and the flour not so white . It is // very rich in nitrogenous substances . It grows a little farther north than wheat flourishes , and it thrives on a sandy soil too poor for any other grain . The bread made from rye flour is not so white and light as that made from wheat flour , but it is extensively used in Europe . The chief objection to its use is , that it is liable to be injured by a fungus , which produces an appearance like a spur , and which is called ergot . If these swelled grains are ground with the others , the flour is rendered unwholesome and even dangerous . WHEAT Wheat flour is prepared from the seeds of Triticum sativum . The cultivation of wheat has superseded that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the temperate zone as far as 6o ? north ) , but in the Middle Ages it was food for the wealthy classes only . Its use has been constantly on the increase , until it is now food for all classes . The reason seems to be , that bread made from it has no unpleasant or pronounced taste , so that the most fastidious palate does not become weary of it , and has a light , spongy , or porous character , quite peculiar to the wheat loaf . This adapts it for ready digestion , and is due to the peculiar nature of gluten , which in good flour is very elastic , and when the moistened dough is compressed causes it to spring back again to its place . The quality of the prepared flour is dependent upon the variety of wheat , the curing of the ripened grain , and the process of grinding . There are two kinds of wheat , the hard and the soft , which are referred to in the description of the grinding . // The curing of wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is allowed to become damp and moldy a disagreeable flavor will be communicated to the flour . Among other quick methods of producing effects formerly gained only by time is that of aging flour by electricity . This bleaches the flours , and may permit of the admixture of a less white or lower grade flour . According to an advertisement in a recent issue of the Modern Miller , two-thirds of the flour manufactured in the United States is so aged . Such flour appears to give a test for nitrites by the method used for water . For grinding two processes are used , which are known as high and low milling . In early times the kernels were brayed in a mortar , and later they were ground between stones . Low milling is a grinding between two large , round stones , one or both revolving at so small a distance from each other as to crush the kernels , which are caught , as it were , by radial grooves in the stones . The wheat is often moistened in grinding , as it is thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable , so that the temperature of the flour as it comes from the stones is about 1200 F. The heating , and the grinding of a portion of the husk so fine that it sifts with the body of the grain , are the chief objections to this method . It is thought that the heat may change somewhat the character of the gluten , rendering it less tenacious , and so the flour less fit for the making of light bread . The action is purely a single crushing , and was used for the softer kinds of wheat . High milling , which is a succession of // crackings , or of slight and partial crushings , alternating with sifting and sorting , is better adapted to hard wheat . There is also a mixture of the two processes called half high milling . In general , the modern commercial process may be described as follows : The wheat is first cleaned , then passes to a series of cylindrical rolls arranged at distances so graded that when the wheat kernel passes between the first set it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set and are again cracked , and so on , each set pulverizing a little fine : - than the preceding one . In this way the husk is not bruised , only flattened out and loosened so that the dry starch granules drop out . The flour is not heated , since it is not subjected to friction , and since it falls through the cool air between each set of rolls . At each grinding the fine flour is removed by bolting , and finally all the different streams are blended to form different grades of flour . It is thought that the separation of the non-nutritious portion is also more complete , and hence that the flour is richer in the phosphates and nitrogenous substances which are found in the layer of cells next the husk . Since there are no particles of bran in the high-milled flour it is whiter , and since it has been ground dry it has less moisture and will keep longer . Low milling yields about 8o per cent of flours of various grades , differing comparatively little from each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 72 per cent being straight grade or ordinary white flour . // Flour for household use will perhaps average 7o per cent of starch and dextrin , about 7 per cent each of sugar , mineral matter , and cellulose , 1 per cent of fat , and about 15 per cent of albuminous or nitrogenous substances . These constituents are so proportioned as to render wheat flour a highly nutritious food , capable by itself of sustaining life and health . " The durum wheat , from which the bread of the common people is made in Southern Europe and Russia , was almost an unknown thing on our grain markets until 1900 ; but today it is a living question in the milling centers of the Northwest . It is a wheat for the dry lands , where the ordinary kinds grow poorly or not at all , and it yields so much more per acre and is so much surer a crop that , even if it should not bring the highest prices , it will pay better than the less drouth resistant species which Western farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dakotas and Nebraska . " Custom still fights the innovation of a new flour , and there are people who think our bread is in danger of being deteriorated by the new introduction ; but they are not the well-informed who have tasted the full-flavored wheat breads of Spain or Italy , or who realize the great and growing future of macaroni as a food in this country . American-made macaroni , prepared with the best of the old American wheats , can not be compared with the delicate products of a Gragnano factory . But with the culture of this durum wheat in America a change is coming , and the time may come when we shall ship macaroni to Italy instead 8o FOOD MATERIALS of importing it at the rate of nearly $2,000,000 a year . This innovation in the great wheat industry has been the result of the efforts of Mr. M. A. Carleton , who was sent to Russia as an agricultural explorer of the Office of Plant Introduction in 1898 and in 1900 . The office has distributed thousands of bushels of the durum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Russian countries where it is grown . " 1 The ' importance of good flour can hardly be over-estimated , since upon good bread depends the health of the greater part of the human race in all temperate climates . This is not the place to discuss physiological ques tions , or to take part in the war of words over graham , whole wheat , and fine flour . A discussion of the chem ical side of the question will be found in the Thesis of Miss Charlotte A. Bragg , Technology Quarterly , vol . III , No. 3 , 1890 , from which the following extract is made : " The following tables give in a condensed form the results of the analyses of the two samples of wheat , and the products derived from them . A balance sheet was deduced therefrom . // " The balance sheet defines the position of fine white flour very clearly . It shows that hard spring wheat gives a flour rich in nitrogen , 69.5 per cent of the total being saved in the three grades of flour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is there more bran , but it is richer in nitrogen . Nev ertheless , 62.2 per cent of the total nitrogen is saved . There is , therefore , no need to eat whole wheat bread in order to obtain a food rich in nitrogen . " Quite another story is told by a study of the proportion of phosphorus . The two varieties of wheat more nearly approach each other , but the spring wheat loses 79.6 per cent and the winter wheat 77.8 per cent of its total phosphorus . Here , then , is the bone of contention . The fine white flour is sadly deficient in phosphorus , but is the phosphorus which is contained // in the bran available for human food ? According to the latest experiments of Professors Voit and Riibner in Munich , it would seem that not only is the bran quite indigestible , but that by its irritating action it causes a loss of both nitrogen and carbohydrates , which would be available in its absence . ? It would seem , therefore , fair to conclude that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eyes and palate , may , after all , be the one best adapted to the needs and conditions of the human system . " Since the amount of gluten in a flour often has an interest for the housewife beyond that of nutritive value , a means of estimating it is often called for . Wiley ( Agricultural Analysis , vol . III , p. 435 ) gives the following as a method for separating crude gluten from flour : Ten grams of flour ( or one-half an ounce may be taken ) are well moistened with a nearly equal weight of cool water ( not over 6o ? F. ) , worked into a ball , and allowed to stand an hour . It is then kneaded in a stream of cold water until the starch and soluble matter is removed . It may be weighed moist as a rough comparison with other flours . BUCKWHEAT Buckwheat ( Fagopyrum esculcntum ) a native of Central Asia , does not belong to the grasses or cereals , but to the family Polygonacece , which includes rhubarb and dock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands next to barley . It matures very quickly ? in one hundred clays ? and thrives on sandy soil . It is probably a native of Asia , and is largely grown in temperate // countries . The seed , when stripped of its indigestible husk , which composes about 20 per cent of it , is rich in food material . It is often adulterated with cheaper flour . Of 107 samples examined by Winton in 1900 , twenty-six contained wheat flour or middlings , nine maize flour , and nine contained them both . The prepared or self-raising buckwheats are usually mixtures of flours with baking powder . STARCHES , ETC . The prepared starches are purified , so that they contain little else than pure starch , and thus are not capable of sustaining life by themselves . Starch may be derived from the cereal grains mentioned before , or from tubers or roots , as the potato , arrowroot , and manihot or yucca , which yields farina and tapioca , and from the sterns of plants , as the sago palm . Cornstarch is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Farina is another name for a preparation from the starch of maize or wheat , which now takes the place of the farina of manihot . Genuine macaroni , spaghetti , and vermicelli are made from wheat rich in gluten , and hence are nutritious , but not more rich than some other wheat preparations . Imitations are made from a less rich flour colored with saffron or other yellow coloring matter . Arrowroot is derived from plants of the genus Iklaranta , of the West India Islands and tropical America , the chief species being AT . arundinacea . The earliest recorded notice of the plant , the knowledge of which was obtained from South American // Indians , refers to the supposed virtue possessed by its roots as an antidote to poisoned arrows ; and it probably derives its name from this . Arrowroot was introduced into England about the beginning of the last century ; but its use has been largely superseded by that of cornstarch . These foods for infants and invalids need attention on account of misrepresentations and the fact that physi-cians ignorantly prescribe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which are far from what they profess to be . Some of them are simply starchy mixtures , more or less cooked , but not converted . The milk foods are dried milk , usually too low in fat , Nestle 's Food being the only exception . Mellin 's Food is the only food which does not con-tain starch , but this is too low in fat and should be given with cream . // Horlick 's Malted Milk , Lactated Food , and Reid and Carnrick 's Baby Food are mixtures of which the first has the least starch . BREAD AND CRACKERS Bread and crackers are so largely purchased that attention should be given to clean manufacture . A poster recently displayed showing a boy and girl hug-ging in their arms several loaves of unwrapped bread , some of which must fall to the ground before many steps , illustrates the careless handling of cooked foods . There is far more clanger to health in this direction than in the possible use of alum or ammonia by a few bakers . The light weight loaf , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the buyer supposes . The cracker manufacturer needs to be watched as to quality of ingredients and care in handling , especially since his products are so largely used by children . CHAPTER VI SUGAR THE word sugar , probably of Sanskrit origin , is now used to designate a class of substances possessing a sweet taste and capable of breaking up into alcohol and carbon dioxide under the influence of ferments , such as yeast . Common sugar is called cane sugar , because it is obtained principally from the sugar cane , a tall grass , Saccharum officinarum , a native of Southern Asia . It is the sweetest of all the sugars , and is technically called sucrose . It has been known from the earliest historic times . Some early writers spoke of it as " honey made from reeds without bees . " According to Albertus Agnensis , as stated by Muspratt , in the time of the Crusades sweet honeyed canes were found in great quantity in the meadows near Tripoli in Syria , which reeds were called zucra . The plant was cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strained juice set by in vessels " till concreted in the form of snow , or white salt ; this , when scraped , they mix with bread , or rub it in water and take it as pottage , and it is to them more wholesome and pleasing than the honey of bees . " The sucrose of commerce is also obtained from the beet , the palm , and the maple tree , and from another grass , Sorghum saccharatum. 87 i // The sugar cane contains about 18 per cent of sugar . The canes are crushed and passed through powerful presses . The juice is boiled in vacuum pans with a little milk of lime , added to neutralize the acids which the juice contains ; this forms a scum , which is taken off . After the boiling has concentrated the juice sufficiently , it is run into a large vessel to crystallize . The mass of crystals formed is drained from the syrup , and is known as raw or muscovado sugar . The non-crystallized portion is known as molasses . This boiling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West India or New Orleans molasses , with which she made such delicious gingerbread , which even " mother " can no longer prepare . The acid molasses produced by the slow evaporation of the sugar cane juice in open pans is to be found only rarely and in small quantity on the market . In 1903 ? 04 only 27,964,292 gallons of molasses were produced in the United States as against 37,000,000 gallons in 1902 ? 03 . The grades of sugar also have changed very much . The dark brown sugars have almost disappeared from the market . This is owing to the improved methods of boiling . The granulated is of the same quality as loaf sugar , only the syrup is stirred while crystallizing , so that the crystals do not cohere . The light brown sugars are the next product , containing some molasses , and therefore they taste sweeter , since the flavor is more pronounced in the colored portion of the juice . If the granulated sugar is not quite freed from the // syrup , it tastes more decidedly sweet than if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more the taste which we are accustomed to associate with sugar . It is often said that powdered sugar must be adul terated , because it does not sweeten as much as loaf sugar ; but such is not the case , and some explanation must be sought . The reason seems to be twofold : first , a spoonful of powdered sugar does not weigh as much as a spoonful of granulated ; second , since sweet ness is a physical property , the finely divided condition of the sugar has something to do with it . The coarser grains seem to excite in the nerves of taste a stronger vibration , so to speak , in dissolving than do the fine particles . To prove this , equal weights of loaf , of gran ulated of different degrees of fineness , of powdered , and of coffee-crushed sugar were dissolved in equal volumes of water and then tested by various persons , the tumblers containing the solutions being numbered , so that the taster was an unbiased judge . Some pure honey was added to the list , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not due to the chemical purity of the substance . In every case the coffee sugar was pronounced the sweetest , and that of the solution of honey the least sweet . As to the solu tions of the other sugars , which were all pure sucrose , judgments varied , showing that the sensation of sweet ness is not owing solely to the presence of a certain amount of sucrose . That beet root contained a sugar identical with that obtained from the sugar cane was first made known by Margraf in 1747 . But the beet was not cultivated // for the purpose to any extent until the middle of the last century . Under the protection of Napoleon I. , the industry gradually gained ground . A prize of a million francs was offered for the successful manufacture of sugar from plants of home growth . As late as 186o the fate of beet sugar was doubtful , since the disagreeable flavor of the molasses still clung to the crystallized sugar . But applied science has overcome all the difficulties . The purest loaf sugar is now made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as much beet sugar as cane sugar . The total amount of beet sugar produced in 1840 was 50,000 long tons . The total amount of cane sugar produced in 1840 was 1,4 oo , 000 long tons . The . otal amount of beet sugar produced in 1905 was 6,990,000 long tons . The total amount of cane sugar produced in 1905 was 4,908,000 long tons . The culture of the beet has spread throughout Germany and Russia . It has been tried in England , Ireland , and the Northern United States , and is proving a source of profit in many latitudes where the sugar cane will not thrive . Beets contain up to I o or 12 per cent of sugar . In Belgium and France they extract about 7 per cent , and in Germany 8 or 9 per cent . The process of manufacture differs little from that of cane sugar . The molasses from beet sugar is mostly sent to the distillery , as it has a very disagreeable taste . In parts of the United States and in Canada sugar is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other allied species . The sugar is cane sugar , or // sucrose , and the accompanying substances in the sap give an agreeable flavor quite peculiar to maple sugar . Several million pounds are annually produced . The cultivation of the Chinese sugar grass , or sugar millet ( Sorghum sacclwratum ) , has been attempted in the United States , with some success . It seems to be suited to a warm temperate zone , and thus is intermediate between the northern maple and beet and the tropical sugar cane . It is used largely for fodder , however . The term sugar , as used today , is a very general one covering a wide range of substances , the number of which is constantly growing by virtue of chemical research . The housewife has to do with two of the great groups : 1 . The monosaccharids ( C6H1 , O6 ) , or glucoses . At least fifteen are named , to which belong grape sugar ( dextrose ) , crystallizable ; fruit sugar ( levulose ) , non-crystallizable ; and invert sugar , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiling with acid ) . 2 . The disaccharids ( C19H22O11 ) , or sucroses . To this class belong cane sugar , or sucrose , beet sugar , maple sugar , malt sugar ( maltose ) , and milk sugar , or lactose . The sugars are often divided into reducing ( those which reduce copper from copper sulphate ) , maltose , lactose , invert sugar , dextrose , levulose ; and nonreduciug , as cane sugar , beet sugar , maple sugar . Starch is a polysaccharid , along with cellulose , dextrin , glycogen , and pectin . It can be considered as // an aggregation of Too groups derived from dextrose , C6HI206 ( IOO C6H1005 ) , by the removal of water from each during plant growth . These water molecules may be replaced and sugar again formed by treating with acid ( artificial or unnatural ) or by the action of an enzyme , as diastase , the natural ferment found in barley in abundance . In the acid hydrolysis the starch breaks up gradually into maltose , a dextrin , and dextrose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule . Much confusion is caused by the loose way in which the term " glucose " is commonly used . Formerly it was the designation of all the manufactured products , whether solid or viscous , but of late the term " starch sugar , " or dextrose , covers the solid sugars and glucose means the syrup form , from the Greek glukus , meaning sweet . While all kinds of starch , and even cellulose , will yield starch sugar when treated ( hydrolyzed ) with acid , corn is the chief source . The grain is soaked in huge vats , holding some 2,500 bushels , in warm water for several days . Sulphur dioxide is added to sterilize and to soften the hulls . The grain is then ground , and the starch is washed through bolting cloth sieves and allowed to settle . If it is desired to save the germ , a first coarse grinding allows it to float away and a second finer grinding sets free the starch grains . The collected starch , mixed with water to a creamy consistency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrochloric acid to each Io , 000 pounds of starch . It is heated under pressure of some thirty // pounds and drawn off , decolorized , and refined in much the same manner as the juice of the sugar cane . The demand for starch sugar for candies and jellies , and of glucose for syrups , has caused an enormous production in this country , irrespective of its use in beers . Confectionery is usually preferred in a soft or amorphous condition ; rock candy or crystallized sugar is rarely called for . It is for this reason that sugar for making candy is inverted , or changed into reducing sugar ( mixture of dextrose , or grape sugar , and levulose or fruit sugar ) , by boiling with some acid , usually cream of tartar or tartaric acid . The " fondant " of chocolate creams and bonbons may be made in this way . Gums and starch pastes , even clay , may be used to dilute the crystals of sugar and keep the mass agreeably soft , but commercial glucose is easier to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in modern candy making . The pastes and cheap gum drops are made of starch , paste , and glucose . Marshmallows have gelatin added . It requires two and one-half times as much glucose as cane sugar to sweeten the same volume of water . This may partly explain the increasing pounds of candy consumed . Grape sugar is present in the sacs of flowers , and is the source of honey . It can be readily obtained from grapes by expressing the juice , and after neutralization of the acids the syrup may be refined and crystallized as in the case of beet sugar , but it crystallizes with difficulty and is apt to take on water and become moist . // It is accompanied by the non-crystallizable sugar , levulose . Grape sugar made from grapes is too costly for ordinary use . In jellies and preserved fruits a large portion of the cane sugar , or sucrose , is changed into glucose during the heating with the acid juice of the fruit . The following table i shows the proportion of sugars and acid in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all woody fiber or cellulose can be acted upon by acids so as to form glucose ; hence any woody substance , as sawdust , cotton , etc , can be converted into glucose ; but this is not done for the purpose of sugar manufacture , since corn meal is much more available . Such waste product may be used for spirits . // Milk sugar , or lactose ( C12H22011 H , , O ) , is prepared from skim milk , a waste product of the dairies . The sugar of milk is a valuable product for use in the preparation of modified milk for infants ; in medicine it is of importance as an excipient , or vehicle for active remedies ; and in certain diseases it is a valuable nutrient . There is little probability that the use of milk sugar will ever become as universal as that of the other forms of sugar , for the price , from twenty to forty cents a pound , is prohibitive . The chief adulterants to be looked for in milk sugar are grape sugar and cane sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , the annual production as reported in I900 being 61,196,16o pounds . It is said , especially by English analysts , that much American honey is entirely artificial , that the comb is made of paraffin and filled with glucose syrup . Two simple tests will show whether this is the case . Normal honey , being collected by the bees from flowers , will contain many pollen grains . The absence of these is a suspicious circumstance . Beeswax is blackened by warm sulphuric acid , while paraffin is not affected . The most common adulterants of honey are cane sugar and commercial glucose . Gelatin is also found . Sometimes bees are fed on cane sugar or glucose , which is placed near the hives . In such a case they may supply the adulterants . The presence of the comb in honey is by no means // a proof of genuineness . In at least one sample the Massachusetts State Board of Health found pieces of artificial comb and a dead bee in a mixture of glucose and cane sugar . In the Bulletin of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given showing that out of thirteen samples examined , only seven were of legal quality . ADULTERATION The adulteration of sugar may be considered under three heads . First , the addition of insoluble substances , such as marble dust , which is sometimes found advertised among the supplies of confectioners . It is said that sand used to be added . Second , the foreign substances left in from the process of manufacture , such as ultramarine , to give the requisite blue color . If tin were ever found in sugar , it would be in this list . Third , and most frequent at present , is the addition of glucose , or corn sugar , which is much cheaper , but is less sweet , partly on account of its lesser solubility in water . One quart of water dissolves three pounds of cane sugar , but only one or one and a half pounds of grape sugar . Sugar may be so manipulated in refining as to be white and crystalline , and yet contain quite a percentage of moisture and syrup . Such sugar cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as an adulteration . The adulteration of the granulated and powdered sugars , at least those sold in the Eastern States , is not as extensive as has been supposed . Of the samAND // pies examined by the writer in 1879 , not one of seventy-three samples from Massachusetts , not one of five from New York , and only one of twelve from Chicago was adulterated . Today ( 1906 ) granulated sugar is probably the purest food product on the market . Syrups , on the contrary , are very liable to be not what they seem . Dr. Kedzie , of Michigan , in 1879 found only one out of twenty-one genuine . The Kansas Board of Health , in its Bulletin for June , 1906 , states the percentage of adulteration in maple sugar and syrup as 95.8 . The July Bulletin from New Hampshire , the home of the sugar maple , gives only twenty-one samples of legal quality out of forty-one examined . The usual adulterants of maple syrup are golden or drip syrup , commercial glucose , molasses , and refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn syrup . CANDY The enormous extension ' of the candy trade demands attention both from the hygienic and the economic point of view . Some years ago Professor Simon N. Patten warned us that we were being eliminated on a sugar diet ? women particularly . With the best granulated sugar at say six cents a pound , and commercial glucose at about half that price , the sale of candies at forty to eighty cents means large profits , which are to a great extent used up in fancy boxes , high rents , and expert // service , so that even at fifteen cents a pound it is possible to sell candies where other expenses are low . A large part of the tons of candy purchased by the young people of our towns is glucose more or less bleached by bisulphite of soda . . Commercial glucose of the unrefined sort as it comes from the factory to be used , in beer , for instance , has a yellow cast , and would not sell so readily ; hence the bleaching . Glucose itself is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fancy for brilliant colors in food finds full play in candies . Some 200 coloring substances are named in the National Confectioners ' Association list , of which about one-third are recognized as harmful . Mineral colors , such as lead chromate ( yellow ) , formerly frequent , are rarely seen . Coal tar dyes , from their intense coloring power , are generally used . The quantity taken at any one time is almost infinitesimal . Cheap candies are sometimes stuffed with starch , paste , and paraffin , and the fats used are of doubtful sources . " Brandy drops " containing fusel oil and alcohol ought to be driven from the market . In 1900 thirty-one out of seventy-eight samples of confectionery examined in Massachusetts were adulterated . Chocolate brandy drops gave in some cases more than 4 per cent of alcohol . The Inland Revenue Department , Ottawa , Canada , reports the following results of an examination of highly colored- confectionery , samples having been collected during two months : Out of fifty-six samples examined thirty-four contained two colors , twenty contained three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one sample was the presence of arsenic shown , and that in such minute quantity as to be completely harmless . USES OF SUGAR In Europe it was used only in medicine until about the fifteenth century , and it was not produced in large quantities till about 1800 . Only within a few generations has sugar been used as a food , and produced in sufficient quantities to bring the price within the reach of all classes of people . The consumption of sugar is everywhere increasing . In 1899 the total consumption was from seven to eight million tons . In 1904 it was from eleven to twelve million . In the United States alone it was nearly three million , having increased from eight pounds a head in 1825 to 75.3 pounds in 1904 . Until recently , taking the world as a whole , it ' might be said that sugar was used as a condiment rather than as a food , but at present it seems a very important article of diet , and should be so considered . It would seem that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sometimes can be obtained only with great difficulty . It is known that the consumption of sugar is large among American farmers and lumbermen . In Switzerland loaf sugar and very sweet chocolate are important elements in the outfits of mountain climbers , and on all polar expeditions sugar is considered an essential . Undoubtedly it is an invaluable as well as an agreeable food for these dwellers in the open air . Professor Pfluger is quoted as saying that without doubt the sugar in the blood is heavily drawn on during
