txt After deliberating for an hour and a half at the close of a trim lasting eight weeks , the jury which has been hearing the case against the American Ice Corn-. pany announced late yesterday afternoon that it had found the company guilty of attempting to create a monopoly on both counts of the indictment . The Grand Jury 's investigations preceding this verdict date as far back as 1900 . John B. Stanchfield , counsel for the defense , immediately moved for an arrest of judgment and a new trial , when he heard the verdict . These were denied , and Supreme Court Justice Wheeler then imposed a fine of $11,000 on the two eounts'in the indictment . Justice Wheeler said afterward that it would be impossible to predict accurately the result that would follow the imposition of the fine . " I regret that I could not make the penalty more , " he said , " hut other things may be looked for . I believe that the conviction will have a healthful effect and serve as a warning to similar offenders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Appellate Division , in which is Involved the license of the American to do business in this State , and this verdict may justify the Executive in revoking that license without more Sao . Mr. Stanchfield himself told the jury that a conviction would mean the death of the company and an irreparable injury to its many stockholders . " Then , too , there are many contracts with independents which the jury has marked as part of an illegal arrangement . They therefore become illegal in themselves , and this might encourage those who agree to stay out of the business to re-enter it without fear of litigation . I have greatly enjoyed the case and shall return to Buffalo to-morrow night very glad that Gov . Hughes assigned tae to the hearing of it . " First State Antl-Trust Snit . " This is the first criminal prosecution under the Donnelly Anti-Monopoly act which has been on the statute books since 1899 , " said James W. Osborne yesterday morning when he continued the ramming up for the prosecution . " The State law is stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in addition to conspiracy and contract ' in restraint of trade , and , therefore , it is applicable to monopolies attempted by a single party or a single corporation . " A monopoly , as the defense has itself defined it , is such a degree of power that it enables you substantially . to control the situation , and did not the American Ice Company have such a control when it sold ice at $3 a ton in 1908 , when it could sell it at a profit for $1.202 I claim that they tried to create a monopoly , and I claim that at times they succeeded sufficiently to interfere with the ebb and flow of the tides of business . This corporation has been an Ice gorge , and the jury will be the means of breaking- it ape ' Justice Wheeler 's Charge . in charging the jury Justice Wheeler said in part : " This court does not understand that tile act substantially changes the provisions of the common and unwritten law ae it existed prior to the passage of this statute . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that which was before declared by the common and unwritten law illegal and void . If the provisions or agreements in restraint of competition go beyond measurer of self-protection and threaten the public good in a distinct , ly appreciable degree they are to be restrained . " if toe purchase of a business with a restrictive agreement against re-engaging in ice was made for the sole purpose of acquiring the business sold , and with no ulterior purpose of establishing a monopoly , then doubtless it would be an innocent transaction in the eye of the law . If . however , on the other hand , in taking and eXaeting from the seller these agreements ttie American Ice Company pro ' cured and made these agreements with ' the purpose of creating a monopoly , so as to be able to control prices , then these contracts become and are illegal agreements . They violate not only the statute but also the common law as it existed prior to the enactment of the statute . " Limitations Statute No Bar . The chief line of defense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to the Appellate ' Division , was the fact that the contracts were made more than two years ago , and are therefore barred by the Statute of Lama I talons . On this point Justice Wheeler said : " If the illegal arrangement charged in this case was made and entered into more than two years prior to June 19 , 1908 , and the matter ? ended teiere , without the commission of further acts by the defendant to effectuate that arrangement , it is your duty to acquit the defendant . But if you find that after making such an illegal arrangement the defendant , subsequent to June 10 , 190G , did acts pursuant to or in or toward or for the consummation thereof , ' then it is guilty of the offense charged , and the Statute of Limitations is no bar to its conviction . " Jurors Congratulate Osborne . The jury retired at twenty minutes after 4 . When it had returned with its verdict , at five minutes before 0 , the twelve men rushed pell-mell for Mr. Osborne . who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial , ' and there was much hand-shaking and expressions of . satisfaction . In this general rejoicing . Mr. Stanchfield and Thomas D. Adams , counsel fur the Ice Trust , took no active part , and President Oler was not there at all . He was an unfailing spectator of the proceedings until the prosecution began to sum up , when he quietly left the room and has not been seen there since . It was remarked among the departing jurors that he must have been gifted with a sense of prophecy and foreseen the withering arraignment which he received from Mr. Osborne , who referred to him as " Dr. Oler , , with his s ? ecific warranted to cure all corners of that dread disease known is Independence . " " It is a cause c ? l ? bre , " said Mr. Osborne to the friends who gathered around him , " and to me , it has ever been a cause rather than a case . Ever since 1899 I have longed to see that statute brought I before a jury for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked on It . dreamt ice , thought ice , lived Ice . "
