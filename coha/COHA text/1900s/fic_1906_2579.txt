A GOOD SAMARITAN by MARY RAYMOND SHIPMAN ANDREWS Illustrated by Charlotte Harding New York McClure , Phillips &; Co . Second Impression MCMVI LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS " That 'll get even Webster 's Union for chargin ' me two cents for ' soon , ' " he chuckled " Recky , " he bubbled , " good old Recky -- bes ' fren ' ev ' had " " Who 's your friend , Billy ? " " Thank you -- thank you very much -- very , very much -- old rhinoceros " " So tired , " he remarked . " Go'n have good nap now " " Could he -- could n't he ? " At every station the conductor and Rex had to reason with him A GOOD SAMARITAN The little District Telegraph boy , with a dirty face , stood at the edge of the desk , and , rubbing his sleeve across his cheek , made it unnecessarily dirtier . " Answer , sir ? " " No -- yes -- wait a minute . " Reed tore the yellow envelope and spread the telegram . It read : " Do I meet you at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The devil ! " Reed commented , and the boy blinked indifferently . He was used to stronger . " The casual Rex all over ! Yes , boy , there 's an answer . " He scribbled rapidly , and the two lines of writing said this : " Waiting for you at office now . Hurry up . C. Reed . " He fumbled in his pocket and gave the youngster a coin . " See that it 's sent instantly -- like lightning . Run ! " and the sharp little son of New York was off before the last word was well out . Half an hour later , to Reed waiting at his office in Broadway impatiently , there strolled in a good-looking and leisurely young man with black clothes on his back and peace and good-will on his face . " Hope I have n't kept you waiting , Carty , " he remarked in friendly tones . " Plenty of time , is n't there ? " " No , there is n't , " his cousin answered , and there was a touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ought to grow up and be responsible . It was distinctly arranged that you should call here for me at six , and now it 's a quarter before seven . " " Could n't remember the hour or the place to save my life , " the younger man asserted earnestly . " I 'm just as sorry as I can be , Carty . You see I did remember we were to dine at Martin 's . So much I got all right -- and that was something , was n't it , Carty ? " he inquired with an air of wistful pride , and the frown on the face of the other dissolved in laughter . " Rex , there 's no making you over -- worse luck . Come along . I 've got to go home to dress after dinner you see , before we make our call . You 'll do , on the strength of being a theological student . " The situation was this : Reginald Fairfax , in his last year at the Theological Seminary , in this month of May , and lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rector of the great church of St. Eric 's . It was a remarkable position to come the way of an undergraduate , and his brilliant record at the seminary was one of the two things which made it possible . The other was the friendship and interest of his cousin , Carter Reed , head clerk in the law firm of Rush , Walden , Lee and Lee , whose leading member , Judge Rush , was also senior warden at St. Eric 's . Reed had called Judge Rush 's attention to his young cousin 's career , and , after some inquiry , the vestryman had asked that the young man should be brought to see him , to discuss certain questions bearing on the work . It was almost equivalent to a call coming from such a man , and Reed was delighted ; but here his troubles began . In vain did he hopefully fix date after date with the slippery Rex -- something always interfered . Twice , to his knowledge , it had been the chance of seeing a girl from Orange which had thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Once the evening had been definitely arranged with Judge Rush himself , and Reed was obliged to go alone and report that the candidate had disappeared into a tenement district and no one knew where to find him . The effect of that was fortunately good -- Judge Rush was rather pleased than otherwise that a young clergyman should be so taken up with his work as to forget his interests . But Reed was most anxious that this evening 's appointment should go off successfully , while Rex was as light-hearted as a bird . Any one would have thought it was Reed 's own future he was laboring over instead of that of the youngster who had a gift of making men care for him and work for him without effort on his own part . The two walked down Broadway toward the elevated road , Rex 's dark eyes gathering amusement here and there in the crowded way as they went . " Look at Billy Strong -- why there 's Billy Strong across the street . Come over and I 'll present you , Carty . Just the chap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water-polo team of the New York Athletic Club , you know -- as much of an old sport as you are . " And Reed found himself swung across and standing before a powerful , big figure of a man , almost before he could answer . There was another man with the distinguished Billy , and Reed had not regarded the two for more than one second before he discovered that they were both in a distinct state of intoxication . In fact , Strong proclaimed the truth at once , false shame cast to the winds . He threw his arm about Rex 's neck with a force of affection which almost knocked down the quartette . " Recky , " he bubbled , " good old Recky -- bes ' fren ' ev ' had -- I 'm drunk , Recky -- too bad . We 're both drunk . Take 's home . " Rex glanced at his cousin in dismay , and Strong repeated his invitation cordially . " Take 's home , Recky , " he insisted , with the easy air of a man who confers an honor . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his frowning cousin doubtfully , pleadingly . " It almost seems as if it was , does n't it , Carty ? " he said . " We ca n't leave them like this . " " I do n't see why we can't -- I can , " Reed asserted . " It 's none of our business , Rex , and we really have n't time to palaver . Come along . " Illustration : " Recky , " he bubbled , " good old Recky -- bes ' fren ' ev ' had " The gentle soul of Rex Fairfax was surprisingly firm . " Carty , they 'd be arrested in five minutes , " he reasoned . " It 's a wonder they have n't been already . And Billy 's people -- it would break their hearts . I know some of them well , you see . I was with him only last week over in Orange . " " Oh ! " Reed groaned . " That Girl from Orange again . " He opened his lips once more to launch nervous English against this quixotism , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he solemnly stated , fixing his eyes rollingly on Reed . " Got Orange-colored cousin what break Recky 's heart if do n't take 's home . Y'see -- y'see --  " The President of these United States in a cabinet council would have stopped to listen to him , so freighted with great facts coming was his confidential manner . " Y'see -- would n't tell ev'body -- only you , " and he laid a mighty hand on Reed 's shoulder . " I 'm so drunk . Awful pity -- too bad , " and he sighed deeply . " Now , Recky , ol ' man , take 's home . " " Who 's your friend , Billy ? " Rex inquired , disregarding this appeal . Billy burst into a shout of laughter which Fairfax promptly clipped by putting his hand over the big man 's mouth . " He 's bes ' joke yet , " Strong remarked through Rex 's fingers . " He 's go'n ' kill himself , " and he kissed the restraining hand gallantly . The two sober citizens turned and stared at the gentlemen . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step deeper into the gloom which enveloped him , except suicide . He nodded darkly as the two regarded him . " Uh-huh . Life 's failure . Lost cuff-button . Wo n't live to be indecent . Go'n ' kill m'self soon 's this dizhiness goesh pasht . Billy 's drunk , but I 'm subject to -- to dizhiness . " Rex turned to his cousin with a gesture . " You see , Carty , we ca n't leave them . I 'm just as disappointed as you are , but it would be a beastly thing to do , to let them get pulled in as common drunks . What 's your friend 's name ? " he demanded again of Strong . Illustration : " Who 's your friend , Billy ? " " Got lovely name , " he averred eagerly . " Good ol ' moth-eaten name . Name 's Schuyler VanCourtlandt Van de Water -- ai n't it Schuylie -- ai n't that your name -- or 's that mine ? I -- I f'rget lil ' things , " he said in an explanatory manner . But the suicide spoke up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said aggressively . " Knew it in a minute . Tha 's my father 's name and my grandfath 's name , and my great grandfath 's name and my great-great --  --  " " Stop , " said Rex tersely , and the man stopped . " Now tell me where you live . " Billy Strong leaned over and punched the man in the ribs . " You lemme tell ' em . Lives nine-thous-n sixt ' - four East West Street , " he addressed Rex , and chuckled . " Do n't be a donkey , Billy -- tell me his right address . " Rex spoke with annoyance -- this scene was getting tiresome , and although Reed was laughing hopelessly , he was on his mind . " Oh ! F'got ! " Billy 's tipsy coyness was elephantine . " Lives six thous'n sev'nty four North S -- South Street , " and he roared with laughter . Rex was about to learn how to manage Billy Strong . " Bill , " he said , " be decent . You 're making me lots of trouble , " and Billy burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble for worlds -- good ol ' Recky -- half-witted ol ' goat , but bes ' fren ' ev ' had , " and the address was captured . Rex turned to his cousin , his winning , deprecating manner warning Reed but softening him against his will . " Carty , " he said , " there 's nothing for it , but for you to take one chap and I the other and see ' em home . It 's only a little after seven and we ought to be able to meet by half-past eight -- at the Hotel Netherland , say -- that 's near the Rush 's . We 'll have to give up dinner , but we 'll get a sandwich somewhere , and we 'll do . I 'll take Strong because he 's more troublesome -- I think I can manage him . It 's awfully good of you , and I can tell you I appreciate it . But it would n't be civilized to do less , old Carty , would it ? " And Reed found himself , grumbling but docile , linked to the suicide 's arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . " Now , we 'll both kill ourselves , old Carty , wo n't we ? " Rex heard his cousin 's charge mumble cheerfully as they started off , with a visible lengthening of his gloom at the thought of companionship at death . Strong was marching along with an unearthly decorum that should have made Fairfax suspicious . But instead it cheered his optimistic soul immensely . " Good for you old man , " he said encouragingly . " At this rate we 'll get you home in no time . " And Billy , at that second , thrust out his great shoulder into the crowd , and almost knocked a man down . The man , whirled sidewise in front of them , glared savagely . " What do you mean by that ? " he demanded . Strong , to whom nothing would have given more joy than a tussle , bent down and peered into the other 's face . " Is it a man or a monkey ? " he piped , and shrieked with laughter . The man 's strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was about to spring for Strong , and promptly threw himself between the two . " Look here , Billy , " he remonstrated , " if you fight anybody it 's got to be me , " and he spoke over his shoulder to the stranger . " You see what I 'm up against . I 'm getting him home -- do just go on , " and the man went . But Billy 's head was in his guardian 's neck and he was spluttering and sobbing . " Fight you ? Nev '  - -  s ' help me -- nev '  - -  Fight poor , ole fool Recky -- bes ' fren ' ev ' had ? No sir . I wouldn ' fight you Recky , " and he raised a tear-stained face and gazed mournfully into his eyes . " D'ye think I'd --  --  " " Oh , shut up ! " Rex ejaculated , " and hold your head up , Billy . You make me sick . " The intoxicated heavy freight being under way again , Rex looked about for the rest of the train , but in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that they were lost and would have to stay lost , the situation being too precarious , in this land of policemen , with one hundred and ninety pounds of noisy uncertainty on his hands , to risk any unnecessary movement . Billy kept every breath of time alive and varied . Within two minutes of the first adventure he managed to put his elbow clearly and forcibly into a small man 's mouth , and before the other could resent it : " ' S my elbow , sir , " he said , haughtily , stopping and staring down . " Well , why in thunder do n't you keep it where it belongs ? " snapped the man , and Billy caught him by the sleeve . " Lil ' sir , " he said impressively , " if you should bite off my elbow , you saucy baggage "  - -  and the thought was too much for him . Tears filling his eyes he turned to Rex . " Recky , you spank that lil ' sir , " he pleaded brokenly . " He 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditated again . A shock came when they reached the corner of Broadway and Chambers Street . " Up 's ' daisy , " crowed Billy Strong , and swung Fairfax facing uptown with a mighty heave . " The Elevated station 's down a block , old chap , " explained the sober contingent . " We have to take the Elevated to Seventy-second you know , and walk across to your place . " Billy looked at him pityingly . " You poor lil ' pup , " he crooned . " Didn ' I keep tellin ' you had to go Chris'pher Street ferry meet a girl ? Goin ' theater with girl . " He tipped his derby one-sided and started off on a cakewalk . Rex had to march beside him willy-nilly . " Look here , Billy , " he reasoned , exasperated at this entirely fresh twist in the corkscrew business of getting Strong home . " Look here , Billy , this is tommy-rot . You have n't any date with a girl , and if you had you could n't keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for you . " But Billy was suddenly a Gibraltar of firmness . " Got date with lovely blue-eyed girlie -- could n't dish'point her . Unmanly deed -- Recky , d ' you want bes ' fren ' ev ' had to do unmanly deed , and dish'point trustin ' female ? Nev ' , Recky -- nev ' , ol ' man . Lesh be true to th ' ladies till hell runs dry -- Oh , ' scuse me Recky -- f'got you was parson -- till well runs dry , meant say . That all right ? Come on t ' Chris'pher Street . " And in spite of desperate attempts , of long argument and appeal on Rex 's part , to Christopher Street they went . The ministering angel had no hankering to risk his charge in a street-car , so , as the distance was not great , they walked . Fairfax 's dread was that , having saved his friend so far , he should attract the attention of a policeman and be arrested . So he kept a sharp lookout for bluecoats and passed them studiously on the other side . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely into the majestic arm of the law , and what was his greater horror , to hear Billy Strong suavely address him . Billy lifted his hat to the large , fat officer as he might have lifted it to his sweetheart in her box at the Horse Show . " Would you have the g -- goodness to tell me , " he inquired , with distinguished courtesy , " if this is "  - -  Billy 's articulation was improving , but otherwise he was just as tipsy as ever --  " if this is -- Chris-to-pher Street -- or -- or Wednesday ? " " Hey ? " inquired the policeman , and stared . Repartee seemed not to be his forte . " Thank you -- thank you very much "  - -  Billy 's gratitude spilled over conventional limits --  " very , very much -- old rhinoceros , " he finished , and shot suddenly ahead , dragging Rex with him into the whirlpool of a moving crowd , and it dawned on the policeman five minutes later that the courtly gentleman was drunk . Illustration : " Thank you -- thank you very much -- very , very much -- old rhinoceros " The anxiety of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hand grew playful , after the fashion of a mammoth kitten . He bounded this way and that , knocking into somebody inevitably at every leap , and at each contact he wheeled toward the injured and lifted his hat and bowed low and brought out " I -- beg -- your -- pardon " with a drawl of sarcastic emphasis too insulting to be described . " Billy , " pleaded Rex , taking to pathos , " do n't do that again . You 'll get arrested , and maybe they 'll arrest me too , and you do n't want to get me into a hole , do you ? " Billy stopped short with a suddenness which came near to upsetting his guide , and put both large hands on Rex 's shoulders , and gazed into his eyes with a world of blurred affection . " Reck , ol'fel ' , " and his voice broke with a sob , " if I got you into hole , I 'd jump in hole after you , and I'd -- and I'd -- pull hole in after both of us , and then I'd -- I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , and --  --  " " Come along and behave , " cut in the victim of this devotion shortly . " Do n't be a fool . " Strong lifted a fatherly forefinger . " Naughty naughty ! Shouldn ' call brother fool . Danger hell fire if you call brother fool . Nev ' min ' , Recky -- we un'stand each other . Two fools . I 'm go'n behave . " He knocked his derby in the back so it rested on his nose , stuck his chin up to meet it , and started off in the most unmistakable semblance of a tipsy man to be met anywhere . " See me behavin ' ? " he remarked sidewise , with a gleam of rollicking deviltry out of his eyes . Christopher Street ferry was reached safely by a miracle , and inside the ferry-house Strong made a bee line for a truck and threw his great body full length upon it with a loud yawn of joy . " So tired , " he remarked . " Go'n have good nap now , " and he closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't do . You said you had to meet a girl -- what about that ? " Illustration : " So tired " he remarked . " Go'n have good nap now " " Oh , tha 's all right , " Billy agreed easily . " You meet girl -- tell her you got me drunk , " and he turned over and prepared for slumber . Strenuous argument was necessary to rouse him even to half a sense of responsibility . " Recky , dear , you -- 'noy me , " he said with severity , coming to a sitting position and contemplating Rex with mild displeasure . " What kin ' girl ? Why , jes ' girly-girl . Lovely blue-eyed girly-girl -- kind of girl -- colored hair , "  - -  he swept his hand descriptively over his own black locks . " Wears sort of -- skirts , you know -- you ' member the kind . All of ' em same thing -- well , she wears ' em too . Tha 's all , " and he dropped heavily back to the truck and retired into his coat collar . Rex shook him . " That wo n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that . Will there be a chaperone with her ? " " No ! " thundered Billy . " How is a girl allowed to go to the theater with you without a chaperone ? " inquired Rex incredulously . " This is New York . " Strong brought down his fist . " Death to chaperones ! A bas les chaperones ! Do n't you think girl 's mother trust her to me ? Look at me ! I 'll be chaperone to tha ' girl , and father , ' n ' mother , ' n ' a few uncles and aunts . " He threw his arm out with a gesture which comprised the universe . " I 'll be all the world to tha ' girl . You go meet her ' n ' tell her you got me drunk , " he concluded with a radiant smile . Rex considered . There seemed to be enough method in Strong 's madness to justify the belief that he had an engagement . If so , he must by all means wait and trust to luck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " party of the other part , " and hope for an inspiration as to what to tell her . She might be with or without a chaperone , she might be any variety of the species , but Strong seemed to be quite clear that she had blue eyes . The crowd from the incoming boat began to unload into the ferry-house , and Rex placed himself anxiously by the entrance . Three or four thin men scurried in advance , then a bunch of stout and middle-aged persons straggled along puffing . Then came a set of young people in theater array , chattering and laughing as they hurried , and another set , and another -- the main body of the little army was upon him . Rex scanned them for a girl alone or a girl with her mother . Ah ! here she was -- this must be Strong 's " blue-eyed girlie . " She was alone and pretty , a little under-bred and blond . Rex lifted his hat . " I beg your pardon , " he said , in his most winning way ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw up her head and looked frightened , and then angry . " No , I am not , " she said , and then , with a haughty look , " I call you pretty saucy , " and Rex was left mortified and silent , while a passing man murmured , " Served you right , " and a woman laughed scornfully . He stalked across to the tranquil form on the truck . " Billy , " he said , and shook a massive shoulder . " Wake up . Tell me that girl 's name . " Strong opened his eyes like a baby waked from dewy sleep . " Wha 's that , Recky -- dear old Recky -- bes ' fren '  - -   - -   " " Cut that out , " said Rex , sharply . " Tell me the name of the girl you 're waiting here to meet , " and he laughed a short bitter laugh . The girl whom " Billy " was waiting to meet ! Rex was getting tired and hungry . Strong smiled a gentle , obstinate , tipsy smile and shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fren '  - -  bes ' fren ' well , nev ' min ' . Ca n't tell girl 's name ; tha 's her secret . " " Do n't be an ass , Billy -- quick , now , tell me the name . " " Naughty , naughty ! " quoted Billy again , and waggled his forefinger . " Danger hell fire ! Couldn ' tell girl 's name , Recky -- be dishon'able . Couldn ' , no , couldn ' . Anythin ' else -- ask m ' anythin ' else in all these wide worlds "  - -  and he struck his breast with fervor . " Tell you anythin ' , Recky , but couldn ' betray trustin ' girl 's secret . " " Billy , ca n't you give me an idea what the girl 's like ? " pleaded Rex desperately . Billy smiled up at him drowsily . " Perfectly good girl , " he elucidated . " Good eyes , good wind , kind to mother -- perfectly good girl in ev -- every r-respect , " he concluded , emphasizing his sentences by articulating them . He dropped his chin into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described an impressive semicircle . " Present to her ' surances my most disting'shed consider-ration -- soon 's you find her , " and he went flop on his side and was asleep . Rex had to give it up . He heard the gates rattling open for the next boat-load , and took his stand again , bracing himself for another rebuff . The usual vanguard , the usual quicksilver bunch of humanity , massing , separating , flowing this way and that , and in the midst of them a fair-haired , timid-looking young girl , walking quietly with down-cast eyes , as if unused to being in big New York alone at eight o'clock at night . Rex stood in front of her with bared head . " I beg your pardon , " he repeated his formula ; " are you looking for Mr. Strong ? " The startled eyes lifted to his a short second , then dropped again . " No , for Mr. Week , " she answered softly , and unconscious of witticism , melted into the throng . This was a heavy boat-load , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And suddenly his heart bounded and stopped . Of course -- he was utterly foolish not to have known -- it was she -- Billy Strong 's bewitching cousin , the girl from Orange . There she stood with her big , brown eyes searching , gazing here and there , as lovely , as incongruous as a wood-nymph strayed into a political meeting . The feather of her hat tossed in the May breeze ; the fading light from the window behind her shone through loose hair about her face , turned it into a soft dark aureole ; the gray of her tailor gown was crisp and fresh as spring-time . To Rex 's eyes no picture had ever been more satisfying . Suddenly she caught sight of him , and her face lighted as if lamps had shone out of a twilight , and in a second he had her hand in his , and was talking away , with responsibility and worry , and that heavy weight on the truck back there , quite gone out of the world . She was in it , and himself -- the world was full . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , for it was quite two minutes , and the last straggler from the boat had disappeared into the street before she broke into one of his sentences . " Why , but -- I forgot . You made me forget entirely , Mr. Fairfax . I 'm going to the theater with my cousin , Billy Strong . He ought to be here -- where is he ? " Rex shivered lest her roving eyes might answer the question , for Billy 's truck with Billy slumbering peacefully on it , lay in full view not fifty feet away . But her gaze passed unsuspiciously over the prostrate , huddled form . " It 's very queer -- I 'm sure this was the right boat . " She looked up at his face anxiously , and he almost moaned aloud . What was he going to say to her ? " That 's what I 'm here for , Miss Margery -- to explain about Billy . He -- he is n't feeling at all himself to-night , and it 's utterly impossible for him to go with you . " To his astonishment her face broke into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry Billy 's ill , but we 'll hope for the best , and I wo n't really object to you as a substitute , you know . Of course it 's improper , and mother would n't think of letting me go with you -- but I 'm going . Mother wo n't mind when I tell her it 's done . I 've never been alone with a man to anything , except with my cousin -- it 's like stealing watermelons , is n't it ? Do n't you think it 's rather fun ? " Staggered by the situation , Fairfax thought desperately and murmured something which sounded like " Oochee-Goochee , " as he tried to recall it later . The girl 's gay voice went on : " It would be wicked to waste the tickets . City people are n't going to the theater as late as this , so we wo n't see any one we know . I think it 's a dispensation of Providence , and I 'd be a poor-spirited mouse to waste the chance . I think I 'll go with you -- do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Could he leave that prostrate form on the truck and snatch at this bit of heaven dangling before him ? Could he -- Could n't he ? No , he could not . It would be a question of fifteen minutes perhaps before the drowsy Billy would be marching to the police station , and in his entirely casual and fearless state of mind , the big athlete would make history for some policeman , his friend could not doubt , before he got there . Rex had put his hand to this intoxicated plow and he must not look back , even when the prospect backwards was so bewilderingly attractive , so tantalizingly easy . He stammered badly when , at length , the silence which followed the soft voice had to be filled . " I 'm simply -- simply -- broken up , Miss Margery , " and the girl 's eyes looked at him with a sweet wideness that made it harder . " I do n't know how to tell you , and I do n't know how to resign myself to it either , but I -- I ca n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see , I 've got to be with Billy . " She spoke quickly at that . " Mr. Fairfax , is Billy really ill -- is there something more than I understand ? Why did n't you tell me ? Has their been an accident , perhaps ? Why , I must go to him too -- come -- hurry -- I 'll go with you , of course . " Rex stumbled again in his effort to quiet her alarm , to prevent this scheme of seeking Billy on his couch of pain . " Oh no , indeed you must n't do that , " he objected strenuously . " I could n't let you , you know . I do n't want you to be bothered . Billy is n't ill at all -- there has n't been any accident , I give you my word . He 's all right -- Billy 's all right . " He had quite lost his prospective by now , and did not see the rocks upon which he rushed . " If Billy 's all right , why is n't he here ? " demanded Billy 's cousin severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say -- all right , you know . You see how it is , " and he gazed involuntarily at the sleeping giant huddled on the truck . " I do not see . " The brown eyes had never looked at him so coldly before , and their expression cut him . " I 'm glad you do n't , " he cried , and realized that the words had taken him a step deeper into trouble . " It 's just this way , Miss Margery -- Billy is n't hurt or ill , but he isn't -- is n't feeling quite himself , and -- and I 've got to -- I 've got to be with him . " His voice sounded as if he were going to cry , but it moved the girl to no pity . " Oh ! " she said , and her bewildered tone was a whole world removed from the bright comradeship with which she had met him . " I see -- you and Billy have something else planned . " Her face flushed suddenly . " I 'm sorry I misunderstood about -- about the theater . I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , embarrassed , hurt , but yet with her graceful dignity untouched . " Oh , " the wretched Rex exclaimed impetuously , " if I could only take you to the theater , I 'd rather than --  " but the girl stopped him . " Never mind about that , please , " she said , with gentle decision . " I must go home -- when is the next boat ? One is going now -- good-night , Mr. Fairfax -- no , do n't come with me -- I do n't need you , " and she was gone . Two minutes later Strong 's innocent slumbers were dispersed by a vicious shake . " Wake up ! wake up ! " ordered Fairfax , restraining himself with difficulty from mangling the cause of his sufferings . " I 've had enough , and we 're going home , straight . " Rex was mistaken about that , but Billy was cordial in agreeing with him . " Good idea , Recky ! Howd'y ' ever come to think of it ? Le 's go home straight ; tha 's a bully good thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , ol ' boy , " and yawning still , but with unperturbed good nature , Strong marched , a bit crookedly , arm in arm with his friend to the street . Illustration : At every station the conductor and Rex had to reason with him Rex 's memory of the trip uptown on the Elevated was like an evil dream . Strong , after his nap , was as a giant refreshed , and his play of wit knew no contracting limits . There were , luckily , not many passengers going up at this hour , but the dozen or so on the car were regaled . Billy selected a seat on the floor with his broad back planted against the door , and at every station the conductor and Rex had to reason with him at length before the door could be opened . The official threatened as well as he could for laughing to put him off , but he threatened less strenuously for the sight of six feet two of muscle in magnificently fit condition . This lasted for half a dozen stations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took a strap on either side of the car and turned somersaults ; he did traveling ring work with them ; he gave a standing broad jump that would have been creditable on an athletic field ; he had his audience screaming with laughter at an imitation of water polo over the back of a seat . Then , just as the fun was at an almost impossible point , and the conductor , highly entertained but worried , was considering how to get this chap arrested , Billy walked up to him with charming friendliness and shook hands . " One th ' besh track meets I 've ever had pleasure attendin ' , sir , " he said genially , and sat down and relapsed into grave dignity . So he remained for five minutes , to the trembling joy of his exhausted guardian , but it was too good to be true . Suddenly , at Fifty-third Street , he spied a young woman at the other end of the car . There were not more than nine passengers , so that each person might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Strong suddenly felt a demand on his politeness , and reason was nothing to him . He rose and marched the forty feet or so between himself and the woman , and , standing in front of her , lifted , with some difficulty , his hat . " Wo n't you take my seat , madam ? " he inquired , with a smile of perfect courtesy . The young person was a young person of common-sense and she caught the situation . She flashed a reassuring glance at Rex , hovering distressed in the background , and shook her head at Strong politely . " No -- no , thank you , " she said ; " I think I can find a seat at this end that will do nicely . " " Madam , I insist , " Strong addressed her again earnestly . " No , really , " The young woman was embarrassed , for the eyes of the car were on her . " Thank you so much , " she said finally ; " I think I 'd better stay here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm . " Madam , as gen'leman I can not , can not allow it . Madam , you mush take my seat . Pleash , madam , do not make scene . ' S pleasure to me , ' sure you -- greates ' pleasure , " and beneath this courtly urgency the flushed girl walked shamefacedly the length of the almost empty car , and sat down in Strong 's seat , while that soul of chivalry put his hand through a strap and so stood till his ministering angel extracted him from the train at Seventy-second Street . With a sigh of heartfelt relief , Rex put his arm in the big fellow 's at the foot of the steps . Freedom must now be at hand , for Billy 's home was in a great apartment building not ten minutes ' walk away . The culprit himself seemed to realize that his fling was over . " Raished Cain t'night , didn ' we , ol ' pal ? " he inquired , and squeezed Rex 's guiding arm with affection . " I 'll shay this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may be half-witted donkey -- I 'm not denyin ' all that ' n more , but I 'll shay thish -- you 're the bes ' man to go on a drunk with in -- in -- in The'logican Sem'nary . I 'm not ' xceptin ' th '  - -   - -   " " Shut up , Billy , " remarked Rex , not for the first time that night . " I 'd get myself pulled together a bit if I were you , " he advised . " You 're going to see your family in a minute . " " M ' poor fam'ly ! " mourned Strong , shaking his head . " M ' poor fam'ly ! Thish 'll be awful blow to m ' fam'ly , Recky . They all like so mush to see me sober -- always --  's their fad , Recky . Do n't blame ' em , Recky , ' s natural to ' em . Some peop ' born that way . M ' poor fam'ly . " They stood in front of the broad driveway which swept under lofty arches into the huge apartment house . Strong stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he murmured , pointing skywards --  " M ' fam'ly . " The tears were streaming down his face frankly now . " I ca n't face ' em Recky , ' n this condition you 've got me in , " he said more in sorrow than in anger . At that second the last inspiration of the evening caught him . Across the street arose the mighty pile of an enormous uptown hotel . Strong jerked his thumb over his shoulder . " Go'n ' break it to m ' fam'ly by telegraph ' ' em , " he stated , and bitterly Rex repented of that thoughtless mention of the Strongs to their son and heir . Good-naturedly as he had done everything , but relentlessly , he dragged his victim over the way , and direct to the Western Union office of the hotel --  " Webster 's Union " he preferred to call it . His first telegram read : " Rex Fairfax got me drunk . Do n't blame him . It 's natural to him . " That one was confiscated , Strong complaining gently that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message was this : " Dear Mama : Billy 's intoxicated . Awfully sorry . Could n't be helped . Home soon . " That one went in spite of Fairfax 's efforts , with two cents extra to pay , which item was the first event of the evening to ruffle Strong 's temper . " Shame , shame on rich cap'talists like Webster 's Union to wring two cents from poor drunk chap , for lil ' word like ' soon ' , " he growled , and appealed to the operator . " Could n't you let me off that two cents ? " he asked winningly . " You 're good fellow -- good lookin ' fellow too "  - -  which was the truth . " Well , then , can I get ' em cheaper ' f I sen ' em by quantity ? I 'll do that -- how many for dollar , hey ? " " Five , " said the grinning operator , troubled by the irregularity , but taken by this highly entertaining scheme of telegraphing across the street . And Rex , his arts exhausted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five telegrams were sent to The Montana , a hundred feet away . The first being short two of the regulation ten words . Strong finished with a cabalistic phrase : " Rectangular parallelopipedon . " " That 'll get even Webster 's Union for chargin ' me two cents for ' soon ' , " he chuckled . " Do n't y ' wish y ' hadn ' charged me that two cents , hey ? " he demanded of the operator , laughing joyfully and cocking his hat over one ear , and the operator and two or three men who stood near could do no otherwise than laugh joyfully too . Strong straightened his face into a semblance of deep gravity . " Thish next one 's important , " he announced , and put the end of the pencil in his mouth and meditated , while his fascinated audience watched him . He was lost in thought for perhaps two minutes , and then scribbled madly , and as he ended the little bunch of men crowded frankly to look at what he had written . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewilderment with which it was read seemed to please him . " Dear Papa " : it ran . " I 'm Calymene Blumembachii , a trilobite , one of the crustaceans related to the emtomostracans , but looking more like a tetradecapod , but always your affectionate -- Billy . " He pushed it to the operator . " Split that in three , " he ordered . " Do n't want ruin the wires I 'm careful ' bout wires . Big fall snow would n't do more damage ' n heavy words like that , " he explained to the listening circle . " Think I look like tetradecapod ? " he asked of them as one who makes conversation . " Had that in geology lesson when I was fifteen , " he went on . " Got lodged in crack in brain and there tish t ' thish day ! Every now'n then I go ' flip , ' "  - -  he appeared to pull a light lever situated in his head --  " ' n fire it off . See ? Always hit something . " It was ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fairfax led his volcano from the hotel and headed for the apartment house . He expected another balk at the entrance , for his round of gaiety had come now to seem to him eternal -- he could hardly imagine a life in which he was not conducting a tipsy man through a maze of experiences . So that it was one of the surprises of the evening when Strong entered quietly and with perfect deportment took his place in the elevator and got out again , eight floors up , with the mildness of a dove . At the door of the apartment came the last brief but sharp action of the campaign . " Recky , " he said , taking Fairfax 's shoulders in his great grasp , " no mother could be t ' me what you 've been . " " I hope not , " Rex responded promptly , but Strong was not to be side-tracked . " No mother ' n the world -- not one -- no sir ! " he went on . His voice broke with feeling . " I 'll nev ' forget it -- nev '  - -  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Recky -- blessed old tomfool -- I 'm go'n kiss you good-night . " " You bet you 're not , " said Fairfax with emphasis . " Let go of me , you idiot , " and he tried to loosen the hands on his shoulders . But one of the most powerful men in New York had him in his grip , and Rex found himself suddenly folded in Billy 's arms , while a chaste salute was planted full on his mouth . As he emerged a second later , disgusted and furious , from this tender embrace , the clang of the elevator twenty feet away caught his ear and , turning , his eyes met the astonished gaze of two young girls and their scornful , frowning father . At that moment the door of the Strongs ' apartment opened , there was a vision of the elder Mr. Strong 's distracted face , the yellow gleam of the last telegram in his hands , and Rex fled . * * * * * Two weeks later , a May breeze rustling through the greenness of the quadrangle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a runaway child to its playmate , through an open window of the Theological Seminary building at Chelsea Square . Entering so , it flapped suddenly at the white curtains as if astonished . What was this ? Two muscular black clad arms were stretched across a table , and between them lay a brown head , inert , hopeless . It seemed strange that on such a May day , with such a May breeze , life could look dark to anything young , yet Reginald Fairfax , at the head of the graduating class , easily first in more than one way -- in scholarship , in athletics , in versatility , and , more than all , like George Washington , " first in the hearts of his countrymen , " the most popular man of the Seminary -- this successful and well beloved young person sat wretched and restless in his room and let the breeze blow over his prostrate head and his idle , nerveless hands . Since the night of the rescue of Billy Strong he had felt himself another and a worse man . He sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carty , " it read , " For mercy sake let me alone . I know I 've lost my chance at St. Eric 's and I know you 'll say it was my own fault . I do n't want to hear either statement , so do n't come near me till I hunt you up , which I will do when I 'm fit to talk to a white man . I 'm grateful , though you may not believe it . Yours -- Rex . " But the lost chance at St. Eric 's , although it was coming to weigh heavily on his buoyant spirit , was not the worst of his troubles . The girl from Orange -- there lay the sting . He had sent her a note as well , but there was little he was free to say without betraying Billy , the note was mostly vague expressions of regret , and Rex knew her clearheaded directness too well to hope that it would count for much . No answer had come , and , day by day , he had grown more dejected , hoping against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started and sprang to the door . One letter , but he could hardly believe his glad eyes when he saw the address on it , for it was the handwriting which he had come to know well , had known well , seeing it once -- her handwriting . In a moment the jagged-edged envelope , torn in a desperate hurry to get what it held , lay one side , and he was reading . " Dear Mr. Fairfax " : the letter ran ; " For two weeks I have been very unjust to you and I want to beg your pardon . Billy was here three days ago , and what I did n't know and what he did n't know we patched together , and the consequence is I want to apologize and to make up to you , if I can , for being so disagreeable . Billy 's recollections of that night were disjointed , but he remembered a lot in spots , and I know now just what a friend you were to him and how you saved him . I think he was horrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't half say it in writing so will you please come out for over Sunday -- mother says -- and I 'll try to show you how splendid I think you were . Will you ? Yours sincerely "  - -  and her name . Would he ? Such a radiant smile shone through the little bare room that the May breeze , catching its light at the window , clapped gay applause against the flapping curtain . This was as it should be . But the breeze and the postman were not to be the only messengers of happiness . Steps sounded down the long , empty hall , stopped at his door , and Rex , a new joy of living pulsing through him , sprang again , almost before the knock sounded , to meet gladly what might be coming . His face looked out of the wide-open doorway with so bright a welcome to the world , that the two men who stood across the threshold smiled an involuntary answer . " Carty ! I 'm awfully glad "  - -  and Rex stopped to put his hand out graciously , deferentially , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Judge Rush , this is my cousin , Mr. Fairfax , " Reed presented him , and in a moment Rex 's friend , the breeze , was helping hospitality on with gay little refreshing dashes at a warm , silvered head , as Judge Rush sat in the biggest chair at the big open window . He beamed upon the young man with interested , friendly eyes . " That 's all very well about the quadrangle , Mr. Reed . It certainly is beautiful and like the English Universities , " he broke into a sentence genially . " But I wish to talk to Mr. Fairfax . I 've come to bring you the first news , Mr. Fairfax , of what you will hear officially within a day or two -- that the vestry of St. Eric 's hope you will consider a call to be our assistant rector . " Rex 's heart almost stopped beating , and his smile faded as he stared breathless at this portly and beneficent Mercury . Mercury went on " A vestry meeting was held last night in which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other qualifications which have been mentioned to us by high authorities , were the reasons for this action which appeared upon the surface , but I want you to know the inner workings -- I asked your cousin to bring me here that I might have the pleasure of telling you . " It was rather warm , and the old gentleman had climbed stairs , and his conversation had been weighty and steady . He arrested its flow for a moment and took a long breath . " Do n't stop , " said Rex earnestly , and the others broke into sudden laughter . " I like that , " Judge Rush sputtered , chuckling . " You 're ready to let me kill myself , if needs be , to get the facts . All right , young man -- I like impetuosity -- it means energy . I 'll go on . The facts not known to the public , which I wish to tell you , are as follows . After your failure to keep your appointment on the evening of the 7th , I was about through with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , and we began to look for another assistant . A man who fitted the place as you did seemed hard to find and the case was in statu quo when , two nights ago , my son brought home young William Strong to dinner . Our families are old friends and Billy 's father and I were chums in college , so the boy is at home in our house . As you probably know , he has the gift of telling a good story , so when he began on the events of an evening which you will remember --  --  " Rex 's deep laughter broke into the dignified sentences at this point . " I see you remember . " Judge Rush smiled benignly . " Well , Mr. Fairfax , Billy made an amusing story of that evening . Only the family were at the table and he spared himself not at all . He had been in Orange the day before , and the young lady in the case had told him how you had protected him at your own expense -- he made that funny too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " Rex 's face flushed under this . " And as I thought the whole affair over afterwards , I not only understood why you had failed me , but I honored you for attempting no explanation , and I made up my mind that you were the man we wanted . Yes , sir , the man we want . A man who knows how to deal with the situations of to-day , with the vices of a great city , that is what we want . I consider tact , and broad-mindedness and self-sacrifice no small qualities for a minister of the gospel ; and a combination of those qualities , as in you , I consider exceptional . So I went to this vestry meeting primed , and I told them we had got to have you , sir -- and we 've got to . You 'll come ? " The question was much like an order , but Rex did not mind . " Indeed , I 'll come , Judge Rush , " he said , and his manner of saying it won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday morning when the new assistant preached his first sermon in St. Eric 's , there sat well back in the congregation a dark-eyed girl , and with her a tall and powerful young man , whose deep shoulders and movements , as of a well fitted machine , advertised an athlete in perfect form . The girl 's face was rapt as she followed , her soul in her eyes , the clean-cut , short sermon , and when the congregation filtered slowly down the aisles she said not a word . But as the two turned into the street she spoke at last . " He is a saint , is n't he , Billy ? " she asked , and drew a long breath of contentment . And from six-feet-two in mid-air came Billy Strong 's dictum . " Margery , " he said , impressively , " Rex may be a parson and all that , but , to my mind , that 's not against him ; to my mind that suits his style of handling the gloves . There was a chap in the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spit ' n ' image of Rex -- the good Samaritan chap , you know . He found a seedy one falling over himself by the wayside , and he called him a beast and set him up , and took him to a hotel or something and told the innkeeper to charge it to him , and -- I forget the exact words , but he saw him through , do n't you know ? And he did it all in a sporty sort of way and there was n't a word of whining or fussing at him because he was loaded -- that was awfully white of the chap . Rex did more than that for me and not a syllable has he peeped since . And , you know , the consequence of that masterly silence is that I 've gone on the water-wagon -- yes , sir -- for a year . And I 'm hanged if I 'm not going to church every Sunday . He may be a saint as you say , and I suppose there 's no doubt but he 's horrid intellectual -- every man must have his weaknesses . But the man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , he 's my sort , I 'm for him , " said Billy Strong . ***
