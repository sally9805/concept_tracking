IN Verona the gutters are of marble . The ledge you lean upon , the flight of steps going up outside a house , the posts which block a street against wheels , the fountain in the market-place , are all made of white or red marble . Pillars of white or red marble hold up the overhanging roofs of shops , and the shopkeepers paste their advertisements over the marble . Every street has its marble doorway , window , or balcony , shaped after a fine Renaissance pattern or carved with beautiful ornament . The Loggia , in that Piazza dei Signori which holds so much history in its stones , shows only , in its harmony of delicate proportions and faint colors , white and gold and pink , a subtler and more conscious use of the materials which lie ready to the hand everywhere in Verona . In an angle near the Ponte Navi , made by the Via Leoni and the Tomgadige Bartolomeo Rubele , is an old fragment of white marble , on which two old and sleepy lions , wounded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low pediment . To the right and left is a short marble pillar , with a square cross in a circle carved upon it . Over the tops of the houses , opposite the river , one sees the red and white tower , and the choir with its pointed gables set between slender cone-topped pillars , of the Gothic church of San Fermo Maggiore . In this huddle of white stone , which lies uncared for , in the road , before the doors of two shops , the forms are still alive , though sunk into the uneasy sleep of the wounded ; for the back of one of the lions is clean broken away , and the faces of both have gone dim , as if rubbed and washed out by rains and dust . Not far off , along the Via Leoni , is the Arch of the Lions , a beautiful fragment of a double Roman gateway , built into the wall of a house , with a shop-window fitted into the arch , and oil-lamps in the shop-window ; it standsthere , just turned aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its forms washed over and half obliterated , but still keeping the pathetic grace of a broken statue . And there are monsters everywhere , in red and white marble , crouching at the doors of churches and leaning over from the lintels , and carved in slabs let into the walls of houses . A very dreadful beast , with a face like a wheel , squats over the side doorway of the cathedral , clutched , I think , from behind by another beast whose home is in the stone ; and over the pillar on the other side of the doorway there is another fantastic wrestle . At the main doorway there are two monsters of red marble , which still look alive and hardly older after seven centuries ; their fur ribbed elegantly in conventional patterns along their smooth sides , and on one of them a strange design of a wheel , as if stamped into its flesh . They have not the solemn humor of the two red marble lions outside St. Mark 's at Venice , homely , companionable beasts , but arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tigers , and one of them lays its heavy claws upon two rams ' heads , which it crushes under it , while the other clutches the coils of a great snake which bites it with wide-open jaws . Columns of twisted and fluted red marble are set on their hacks , and columns of smooth white marble stand behind them ; and they help to hold up the under arch of the square doorway , with its alternate layers of smooth red marble and carved white marble . And the two colors of Veronese marble , red and white , are repeated in bricks , in pavements , in castles , churches , palaces , and bridges ; and at sunset the whole city seems to flush with ruddy light . After the lamps are lighted the colors are still visible . Square towers rise white and red above the houses , and everywhere there are tall archways which open upon lines of ruddy walls , or upon the gold blackness of a narrowing street . In the Piazza Erbe there is a marble fountain of the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been added to it , but its original design is the most simple and ample of any fountain I know . The basin is but slightly hollowed , and the water falling into it overflows upon a pavement that slopes outwards only just enough for the water to pour off it into a narrow rim around its edge , from which it is drained off on VOL . CV111 648 - 109 one side through an iron grating . The Tribuna , the other marble columns , the column with the lion of St. Mark , set there when Verona became tributary to Venice , stand about it in the Piazza ; and all over the ground white umbrellas rise like a wood of tall mushrooms , covering the stalls of fruit and vegetables , each umbrella set solidly into its wooden box , upon which it stands furled at night , like a great unlighted altar-candle . The Piazza Erbe is the most individual square that I know ; hardly two houses are of the same century , and each has its own personal quality . There is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of it ; but it is mean , discolored , the plaster blackened , the green shutters peeled and stained ; it is but two windows in breadth , and under almost every window there is a fragment of carved slime under the rusty iron balcony . The frescos in the Casa Mazzanti , Can Grande 's house , where Dante was a guest , are not yet , all gone from the walls ; poor people look out between them from every window , and look on a square hardly changed except for its tram-line . In the Via Mazzanti , at the back of the Piazza Erbe , the house of the Scalas is covered with balconies in long lines , with others set irregularly ; and a tall outer staircase goes up along the wall to the third story . A few fine windows are still left ; and below , clamped by long trails of iron hanging from the wails on each side of the narrow street , is a marble well , its eight sides covered with florid , effective carving , colored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , beside the Volto Barbaro , a passage which goes under fragments of old brickwork , looking out from the midst of modern building , there is an inscription , typical of many which may be seen in Verona : " Mastino I della Scala , eletto Podesta TA 1260 , Capitano del Popolo nel 1261 , eadde ueeiso a tradimento li 17 ( Mare 1277 , presso . questo volto da 66 ' detto Barbaro " ( Mastino I della Scala , elected Podesta in 1260 , Captain of the People in 1261 , fell , treacherously slain , the 17th October , 1277 , near this arch , thence called Barbarous ) . The Piazza was once the Forum , when Verona was Roman ; now it is the fruit-market , and the tram runs backwards and forwards through it all day long , down the street of the Lions , and past the house where they tell you Juliet lived . I was walking through it after dark , and I heard a thin tinkle of music coming out between half-closed shutters . Looking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? di Birra , " in his shirt-sleeves , whirled round in the arms of a customer who wore a hat and was smoking a Virginia . A moment later the landlady and a woman who had been sitting at one of the tables waltzed past the window . The guitar tinkled ; the dancers laughed , stopped , and went back to the tables at which they sat or waited . Among the many pictures at Verona I remember chiefly two Mantegnas . In San Zeno there is a throned Madonna and Saints , painted in 14:59 , and in this early picture one sees the suggestion of almost everything that is to become essentially the quality of Mantegna . It is fine , firm , and admirably designed , but with something in it a little hard and stiff . The figures , the architecture , the curious and elaborate scrollwork , are all characteristic ; and the formal part of a style is. there already . But there is not yet a complete mastery , soul as well as form ; the temperament , which is to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mantegna of the Palazzo Pompei the paint is cracked and rubbed , giving a roughened surface to the whole picture ; but it is wholly fine , and full of gracious and very personal severity . The face of the Madonna is taken from the same model as the famous Madonna in the Brera at Milan ; but what seems so much like mere prettiness in that charming composition has disappeared , and the beauty has deepened . In the same gallery there is a Cesare da Sesto , a Pietil , with the conventional rocks , the conventional arches ; but in the tiny picture there is a lovely jewellike quality which one does not always find in the work of that uncertain painter . There is a Franeia , too , a Holy Family , almost like a Perugino , which has a simpler quality of charm than any Francis I remember , with none of that forced and empty quality of pious emphasis which renders so large a part of his work uninteresting . And there is a Holy Family of Titian which is more purely a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is hardly remembered ; but it stands there , among so many admirable things , the work of the most wholly pictorial of all the painters . Tv When I try to call up Verona , it is always the cypresses of the Giardino Giusti , and the tall terraces which their tops almost reach , that come first to my mind . They are among the oldest cypresses in Europe , and among the tallest . I remember a bronze label on one incredibly wrinkled , dry , wizened , but still living bark , attesting it to have stood there four hundred years . The lean , ancient things stood as straight as pillars ; the whole slender stem seemed to sway with every breath of wind , as I looked down on them from the height from which one sees across Verona to the Apennines . A cypress never looks young , and these , when one saw only the sombre green fur of their foliage , looked no older than any cypress in any Turkish graveyard . To pass ? under them , and look close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time working by centuries upon the vegetable life of trees , to the work of time on the little animal lifetime of men . And then , as I think again of Verona , I see the church porch at the end of the street to which I came back every day , Sant ' Anastasia , with its ribbed brickwork and the marble arch of the doorway , and the fresco of the lunette . The bronze gates of San Zeno , each with its twenty-four reliefs , in the literal twelfth-century manner ; the plain arches of the Roman bridge and the winglike Ghibelline battlements of Can Grande 's bridge of the fourteenth century , with its inner galleries ; a glimpse of old tall houses going right down into the river , as one sees them in Canaletto 's pictures of Verona , done before the embankment straightened and spoiled it ; and then the lizard which I saw clinging to the wall of the hotel as I looked out of the window , and the inch-long snake which layasleep by the side of the pavement ? these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , come back before my eyes , and help to station Verona . And , as vividly as anything there , I sec the old water-seller who sat just aside from the Via Nuova , her copper-topped table of green wood with its pattern of brass nails , made to ft between the two short pillars of red marble with tops of white marble which stood at the entrance of the alley ; the bottles with brass stoppers which held some colored liquid , the large copper can which held the water , and the vast copper bowl with water for washing the glasses . V The Via Nuova is a narrow street which leads from the Piazza Erbe to the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele ; it is a street of shops , closed at ' both ends to traffic , like the Sierpes at Seville , and , like that , it is the evening promenade , or the be-ginning of a promenade which expands into that immense square which con-tains the Arena in one corner , leaving enough space over for the Muiiicipio , the old Guard House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace , caf ? s , shops , around no more than its outer edges . Beside the Arena , the oldest things in Verona are new , and look already passing into decay . When Dante walked in it , it was a ruin , and since that century it has suffered little except at the hands of the restorers . It was built for cruel use , not for beauty ; and there is a sternness in its as-pect which would suit ill with any not serious or deadly sport . But now , browned , defaced , the whole skeleton of its wails left naked , one ru-inous fragment ? of an outer wall still standing , unsupported and in all the disarray of age , it has that beauty of use , order , and strength which we have learned to see in the unadorned and very simple building of the Romans , almost wherever two stones are left on one another and not yet cast down . Seen at night , with a purple sunset facing it across the gate of the Viscontis , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white light , behind and above the great curve of its wall , it has another , romantic ! , almost Gothic , aspect , like that of those ruins of the Middle Ages which we begin to tire of , as being , like Swiss scenery , too picturesque , too splendidly ar-ranged for effect . But a quieting of the clouds brings it back to its austerity . In the evenings the band plays in the Piazza , and the chairs of the cafes spread right across the broad pavement , and the people walk slowly up and down , coming from the Via Nuova , passing by the Arena , and going nearly up to the old gateway . I sat there with great content , thinking of other city squares where I had sat watching the people from a chair set on the pavement outside a caft " ? , and I wondered whether even in the great square of St. Mark 's , where I should soon be , I should find more to remember , in what my eyes rested on , or a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
