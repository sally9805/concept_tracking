txt William J. Bryan , in a letter to the President , tonight , denounced Mr. Roosevelt 's political activity in behalf of William H. Taft . This document was given out in reply to the letter sent by the President to Mr. Bryan on Wednesday reviewing the attack on Gov . Haskell of Oklahoma , and also assailing Mr. Bryan 's record and " trust policy . In the letter Mr. Bryan said : " I do not regard it proper for the President to use his prestige , his mfluence , or his patronage , to aid one member of his party as against another who aspires to office , and I regard it as a violation of the obligation that the President owes to the whole people to use an office that ' belongs to the whole people as a party asset for the advancement of a personal friend and a political prot4g4 . " Leaves Haskell to the Courts . Mr. Bryan declined to enter further into the Haskell charges , declaring they would be taken to a proper tribunal for trial . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor so prominent in the Democratic campaign . He then replied to the President 's strictures on him , and in a series of questions asked Mr. Roosevelt to show greater opposition to lawless corporations than he had shown . He asked about the reported consent of the President to the absorption Of a rival by the Steel Trust . He referred to the Harriman contribution of 1004 . He wished to know if Gov . Hughes , whom the President had quoted , was one of the " reactionaries " ; if Gov . Hughes had been influenced in his views on trusts by contributions of Messrs . Morgan , Rockefeller , and others to his campaign fund , and if Gov . Hughes had been quoted because Mr. Taft 's views on trusts were not satisfactory . Mr. Bryan in conclusion said he dared to compare his works for the " moral uplift " of the Nation with Mr. Taft 's , his policies with those to which Mr. Taft was committed , and his ideal of the Presidency with Mr. Tart 's If the latter shared Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows : Mr. Bryan 's Letter . Milwaukee . Wis. , Sept. 26 , 1008 . Hon. Theodore Roosevelt , President of the United States , Washington , D. C. Dear Sir : While I have not yet received Your letter and shall not until I reach home next week , I have read a ' copy of it in the press and beg leave to submit the following reply : Mr. Haskell having voluntarily resigned from the committee that he might be more free to prosecute those who have brought charges against him , I need not discuss the question of his guilt or innocence further than to say that the public service which he has rendered and the vote of confidence which he has received from the people of his State , ought to protect him from condemnation until the charges can be examined in some court where partisanship does not bias , and where campaign exigencies do not compel prejudgment . I would not deem it necessary to address you further , but for the fact you seize upon the charges and attempt to make political capital out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Haskell 's selection as a member of the Resolutions Committee and as Treasurer of 4the committee raises a question as to my sincerity as an opponent of trusts and monopolies . As an individual , and as the candidate of my party , I resent the charge and I repel the insinuation . I have been in public life for eighteen years , and I have been sufficiently conspicuous to make my conduct a matter of public interest . I have passed through two Presidential campaigns in which party feeling ran high . and epithet was exhausted . I have no hesitation in saying that you can not find an act , a word , or a thought of mine to justify your partisan charge . Not Informed of Charges . I had never been informed of anr , charge that had been made against Mr. ' Haskell connecting him with the Stand ; and Oil Company or with any other trust . I had known him as a leader in the Constitutional Convention of Oklahoma , and had known him as one of the men principally responsible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a majority of over 1000 .. 000 , 70,000 of which was furnished by Republicans . I had known of his *leetion. to the Governorship of that via young State by a majority of some ** I had known that the Constitution . VOI . adopted and that Gov . Haskell was iiietr : ed in spite of the efforts of your Administration and in spite of the speeches OtOjetS in Oklahoma by Mr. Taft . You say that it was a matter of ligiotc .. : mon notoriety that Mr. Haskell netted with the Standard Oil Comokig I have a right to assume that if rious an objection had existed to , Hasiell'a election and had been a a common rtptoriety in Ohio , as y Judge Taft would have felt It his : Wiens duty to warn the , people 9/52fikatiii u ts . 4410 the knowledgeae why can it be assumed that I - had , , it ? And if he had it , how can you eAuse his failure  --  to communicate the information to the people of Oklahoma ? If ' y'ou feel it your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the National organization , how much more would Mr. Taft have felt It his patriotic duty to denounce Mr. Haskell when he was aspiring to be ' the chief executive of a great State ? Refers to Federal License . I could have had no konwledge of the suit to which you refer when be was appointed Chairman of the Resolations Committee of the Democratic , National Con- ' tendon , because the suit was begun while he was at Denver , and , as a matter of fact , I did not know anything of the nature of the suit until after he was made , Treasurer of the National Committee , and so fair-minded person can decide upon the merits of your charge without an examination of the provisions of the enabling act Passed by a Republican Congress , and the provisions of the license on franchise issued to the oil company by your Administration . I need hardly refer to the newly found evidence upon which you lay so much stress , viz. : The article in The Outlook of Sept. 5 . My attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published copy of your letter , and , while I have great respect for The Outlook , end . I suppose I have for the writer , ( although you do rot give his name , ) I would hardly feel justified in deciding as promptly as you do on an ex parte statement without Investigation . You present an indictment against our platform declarations on the trust question , but you do not refer to all of the planks , and do not deal justly with those to which you do refer . Our platform declares in favor of the " vigorous enforcement of the criminal law against guilty trust magnates and officials . " Your platform does not contain any such demand . Will you say that your platform is better than ours in that respect ? Our platform demands that corporations beyond a certain size be compelled to sell at the samg price in all parts of the country , due allowance being made for the eost of transportation . Will you deny that this is in the interest of the consumer and In the interest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation will be permitted to control more than one-half of the total product . It has been stated that the steel company , with k-our express consent , purchased one of Its largest rivals and thus obtained control of more than 50 per cent , of the total Output . Will you insist that In permitting this you showed less favor to the monopolistic corporations than I do in opposing It ? Hughes a Reactionary ? He Asks . You quote at length from a speech made by Gov . Hughes in which he ridicules one of our anti-trust remedies . Is this the tame Gov . Hughes who was counted as one of the " allies " who endeavored to defeat Mr. Taft when , as you Insisted , Mr. Taft represented " reformers " of your party and his opponents the reactionary element ? Did not Gov . Hughes have the support of the New York delegation in the convention , and is not New York City the home of many of the Republicans most conspicuous in their conhection with the law-defying corporations ? , You are certainly aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Sheldon , the'rreasurer of the Republican State Committee , two years ago , after Mr. Hughes 's election , it appears that the following contributions were made to the campaign fund : J. P. Morgan . $20,000 ; John D. Rockefeller , $5,000 : Andrew Carhegle , 95,000 : Charles M. Schwab , $2,000 ; John W. Gates , $2.000 ; W. E. Corey , F2,000 : W. Nelson Cromwell , $1,000 ; W. F. HaVemeyer , aS00 ; B , Duke , 4500 . Several of these men are known to be offi:tally connected with the trusts . Would the fact that these gentlemen rontributed to his campaign fund Strengthen or weaken his testimony against the reasonableness of our antitrust remedy ? . Hughes Critic . Not Statesman . You can not have failed to notice that Gov . Hughes In his speech assumed the role of the critic , and not that of the constructive statesman . Any one possessing a vivid imagination and a pen can find Objections to remedial measures . Lord Macaulay is quoted as saying that eloeuent and learned men could be found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be gained by it . Put when " known abuses are to be cured , an ounce of remedy is worth a pound of faultfinding . As you quote from Gov . Hughes , I take It for granted that Mr. Taft has not yet expressed himself in as satisfactory manner on the subject , for you would naturally prefer to quote from the Presidential candidate wherever po.ssible , You say " Let me repeat that no lawdefying corporation has any other reason to fearefrom you save what it will suffer In the general paralysis of business , " &e.; Referring to the last part of the sentence first , I might question your ability to act es an expert as to panic preventives , since you now have one on your hands , but as to your charge that no law-defying corporation has reason to rear the direct effect of the anti-trust remedies which I favor , permit me to suggest that your testimony on fills subject is not conclusive . You are a witnees , to he sure , but ; ? our interest in the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony . Willing to Defy Trust Reads . There Is better evidence . r trust magnates know their own interests and they are supporting Judge Taft . Not one of- the trust magnates helped to secure my nomination , while it is a matter Of " ' Common ' Common notoriety " that they were con spicuous in the Republican Convention , and Jt is equally a matter of common notoriety that they are supporting your party in this campaign . If you will name a single official connected with " a lawdefying corporation , " monopoly , or trust , who has declared or will declare that he is supporting me , I will publicly warnhim that I will enforce , against him the present criminal law and will enforce ' against him also the laws demanded in the Democratic platform as soon as these ' laws can be enacted . But there is another fact which raises a presumption in favor of our party and against your party . I referred to it in my former letter to you , but you inadvertently overlooked it in your reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultation , evidently did not notice it . I stated that we had not knowingly received a dollar from any official connected with a corporation known as a trust , and that any money so received would be returned as soon as we received knowledge of the fact . I now remind you that your convention deliberately rejected , by a vote of 9 to 1 , the plank favoring publicity as to campaign contributions . Mr. Taft hap. repudiated the action of the convention and rebuked the members of the convention by declaring himself in favor of a publicity law , but he favors publicity after election , while we favor publicity before election . Which do you regard as the better plan  --  to-let the people know before the election What influences are at work , or to let them know after the elec .. tion ? The Harriman Contribution . Are you willing to say that any public Interest was served in 1904 by concealing until after the election the contributions made to the Republican Campaign Committee by Mr. Harriman , and those collected by him for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election of the contributions then made would have had no effect on the elec-tion ? , As I have said , we shall publish the names of contributors above one hundred dollars . Will you ask your National Committee to publish before the election the contributions above one hundred dollars ? Or , if you regard this as too small a sum , the contributions above a thousand dollars , or , If this is also too small , the contributions above ten thousand dollars ? If not , what reason can you give to the public for not doing so ? I lnsist that our willingness to let the public know the sources from which we receive contributions raises a presumption in our favor that must be overcome before eyou can ask the people to accept your statement that the law-defying corporations have more to fear from Republican success than from a Democratic victory . In conclusion you say that you ask support for Mr. Taft " because he stands for the moral uplift of the Nation , because his deeds have made good his words , and because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike to the honor and the interests of the whole American people . " I dare to comrvre my efforts for the moral uplift of the Nation with his efforts , my deeds with his deeds , and the policies to which I am committed with the policies to which he is committed , and , more than that , if I may assure ethat he will follow in your footsteps , I dare to compare my ideal of the Presidency with his . Attacks Roosevelt Campaign . I do not regard it as proper ' for the President to use his prestige , his influence , or his patronage to aid one member of his party as against another who aspires to office , and I regard it as a violation of the obligation that the President owes to the whole people to use an office that belongs to the whole people as a party asset for the advancement of al personal friend and a political protege . Believing that the President should not be tempted to use that power for his own advantage  --  and it is equally repugnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for any one else 's advantage  --  I tried to secure an amendment to the Constitution limiting the President to a single term , and I have announced in three campaigns that if elected I would not be a candidate for renomination . I believe that the occupant of so high an office , with such enormous power at his command , should be absolutely free to devote himself unselfishly to his country 's welfare , and I am sanguine enough to believe that if intrusted with power I would be able to make my administration so successful that the members of my party could . without interference from me , select the one most worthy to carry on the work begun by me  --  so successful that the administration would speak for itself , and that it would not be necessary for me to defend it in bulletins or pronunclamentos . I think I could in this way give to the members of the opposite party as well as to the members of my own party a " square deal . " Very truly yours , W. BRYAN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
