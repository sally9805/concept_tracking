 |p1288  MY grandfathers came out of the East with the sturdy pioneers who drove out the Canaanites and possessed the land . One was nineteen and the other twenty-one at the time of their coming , and each settled down in the center of his clearing , built a rude shack and married . Those seem to have been the three perfectly inevitable steps in those days . There were no bachelors ; marriage followed the erection of a cabin as surely as the razor follows " long pants . " In my father 's case the incident of a college education intervened to raise the marriage age to twenty-three . I am enough older than that to have been out of college several years and marriage stands out on my horizon , small and indistinct -- a far off divine event toward which my progress is measured in inches . I make the proposition thus unpleasantly personal simply because I am in possession of all the facts in my own case , and because it seems to be typical rather than otherwise . The young fellows of my acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fathers were . They are not less courageous or willing to sacrifice for the sake of those they cherish . Yet for some reason or other they are not getting married . I notice it here in this big dormitory which we call a suburb , to which we come out at night to sleep . I notice it more particularly even at alumni dinners in the city . The unmarried men there are alarmingly numerous . Frequently they are among the brightest and handsomest men at the tables ; almost always the best drest . My observation has progressed to the point where it begins to make me doubt whether the good old custom of matrimony , which has hung on so well , is not now finally falling into disuse . There are a dozen or so of us who graduated together from the high school and have hung together pretty well since . tho separated for a while in different colleges . One is a lawyer , just admitted to the bar and living on the hope of future fees , two more are engineers , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there are three more who are simply " in business , " and a doctor recently made . The interesting thing about it is that not one of us is married . tho five years ago every one would have said he would be . In fact , the whole subject of matrimony has come to be rather a tabooed one among us ? something in which the interest has very largely died out . Occasionally some one mentions the name of a particular girl and she is discussed in that unemotional , impersonal way in which we talk over the merits of an automobile . Something which we all admire but never expect to possess . It is for all the world as tho Moses and a few of his chums were sitting on the mountain and looking over into the promised land , knowing that they would never arrive . The doctor is typical of the rest of us . His parents married in the year of their graduation from a lonesome little co-ed/ ucational college and settled down on a salary of $800 a year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they still maintain that they were richer in those eight hundred dollar days than they have ever been since . The son 's income is probably $1000 , possibly $1200 now , but he is strong in his conviction that the thing can not be done at that price . And I rather think he is right . Here is the problem then ; what is the answer ? Whose is the hand that is pushing the marriage age higher and higher every year , giving us bald-headed young fathers and childless or one-child families ? To my mind it can be none other than the late Mr. Dingley . Ever since I was selected to defend free trade in a tariff debate in college and came out a free trader tho I had been a protectionist before , I have made it a study to reduce as many as possible of our national evils to a high tariff cause . And it is interesting to see how many of them reduce . The only wonder in my mind is that so many near-statesmen continue to bow down before their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one hand while writing an article in favor of protection with the other , and fails to see that it is because our tariff has forced us into an unnatural condition of industrial development that we have squandered our portion like the prodigal son . The panic was possible because our prosperity instead of being of the sturdy common or garden variety has grown up a tender tropical plant which the slightest breath of suspicion can shrivel . And it is the tariff no less before which marriage has fallen . The college-bred man as I know him graduates with the idea of marrying so young that his wife may sacrifice with him in the growth of his success , and may grow up with him into its fullness . And when he gets out and is settled at work . he finds he ca n't do it . He is making a whole lot more perhaps than his father ever did at his age , but the price of living is something that his father at his age never dreamed of . And so year by year he puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , leaving the white spot showing underneath , and he has got beyond the time . Occasionally one gets married , I know . I 've been to their weddings and given them presents . But do they fall in love ? I do n't think so . Not as the lovers we read of in books do , at any rate . In them there bursts on the young man suddenly the glorious vision of the only woman who can ever make him happy . She may be a prince 's daughter and he only a struggling clerk , but it makes no difference . He leaves all and pitching in , wins her regardless of every other consideration . Those of my acquaintances who have married have not ( lone so . Rather they have set for themselves a certain income mark at which they believed that the thing could be done . And having reached that mark each of them has calmly and deliberately gone forth and selected a wife . To nearly every one of them she has come too late in aiding him to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather a luxury which his hard work has at last enabled him to afford . Doubtless they are often very happy and useful to each other . But it is n't the sort of thing a man could dream much about . So I am looking for the statesman to arise who will make his campaign squarely on the issue of tariff revision in the interests of matrimony . It will have to be a different kind of revision than the tariff has undergone recently at the hands of its loving friends . It will have to be radical and it will have to come soon . That is , if it is to be of any help to me.
