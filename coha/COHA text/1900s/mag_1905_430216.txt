 |p1219  WHEN one goes cruising on his own yacht his joys are varied as he can pass from point to point , running in at this bay or that river , visiting this , that or the other city , and stepping ashore to get the feel of the land again . But still there is a great deal of monotony in yachting . Practically the scenery is always the same . Far as the sight stretches to-day is the sea that rolled about one yesterday , with the line of the horizon as its only boundary . Matters of interest are few and one learns nothing new about the world and its people . Not so with land cruising in an automobile , or touring , as it is called . The scenes are constantly changing as the car flies along . Now the country is hilly , now gently rolling , and again , flat , with all the fields of growing things , backed by the woods , spread out in panorama . One gets very close to nature , and to him  |p1220  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the bird to swoop and soar and observe , with the mind of the man to speculate and understand . Towns , villages , cities appear and disappear , all busy with their little affairs , each thinking that its own personal hum is the voice of the world . The land cruiser sees a deal of human nature . Close to the cities , where automobiles are common , some of the manifestations are apt to be unpleasant as the honest rustics of the constabulary and the local bench , being ingenious and thrifty , sometimes seek to turn touring into a commodity for their marketing . Thus they station men at intervals with stop watches , hiding them behind trees . The automobilist is forced to stop on account of a furniture van pulled across a narrow road , or some such obstruction , and he finds himself in the hands of-well , call them tax-gatherers . There are the constable and assistant constable and some deputy constables , all honorable men and horny handed sons of toil , with their testimony carefully rehearsed ; and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerable justice of the peace , dispenser of the laws , who holds his court beneath the spreading greenwood tree and fines the automobilist enough to make the day 's work profitable for all hands except the man who pays . Bodin 's Car , P It is a scene of sweet arcadian beauty and the glimpses of human nature displayed by the ruralists in pursuit of the dollars go far to compensate a tourist whose temperament is properly philosophic . From ten to twenty-five dollars is the usual price of admission , for , as the venerable gentleman who presides on the imaginary bench declares : " By gum , these here city fellers he s got ter unnerstan ' it with a thet they ca n't do no skyhootin ' thro ' our taown . No , sir ! " But such adventures as these are only met with on the outskirts of the big cities , in shoal water , as one might say . When one cruises out into the blue water of the real ocean of country he finds no such set traps , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , two sides to the question of automobilists ' fines . Automobilists in the past have broken laws , done damage and cost lives by their recklessness ; but at the present time I believe they are more often sinned against than sinning . The ruralists imagine that the man who has an automobile must naturally be rich enough to stand a squeeze , so they gather him in as a part of the season 's crop . It is not only the constables and the justices who in some instances seek to flourish at the expense of the folks who travel in the new fangled machines . Mine jovial host of the wayside inn is of the same mind and is apt to bite hard  |p1221  if given the opportunity . A horse , which eats oats and hay , can secure board and lodging for the night for 50 cents , while the automobile , which carries its own provision , must pay $1 . The charges for towing an automobile are also very high . However , all this is only in the neighborhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced every year , as the newness wears off the machines and people come to recognize them as ordinary vehicles entitled to ordinary treatment . Out in the blue waters of the country ocean , where automobiles are rare , the inns hail them as benefactors , as their drawing power is equal to a small circus . The inhabitants come in crowds , and the stimulation of their cerebral activities caused by examination of the machine and consideration of its qualities develops thirst which the alert landlord coins into good , hard money . One can always tell when he is in a new district by the actions of the horses . If he sees a horse standing on his hind legs , biting the atmosphere and making wigwag signals with his forefeet , he can be sure that that horse is not sophisticated . There 's only one thing to do if the tourist has a companion , he must stop the car , jump out and seize the horse by the head . If he waits for the farmer to wake up the horse will climb a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted with automobiles think them uncanny , and , under the influence of superstition , will do desperate things . If formally introduced to a quiet machine and allowed to smell and examine it at their leisure horses soon grow tolerant and finally blase , tho I do n't know why the smell of gasoline should be reassuring . One very good touring route is from New York along the Boston Post Road , which runs for a long distance beside the Sound , and then through New Haven to Springfield and Boston . From there you can go to Marblehead , Portsmouth , etc. , and on through Crawford Notch to the White Mountains . The scenery is varied and glorious , the roads are of the best , while the wayside inns are good and comfortable . This is the route of the tour of the American Automobile Association for the Glidden Touring Trophy . Contestants will probably start about July 11th , visiting Mount Washington Hotel and being present at the Mount Washington hill climbing events , which will be held this year about the same days as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the eight-mile climb up the average grade of 18 per cent . in less than twenty-six minutes . This White Mountain district is most picturesque and offers excellent chances  |p1222  for adventure . Some of the hills are steep , but not dangerous . There are difficulties enough , however , to lend spice to the trip . In returning from this locality one may come through Franconian Notch and down the charming Connecticut Valley , or through Concord , Nashua and Worcester , Mass. , back to the line of the Boston Post Road again . Following west through Springfield to Pittsfield , Mass. , one arrives on the most beautiful point of the Berkshire Hills , a region of fine landscapes , well appointed houses and very good roads . A short run can be taken through Lenox , Stockbridge and Great Barrington down to Poughkeepsie , after which one can follow the lovely Hudson River Valley back to New York . This is one of the best tours for a good time , fine accommodation and pure enjoyment . If one desires something more ambitious or wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York by the New York Central route , through Albany , Utica , Syracuse , along the lake shore even as far as Cleveland , Toledo or Chicago . Another very alluring route passes through the Catskill Mountains , proceeding directly west from Kingston by the Grand Hotel to Binghamton , and from there going through a fine agricultural country in the western part of New York State , and joining as a finality the northern or the New York Central road at Batavia . Long Island , of course , as every one knows , is the best locality for a few days ' touring . One can skim the south shore going and the north shore coming back , with beautiful scenery , good roads and satisfactory hotels everywhere . New Jersey also has many attractions to offer . Tourists from New York go out to New Brunswick and there take the famous Rumsen road to the shore and along to Point Pleasant , Lakewood and even as far as Atlantic City . Manv tourists reach this locality by coming from Philadelphia over White Horse Pike .  |p1223  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which leads west through Hagerstown and Cumberland to Wheeling on the Ohio River , is also very attractive as well as historic . Over this road , first built by the British and the Colonists , flowed the great stream of settlers 16o years ago . English , Irish , Scotch and Americans with their families crossed the Allegheny Mountains by means of this highway and pre-empted the lands beyond , into which the French were then moving . Relics of those old days are common along the route . The old inns still stand there with their immense chimneys and fireplaces , almost big enough to take a cord of wood at a time . Old milestones and sundials speak eloquently of the past . Going west from Wheeling one crosses the foothills and emerges on the plains , where the farming country is unsurpassed . The road here was built through the States of Ohio and Indiana by money obtained from the sale of public lands as provided for when they received their charters as States , 5 per cent . being set aside for this purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicyclists , but less explored by the automobilist . In the early spring or late fall the blossoms on the trees or the turning leaves make scenes of rare beauty all the way from Winchester and Lexington as far as Natural Bridge . Like all the Southern roads , one here finds this was constructed after the old method ? the builders laid the stones and waited for travel to beat them in and make the bed smooth . Some of these roads have very solid foundations , they have at intervals what are called " water breakers " or " bars , " known in the North as " thank-you-ma'ams , " which are very annoying and liable to break your springs if taken too fast . If one can overcome the difficulties of the Southern highways he can find many attractive places in the South . Ormond Beach , Florida , is a bit of paradise for  |p1224  the autoist . During last winter the fastest mile ever made by a vehicle going under its own power was made there by H. W. Bowden , of Boston , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercedes motors . He went the mile in 32 2-5 seconds , but was not allowed a record as his machine was overweight . Florida likewise offers attractions for the winter tourist and he will do well also to cross to Cuba with his machine . In Cuba he will find glorious roads , hard white and smooth running through avenues of palms . France itself would be hard put to it to surpass the excellence of some Cuban roads , which are a legacy from the departed Spaniards . As to the question of what machine is best for the tourist the answer to that must be that it depends on the tourist . Different tourists have different wants . For luxury and speed it is almost everywhere admitted that the foreign built machines are the best at the present time , as well as the highest priced . Among American machines are models well adapted for touring , and perhaps that give the buyer more for his money than he gets elsewhere . As far as reliability goes there are American machines that I think will stand all tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road the White steam car , for instance , ranks very high . Electric cars are more suited to the city and immediate suburbs . Some high powered gasoline cars are well calculated for touring , and are comfortable with four or five in the party , but I strongly advise against overloading any car and warn the tourist to be quite sure that he has a place for everything and all the articles he requires , otherwise there will be great discomfort . The pleasure of a party is much enhanced if they can dispense with a chaffeur . It is well to provide warm and waterproof clothing and chains for the wheels , to prevent skidding . Extra tires must be carried , of course , and two jacks are better than one , because when you have the machine raised on one jack you can slip the other under and raise it still more . The bravest tourists can dispense with canopied tops , altho if the road 's smooth and ladies are in the party they are of great convenience . Another thing needed is a camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he should also have as a chart a route-card , showing the towns through which he will go , their distance from each other and from the starting point . He should if possible also report the tour to some organization or periodical . The Touring Committee of the American Automobile Association have a great deal of information to impart to the tourists . They contemplate issuing maps for the benefit of their members and friends , and are glad to assist them . Motorists will find that by consulting the committee they will be able to make the tour without much difficulty . Accidents will happen , of course , but they need not be a source of displeasure . A person can have a great deal of enjoyment repairing a machine , provided it is well made and he successfully overcomes the difficulty . There is much pleasure in getting it just right . An accident should not be dreaded , but accepted as part of the tour . There is a deeper pleasure , a more lasting sense of gratification , at accomplishing some difficult undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is all over one is glad to look back and to go over again the experience and feel that part of life had been lost if the event had been omitted . The motorist should remember always to slow up when coming to a crossroad . No one can tell what 's around the corner . The greatest danger is from other cars , which at times certainly do come whizzing by . Some idea of the way in which the sport of automobiling is progressing in this country may be gained from the figures of the manufacturers . There are now about 17,000 licenses issued in New York State alone , and something like 75,000 have been made in this country . Last year 25,000 machines were made and this year 30,000 are being made . I will make one last suggestion : When out in the country always check information received by questioning the next man you meet . Ask him as to the road you are on and how far it is to the town you are making for ; distances are especially deceptive . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question and checking
