txt City Superintendent Maxwer .. 7. is to be warmly . congratulated for the sound and temperate discussion in his annual report . of the women teachers ' salary agitation of . " equal pay for equal work . " He admits the principle that the position should carrythe salary , and shows that , in . the great majority of cases  --  those of the women teachers ? it is already in vogue . The exceptions are the comparatively few men teachers , for whom " not because on the average they teach the ordinary school branches.better than . women de , ' but for special purposes " specified at length  --  the position carries the average salary , ' and more . Dr. Maxwint , finds that at two points , the top and the bottom of the school system , salaries are inadequate , being either unsuited to the station of Incumbents or ? not such as to attract to the schools of New York the best teaching talent in the country . 1 Bearing in mind the city 's embarrassed ' finances , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women teachers in the elementary schools be increased from $600 to $720 , and that a maximum salary maturing after a . given period be made uniform for all women class teachers . As it- Is quite as difficult to obtain women Prin. cipale as men Principals , their salaries should he equalized , and as men and women on the eligible lists for the high schools are declining appointments , preferring smaller Salaries in cities , where the living expenses are considerably less , better inducements should be made for this class of teachers , The " special purposes " for which a few men are deemed necessary to SUPplement the - work Of the . majority women teachers arise , according to Dr , MAxwmt ? from the differing - psychological-  and social influences- of men and women in developing character .. Assuming that the development of ? character , not classreom Studies , is the prima object of education , he paints to the fact that the large proportion Of children in our schools come - from uncultured homes , in which the father IS the breadwinner and nothing else . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only women as teachers , " the impression Made upon their minds is sure to - be that culture and refinement are for women alone and not ' ' at all for men . " Citing HERBERT SrEmosn 's doctrine as to the differing intellectual and emotional characteristics of men and women , he justifies the retention of a few able men at salaries that will attract them , as follows : If Mr. SPENCER 'S conclusions are Just : if women respond more readily to appeals to pity and men to appeals to equity ; it women are guided more by generosity and men by justice ; it women 's minds dwell more on what is concrete and proximate , and men 's on what is abstract and remote ; if women see more clearly the simple , - direct conseqUences of an act , while men are prone to consider the complex and indirect consequences ; if women realIse public good-that is Immediate and men more clearly realize public ) ends that are remote ; if women stand- more in ' awe of ' , power and authority while men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men respect freedom , it follows that children , girls ' as well as boys , should , In their school . work , come under the influence of the mind of the man as well as of the mind of the woman . . 1 , Throughbut his discussion Dr. MAN'mad. not slight the conflicting claims of the men and women teachers , but seeks rather to reconcile them to the needs of their charges In the public schools .
