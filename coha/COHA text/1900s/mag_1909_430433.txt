 |p493  THE actor , whom I shall call Montgomery Stone because that is n't his name , could scarcely speak above a whisper . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " I lost my voice yesterday , having my picture taken , " he answered painfully . Then he grinned at my evident perplexity , and explained , " I was subduing a mob for a moving-picture film . The best moving-picture actors always talk , you know , while the picture is being taken . It works you up into the proper mood for gestures and facial expression , and makes your mouth go naturally . " " But you ? moving pictures ? I do n't get it , " said I , trying to be diplomatic . He laughed , or rather croaked . " Yell , the show I was in has closed , " he said huskily , " and I 've nothing till fall , so I 'm filling in posing for the picture people . I get good pay every time I pose . It 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good professionals who do pose nowadays . Besides , I always play the leads . " A few days later , when Montgomery Stone had recovered his voice sufficiently to have his picture taken once more , he invited me to attend that interesting function . The " studio " was a large steel and concrete building on the outskirts of New York City , with a glass roof and sides that were half glass , too . On a sunny day pictures could be taken by natural light . The floor was divided into trapped sections like the stage of a modern theater , and there was room for two or three sets at a time . There were dressing rooms , property rooms , scenepainting lofts , and carpenter shops . One of the stage sets now represented the cabin of a ship . And presently Mr. Stone emerged from a dressing-room clad and whiskered like a fussy little old man , and took his place in this cabin . One section of a film portraying Mr. Barker 's adventures in Europe ( an idea evidently borrowed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip over . The ship was going to roll , and Mr. Barker was going to be very miserable . Just how the ship was going to roll , I could n't see . But the moving-picture makers do n't let a little thing like a steel and concrete building bother them . " Now , Mr. Stone , you are supposed to look sick , " said the stage manager . " And try to appear unsteady . Remember the ship 's rolling something fierce . Spread your legs apart more . Hang onto chairs and things . And when Otto the man at the camera says door , ' lunge toward the door ; when he says bunk , ' lunge toward that . When I say sand , ' jump away from the port hole . " I still failed to see how the effect was going to be gained , in spite of Montgomery Stone 's inane staggering about on the perfectly stable floor and his agonized facial expression . After a few rehearsals and much shouting the stage manager cried , " Ready with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenery with a pail of sand and crouched beneath the port hole . Somebody else took hold of a string that was tied to the leg of a chair . The man at the camera examined the mechanism on which it stood to see that everything was working smoothly . Mr. Stone adjusted his whiskers firmly , assumed anew his expression of extreme nausea , took a firm brace with his feet on the level floor , and the signal came to begin . Then I saw how the trick was done . The man at the camera , as he turned the crank which winds the film across the shutter , rocked the camera from side to side . Every moment he would give it a violent lurch to the left , yelling " Bunk ! " and the actor would stagger toward the bed . Then would follow a lurch to the right , the cry of " Door ! " and the actor would reel dizzily across the perfectly level floor to the door . Between times the stage manager would yell " Sand ! " and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the actor leaped out of the way . At one lurch the man with the string yanked the chair over , and thereafter he twitched it about the floor from time to time . " One hundred feet , " said the man at the @# camera . " One hundred and fifty ? one hundred and seventy-five --  " " Now , ready , lurch , bunk , fall in head first ! " cried the stage manager . And t h e camera stopped at the two hundred feet of film , with the actor lying in a huddled heap in his bunk . And when that section of " The Adventures of Mr. Barker " was projected a few weeks later on the screens of many of the 7000 moving picture theaters in America , it gave the complete illusion of being taken on board a liner , in a heavy sea . Only once or twice , the careful observer might have noticed , the suffering old gentleman staggered the wrong way to preserve his center of gravity . Montgomery Stone , as he truly says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them , like the sea trip of Mr. Barker , were comedies . Once he played the part of a boy who tied a rope to his foot and then hung the end of the rope out of the window , that his chum might come along and wake him . Of course , the wrong person got hold of the rope , and our hero was yanked bodily out of bed and through the window . This effect was no more difficult to secure than Peter Pan 's flights in the play . The actor lay on a little hidden board , suspended by piano wires , and at the proper moment he sailed rapidly out of bed and vanished through the window , apparently yanked by the rope tied to his foot . But Mr. Stone 's abilities are not confined to comedy . Indeed , with the considerable elevation of public taste in the past two years and the still greater desire to do better things on the part of the picture manufacturers , the " trick " film , and the merely farcial , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is easy enough to stop the camera , substitute a dummy for a live actor , and then show the character in the picture falling down a precipice or being knocked twenty feet by an automobile ; or it is easy to put in a section of'the film backward , thus showing a man who has jumped from a bridge , turned in mid air , and jumped back again ; or it is easy to hang the camera from the ceiling and , by photographing the actor crawling.on his stomach over a canvas painted like a wall and spread out on the floor . get the effect ,  |p495  when the picture is projected on the upright screen , of a man scaling an impassible barrier as if by magic . Almost anything can be accomplished , indeed , through the control exercised over the camera by the operator , who winds the film across the shutter by hand , and can accelerate it , space or stop it altogether , at will . For instance , an actor dives into a pond , the camera is stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is started again and takes a picture of the blank water for five minutes , then is stopped once more and the actor dives a second time . As he comes up the camera is once more started , and the effect , of course , of the finished picture is of a man who dives and remains under water an incredible time . He may even seem to emerge at a point an incredible distance from the spot where he went under , for while the camera is taking the picture of blank water it can easily be moved along the shore , or in a boat , and when the actor dives the second time it can be in a place a long way.from the scene of the first plunge . But odd as such pictures always are the public has learned more or less to see through the tricks , even a little to tire of them . At best they are the " comic relief " of canned drama . The audiences have come to demand real drama , pictures that tell a coherent , interesting story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors taking the parts . Hence Montgomery Stone is often called on to pose out of doors , and to be on occasion quite intensely dramatic . Indeed , at the present time , in the suburbs of New York , Brooklyn , Philadelphia or Chicago , any pleasant day you are likely to chance on a big automobile loaded with actors and actresses in full paint and strange array , or to find upon a suburban street corner , or down a country lane , extraordinary actions going on in front of a purring camera . Not long ago an automobile elopement was being taken in Brooklyn . The eloping couple in one car were being pursued by the camera in another . Down the road , dressed as policemen , two actors waited to spoil the elopement by making an arrest for speeding . Fcr all that I know , they are still waiting , for two real policemen stopped the car before it reached the actors , and carried the genuinely protesting couple off to a real station house . The man with the camera shrewdly said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , the real police station was not equipped with the proper lighting apparatus to continue the film , but up to the time when the party reached the door , that film is one of the most realistic ever taken . Another case of real police interference in New York did n't turn out so well . The picture was of " A Black Hand Escape , " and the leading actor , made up as a very terrible Italian , was supposed to get away . A real policeman intercepted him in full flight , at the point of his revolver , and , such is the state of feeling toward the Black Hand in the New York Police force , it was ten minutes before the patrolman could be made to understand that this was all a play . The film , of course , was ruined . Once , in the Bronx ( an outlying section of New York City ) a whole party of actors and actresses were arrested for disturbing the peace , and carried to the station house in a body . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the picture men themselves do all in their power to avoid attracting a crowd . Aside from the somewhat flippant remarks hurled at the actors by the street spectators , there is always the danger of somebody who does n't belong there getting into the field of the camera and ruining the picture , or at any rate making it ridiculous . Montgomery Stone was my host one day on a trip into the country . This was to be a fairy film , for the children , who compose so large a part of moving picture audiences . His part was , as he assured me , the leading one . He played the Sand Man , coming in toward the end of each episode and putting folks to sleep . He was dressed in grotesque tights , his face was painted to look like a funny , wizened little old man , and he wore blue silk shoes which a costumer on the Bowery had assured him were once worn by Fanny Davenport in Gismonda . He is a small man , Miss Davenport was a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the huge automobile were two German policemen ( why German I do n't know , unless  |p496  they were supposed to be more comic ) , a coquettish damsel with a market basket , a farmer , a burglar , a stage manager , and the camera man . First we went to the Bronx Park . " My , I think I 've posed behind every tree in this Park , " said the coquettish damsel . The machine stopped by a rustic bench , the camera was set up , and rehearsals began . But suddenly , out of nowhere , emerged seventeen small boys , several men , a buggy , two baby carriages , a family picnic and a touring car . " Pipe de fake cops , " said the small boys . " Aw , go home ' n ' put your pants on ! " they continued , to the Sand Man . We all climbed sheepishly back into the machine and drove hastily away . Presently we found a more secluded bench , and this time had better luck . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench , the Sand Man , with much merrily malicious pantomine , hopped out of the Bronx woods and threw sand over them , and they went to sleep , their heads on each other 's shoulders . Then along came the sergeant , woke them up , and sent his poor astonished patrolman angrily about his beat . " I 'm afraid I went to sleep too quick , " said the coquettish maiden , when the camera had stopped buzzing . " It will spoil the artistic effect , if I did . " Then we bowled out into the open country , miles and miles , till the city was far behind and a little farm appeared by the wayside . Again the car stopped and the stage manager held parley with the farmer , who grinned presently , put something green into his pocket , and went to hitch up his team . We all climbed out , into the barn yard . While the picture was being rehearsed I was pressed into service to gather local color . This task consisted of scattering grain out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chick , chick , chick ! " till the hens had been lured into the field of the camera . I was glad to assist in so artistic a manner . This picture went off very well , in spite of the fact that the farmer 's horse was only an amateur actor . The Sand Alan put the farmer to sleep , the horse ran into the stable , the bags of grain were upset , all according to schedule . The week before , they told me , a professional horse , who had behaved perfectly in rehearsal , lying down calmly and playing dead , got up and ambled  |p497  off stage while the picture was being taken . He waited till a hundred and seventy-five feet of film had been used , too , to make his little joke more expensive . Meanwhile , the two cops had converted themselves into hoboes , using the barn for a dressing-room , and we all adjourned down a lane near the road . Here my task was to drive a herd of cows into the field of the camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . During the rehearsal , the two hoboes , who were supposed to be fighting over a loaf of bread , yelled at one another at the top of their lungs . A man who was driving by in the road with a load of " Genuine New England Pies , " pulled up and watched . Several small boys had mysteriously appeared ; they always do . But these were rural small boys , and they had better manners , confining their remarks to themselves . It was a curious sight ? the peaceful country lane , the cows placidly browsing over the wall , artistically arranged by the proud author , the Sand Man , clad in red tights , hopping from behind a barberry bush , the tattered hoboes , rouged , with false whiskers , the stage manager , running about shouting orders , the buzzing camera mounted on its straddling tripod , and out on the highway the row of country small boys and the dispenser of indigestion , leaning out of his team in openmouthed astonishment . When the picture was taken , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had not lunched ; and , with milk supplied that morning by the local color , we all sat down on the grass and enjoyed a merry picnic . Everybody was through for the day except the burglar , a terrible looking person just now , who not long ago was a benignant old gentleman in a famous rural play upon the dramatic stage . We found a place for him to burgle ( the verb is his ) on our way home . The sunny west wall of a suburban home invited . The mistress of the house did not look upon the scheme with much favor , but the children demanded consent . With great difficulty they were kept out of the range of the camera , which was mounted in the yard , and then the burglar crept up the side path , glancing ever and anon furtively about , as it is well known burglars do , put a ladder against a  |p498  window , climbed it , peered in , and finally , raising the sash , disappeared . On the other side we heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I close the window for you ? " The Sand Man did not appear in this section of the film . His part was to be taken later , in the studio . All films are not so simple to make as this one , of course , nor so much of a picnic for the players . One firm of manufacturers in Chicago maintains a zoo as part of its stock company of performers ( most firms have at least a half-dozen players , a kind of stock company , who do little else but pose ) . Not only are moving pictures taken of the animals , animal pictures being perennially popular with the children , but scenes are shown in which the animals figure with human beings . This has its dangers . Even if you know that the tigress is only snatching a piece of raw meat from beneath her keeper , who has only pretended to stumble and fall in an attempt to escape from the cage , the picture is sufficiently thrilling when shown on the screen , and sufficiently dangerous for the human performer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition to meet a more exacting public demand , the manufacturers sometimes send cameras , even companies of players , to Florida or Newfoundland or the Rockies for realistic detail ; and large scenes , such as battles , are depicted , also , with the aid perhaps of the state militia , trained horses and gatling guns . A notable foreign film a year ago showed an actual bear hunt in Russia . There is an American Hiawatha picture taken on an Indian reservation , with real Indian actors . The American Mutoscope and Biograph Company are showing a film which is the actual record of a deer hunt in Newfoundland . Pictures of the dredging machines at work on the Panama canal will probably be taken soon , and will surely prove of great interest . Such pictures as these have , of course , a very real educational value . As a member of the New York moving picture censorship board , who is also a superintendent of public schools , said the other day , " A child can perhaps learn more geography from such films in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you reflect that in New York City alone , on a Sunday , 500,000 people go to moving-picture shows , a majority of them perhaps children , and that in the poorer quarters of town every teachers testifies that the children now save their pennies for picture shows instead of candy , you can not dismiss canned drama with a shrug of contempt . It is a big factor in the lives of the masses , to be reckoned with , if possible to be made better , if used for good ends . Eighty per cent . of present day theatrical audiences in this country are canned drama audiences . Ten million people attended professional baseball games in America in 19o8 . Four million people attended moving-picture theaters , it is said , every day , $50,000,000 are invested in the industry . Chicago has over 300 theaters , New York 300 . St. Louis 205 , Philadelphia 186 , even conservative Boston boasts more than 30 . Almost 190 miles of films are unrolled on the screens of America 's 7000 canned drama theaters every day in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an influence to be reckoned with . Much maligned New York has been the first to realize the need for reform . Late in 19o8 the abuse of moving pictures , not only in the sensational nature of the films but in the wretchedly unsanitary condition of the theaters , caused the Mayor to threaten to close up all the temples of canned drama . In self defence , the proprietors of these theaters banded together and asked the People 's Institute to appoint a Board of Censors , who should pass on all pictures exhibited in the city , and also cooperate with the bureau of licenses in cleaning out and making safer the theaters themselves . This has been the means of abolishing from New  |p499  York gross and sensational films , that might incite , by suggestion , to crime . But more than that , it has been , or will be , the means of improving the standard of pictures for the entire country , for the manufacturers do not care to make pictures that will be refused in so many theaters as New York contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the censorship committee valuable suggestions that will help the moving pictures to serve the ends of education . The example of New York might well be followed in other cities . Certainly there are many moving picture theaters everywhere which are still grossly unsanitary and unsafe , though the pictures themselves are being daily improved by the manufacturers . The greatest improvement at present ( and there is still plenty of room for more ) is along the line of dramatic structure and significant acting . Does it sound silly to talk thus pedantically , in the language of dramatic criticism , about moving pictures ? If you will watch a poor American picture unroll blinkingly , and then a good French one , you will feel that it is not silly , after all . You will realize that unconsciously a certain standard of taste , a genuine aesthetic standard , can be set for the children and poor people who frequent canned drama by the millions . You have your standards ? or you should have ? of acting , gesture , facial expression , dramatic unity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be taught , are being taught , to have their standards on the moving picture screen . Canned dramas succeed or fail , like any others , and for very much the same reasons . At present we need not discuss the " pictures that talk . " Though scenes from grand opera , vaudeville acts , condensed versions of famous plays , are already given jointly by the picture machine and the phonograph , the synchronizing process has not yet been perfected , nor is the phonograph yet sufficiently free from metallic quality , to give these " talking pictures " a life-likeness as vivid as that imparted by the imagination to the merely pantomimic dramas . Many inventors , including Edison and Lubin , are working on the process , and believe that in the near future there will be regular " talking picture " theaters all over the world . But time must tell that . For the present , the pantomimic dramas come the nearest to a kind of art in the biograph world . All the dramatic magazines employ regular canned critics now . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rats : Another humorous idea weakened by crude handling . A bibulous cook who has her employers terrified , refuses to be discharged until her master brings home a pair of white rats . Her aversion to the rats causes him to bring home a large supply , which he sets free in the kitchen , and she is glad enough to throw up her job . As the story is developed by the players it begins in the middle and the loses much of its force On the whole , this criticism seems probably mild . Doubtless such reviews have their effect on the manufacturers . When historical scenes are to be reconstructed for the instruction of thousands of children , it is not only desirous that Napoleon or Washington or Edgar Allen Poe should look like the original character , but that all the actors should be correctly costumed and the episodes historically true . But it is also important that ordinary canned dramas be not only free from brutality , coarseness and suggestions to crime , but that they be constructed with imagination , told with interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have canned dramas , we must see to it that we have good ones . And here the French are far ahead of us ? not always in the moral tone of their subject matter , but almost universally in dramatic interest and in the quality of the acting . The same superiorities prevail as in the regular theater . The firm of Pattie ' Freres leads the world . None disputes their supremacy . They have three plants near Paris and one at Nice . They employ an army of 3500 men and women .  |p500  Their photographic and reproductive processes are the best . But , above all , they employ the best actors and playwrights . In America the canned dramas are mostly patched up by the stage manager , or somebody employed for the purpose . They are disjointed , episodic , often dolefully commonplace and uninteresting in idea . The best French canned dramas are really dramas , with a beginning , a middle and an end . They have development , climax . Often they have , even for the sophisticated observer , a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the so called " films d'art " of the Pathe Freres are written and acted by the leading authors and actors of Paris . You smile at the thought of Mrs. Fiske or E. H. Sothern acting in a moving picture devised by Clyde Fitch oc Augustus Thomas or William Vaughn Moody . But why is the idea more absurd than that of Caruso or Melba singing into a talking machine ? Certainly , even in America , you can see Le Bargy of the Comedic Francaise acting a canned drama written by Henri Levedan , of the Academic , author of " The Duel ; " or Mounet-Sully , or even the Divine Sarah herself . Jules Lemaitre and Edmond Rostand have written canned dramas . Even Duse is soon to appear in one . When actors and authors of this stamp turn their attention to moving pictures , the result is something quite different from the horse-play films you , perhaps , have seen . It explains why canned drama at ten cents is bound to continue a formidable rival to tawdry melodrama and vaudeville at fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Return of Ulysses , " by Jules Lemaitre , acted by Mme. Bartet and M. M. Lambert , Delanny and Paul Mounet , all members of the Comedie ? a picture of great educational interest to children ; " The Kiss of Judas , " a sacred drama by Henri Levedan , acted by Lambert as Christ and Mounet-Sully as Judas ; " The Assassination of the Duke of Guise , " by Levedan , an historical episode with Le Bargy in the title part ; and Sardou 's " La Tosca , " prepared for pantomime and acted by Mme. Sorel , with Le Bargy as Baron Scarpia . These are real dramas , with real actors portraying real emotions . Considering who the people are that frequent moving picture shows , their effect can not fail to be for good ; they make for the elevation of taste , for a better understanding of theatric art . And it is quite conceivable that if some American playwrights should cease turning their plays into bad novels , using their superfluous imagination to devise genuine canned dramas , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera , the moving picture audiences through the country might in time learn to appreciate the superior quality of these playwrights and players , and to desire a closer view of them ; might even in time fill anew our now empty galleries . In the older days the American gallery , like the English pit , held gods ? and goddesses . Now , in the larger cities , only Shakespeare or the most popular plays can fill the galleries of a first class theater . Popular melodramas , since moving pictures became the rage , have decreased fifty per cent . in number . But the first class theaters lost their gallery patronage long before moving pictures sprang up . They lost it because the older generation of gallery goers were comparatively educated Americans of moderate means , who were not ashamed to sit upstairs . The newer generation of such Americans must sit down amid the shirt fronts , or nowhere ; and the people who would be willing to sit unashamed in the galleries now are not of the intellectual standard to appreciate the better kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If our theater galleries are ever filled again , it will be by recruits educated up from the urban masses . But before these utopian results can be brought about in the moving picture world of America , the American manufacturers will have to experience a change of heart . At present they appear to be loath to go to the expense involved in securing real authors and high-class actors . And possibly our actors , being notoriously so much better than Duse or Le Bargy , would have to experience a change of heart , also , before consenting to compromise their dignity in the presence of a moving-picture camera . Maude Adams is said , by her press agent , to have refused $50,000 to play before the picture machine . But , if canned dramas are to retain their present extraordinary hold over the public , they can only do it , after the novelty has worn off , by being genuine dramas , well planned and well played . When they are well planned and well played it is quite possible that they can always fill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up toward an appreciation of true dramatic art , which is , after all , only brought to flower on the stage of a true theater , where actual men and women speak with the voices God gave them .
