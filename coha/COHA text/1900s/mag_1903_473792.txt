TMS was up where the Norwegian coast-line begins to shoulder away to the easterly arctic . Made up of slabs of rock set on edge , and just enough of them bunched to entitle the whole thing to be set down on the chart as an island , with everywhere fissures which only the most agile of our Lapps dared to more than crawl around ? and they were shod with clinging , straw-stuffed moccasins , ? there it was , fifteen miles or so from Hammerfest ? good fishing and a handy market , ? that this band of sca-Lapps had taken station for the summer to fish for sei , or whatever else might come their way , under the light of the midnight sun . It had the look of a place whe.roon the nimble mountain-goat would need to have a care as to how he cut his capers , provided , of course , that so shrewd a creature could ever beinduced to think that he might find there sufficient provender to keep him alive . In half-rough weather a man had to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there a bit of ledge breaking through the swash offered a chance . Forty or fifty feet above the sea-line , well up on one of the higher perches , our Lapps had their shack , an arrangement that was roofed over with the meagre turf of the region , and sided in by hoards that must have been washed onto their shores after long drifting , so old and battered did they look . Within the outer door of this shack was a space that served for a storeroom , and cast in confusion on the floor and hung in any old way on the walls and from the roof , and all contributing to the appearance of disorder , were buoys , cans , kegs , nets , lines ? the fishing-gear not in immediate use , ? with some dried fish , a tub of lard , and a few odd utensils of a household over which , plainly , no woman had for some time presided . Beyond the inner door . which was hung on leather hinges and not quite plumb as to the hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen feet on a side , and in each corner a bunk about five feet square and meant to accommodate four ? for Lapps are neither tall nor bulky ? was raised clear of the floor by wooden props , with bedding made up of the skins of goat and reindeer , and of such of their own garments , goat and reindeer skin also , as they cared not to wear at the moment . Within that room dwelt our sixteen Lapps . On one side of the room the wall space between the bunks was taken up by the door , but on each of the other three sides was a small window , to let in by way of the unwashed glass a shade of the light of heaven onto a narrow board that answered for a table , and so placed , with reference to the bunks , that the newly awakened had only to slide out feet first or roll broad on to find them-selves at once in a position to eat , with the bench-ll ? ard affixed to the edge of the bunks forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tough deerskin tunics and trousers , shone most smoothly , except where they were marked by the work of bait-cutting , for which , and doubtless other service , there hung from each an 's belt a knife in a deer-1 horn sheath . In what w s left of the room , a central space about five feet square , was the fireplace , elevat on a bed of ins the wood ungauged de ened beyond reclamation , reposed on dangling don from what must 1 to ) : called them the m thhearth , and an rafters was a chain for cooking purposes . Encircling the walls of the room , above the bunks and little windows , was a line of shelving , on which reposed the rare household ware and the still more precious fish ng-gear not yet baptized ? hooks , hand- affs , thole-pins , corks , and so on . All the earns in the place were swathed in soot ; and in this room , where sixteen men cooked , ate , slept , and talked long days away , one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change and took on dark hues ; and as the floor was of earth and The rain came through the roof by way of an opening that was a chimney when it was riot shut up tight , one may be able to imagine that there were also times when it was heavy going underfoot . Outside in the free air , set up on the highest of all the rocky peaks of the island , was the lookout 's tower ? a square of small loosely piled stones , through the crevices of which the winds of the north might whistle and the arctic rains enterif so it pleased them ; and whoever was standing watch for the time took station therein and looked out onto the fiord for the schools of blackfish by which these people lived through the summer , and , while living , saved enough ? sometimes to manage to exist through the long winter . All hands were more or less on watch when they were not sleeping . To look far out and scan the wind-whipped waters of the fiord seemed to be as natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bosom , hunch the shoulders , and draw a deep breath ? but they slept a great deal , we judged , and the man watching up in the tower should of course be able to see the fish first . It was after twelve o'clock on this July night that the lookout in the eyrie reported a school of sei coming across the fiord . We looked for ourselves , and we too saw the circling sea-gulls , and beneath them the elsewhere smooth surface of the fiord ruffled black like a tide-rip . The lookout 's call of " Fish-0 ! " or some word that meant the same thing , assembled the loiterers on the rock and awoke the sleepers in the shack . There was no dressing . Some had to put on their caps and others their belts with the dangling knife , but . that done , all was ready . Four or five rushed up to get the brown-tanned net , which had been hanging up to dry , with a board roof for protection against the elements . Two of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dime museums , but more slowly moving , wound the net around their shoulders ; then , with two other men to take up the sag in the bight of it , and all making what speed they could , they stumbled down the rough declivities to the boats . The boats , undeeked , shout thirty feet long , seven feet beam , and loose rock in the bottom for ballast , were clinker-built , and after the models that have been handed down from Viking daysupeurved stem and stern ? carved , decorated , and gilded . They were gaudily painted ? green , blue , red , yellow , and the rest of the - prismatic belt . One could easily believe that they would scud pretty well , but hardly that they would be the best boats in the world to drive by the wind in a gale ; and looking at the frail build of them and then at the jagged coast-line all about , one would also prefer not to be running to harbor in them on a black winter 's night . Four boats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming school . All hands are rowing , each with as much as he can handle in one long clumsy oar . To the man who has no other occupation than to curl up in the bow and watch them , it seems that they are doing a lot of talking for people with business ahead . As we near the school , which is coming on leisurely , with the gulls still circling and screaming above , and every POW and then diving , arising , and making off triumphant , the captain of the ex pedition ? rare - looking enough for a Lapp , because of a flowing beard with a curl to it ? he is probably half Finn ? begins to talk more than all the others together . But his speech is to some purpose ? it seems to be orders that he is spitting out , for the men change the course slightly and row more earnestly and with less to say for themselves . The net is in the captain 's boat . He waves his arm toward one boat . and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a line , which the captain makes fast to one corner of the net and drops overboard . A boat to the other side of them heaves the end of a line , and it likewise is given a corner , as also a moment later is the third boat . They TOW farther out then , drawing the net after them , and soon it is spread below the surface , with each boat making the corner of a square that is possibly a hundred feet on a side . The net itself seems to be seventy feet by sixty . The fish come nn , with everybody keeping quiet as they approach . To the captain 's orders the boats again change direction , holding the corner lines taut always . All are rowing hard , and particularly the crew of the boat to windward , Lapps seem not to be of a race of gifted oarsmen , and there is an endless amount of deep digging and any amount of splashing . When the fish are almost in the right place the mouths of our fishermen begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now they must not let the boats drift away . These seem to be creatures not easily startled . Some fish would be off and into the wide Atlantic by now , but not these gentlemen . They come slowly but certainly . In the boats they are trying to keep quiet while the fish are getting within limits , and beyond the grinding of the oar - shafts between the tholepins and the splashing of the blades in the water , they are doing pretty well . At least they have stopped talking . The sei push over the dead-line , and the men standing by the corner-lines begin to get nervous . But not yet . The captain warns them with uplifted arm , and low words that must be fine oaths in Lapp language , ? which is not quite Norwegian , nor yet Swedish nor Finnish , but seemingly flavored with all three . It comes at last ? the sharp word of command . The front line of the advancing ripple is yet some distance from the inshore edge of the net , with the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain gives the word . The men seem hardly to have waited for him ? two men in each boat begin to haul , while the others still tug , and now more diligently than ever , at the oars . The hauling continues and the fish are crowded into the middle of the net , thereby helping out the plans of the fishermen , who seem to have them pretty well under control , although the sei , at last seemingly aware of the scheme , are flurrying against capture ? but flurrying , of course , to no purpose . When the net is lifted and the fish safe aboard two of the boats ? and it does not take long to gaff them in ? the little fleet row back rather leisurely to the island , where the net is at once taken ashore and carried up on the - rocks to be dried out again . The catch , which must weigh nearly a ton , is put into one boat , and , we are told , will at once be taken to Hammerfest to market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They do not leave immediately . They are not drivers , these Lapps , and there are some little preliminaries . First , all hands must repair to the shack and have a bite of pmething to eat after that spurt . After toil , food and rest . So , with a notion of coffee ahead , the five black kettles are raised up and put into action , the long hard loaves of bread are cut and the butter made ready , with the cheese , goat 's and reindeer 's milk , and sugar for some , and even canned milk for others . Two or three produce a little cognac . Each man is his own caterer and cook , and they are all busy . The drops of sweat are still on their brows while they eat , and the lustre of conflict yet in their eyes . What internal turmoil would be raised in these if they really did drive for a few hours after the manner of some fishermen there is no telling1 Probably they would go on strike . The four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ready at last . It was five in the morning when we left , and sailing across the lightly cuppingwaters we were swamped in light . It had been broad light of course all night , with the sun in the northern sky , but now it was more ? there was a glow tu it . The elernal ' , mows on the crests of the heights burned under it , and the brown-tanned sails of the Finn and Lapp boats grew warm under it ; the white sails of the Russian traders were dazzling ; even the high-piled lumber on the deck of a south-bound tramp threw out a suggestion of something not on the bills of lading. ; and the tourist steamer with her glittering f14s t ? she was freighted with dreams . AWoard our boat there was no great pressure of business on the way . One man steered while the others dressed fish . It seemed a shame to throw heads and intestines into that clean , green water , but there was no other place to cast them . And so they worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heading for the one particular corner that is given over to the Lapps in Harnmerfest harbor . The master of a pole-masted , green-painted Russian , a schooner with a green hull and blue galley , with the hand of a gilded figurehead pointing her course and windows looking out astern , made an raffia . for the fish , and soon our fellows were hoisting them over the side ; where , after being weighed in an antiquated balance with a twenty-kilogram rock on the pan , they were salted on deck , and then passed on to be kenched below . We left them there , but that afternoon we met them again . They had been devoting some of the proceeds to seeing the town . You can walk the length of 1Tammerfest in five minutes and the breadth of it in twenty- seconds ? it is a shelf of a town at the foot of a hill , which strangers climb to view the midnight sun , but it is doubtful if these Lapps believed the alleged Paris to he a circumstance to it . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all drunk and proud of it , and leading by a piece of marline a woful-looking dog that was keeping as far in their wake as he could and not get choked to death . Every friend they met was shown four fine flasks of cognac , and if he liked he could step behind the nearest house and have a nip for old acquaintance ' sake . For themselves , they cared not for the sheltering house . Hooh ! They had sold their fish ? eight hundred and fifty kilos ? for sixteen kroner the hundred kilo , and they were going to adopt the dog and make him happy for life . Would their American friends have a little touch under the light of the fine sun ? Was it not a day ' for angels to he abroad ? ? oh , most beautiful . By and by , with two beaming Lapp ladies , also in trousers , tunics , and stuffed moccasins , they stopped and had a cup of chocolate , a few hard-boiled eggs , some cherry lemonade , and sugared bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks and spread their wares on the tops of dry-goods boxes on the street leading down to the Lapp dock . At this time they had lost the dog . Later , from a store up in the square they bought needed rations for the comrades on the island ; and yet later , at an hour that would be called dark evening in zones where the sun sets once a day , they collected themselves and sailed away . They were happy by then ? not a whisper out of them , but all smiles . We saluted the single brown square sail of their otering as it passed by , and no doubt they arrived hi due time at the little island up in the fiord , to rejoice their companions with the commissary purchases and what was left of the cash receipts .
