N the Tenth Book of his Noctes Atticce , Aulus Genius tells us of a con- troversy about usage which had once taken place in the language in which he wrote . The decision was referred to the one man who seems to have been deemed even then ? what every one regards him now ? the highest authority on disputed points of Latin speech . Pompey was about to dedicate the Temple of Victory , upon which his name and honors were to be inscribed . The success to be commemorated had been achieved during his third consulate . The question arose whether the proper form for the numeral should be tertium or tertio . The matter in dispute had been submitted to the most learned experts in Rome . As is the right and custom of learned , experts , they took exactly opposite sides . As a final authority , Pompey referred the point to Cicero . But Cicero was unwilling to pronounce a positive decision . He was afraid , says the chronicler , that he should seem to disapprove of the men themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use neither tertium nor tertio , but to stop at the end of the second 1 , thereby giving to the word the incomplete form tert . The moaning in that case would be plain to all . Both sides in the dispute would be happy , each appending to the unfinished word the termination which suited itself . The advice was adopted . Accordingly , nothing but tert. appeared engraven on the stone . The controverted point seems indeed never to have been authoritatively settled . Later , when the temple was renovated , the inscription was renewed ; but the Roman numeral III then took the place of tort . Gellius tells us that he got the story just recounted from a letter of Tiro , the freedman of Cicero . It has more than once been spoken of as an illustration of the great orator 's non-committal attitude , of his desire to be on CXVII. ? No , 59 ' 7-14good terms with both parties in any controversy that came up . This view is indeed implied in the account given by the chronicler . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable , and not unlikely far more correct , which will occur to the student of speech . Unlike the heaven-inspired purists we have with us always , Cicero could hardly have failed to be aware that there are many questions of usage which can never be safely decided offhand ; that to reach a conclusion which can endure criticism and examination requires often a long and wide range of investigation . This very likely he had neither the time nor the means to make . As , therefore , he was not clear in his mind as to the point in dispute , he declined to act as arbiter , and recommended instead a course which would leave the matter open . The story is something besides being true ; it is both interesting and important . It shows that controversies about correctness of usage were as rife in the Latin tongue as they are in the English ; that questions similar to those which afflict the writer of to-day afflicted the writer of the past ; and that in Cicero 's time , as in our own , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same expressions . All this , indeed , might have been inferred ; it is something to have it known positively . For much of ancient testimony bearing directly or indirectly upon the subject of verbal criticism has disappeared in consequence of the wreck and loss which overtook classical literature . Still , the scanty records which have come down suffice to show that in this as well as in other matters the acts and feelings of the men of antiquity were not essentially different from those characterizing the men of modern times . But there are other resemblances between the past and the present to be noted besides the mere feet of the existence of controversy about usage . For these there is in particular one piece of evidence well worth citing , coming as it does from one of the great authors of antiquity . At the beginning of his treatise on the Failure of the Oracles , Plutarch tells us of a conversation in which there is a distinct reference to discussions of usage . He represents a party of friends at Delphi going to the Cnidian hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found there were spending their time very leisurely , some anointing themselves , others engaged in nothing more arduous than the contemplation of the wrestlers . This leads one of the visitors to comment upon the appearance of those whom they had come to seek . " It seems to me , " he says , " that you are not discoursing of any matter of great consequence , for I see that you labor not . under deep thought . " The reply runs essentially to the following effect . They most assuredly were not occupied with any really profound discussion . They were not , fur instance , disputing whether the word belle loses one of its l 's in the f uture tense ; or from what positive certain superlatives , such as cheiriston , and beltiston , were derived . These are the sort of questions , it is added , that make men knit their brows . About other matters , such , for illustration , as those of philosophy , discussion could go on with calmness . But questions of grammar call at once into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several points of similarity between ancient and modern times are indicated in this passage besides the confirmation it brings of the prevalence in the former of discussions of usage . One is the exceeding violence with which these discussions are carried on . Controversy is almost certain to assume its bitterest tone when it deals with the propriety of words and phrases . The fact has been often remarked ; the reason for it , or at least one reason for it , seems to me to lie on the surface . Every one is almost sure to employ the language as he has been in the habit of hearing it spoken , or to some extent as he is accustomed to read it written . Naturally he is annoyed at the charge of having been guilty of solecisms or of bad grammar . He is none the less so if he is - uncertain , ashe often is uncertain , whether the charge be true or false . For it is the accusation itself that is offensive . It seems to imply that his position in life is doubtful ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station in which violation of idiom constitutes part of the ineffaceable records of earliest youth . The imputation of bad English conveys a social stigma . Men in consequence resent an attack upon their grammar far more fiercely than one upon their morals . Vice belongs to all ranks ; but impropriety of speech is , in theory at least , supposed to be confined to persons of inferior condition . At all events , whatever the reason of the bitterness displayed , there can be no doubt of the fact . Plutarch noticed it in his time ; we have plenty of opportunities to notice it in our time . It is no uncommon circumstance to find in a newspaper a communication in which fault is found with particular words or expressions which have been employed by some author of the first class . Occasionally the writer is good enough to demonstrate his superiority still further by recasting a whole sentence in order to show how easily it could be improved . His letter is fairly sure to be followed by one from another correspondent who sets out to correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , always earnest , and generally bitter . It frequently ends with no other result than that of leaving a firm conviction in the mind of each disputant that the other is an ignoramus , if not an idiot , and A general impression on the part of the public that both are about right . But even more noticeable than the violence of these discussions about usage , implied in the passage cited from Plutarch , is the contempt expressed for them which he hardly takes the pains to conceal . In this there is no question that he represents the feelings of the large majority of great authors , whether of the past or the present . Yet why should this be so ? Why should verbal criticism be looked upon so disdainfully by men of literary eminence ? Every writer , be he great or small , practises it sometimes upon himself , and is careful not to neglect his neighbors . The interest in it among cultivated men is so wide-spread that it may fairly be called universal . Discussions of usage abound on every side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all . There is probably not a single instructor in English throughout the land who does not find himself appealed to constantly to decide upon the propriety of particular locutions ; and if he appreciates his limitations , he will often find himself perplexed what to say in reply . Furthermore , within a certain range instruction in the subject is something more than desirable . It is essential ; as such it is recognized in our schools . Why , then , should the practice of verbal criticism have fallen so largely into disrepute with those best qualified to pronounce upon the value of the utterances of those essaying it ? To this question a partial , if not a complete , answer may be found in the portrayal of the condition of things which we find existing . Verbal criticism is one of the most difficult of tasks ; as commonly pursued it is treated as one of the easiest . It frequently amounts to little more than the expression of personal likes or dislikes , Yet there are three things upon which the practice of it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these is the knowledge of the principles which regulate the growth of language and propriety of expression . This implies that the contradictory influences which operate upon speech are understood . Secondly , there must be knowledge of the origin and history of the words , inflections , constructions , and idioms which are made the subject of discussion . The third is the knowledge , so far as it can be gained , of the usage of the greatest authors ? the all-sufficient standard of propriety . To the writer this last requirement is the only one of importance . To the fully equipped verbal critic all three are essential . But as the acquisition of these three requisites requires much labor and long investigation , most verbal critics escape from the trouble involved and the uncertainty frequently resulting by spending no labor and making no investigation at all . They rely upon what they call their reason , by which they mean their unenlightened understanding . They are very much in the condition of thepeasant who has enough common sense , as he terms it , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn the idea that it goes round the sun . If we all can recognize the folly of the confidence reposed by the peasant in the testimony of his eyes , is there any wonder that the views of the untrained intellectual vision in matters of usage should be regarded by those who have sat at the feet of the great masters of our speech as arising mainly from a combination of ignorance , inefficiency , and self-sufficiency ? Coleridge declared that there were passages in Plato which conveyed to him no meaning . He did not venture for that reason to speak of them as meaningless . There were other passages in this same philosopher which at one time had seemed to him incomprehensible . With increased knowledge and experience and reflection they had become perfectly clear . On the other hand , there were bewildering obscurities in certain writers which gave him no difficulty to comprehend , because he could see the hollowness of the reasoning and the consequent mental confusion out of which they had sprung . This led him to lay down the following famous dictum : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant of his understanding . " True as this is of thought , it is just as true of the language in which thought is expressed . The construction we find may puzzle us to analyze , or , as is technically said , to parse . That , however , does not prove its lack of correctness ; it merely indicates our lack of knowledgeThere are phrases and idioms used by every reputable author in our speech which , with the results of research we yet have at command , it is difficult , if not impossible , to resolve into their constituent elements . They still await a satisfactory explanation . In time it will come . Some of the things which troubled our fathers 110 longer trouble us . It is , for instance , only within the past fifty years that the construction of li-ad had rather , and had better with the infinitive has been successfully analyzed , its mystery dissipated , and its grammatical correctness established . With the increasing attention which is coming to be paid to the study of our speech , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the mean time , with our ignorance of the elements that enter into their construction , all that it behooves us to do is to accept as correct what has been employed by the men who set for us the standard of good usage . Books specially devoted to the subject of verbal criticism may be useful . Some of them certainly are . But their value must always depend upon the extent to which they have conformed their teachings to the practice of the great writers of our speech . There are those among their compilers who seem to think that the only use to be made of such writers is to furnish examples of assumed errors of expression . Treatises prepared in this spirit naturally abound in mistakes and misstatements , and in consequence do more harm than good . For writing , it must be kept in mind , is an imitative art . The all-important thing for the beginner , therefore , is to have constantly in his thoughts and before his eyes something worth imitating . It is not rules he needs so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to verbal criticism the one great requisite for the production of anything authoritative is the knowledge of the usage of the classic authors of our language . But as yet this has been but imperfectly ascertained . On many disputed points , therefore , the wise man will follow the example of Cicero and express no opinion at all . Fortunately , however , for the users of our speech , there is one volume ? the most widely read and circulated of all ? which has done more for the preservation of purity and propriety of utterance than any other single agency . It was for generations the chosen companion of all men , from the highest to the humblest . Consciously or unconsciously it was adopted by every one as a guide to the best usage . Never , perhaps , in the history of any tongue has a single book so profoundly affected universal expression as has the English Bible . It is not that we now talk or write in the diction employed in it . Even in its own day the language it employed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effectiveness made it serve from the beginning as a standard of speech about which the language revolved and from which it has never got very far . It held up before all an ideal of pure and lofty expression . The familiarity of our fathers with the translation of the Bible , the intimate acquaintance they gained with its words and phrases , its constructions , its manner has done inure to maintain the purity of our speech than could have been effected by the mastery of all the manuals of verbal criticism which have ever been produced . I am not unaware that different views are entertained by some as to the value of this work as a linguistic guide . In certain grammars passages are taken from it to illustrate what is called false syntax . The large majority of these are illustrations not of the lack of correctness in the Bible , but of lack of knowledge in the verbal critic . It may not he in the best of taste to bring into the discussion of general principles a recital of personal experience . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded by the incident , is so germane to the topic under discussion that the violation of decorum may be pardoned for the view it furnishes of the singular attitude taken by some persons towards a work which has exercised so profound an influence not only upon the development of our speech , but upon individual expression . Like all instructors in English I frequently receive letters dealing with matters of usage . Sometimes they are taken up with the discussion of some general question . One of the latter sort once came to me from a stranger who wrote ostensibly in quest of information . The subject of inquiry was the language of the Authorized Version of the Bible . About the linguistic merits of that work my correspondent had very pronounced views . Though expressed in general terms and not illustrated by examples , they were distinctly unfavorable to its grammatical excellence . It is true , the opinions were put forth in the form of questions ; but it was very evident that an answer was expected in confirmation of their correctness . This , however , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter I felt compelled to express a decided dissent . Nothing daunted , the writer returned to the charge . Several usages were referred to in his answer which , in his opinion , could not be reconciled with the injunctions of the latest grammarians . A number of passages were quoted to show the ignorance of the language on the part of the translators . They really displayed , as was to be expected , the ignorance of the critic and his utter unconsciousness of his ignorance . One of the sentences cited for censure was the familiar text to be found in the Eightyfourth Psalm : " I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness . " To it , however , no special attention was called . Accordingly my reply , while pointing out errors in certain other statements , contained nothing but a bare reference to this verse . It was simply included among the number of those cited as objectionable which were declared to be perfectly proper . They were not only still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grammar of the Bible is wrong , so , it necessarily followed , must be that of about every great author from whom we derive our conception of what constitutes good grammar itself . At once came a vigorous rejoinder which , indeed , it would not be out of the way to call violent . The indignation of my correspondent had been , it was clear , steadily growing at the dissent from views for which he expected unqualified approval . Hence the letter he now wrote was more than insistent of the previous opinion ; it was exultant , as if he had scored a personal triumph . The role of humble inquirer was laid aside ; that of severe and stern critic took its place . He called attention in particular to the text which is given above . He affected surprise at the gross oversight of which so eminent a linguistic scholar , as he was sarcastically pleased to term me , had been guilty ; and he turned the blade in the wound by italicizing the adjective eminent . His exact words are not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following effect : How can you stand up for such a barbarism ? Omit the rather and you have had be . I should like you to parse that if you can . Its impropriety is seen the moment one examines it closely , as you clearly have not done . Doesthe insertion of rather between the two words turn an ungrammatical expression into a grammatical one ? Then , after you have disposed of had be , what are you going to do with the to before dwell ? There it has no business to be . The sentence can not he parsed . Life is short , and the correspondence threatened to be very long . It is , furthermore , distinctly trying to have some one announcing to you the commonest of commonplace facts with the air of a Columbus returning from the discovery of a new world . Besides , there was conveyed an implied disparagement of my own Intele lectual processes in the assumption that considerations so aggressively obvious as those adduced should have escaped the notice of any person who had paid the slightest attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont to receive with meekness and without reply the chastenings which the austerer guardians of the purity of speech feel compelled to inflict upon me for my linguistic frailties , whether their censures take the form of published comment or private communication . One becomes in time too conscious of his own limitations , of his liability to error from haste or inadvertence or from pure unadulterated ignorance , to place any undue confidence in his own impeccability . Even when I recognize in the castigation nothing but conclusions reached by wrong reasoning based upon inadequate investigation , I am not at all animated by the feelings which lead men to found societies for the diffusion of - useful knowledge . So I ordinarily bear my punishment without protest . But there are times when the most abject of trodden worms will turn . This seemed to me a peculiarly fitting occasion to turn . The letter had been something more than patronizing and pretentious . It was unmistakably meantto be offensive . So I sent a reply intended to close the correspondence . This , I may add , it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the particular point under consideration . Instead , I gave my correspondent a general discourse about the grammar of the book against which he had been inveighing . Substantially it was to the following effect : Make up your mind that in general the Bible is a guide to be followed grammatically as much as it is morally . The language of our version belongs to the sixteenth century . It , therefore , naturally contains expressions which , though proper at that time , are not in accord with the common usage of our day . When it was originally translated , which , was generally the relative pronoun referring to persons . Hence we say , Our Father which art in heaven . When it was translated , the cases of the pronoun had not been confounded , nor had the forms of the objective intruded themselves into the nominative . Hence it says , Ye are the light of the world , and not you . When it was translated , the Northern ending in -s of the third person singular of the present tense had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Midland . Consequently it does not say , Ile loves , he hates , he does , but he loveth , he hateth , he cloth . More than this , the subtle distinction found in the employment of shall and will had not then become established in the language . There are other variations from the existing practice . But these do not affect the correctness of its procedure in regard to expressions still met with everywhere . In such cases accept its authority without question , and conform your practice to it ; and do not be disturbed by any criticism of it coming from persons who know as little of the history of the speedh as you manifestly do yourself . You tell me you can not parse had rather be . It is not essential either to your happiness or to your salvation that you should parse it . It is enough for you to be told that the Bible authorizes it , and that there are plenty of men who are able to parse it . Now no one is likely to stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible . There are unquestionably grammatical faults in it , though the number of these is far fewer than is often asserted . Still , those exist for which no defence can be pleaded on the score of baste or inadvertence . They are as intentional as are some of the violations of idiomatic usage into which modern scrupulosity occasionally betrays men . One of the errors committed in it there is which deserves mention for several reasons , but most of all here for the lesson in verbal criticism it imparts . First , it was not accidental , but clearly deliberate . Secondly , it is found not infrequently at the present day , sometimes because the writer is careless , but more often because he is trying to be careful without knowing how . The third and much the most important reason is that it exemplifies strikingly the other side of Coleridge 's dictum . Here is an instance where we can understand the writer 's ignorance , or , strictly speaking , the confusion in his mind between two different constructions . The place in our version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gospels where Christ is represented as asking the opinion of His disciples as to the view entertained of Him by people in general and by themselves in particular . " Whom do men say that I am ? " is the question as it appears in . Matthew . This may be taken as the representative of all the six instances of the occurrence of the construction . Its employment was due to no inadvertence . It is essentially the same in the account as found in each of the first three Gospels . It must accordingly have received the assent of all the scholars engaged in the preparation of the Authorized Version . The same error is found not unfrequently now in the writings of men who can hardly plead haste as an excuse and sometimes not even carelessness . The construction has been occasionally employed by authors of some repute who have clearly resorted to it deliberately . For example : it appears so regularly in the writings of Bret Harte that it is manifest that he took especial pains to make use of it under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sentences like the two following turn up constantly in his tales : The revelation came from people whom be wa s conscious were the inferiors of himself and his wife . The young companion of the doctor whom she learned was the doctor 's factor . In all such cases the error arises from the confusion of two constructions , the mingling of which has been brought about by the intervention of a clause containing another verb . It would never be made if one simple fact were kept in mind . The verb to be takes the same case after it as before it . If one of the finite tenses be used , both the subject and the subject predicate are necessarily in the nominative . If it be the infinitive which is employed , it is the accusative that must appear in both instances , or , to adopt English grammatical terminology , the objective . No one would think of asking such a question as , " Whom am II " Yet it is a thing of this very sort which is done in the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two subjects had been separated by an intervening verb . On the other hand , it would have been grammatically correct , even if rather unusual , to put the question in this form , " Whom do men say me to be ? " This is essentially the form of this passage as it is found in the WyeHite version of the fourteenth century . In Purver 's recension of that work , in the account of the conversation as recorded by Mark and Luke , the confusion of the two constructions began . It was perpetuated in most of the sixteenth century translations . To a certain extent some of them wavered between the right and the wrong one . The King James version adopted the incorrect construeHon throughout , while the recent revised version reads properly in all these cases who instead of whom . Still , lapses of this sort are rare in the translation . All taken together will little affect the truth of the assertion that teen who are guided by the usage of the Bible will very seldom go wrong linguistically , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consummate verbal critic entirely independent of the three essential ones already specified . It is one which puts him who possesses it on a level , so far as it goes , with the great writer . It is not the mere perception of what is good in expression that is meant ; it is the line sense of - what is the very best . With it genius is endowed ; by others it can be acquired only by the closest familiarity with the works of genius . Many men , and sometimes able men , have no conception of this final outcome of the most highly developed literary taste . They , therefore , affect to disbelieve the conclusion it reaches . Him who has it not , it is as useless to attempt to convince of its reality as it would he to point out the comparative merits of different musical passages to one whose ear would not enable him to distinguish between tunes as unlike as " God Save the King " and " Hail , Columbia . " And as this paper has been largely given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be well to end it with something from the same author with whom it began which bears directly upon the point just taken . In this instance the story which Aulus Gallus tells us does not concern a great writer , but a great grammarian . This was that Valerius Probus who flourished about the beginning of the second century and wrote commentaries on Virgil . In his possession he had a copy of the " Georgics " corrected by the hand of the poet himself . The grammarian was asked by one of his disciples whether it was proper to say urbes or urbis , turrem or turrim. lie answered that both were correct ; that in any particular case the choice would be determined by the ear . " Do not , " said he , " pay heed to the stale definitions and dirty cesspools of grammarians . " For the word here rendered " stale " he used an adjective a good deal stronger ; but that epithet will convey euphemistically the idea expressed in the original much more vigorously . To enforce his injunction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which he had used either the one form or the other according to euphony . As his citations came from a manuscript corrected by the hand of the author himself , the variations could not be ascribed to any carelessness on the part of the scribes . But the person who made the inquiry , Gelling tells - us , was little cultured , and had the ear of one brought up in the rural districts . For the life of him , he said to the master , he could not see why the one form should be better in any given place than the other would have been . At this reply Probus was a good deal irritated . " If that he so , " said he . " do n't worry about trying to ascertain whether you ought to say urbis or urbes . For since you are the kind of man you show yourself to be , it will make no difference to you whether you use the one form or the other . " " With these words , " continues Genius , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont with the stupid and unteachable. "
