txt The just published trade returns for England and the United States fit together like two gloves , and throw light upon the moot point whether we are borrowing abroad or collecting our due . Our exports of breadstuffs decreased nearly $12,000,000 , and our exports of cotton increased $31,000,000 . Other decreases of minor Items leave the net Increase of domestic exports $14,200,104 . The British figures show an increase of imports of $35,000,000 , attributable in part to an increase of $15,000,000 worth of cotton , equally divided between Egypt and the United States . The American figures of the balance of trade are not available , but the British debit balance was ? 25,520,400 ? $127 , - 602,000 ? which Is pretty close to a record . The exchange market Is the clearing house where the balance is struck between the international movements of merchandise , which are visible , and the invisible movement of securities , debits upon freight account , Immigrants ' pocket money , and so on . The mere fact that England 's imports are large is not in Itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of the demand for raw material of her industries and the extent of the collection of profits . But this presumption of prosperity is subject to interpretation In the exchange market , and the fact is that the exchanges rule against England with a persistency suggesting that she is not meeting her balances abroad with accustomed ease . The fashionable comment is that England Is troubled , like the United States , by a defective banking system , and that what she needs Is a larger gold reserve . That indeed is necessary , but it would be less necessary if the exchanges were more favorable . Larger credits and smaller debits in the world 's markets is an alternative diagnosis of England 's needs . On the other hand , this Is the corrective of our own strained situation . A seven months ' total of ** of domestic products , with manufactures to be added , is upon an exceptional scale , and explains a volume of bills against London which has been referred to borrowings rather than to collections . We have been described in sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support our speculative excesses . It would have been well for London were it so . An inflated specu- , lation is indeed a menace , but celpted bills payable are another . less appearances are deceptive , rather with the latter than the former that England has now to deal , what , ever speculation there was in our markets having been largely liquidated . And the prospect for the future Is as good as the disclosure of past conditions . There is plenty of cotton left , I and the going price is not prohibitive of sending it . The deficiency in our foodstuffs exports is not due to scarcity nor to lack of demand , but to blockade in deliveries . At Chicago this week there are nearly 5,000 loaded cars impeded in movement to points of export . They will come forward in time , and they leave overflowing elevators behind them , ' not to mention supplies which can not be got Into the elevators . When finally our cotton movement is over , a rush of grain exports is indicated . The release of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation this year is the reverse of last , when the breadstuffs record was made , and the cotton record was swelled rather by price than by quantity . The sharp break in exchange yesterday Is an apparent confirmation of this view .
