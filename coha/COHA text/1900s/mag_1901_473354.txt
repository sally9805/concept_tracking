SOME seventy years ago one of the ablest scientific men of his age , E. H. Weber , began to experiment in his laboratory upon the human skin . He found that on the tip of the forefinger and Bps two fine compass points could be felt as two when they were less than one-twentieth of an inch apart , but if they were nearer they seemed to be one . On the shoulder-blades these points had to he more than an inch , and occasionally nearly two inches , apart before they were recognized as two , and the other parts of the body were between these in sensibility . He also determined by tedious experiments how heavy a bit of pith must be in order to be just felt when it was very gently laid on the skin with forceps , and here too found great differences in different parts of the body . He repeated these experiments at intervals for more than twenty years on many people of different ages , and at last , after writing and rewriting it in Latin and German , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch in 1846 . This perhaps best . marks the beginning of the new psychology , which experiments on the soul , and which has made former knowledge of it definite , and added vastly to it . The skin is the boundary between the self and the external world . The retina , the ear , and all the other senses are infolded skin , and thus touch is the mother-sense of all the rest . We have now applied electricity , heat , and cold , and have an elaborate method of studying the many dermal senses . The following cut shows a device for touching two or more parts of the body simultaneously . ( Fig. 1 . ) The apparatus can be adjusted so that cooled cork pencils touch anywhere when the man blows the bellows . The man in the frame , whose eyes are closed , must touch with a red pencil the points he thinks hit , and the errors show how impossible it is to distribute the attention at the same time all over the body , and very many other instructive facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the natural beginnings of psychology . The skin of the child is only a fraction as extended as that of the adult , but has all the tactile organs , and hence is very sensitive . It requires a volume to describe what has . been discovered here . Taste and smell , the doorkeepers of the body , are experimented on in very many ways in the laboratory . Of all the senses , taste is the only one that grows acute with age . It has many instructive diseases and perversions . Smell is the most delicate of all senses , although it is degenerating in man because sight has largely taken its place . Both these senses require extremely fine manipulation , and have their own intricate apparatus and voluminous literature . The ear was made a centre of psychological interest when Helmholtz discovered that tones could he analyzed and recomposed in the laboratory . This suggested a hitherto unknown complexity of even the simplest sensation , from which a dozen or more over-tones , which could be dissected out , and recomposed , and suggested infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Per-haps all the 14,000 different possible sensations , which Kiilpe estimates , are . no Iess complex . This , too , helped on the idea that the unconscious processes are far more than those that are conscious . A good ear easily distinguishes a fifth , or even far less , of a note in the middle of the scale . Some hear high notes up to perhaps 50,000 vibrations per second , as I found Blind Tom did , whom I once tested in my laboratory at the Johns Hopkins . Adults and children differ vastly in the acuteness of hearing , and many children , thought dull in mind , are only a little deaf . The ear contains also the organs of equilibrium , which give us our sense of giddiness . These are tested by rotations in all planes to measure the amount of disturbed orientation . The following cuts show the experiments needful for making these determinations . In the first ( Fig. 2 ) the subject is rotated horizontally , and in the second ( Fig. 3 ) vertically , and indicates by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points . Sight is in part a study of the retina , which might roughly be called the only part of-the brain that can be seen in function . Each eye nerve has several hundred thousand fibres , and very many curious laws , which can not be explained in brief space , have been found . The following ( Fig. 4 ) is a purely empirical but reduced map of the retina and blind spot of my own right eye at a distance represented by the line at the left . When the eye was constantly fixed at the point of intersection of two straight lines , all the squares seemed the same size and equilateral . The blood vessels can be seen diverging and branching from the blind spot . There are some phenomena , as yet not entirely explained ? e. g. , when we gaze for some time at a waterfall , both sides of the bank near it seem to move slowly up . The following simple apparatus ( Fig. 5 ) gives this effect . By turning the crank , the middle portion moves downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to rise . Another phenomenon hard to explain is seen when any of the following figures are given a rinsing motion , when they all sewn to slowly rotate , or the horizontal lines move in opposite directions . ( Fig. 6 . ) Optical illusions would make another long chapter . The fluid of the eye sometimes contains floating matter which can be seen , but is usually projected against the sky or some other object . Two straight horizontal lines seem slightly curved upward at the ends , and the wondrous eye of the Greeks compensated for this by making the architrave of the Parthenon curve slightly downward . Color and color-blindness open up a field by themselves , as does the study of contrasts , after-images , etc . But the new psychology , which thus began with the senses and insists on an education that opens the eye-gate , ear-gate , etc. , to their fullest extent , has gone far deeper . Some years ago I had to pay nearly eight dollars for a two-leaf paper of Helmholtz , printed in 1S52 , 1110A-curing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Three years before , Du Bois - Reymond had pronounced this impossible , and yet now every laboratory measures with great accuracy the time required for a sensation to move from a finger up the arm to the brain , the time to transform it into a motor impulse , and the rate of the latter down the arm . etc . These " reaction-times " lay bare even the structure of the soul , and show the thoughts we think oftencst . In a public lecture I was giving this demonstration , and said " dog " with a lip-key , and the attendant said the first word that this suggested , which was always " eat , " to another lip-key ; and by eliminating the time of sense and motion we could measure the time required for thought to pass from the idea of dog to that of cat . I said " boy , " and his first and most immediate reaction was " girl " ; but when I said " glass , " instead of " window , " as I expected , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I doubt if one could or would honestly react to a set of normal words I have , which would lay bare the most worn plexus of things he thinks oftenest . Memory has been studied in very many ways and for all ages . This field has its own technique , its own laws of fatigue , and varies with the different senses ; for some are found chiefly ear-minded , others eye-minded , and yet others motor-minded . The early teens seem to be the age when most memory-pictures that abide with us are first impressed . called hither and thither in the body where it is most needed to irrigate cells and tissues , and wash away products of decomposition . Studies of rhythm are now made with a pendulum with various time and.other apparatus like the following . ( Fig. 8 . ) The sentence sense , or the strange carrying power of the mind by which after we begin a sentence like " of man 's first disobedience , " we sustain the tension started by the word " of " through several lines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied , and found to be very important for cadencing the soul . Love , war , and religion seem largely dependent upon rhythm , which is the mother of music and of poetry , as the latter is of prose . Thus beginning with touch , the experimental method has slowly come to include almost every kind of psychic activity . Imagination , sentiment , reason , volition , and all the rest are taken into FIG . I. ? APPARATUS GIVING . WATERFALL EFFECT The study of attention slowly pivoted psychology over to the study of the will . of which the muscles are the organ , and now we are passing to the study of the feelings and instincts , which are so much deeper and larger than the intellect , or even the will . A group of interesting facts now attracting great attention is connected with the changes of blood-pressure which accompany effort and all emotional states . A man lies exactly balanced on knife edges , so that he oscillates freely or in equilibrium . He is then given some problem requiring mental effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tips the end of the balance on which his head rests downward and lifts his feet in the air just in proportion to the effort he makes . Strong emotion or strain even causes the blood to leave the arm or even the finger in a measurable way . The following cut ( Fig. 7 ) shows how we measure the amount of blood called in from two fingers of each hand by intense mental activity . As the fingers shrink , the pen on the rotating drum sinks . The blood is thus being the laboratory , and its instruments and methods have taught us a sharpness and refinement of introspection and self-knowledge which make these methods almost comparable with a microscope for the soul . Thus the so - called old psycho-logy , which taught self - knowledge , is compelled to these methods to reach its own goal , and the forty or fifty laboratories of this country have an ever-widening field and an increasing influence upon our conceptions of the soul . But the new methods are expanding to new fields and making new affiliations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost indispensable adjunct , where all who are to teach these or related topics must learn something of the wondrous new knowledge of localization of brain function , where the speech , eye , ear , and motor centres are , and what is the structure of the neurons and dendrites , more closely connected with thought than any other material in the universe . The brain is the mouth-piece of God , or the absolute in the world , and is perhaps the most highly organized of all ' substances , anatomical or chemical , and the changes which take place in cells are perhaps most rapid here . The fatigued brain cell ? s. g. , at night ? is dark with a ragged nucleus , cloudy with products of decomposition , and always on the way toward neurasthenia and collapse ; but in the normal brain it is cleared out , refreshed , and , as it were , wound up by sleep each night in a way clearly seen under the microscope . Thus sleep is our safeguard against fatigue , in which so many nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must now include some acquaintance with the insane , the blind , the idiots , where Nature has made her sad experiments , of which , however , the expert must carefully study the lesson . Hence we lecture on the chief forms of mental alienation , and demonstrate them in the asylum . Especially suggestive are the border-line phenomena , slightly abnormal , but not yet morbid , with which perhaps every one has some experience in his own person . And to this we must now add hypnotism , which has its own literature and journals . The newest and perhaps richest field for psychology is now opening in the studies of evolution , which are just beginning to be applied to the human soul . Already such progress has been made that the phrases of Herbert Spencer seem almost platitudes , and we are pushing on to know the history of the soul from the dawn of sense in the amoeba up through the rich fields of the study of instincts in the higher animals , the studies of childhood and of primitive or savage man , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special instincts in single species and perhaps individual animals is now in order . The following ( Fig. 9 ) , e. is a rough cut of a Greek wire maze into which rats were let at A to find food at B , and it was found with each successive day that they avoided the blind alleys and reduced their time until , when their education was well advanced , they found their way into a small fraction of the time to the food at the centre . A fish that fed on minnows , when placed in a long trough with a glass separating it from its food it i such a waythat whenever it darted toward a minnow it received a bunt from an invisible object , slowly came to so associate the minnows and the bunt that when the glass was removed it would never touch its natural food . The instinct of migration in fish and birds , which seems to date back to the glacial period , the nesting , toilet-making , food-getting , young-rearing instincts , show a world of mind beneath man vaster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . All this raises the question whether our minds , as we know them , are finalities , or are only stages toward the development of minds as superior to ours as ours are to the animals . Finally , the literature of the new child - study is very slowly but surely giving us a new and more solid basis for education , both as to matter and to method . The child is a very different creature from the adult , and we are only now discovering what childhood really means , and are recognizing its rights in a new way .
