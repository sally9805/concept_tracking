The terminal station of the Long Island Railroad at Long Island City , which was built in 1891 , at a cost of about $200,000 , was destroyed by fire last night . The flames spread so rapidly that within a half hour after the fire had started the station was falling in . The building was a large one , constructed of red brick with a tower on one corner . In the building were the waiting room , and , in galleries , the offices of the company . On the north end were the information office , baggage room , and telegraph office . The ticket office was in the middle of the room in a booth . The fire started in the telegraph office about 8:13 o'clock . The operator had : eft at 8 o'clock . George Leek , the doorman , saw a light in the office which he had seen dark a minute before , and started across the waiting room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior of that room was a mass of flames . He shouted a warning and called to all in the station to get out , but they lingered , not thinking the fire amounted to ? - anythin . From the room where they started , the flames burst into the baggage room and then up a private stairway to the otfice gallery . In hardly more than a minute the whole gallery was a mass of fire , and all in the building made a rush for the street . Before all were out the flames were close on them . The operators in the ' train dispatcher 's office had to leap from a window on the second story . One of them suffered a sprained ank-ie . Nothing was saved from the building except the ticket rack and the cash taken in by the night ticket agent . He carried these out when ne fled . Five minutes after Leek made the disburning , of the fire the entire interior was burning , and the flames were bursting from the windows and roof . An alarm had been turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Vernon Avenue , two blocks away , there was no hope of saving the building . Other alarms were sounded in quick succession , bringing all engines in Long Island City , several from Brooklyn , and later Chief Croker , I with help from Manhattan . The fireboats also helped later . The heat from the fire was intense . Across the street , in Borden Avenue , the heat cracked the plate-glass fronts of the stores and scorched the buildings . The wind was blowing a gale , but fortunately it blew the flames and embers out along the railroad tracks toward Vernon Avenue , the embers being whirled along as far as East Avenue . That prevented the spread of the fire , as there was nothing in the direct line of the danger except some small buildings , in the railroad yards . When the fire started the platforms extending out - from the station were lined with trains of cars made up ready to go out over the various branches . There were engines in plenty in the yard , and as soon as the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , but some of them were scorched and two were destroyed , being hauled out blazing . When the glass in their houses and in the I stores beneath began to crack in the heat the tenants in the houses on the north side of Borden Avenue began taking away their more valuable household goods . When the fire was at its height would-be passengers continued to arrive by way of the ferry from Thirty-fourth Street , but they were advised to recross the river and then by means of the bridge and elevated railroads reach the Flatbush Avenue Station in Brooklyn . The heat was so great that the rails in the yards in Long Island City were twisted double and the ties for a long distance were burned out . It was said by the railroad officials last bight that as much as possible of the traffic would be diverted to Brooklyn this morning- . The trains it would be absolutely necessary to send to Long Island City would have to stop in the freight yards , and the passengers would have to walk to the ferry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned last night . One man was injured by jumping from a window . He was H. F. Woodward , thirty-nine years old ; of 133 Remsen Street , Brooklyn . He was employed in the audit department of the railroad . He is in St. John 's Hospital in Long Island City . After he reached the hospital a message was sent to him by a man named Hammond asking if his . Hammond 's , brother had escaped . Mr. Woodward sent him word that Hammond had leaped before he did and had escaped . As soon as the flames were under control the railroad company cleared its rails in the express yards and began to use this for the arrival and departure of trains . The losses will be heavy . Much will depend upon how many safes in the various offices stood the heat . They are filled with valuable papers . Across Borden Avenue the loss will also be heavy . The loss on plate glass alone sill amount to 810,000 , and this , with the fact that the heat damaged much of the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that end of the loss up to 520.000 . So great was the heat that in a cigar store a hundred feet from the depot and to windward the stock is all dried up and the cases cracked by the heat . The fire was one of the shortest in duration in the memory of old firemen , when the loss is considered . Inside of an hour the fire was practically out . Twenty minutes after it was discovered it was at its height . and the flames were shooting high into the air . Then the dry timbers and trimmings of the depot had burned out and the fire died down almost as suddenly as it burst forth . It was said by an officer of the company late last night that as the construction gangs working on the new improvements near Jamaica reported this morning they would be sent to the station with ties and tracks , and that by noon . or at least before the rush home began in the afternoon , there would be plenty of terminal facilities . Lacking a waiting Morn . heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who arrive before their trains were made up .
