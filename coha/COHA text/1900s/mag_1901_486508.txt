Tuesday 's triumph at the polls in this city could not well have been more complete or more heartening Tammany was smitten hip and thigh . In the face of enormous odds , the decent People of , New York have elected their Mayor , Comp-troller , President of the Board of Aldermen , and three out of five Borough Presidents With peculiar emphasis of delight in political courage , they have , by an extra majority , put in the District Attorney 's office for the next four years the fearless Jerome , undaunted antagonist of crime and of bosses . Never was a fusion ticket more skilfully constructed or more loyally supported City offices for the city 's good was the sufficient watchword of the campaign ; and honest men all through the city and throughout the country are to-day thanking God and taking courage at the magnificent and inspiring results . First among these we reckon the disappearance  --  the final disappearance , we believe  --  of some of the hoary delusions which have lain upon New York like a nightmare That Tammany was invulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that universal suffrage was a failure ; that the boss was a necessity in a vast democracy , that bribery and corruption were too powerful for decency  --  these are but a Sew of - the'bogeys with which despondent spirits have been frightening themselves and terrifying their fellows these many years . But one day 's fall of the ballots ends all that . Tammany had the offices ; it had the police ; it had the prestige of four years of absolute control ; it had the bank accounts of the corporations to draw upon ; every political art and trick in its repertory it brought into play  --  but what did it all avail against the single-minded determination of the reputable classes to sweep away its misrule ? What cuts the Tammany chiefs to the heart , and what should mightily cheer on those who give themselves to the work of reform with a passionate faith in democracy , is the fact that Tammany was repudiated in its own strongholds . ' Those " dangerous classes " on the East Side , those foreign-born voters who could never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketable commodity , and into whose heads it was absurd to expect the notion of civic pride or good government ever to enter  --  they are the electors who most wonderfully responded to the moral appeals of the canvass . Take the Eighth Assembly District as an instance This is Martin Engel 's hunting-ground . It was there that the " red-light " iniquity most abounded ; there that vice flaunted itself most securely , and that crime was boldest ; there , too , that the police were most used in defence of criminals and to the thwarting of justice . But it was also in this district that the University Settlement lifts its beacon ; there that the Citizens ' Union and the Woman 's League sent workers . What do the returns from this Gibraltar of Tammany disclose ? A bare majority for Shepard of 61 votes , where the figures used to run into the hundreds ! We see , then , that even the East Side knows when government becomes too oppressive and too rotten longer to be borne . Those homes of poverty understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety of their children is attacked ; and know how to resent the insolence and the rapacity of Croker and his vile agents , who boast of being able to buy them like cattle To our mind , the returns from the East Side are more eloquent of promise for the future of democracy than was the attitude of those highly educated gentlemen who saw so clearly that Tammany could not be defeated , that they chose the moment of its impending ruin to ally their fortune 's with the unclean thing . The shipping-subsidy lobby at Washington is again filled with horror at the arrival of Western Congressmen who actually want the subsidized vessels to carry freight . This is really a disgusting farm of opposition to the plans of the subsidy schemers . Opponents who object to a subsidy on principle , they can meet in the open , but this insidious attack upon their pet measure by men who say they favor subsidies , but desire to see them bestowed on " freight-carriers , " Is hard to bear quietly . Those representatives from Wisconsin and Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President to say that they were against subsidized " ocean greyhounds , " but should like mighty well to see a bill passed that would help the farmer get his freight to foreign markets  --  what are they but so many snakes in the grass ? Why lug in freight ? That is one of the last things the subsidy beggars think of . Legislation to secure " freight-carriers " is not in the least what they want . Subsidy-carriers are what they are aiming at , and they have a fine assortment of vessels ready to moor alongside the Treasury , and to be laden with subsidy until the hatches . lift - Secretary Gage 's announcement , on Thursday , that he would renew the special offer for redemption of Government bonds , was a natural consequence the previous week 's increase in surplus revenue It will be recalled that the recent offer to redeem in cash other Government binds than those already , covered by the standing policy of the Treasury , was made on September 10 and suspended October 2 The order was issued when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on President McKinley , and it was not revoked until $20,000,000 had been redeemed under its terms , and the money market had shown signs of undoubted ease Some surprise has been expressed at the renewal of the order now , when there is no disturbance in the money market . This questioning Secretary Gage has answered by referring to the October revenue figures , which again show an extremely heavy surplus . The reason why the special offer was withdrawn and then renewed again is that , for several weeks , the Treasury figures seemed to indicate that the increase in the daily surplus , as compared with 1900 , had pretty nearly ceased . Those indications have turned out deceptive . The Government finances during October moved exactly as they had done in the three preceding months . The $4,000,000 deficit of July , 1900 , disappeared wholly in the same month this year . In August , a deficit of $811,000 for 1900 was , replaced this year by a surplus of $6,000,000 . September yielded a $6,100,000 surplus in 1900 , which was increased this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced a surplus of $9,186,000 , as against an excess of only $3,633,000 in October a year ago . It will thus appear that the Government 's surplus is averaging six million dollars per month above that of the preceding fiscal year . That year 's total surpluS was $75,000,000 , at this season 's rate of increase , the fiscal year 1902 would yield a surplus not far below $150,000,000- . The obvious moral of the whole situation is that Congress should take in hand , at once and with definite purpose , the question of revenue reduction . BOth Secretary Gage and President Roosevelt have positive ideas on this subject , which will soon be heard from . ing more than they export . Among the importing countries must also be reckoned England . The showing thus made is , of course , exactly what might have been expected in view of what has been going on during the past few months , and , no doubt , will be taken by the Europeans who have been talking about the " American peril " as a striking corroboration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American manufacturing and of our exports of capital has been coincident with more sedulous exclusion of European goods by higher duties an our side of the ocean , but the main reason for the " unfavorable " conditions on the Continent must be found in the general depression in manufacturing which has prevailed there , and in the growth of industrial combinations in tariff-protected countries . How these Trusts , by their attempt to raise prices , have really opened the market for increased imports of American goods may be seen in the case of coal and manufactures of iron and steel . The remedy for their industrial evils lies in freer conditions of trade , and not in the higher duties recommended as a remedy . The export of nearly $3,000,000 in gold , last Thursday , from New York to Paris , was remarkable chiefly because of the season of the year when it occurred . It does not mean that America 's imports of merchandise from France , or from Europe as a whole , have greatly exceeded exports . As a matter of fact , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought from us , that country and Switzerland being almost the only European ones of which such a statement could be made . But the excess against us , in the case of France , is slight  --  six million dollars for the nine past months ; and in the case of all the European states combined. , our export balance for the period , as reported by the Treasury , has been no less than $447,000,000 . This is the largest excess ever reported . It greatly exceeds the export balance on our European trade , even in the same nine months of 1898 , which were followed by heavy shipments of gold from England and France to us . No better proof than the present situation could be had to show that merchandise trade is not the sole governing force in the movement of international exchange and the international flow of gold . As we have often had occasion to point out , our very large credit balance on merchandise account has been quite offset by the purchase from Europe both of our own and of European securities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through last winter 's costly " deals " in the New York market . The German Emperor 's alleged threat to " smash things " if commercial treaties were not concluded , has roused Senator Cullom to declare that William can not " frighten ' the United States , and that if he wants a tariff war , we will give him as good as he sends . But , bless you , Senator , the Emperor was not speaking of the proposed treaty with the United States , even if he said what is reported . It is Austria and Italy and Russia that he has in mind when he thinks of Germany 's most pressing questions of reciprocal trade . Aside from that , what a queer attitude it is for a country seeking trade , anxious to extend its exports , and searching ' the world over for customers , to be so quick to put the chip on its shoulder and indulge in tall talk about retaliation . It is business that we want , Senator , not a quarrel . The brutal murder of two non-union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of former strikers will ' be a shock to Southerners who have-cherished an inherited pride in. the freedom from labor controversies enjoyed by the South . The men in question belonged to a party which had come from the North to take the places of certain men , employed by the Southern Railway , who had struck work . The apparent quiet of the past few weeks deceived the new men into supposing that the heat of the contest was over , and they had therefore abandoned all precautions against violence . This murder recalls attention to the change that is in progress in the South as a result of the expansion in manufacturing . Labor organizations are rapidly establishing . themselves in many places , and are making efforts to secure shorter hours and more favorable conditions of work . If this were all , the Southern trades-union movement would not differ from that in progress in the Northern States . Recent experience , however , makes it apparent that trades-unionism in the South has some unique characteristics . Labor contests often degenerate , as in the instance at Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which differences are carried much further than elsewhere , and , revenge is visited upon individuals rather than upon groups of men% The strikes that have occurred during the past year in the North have given rise to much violence , and Northern trades-unionists are still certainly far ahead of Southerners in the aggregate amount of disturbance which they have caused . It is not the number , but the peculiar character of these assaults , which resemble nothing else so much as a lynching , that makes the labor situation in the South noteworthy . The Municipal Art League of Chicago is about to put the public spirit of that enterprising city to the test . Nothing less ambitious is proposed than a membership of 500,000 and an annual income of $1,000,000 . Assuming that this sum would be wisely spent , the - embellishment of the city by mural paintings in the public buildings , by sculpture in the parks and open places , by improtement of the ordinary street fittings , would show a marked advance , year by year ; and , with anything like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time might become notable among beautiful cities . Of course , this is on the theory that the plan is practicable . Those who have watched the recruiting of our own two or three , art societies of a popular character , and who know the difficulties of the task , will envy a civic pride which permits a membership of half a million for an art society to be thought of , even as a dream . In a discussion of the Philippine prob- ' lem in the Journal of the Military Service Institution , Major E. J. MeClernand , Military Governor of the District of Cebu , declares that armed resistance to the Americans is sure to appear again in some of the provinces in which it has been suppressed . " It seems , " he says , " too much to expect that outbreaks will not occur for years to come in different parts of the archipelago . It will doubtless be , as it is now , a guerrilla warfare , but experience has demonstrated that this is the most difficult of all wars to terminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow tired of the Philippine problem , thinking to lay it aside as solved and completed . " None the less , Major McClerna , nd believes that in the end mutual benefits will accrue both to the United States and to the Philippines . He finds it necessary to make an earnest appeal for justice , rightly believing that no such rule as ours in the Philippines can possibly succeed unless based upon equity , and he admits the likelihood of arbitrary and cruel acts when an army is scattered , as is ours , in detachments under inexperienced young officers or noncommissioned officers . What Major McClernand fails to see is that a policy primarily founded on injustice can not make itself truly popular with or grateful to the Filipinos until the original wrong is righted . The only way to do this is to turn the islands over to their rightful owners . France seems resolved on pursuing the collection of her claims against Turkey d outrance , and both English and Italian squadrons are witnessing the arrival of a French fleet in the .2Egeari Sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downfall of the traditional British , and one might say European , theory of dealing with the Porte . It was Disraeli who established the theory that the Ottoman Empire must be maintained at all hazards , and his political legatees have stood by his teachings , at fearful cost to the moral feeling of England . To-day the aggressive policy of France rouses no protest , and apparently evokes no fear , while the peaceful annexation of Crete to Greece  --  a most natural consummation , which yet , some five years ag% terrified the Powers in Concert  --  is being accomplished almost without comment . Nor is this changed attitude of Europe due merely to the fact that the British are following the trail of De Wet and Botha too desperately to attend to a less urgent concern . It is certain that the legitimate heir of Beaconsfield has forgotten the paternal doctrine , and that Salisbury would never interfere in the near East except for the defence of Egypt and of the Suez Canal It is doubtful , too , if the Concerted Powers would again stop Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old superstition should be shaken , for one can already see that the time for laisser-faire is passing Conditions in Northern Turkey will soon call for bold and sagacious direction . In the agitation of the Macedonian Committee , in the outrages of unpaid Turkish garrisons , in the consistent campaign of the Albanians against intrusive nationalities , one can not as yet recognize any genuinely national movement . One can not , however , fail to see that the ferment is working , that the concrete disorders have got beyond the power of the Sultan to control , and that the situation must inevitably tend to the erecting of a second line of buffer states or to the intervention of the great Powers . The debates in the French Chamber concerning the best means of overcoming the deficit of 50,000,000 francs continue to raise many important questions of state policy . Disregarding the practical plans proposed by M. Caillaux , the Finance Minister , for raising the funds needed , the Budget Commission has put forward several impossible measures , any one of which , if adopted , would plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the expedients recommended were the suppression of the embassy at the Vatican , the abolition of the Ministry of Public Worship , and the state ownership and operation of the business of refining petroleum . It is needless to say that neither of the first two of these plans , with their far-reaching implications , will be adopted . The really dangerous , scheme is the suggested seizure of the petroleum industry . The proposal apparently grows out of one of the measures recommended by M Caillaux , who advocated , the increase of the excise duty on petroleum . This suggestion was at once taken up and transformed into a plan for placing petroleum on the same footing with tobacco as a Government monopoly . The enormous initial outlay and the elaborate organization which the scheme would necessitate seem to have been wholly ignored by the Budget Commission . Of course , such a measure would require considerable time to become effective , even under the Most favorable circumstances , and to recommend it as a means of immediate relief is absurd . No pains have been spared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an imperial significance . As his tour of the world was primarily a compliment to colonial loyalty , so the colonial representatives were most prominent at his reception Home English and Colonials alike have good reason for congratulation on the completion of the heir apparent 's enterprise . To repeat his father 's triumph of a generation ago would have been impossible . Albert Edward Prince of Wales represented Great Britain at the height of her political influence  --  the arbitress of Europe. , The loyal welcome which the present Duke of York has everywhere received has inevitably been clouded by the uncertainty of the conflict in South Africa , while in the very midst of the rejoicing in the metropolis came news of the misfortune to Col. Benson 's isolated column , fallen upon by a wily and formidable foe , with casualties one-fifth as many as those of Buller 's whole army at the time of his attempt to cross the Tugela , and such a disproportionate loss of officers as recalls the early battles of the war . Even the cold comfort of the reported recovery of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Peace Congress at Glasgow this fall attracted little attention at a time when the wars in the Philippines and South Africa refuse to be ended , the courage of its members in meeting in the land of which Chamberlain is now high priest can not be gainsaid . That there were many reasons for discouragement is , of course , true . Many delegates , for instance , must have shared Baron d'Estournelles de Constant 's disappointment at the treatment which the International Court of Arbitration has received from several nations . This - French authority believes that they see in it a body which may possibly in time grow so as to deprive them of some of their own powers , and thinks that they are deliberately planning to make it innocuous . At the same time , the members of the Congress were able to cite some favorable signs , and one or two significant events have occurred since their meeting . When in Milan recently , the King of Italy sent for the head of the local peace society , who is likewise the editor of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young King expressed his abhorrence of war and of all that war meant , and his hope that international action , as best illustrated in the case of Crete , would more and more tend to terminate peacefully international disputes . In Belgium many women have sent a petition to the Chamber of Deputies pro- ' testing against an armed peace and the resultant taxation which rests so heavily upon the poor . They protested also against the drunkenness and vice which result from life in barracks . Their example is one which might well be followed by women , the world over . To be holier than the Pope is usually to be ridiculous , and many will feel that the German censorship , in suppressing on religious grounds a work which the Greek Church allows to circulate in Russia , has shown an excess of zeal . Of course , censorship is not compatible with a fully developed sense of humor , but it would seem that , when the church which excommunicated Tolstoy allows his apologia , The Meaning of My Life , ' to pass unhindered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerance . Perhaps they would if the book were submitted to them directly , and the censor 's solicitude may merely show that curious exacerbation of the olfactory sense which sniffs an offence where none is intended . Certain little-known features of Papal finance are discussed in a recent number of that excellent Milanese journal La Perseveranza . It appears that , at a time when the old Papal nobility were deeply involved in the real-estate speculations which ruined half the princely families , the Vatican was a frequent lender upon the security of real estate . By foreclosure it became a large property-owner in the part of the city beyond the Tiber , which , according to Papal theory , was still a possession of the Church . Gradually this banking function of the Vatican became more extended . The consolidation of the debts of one embarrassed family required a loan of six million lire ( $1,200,000 , roughly ) . Operations of this extent soon led to complications with the Italian Government , which the Vatican has never consented to recognize . In order to liquidate his affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sold his valuable art collections to the state , directing the transfer of the money to the Vatican . For some time the payment was held up , because the Vatican could receive no funds from , or even conduct negotiations of any kind with , the de facto Government . The intervention of a trust company made the transfer possible. - Just what the effect of this policy upon the finances has been , no one but the Papal authorities could say . In any case , these incidents cast an interesting side-light upon certain conditions of the maintenance of a Papal party in the enemy 's country .
