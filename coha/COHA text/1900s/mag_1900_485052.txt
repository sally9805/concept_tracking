The official Monthly Summary of Commerce and Finance Of the United &hies; naturally , under present conditions of our empire , turns the official search-light upon our expanding commerce with Oceanica . For the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1900 , our exports to Oceanica have been 45 per cent . greater than they were for the year ending in 1899 Our trade with Hawaii and the Philippines has been increasing rapidly , and furnishing an " expanding market for American goods . " There are some items in this growing trade with our new dependencies in the Or'i'ent which are of considerable significance . The largestamount of goods exported from the United States to the Philippine Islands during any one year up to the outbreak of hostilities was for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1896. when our total exports amounted to $162,466 This was considerably above the average . In 1892 our exports to these islands had amounted to but $60,914 . In 1897 they were only $94,597 , and the next year but $127,804 . Up to this time our export trade increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no marked tendency either to expand or to contract permanently . But , marvellous to state , during the war period this trade of ours has flourished wonderfully , mounting up to $404,193 in the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1899 , and to more than two and one-half millions during the year ending with last June . Such a rapid expansion of trade is well calculated to arouse official pride and unofficial suspicion . Obviously it is a rate of growth which will , if continued , in a very few years , perhaps two or three , bring our Philippine trade up to a level with that which we have with a first-class European Power . A glance at the articles entering into this promising trade , however , does much to dispel any illusions of this sort . By far the largest single item in it is " malt liquors , " $563,950 . The . exportation of malt liquors last year exceeded our total exports in the year preceding by more than $150,000 , and was in amount four or five times our average total export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " spirits distilled , " $150,252 , which itself alone again exceeds our average ante-bellum trade . There were , of course , small items of a kindred sort , such as wine , $8,397 , and tobacco , $12,493. - How much of our two and one-half millions of exports , which is not represented in our soldiers ' bills for beer and whiskey , and in their officers ' bills for wine , represents other " war supplies , " can not be accurately determined . The next largest item after beer is " all other animals " ( except cattle ) , $441,950 . Now , apparently all other animals except cattle are horses and mules , for there have been exactly $441,950 worth of horses and mules exported from the United States to the Philippines during this fiscal year . The next largest item is for " iron and steel and manufactures-of iron and steel , " $383,892 . This item is somewhat baffling , owing to the fact that $259,937 out of the total amount represents manufactures of iron and steel , machinery , machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The next largest item is breadstuffs , $168,726 , of which $126,553 stands for 327,741 bushels of oats exported . This is a new trade , indeed . There were no oats at all exported to the Philippines in the month of July , 1899 The first large exportation of oats came in November , 1899 , $60,092 , shortly after the great export trade in horses and mules sprang up . The next largest item , hay , is of the same character . No hay went inJuly , 1899 , but in July , 1900 , our exports of hay amounted to $23,434 . Taken all together , our export trade with the Philippines has " expanded " in two years from $127,804 ? a normal amount when contrasted with earlier years  --  to . $2,640,449 It is not necessary to point out , however , in view of the above figures , that this increase is an abnormal growth , and that when our army is withdrawn , if it ever is withdrawn , our " expanding trade in the Orient " will suffer a killing blight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the great excess of imports into the United States from the islands over exports to them This is clearly shown in the following table of imports and exports : TABLE Of the $5,971,208 worth of imports into the United States last year from the Philippines , $5,014,770 is designated under the single heading " vegetable fibres . " There are , in fact , only two other items in our imports , sugar , $925,335 , and tobacco , $1,068 . These products are all agricultural , and are produced almost entirely by cheap imparted Chinese or native labor . There are no opportunities for investment of any considerable amount of capital except in land suited for the production of these chief exports . The conclusion is simple and obvious . It is that the only certain way of insuring a continuance of that rapid growth in our trade with Oceanica which the Administration in Washington notes with pride in its official report , will be to ship more troops to the Philippines . That will stimulate the export of beer , and incidentally of other commodities , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army to protect it , and more beer and incidentals for the larger army ad inftnitunt . It is a novel and withal a costly way of inflating our foreign commerce  --  but what would the islands be worth without commerce ? If the islanders themselves do not want our goods , we must send an army with an appetite for American drinks and incidentals , and then ship stuffs to satisfy that appetite . Incidentally , that will encourage our shipping as well as our breweries . The wonder is that our Government has delayed so long in adopting so simple an expedient for insuring to the United States a dominating and , if we may trust our war news , a lasting commercial supremacy in the Philippines . THE BANKERS AT RICHMOND . Ex-Senator Hill 's remark , in his Elmira speech of September 25 , that " the situation of the currency of the country , " after the passage of the new finance bill , " was left substantially as it was before any such bill was enacted , " is reinforced by similar statements in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention of the American Bankers ' Association in Richmond uniformly touched on the lack of adequate protection for the gold standard under the aet of March 14 , and on the danger of intrusting to a hostile Executive the administration of that law . The act , as described by the President of the Association , " does not secure " the gold standard " against the policy of a President or Secretary of the Treasury hostile to gold . " " It is an . open secret , " said the President of the Richmond Clearinghouse , " that we are no more committed to a gold basis now than before the passage of the act . " Both speakers plainly pointed out the responsibility of the Senate for this lack of proper safeguards . Their statements seem to have commanded the assent of the large and important body of bankers gathered in the convention , and they are substantially correct . That they are correct , reflects little credit on the Senate which , with an Administration majority , deliberately emasculated a House bill which would have provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out the unquestionable danger of committing to a chronic agitator against the gold standard the administration of this law . The inadequacy of the so-called Gold Standard Act , which was first exposed by Professor Laughlin in the Journal of Political Economy , is now well understood by all persons who are capable of understanding the monetary discussions of the past twenty-five or thirty years . President Hill of the Bankers ' Association at Richmond added to Professor Laughlin 's paper a true statement of the obstacles which this defective measure puts in the way of our international trade . It is a fact , well known to bankers and to importers and exporters , that England has an advantage over all other countries as a centre of the world 's exchanges by reason of the invariableness of her standard of value . Money from all parts of the world is deposited there because the depositors know exactly what they will receive when they draw for it . They know that it will be gold of a certain standard . They do not know this of any other country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In France and Germany the banks have the right to pay in silver , and sometimes they exercise this right , putting the depositor to the inconvenience of selling the silver coin to brokers , or of paying a premium to the banks for gold . Consequently , when a foreign depositor makes his choice of a place of deposit for idle funds , he chooses London rather than Paris or Berlin . Although the chance of his being required to accept silver in Paris or Berlin is slight , and although the premium on gold in such a case is slight , he prefers not to run any risk , and helknows , too , that in case of a war between those countries the gold premium might rise disastrously . It follows that England has an advantage in international trade by reason of the fixedness of her standard . Her bankers get the handling of the world 's exchanges , and reap the commissions which are paid therefor . Mr. Hill , in the Richmond Convention , drew attention to this feature of our international trade , saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their countries , commerce , and laws , if we are to dominate their trade and be their bankers . To do these things we need a currency of stable value No one will buy drafts on us or deposit their money with us if these drafts and their credits represent doubtful and changing values , while a competitor nation offers a currency which does not shrink and is measured at all times by an unchanging standard . It is no answer to say that payment in gold . if that is the standard desired , can be secured by private contract . The very fact that it requires a special contract to secure it is a declaration that the general law does not afford the protection desired . " It is true that our Treasury has never failed to pay gold for any valid claim payable in collars , but it is true also that we have been very near paying in silver several times since specie Payments were resumed in 1879 , and that great disturbance was caused thereby . All the turmoil and confusion of the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid heavily for its toying with silver in the Bland-Allison Act and in the Sherman Act , and it is not impossible that it may have to pay the same penalty again . ? It depends on circumstances whether we shall or shall not have to face the crisis hereafter . Bad crops , slack business , and a les , sened demand for currency for retail trade , which now absorbs the silver cer tificates , would certainly turn this kind of money into the public Treasury , and might , as it has done before , compel the Secretary to resort to he s utmost legal powers- to avert a panic and crisis . In this event it would be vastly important to have a Secretary of the Treasury who would use those powers to the end of maintaining the gold standard . The perception of this truth , which is making its way slowly but surely through business circles in all parts of the country , is undermining Mr. Bryan . With the increasing public sense of the real nature of the situation , Mr. Bryan will hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this regard when he begins his Eastern stumping tour . The candidate had nothing to say on the issue in accepting the Democratic nomination ; but he was frank enough with the Populists , even to the extent of hinting at what might be done for the greenback circulation . Surely the people of New York have a right to hear something from him on the subject . IMPERIALISM IN JAPAN . The news fromaJapan that the Yamagata Ministry has resigned , and that the Mikado has appointed Marquis Ito Premier to form a new Cabinet , is of worldwide interest . The reason for recalling this statesman from his retirement , as frankly stated by the Emperor himself , is that affairs in China are entering upon the diplomatic stage , and that the guidance of Japan 's interests in the settlement must be intrusted to competent and skilled hands . The Marquis is not only the most accomplished statesman of the Orient , and easily a match , in his grasp of the problems involved , for any representative of a European Power whom he may encounter , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike of the Mikado , of all the principal political parties in his country , and of the nation at large . The occasion suggests an inquiry as to the intent of the Japanese Government , and of the nation which it well represents , respecting the great questions at issue in the Far East . Such an investigation is not easy , and the problem may seem almost insoluble to one who is not acquainted with the mental constitution and habits of the Japanese . For there are wheels within wheels , currents and cross-currents , main issues and side issues , and issues seemingly subordinate and yet really powerful in Japanese politics ; and the changes in the direction of the resultant of all these forces are often bewilderingly rapid and surprising to the outside observer . There exist , however , in Japan , - deep and strong currents of opinion which dominate all the other drifts of sentiment and streams , of influence . It is these which are determining the larger destiny of this interesting and gifted peo pie , and which , when two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment of the forces represented by both as shall carry with it the sentiments and endeavors of the whole nation . Before the changes introduced through the war with China , such currants had been set in motion by the question of Imperialism internally considered  --  that is , as an affair of the government of the Japanese people within their own empire . Shall the Constitution , which was theoretically the gracious gift of his Majesty to his subjects , be practically interpreted according to the German type of monarchy , or according to the English ? More particularly , Shall the Ministry be unqualifiedly responsible to the Emperor , as his creation ; or shall it , at least in some respects and in some clearly recognized fashion , be responsible to the people , acting through their hereditary or selected representatives ? Formerly the practical solution of this question determined largely  --  perhaps chiefly  --  the forming and the dissolution of Parliament , and the making and the breaking of alliances among the different political parties . Of late , however , this has been overshadowed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the maintenance , but also the extension , of the influence of the nation abroad . How shall Japan assert and maintain- its claim to be considered a first-class and a growing empire among the other Powers operating in the Eastern world ? To understand the problem before the Japanese Government under the premiership of Marquis Ito , something must be known regarding the present condition and relations of the great political parties . There are three of them , no one of which has the numbers or strength to stand alone , and their relations are such that the Government must always be supported by two of the three to carry its measures . Under the Yamagata Ministry , two of these parties were united in the general policy of making Japan strong in its army and navy , in order that it might the more successfully pursue an Imperialistic policy in its relations with foreign nations . The other party , the Liberal , whose leader has been Count Okuma , and which stands rather for moderation in military expanses and internal development , has for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do his utmost to secure the legitimate fruits of the recent expensive efforts of the Japanese Government to extend the power of the empire , while he notoriously defends the more pronounced Imperialistic method of interpreting the Constitution for purposes of internal control and development . What , then , has the world to expect ,  - -  if not to fear , from this strengthening of Imperialism by the entrance of Japan into the ranks of the nations that are of the first class for purposes of foreign influence , or even of dominatiOn and conquest ? Certain Paris papers have tried to excite the fears of their readers  --  presumably in. the interest of Russia  --  by vividly picturing the results which will follow when , with China civilized and armed with modern weapons , Japan shall lead the combined yellow hosts to overrun again the domains of Asia and of Europe . Nothing could be more absurd . Japan is no more likely to take the lead of a modernized China m any such direction than is England , having first of all armed and drilled the millions of India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To understand the real purposes of the guiding minds among the Japanese governing classes , even of those who support the policy of Imperialism , one must have a more sympathetic , appreciative , and just insight into the peculiarities of Japanese character . The spirit and aim with which these leaders undertook the war with China furnishes an illustration in point . It was their contention that the Japanese had no hatred of China , and no wish to conquer and overrun China simply for the sake of enlarging their own empire ; that they only wished China to be awakened and prepared , by the adoption of modern methods and resources , to join Japan in preventing the Oriental races , with their characteristic civilization , from being dominated , overrun , and eventually extinguished by the Occidental . Their effort , if we take their word for it , was directed toward both the self-preservation of Japan and the improvement of China ; in other words , it was at once self-interested and benevo , lent . Sentimental , and even intrinsically improbable , such claims will seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the fact that they were seriously put forth is of the first importance in any analysis of the Japanese character and of the situation in the East to-day . Moreover , the theory will not be discredited in wholesale fashion by any one who has sympathetic and intelligent knowledge of the Japanese . Nor do the excesses which weie connected with the attempt to carry out this ostensibly beneficent design by any means so much discredit its sincerity as does the atrocious conduct , in certain instances , of our own troops in the Philippine Islands , or of the British troops in South Africa , impugn the sincerity of the claims of their Governments . Indeed , what can be said by the United States , or by England , against the Japanese form of Imperialism , as Marquis Ito , supported by the Emperor , by the parties now in the majority , and by the whole body of the people , will no doubt endeavor to carry it out ? If the Anglo-Saxon race may properly seek to dominate the world , why may not the races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop themselves so that they may become secure against such domination ; and why may they not adopt such measures as they maintain are best calculated to bring about a result which seems to them in the best interest of the human race ? POLITICAL TENACITY . There is no question that , when you have two candidates in the field neither of whom you consider fit for the Presidency , the natural , human , business-like thing to do is to choose some one else The assertion that no one else is possible , and that if you do n't like Bryan , for instance , you must have McKinley , and that if you do n't like McKinley , you must have Bryan , is such an awful confession of the failure of the democratic system that but few men should like to make it . And yet it is what a great many decent supporters of McKinley say . I was talking to one the other day who furnished a terrible list of objections to McKinley and an equally strong list of objections to Bryan . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good business man , that he would vote for neither of them . But , to my astonishment , he announced to me that , in spite of all these reasons , he was going to vote for McKinley . I was amused by this , because the reasons given against the selection of Bryan were exactly like those given against the selection of McKinley four years ago Within those four years , however , the objections to McKinley have gained strength , because he has shown in actual practice what kind of President he makes The objections to Bryan , on the other hand , still remain possibilities , or presumptions . He will not have an opportunity to catch up with McKinley in " unfitness " without getting into the Presidential chair At present , Bryan 's unfitness is 2 ? 1 , posse , while McKinley 's is is case My friend , who is a man who has played a leading part in the world in his day , gave me , as what seemed a ludicrous reason for not attempting to do anything else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am concerned in this matter not so much for the triumph of either candidate as for the preservation of the national reputation for rationality as well as humor One of the virtues of democracy hitherto has been supposed to be the capacity for choosing good candidates for its highest offices , if it so pleases But there is not , even in an hereditary monarchy , a more absurd provision than that , if you can not choose a candidate whom you acknowledge to be very bad , you must choose one who is also bad , but not quite so bad . The introduction of such a view into the management of the affairs of a private business concern would be a very direct admission , in the eyes of the world , that the concern was near its end . I have not seen , as yet , an out-and-out defence of McKinley 's career by anybody who thoroughly approved of his policy , except by extremists like Roosevelt or Beveridge . What McKinley 's defenders say , as far as my knowledge goes , is that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody else  --  a very comical impasse for a great people . During the McKinley canvass , four , years ago , I received a visit from a German publicist , then on a visit to this country . He had just been passing two hours with McKinley at his home in Canton . I asked him what impression McKinley had made on him . The impression , he said , of the young man who , being asked whether , he played the piano , replied that " he did not know , for he had never tried " The answer to this which McKinley 's friends make for him , is that no matter how many bad things he has done , stocks will fall 50 per cent if he is not elected again . I confess I do not greatly care which is elected , so sure am I that things will go on under Bryan , if it be Bryan , very much as they go on under McKinley to-day . I think the people will put up with from Bryan very much what they put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed a class of faults unknown to former Presidents. , He has disregarded the Constitution by annexing foreign provinces without the authority of law He has employed 65,000 Americans to massacre foreigners who had done him no injury , and to destroy their homes He has declared war , without notice , upon a fiiendly people , to whom he had first promised peace and cooperation He has allowed his subordinate officers to denounce the organic law which created them , as worn-out and of no effect He has , in fact , done all the things which usually precede a coup d'Otat , whether under Julius Cnsar or Louis Napoleon , and , what is unheard of in history , he has secured a Congress in connivance with him I consider any man who has not done these things as more fit for the Presidency than McKinley , even if that other man were considered capable of doing them To tell me that such a man as McKinley is fit for the Presidency because his non-election will cause a fall of stocks , strikes me as ludicrous This might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for a broker only Among free and self-governing people it ought to excite a smile It is the old argument by which Napoleon the Third justified his coup d ' ? tat . What he said was , that he must be Emperor , must kill those who opposed him , and must put an end to the Republic , or stocks would fall heavily . This is exactly the McKinley argument There is not one unconstitutional act committed by McKinley , the omission of which would have imperilled the happiness of a single American citizen If he had court-martialled Otis and Merritt , who have been abusing the Constitution and justifying his own violation of it , it would , have secured us the respect of foreign nations , and continued the stability of our power , without the loss of a single life The permission accorded to his military officers to decry the form of government to which they owe their existence , strikes me as one of the silliest things in his career The proposal to give a man who is elected to the highest office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will obey the Constitution and when he will not , to annex provinces when he pleases by simple proclamation , and to make treaties of peace through his creatures , seems to me one of the craziest propositions in history . To decide upon the propriety of this , one does not need to prefer either McKinley or Bryan Great nations do not compose their state papers while hanging over a stockexchange ticker . E. L. G.
