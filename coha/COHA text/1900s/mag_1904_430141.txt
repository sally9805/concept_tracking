 | LIKE one of its own great ships as , answering to the thrust of her powerful propellers , she pushes steadily onward , laying back knot after knot of her voyage , has been the progress of the navy ? in all that leads to improvement in efficiency of material and personnel ? ever since the four ships of Admiral Walker 's " White Squadron " first shoved their noses out to sea one gusty , windy December morning now some fifteen years ago . Tall masts and wide-reaching spars with great squares of canvas , bellying to the wind and blackened with the smoke of the fires below , still rose from the steel hulls of these ships . The hum and buzz of electric crane and winch had not yet displaced the creaking of yard and block , or the measured thud of feet upon the deck and the merry squeal and rattle of fife and drum , as sailormen , marines , idlers , all tailed on to the falls , and the boats were run up to the davits ; and in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their white sides , and many radical changes in gear and equipment , there was much remaining to remind one of " the days of heave and haul , Of the weather-gage , of tack and sheet , When the anchor rose to the tap of feet And the click of the capstan pawl . " And yet , though these vessels ? or , like one ancient graybeard of a boatswain 's mate sarcastically put it , as he glanced around decks cumbered , in his bewildered mind , with newfangled devices and machinery like a factory ashore , " These here blankety-blanked iron coal-stoves wot they calls ships " ? were but the prototypes of the tremendous sea-machines to come , to many an old shellback among their crews the knell of all true seamanship tolled out with every stroke of the ship 's bells . But while it is true that the mariner is no longer dependent upon his skill and ability to handle and move his ship by means of a force of nature he can not control , and though human ingenuity has given him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fire , and the lightning , enabling it to come and go by day or night wherever there is water enough under the keel to float it , the sea ever remains the same , and the domination over its mighty power will always be the problem of him who goes down to it . The same stoutness of heart , the same quickness of brain , the same skill in reading current and tide , the  | same resourceful readiness under all conditions of wind and wave , fog , storm , or battle , that have so conspicuously marked the achievements of the American naval seaman of the past must to-day meet tests of seamanship as rigid in their requirements as ever before . All of the ship 's company ? machinist , fireman , or coal-passer down where the engines throb and thrust ; yeoman , steward , and messman in the narrow ammunitionpassages below ; marine in military top and battery ; every soul on board , each in his way ? form the units of the fighting whole ; all must face alike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of battle . But it is on the trained skill of the seaman ? he who mans the ship 's weapons on gun-deck , in turret and torpedo-room ; who manages and navigates , directs and controls every movement of his craft , battleship or cruiser , torpedo-boat or submarine ? that mainly depend the triumph of victory , the safety and security of vessel and crew . Quick , ready , and resourceful as was the nimble topman and the tarry-handed , curved-fingered hauler of sheet and bowline , another " handy man , " equally adroit , expert , and efficient , but with complicated duties requiring education and training such as his forebears never dreamed of , succeeds them in the person of the blue-jacket ? seaman and artificer ? of the times in which we live . While on almost any of the big ships may still be found some sturdy survivors of the old navy , ? some level-headed , oaken-hearted master-at-arms ; some hardfisted , sea-worn chief quartermaster ; some canny , handy gunner 's or carpenter 's mate , for , anomalous as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands full of work even on the newest of steel ships , ? the youth of the great mass of @#  | the crews is apparent even to the casual visitor ; and while some of the disadvantages of youth may be evident in our young man-of-war's-man , take him by and large , he is an excellent product of the conditions of naval life of the present day . The youthful blue-jacket may seem , at times , a trifle too self-confident , too prone to believe he " knows it all , " but that is because he has an active brain and nimble wit ; and though , like most young Americans of his class , he has been accustomed to restraint of but a mild nature before entering the service , a comparatively short experience on shipboard will usually teach him the wisdom of holding his tongue and attending strictly to what he is told to do by those to whom the law gives authority over him . Yet , while punishment , swift and sure , follows offenses , the discipline of the navy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incumbent on all grades from the commander-in-chief to the last enlisted landsman . No commanding officer may refuse " to receive and consider any request , report , or statement that any member of the crew may desire to make , " and the rights of the subordinate , no matter how humble his position , are as safely guarded as the privileges of the highest in command . As a rule most good-natured , our sailorlad is not wanting in the combativeness of his race ? not a bad quality in a man the ultimate object of whose being is to fight in defense of the rights and interests of the country , provided it be properly controlled ; and discipline takes care of that . Human nature on shipboard is very much like human nature in other places ; so in ship 's companies , numbering anywhere from one hundred to seven hundred men , occasional disputes and contentions are bound to occur . To the credit of the great majority , however , there is much " give and take " in the intimate proximity of ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a selfish , quarrelsome , or dirty shipmate is soon made to realize the unpopularity of his ways . Cleanliness of ship and person is a sort of fetish in the navy . Scrubbing , polishing , and painting seem to be going on somewhere on board almost all the time , and your thorough man-of-war's-man himself is more often than otherwise a model of neatness in person and dress . You may see the bulge of a quid in his cheek , but tooth-brush and powder come out of his ditty-box ? the little wooden chest where he keeps his most cherished belongings ? night and morning , and he washes and scrubs his lithe , muscular body until the tattoo-marks stand out in clear red and blue against a white skin as fine as silk . It is " clean dirt " ? only coal-dust and oil ? that besmirches face and clothing of the grimy , perspiring fireman , as at the end of his watch he makes his way to the shower-baths provided for his use alone on board the larger vessels . Nothing seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the water running from the hose over the decks in the daily " washing-down " and holy-stoning of the morning watch ; and when the periodical task of coaling ship ? that most trying of all duties to both officers and men , for all hands , whether from ward-room or forecastle , must remain on board during the operation ? is over , some scores of brawny fellows , naked as the day they were born , stand or move about behind the shelter of the high bulwarks on the superstructure deck , soapsuds and lather up to their eyes , playing the hose on one another , capering about with chaff and laughter like so many boys just set free from school . Although , with clue-garnets and stu'n ' - sails , much of the picturesque language of the sea has passed away , Jack 's conversation is still garnished with expressions and terms born of the conditions of his life on the ocean . His language with his mates is a curious combination of Bowery slang and sea-phrases , ? " Youse guys come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I heard one young cockswain order , ? and I believe that if Shakspere could have known our modern Yankee man-of-war's-man , he never would have put strange oaths in the mouth of a soldier . Yet in spite of the peculiarities of his speech and his almost universal neglect of the rule that two negatives make an affirmative , he can send or read the most complicated message in either the international or naval code ? with signal-flags in the daytime , or by the Ardois system of red and white electric lights at night , through which our war-ships hold conversations with one another ? as intelligently and correctly as the most  | skilful telegrapher can tick one off on his instrument . Knowledge in the care and use of the often complicated , sometimes even delicate , mechanical devices by the aid of which much of his work is done frequently calls for the exercise of a high order of intelligence on the part of the blue-jacketartificer or seaman or gunner . Chat with the smooth-shaven , earnest-eyed electrician in the intervals of the search-light drill ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical store-room ' way down between decks , and talk with him about his work , the chances are that he will reach up to some shelf and bring forth plans , or blue prints , or some book or other to help him explain . In his ' prentice days he has been taught to hand , reef , and steer , and he can handle an oar in a boat , and a rifle or revolver , too , if called on , and all he has learned about electricity he has learned in the service . Or come for a smoke with my friend the gunner 's mate , in the turret where the big guns are , and where the thick white , curving sides of steel are as spotless and clean as the walls of a fine lady 's drawingroom . He loves his great guns , and is eternally pottering about them , polishing here or touching up a spot on the paint on the mounts there . He can tell you all about what they can do , these grim pets of his ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one gunner 's mate who designates his big thirteen-inch fellows as Protector and Defender ; he has ideas , that honest sailorman , and will discourse learnedly about initial velocity , resisting power , and the like . Though he is rather shy with strangers , if you know him well he may bring out some of his sketches , for he has a crude , natural handiness with his pencil , and produces wonderful pictures of ships with every bolt and rivet carefully defined ; or he may show you photographs of ship life , or scenes in the ports he has visited , which he has taken and developed and printed himself . He is a great reader , too , in the intervals of fussing with his guns : likes Dickens , and can quote line after line from Shakspere 's plays ; nevertheless , when he goes ashore on liberty he lays a straight course for the " vawdvill shows , " as he calls these popular places of entertainment . But to see him at his best is when , the ship cleared for action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is just room for you to stand in the narrow passage between the two great cannon ; you are shut in tight in the thick-walled turret , together with a dozen or more men of the guns ' crews standing , naked to the waist , silently at their stations . The battle-lanterns are burning , and a few diffused rays of daylight shine dimly in through the oval openings of the gun-ports . You can feel the massive turret moving slowly and smoothly , but you can see nothing outside . An order from the quiet-voiced officer in command , and instantly everything springs into action . Out of the depths of the ship , rising through the circular shaft which , curving like the inner walls of the tower of a lighthouse , leads to the ammunitionpassages and magazines below , a metallic rumbling sounds up from where the huge shells and great powder-cartridges are being loaded on the electric ammunitionhoists . Up come the cars , quickly and quietly , until the projectile points into the gun 's breech thrown open to receive it . With smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly home . A clang , and the breech-block closes ; a pressure of an electric stud , and the piece is discharged , settling back on its carriage from the recoil of the explosion of nearly three hundred pounds of powder t as gently and lightly , seemingly , as the fall of a feather . You do not feel much of the tearing displacement of the air outside , the " blast " of the gun ; the ponderous steel walls of the turret have in a measure protected you from the tremendous rush of air into the vacuum created by the explosion , and only a heavy , bursting thud strikes your ears , which , however , if you have neglected a little cotton for them , may produce surprising sensations . Some vapor seeps through the interstices between the gun tubes and the sides of the ports , and the powder gases make you choke and gasp a little , but , except for the heated and confined atmosphere of the steel box in which you are closed up , you do not f eel much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is no  | confusion , no hurry , though the turret is alive with quick-moving forms as the welldrilled men spring to and from their various posts , and the rush of the ammunitioncars , the smooth movement of the guns and turret , the thrusting of telescopic rammer go on with the regularity and swing of a well-controlled engine . Notwithstanding the radical changes in duties and education , and though mechanical equipment and the milder but equally effective methods of training and discipline have brought about such marked contrasts with those of bygone days in his environment , Jack has always remained Jack . " The burden of the mystery of the sea " is his , and the strange , fascinating influence of traditions and customs handed down through generation after generation of farers of the ocean still holds sway over him , and marks him as one apart from his fellow-men ashore . Alike simple and shrewd , manly and self-reliant , and yet at times unreasoning , dependent , and confiding as a child , his is a strange and complex character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand . Haunting sea superstitions sometimes complicate , but never daunt , a courage and bravery daring and reckless to a degree , while his careless disregard as to what the future may bring and his extravagant free-handedness with his money are proverbial . " Put some of it in a savings-bank ? Not on your life ! There ai n't no one dependent on me , " once said one of my friends before the mast to me . " Why , look-a here ; you r'member that old German-Swede , Blank ? Do n't you know , sir , he was quarter-gunner on this ship time you made the cruise in the Mediterranean with us . Well , he was the savin ' kind : so close and  | mean he was a byword with all hands . Wot happened ! He had n't taken his discharge two weeks when he went to the hospital , and when he come out , he come out feet first . Wot good did all his savin ' do him ? What fun does such fellows have out o ' life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blow in every cent -- and a butterfly dude wo n't be in it with me ! " My sailor friend was a splendid type of the minor petty officer of the new navy , tall and spare in flesh , but solid in bone and muscle , with a thick mustache twisted and turned upward at the ends . A great dandy , his uniforms , blue or white , were always clean and fresh and cut in as exaggerated a sea-fashion as his officers could permit with due regard to the regulations ; he had a fad of wearing long black silk stockings and patent-leather pumps when he went ashore on liberty : but in spite of his harmless frills , no better boatswain 's mate ever piped all hands to muster . We had been shipmates before on more than one short cruise it had been my privilege to make , and were well acquainted . He had been telling me that his term of enlistment had nearly expired , and that a very respectable sum ? several hundreds of dollars ? had accumulated to his credit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing Broadway , I almost came in collision with a man who , in his brand-new clothes , shining high hat , and silver-topped cane , looked as if cut out from one of the fashion-plates you see hanging on the walls of your tailor 's shop , and it was not until my finger-bones were almost crushed in the clasp of a great redgloved hand that I recognized the smiling gray eyes and upturned mustache of my friend the whilom boatswain 's mate . Oh , yes , he reenlisted within the three months , and no doubt is now doing his duty in some quarter of the globe as faithfully and cheerfully as always , laying his pay aside until the time comes for another run ashore in his character of gentleman of leisure . There is nothing new under the sun . Shade of Marryat ! do we not all remember Mr. Chucks , the boatswain in " Peter Simple " ? Like human beings , ships have their peculiar characteristics . Those who command and man them must learn their ways ; must make allowance for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their effective potency and strength . They must know to a hair's-breadth just what answer helm and screw will give under all the varying phases of sea and wave ; how to regulate and control the vessel 's speed whether going ahead , astern , or turning in her circle . Where in the rapidly following movements of a manoeuver in squadron the great battle-ships , rushing through the water at a speed of from twelve to fifteen knots with others ahead or astern or on either quarter , turn or advance , wheel in column or in line in answer to the hoists of gaudily colored flags , streaming from the signal-yard of the flag-ship by day , or the bright-winking gleams of her signal-lamps by night , the dire disaster of collision is possible if eye and ear and trained mind are not always alert . It is not out of mere routine that , day in and day out , on every fighting-ship in the navy , the warning shriek of the siren-whistle sounds the call for collision-drill and the closing of water-tight doors all through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often suddenly drifts over the waters of the North Atlantic coast , nine ships of Admiral Bunce 's squadron were steaming to the eastward . For twenty-four hours the heavy masses of vapor entirely shut out the view of one ship from another ; all night and all day the dismal wails of the whistles of the ships sounded , one after another , all down the line , counting out their distinguishing numbers , or answering to the orders blown to them through the mist from the flag-ship . No observation of the sun could be had , and position and course of the squadron were determined and held by dead-reckoning , yet , though during the whole time not a ship caught as much as a glimpse of its squadron mates , when the fog lifted , as quickly as it had shut down , every vessel was in position in the column stretching its length over the sea back from the flag-ship . There was nothing extraordinary in this ; it is mentioned here simply as an incident of seamanly skill in handling and navigating , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties of which could be successfully confronted and overcome only by those schooled and educated to the sea . The forces of his engines have mitigated  | the perils of a lee shore , but in the very power and strength of the ship itself may some time lie the cause of sudden unforeseen danger , calling forth , to the utmost extent of strain , the exercise of all the trained courage and skill of the seaman . In the " Toilers of the Sea " we read the story of the gun breaking from its lashings and running amuck on the deck of the ship until caught and subdued by the master seaman of Hugo 's tale . I think it was in 1896 , in a great storm off Hatteras , ? but time and place are immaterial , ? that the controlling device for holding fast the forward turret of the battle-ship Indiana gave way under the stress of the tremendous sea running , and the ponderous mass of steel , five hundred tons in weight , with the heavy guns shoving their long tubes out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smashing force from side to side as the ship rolled , threatening destruction and death to vessel and crew . Then it was that the master seaman on the bridge , the master seamen on the decks below it , the seamen under them , gave proof of disciplined courage and presence of mind , born of the strenuous experience of ever-recurring conflict with the ocean 's might . Down below , the engines answered to the summons from the bridge ; obedient to the nervous touch of the seaman at the wheel the vessel turned at bay to the huge gray waves , leaping up and shouldering one another , as if in hungry haste to overwhelm and drag her down beneath their depths . Like some stricken monster of the sea , the great warship wallowed and rolled , now burying her bows in the crest of some fierce comber , now rising heavily under the weight of the water rushing along her decks and pouring in cataracts over the sides . But undismayed and undaunted , officers and men , beaten down and thrown about the decks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward again and again , laboring with the sailorly skill which only the trained " habit of the sea " could give them ? with hawser and cable caught the swinging guns , actually lassoing them , as it were , checking and subduing the crushing turns of the turret 's great round bulk , and holding it fast in bonds of hemp and steel . Service in the ships ' boats ? pullingbarge or cutter , sailing-launch or steamer ? is an important factor in the development of seaman-like resourcefulness and courage . There are not only the ordinary boat-drills , ? the exercising by crews or by whole fleets under oars or sail , or the landing of a force " armed and equipped for distant service , " ? but a score and more of other duties . A squadron at anchor will have boats in the water coming and going in all directions . There are the regular ferries , so to speak , to and from the landing-place ashore ; the boats with the mailorderlies , the trim marine soldiers who act as letter-carriers ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying messages , papers , and orders from one ship to another . Here comes the admiral 's barge , sweeping smoothly along under the twelve-oared stroke of its picked crew ; the heavy " beef-boat , " loaded down with provisions for some ship , loses way , as the crew tosses oars , and the midshipman in charge rises from his seat in the sternsheets , holding hand to cap-visor in salute as the commander-in-chief passes . Duty in the boats is often severe , not to say dangerous ; it must be dirty weather indeed ? nothing short of a gale of wind ? that will prevent the regular duty-boats from making their customary trips . The history of the navy is full of tales of gallant deeds of rescue on the ocean . At sea the life-boat is always held in readiness for instant lowering , and the cry of " Man overboard " will send its crew tumbling into it , never knowing whether the alarm is one for purposes of drill , or whether they are actually to pull away to the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A monitor whose engines had broken down once anchored in soundings off the Carolina coast . A whale-boat , under command of one of the watch-officers , was sent to the distant shore to telegraph the naval authorities for assistance . The sea was running so high on the return to the ship that it was impossible to take the boat alongside to hoist her aboard . Night was coming on ; sea and wind were steadily rising ; to go back the long distance to the shore and attempt a landing in the heavy breakers that were now piling up under the increasing force of the gale would be simply exchanging Scylla for Charybdis . But the ready resourcefulness of the seaman was not to be overcome by any such conditions as faced the lieutenant and his boat 's crew . The raft-like decks of a monitor are almost awash even in corn-  | paratively quiet water , and now the sea was breaking over them fore and aft . Our lieutenant , pulling to windward , turned the bow of his boat toward the ship , and seizing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the crest of a big wave , he and his crew actually beaching their boat on the steel deck of the monitor , like fishermen coming ashore through the surf . I do not know whether the bottom of the whale-boat was stove in or not by the impact on the hard deck ; probably it was , but the lieutenant and his men were safe . Unfortunately , the seafaring population of the United States is not large enough to recruit the navy , even at the strength now authorized by law . The nation should have none but Americans in the crews of its war-ships ; but in what comparatively little deep-sea commerce it can lav claim to , the American sailor is not found in any great number before the mast , and-the flsherrnan , than whom no finer seaman can be found the world over , rarely " joins the navy , " largely because he likes the independence and freedom of his trade , is born and brought up in it , so to speak , and , above all , is a genuine " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engineroom is a " stench to the nostrils " and the coal-whip an abomination . Nevertheless , the raw material to draw from is not wanting . First there are the thousands who live and have their being on the banks of our great rivers and all along our extensive coasts by lake and sea ; then the landsmen in general ; and last , and  | best of all , those fine youngsters developed by the excellent apprentice system of the service : The law authorizes the enlistment of a " certain number of boys to serve as naval - apprentices from the time of their entry into the service until they reach the age of twenty-one years . Great pains are taken in the selection of these youths , and much care and attention are given to their education and training , first for a period at various shore stations , then on trainingships at sea , whence they are distributed to the vessels in commission throughout the fleet . They are recruited in all parts of the land , principally in the cities , although there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mentally they form the pick of the youngsters of the working-classes , from which they generally spring . Many of that most excellent body of officers ? the warrant-officers of the navy ? rise from their ranks ; the best of the young petty officers and artificers bear , in addition to their chevrons , the distinguishing mark of the passed apprentice . The ideal method of keeping full the crews of our ships would be , it seems to me , to extend the apprentice system to a degree enabling the navy to draw its enlisted force of seamen and many artificers mainly from this force , just as it draws its line-officers from the Naval Academy . Given sufficient , if gradual , expansion to the apprentice system , and liberal laws encouraging and inducing reenlistment in the navy , or enrolment in a reserve ( not a State militia , which , however , has its excellent uses ? " but that is another story " ) , it is my modest but firm conviction that the navy of the United States would possess an enlisted sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selfrespect combined with discipline and quick-witted obedience to the lawful orders of their superiors , could not be surpassed , if , indeed , equaled , by that of any other service , bar none . @#
