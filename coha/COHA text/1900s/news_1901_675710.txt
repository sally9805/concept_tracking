txt The feverish excitement of the trading on the Stock Exchange increased , if any ' thing , yesterday , and the speculative move ? ment has broadened until it seems to have embraced nearly everybody , from big opera ? tors to clerks and messenger boys in the financial district . The total recorded transactions for the day passed the 2,841,309-share mark , making it the second largest day on record , being exceeded only by Tuesday last . As on recent days , because of the rush of business , many transactions were never re ? corded , else the total would easily have been brought up to 3,500.000 shares . Even as it is , all the indications are that the present week will be far and away the biggest week that Wall Street has ever seen , and this even should the trading en the last two days become comparatively small . Already the total for the first four days is close to the high record for ary , one week . Further evidence of the volume of trading in the stock market yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House banks , which reached the figure of $525,215,108 , the second highest record for clearances in the history of that institution . The brokers on the floor yesterday were actually in despair . Their complaint was not of too little business , but of altogether too much . Worn out , many of them . indeed , completely unnerved by the steady strain upon them for the past few week$ they time and again begged their office managers to refuse any further orders , saying that they could not possibly execute them with any degree of satisfactionIn a number of cases their requests were acceded to , but in a majority of instances customers were so persistent that the orders had to be taken . Nevertheless , it is a fact that the amount of orders refused by several representative Stock Exchange houses would /est Summer have been considered a fair day 's business . THE TREMENDOUS PRESSURE . Under what pressure the brokers are acting can best be imagined when it is stated that a serious effort was made yesterday to bring about the closing of the Exchange to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rest and the overburdened officers more time to straighten out their , in some cases , highly complicated accounts . In the end this attempt to have the Exchange closed wee abandoned , but the agitation nas none the less sincere and suggestive . During the day it was currently - eportc3 that several brokere on the floor nad lapsed through overwork and exhaustinn . This is net the case , however . It is .1 " ast , though , that two telephone boys whese names could amt be learned , other than that they were styled " Joe " and " Danny ? ? r.v their fellow-members , were carried f : the floor in a fainting condition . it was said , however , that their condition was not due so much to overwork as to ? eerie te hears and rather irregular habits . But while brokers did not collapse , several of them are near to the breaking u Dien point , three at least being on Ike flora* against the advice of their rez : . ectivc pity . melees . Many of the specialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last week and generally receive a commission of one-sixteenth of 1 per cent. , have had to stop and go away for a few days ' rest because the volume of orders was too great to handle . The result was that these orders were given to the other brokers . A number of room traders , brokers trading on their own account , have reached the verge of nervous collapse . There were three brokerage houses , whose business consists largely of orders secured by private wire from other cities , who notified their out-of-town customers during the day that they could execute no more orders yesterday owing to the generally clogged condition . The execution of small orders from 100 to 250 and 300 shares each of the dominant stocks was very slow , and many of these orders went begging for a considerable period . Some were actually posted in the endeavor to find a broker with enough time to execute them . THE COMMISSIONS EARNED . The amount in commissions earned by brokers yesterday can hardly be approximately estimated . Computing the commissions at $12.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if one-fourth of the orders were done on a two-dollar basis  --  that is , one member of the Exchange acting as broker for another , and the remainder at the regular commission for outsiders , the amount derived would be $266,372.72 . The Government 's share through the revenue tax of $2 per 100 shares amounted to $56,826 . The offices of most of the active firms were opened late last night , and the hotel accommodations at the Astor House and the Stevens House were quickly taken . The request of the Stock Exchange Governors for more space on the trading floor to relieve the congestion in the telephone facilities was granted by the Produce Exchange managers , but President Barrows of the latter to-day stated that just how much more room would be given would not be announced until he had conferred with the Stock Exchange management to-day . He said that it was the sense of the managers that every possible courtesy be extended to their tenants . It was reported yesterday that a Stock Exchange membership had been sold for $70.000 and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rolston &; Hooley . The Stock Exchange authorities , however , stated that the last highprice for seats known to them was $66.000 . The demand of stockbrokers for Produce Exchange seats and a recent sale at $1.000 brought so many seats on the market that the price dropped yesterday to $600 bid . The overwork , the inability to handle many of the small orders , and the delays in sending daily notices to customers and making stock deliveries , which prevail on the Stock Exchange , have become true of the Consolidated Exchange . where the dealIna in ten-share , twenty-share , and fiftyshare orders entailed fully as much clerical work in the Exchange 's Clearing House as in the " big board . " where orders went in thousand-share lots . Many brokers on the " little board " reported an Inability to execute the smallest orders with any degree of satisfaction to either broker or customer . ATCHISON THE FEATURE . As has been the case for several days past , the stock market had one feature which stood out conspicuous above all others . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Burlington , Northern Pacific , Union Pacific , and the Steel stocks , each one of these in its turn being taken in hand and advanced very sharply , all of the issues except Steel having at one time or another had a ten-point advance , at least , to its credit in one day . Yesterday the feature of the trading was Atchison common stock , which was dealt in to the extent of over 550,000 shares . On the day previous the stock had sold at 73. then had gone up to 75. then , on the announcement of a semi-annual dividend declaration of 112 per cent .. had declined to 73 , only later to rise to and close at 7614 . Yesterday , opening up more than a point  --  the tape recording the initial dealings at 12.000 shares from 77% to 78 ? it advanced almost by leaps and bounds to 87% . Only a few hundred shares changed hands at that price , the quotation immediately thereafter beginning to tall , until it had touched 84 . There it held for some time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying orders , in which many blocks of a thousand shares came out , the quotation advanced to ** and finally closed at 87 , a net gain of 10-,4 points . To explain the wonderful activity and strength of the stock there were many rumors , but nothing that could be considered positive . One of- these told of Pennsylvania buying for chnirol ; - another that a Rock Island aliatiree was assured , and still another that leading Directors of the company had toll l'atheir trie , n4s -- that at the next dividend meetingettlAbough it is six months off , the stock will be placed on a 5 per cent . bast 's . ' ' Generally in the ; Street- the ? opinion prevails that the most reasonable explanation is that , despite their denials . Pennsylvania interests are actually buying into the Atchison property , just as they did into Baltimore and Ohio , Norfolk and Western , and Chesapeake and Ohio . The theory in the Street is that the purchase of Burlington , with which Pennsylvania has been more closely identified than with any other Western road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of the Atchison property . What lends color to the talk of Pennsylvania buying is that large blocks of Atchison stock have recently been sent to Philadelphia for what is said to be the account of Pennsylvania interests there . ? UNION PACIFIC MOVEMENT . Next in point of interest came Union Pacific , which at one time sold up to the high figure of 133. which represented a gain of over 3 points from the close of the day previous . At the high figure many realizing sales appeared , and under them the stock declined , until at the close the figure was 1 : . ! 5L4. a net loss of 1% points , on dealings in 4,60,100 shares . This , in other words , signified that the combined trading in Atchison common and Union Pacific common agg-regeated for the day more than 1.000,000 shares . This , however , can he readily understood when it is stated that in the early part of the day several firms seemed to have apparently unlimited orders to buy the two stocks . One firm alone took 50.000 shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Atchison common . Other features of the day were a 3-point rise in Chesapeake and Ohio , a 21. i-point advance in St. Paul . a 2-point gain in Denver and Rio Grande preferred , a gain of 27. , points in International Power , a rise of 5 , i points in National Biscuit , of 17 , , in Norfolk and Western , of 2 in Rubber Goods , of 3 in United States Rubber preferred , and of S points in New York Air Brake . On the other hand , some stocks heretofore conspicuous showed declines for the day . Among the losses were Amalgamated Copper . Smelters , ? 14 ; Chicago and Alton , 1 ; m : Northwest . 3 ; Lackawanna , Erie , ilk ; Great Northern preferred . 27 : : . ; Louisville and Nashville , 13,42 ; New York Central . 3IN : Reading . 1 , i-4 ; Southern Pacific ? . 1 Northern Pacific . 1 ; Wabash preferred . rvs : Wisconsin Central . Cnited States Steel common . 114 , and United States Steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the story of the market for the day . While strength was developing it , some securities , heaviress wasshowing in others . Under the circumstances , it was declared in the Street that the irregularity was only what might have been expected . There had been almost a continuous rise from the first of the week . and a reaction was declared to he not only inevitable , hut overdue . This irregularity appeared from the opening . in some measure due to the prices sent over from London . which showed advances in some stocks and declines In others . At the same time London was a large seller throughout the list , while there was a good deal of realizing . also . on the part ' of buyers who had bought early in the week and who were desirous of turning their paper profits into actual , available cash . Market observers declare that , all the conditions considered . the market stood the immense volume of realizing sales wonderfully well . THE STEEL TRUST STOCK DECLINE . As for the declines or for the advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in the case of the falling stocks , merely that the desire to sell in order to take profit was greater than the desire of other people to buy . In the stocks of the Steel Trust  --  more than 121,000 shares of the common and 61.000 shares of the preferred being traded in ? it was said that certain men who had recently been operating in the stocks were endeavoring to depress them in order to buy in at a lower level . Of news developments of the day , the most significant was the placing of Norfolk and Western common stock on a dividend basis by the declaration of a 1 per cent dividend . This was not set out as a serdi-annual declaration , but the best infoation is that it is Amended to declare - Set annual dividendshereafter , and Chat if earnings Continue at ' the present fate the next dividend to be declared will-be 2 per cent making 3 forthe year . At the same ; time . there were very persistent rumors to the - effect that Pennsylvania iS to lease Chesapeake and Ohio and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story which Tits NEW YORK TIMES published some months ago , but which at the time was denied , just as were the purchases by Pennsylvania of Baltimore and Ohio and Norfolk and Western stock . During the day call money rose at one time to C per cent .. but the rise was only temporary , most of the day 's loans being made at 5 per cent .
