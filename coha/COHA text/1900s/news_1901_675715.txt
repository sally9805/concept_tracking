txt There is something at once pathetic and admirable in the gift the ex-Empress " of the French has made to the City of Paris of the splendid cradle in which her ill-starred child was wont to lie In the days when his future seemed as bright as that of any babe in all Europe . The pathos is in the contrast between those days and these , when every promise of fortune has been broken , and the Empress , dethroned , widowed , childless , awaits the end of her desolated life in a foreign land . That which is admirable is that France should still welcome this memento of a once ruling family , and that its possession should touch a chord of sadly tried , but sincere patriotism . The results of the Second Empire can not seem to an English-speaking student excellent or even tolerable , and most that wins his sympathy in the modern history of France is associated with the struggle of able and noble Frenchmen to overthrow that regime . But the Empire must have corresponded to some essential needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment , or it could not have established itself and maintained the position in Europe which it did for a period longer than the life of any previous regime since the Revolution . Whatever its defects or its vices , it was , in a controlling sense , democratic , and it was wholly French . In effect , the accession of NAPOLEON III . was the defiance of France to the powers that had overthrown the First Empire , and for eighteen years he exerted in Europe something of the masterful Influence of the first NAPOLEON , and the French people , even after the " terrible year , " never wholly forgot the prestige he won for them . They have grown soberer with the experience of the past generation , and are working out patiently , in some difficulty , the task of self-government without the guidance of any great leader . They are in no danger of repeating the Napoleonic experiment . But they are far from wishing to banish all reminders of the imperial chapter in their history , and /east of all a memento of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , after the tradition of his native land .
