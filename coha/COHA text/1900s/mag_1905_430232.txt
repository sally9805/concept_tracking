 | DURING the last days of August all Spain was in effervescence . The frontier barriers were lowered to let Science pass . To old Castile and to Aragon came scientists from America , France , Russia , England , Germany and Italy in response to the invitation of Nature . She , as a matter of fact , was offering to all her friends , and to the astronomers in particular , one of the most wonderful spectacles that are ever to he seen . The stage was the sky , and the two great roles were played by the sun and the moon . Among the minor figures were Mercury , for the present , at least , the nearest planet to the sun ? as we hope still one of these days to discover yet another planet lost in the solar rays . Then the brilliant planet Venus , which on this occasion loses her title of morning star or evening star , without , however , losing her greatest title of nobility ? that of beauty . Finally Sirius , and many another among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of night and lent their pale splendor to this celestial celebration . The spectacle was entitled , " A Total Eclipse of the Sun . " While awaiting the commencement of the piece , let us glance around the theater . To the land of Spain from Ferrol to Tarragona came the astronomer pilgrims to ask from the Spanish sky the favor of observing one of the most magnificent phenomena of nature . To see the somber disk of the moon creep gradually in front of the radiant surface of the sun , cut across it , and finally cover and mask it completely , is a spectacle one can not have anywhere in the world . And so anyone who wishes to be a witness of it often has to go far to view the spectacle .  | They arrive , then , from every corner of the globe , these intrepid observers of the celestial wonders , to take part in this scientific solemnity . There are also not a few amateurs who have come out of curiosity to enjoy a rare spectacle . For them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their sleeping-cars or in well-appointed ships , and , being favored by fortune , they disembark with their hands in their pockets , so to say , without any other care than not to miss the passing moment of the show . They have but to use their eyes in order to be instantly recompensed for the fatigue of long journeys . For astronomers , it is a very different matter . They are powerfully armed , and their baggage is voluminous . Astronomical instruments built in the highest perfection of modern science are naturally employed for this event . Telescopes , spectroscopes , helioscopes , photographic apparatus , thermometers , barometers , actinometers , have long been installed on the field of operations , for numerous rehearsals are necessary before the great performance . The precious instruments receive all the care due to their great value ; there have been constructed for them , I will not say palaces , but shelters of canvas or of wood which protect them from all violence of the weather . In towns and villages scientists have taken lodgings , but those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit of a hill or a mountain as a point of observation , camp in their tents " under the beautiful stars . " It is not merely in the most habitable regions , of course , that these encampments have been placed . Burgos , the ancient capital of Castile , was thronged by numbers of astronomers , who filled the town and spread over its neighborhood . The houses being insufficient in number to lodge them all , the Spanish army had to lend its assistance , and has loaned more than five hundred tents to the houseless scientists from abroad . But Burgos has not obtained all the patronage of the astronomers . and large numbers of observers are spread all along the path of totality ? Oviedo . Leon , Almazan , Soria , and as far as Valencia . The northern part of the Iberian peninsula was in these last days of August the most cosmopolitan country in the world . and everyone brought thither the dominant note of his own country . The hotels situated in the zone are absolutely crammed . Everywhere is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most amusing misunderstandings . A lady , for instance , asks you to show her the nearest telegraph office . . As you are yourself not a polyglot , you reply that the country around is indeed very pretty . Similar incidents occur at every instant . There is , however , one word on which all languages agree more or less closely , and that is the word " eclipse . " You hear it at every moment . It is like a bridge thrown between the nations that are represented at this astronomical celebration . Moreover , all the observers , official scientists or amateur astronomers of a day , temporarily forget the earth and her frontiers , and her differences of language , and think only of the sky , of which we are all citizens , and which astronomy gives to all humanity as one single country . But the great day has arrived . Observers , take your places , for the show is about to begin . Let those who have no telescopes bring out their smoked glasses . Wednesday , August 30th. ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apears , shines an instant , and then hides himself again . Will it be an eclipse by the clouds rather than by the moon ? No . This morning the wind came up with the dawn and did a little house-cleaning in the sky . The clouds have been swept away . A few still linger lazily on the horizon . But these are inoffensive , and the king of orbs shines brilliantly . Since dawn everyone has been abroad . One would almost think some caprice of the moon was expected , some acceleration of her speed which would make all those a little late miss the spectacle ! The forenoon passes slowly , and everyone is impatient . From every corner news of the weather is being gleaned . Happily it is full of good promise . The radiant sun goes on his way and seems more magnificent than ever . Let us hope he will not play us any trick at the last moment . At noon we mount a high hill where our temporary observatory is situated . Already the moon has touched the orb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give out his joyous light . The heat is scorching ; and with con-siderable trouble and fatigue we drag ourselves up the side of the a r i d mountain , catching at the few tufts of lavender dotted about here and there , and scratching our hands against the stones . At last we arrive at the summit , from which one overlooks a vast extent of territory . We are eleven hundred feet above the level of the sea , and , as one may say , in a proscenium-box to admire the spectacle . Not the least obstacle comes in the way . Around us the hills stand in lines , seeming to slip into the horizon where they become confused with the bands of clouds . The panorama is marvelous in its savage beauty . The heedless sun now stands royally at the zenith . Yet the moon has already cut away a considerable notch from him , and the observers begin with attentive eyes to follow all the phases of the phenomenon .  | The sky is intensely blue , there being but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon , the Madrid time , a third of the solar disk is covered by the moon . Nothing is changed in the aspect of nature . The birds sing with " full-throated ease , " and the flowers send forth their brightness and perfume . The rivulets , which are very numerous in this region , give out their endless concert . One of them falls in a cascade from the height of an enormous rock . making each second , as it has done for centuries , a leap of one hundred and fifty feet into a river below . Two clogs , which a short while ago were frolicking about , already show signs of uneasiness . 12:47 P.M ? More than half of the solar disk is covered . The sun is a crescent of light in the sky , hidden , as for the rest of him , by the dark shadow of the earth 's satellite . 12:52 P.M. ? The daylight is sensibly decreasing . The solar crescent becomes thinner . A fresh breeze has arisen . 1 P.M. ? The sky is paling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become stronger . The temperature is rapidly going down . We feel a penetrating cold . Suddenly a cock crows , then two ; three others reply to them as if it were dawn . The atmosphere has a wan tint . It is impossible to resist a certain feeling of nervousness , as one realizes the imminent approach of an extraordinary spectacle . Every regard is fixed on the same point of the sky , and telescopes and all the instru- ments of observation are ready . All batteries are in action . 1:9 P.M. -- The sky becomes darker and darker , and the country round assumes a very sinister aspect . There is a kind of veil of sadness spread over the whole of nature . On the road at the foot of the hill there pass a flock of sheep , bleating as they go . Farther off , near a small house , the fowls are running in for shelter . 1:12 P.M. ? A solemn silence is observed by Nature . The birds are hushed . A few continue to fly , emitting little cries like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a council . They are consulting . What has happened The sun has changed its aspect . One of the little creatures , in great fear , buried itself under a tuft of thyme , whence to observe his small horizon . His small companions are not long in joining him and all . are in extreme agitation . At the same moment a hollow sound , like an arrow . strikes my ear , and I see a bat fly past . The poor thing is terror-stricken . The flies cease to buzz . Only the brooks and waterfalls continue their uninterrupted fall , splashing noisily into the valley . It is the only noise that is to be heard at the present moment . The luminous crescent of the sun be comes narrower and narrower ; the moon blots him out more and more each minute . On the horizon the few clouds have become gilded . Others , as black as ink . spread a little distance from the sun , look as if they were going to fall and crush uI have a curious feeling of oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold is intense . The sun is at its deathagony , so it would seem . One would think we were present at the end of the world . 1:15 P.M. ? The last ray of light disappears and suddenly the disk of the moon , of pitchy blackness , takes the sun 's place . Totality has begun . What a marvel it is ! What an unforgettable spectacle ! So great is our emotion that we scarcely breathe . There is no more sun , The moon covers it entirely , and we are plunged into absolute night . The dark disk of the moon is ringed round its circumference by an immense and most brilliant aureole , which is thrown far out from the sun . This corona is of the most striking silvery-white , ending in yellowish fringes on the outer rim . They would be round and regular if it were not for two streaks which come out on the south , and two others not so long on the northeast . This coronal atmosphere throws a strange and very pale light over the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phenomenon . We are , indeed , compelled to light lanterns . In the west , Venus throws out her brilliant rays , and eyes are fixed on her striking and beautiful light . In the east glimmers yellow Arcturus . Mercury appears to be shy . Looking round at my neighbors , I notice that every face has a livid appearance . The dogs bark unceasingly ' . Somewhere about , a humble little cricket sends out its monotonous note . Near to me a little blue flower hangs its head as if crushed by this gloom . The landscape has become fantastical , and one might easily believe oneself in another world . But we are very quickly brought back to earth and disturbed in these fancies by a ray of light . It is the sun which reassumes his rights . It is over ! The magical spectacle fades , the fugitive vision is finished . We have scarcely had time to admire it . We feel this is a pity , and we would fain for one more instant keep the moon at a standstill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall on the earth from west to east . Once more the country is bathed in light . Two swallows whirl around me , as if they were ill . The cricket is hushed , while the cocks sing a hymn to the sun . To the astonishment and terror of a few minutes ago succeeds an exuberant joy . The god of day is welcomed again , and several brave peasants thank this good moon from the bottom of their heart for giving hack to them the supreme light just as beautiful and just as magnificent as before . Slowly the thermometer rises again . I observed it carefully since the beginning of the eclipse . At noon it marked seventyseven degrees in the sun ; at 12:42 , sixty-  | seven degrees , and at 1:02 , sixty-three degrees , or a difference of fourteen degrees between the beginning of the phenomena and the end of totality . At last , order is reestablished in nature . The clouds , which have hitherto kept respectfully at a distance , now hurry forward to give another eclipse , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may take entire possession of the sky for all we care . The moon is far from the sun . Total eclipses of the sun have , as a matter of fact , played a most important role in astronomical discoveries relative to the physical constitution of the luminary itself . This constitution is one of the most interesting problems that science has to consider , as the whole of terrestrial life , plant and animal , hangs on the rays of the sun . If one directs one 's eye ( quickly turned away again ) on the shining disk , the dazzled optic sees nothing but fire , and keeps the impression of an inflamed globe of unparalleled brilliance , of immaculate whiteness . But seen through a proper telescope , the surface of the sun is never so calm as this . Spots often trouble its serenity , and shallows form on it . These spots , some of which are enormous , are at times even visible to the naked eye , through a piece of smoked glass , and are the indications of the agitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Is this gigantic sphere of light , then , the seat of formidable disturbances ? This is precisely the fact that one gathers from careful observation of eclipses . It is the moment of total eclipse that hato be seized on in its passing swiftness to pry into the immediate neighborhood of his Majesty the sun . What we see then is no longer the orb of day , but , on the contrary , the disk of night , the somber body of the moon placed like a wax seal over the sun . All around it a vast ring of gold , as I have already described it , throws a fantastical light into space . This aureole. which is called the chromosphere , is nothing in fact but the solar atmosphere , the nature of which is still very little known to us. except that it is a kind of covering of lire from five thousand to ten thousand miles deep , which burns continually and from which there dart out immense jets of ' lame thrown with fearful swiftness to prodigious heights . Thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these protuberances have since i868 been daily observed and registered . But this is not all . The sun has still mane secrets hidden from us . What we do know of the constitution of this great luminary we owe to the rare minutes when it is hidden by our own satellite . They art precious and all too fugitive minutes . looked for long in advance by the scientist who are anxious to obtain an abundant bar rest for science . Think of all that has to be done during the very short time of totality ? drawing , photographs , researches in spectral analysis , polarization , observations of the corona. readings of the thermometer and barometer ? much more , indeed , than is necessary . to absorb the whole of the astronomer. - attention . Such is the phenomenon that has staggered the centuries . As simple as the cause is , humanity continued for ages to be astounded at the sudden temporary absence of the sun 's light during the day , and was full of horror before this unexplained  | marvel . It can readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suddenly saw the light of day extinguished . Was it not natural that in their ignorance men should believe that the world would remain plunged in eternal night ? No more sun ! No more life-giving rays : Poor earth deprived of the eve of day and condemned to march onward like a blind thing in the infinite ! And all were seized with panic when thinking of the future , a black and bottomless gulf . This horror has given birth to a crowd of legends , and provoked innumerable incidents tragic and comic . We are all familiar with Herodotus ' tale of how the combat of the Medes and Persians was ended by an eclipse of the sun . The records of ancient history contain several other instances of the course of events taking an unexpected turn through the intrusion of this phenomenon , and they continue through the Middle Ages to this very day . While M. Janssen was in British India observing the eclipse of August 18 , 1868 , the natives who had been assigned to help him rushed away at the moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their religious rites commands that they should plunge into water up to the neck in order to counteract the influence of an evil spirit . They came back when all was over . On more titan one occasion ingenious minds have turned these phenomena to their own advantage . Thus , in the eclipse whose path crossed Natal on April 16 , 1874 , some natives who had become corrupted through contact with Europeans demanded double pay , claiming that there were , in truth , that day two distinct days separated by a night , short as it may have been . On the other hand , the proprietor of a Natal diamond-depository called his negro workers together and announced that the sun was about to die . He would , however , consent to live a few more years if he were made a present of a large diamond . The frightened miners scratched so hard in the soil that day that they found one stone of about forty-five carats , which they brought to the crafty owner . " I think that will do , "  | he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At any rate , the sun will get well quickly . " During the night of February 27 , 1877 , a lunar eclipse provoked an indescribable tumult among the inhabitants of Laos , in Indo-China . In order to frighten the monster who was devouring the queen of the night , they fired pistols at the moon , and accompanied this fusillade with frightful cries . And again , that of December 16 , 1880 , was greeted by the inhabitants of Tashkent , in Russian Turkestan , with a terrible din of pots , kettles and samovars , beaten by tireless arms . In China , eclipses are the object of important ceremonies , whose end is to reestablish the regular order of celestial motion . The emperor is considered the Son of Heaven . His government should therefore , in a way , be the reflection of the immutable order of sidereal harmony . Chinese astrology regards eclipses as troubles of the divine order , and their appearance seems to betray an irregularity in the government of the celestial empire . Therefore are they greeted by all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same ceremonies are carried out to-day . When an eclipse is visible at Peking , the imperial guard stations itself at the foot of the Rose Tower , with musicians and drummers . During the entire eclipse the drums are beaten , and the music is deafening . The whole population takes part in these manifestations , which are sometimes presided over by the emperor himself . The Hindus share these same terrors , and they include in the list of planets known to astronomers a monster which is seeking to devour both the sun and the moon . The ancient Scandinavians placed in the heavens two enormous wolves , Moongarn and Fenris , who are perpetually pursuing the sun and the moon . When the moon was eclipsed , the Incas believed firmly that she was ill and that if she should die she would become detached from the heavens , fall upon the earth and crush them . In order to make the dogs , for which they believe the moon has particular affection , howl , they provoked their cries by pulling their ears violently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt reassured . for they had no doubt that the moon would not remain insensible to the prayers of her friends and would make a supreme effort to get rid of the illness which was killing her . In the twentieth century , as in the nineteenth and eighteenth and in ancient times , the same fear strikes the ignorant peoples ? still , alas ! so numerous upon our earth ? on the occasion of an eclipse . And for a long time to come there will be men who will believe that it is very necessary to heat a drum or to strike loudly upon pots and kettles in order to deliver the orb of day from the clutches of an infernal dragon .
