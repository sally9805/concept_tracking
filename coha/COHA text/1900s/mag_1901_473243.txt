Of all the games played by men among the Pawnee Todians , none was en popular as the stick game . This was an athletic contest between pairs of young men , and tested their fleetness , their eyesight , and their skill in throwing the stick . The implements used were a ring six inches in diameter , made of buffalo rawhide , and two elaborate and highly - ornamented slender sticks , one for each player . One of the two contestants rolled the ring over a smooth prepared course , and when it had been set in motion the players ran after it side by side , each one trying to throw his stick through the ring . This was not . often done , but the players constantly hit the ring with their sticks and knocked it down , so that it ceased to roll . The system of counting was by points , and was somewhat complicated , but in general terms it may be said that the player whose stick lay nearest the ring gained one or more points . In the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl into a ring , which they used in playing the stick game . Y the bank of a river stood a lodge , in which lived four brothers and their sister . The boys made ar-rows . To the branch of a tree in front of the lodge they had hung a rawhide strap , such as women use for carrying wood , so as to make a swing for the girl . Whenever their meat was all gone and they began to got hungry , the girl used to send her brothers into the timber to cut dogwood shoots to make arrows . When the arrows were ready , she would get into the swing and the boys would swing her . As the swing moved , they would see dusty rising all around the horizon , and would know that the Buffalo were coming . Then all four boys would take their bows and arrows , and stand about the swing so as to protect the girl and not let the Buffalo come near her . When the Buffalo had come close , the boys would kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would quickly curry the girl into the lodge , and would kill so many Buffalo that the rest would be frightened and run away . So they would have plenty to eat , and the dried meat would be piled high in the lodge . One day the boys went out to get wood for arrows , and left the girl in the lodge alone . While they were away a Coyote came to the lodge and talked to the girl . He said to her : " Granddaughter , I am very poor , and I am very hungry . I have no meat in my lodge , and my children also are hungry . I told toy relations that I was coming to ask you for food , and they have been laughing at me . They said , ' Your granddaughter will not give you anything to eat . ' " The girl answered hint : " Grandfather , here is plenty of meat . This house is full of it . Take what you want . Take the fattest pieces . Take it to your children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said : " Yes , my relations laughed at me when I said I was going to visit you and ask you for something to eat They said you would not give me anything . I do not want any dried meat-1 want some fresh meat to take to my children . Have pity on me , and let me put you in the swing , so as to bring the Buffalo . I do not want to swing you hard so as to bring the Buffalo in great herds . I want to awing you only a little so as to bring a few Buffalo . I have a quiver full of arrows to keep the Buffalo off . " The girl said : " No , grandfather , I can not do this . My brothers are away . Without them we can do nothing . " Then the Coyote slapped his breast and said : " Look at me . Am I not a man and strong ? I can run around you fast , after you are in the swing , and I can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo . I have plenty of arrows , and I need only use a single one for each Buffalo . Come on , I want to swing you just a little , so that but few Buffalo will come . " So he coaxed the girl , but still she refused . After he had begged her for a long time , she agreed to let him swing her a little , and got in the swing . He began to swing her , at first gently , but all at once he pushed her very hard , and kept doing this until she swung high . She screamed and cried , and tried to get off the swing , but it was now too late . All around ? from all sides ? the Buffalo were coming in great crowds . The Coyote had made ready his arrows , and was running around the girl , trying to kill the Buffalo and keep them off , but they crowded upon . him ? so many that he could do nothing ? and at last he got frightened and ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground about the lodge , and suddenly one of the young Bulls , the leader of a big band , as he passed under the swing , threw up his head , and the girl disappeared , but the Coyote , peeping out of the lodge door , saw on the horn of this Bull a ring , and then he knew that this ring was the girl . Then the Bull ran away fast , and all the Buffalo ran after him . When the Buffalo had gone , the Coyote came out of the lodge and saw that the girl was not there . He did not know what to do . He was frightened . Pretty soon he heard the girl 's brothers coming . They had seen the dust , and knew that some one was swinging their sister , and that the Buffalo had come . They hurried back , running fast , and when they reached the lodge they found the Coyote just dragging himself out of a mud - hole . He crawled out crying , and pretended that the Buffalo had run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the mud . He told the brothers his story and said that he had tried hard to save the girl , but that he had not known that so many Buffalo would come . He said he had thought that the girl must be swung high , so that the Buffalo could see her from a long way off . The brothers felt very sorry that their sister was lost . They counselled together to see what they should do , trying to decide what would be the best plan to get her back again . While they were talking about this , the Coyote , with all the mud upon him , stood before them and said : " Brothers , do not feel sorry because your sister is lost . I will get her back again . Live on just as you always do . Do not think about this . Do not let it trouble you . I will get her back again . " After he had spoken thus , he said , " Now I am going to start off on the war-path , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He journeyed on alone considering what he should 4-1o , and at length , as he was travelling along over the prairie , he met a Badger , who said to him , " Brother , where are you going ? " The Coyote said : I am going on the war-path against my enemies . Will you join my party ? " ' The Badger said , " Yes , I will join ' you . " They went on . After they had gone a long way , they saw a Swift Hawk sitting on the limb of a tree by a ravine . He asked them where they were going , and they told him , and asked him if he would go with them . He said he would go . After a time they met a Kit Fox , and asked him to join them , and he did so . Then they met a Jackkabbit , who said he would go with them . They went on , and at length they met a Blackbird , and asked him to join them . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Soon after they had all got together they stopped and sat down , and the Coyote told them how the girl had been lest , and said that he intended to try to get her back . Then they talked , and the Coyote told them the plan that he ? the leader ? had made . The others listened , and said that they would do whatever he told them to . They were all glad to help to recover the girl . Then they all stood up and made ready to start , and the Coyote said to the Blackbird , " Friend , you stay here until the time comes . " So the Blackbird remained there where they had been talking , and the others went on . After they had gone some distance farther , the Coyote told the Hawk to stop and wait there . He did so . The others went on a long way , and then the Coyote said to the Rabbit , " You stay here . " The others went on , and at the next stopping-place he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all he left the Badger . Then the Coyote went on alone and travelled a long way , and at length he came to the Buffalo camp . He went out to the place where the young Bulls used to play the stick game , and lay down there . It was early in the morning . After a time some of the young Bulls came out , and began to roll the ring and to throw their sticks at it . The Coyote now pretended to be very sick.his hair was all covered with mud , and his tongue hung out of his mouth , and he staggered about and fell down and then got up again , and seemed to feel badly . Sometimes he would get over near to where the ring was being rolled , and then the young Bulls would call out " Here , hold on ! Get away there Do n't get in the way . " After a little while the Coyote pretended that he felt better , and he got up and went over to where the young Bulls were sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , and watched the play with the others . Every now and then two of the young Bulls would begin to dispute over the game , each saying that . his stick was the nearer to the ring , and sometimes they would wrangle for a long time . Once , while they were doing this , the Coyote went up to them and said : " Here ! You men need not quarrel about this . Let me look . I know all about this game . I can tell which stick is the nearer . " The Bulls stopped talking and luoked at him , and then said : " Yes , let him look . Let us hear what he says . " Then the Coyote went up to the ring and looked , and said , pointing : " That stick is nearest . That man has won . " The Bulls looked at each other , and nodded their heads Land said , " He knows . He is right . " The next time they had a dispute , he decided it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young Bulls had a very fierce dispute , and almost came to fighting over it . The Coyote came up and looked , and said : " This is very close . I must look carefully , but I can not see well if you are all crowding around me qwq The Buffalo crowded about the Badger 's hole , and began to paw the ground , to dig it up so as to get the Coyote and the ring , but the Badger had dug a hole a long way under the ground , and while the Buffalo were digging he ran along through this hole and came out far off , and ran as hard as he could toward the brothers ' lodge . Before he had gone very far , some of the Buffalo on the outside of the herd saw him , and called out to the others : " There he is ! There he goes ! " Then all the Buffalo started again and ran after the Badger . When they had come pretty close to him , he would stop running and dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole , trying to dig him out , he would dig along under the ground , until he had got far beyond them , and would then come to the top of the ground , and run as fast as he could toward the lodge . Then the Buffalo would see him and follow him . In this way he went a long distance . but at length he got tired and felt that he could not run or dig much farther . He was almost spent . At last , when he dug out of the ground , he saw not far off the Kit Fox , lying curled upon a rock , asleep in the sun . He called out : " Oh , my brother , I am almost tired out ! Help me ! " The Kit Fox jumped up and ran to him and Look the ring in his mouth and started running , and the Badger dug a deep hole , and staid there . The little Fox ran fast , gliding along like a bird ; and the Buffalo , when they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit Fox is a swift animal , and for a long time he kept ahead of the Buffalo . When he was almost tired out , he came to where the Rabbit was , and gave him the ring , and ran into a hole , and the Rabbit ran on . The Buffalo followed the Rabbit , but he ran fast and kept ahead of them for a long time . When they had almost caught him , he came to where the Hawk was sitting . The Hawk took the ring in his claws and flew off with it , and the Rabbit ran off to one side and hid in the long grass . The Buffalo followed the Hawk , and ran after him . They seemed never to get tired . The Hawk , after he had been flying a long time , began to feel very weary . He would sail down low over the Buffalo 's backs , and was only just able to keep above them . At last he got near to where the Blackbird was . When the Blackbird heard the pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he flew up on a sunflower stalk and waited . When the Buffalo came to the place where he was , he flew up over them to the Hawk , and took the ring on his neck , and flew along over the Buffalo . The ring was heavy for so small a bird , and he would alight on the backs of the Buffalo and fly from one to another . The Buffalo would toss their heads and try to hit him with their horns , but he kept flying from one to another , and the Buffalo behind were always pushing forward to get near the ring , and they pushed the other Buffalo ahead of them . Pretty soon the herd passed over a hill and were rushing down to the place on the river where the brothers ' lodge stood . Ever since their sister had been lost , the brothers had been making arrows , and now they had piles of them stacked up about the lodge . When they saw the Buffalo coming they got their bows and took their arrows in their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many Buffalo , and the rest were frightened and ran away . The Blackbird had flown into the lodge with the ring , and after the brothers had finished killing , they went into the lodge . And there , sitting by the fire and smiling at them , as they came in , they saw their sister .
