txt Oscar Wincke , until last Monday Cashier of the glass-manufacturing firm of Whitall , Tatum &; Co. , at 46 Barclay Street , has disappeared . He is said to have embezzled many thousands of dollars from his employers . The reticence of members of the firm has thus far made it impossible to learn what was the exact amount of the absconder 's peculations . It is certain , however , that the sum missed is considerable , for the Drummond Detective Agency has eleven of its men at work on the case . Wencke 's home is at 309 High Street , West Hoboken , just two doors from Palisade Avenue . When the cashier vanished is pot certain , but on last Tuesday some mysterious individuals , later discovered to be detectives , began to shadowi his house . They hung around the neighborhood all the afternoon , and everybody on that block and the next one wondered what the strange men wanted . Several people of the locality went to the police station near by and complained that suspicious characters were infesting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who explained their business so satisfactorily that the Captain of the precinct discharged them with apologies . Although the Captain would not tell who the strangers were the neighbors of the Wencke house soon found out . Gradually it became known that the cashier was no longer at home , and that he had not been there since Monday . Inquiries showed that small groups of detectives had continuously watched the house since that day , relieving each other every few hours , but never leaving the place entirely without surveillance . The detectives came from the Drummond Agency , the head of which was formerly Chief of the Secret Service Bureau . Only four or five of them have been shadowing the house , and two were still on duty in front of it last night . One of them said to a Hoboken policeman that eleven men in all had been detailed on the case . According to these detectives and the Hoboken police , there is a striking resemblance in character between Wencke and the defaulting employe of the First National Bank , Cornelius L. Alvord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At home and among his acquaintances in Hoboken he was quiet , almost demure . Away from his fireside in the city he was , according to the detectives , a gay liver . ' spendin- his money lavishly and generally playing the part of the " dead-game sport . ' An effort was made to obtain statements from the members of the firm of Whitall , Tatum &; Co. last night . Albert H. Tatum , when a card was sent to him at his home , at 12 West Bighteenth Street , declined to be seen . Charles A. Tatum , who lives at 111 West Sixty-ninth Street . answered an inquiry about Wencke as follows : No , I have n't anything to say . I ca n't tell you anything at all just now . ' " When will you be ready to make the matter public ? " he was asked . His reply was : " Monday  --  perhaps . Maybe not then. , Good-night .

Last night a Deputy Sheriff of , Hudson County took possession of Wencke 's home , attaching all the property therein . Mrs. Wencke and her two children were there , but they could not be seen . When the Deputy Sheriff was questioned , he answered : " We have attached these goods because Wencke 's employers claim that he has embezzled them . I do not know the details of the case , nor how much money the man is accused of having taken . You can probably learn all that at the Sheriff 's office ou Monday . Wencke vanished suddenly some days ago . I do n't know the exact day . Where he is now I have no idea . " The home of the missing man is a threestory wooden house . On the outside it is far superior to the other residences of the vicinity , and its interior furnishings are very elegant . There is a billiard room , as well as other luxurious appurtenances suggestive of affluence . Mrs. Wencke and the two children were the only occupants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was learned that Mrs. Wencke had staid closely indoors ever since her husband 's disappearance , refusing to see any callers or to be interviewed by reporters . Across the street from the house lives a man who is a bookkeeper , who is employed with Whitall , Tatum &; Co . He claims to know nothing whatever of the charges against the cashier . Wencke. according to a man who has known him since he was a boy , came originally from Red Bank . N. J. , where h ! s family is prominent socially and otherwise . Removing to Jersey City when a mere lad . Wencke himself has lived in Hudson County ever since . All the time his prosperity was apparent to those around him , but with his neighbors he had no reputation of being a sporting character .

Neither the detectives nor the Hoboken police , according to their statements , know what is the sum said to have been appropriated by the man for whom they are searching . A police officer expressed his opinion last night as follows : ' There is no doubt that it Is a good . big amount . Drummond would n't put out eleven men for nothing , I can tell you . One of the detectives told me that he could n't name the figure . but that he knew it ran far up into the thousands . And as I said , the way they are going about the thing proves the steal was a whopper. "
