txt On land around the newly launched battleship Connecticut at the navy yard there is a guard of armed men ready to halt any suspicious person . Near by , ready for quick action , Is a navy tug , manned with marines who have instructions to shoot and kill if any unauthorized man tries to get near the big ship , by day or night . All of this because three deliberate attempts have been made to wreck the product of a Government shipyard . The third attempt was made one day last-week when somebody , evidently a skilled workman , drilled a hole through a steel keel. plate , five-eighths of an inch thick .. According to one of the naval constructors , the work of the vandal took about twenty minutes . The hole in the Connecticut 's bottom was found just after the battleship was , launched last Thursday . The last of the water that had got inside was pumped out on Saturday . That the great ship was not seriously damaged was due to the perfect construetiOn of her water-tight compartments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways , and immediately after the pumps were started , and most of the water kept out . It was not until Saturday that the work of repairing the damage was complete . Then all of the workmen at the yard were notified and asked to help find the guilty man . The hole was only about an inch in diameter . This was large enough , however , to admit sufficient water to fill the compartment , and soon after the ship hit the water the compartment began to fill . That the work was that of a man employed in the construction of the vessel there seems to be no doubt . This view is accentuated by the fact that the hole was bored into the cribwork , , which made it impossible to discover it from the Outside . On Thursday when the great ship plunged down the ways there were only a few workmen on board , and as work for the rest of the day was suspended , very few of those employed on the ship knew of what had happened until notified by the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the deed might have been employed by some of the big private shipbuilding yards , but this was laughed at by the authorities at the yard . Another theory is that the man responsible for the act had a grievance against the Government . When the work on the ship began there . was ' some little friction , but that has long ago passed away , and the enthusiasm of the men employed - in their efforts to win the race in construction with the Newport News Dry Dock and Shipbuilding Company , which concern is building the Louisiana , a sister ship of the Connecticut , has often been commented upon . On the result of the competition in construction will hinge to a great extent the future procedure of the Navy Department in the construction of war vessels . In the last few days several new faces have appeared among those employed hi the construction of the battleship , and these new-comers are said to be attached to the United States Secret Service . The workmen are indignant , and to a man declare that they will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the culprit . That the authorities are greatly worked up is admitted , and last night one of the highest officials at the navy yard said that the affair was one of the most intricate to unravel that had ever come before the Navy Department . The officers are in constant fear that some additional outrage will be perpetrated , and last night when it was I remarked that the vandal might possibly attempt some other and more awful means to ruin the vessel , the officer in question said that such a contingency had been thought of , and as far as possible provided against . The naval tug now guarding the ship goes on duty at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and does not go off until 8 o'clock in the morning . At the noon hour all the workmen are now required to leave the ship , and promptly at 5 o'clock , the close of the work day , every man on the ship must promptly lay down his tools and leave the ship . " There is undoubtedly a mighty cunning scoundrel at large in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard last night , " and so far we have not got the slightest idea as to his identity . We are confident that the man is either a lunatic or an Anarchist . or perhaps both , and we are doing our utmost to catch him . However , the outlook is very gloomy , and really I see very little hope of discovering him : It was very easy for the man to bore the hole , and it - was also quite natural that the guards did not detect him . A marine , you know , is not a skilled laborer , and has no way of knowing whether a workman is doing what he is yxpected to do . " The first attempt to damage the Connecticut was made several months ago , when holes were bored through rivets that held together some of the keel plates . This was the work of a skilled laborer . The Inspectors discovered the vandal 's work in time . The second was discovered just before the launching , when a bolt an Inch and a half in diameter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al1 1 most the exact centre of the great greased way over which the battleship slid into the water . It was under the water and protruded five or six inches above the ways .
