Mrs. Paget Toynbeel has undertaken to prepare for the Clarendon Press a new edition of the Letters of Horace Walpole , and desires to make it as complete as possible . Nearly two hundred letters which are not included in current editions have already been secured . Others doubtless remain in private hands , and the loan of such or of careful copies is requested . Mrs. Toynbee 's address is Dorney Wood , Burnham , Bucks , England . The new edition will make ten or eleven octavo volumes . Some limited editions announced are worth recording . Preston &; Rounds Co. , Providence , will put on sale only 200 copies of the ' Civil and Military List of Rhode Island , 1647-1800 , ' a list of all officers elected by the General Assembly from its organization , compiled from the records by Josepn Jencks Smith . More than fifty thousand names will appear in it . One thousand numbered sets of the Holly Edition in forty volumes of the Complete Works of Washington Irving , newly illustrated in photogravure by a score of artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Complete Works in twenty volumes , with numerous full-page illustrations , are offered by G P. Putnam 's Sons , who will also sell by subscription the Otsego Edition of Fenimore Cooper 's Works in sixteen volumes . Finally , but one hundred copies of ' The Solitary Summer , ' printed on Japanese vellum , will be obtainable of Macmillan Co . The works of Theodore Roosevelt , in fifteen volumes , to be sold separately , will be published by the Messrs Putnam in a " Sagamore Series . " The initial volume , ' American Ideals , ' will contain a biographical and critical memoir by Gen. F. V. Greene-The final volume , chronologically , ' The Rough Riders , ' is included by arrangement with the Messrs . Scribner . It is , we are assured in the prospectus , " everywhere recognized as one of the most perfect chapters of military history ever penned  --  both for manner and matter . " The Wakefield Edition of the Complete Works of Oliver Goldsmith in the press of Harper &; Bros. will comprise twelve volumes , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peter Cunningham supplies note and comment . More than one hundred photogravure illustrations will adorn the text . The same firm will publish ' Napoleon . The Last Phase , ' by Lord Rosebery , ' The Riddle of the Universe , ' by Ernst Haeckel , The Story of 19th Century Science , ' by Henry Smith Williams , and ' Thrilling Days in Army Life , ' by Gen George A. Forsythe . Additional announcements from Houghton , Mifflin &; Co. are ' Sir Joshua Reynolds ' and ' Murillo ' in Miss Estelle M. Hurll 's popular Riverside An Series . James Pott &; Co. will soon have , ready ' Causes of the Outbreak in China , , by the Rev. F. L. Hawks Pott , D.D , President of St. John 's College , Shanghai . An Index to the 28 volumes - of St. Nicholas is in the press of the Helman-Taylor Co. , Cleveland , against the new year . It has been prepared by the staff of the ' Cumulative Index , ' and will be a dictionary catalogue in form . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge edition of her complete poetical works just issued by Houghton , Mifflin &; Co . The condensed " Juvenilia " alone occupy nearly thirty pages in double column . The editing has been done by a woman , presumably Miss Harriet Waters Preston , - who furnishes the biographical sketch and some annotations in addition to the customary introductions to the poems . The familiar portrait of Mrs. Browning faces the vignette of Casa Guidi on the engraved title-page . Mrs. Anna Hollingsworth Wharton intimates , in her introduction , the motive for reproducing Mrs. Elizabeth F. Ellet 's halfcentury-old ' Women of the American Revolution , ' just issued in two volumes by George W. Jacobs &; Co. , Philadelphia . Such an enterprise bas been rendered a profitable venture by the recent rise of " various patriotic societies . . . organized among women . " The work is pleasing in appearance and has many portraits , and will , no doubt , fall in with the current unhappy association of patriotism with war alone . We see this influence percolating to youthful strata in Miss Maud Humphrey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hand long practised in delineating childhood , accompanied by semi-historical text and verse from the pen of Miss Mabel Humphrey , objectionable if only on the score of English . Frederick A. Stokes Co. are the publishers . Mountaineering literature is expensive , and many readers must be content to borrow Alpine books from the public library . However , Sir W. M. Conway 's ' Alps from End to End ' ( Lippincott ) , which five years ago brought a high price , has been well reprinted in comparatively cheap form . As we reviewed this volume when it appeared , we need only recall the fact that it ranks well among those delightful works which have had their origin in holiday scrambles above the snow line . Topographically itis very comprehensive , and it brings two Gurkhas into the unusual setting of Switzerland and the Tyrol . The geographical supplement , by Mr. Coolidge , is brief , but important to climbers . We may add that the profuse and clever illustrations of Mr. A. D. McCormick are made a part of this cheaper edition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is also a reprinted book of travel , the first edition of which was published in London a little less than two years ago . A link between the two volumes is furnished by Mr. A. D. McCormick , the illustrator of both . He had never seen a mountain until he was taken out by Sir Martin Conway to climb Pioneer Peak , if possible , and , at any rate , to make drawings for the ' expedition . Since then , he has become an authority on Himalayan and Alpine scenery . ' Among the Himalayas , ' which can now be bought for about one-third of its original price , is a record of travel rather than of sport . Major Waddell has explored the district of Sikhim more thoroughly than any one since the days of Sir Joseph Hooker , and , though no climber , he has seen his share of danger . The crossing of a Himalayan torrent on a rickety cane-bridge will try the nerves as severely as the sharpest arete . The cost of travelling in the districts of Nepal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toil so trying , that few exploring parties enter that section of the Indian hill country . Major Waddell 's narrative is well written and embraces both land and people . Of the mountains , he adds fuller information about Everest than about Kanchenjunga . But whether Everest is really higher than all its neighbors , he had no means of determining . ' Pictures of the Old French Court , ' by Catherine Bearne ( Dutton ) , is at best a slight contribution , whether to history or to biography . If it were better executed , we might compare it with some of the numerous books which the late Mrs. Oliphant composed . But ' The Makers of Florence ; ' The Makers of Venice , ' ' Jeanne d'Arc , ' etc. , were grounded upon a firmer foundation of fact , and were certainly written in a better style . The subjects of Miss Beanie 's sketches are Charles V. and Jeanne de BoUrbon , Charles VI . and Isabeau de Bavibre , and Anne de Bretagne . She has collected a good deal of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ' L'Art de Verifier les Dates , ' but her use of historical authorities is unconvincing . For instance , she should know whether the name of a modern writer to whom she is greatly indebted , and whom she cites passim in her first sketch , is Simeon de Luce or Streams Luce . She uses both forms with impartiality . This is an average piece of historical book-making , but lacks the erudition which should accompany its setting forth of footnotes . The illustrations are better than the text . ' The Private Memoirs of Madame Roland ' ( McClurg ) is a reprinted translation of the autobiography which the Girondist Egeria wrote at Ste.-Palagle shortly before her execution . The English version which is followed by the present publishers is one of 1795 . It has long been out of print and may possess some claim upon modern notice . though in places it seems awkward . Mme Roland , the disciple of Plutarch , shared the biographical talent of her master , albeit her manner of writing differs tote owl ? from his . In such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but take herself seriously . Yet sometimes one observes an added touch of the philosophical and abstract spirit which was a quality of the Girondist leaders . For example , " At length I became the wife of a man of genuine worth , who loved me more in proportion as his knowledge of me increased . Married thus with my own full consent , I found nothing to make me repent of the step ; I devoted myself to him with a zeal perhaps more ardent than discreet . . . . I have not for a moment ceased to behold in my husband one of the most estimable of men , to whom I deem it an honor to belong ; but I have often been sensible of a certain lack of parity between us , and that the ascendancy of a somewhat masterful character , added to twenty years of seniority , rendered one of these superiorities too great . " Mme. Roland is both a heroine of romance and an historic personage whom no one could think of overlooking . Accordingly , this translation will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrations are good , but we should have preferred to see the Goupil portrait used for a frontispiece . Fresh editions of George Borrow 's works continue to spring from the renewed interest in his literary genius and singular character . We have before us a one-volume ' Bible in Spain ' ( Putnams ) , with the notes and glossary of the late Mr. U. R. Burke Borrow 's text requires some comment and a great deal of explanation . For instance , where one 's knowledge of Romany is restricted to the meaning of such words as crallis , Corahai , hokkawar , etc , he will need to have the " crabbed Gitano " translated at many points where the author hurries on without a note . Those who are familiar either with Borrow 's personality or With the way in which ' The Bible in Spain ' was composed , will not feel surprised at the unannotated form in which it went to the printer ; and at remained for nearly two generations ' without any careful editor . Mr. Burke , himself a historian of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borrow 's other writings. - - His notes , without being obtrusive , are frequent , clear , and , in most cases , conclusive . Unfortunately , his death occurred before the volume could be printed , and the preparation of the glossary fell into other hands . However , Mr. H. W. Greene of Magdalen College , Oxford , took up the unfinished task and brought it to a successful end . The glossary is very full and deserves the notice of philologists . Besides several etchings , this edition contains a good map of the Peninsula , upon which the course of Borrow 's four journeys is traced . ' The Life of Major-General James Shields , ' by William H Condon ( New York the author ) , purports to be the only full story of the career of a highly picturesque personage , who , partly by talent and partly by fortune , obtained distinction in two American wars and represented two States in the Senate , viz. , Illinois for six years and Minnesota for one . But this story is so ill arranged , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great man , that the true merit of Shields is hard to extract from the narrative . For example , Shields was in command of the division of Banks 's Shenandoah army which , in March , 1862 , inflicted a defeat upon Stonewall Jackson , and just missed , through the fault of some officer , whether of Shields himself or one of his subordinates , surrounding and possibly capturing Jackson The biographer has gathered all the contemporary or later newspaper accounts which are accessible with regard to these affairs , and printed them in detail ; but of critical discussion of the reasons which eventuated in Shields being refused the promotion which seemed to be his desert after the battle , or of any rational explanation why he seemed to be in ill favor at Washington , there is none The title-page illustrates the careless and bombastic character of most of the book . " Hero of Three Wars and Senator from Three States " The third war and State appear to be of the author 's imagination . Among the several naval books published and aueounced this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul - Jones . One of these appears as one of the " Great Commanders Series " published by D. Appleton &; Co . Its author is the Rev. Cyrus Townsend Brady , who promises to become one of the prolific writers of the day . The first of the Commanders Series- was Mahan 's ' Farragut ' ; this is the second of the naval biographies , but the contrast from any point of view is unfavorable to the later biographer . He has not , among other things , exercised the care in preparation shown by Mahan , and several instances of this will be observed by comparing Jones 's letters to Mr. Hewes and others with the statements at variance made by Mr. Brady . Take also the unsatisfactory reference made to . the early life of Jones in this country , and the dubious account given of the assumption by the former John Paul of the name of Jones . Mr. Brady deplete Jones more as an adventurer than as a sometime planter and slave-owner . In other respects also inaccuracies will be found in this perhaps hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Souvenirs , and Other Sketches ' ( Rivingtons ) , the Hon. Mrs. Lionel Tollemache has brought together a few magazine articles , products of leisure and enforced retirement , not specially noteworthy further than for the kindliness and good breeding they exhibit . Several of these papers give their readers a fair impression of the trivialities which for the most part make up the life of a dweller in -a Swiss , or other , Karort . The two longest essays are biographical , and deal with the almost forgotten Charles de Bonstetten , and with the earlier , unexceptionable years in the life of George Sand . Of Bonstetten the writer gives a tolerably lifelike picture , which brings out , entirely without malice prepense , the peculiar color of moral priggishness that too often . attends the didacticism of Protestant Switzerland . Three or four enigmatical fables serve to add to the bulk of the small collection . New Testament scholars will welcome the appearance again of Professor Gregory of Leipzig in the field where he is a master . The first volume of his long-expected work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been published in German by Hinrichs of Leipzig . It is an octavo of 478 pages , in which , after a summary account of N. T. palaeography as respects materials , implements , scribes , characters , etc. , the author proceeds to deal with the sources of our New Testament text under four divisions , viz. , Greek Manuscripts , Greek Liturgical Books , Ancient Versions , both the Eastern and the Western , and Church Fathers . Only the first two of these four classes of helps find place in the present volume . Its contents consist , in the main , of a careful revision and enlargement of the Prolegomena of Tischendorf 's " Eighth Larger Edition . " During the ten years that have elapsed since the completion of that portion of the Prolegomena , much new material has accumulated which Dr. Gregory has faithfully utilized . Accordingly , for fulness and accuracy of information respecting the sources of our Greek New Testament the present volume , for the ground it covers , stands unrivalled . The concluding volume we are encouraged to hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Prof. Francis Brown 's ' Hebrew and . English Lexicon of the Old Testament ' ( Houghton , Mifflin &; co. ) ' brings us down to the root S P D through 704 of the more than 1,100 pages which will , it may be inferred by comparison with other Hebrew lexicons , constitute the completed work . Lexicons , as a rule , are a long time a-making , and this one is no exception to the rule . Its speedy completion is a desideratum for Hebrew scholars . There is no satisfactory Hebrew-English dictionary available at present , and none of the Hebrew-German dictionaries is equal to this work , so far as it has progressed , in thoroughness , sober common sense , and the scientific use of the latest critical results . Among the notable . articles in the present part is one on nephesh , commonly translated in the English Bible as " soul , " more often meaning , however , " self " or " life " or " person " Under mazzebra , the " pillar " of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hebrews ; the arrangement of references showing that these sacred stones were used and allowed until the seventh century , when they were " condemned for Israel by Deuteronomie code and Deuteronomic redaction of Kings . " Lammenazzeack , rendered in our Bible " to the chief musician , " which occurs in the heading of fifty-five Psalms , is explained as showing that these Psalms belonged originally to a " Director 's Psalter , " which was " probably the grayer-book of the synagogue of the Greek period . " To this prayer-book belonged , also , the third chapter of Habakkuk . The mysterious selak of the Psalter indicated the " place of benedictions , " and came into use in the late Persian period . We turn children loose in Shakspere as we do in the Bible , confident that the occasional grossness will be overlooked or fail to be understood , whereas , if we undertake to read aloud , we must perforce skip and omit . Or if , again , we use the plays in school discipline , or put them on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence , no apology need be offered for Mrs. Sarah Willard Hie-stand 's " Beginner 's Shakspere , " in D. C Heath &; Co. ' s " Home and School Classics , " so far as it is abridged for the reason above suggested , and on the score of intelligibility or want of interest In favor of her method is to be urged this editor 's well-stated view that the wrong done to literary masterpieces by making them objects of classroom drill may be mitigated by cursory reading for its own sake , with hardly a note of explanation . After the spell has been fastened and the general plot better comprehended for the excisions , the analytic consideration may be counted upon to enhance interest rather than to repel . " The Tempest " and " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " are the first two numbers Other issues in the same commendable series , which is illustrated , by the way , and attractively printed in bold letter , are Mrs Swing 's ' Jackanapes , ' and Hamerton 's ' Chapters on Animals , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goody Two-Shoes , ' edited by Charles Welsh , etc . It would be impossible to examine in detail the numerous volumes in the " Star " series of English Classics undertaken by the Globe School-Book Company of New York and Chicago . They are aimed not at the primary but at the high school , and the names of the editors show a real endeavor to provide an apparatus of high quality . Take , for example , as proof of independence and insight , Prof. William Hand Browne 's analysis of the character of Dr. Primrose in the ' Vicar of Wakefield , ' or Miss Mary A. Jordan 's refusal to make Burke 's Speech on Conciliation with America conform to the ancient canons of oratory . The volume last named merits exceptional attention for the pains taken to illuminate the subject from every side . Other volumes are plays of Shakspere , novels of Cooper and Scott and George Eliot , poems from Milton and Tennyson , etc . The mechanical part has been very well looked after Dr. Elliott Coues 's monumental edition of the Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingsley in her efforts to condense and give continuity to the narrative of this most famous expedition Her little volume , ' The Story of Captain Meriwether Lewis and Captain William Clark , for Young Readers ' ( Werner School Book Co ) . besides recording the salient features of the exploration , contains a number of maps and illustrations , and a short mtroductory account , by the editor , of the earlier discoveries in the Northwest . Mr. Gelett Burgess 's patent hydrocephalous type of cranium has a peculiarly unpleasing effect as applied to children in his ' Goops , and How to Be Them ' ( Frederick A. Stokes Co ) . His quarto volume purports to he " a manual of manners for polite infants " done into nursery jingle and Illustrated in this clever artist 's peculiar manner But infants naturally polite would be in much danger of learning for the first time about vulgar ways , while the humor of the illustrations is destructive of a sense for beauty and refinement at once . Not a few of the stanzas , it must be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings , would be a real addition to the mnemonics of correct habits in the nursery and elsewhere . With the original text of ' Robinson Crusee ' the brothers Loins and Frederick Rhead have combined a series of illustrations and decorative borders cleverly executed with the pen ( New York . R. H. Russell ) . The artists ' originality consists in having frankly accepted Defoe 's own location of Crusoe 's island , off the mouth of the Orinoco : and in the West Indies , accordingly , they have made studies of tropical vegetation and animal life to give a reasonable setting to the story . So far as youthful readers are concerned , this is surely a work of supererogation , implying no gain , say , over Stothard 's unstudied designs His fancy and technical skill are on a higher plane . Still , the edition has no doubt found its excuse for being The typography is above the common , but we can more easily forgive the overweighted running-title than we can the unindented-paragraph affectation . The fifth issue of Meyer 's ' HistorischGeographischer Kalender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemcke &; Buechner ) , shows changes and improvements , within its steadfast scheme , in conformity with the wishes of a large body of patrons . Among the illustrations , those of places , from Menem , serve as a bond of unity with the precedmg issues , natural science is more extensively represented , and there is still a sprinkling of fresh engravings from photographs after nature . Nothing more up to date , perhaps , in this class , can be named than the view on ' folio 164 of the railway station at Kilmdi , in Mombassa , on the line of the Uganda Railroad . The British protectorate of Uganda embraces a million inhabitants . ? The third in the series of ten octavo volumes of " The World 's Orators , " edited by Guy Carleton Lee , Ph.D , and published by G. P. Putnam 's Sons , deals with ' Orators of the Early and Medieval Church ' Twenty-two of these , ten Eastern and twelve from the West , are represented by twenty-nine specimens If so familiar a source as the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to see why St. Paul 's address to Agrippa should have been preferred to his masterly speech at Athens , unless because the latter is so short and obviously fragmentary . Among successors of the apostles , the difficulties of selection were no doubt considerable ; but an orator is expected to be oratorical , and higher flights than are here offered might be looked for from Chrysostom and Augustine . Yet a peculiar frame of mind is needed to find enlivening reading in old sermons , and to the uncialstered reader almost any samples of the hortatory or expository utterances of long ago are apt to seem not only remote but somewhat rudimentary . The lovers of light cherish a kindly feeling towards Origen , but it can not be pretended that his explanation of " The Parable of the Dragnet " adds to our knowledge . The " Seven Rhythms " of Ephrem Syrus on " The Pearl " ( i. e. , the Faith ) are imaginative rather than illuminating ; and , though the authors were so eminent , it is difficult to be deeply interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Birthday , " or Gregory the Great " On Job . " ? But perhaps it is considering too curiously to seek edification from these antique prelections : they should be approached from another side They are monuments , historical landmarks ; or , if not quite so much , at least illustrations of the standards and tastes of the past . The editor admits that some of his selections " are more valuable as indicating steps in progress than as brilliant specimens of eloquence " If even the more personal and intimate among them ? Gregory Thaumaturgus 's Panegyric on Origen , that of Nazianzen on his friend Basil , and his Farewell to his patriarchate , Urban IL 's speech at the Council of Clermont urging the crusade , and St Bernard 's lament " On the Death of his Brother " ? have their points a little dulled by time , we should remember that these , and not only these , but the less notable efforts here associated with them , " seemed to their hearers eloquent beyond criticism . " Dr. Lee is surely too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rules of the twentieth century , " since we do not yet know what those rules will be . Into this company of fathers and doctors of the Church one incongruous figure has been  --  perhaps too liberally  --  admitted . Constantine the Great was fond of orating , but ( from our modern viewpoint ) the pulpit was hardly the place for him , and " The Coming of Our Lord in the Flesh " not exactly a suitable topic . The best that can be said of this appearance of Saul among the prophets is that he die-ported himself more gracefully than did the late Col James Fisk on a somewhat similar occasion . It is a pity that Dr. Lee did not follow this excerpt with one from Eusebius 's laudations of the Christian Emperor . The ' Life of Constantine ' would surely afford passages sufficiently oratorical , and fully illustrative of the ideas and modes of expression of that age . But if other sources than professed speeches had been drawn upon , the epistle of Ignatius to the Romans affords passages more poetical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as now , New Hampshire was the first of the New England States for which the Census Office made public the statistics of population by minor civil divisions . We then examined those statistics in some detail , because of the light they threw upon the movements of population in rural New England . A similar study now shows that the rural towns , as a class , are still losing inhabitants , although such loss has not been quite so great in the last ten years as it was in the decade between 1880 and 1890 . In 1890 every one of 148 of the 249 towns of the State had fewer inhabitants than it had in 1880 . This Year every one of 133 towns has a less numerous population than it had ten years ago . One hundred and thirty-six towns , or considerably more than half of all the towns of the State , have to-day fewer inhabitants than they had in 1870 . The losses of population have been , as a rule , in the towns which were already sparsely inhabited . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards of 4,000 inhabitants , not one has a less population than it had in 1890 , although it appears probable that , had it not been for an extension of its boundaries during the decade , Laconia might now show a decrease . Of the nineteen places which now have between 2,000 and 4,000 inhabitants each , five are less populous than they were a decade ago . Of the 25 which now have between 1,500 and 2,000 inhabitants each , 9 have suffered a loss since 1880 . Of the 40 with between 1,000 and 1,500 inhabitants each , one-half have gained , the other half have lost . Of the 150 each of which has less than a thousand inhabitants , only 51 , or just about one-third , have a more numerous population than they had in 1890. - The following tables , reproduced from our columns of ten years ago , and now brought down to date , show how far in the last half century the process of concentration has been going on The population is shown ( A ) for 35 towns which in 1890 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 69 towns which in 1890 had each between 1,000 and 2,000 inhabitants ; ( C ) for 145 towns which in 1890 had each less than 1,000 in-habitants : deleted table The largest places have more than doubled their population since 1850 The middle class have slightly fewer inhabitants than they had fifty years ago . The least populous have- one-third fewer people than they had In 1850 . In the middle of the century , each of the three classes of towns contained about one-third of the entire population . Now , the largest has about three-fifths , and the smallest between one-fifth and one-sixth of the whole . - According to a statistical table in the recently published twentieth volume of Meyer 's KOnversations-Lexikon ( third annual supplement ) , based upon the latest data furnished by the boundary treaties between the Powers , it would appear that all but about one-seventh of the African continent is now included in some " sphere of influence " or another . The French sphere is the largest , comprising about 3,700,000 square miles ( about the extent of Europe ) out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 2,400,000 ( including the Boer territories ) Then follow in order Germany , Belgium ( Congo Free State ) , and Portugal , each with somewhat less than a million square miles The Egyptian sphere ( about 400,000 square miles ) may properly be regarded as part of the British The extent of the French sphere will appear less imposing on consulting the map of Africa contained in the preceding volume ( giving the boundaries laid dovrn in the Anglo-French convention of 1899 ) , which shows that within this domain is included the greater part of the sands of the Sahara Italy continues to claim a protectorate over a sandy Eritrean waste of 250,000 square miles , and Spain , in addition to her islands , would still like to be considered as entitled to a big strip of Sahara coast-land . The British sphere ( including Egypt and her dependencies ) is estimated to contain in round numbers about 50,000,000 souls ; the French , 35,000,000 ; the Belgian , 17,000,000 ; the German , 9,000,000 ; the Portuguese , 8,000,000 The statistical enumeration before us winds up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is designated as Herrenloses Gebiet , or " Territory without a master .

The buildings of the first five institutions stand within the grounds of the former domino of Naga , in the northwestern part of the city , but the College of Agriculture is in one of the suburbs of Tokio In the evolution of this institution , called , since 1897 , Teik-oku Daigaku ( Divine Country Great School ) , to distinguish it from the sister institution then founded in Kioto , Japanese have for the most part replaced the foreigners as professors and instructors , though many of the native officers of administration and instruction bear titles or degrees won in the institutions of Europe and America .

At present , appointment of foreigners to powLiens in either of the univer sities is exceptional .
