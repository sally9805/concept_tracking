WE have reached the noontide of the year ? the noontide also of the Magazine 's year . This House of Imagination is newly created for the expansive hospitality of a high festival ; its towers and arches lifted high and its pleasure-gardens wide-spreading , to meet the lofty skies and the ample luxuriance of midsummer . The month of August was named after the Roman Emperor Augustus , but the name is significant also , through its derivation ( from augeo , to increase ) , of the season 's opulence . Curiously , by the change of a single letter we have the Latin angustus , conveying the opposite meaning , that of narrowness or confinement We in these pages meet the month before its coming , being still in July , and so much nearer , therefore , to the summer solstice . August itself is a little after noon , when the fulness of summer is expressed in ripeness , and the harvests betoken the reaper , who in the green awaits the gold . It is a rich , Plutonian month , noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mystery of June 's deeply infolded life is lost in this open , wide - awake magnificence of accomplishment . Almost Nature seems to take an air of worldliness , especially in her response to human husbandry , serving uses that eclipse her proper and more heavenly ministry . John Burroughs , in this number , paints for us a faithful portrait of August ; and he draws attention to some hidden processes of Nature that are going on pre-paratory to a new spring-time even while the summer is declining with her diminishing days , yielding more and more to darkness and death . No door is closed , but another door is opened . Some years ago the authors of The Unseen Universe propounded this principle , giving it a universal application . According to this view an invisible involution goes on concurrently with the visible evolution . The other side of every unfolding of life is an infolding for a new emergence . With the decay of the universe another universe is invisibly shaping , and is to appear upon the death of the old . The hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we know of the physical world ; at least we know of nothing contradicting it . Of course any number of questions could be put concerning it by the meanest intelligence that no intelligence the most profound could answer ; but that is true also of the shaping of any universe . It may be , indeed , that the tendency to new involution dominates the evolution now going on ? that all things are drawn on by things to come , so that our idea of heredity must be reversed , and the term " final cause " be given its natural and literal meaning . The plant begins and ends in a seed ; but in this view the terminal or ultimate seed determines and dominates its development . All that we are or do is one side of a web which is being woven according to a pattern on the other and invisible side ? the pattern of what we are becoming . With due respect , we suggest this view of life to Professor Haeckel for a new solution of The Riddle of the Universe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Magazine , like Nature , prepares its next year 's work while the present year 's golden harvest is in evidence . Already its next great serial story is promised and in preparation , and so with other important features to be unfolded in 1902 . In many ways the conduct of a great magazine simulates the operations of Nature . It is not made out of hand ; it is born and it grows . There is a certain inevitability about it from the outset . It is not a matter of so much capital or even of so much brains . The richest man living , assisted by the most brilliant talent that wealth can command , might publish a magazine , as he might own and run a yacht for pleasure , or a factory for profit , and he might make a successful venture . His magazine might win general popularity if wisely conducted with that end in view , or , if so designed , might adequately occupy some special field . Magazines have been started in that way ? i. e. , from outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . material and intellectual resources ? and have succeeded . But for a magazine to be not merely successful , but institutionally important , entering so intimately into the life and thought of a people that its inevitableness is conceded , something more is necessary . There must be an imperative call for it in the conditions attending its birth , so that its emergence seems spontaneous . It must in itself have the power of creative life , making large demands upon its environment . Even its sponsors in baptism may not comprehend its genius , and must needs wait upon it with patience and docility , such plans as they make for it being modestly tentative . If they unwittingly put upon it an unnatural burden , it will assert itself with that miraculous strength that in the germinant seed lifts a paving-stone . As money can not make nor mind invent this living thing , so they are not adequate to its continuance . The pattern of what , according to its own genius , it is naturally meant tobe dominates its development . It refuses to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Else it could have no life , but only such motion as may be imparted to a machine . There have been a few such magazines in this country and in England , having a " touch of nature " in them from the first , by which they are distinguished from all others . When any new species of organic life appears upon the earth , it is because it is allowed by the existing comlitiuns . Thus it is with human institutions . The class of magazines of which we are writing come in like manner , by permission , and the circumstances permitting them enter into their texture and complexion . In the case of Blackwood and in that of the Atlantic Monthly , it would seem that a group of writers called each of these periodicals into being to serve as their organ of expression . How many of our readers know who were the first publishers of the Atlantic Monthly ? Then , again , as in the case of Trarper 's , and afterwards of Scribner 's , the character of a publishing - house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications , become the fostering elements of a magazine 's growth . III The origin of Harper 's is especially interesting because it was the first of its class , having no predecessor in its type e. , in the type disclosed in its development as peculiarly its own . No group of writers was awaiting it , ready to occupy its pages with their brilliant contributiuns . It was an essential part of the organization of a great metropolitan publishing business , to all appearances a mere incident . Its real future no one could forecast , not even its publishers , who were also mainly its conductors . In its progress it was a series of surprises , the novelty of which piqued public curiosity . All the first appearances indicating its character were contradicted . It seemed like an eclectic , but was quickly transformed into something wholly native and original , intimately associated with the growth of the American people , especially in the novel aspects of its frontier life . It became an educational institution through its illustrated articles of travel , exploration , and science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American people ? its humors , its habits , its amusements , in near and remote regions , in the mountains of Virginia , and the mining-camps beyond the Rockies . Always the greatest novels of the time found place in its pages . The remarkable development which it stimulated in black and white drawing and engraving widened the field of its possibilities . In all this growth it maintained a deep and strong human appeal , with an intention not deliberately calculated or morally inculcated , but vital . IV There is a prevalent notion that the Magazine is made up from month to month from copy submitted in the shape of manuscripts by writers in all quarters of the globe , the selection and arrangement of these articles being committed to a responsible editor , who is a kind of Great . Mogul , crowning or decapitating literary aspirants at his sovereign will and pleasure . It is conceivable that a magazine might be thus eonstituted ? a monthly miscellany representing contributors and dependent wholly upon their good-will and ability ; and it would have a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small a portion of the present or of any other number is the result of selection from these casual offerings of manuscripts ; and , on the other hand , it would be impossible for him to overestimate the value of such contributions as arc selected . It would be an ideal situation for the Magazine if every article essential to it should be thus contributed , as ? other things being equal ? no solicited contribution has quite the value of one prepared by a writer of his own motion . Suppose there were but four or five contributions to the present number selected from casual offerings ? these few found things would , in many ways , seem more precious , especially if they came from new writers , than the other contents ; they are the promise of the future . Constance Fenimore Woolson and many other eminent writers were first discovered in this way . Everything goes to the making up of a living and growing magazine . In its magic mirror must be reflected the whole procession going down to Camelot . Notonly the great writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in literature and art and society , and the new discoveries in science , must he included in the view . The exclusions and eliminations for final choice as to the actual representation of this moving world in the pages of the Magazine proceed more in accordance with the genius of the Magazine itself than with the arbitrary determination of its conductors . There can , indeed , be nothing arbitrary in the conduct of such a magazine . It is a popular institution , engaging the earnest attention and interest not only of those directly concerned in its management , but of a large silent yet commanding constituency . If any member of this constituency breaks the silence , he has the authority of a tribune for the arrest of judgment . All counsels and suggestions from whatever source are not only heeded , but gratefully received . The management itself is , as we have said , modestly tentative . It must have single control , else there would be confusion , but that control proceeds through an association with itself of co-operative agencies . The editor 's direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether solicited or voluntarily contributed , with its very temperament and texture , and his sensibility to intimations from the genius and spirit of the Magazine itself ? a feeling of its very mould and pressure ? especially if it has been the culture of many years , give him his proper advantage , the only one , indeed , that he has over other co-operating agencies ; but it is fortunate for him if even in this he is not alone , if he can have not only sympathy and support from proprietor or manager , but that ideal fellowship which we imagine as having existed between such publishers as Murray and Blackwood and their editors , and which we know existed between Charles Scribner and Dr. J. G. Holland . Blackwood hardly needed an editor . James T. Fields edited the Atlantic Monthly himself during several years before he gave it into the charge of Mr. Howells , who alone could say how much he profited from the wisdom and experience of his predecessor . We ourselves have always had the benefit and inspiration of such fellowship . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expertness of judgment which comes of long habit . He fears lest he may overrate the expertness of writers also , or become insensible to fresh and simple creations . Therefore he courts the assistance of others , even in his exclusions , and especially the aid of younger minds and fresher eyes . We doubt if the readers of this Magazine know how complex are the operations upon which a single number depends for its full value and attractiveness . Outside of the central office , agencies are established in the great cities of Europe , simply for prompt information and suggestion . The illustrations for one number require the best work of a score of the ablest artists ? work that in the aggregate would occupy from a single hand nearly a year 's time , apart from the time taken to engrave them . The making - up of a number after its contents have been determined is a study , and might well occupy the entire time of one man ; in reality it is a matter of careful consultation , engaging the attention of manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person who has the special charge of it . All this is the mere body of a number ; its soul ? well , that is the soul the Magazine was born with , and which discloses itself more and more fully from year to year . V It is evident that magazines of the class we have been describing , while they become to a greater or less extent , according to their scope , popular institutions , can not without deterioration sacrifice a single essential feature for mere popularity . They arc not wholly business enterprises , any more than are our universities . They do not depend upon great names for their success . They have lived to little purpose if they have not won a greater prestige than can belong to any individual author , greater , that is , in their proper field . A book like Ben-llur may , in the course of years , have a far wider sale than any single copy of a magazine ever had , and be a really great book for all that ; but a book 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice in a century there may arise a writer whose works will live when all periodical literature contemporary with him shall be forgotten . English institutions may perish and Shakspere still live . But Shakspere or Milton or Goethe would poorly serve as a magazine contributor . Excepting the works of the masters of fiction , few , if any , great books lie within the proper scope of a periodical . Some stars that shine brilliantly in the reviews would have no proper place in a magazine galaxy . When you see a great name in a great magazine , it will not be because of its own desirability , but for the rare quality of the contribution itself , as in the case of Maurice Hewlett 's mediEeval romance in the present issue . The general demand makes it necessary to attach the names of authors to their contributions , but during more than half the period of its existence that was not the custom in this Magazine . It was safely assumed that the prestige of the Magazine would secure for the unknown writer his full share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters that demands the names of all contributors most eagerly fixes itself upon the offering of a new writer that in so sharp a competition has won a place . We will venture to say that Mary Applewhite Bacon 's short story , " The Passing of a Shadow , " in this number , will have as appreciative welcome as ; Mr. 011ivant 's , or Mr. Hewlett 's , or Miss Daskam 's . If our option lay between the field for the discovery and the disclosure ( ! of such productions by new writers and one in which we must forego that opportunity and service and yet might secure a monthly circulation of a million copies , we should hold to the former . There are many other ways in which the Magazine might be deflected from the lines of its proper destiny and be no longer itself , in which case its soul would leave the body and seek another incarnation . The lines of natural development are inevitable ; success achieved in other lines would be a magnificent diversion , but without significance . A magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the life of the people in the lines of that life 's aspiration and growth .
