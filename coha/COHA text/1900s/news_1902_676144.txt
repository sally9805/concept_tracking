txt A splendid . naval and military engagement  --  the mightiest " peace " battle ever waged between the two arms of the United States service ? took place at daybreak to-day in the vicinity of Great Gull Island , at the entrance to Long Island Sound . Four great battleships , the I ( earsarge , the Alabama , the Indiana , and the Massachusetts , one armored cruiser , the Brooklyn ; and one monitor , the Puritan , constituting the bulk of the fighting force of Rear Admiral Higginson , - the Commander in Chief of the " enemy 's forces ' , " made a determined and splendid effort to batter to pieces Fort Terry , on the southwestern end of Plum Island , the fortifications at Gardiner 's Point , constituting the extreme western end of Gardiner 's Island , and Fort Michie , on Great Gull Island . At the end of an hour 's fighting , during which the mimicry of actual war furnished an inspiring and magnificent spectacle , two of the most powerful fortifications that stand guard at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , wrecked , and the enemy had the situation so , completely at his mercy that he magnanimously abandoned for the time being his original intention of landing troops at the conquered forts , and thus the army commanders were spared the humil1 iation of handing over swords . His smoking vessels withdrew toward his advance base at Block Island , and it is believed that before the invader follows up his advantage by coming up the Sound , toward New York he will make an attack upon Newport and the entrance to Narragansett Bay . Newport has long been recognized as one of the most difficult strongholds in . Amerlea to break into , and it is known that the conquering Higginson has long cherished the ambition to conquer it . It is believed that the move on the stronghold , of wealth and power will be made almost immediately , possibly to-night . The ultimate result of to-day 's battle will not be exactly known until the various " umpires " on ship and on shore can meet together and work out the long and intricate problem in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hours , minutes , seconds , weight of projectiles , distance , and a hundred other quantities must be nicely a hundred other quantities that must be nicely weighed . Although from a spectacular and superficial standpoint the navy has won an overwhelming victory . it is yet to be learned that the army has gained no advantage in the great game . SEARCHLIGHTS INEFFECTIVE . One feature of the morning 's battle , however , stands out from all others , and that is that even with the most powerful search . lights sweeping the surrounding waters from the forts , vessels of an enemy can slip by the Long Island Sound fortifications with the utmost case unobserved . Higginson 's vessels had no trouble in getting within striking distance of the defenders , and it was the guns of his vessels this morning that gave the signal to battle . I That he was aided greatly by the weather 1 is admitted , for the dull haze that hung over the waters in the gray hours of the dawn , when the blow was struck , seemed almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shore , render .. 1 ing their great fingers of light misty and I uncertain . Although it is fairly certain that the vie ; tory of the enemy was decisive and went nigh overwhelming . the advance of the vici tor has not been without casualties , I as the Scorpion , one of his most efficient , : dispatch boats , was last night practically destroyed by running upon one of the theoretical hulks with which the channels in the vicinity of the Sound entrance are thickly planted . The Scorpion was on scout duty in the neignhoehoed of Gardiner 's island when she suddenly ran upon the : submerged hulk . Commander Bans ) ) was unaware of ? anything being wrong until one of the army umpires on board called attention to the fact that the bow of his vessel had been theoretically stove in and that she was in a sinking condition . Commander I Baush immediately put into Salt Bay for repairs . This morning 's great demonstration was the culmination of a move on the part of the enemy which began early yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There all day the formidable fleet of almost a score of vessels of all sorts tugged at their anchors . The big , , fighting ships instantly array Well out In Tie blue water , while the colliers , tenders , runboats , and tugs worked in and out of the harbor on all sorts of mysterious errands. - ? As the day Closed and night came on thick tad murky , it became evident that the enemy hailed the conditions- as propitious : or his contemplated deeds . All his vessels withdrew outside the harbor around a toleful bell buoy , and the first evidence of mpending trouble for somebody was heavy : clouds of black smoke rolling from the funleis of the cruiser Montgomery . ' There was a fluttering of signals , a Whistling of boatswains , a hoisting of boats , and just as night was drawing a curtain over sea and land and the harbor fights began to twinkle , the cruiser stole silently away from the ghostly company of nee/ . Whither she went is as yet a mys:ery , unless already some unprotected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruin of her guns . Ashore at a point of land jutting out into the neck of the harbor twinkled the camp tires of the marines of the alien forces , who had been landed to form the base . Here and there was the flare of a " wig wag " torch as word was passed ? from shore to sea . On the : rev reieets of the flagship Kearsarge there glowed almost , , onti  --  uouslY the strings of red and white Lights of the Ardais signaling system . Gradually the lights on all the ships Were extinguished save for those at bow and stern , and then the flashing Ardais bulbs had a background of inky black . Suddenly , about S o'ciock , the watchers perceived that two sets of these head and ; tern lights were missing from their aceustorned places . Then it ' was seen that two pairs of telltale lights were moving , passing out at the end of the line to the northward . The Brooklyn and Massachusetts were found to be missing from their places , They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before 2 o'clock the ; pies saw the gray banks of steel in the Dffing slipping away . There was not a sound , not a light except a single electric bulb . carefully masked , the stern light to guide the vessels following .. Out they slipped , one . two , three , four , nor in file , but in pairs , the flagship Indiana heading almost southwest , the AlaDama almost westward , while skulking tonderously behind was the squat form of he monitor Puritan . ENEMY ON THE MOVE . The enemy was on the move and now Drily the vigilance of the 4,000 soldier defenders ensconsed behind the fortifications along the threatened coast could save the country . The deadly company of fighting machines had gone but a few miles to sea in various directions when , by prezo  --  certed action , they fell in together and 5. ! t. a course west by north . In that direction , 35 miles away lay the chain of forts . /pen which the Nation depends to guard the Eastern approach to its greatest and richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the right and nearest to the unseen enemy gleamed at ii .. *ervals the eye of a gigantic searchlight mounted at Fort Mansfield an ' Watch Rill . On the Rhode Island coast gleamed the two searchlights of Fort H. 3 . Wright . These sheets of white crossed and recrossed en the waters and on the - sky. but their rays fell short . Higginson 's four vessels intended to strike further to the southward . They kept a straight course , by which they eventually brought up at Cerberus Shoals , about fifteen miles from Block Island . Here they were met by the New York naval militia boat Aileen , one of the enemy 's scouts , which had quietly slipped away from the fleet at Block Island in the afternoon with her crew of arch trailers and came here to spy out and buoy the mines and hulks with which the army had hoped to wreck a careless foe . The Aileen having given her aid to her superiors withdrew , for this was not to be a battle of a mosquito fleet . There was bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the lights were darting , and the enemy kept on . At 4:42 o'clock the Kearsarge passed within the 4.000 feet range of the Gardiner 's Point guns . This is the radius of action . Then Higginson , still undiscovered by the soldiers behind their guns , gave his orders to fire . A moment later from the ? starboard side of the great battleship there leaped a sheet of flame , and the thunder of the battle was on , THE ARMY 'S GUNS ARE HEARD . A moment later flame Ind smoke leaped from behind ridges of earth , and the inhabitants roundabout leaped to their windows with mighty little armor to see - what awful carnage was being theoretically inflicted . While engaged with Gardiner 's Point the attacking squadron came within - the field of fire of Fort Michie on Great Gull Island to the north and the shore batteries opened a. vigorous fire . The invader , however , passed within three minutes to the south and west out of the field of fire without the loss of a vessel . a was then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire from Gardiner 's Point was weak . It was his idea to effect a landing on the south side of Plum Island and send a landing force across to attack Fort Terry on the northwestern side . But here he met with a great surprise . There was grim silence on shore as the attacking vessels opened fire to pave the way for a landing , but suddenly there ' belched forth sheets of flame and smoke from a score of points that had been thought inoffensive fields . Here were fortifications that the enemy had never known of . and for a time there was a fire so galling sent across the channel that the squadron was threatened . At this point , however , came in turn the results of the invader 's master stroke . There was a hail of shot suddenly hurled upon Fort Terry on the other side of the Island . and with the sound the army commanders realized their doom . The cruiser Brooklyn and battleship Massachusetts . ; which had left the fleet at Block Island early in the evening had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the : coast and made their way into the Sound through the Race between Race Rock and Valiant Rock under the very guns and searchlights of the powerful Fort H. G. Wright , and had come around on the north side of Flub Island . where they opened fire lust as the Nearsarge . Alabama . and Inliana opened up on the south side . The scene of battle at a distance was a ? magnificent spectacle , and it required little Imagination to picture the scenes of death and destruetion on sea and land . There resounded the din of almost hundreds of guns . There was the leaping of flame from the mouth of great guns and the rolling clouds of powder smoke . Four times the squadron of attacking ressels ? at the south of Plum Island passed before the fortifications and worked all of their guns , the traitorous militiamen from Massachusetts , Connecticut . add New York working the small guns of the enemy 's batteries with telling effect . PURITAN APPEARS ON THE SCENE . At this time the Puritan , which had been lagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns . Then all the guns were turned on Plum Island , with particular attention being paid to the rapid-fire batteries guarding the searchlights . These were " put out of action " in forty minutes and attention was directed to the guns protecting the mortar batteries . These were put out of action by 5:14 o'clock . Then the main section of the squadron again directed some of its guns to Gardiner 's Point . and at 4:55 o'clock , thirteen minutes after the firing began , the Point e as reduced . It had required 10,000 Points ? ' to effect this . Higginson did not press his advantage , however , but . deziding that sufficient results had been aczomplfshed for one day , withdrew his fleet and went to Cerberus Shoals and went to preakfast If , as is claimed by the navy , he put out ) .77 action the fortifications about Plum Gut a : means that he can now pass down Long ! eland Sound to Willet 's Point . where he will encounter Forts Schuyler and Slocum .

It a-lay be months before it is known officially whether the Massachusetts does or does not exist .
