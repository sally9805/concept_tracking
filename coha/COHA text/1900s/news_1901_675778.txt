txt Wreathed in smoke and emitting jagged tongues of flame from her forward hatches , the full-rigged ship Commodore T. H. Allen was slowly toweV. across the waters just outside New . York Harbor yesterday afternoon . ' Laden with 800,000 gallons of oil belonging to I he Standard Oil Company , she had started early in the morning for Hongkong , and it was When she was off the entrance of Gedney Channel , before the tug James A. Lawrence had left off towing her , that the crew of twenty-four men were dumfounded to see coming from her aft hatches great ' masses of smoke . This was shortly after 1 o'cloca in the afternoon , and more than tour hours passed before the ' scuttled hull of the once fine vessel was beached inside the-bar at Sandy Hcok . Not a man of the crew was injured .

Before deserting the ship , however , ahe men , acting under orders from Capt . Robert Merriman , remained at their posts for half an hour , , endeavoring to discover the cause of the fire and . to extjnguish the flames which raged down in ; the hold . It was not until an the stationary pumps had proved of no avail that the . Captain bade everybody board the tug . He was the last man to leave the deck , saying to his men as they hurried down the sides : " Be easy there . If you are going to get blown up , you are going to . That 's all there is to it . No use being in a hurry . " The smoke that issued from the burning vessel was seen from the Sandy Hook Lightship , and the observatories of Quarantine and the Highlands . Many small boats , too , saw it , and within a few minutes after it began to pour from the hatches the pilot boat New York ran along side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Merriman gave his order to vacate , and the crew crawled down the sides . Then the tug Hallenbeck steamed up , answering a distress signal that had been hoisted by the crew before they abandoned . their ship .

As the little , fleet of rescuers hove to around the doomed " oil ship , the ' thick clouds of black Smoke became so enormous that even the outlines of the group of craft were indistinguishable at times . All the while the agents of the ship , Elwell &; Co. of 17 State-Street , answered inquiries about the fire in this wise : " There is no danger . The smoke seen on the vessel comes from her dummy engine . There is no serious fire aboard . " From all the coast points where a view of the disaster could be gotten crowds of people watched the mass of smoke .

When the fireboat arrived the Lawrence . and the Hallenbeck were pulling the Allen by means of long cables .

The tug was just about to cut loose from us , and we had hoisted our topsails , forestaysail , and . jib . When we first saw the smoke , it was coming up the main hatch aft , and we thought for a few minutes that it was a little fire that we could put out quickly . For half an hour we fought it . The hand pumps were played into the hatches for all they were worth , but it was no go , and at last Capt . Merriman told us to leave . He was a cool one , I can tell you .

Most of us got on the Lawrence , but some took to the other boats that had come up by this time . The women were in a high flutter . There was n't any immediate danger from the fire itself , as long as it staid a fire . but if it had changed into an explosion there would have - been the devil to pay . But we soon stopped thinking about that , and the officers told us , to bore some holes into the side of the ship and pump eater into her that way .

" Just a little while after the agents had admitted the existence of a serious fire , after the fireboat and police patrol boat had started to render tardy assistance , the towing tugs beached the Allen inside Sandy Hook . There she rested last night on a shoal , with only a , few feet of her charred hulk showing above the surface . At a late hour the boat was still burning . The vessel 's galley and other deck houses had been destroyed by the flames . but the spars , rigging , &c.; had not caught fire . The crew came to the city on the fishing boat Atlantic City . The rescued men , when seen after their ' landing-. were thanking all the saints ' of the sea for their timely delivery , but there was not lacking a tone of regret for having masse* a . long voyage on good pay .
