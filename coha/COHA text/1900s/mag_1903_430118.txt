 |p657  MOUNTAINEERING in North Al America is still in its infancy ? that is , mountaineering in its fullest sense , over crags , precipices , glaciers , and eternal snows , as in the European Alps , the cradle of the art . Far be it from me to disparage any work of nature or to despise the climbs of countless numbers on lower or easier peaks . The ranges of the Eastern States have sylvan beauties unsurpassed , and , with their loftier brethren of the Colorado Rockies and California Sierra , afford ? rand views and much exhilarating exercise ; and , grander still , the splendid snowcrowned , glacier-hung monarchs of the Western coast , ? Mounts Shasta , Rainier , and others , ? and , in the distant North , Mount St. Elias , Mount Logan , and kin ' . red giants in their arctic realms , offer the further experience of snow and ice : but for the climber who desires the best the ontinent provides , the Dominion of Can .. , la must be sought , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; round " rivaling Switzerland awaits his prowess . Rivaling truly , for , albeit in ac'sal difficulty of climbing few of the known Canadian peaks compare with those of Switzerland , the possibility of a " first ascent , " so dear to the heart of a mountaineer , but now almost a relic of a bygone age in Europe , is presented on every hand , with the addition of miles and miles of territory quite unknown and unexplored , containing countless lofty virgin peaks and lovely valleys yet untrodden . The most famous of the Canadian mountains hitherto has been the mighty monolith named Mount Assiniboine by Dr. Dawson , and styled " the Matterhorn of the Rockies " by reason of its striking resemblance to the world-famed Swiss peak . Its massive pyramid forms a conspicuous landmark from almost every considerable eminence for many a mile around , towering fully 1500 feet above its neighbors , and by its isolation no less than by its splendid outline commanding attention . It bears also a secondary resemblance to its prototype from the fact of its having repelled more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained a reputation for inaccessibility from every side save possibly one . It was largely in the endeavor to disprove this latter statement that the expedition was undertaken as here chronicled . The inception of the enterprise occurred at Mr. Edward Whymper 's camp-fire in the Upper Yoho Valley , near Field , British Columbia ( one of the most picturesque of valleys to be found in any land , with its mirror lakes , exquisite waterfalls , and mighty glaciers set in a frame of rugged peaks ) . The disappointing news had just arrived of the failure of Messrs . Wilcox and Bryant 's last attempt to climb Mount Assiniboine , and a stronger desire than ever to examine and , if possible , ascend the mountain came to me ; but the distance and the expense made the undertaking seem too great , till Peyto , our head packer , offered to take me to the base within two  |p658  days , and asserted his conviction that I could undoubtedly achieve success . So a compact was made upon the spot , if opportunity should offer , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , I found myself unemployed and the weather fine , but showing indications of the break which comes annually about this date , bringing a snow-storm to usher in September . It was now or never for this season , so I resolved to make a dash for the peak before the snow should render it impossible , and Peyto being able to guide us , a start upon the following day was determined on . Provisions , blankets , etc. , were rapidly collected , and in the afternoon my guides and I were on the train bound for Banff . Here we were met by Peyto and conducted to our tent , pitched among the bushes near the bank of the Bow River . The morning of the 31st of August was occupied in final arrangements , ? making up packs , etc. , ? and at half-past one our procession started . First , Bill Peyto , picturesque and workmanlike , leading the way upon his trusty mare ; then followed four specially selected packhorses laden with tents , provisions , and our miscellaneous impedimenta ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing up the rear , to stimulate laggards and maintain the pace . Then came , on foot , Christian Hasler of Interlaken , and Christian Bohren of Grindelwald , Swiss guides who had been stationed by a railway company at Field , and myself . Mount Assiniboine is only about twenty miles distant from Banff in an air-line , yet by the shortest route it can not be reached in twice that length of march . But all of us were keen , and determined to do our best to make the journey to its base a record and the expedition a success . The afternoon was sultry , with a haze about the summits and a look toward the west that boded rain ; but the barometer stood well , and hope was high . At first we passed along the dusty road , with the cool , peaceful Bow eddying alongside , hemmed in by green banks , with overhanging branches dipping lazily in the current . Then we turned off into a winding trail that meandered among alders and small timber , with fallen logs and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impressive walls of Cascade Mountain ; on our right , across the valley , the sharp pinnacles of Edith Peak pierced the sky ; and wooded slopes flanked us on the left , and rose to the fine summit of Mount Massive right in front . Soon we reached Healy Creek , emerging from a narrow gorge , and crossed its double stream , the pedestrians having to clamber up behind the horsemen to make the passage . Leaving the broad , level valley of the Bow , and with it every trace of civilization for many a day to come , we plunged into the ravine , beside the swift , translucent river , until we mounted a very steep trail through thick forest , and emerged high above the creek in a fine valley whence the retrospective views were very beautiful . Our path led through a tract of burned and fallen timber to more open ground , trending steadily toward Simpson Pass , above which stood a gabled mountain , with a small glacier cradled on its bosom , against a gloomy , ominous background of dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well wooded near the torrent-bed . On one side rugged summits rose abruptly from the thickly timbered slopes ; on the other , the more open alps , interspersed with belts and groves of trees , bare cliffs and rocky terraces , merged into castellated peaks , the topmost crowned with snow . As the evening shadows lengthened , before our camping-ground was reached , strong gusts of wind came sweeping down the gorge , with driving rain beating pitilessly in our faces , and we pressed on until we found a pretty and fairly sheltered spot among the woods , where we pitched our tent . Next morning we were off at half-past seven , in fair weather , though the trees and undergrowth were dripping , crossed the stream , and after twenty minutes ' gradual ascent diverged from the main trail to Simpson Pass , and followed a steep pathway to the south through thick pines up a narrow rocky valley , till we attained a beautiful open park . The timber-line was passed soon after , and our route lay along a breezy , undulating alp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent pretty lakelets in the hollows . Ever and anon a deep canon dipped sharply toward the east or west , giving a glimpse of larger . wooded valleys , where Healy Creek and  |p659  Simpson River run to join the Bow and Kootenay , and finally sink into the waters of the rival oceans . About ten o'clock , from a lofty ridge about 2000 feet above our camp , we caught our first glimpse of Mount Assiniboine , bearing from this point a remarkable resemblance to the Swiss Dent Blanche , as it loomed through the slight haze , fourteen or fifteen miles away , dwarfing all the other points and ranges . An hour later , from the highest point upon our upland trail , some 7700 feet above the sea , we obtained a still better view of its noble pyramid , towering above a blue-black ridge hung with white glaciers , which lies between us and its base . Crossing and recrossing the backbone of the continent , we skirted the base of an imposing natural fortification , 2000 feet high , and passing under its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small lakes , we halted for lunch near a round pond , from which some ducks flew off at our approach , and which , from the numerous tracks leading in and out of it , we christened " The Bears ' Bath-tub . " All this time the going had been good , and Peyto made the most of it , leading at a tremendous rate , with Sinclair driving on the pack-animals , and we , on foot , doing our best to keep pace with them . After lunch a new experience began ? a tremendous descent ( 1500 feet in fifty-five minutes ) into an extraordinarily steep and weird valley , narrow and fire-swept , its , , erried ranks of bare and ghostly poles backed by the slopes of scanty grass and the expanse of rough gray rocks and tongues of scree . Toward its lower end we encountered an intricate maze of fallen logs , through which Peyto steered the horses with marvelous skill and rapidity , until we gained the valley of the chief source of the Simpson River , barren and boulder-strewn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to side . Bare , burned trees reared their gaunt stems about us , or , fallen , littered the valley-bed , where strawberries and raspberries , gooseberries and bluebernes. grew in wild profusion . Crossing several ridges , we soon arrived at the head of the valley , a cul-de-sac , with a grand amphitheater of precipices and abrupt acclivities , 300 feet or more height , blocking our way , and towering above the rich green flat on which we rested , beside a tree-girt lakelet , fed by a fine cascade that leaped from the rim of the great cirque above . A zigzag track conducted us to the lowest point of this great barrier , and a scene of indescribable bleakness burst upon our gaze . The sun was hidden by the gathering clouds , and the leaden sky formed a fit background for the rock-bound basin at our feet , hemmed in by gray , ruined towers , from which wide belts and tapering tongues of tumbled scree streamed down among the bare poles of the stricken pines , with a tiny tarn , somber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting prelude to the long valley on which we now entered . Here was the acme of sheer desolation . Green-gray rocks and stones were strewn and piled in wild confusion amid sparse , stunted pines ; crumbling drab-colored side-hills were lost in jagged , broken ridges and shattered pinnacles , that loomed in sullen dullness against the mournful sky , while a light drizzle bathed the scene in gloomy haze . Here and everywhere along our route the dreary silence and the strange scarcity of living things ? a notable characteristic of the Canadian Cordilleras ? were very striking . The whistle of the marmot , the rare whir of grouse , an eagle and a little bird or two , and a few tracks of bear or/deer , marten or mountain goat , alone betrayed that the region is not quite bereft of life . So we swung along mile after mile , till the melancholy conditions began to change : grass and light undergrowth appeared , the clouds broke , and , as we neared a rocky lake , Mount Assiniboine came into view again about five miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evening gloom , showing some detail of its horizontal belts of cliff and smooth , shining icy slopes . Then came park country , rich green pasturage , and dark forest belts , with a winding coal-black stream-bed meandering through it all ; while overhead sharp , serrated ridges , severed by wide passes to the Spray and Cross rivers , converged in the mass of Mount Assiniboine . At length , at twenty minutes past seven , we reached our chosen camping-ground , sheltered by a grove of trees beside a trickling rivulet , with the dark waters of a long lake just visible beyond . This lake , one of a dozen or more that  |p660  lie close under the precipices of the giant peak , is nearly two miles long , and , like many others in the neighborhood , without a visible outlet . The waters seem to drain away through the loose limestone strata , and in some valley far below suddenly spring forth from a mysterious subterranean outlet , a full-grown stream . The night was none too promising ? warm and cloudy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although later on the stars came out , ominous clouds still hung heavy round the horizon . The silence was broken again and again by the rumble and crash of falling ice and stones from the glacier a mile away , which aided the anxiety about the weather prospects to drive the slumber from our wearied frames . Next morning we were astir early , the moon shining fitfully athwart the clouds and lighting up our grand peak with silvery brightness . As the sun rose , we had an opportunity of studying the mountain . Our camp , at an elevation of about 7200 feet , lay near the shore of the lake , a long mile from the cliff over which the northern glaciers of Mount Assiniboine descend abruptly ; 3000 feet above the glacier rises the mighty monolith , a relic of the carboniferous age . Two jagged ridges trend sharply upward from the outlying spurs , until they meet in a dark , rocky apex just below the glistening , snowy summit ; between them lies the formidable northern face , set at a fearsome angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impressive alternation of perpendicular cliff belts and glassy slopes of ice . The lowest band is specially remarkable ? a spectacular , striated wall of brilliant red-and-yellow rock , running apparently entirely round the mountain , and particularly striking where the erosion and disintegration of the ridges leave a succession of colored spires and pinnacles , radiant in the glowing sunshine . The mountaineering history of Mount Assiniboine can be briefly sketched . Three times at least the citadel has been assailed . In 1899 Messrs . H. G. Bryant of Philadelphia and L. J. Steele , an Englishman , reconnoitered it by the northwest arete , but were repulsed at an altitude of about 10,000 feet . The following summer two Chicago climbers with three Swiss guides attempted the ascent by the north face . bet failed to scale the first great line of cliffs . Again in August , 1901 , Mr. Bryant a further attack , in company with MG W. D. Wilcox of Washington and the S guide Edward Feuz . Mr. Bryant Feuz had already been upon the mountain and Mr. Wilcox , the historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the precincts of Assiniboine.i Their knowledge of the peak led them to try the southwest ridge and face , the obviously most promising line of approach ; but the condition of the snow was such that fear of avalanches and lack of time drove them back when about 1000 feet below the crest . The fortress thus remained inviolate , the eastern side a precipice , the southern equally impracticable of ascent , the northern deemed probably inaccessible , and the southwest side , its most vulnerable aspect , strongly guarded . By the advice of Peyto , who had made the circuit of the mountain with Messrs . Wilcox and Bryant in 1899 , we had arranged to make our attempt on this southwest side ; but , instead of taking horses and camp by the long detour necessary to reach the base , a two days ' trip , we determined to endeavor to find a way round on foot , across the flanking spurs , at a high altitude . Being wholly unaware of the character of the mountain on the farther side , and anticipating considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had little expectation of reaching the summit in a single day , and planned to camp somewhere at the farther side and make our assault on the following day . So at 6 A.M. we started off , ? Peyto , Hasler , Bohren , and I , ? laden with two days ' provisions , changes of raiment , blankets , and a light tent for the night , besides the usual camera and sundry other paraphernalia . Twenty minutes ' walk along the green flat brought us to the first snow , and a steep pull up hard snow-slopes and a craggy wall of rock , followed by an awkward scramble over loose debris , landed us at half-past seven on the ice above . The glacier , covered with congealed snow and thin moraine , stretched away before us at an easy angle , with the great peak  |p661  towering aloft on our left . Forty minutes of rapid going took us to the crest of the sharp ridge which forms the sky-line to the west and merges in the main northwest arete . Two hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a second pass , at the base of the great , western ridge . Dropping down to the ice , we followed it up , zigzagging to avoid the large crevasses , to the summit of the narrow pass , which we reached at nine o'clock and found ourselves about 9600 feet above the sea and 2400 feet above the camp . From this point the lower portion of the unknown side of our mountain lay in full view , and , to our joy , we saw that our anticipated difficulties were non-existent . A comparatively easy traverse , along narrow but ample ledges covered with snow and debris , across the ribs and stony gullies of the southwest face , would bring us , with scarcely any loss of elevation , to the southwest ridge , whence the climb proper would begin . But , to counteract this piece of good fortune , the light , fleecy clouds which had been hovering over the lower western peaks and growing larger and denser every hour were blotting out the view , and soon enveloped us in their chill embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless made our way to the ridge , where we " cached " our blankets , tent , and most of the provisions , and , after a second breakfast , continued our upward progress at about half-past ten . Our circle of vision dwindled from one hundred yards to fifty at the most ; a steady drizzle , mingled with sleet , began to fall as we climbed cliff and ledge and gully , loose rocks and slopes of debris , as each appeared through the mists in front of us ; and every few yards we built a little pile of stones to guide us in returning . At length , at about 10,750 feet altitude , out of the gloom a mighty wall , seventy or eighty feet in height , loomed before us , its top lost in the clouds . The face seemed sheer and actually overhung in places . None of us had ever seen this side of Mount Assiniboine , excepting Peyto , who had left us a short distance below to prospect for minerals , and we knew not where the summit lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Imagining that this belt was as unbroken here as on the northern face , we sought a cleft up which to clamber , and skirted the base to the right , till we were brought up by a tremendous precipice , some 6000 feet in depth . We had suddenly reached the edge of a gigantic buttress , where its converging sides meet at an abrupt angle . Before us , and on each hand , was empty space , and at our feet a seemingly unbroken drop thousands of feet in depth . Behind rose the sharp edge of rock like polished masonry . Below the stone-strewn ledge by which we had approached , the mountainside shelved to the south in rugged steepness into far-distant depths ; and as we peered with caution round the angle , the farther side disclosed a most appalling face of black , forbidding precipice , one of the finest and most perpendicular it has been my lot to see . Here for some moments I stood in solemn awe , perched like a statue in a lofty niche , cut in the topmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , on each side , above , and below , the yawning deeps lost in the wreathing mists that wrapped the mountain 's base . Our progress in this direction barred , we now retraced our steps and spied a little rift by which , in spite of a fair overhang for the first twelve or fifteen feet , thanks to firm hand- and foot-holds , we were enabled to scramble to the summit of the cliff . Working to the left by a steep succession of ledges and clefts , we reached a narrow , broken ridge running upward from the west , with a sheer drop upon the farther side . We thought that we had struck the main western arete ( for it is very difficult to locate one 's self in a dense mist , especially on an absolutely unknown mountain ) and followed its lead , till in ten minutes , to our great amazement , we found ourselves upon a peak ! Narrow ridges descended to the east and west , the steep face of our ascent lay to the south , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpendicularly for thousands of feet , broken only by a short buttress , with equally sheer walls and edged with jagged pinnacles . This " Lost Peak " was to us most mysterious . It seemed a genuine summit , narrow and pointed though it was , in altitude a trifle over 11,000 feet . Yet where upon the mass of Mount Assiniboine was such a peak ? We had imagined that the  |p662  giant tooth rose more or less symmetrically on every side , and judged the back ridge by our knowledge of the four which we had seen . Hasler at first insisted that we were on the veritable summit , but the elevation and configuration of our whole environment demolished such a theory . We strained our eyes ; but , though the breeze kept the thick clouds in constant motion , we could not see more than about a hundred yards ahead . We shouted in this direction and in that , but our voices died away into space until at last held by some loftier mass , which echoed back an answer from the direction whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were standing upon the southeast ridge , which must be longer and less steep , at any rate in its upper portion , than any of the others , and possess a distinct minor peak , separated from the main summit by a considerable break . Such proved to be the case . After an hour spent in cold and wet , striving to pierce the clouds , hoping some stronger current of wind might waft them off , and thus enable us to see the top and give us some idea of its character and how we might approach it , we built a " stone man " to commemorate our visit , and , at halfpast one , returned along the west arete until a chasm yawned beneath our feet ? how deep we could not tell ( it proved about 200 feet ) ? and forced us to descend by our cliff route and down the crack to the base of the big wall . A few minutes ' walking in the opposite direction brought us to a broad snow-couloir , where the cliff receded and trended upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above not long before , and away upon our left stretched the steep face of the great peak itself . It was now too late to think of climbing farther , so we descended rapidly , and rejoined Peyto near the cache . Here , during a meal , we held a council of war , and came to the unanimous determination to shoulder our packs and return to camp ; feeling that , if the morrow were wet , we should be better off there , and if it were fine , it would take but little longer to come round in light marching order from the north than to make the ascent thus far with heavy packs from tree-line on the south . In spite of a very speedy return , night fell upon us before we had quite descended the cliff wall below the northern glacier , and we stumbled into camp in black darkness about a quarter past eight . The clouds had begun to dissipate toward sunset ; later on the moon rose in a clear , star-spangled sky ; and the chill of frost augured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable date for us and Mount Assiniboine , dawned brilliantly . At ten minutes past six our little party of three set out from camp in the best of spirits , encouraged by the hearty good wishes of the packers , and made rapid progress by the route of the previous day . In two and a half hours we were on the second pass , enjoying this time a wide view to the south and the northwest of an ex panse of indented mountain-ranges and deep yawning valleys , with a little lake far below in each gorge . A brief halt here , and then on to the southwest ridge , reaching the cache three and a quarter hours from the start . Upward , past the colored belt , to our great cliff of yesterday . There , at half-past ten , we turned off to the left and crossed the couloir , full of deep snow upon an icy basis . Beyond it lay the final 1000 feet of the great mountain , its steep and rugged face a series of escarpments , broken by tiny ledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by clefts and crevices almost vertical . Slopes of solid ice or ice-hard snow , demanding arduous step-cutting , intervened below each wall and ledge and filled each cavity . The rocks were very brittle and extremely insecure , and to the ordinary difficulties there was added that abomination of the mountaineer , verglas , the thin coating of ice upon the rocks from the night 's frost after the rain and sleet of yesterday . The general line was diagonally across the face , but frequent minor consultations were required , the problems of immediate procedure being numerous . Steadily onward the little party made its cautious way across these difficult approaches : ever on the alert , hand and foot alike pressed into service ; each hold fully tested before the weight was trusted to it . A slippery ledge demanded an ignominious crawl ; a series of gymnastic efforts were required to surmount some of the straightup rocks and buttresses , where holds were few and far between . Detours were frequent to avoid impossible conditions : all  |p663  sorts of cracks and crevices had to be utilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenues of access to the tops of smooth , unbroken cliffs . Thus step by step the advance continued , till , after a final scramble up a gully lined with solid ice and almost as steep and narrow as a chimney , we stood triumphantly upon the south arete , the summit in full view not more than 300 feet above us , reached by an easy ridge of snow , and Mount Assiniboine we knew was ours ! The strangest part of our ascent lay in the fact that now for the first time we saw the actual summit , as we had never had an opportunity of prospecting the mountain from the side of our ascent , and its cliffs rose so steeply during our approach that we could never see more than a short distance beyond us . White , vaporous clouds had been slowly drifting up for the last hour , and , fearing a repetition of the previous day 's experience and the loss of our view , we hurried on to the top , pausing only a few moments to enjoy the panorama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now 500 feet below us , and to take a picture through the mist of the white summit , with its splendid eastern precipice . A quarter of an hour sufficed to complete our victory , and at half-past twelve we stood as conquerors 11,860 feet above the sea ( government survey altitude from distant bases ) , on probably the loftiest spot in Canada on which human foot has been planted . The summit is a double one , crowned with ice and snow , the two points rising from the extremities of an almost level and very narrow ridge 150 feet in length , at the apex of the sharp aretes from north and south . On the western side snowslopes tilted downward at a very acute angle , while on the east a stupendous precipice was overhung by a magnificent succession of enormous cornices , from which a fringe of massive icicles depended . One at a time , ? the other two securely anchored , ? we crawled with tile utmost caution to the actual highest point , and peeped over the edge of the huge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining glacier 6000 feet or more below . The view on all sides was remarkable , although the atmosphere was somewhat hazy , and unsuitable for panoramic photography . Perched high upon our isolated pinnacle , full 1500 feet above the loftiest peak for many miles around , below us lay unfolded range after range of brown-gray mountains , patched with snow and sometimes glacier-hung , intersected by deep chasms or broader wooded valleys . A dozen lakes were visible , nestling between the outlying ridges of our peak , which proudly stands upon the backbone of the continent and supplies the head-waters of three rivers , the Cross , the Simpson , and the Spray . Far away to the northwest , beyond Mount Ball and the Vermilion Range , we could descry many an old friend among the mountains of the railroad belt : Mount Goodsir and the Ottertails , Mount Stephen and Mount Temple , with the giants of the Divide , Victoria , Lefroy , Hungabee , and many others , a noble group of striking points and glistening glaciers . The main ridge northward , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred yards or so , and then takes a wild pitch down to the glaciers at the mountain 's base . When we arrived at this point ( only through my insistence , for the guides were anxious to return at once the way we came ) , we looked down on the imposing face that is perhaps Assiniboine 's most characteristic feature . On our right the drop is perpendicular , a mighty wall with frequent overhanging strata and a pure snow-curtain hanging vertically beneath the crowning cornice . But the north face , though not so sheer or awesome , is perhaps still more striking and unique . The shining steeps of purest ice , the encircling belts of time-eroded cliffs , sweep downward with tremendous majesty . Between the two a ragged ridge is formed , narrow and broken , like a series of roughly fractured wall-ends . As we gazed , the question passed round , " Could we not manage to get down this way ? " and the hope of crowning the triumph by a traverse of the mountain , conquering its reputed inaccessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , together with the prospect of an absolutely first-class climb , decided the reply in the affirmative . True , at least three great bands of rock lay there below us , any one of which might prove an insurmountable obstacle and  |p664  necessitate a retracing of our footsteps , with the probable consequence of a night out , at a considerable altitude , among the icy fastnesses ; but we had found some crack or cranny heretofore in their courses on the farther side , and ? well , we would try to find an equally convenient right of way on this face , too . So , after a halt of nearly two hours , at twenty minutes past two we embarked upon our final essay . Well roped and moving generally one at a time , we clambered downward foot by foot , now balancing upon the narrow ridge , 5000 feet of space at our right hand ; then scrambling down a broken wall-end , the rocks so friable that hand-hold after handhold had to be abandoned , and often half a dozen tested before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge became too jagged or too sheer , making our cautious way along a tiny ledge or down the face itself , clinging to the cold buttresses , our fingers tightly clutching the scant projection of some icy knob , or digging into small interstices between the rocks ; anon , an ice-slope had to be passed with laborious cutting of steps in the hard , walllike surface ; and again , cliff after cliff must be reconnoitered , its slippery upper rim traversed until a cleft was found and a gymnastic descent effected to the icebound declivity that fell away beneath its base . For close upon 2000 feet the utmost skill and care were imperative at every step ; for scarcely half a dozen could be taken , in that distance , where an unroped man who slipped would not inevitably have followed the rejected hand-holds and debris that hurtled down in leaps and bounds , to crash into fragments on the rocks and boulders far below . But with a rope a careful party of experienced mountaineers is absolutely free from danger ; and though it took our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 1800 feet , our confidence was fully justified , for nothing insurmountable obstructed our advance , and , after a brief halt below the last cliff wall , a gay descent , on snow that needed no stepcutting , brought us soon after six o'clock to easier , continuous rocks , where we unroped . A speedy spell swinging down rocks , with an occasional glissade , landed us on the glacier in forty minutes , and an hour later , in the gathering darkness , we approached the camp , after an absence of thirteen and a half hours , greeted by shouts of welcome and congratulation from Peyto and Sinclair , who had seen us on the summit , and strains of martial music from the latter 's violin . Before turning in , we took a last look at the splendid obelisk above us , radiant in the moonlight against the dark , starstrewn canopy of heaven . A last look it proved , for next morning we awoke to a white world , with nothing visible of Mount Assiniboine but an occasional glimpse , through sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the freshly fallen snow . The return journey was begun at one o'clock that afternoon , and Desolation Valley was traversed in the snow and rain , and we encamped in the flat pasture at the head of Simpson Valley . Next day we made a most tremendous march in the teeth of a driving snow-storm . The valley , with its gaunt , spectral treetrunks , was drearier and more weird than ever ; the blackened timber , outlined against the snow , showed in a mazy network ; the bushes , with their load of fruit , peeped out forlornly amid their wintry environment , and every flower bore a tiny burden on its drooping head . The steep ascent of 1500 feet was made in everdeepening snow , and on the alp above we met the fierce blasts of the keen north wind , sweeping across the unprotected uplands . Wearied with our forced marches and two long days of arduous climbing , the tramping through the soft , drifting snow , the steady upward trend of our advance , and the hard conflict with the driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final ridge and descended to calmer regions through the dark , snow-laden pines . Still on we went , down H ealy Creek to the Bow Valley , where the packers camped with their tired horses , and the guides and I tramped on two hours more to Banff , arriving there just five days and five hours from the time of our departure . Our toils were over . Next morning we were again in our comfortable quarters at Field , well satisfied . In spite of adverse weather conditions , the expedition had been intensely interesting from start to  |p666  finish , and more than a success from a climber 's ' point of view ; and the fact that the ascent was made upon the last possible day the weather would permit that season added an extra spice of satisfaction to the accomplishment of a mountaineering feat perhaps the most sensational yet achieved in North America .
