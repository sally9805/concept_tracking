txt It was a great clay for Councilman Forey and for Judge Divver . For the people of the Second Assembly District , without distinction as to age , it was a tremendous occasion all around . For weeks they have looked forward to it . For days they have talked about it , and yesterday the constituents of the two men , who are making a bitter fight for the leadership of the east side district , drank of the cup of happiness that comes to those who are so far favored as to have politcal affiliations that need expression in vigorous fashion . Nob/ all of them " drew bids " for the chowder and dinner . If every man who has " talked politics " in the district these few weeks past had done so even the two big steamboats and the extra barges would not hare begun to hold them . But the next best thing to going torthe " feed " was to see the start . They might march in the parade , the colors of their favorite proudly adorning coat lapels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from standing On the sidewalk to shout while the others passed by ? Decidedly not . This is a free country , and Labor Day is an excuse for anything but labor . And shout they did lustily , without fear , or favor , each for the man of his choice . Some had no choice . But they just shouted anyhow . For what 's the use of a. ? plentti if any one must keep quiet ? A COUNT OF FACTIONS . But to the men who are in politics for something more than fun the day meant more . Up to yesterday , though both sides made claims , nobody felt absolutely certain about numbers or leaders . Now- the line has been drawn . There was still some doubt in a few minds as to just whom big Tim Sullivan would support . That meant that little Tim was a dark horse , too . So , ' when the portly form of Councilman Foley appeared moving toward the Roosevelt Street pier , with Senator Sullivan and Sullivan the younger in his train , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . " Big Tim 's wid us , " shouted a man in a white Fedora hat , with vigor . " How kin we lose ? " " We ca n't , " came the answer from a hundred throats , " Paddy Divver wo n't be in the runnin ' . " Mr. Foley smiled the smile of a man who is satisfied with himself and with life in general . He had a showing that would have pleased any candidate . At least 4,000 strong , his followers marched with him , and the cheers were deafening . Everywhere there was color . It was not only the Stars and Stripes that did honor to the day . The green flag , with the harp , fluttered from many windows , and banners and drapings of green hung from door posts and housetops . But there were German flags , too , and at one point the yellow flag of the Chinese , with the big dragon , fluttered in the breeze . " It 's hard times , sure , when they 've got to muster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divverite at sight of the emblem . As for the Italians , they seemed to be pretty well divided . The name of Divver and of Foley alternated on the lips of men whose dialect had a soft Sicilian flavor . The Divverites were especially rejoiced at the fact that they had 300 Italians in their parade , led by Charlie Bacigalupo , the Chinatown undertaker . He , too , has been a doubtful quantity , but he came out squarely for the present leader yesterday , and there was unrestrained joy in consequence . And if it needed anything more to make roseate the hopes of the Divverites there was the presence of Snator Ahearn . " Say , ai n't we got the boys , eh ? " said one of Judge Divver 's friends . " I guess yes . Look at that bunch . ' Humpty ' Hanover , the Mayor of Avenue C ; Judge Bolte Senator Featherson , Larry Delmouri There 's shinin ' lights fer yer . " " Yes , " interrupted another enthusiast , " and ai n't I just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ' " Go on , yer kiddin ' me . They did n't shake hands with me . " The expressed doubt almost caused a fight , but the dispute was patched up . The Foley party boarded the steamboat Magenta at Roosevelt Street and the overflow crowd went in a barge . At about the same time the Divverites were crowding . 2,500 strong , into the steamboat Isabella and a barge at the foot of Market Street . Both sides carried innumerable banners , and the line of march was punctuated with every kind of ear-splitting , noise-making device . There was music of various kinds , from the fully-equipped band to the earpiercing fife corps and the bagpipe . In front of Judge Divver 's home there was a sign , " This is where Mr. Divver lives . Tom Foley lives at 242 West One Hundred and Thirty-sixth Street . If the district is good enough to be leader in it ought to be good enough to live in . " THE FOLEY DEVICES . The Foley party had its own devices . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side . One of these showed Judge Divver in a palm garden , with a bottle of wine on the table before which be sat . Underneath were the words : " California  --  here 's where Divver was in 1804 . " The reverse picture showed a cell in Sing Sing , with the three Election Inspectors sentenced in 1894 . The accompanying words were : " You go hunt ? I 'll stick to you . " Yet another picture showed the leader on a run for an express train labeled California , and the text , ? He who quits and runs away will be beat on Primary Day . " The Foley party got under way a few minutes ahead , and passed within hailing distance of the Isabella as she lay at her pier . Then mutual interchanges of wit floated over the water , the noise and distance making them sound like this : " You  --  you ? Divver , hurrah ? to ? with Foley . " On both boats there was free beer for everybody , but there was little disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and found diversion in poker . On board the Isabella a couple of sleeklooking men tried to start a gambling game . " Walk this way , gents , " began one of them , and there was a little scramble . A large man pushed his way through the crowd . " None o ' that , we 'll have none of that . Quick , now , be off with you . " The gambler was about to answer , but his partner pulled at his arm . " It 's Judge Bolte , " he whispered . " Chuck it . " And the other stood not on the order of going . Then the singing fever broke out , and a thousand voices joined in the chorus : Good-by , Foley , you are done for Up against it , I must say . Farewell , Foley . for ' t is over For ' Us Divver , sure , on primary day . And to the same air . " Dolly Grey , " the other faction was singing this : Good-by , Divver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Day . We can see no one but Foley , California  --  Divver a thousand miles away . But the most popular ballad sung by the Foley faction went like this : Now Paddy sees his finish , and an informer he would be . He and Carrie Nation are in the same society ; Around the ward with goggles he became a " Peeping Pat . " For Judge Jerome has said it and his word is good for that . There never was an honest man who stooped to this disgrace , So Democrats beware of him , he has got a double face : And when you meet him on the street turn and pass him by , And listen to the voters . as they shout their battle cry . The Foley party had a beefsteak dinner at Schimmel 's Park , Whitestone , I. When the boat arrived there was a scramble for the dining room , and in the interval before it was opened a thousand or more men pushed and hammered and beat at the I doors . When it was finally opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides by the hungry men , and the waiters were almost mobbed in the fight for food . Up in the balcony a big band was trying to be heard , but the clatter and clash of the knives on the plates as the diners rapped for the waiters drowned out every other sound . Over it all beamed Mr. Foley , - bustling about , here , there , and everywhere , trying ' to see that everybody was served as promptly as he wanted to be , which was , of course , quite impossible . Whenever a waiter with a platter of steak appeared there were a dozen men in line who pounced upon him , emptied his platter , and sent him back for more . CHOWDER FOR DIVVERITES . It was a chowder in fact as well as name , at Witzel 's Point View Park , for which the Divver party headed . They had stewed clams , clams on the half shell , roast clams , and clam chowder . Here . too , the diners lost no time in getting down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Incidentally , it may be added , few " got left . " Both picnics wound up with athletic contests and games of various sorts . Joseph O'Brien of 141 North Sixth Street , Brooklyn , was accidentally shot at the Divver picnic . He was walking about one of the rifle targets when a gun carelessly handled exploded and a charge of shot pierced his leg . A doctor was called and bound the wound . His injury was not serious . Some of the men who attended the Foley picnic were Samuel Ellenburger , Moe Levy , Henry Lowenstein . Mike and Dan Callahan . Tom Reed , the Chinese Deputy She-tiff ; Mike Nicolson , the Greek leader of the Second ; " Smoke , " the " Ivory-Tinted Banner Carrier " ; Lou Cohen , and Domingo Deltice. who says he is a Chinaman , born in Cuba . Martin Engel was also in the . ranks of the F'oleyites . He was asked how Mr. Croker stood in this fight . " He 's not in it , is he ? " was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local fight . anyway ? He knows too much to be mixed Up in these here scraps . It looks pretty good for Foley . though , do n't it ? " Asked as to just what caused the split , Mr. Engel said : " ' Why , there ai n't no animosity . There 's always likely to be this sort of thing . Some men get ambitious and want to push ahead . It 's natural , ai n't it ? Why , if you was living in my district you might take a notion to run against me . I 've held my own for thirty years , but , say , you never can tell about these things . " " I 'm satisfied with the showing , " said Mr. Foley . " The boys have turned out all right , and they 'll stick . " No kick comin ' , " said Judge Divver . " Looks like I 've got plenty of friends , do n't it ? " Foley 's friends pointed significantly to such men as Daniel Volente . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who showed how the tide was running . But to the man who had no opinions and no preferences it looked like a pretty even thing . The numbers were about tied , and as for cheers and noise , it was a toss-up between them . STABBED ON THE MAGENTA Patrick J. Carey of 18 Hamilton Street had a. quarrel of old standing with Lawrence Labasto of 44 Baxter Street . and the two met on the Magenta on the homeward trip of the Foleyites last night . Words led to blows , and Carey pulled out a knife and stabbed Labasto in the back . Dr. Schlansky of 44 Baxter Street dressed the young man 's wound , and he was able to walk home . Carey was locked up in the Oak Street Station . The district was ablaze with light last night and powder was . burned in large quantities in the form of rockets , firecrackers , and roman candles . The Foley party reached the city shortly before 11 o'clock and marched to their headquarters in the Down Town Tammany Club , 1 Chambers Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was plenty of cheering on both sides . There were no encounters between the two factions . The Divver party was detained by the tide at Hell Gate for nearly an hour , and did not get in until after midnight . They went immediately to headquarters , where the parade disbanded . REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FIGHT . Opposition to Mr. Mason in the Twentyninth District  --  Mr. Partridge Enters the Contest . A lively fight is promised at the Republican primaries in the Twenty-ninth Assembly District . Alexander T. Mason , an office holder , and attorney for the American Ice Company , is the present leader . He incurred the displeasure of many Republicans in the district by using his influence to bring about the selection of James Yereance as one of the appraisers under the collateral inheritance tax law . Mr. Yereance until recently had opposed the organization , and attacked Senator Platt , and as he was holding a very lucrative position in an insurance company the voters in the district felt that some person more in need of it should get the place . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Morris of the County Committee and others . and the result was a serious rupture in the Plaza Club , Messrs . Morris , Yereance , and others resigning . Frank H. Partridge , long prominent in the Republican politics in the district . has entered the field for the leadership . He is a retired business man , a member of the Union League , Republican . New York Yacht , and New York Athletic Clubs , and many other social organizations . While it is not certain that Mt . Mason will not again be a candidate , the impression seems to prevail that John W. Jacobus will make the Dace against Mr. Partridge . The latter is confident of success . CONTEST IN THE 25TH . Mr. Hess Aids an Office Holder Inimical to Hawkes . The Republican fight in the Twenty-fifth Assembly District is becoming decidedly warm . Quite recently Edward J. Conway , who was a Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue under Collector Ferdinand Eidmann. was removed on the application of : Hawkes . the leader of the district . The story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be contesting for the leadership of the distract . a position he filled for several years tied tht n relinquished . Conway immediately carried his grievance to Mr. Hess . The latter interested himself in Conway 's behalf . and has secured for him'a position as went in the Immigration Bureau at ** per year . an increase of nearly Mr. Conway has been ordered to Kingston . Oat . Mr. Hess says he is not anxious to be leader .. but wants to rout a clique that is arrogating everything to itself regardless of the rights of the rank and file .
