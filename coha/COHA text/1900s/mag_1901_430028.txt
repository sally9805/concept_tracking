 | WASHINGTON 'S BIRTHDAY has always lent distinction to the month of February . The observance lately of a Lincoln Birthday has given February the first place in every patriots calendar . No university , no public school , no club , allows the 12th or 22d of Febrnary to pass unnoticed . The dailies and the weeklies from Boston to the Golden Gate all have somewhat to say about the men . In many a magazine , character studies receive the place and space the subjects merit . Washingtoniana and Lincolniana are exploited afresh every year , to satisfy the public eagerness for a new story of the two bestloved Americans . But none appear to have thought seriously of making a comparative study of the only two characters in our history whom critics of all schools are wont to pair together . The omission is the stranger in the presence of the obvious circumstance that Washington and Lincoln lend themselves readily to comparison and conspicuously to contrast . Look back at them through the past , and they always seem , as well they may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . How like they were ! Steadfast and serene , patriotic and unpartisan , democratic and not demagogic , national and never sectional , independent and in no respect colonial . American through and through they were . Self-reliance never failed them in the hour of trial . When civilization bade them carry a message to Garcia they never hesitated , ? they carried it . The odds were all against Washington those bleak and bloody days when , with consummate self-certainty , he crushed the Conway cabal . The odds seemed against Lincoln , too , ? most advised and worst advised of all our presidents , because all men thought him at the first a mere provincial in need of counsel , ? when he rejected , in 1861 , without offense , but not without decision , Seward 's audacious offer to become the power behind the throne which he completely filled . They were masters of themselves . Calm and selfpoised , they could possess their souls in patience . When Grant , looking at the Stuart portrait of the first American and quoting John Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by keeping his mouth shut , " perhaps even he did not quite appreciate the price that must be paid for silence . Washington 's temper , as Titanic as his person , was a sensitive point with his wife . Breakfasting one morning with the President and Mrs. Washington , General Lee remarked : " I saw your portrait the other day , but Stuart says you have a tremendous temper . " " Upon my word , " said Mrs. Washington , coloring , " Mr. Stuart takes a great deal upon himself to make such a remark . " " But stay , my dear lady , " said General Lee ; " he added that the President has it under wonderful control . " With something like a smile , the President replied : " He is right . " Men marveled at the perfect self-control of Lincoln in tile darkest days of the Civil War . Only Stanton , Dana , and another friend or two saw him break down now and then . Dr. Rental . Dyer reports that in a moment of confidence Stanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lincoln come in after midnight in an agony of anxiety occasioned by dispatches he had received . He would throw himself at full length on the sofa and cry out : ' Stanton , these things will kill me ! I shall go mad ! I ca n't stand it ! ' At times , both Washington and Lincoln could talk much ; but never , like your Cromwells or Napoleons , of themselves . Silent they habitually were , but not to mislead . They believed the truth was not always to be spoken ; but they also believed that when there was imperative need to speak , nothing but the truth should be spoken . They were ill at the deceptive numbers of a Talleyrand . They had their heartaches and heartbreaks ; but no sorrow ever made them sour , no grief ever made them bitter . They were never less than tender and sympathetic . Washington 's grief at the death of a stepchild is unutterably touching , and Lincoln 's tender words to Speed are exquisite beyond compare : " Speed , die when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew me best that I always plucked a thistle and planted a flower when I thought a flower would grow . " How modest they were ! Nothing so embarrassed Washington as praise . When the Continental Congress was about to choose a general for the Revolution and the discussion was converging toward the only man to be considered  | for such responsibility , John Adams , who was speaking , relates that , , Mr. Washington , who happened to sit near the door , as soon as he heard me allude to him , from his usual modesty , darted into the library room . " The debates with Douglas had already made Lincoln a national character when he earnestly requested an Illinois journal to mention him no more for President : , ' I must in candor say that I do not think myself fit for the Presidency . " Simple as was their religious faith , it was very real . We must give up , of course , the dear tradition that Washington was heard or overheard praying in the Valley Forge thicket , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take away the certainty that he was a religious man , large and liberal and loving . He believed devoutly in God ; and , brought up an Anglican churchman , he was to the last a worshiper in the Episcopal Church , whose stately liturgy never failed to uplift and satisfy . Though Lincoln had no church connection , and possibly no articulate theology , his faith , like Washington 's , was profound . God , eternity , prayer , were words of weight with him and never lightly used . When , just after Gettysburg , the wounded General Sickles asked him why lie had been so sure of victory , Lincoln answered , with all the simplicity of a naive child : ' ' I will tell you if you never tell anybody . Before the battle , I went into my little room and got down on my knees and prayed to God as I had never prayed before . I told Him that this was His country and that this was His war , that we could not stand any more Chancellorsvilles or Fredericksburgs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand by Him ; and He did , and I will . From that hour I had no fear about Gettysburg . " Real and striking as is the likeness between Washington and Lincoln , the contrast , too , is vital and vivid . As types in history , they seem in the large to be unlike . Gazing from a distance at these two tall , strong giants of the ' Western forest , the leafage of the one is first to catch the sight , the rootage of the other is of more significance . Henry Cabot Lodge and Woodrow Wilson to the contrary notwithstanding , the leaves of the one seem to reflect the autumnal tints of Europe . The roots of the other make deep down into new-world soil . For the shaping of the one , nature had to employ her largest old-world mold . For the other " Her old-world molds aside she threw , And , choosing sweet clay from the breast Of the unexhausted West , With stuff untainted shaped a hero new . " The one was of such dignity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe in any heart . The other was so lank and so ungainly as to call out from Mr. Stanton ? no jokemaker ? the appellation , not intended wholly for a sobriquet , The original gorilla . " To imagine Washington as ungainly is about as difficult as to conjure up a graceful Lincoln from the days when two long , lean legs in shrunken bucksin breeches that lacked a few inches in bare ankle of reaching the stockings dangled in mid-air through the ceiling of an Illinois court-room to the election night of 1864 , when the " original gorilla " sat with feet propped high on the White House mantel and shocked the fastidious Stanton by reading and enjoying the broad humor of Petroleum V. Nasby . Of reverence , Washington received all that anv man could wish . Lincoln had a little less ; but to compensate , there was such love as never came even to him who was in his day first in the hearts of his countrymen . Back of the rude but never pointless jokes Lincoln loved even his saddest hour to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for the wounded on a hundred battlefields , and for the countless Rachels mourning for the almost more than countless children laid low on either side of Mason and Dixon 's line . Their affection for him was not reasoned out , nor was it hemmed in by party lines . It was larger than party and greater than reason ; ? it was instinctive . There was no cant at home or in the field when the country called the President Father Abraham ; " for he was a father to the faithful , and unfaithful , too Women hurried with their sorrows to " Father Abraham , " men with their grievances . The mother prayed for a reprieve or pardon for her sleepy boy whose eyes would not stay open in the sentry-box , and the worn and weary solier wanted his furlough . Lincoln denied himself to none ; and while Stanton grumbled and demurred , he refused to few their wish . Thus , before the war had closed , the President 's concerns , his hopes and his aims , his failure and success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he himself became in a real sense a member of each family , bone of their bone , flesh of their flesh . Nature and environment did everything for Washington ; born of pedigree more than respectable , and brought up in the household of a well-bred English nobleman . For Lincoln , come of poor white trash , born as lowly as the Christchild in a hovel , the extreme poverty and sordid destitution of his childhood lighted only by the unfailing smile of a kindly stepmother , nature and environment seemed to do nothing . Washington had the powerful lever of position with which to raise himself to consequence ; Lincoln  | had his boot-straps and the will to try them . In the face of neither , as you see it pictured , is there any sign of happiness ; but while only gravity marks the face of one , the other is unutterably sorrowful . As you look at any of the later Lincoln pictures , you feel sure the cup of sorrow never passed him by till he had drained it even of its bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some have hinted that after that November day in 1842 when lie married Mary Todd he lost the chance of joy . To speak of that would be , perhaps , indelicate . I dare say onlv this , ? that years before , Lincoln laid his heart in the grave with Ann Rutledge ; never had spite of all the charms of Mary Todd , it never had a resurrection day . Gloomy enough by nature , the baptism of that early sorrow deepened the darkness of his later days . Some cornfort he found at last among his children ; but as you look back upon those anxious White House days , you are likely to see in them a Laocoon in agony , yet always submitting in pathetic patience to his tragic destiny . In the mature Washington , who at fourteen wrote wretched doggerel in which dart was made at any cost to rhyme with heart , there is seldom any mark of tender sentiment . Lincoln never outgrew the delicate sentiment of youth . He was not by any means a boy when he tarried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , art-stricken , cried aloud : ' ' I can not bear to have the rain fall upon her . " He was no longer young when he recited sadly to a friend who visited him in Washington the touching lines of Dr. Holmes : The mossy marbles rest On the lips that he has prest In their bloom ; And the name he loved to hear Has been carved for many a year On the tomb . Washington was not entirely lacking in finesse . As early as 1776 , he writes : ' ' I have found it of importance and highly expedient to yield to many points in fact without seeming to have done it . " Occasionally he played the politician . Now and then he did things for effect . On one occasion he offered Patrick Henry a position , knowing in advance that it would be refused . When the well-known revolutionist of France , Volney , asked him for a general letter of introduction to the American people , he dodged the dangerous issue raised by the request and sent back this reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . But one rarely thinks of Washington as tactful . He was too masterful to make much use of tact . Lincoln was at times all tact . Men are still alive whom Lincoln managed for state reasons , while they never knew that they were being managed . Was the cabinet inharmonious ? Lincoln could hold it together . Was the party discordant 7 Lincoln could either allay the discord or extract its sting . Through it all , he never put on a superior air ; never lost his childlike sweetness of temper ; never said a foolish thing or did a rash one ; seldom or never proposed or gave assent to any plan that can not stand the glare of history . Among his intimates , Washington could talk earnestly , impressively , freely , now and then humorously , but he could not talk like Lincoln . " Old Abe " was original , fascinating , irresistible . A soft Kentucky strain was in his voice , And the Ohio 's deeper boom was there , With some wild accents of old Wabash days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation a strange mixture of mirth and melancholy that kept the listener ever oscillating uncertainly between sidesplitting laughter and soul-drenching tears . One who saw Senator Depew with his matchless stories hold the latest Republican national convention in the hollow of his hand at the close of a long session , when delegates were eager to go home , can imagine Lincoln 's power over men ; but Senator Depew , with all his charm of manner , can not take the place of Lincoln . For making the homeliest story point a moral or clinch an argument , we may , possibly , never again look upon the like of Lincoln . Take a random story , more pertinent , perhaps , because it came fresh from the lips of an old-time friend and antedates the Civil Wm by several years . Asked to speak on the tariff question , Lincoln answered , quietly : I confess I have no very decided views on the question . A revenue we must have . In order to keep house , we must have breakfast , dinner , and supper ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring them . But yet there is something obscure about it . It reminds me of a fellow who came into a grocery store at Salem , where 1 once lived , and called for a picayune 's worth of crackers . The clerk laid them out on the counter . After sitting a while , he said to the clerk : I do n't want these crackers : take them , and give me a glass of cider . " The clerk put the crackers back into the box and handed the fellow the cider . After drinking , the fellow started for the door . " Here , Bill , " called out the clerk , " pay me for your cider . " " Why , " said Bill , " I gave you the crackers for it . " " Well , then , pay me for the crackers . " " But I hai n't had any , " responded Bill . " That 's so , " said the clerk . " Well , clear out . It seems to me that I have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out exactly . " So , said Lincoln , it is with the tariff ; somebody gets the picayune , but I do n't exactly understand how .  | In public speaking , Washington was subject to disheartening attacks of stage-fright , which he never overcame . When in 1758 , in the Virginia House of Burgesses , he arose to express his appreciation of a compliment the House had paid him , he was so disconcerted that he could not articulate distinctly . He blushed and faltered and stuck , until the Speaker came to his relief . More than thirty years later , he was called upon to make the most important speech of his whole life . All New York gathered to see him take the oath of office as the first President of the United States . Then if ever he would have risen to the occasion ; but the stage-fright came once more . Senator Maclay noted in his diary that " This great man was agitated and embarrassed more than ever he was by the leveled cannon or pointed musket . " In the Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1787 , Washington spoke only when there was extreme necessity . Of Washington and Franklin , Thomas Jefferson once remarked : ' ' I never heard either of them speak ten minutes at a time , nor to any but the main point which was to decide the question . They laid their shoulders to the great points , knowing that the little ones would follow of themselves . " Though Washington was no orator , Lincoln was . Eloquence was in his blood . He was up betimes in boyhood cultivating his extraordinary genius for public utterance , and while he was still in his teens he won success at corner groceries . Almost from the first , his speeches were models of simplicity and purity . They never lacked concision or precision . The shaft of thought was feathered by consummate art , and sent forth by tremendous moral force . He never took a mean advantage in debate ; he was always fair . He never appealed to the passions of his audience . He always took Reason for his jury , and Conscience for his judge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely feeling in these words of 1858 : ' ' Sometimes , in the excitement of speaking , I seem to see the end of slavery . I feel that the time is soon coming when the sun shall shine , the rain fall , on no man who shall go forth to unrequited toil . How this will come , when this will come , by whom it will come , 1 can not tell ; but that time will surely come . " There was always feeling in his words , for feeling is conviction . There was something else ? uncompromising fearlessness . When all America was winking at slavery and pretending to see no irrepressible conflict near at hand , Lincoln , against the protest of friends who had ambitions for him , spoke these words , which are significant , perhaps unique , in American oratory for their fearlessness as well as their precision . ' ' A house divided against itself can not stand . I believe this government can not endure permanently half slave and half free . I do not expect the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall ? but I do expect it will cease to be divided . It will be all one thing or all the other . " And then there was besides , as Richard Watson Gilder has discovered , a quaint , agreeable cadence , almost rhyme , lurking half concealed in some of Lincoln 's finest phrases . Listen to the second Inaugural : " Fondly do we hope , fervently do we pray , that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away . " Unlike in certain qualities , our two supreme Americans were not unlike in their supreme achievements . There was no structural difference in the work they did ; it was all of a piece . By the scale of a hemisphere they shaped their designs ; but their work was larger than a hemisphere . Look upon it now as it lies spread out before you in the white light of world-wide criticism ; it is of as noble dimensions as civilization itself . It matches the achievements of Alexander and Caesar , Charlemagne and Alfred , Simon de Montfort and Cromwell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in prospect certainly , is greater than Greece or Rome , France or England . Europe herself admits the fact . The Iron Duke , speaking for the Old World , says : " I esteem Washington as perhaps the noblest character of modern times ? possibly of all time . " And an Italian scholar , spokesman for a world old before England was born , offers the stirring panegyric : " Lincoln stood higher in my estimation and love than all the Alexanders and Cmsars who have reddened the pages of history with their brilliant exploits . " The Old World is wont to make room grudgingly in her crowded Valhalla for New-World heroes of a century . Why does she welcome Washington and Lincoln with a cordiality as unusual as it is unexpected ? Thereby hangs a tale , hinted at by many a writer of this generation past . The one object for which men in every age and every clime have toiled and bled and died is peace , ? not of idleness , but of activity ; not the peace of the time-server who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the peace of the strenuous man who asks for a free hand and a long day in which to give all he can for what he gets . As John Fiske hints , as Herbert Spencer tells us plainly , and as John Coleman Adams , writing some years ago in The Century Magazine , illustrates elaborately , civilization takes little time to register anything but man 's struggles and man 's battles for a man 's chance to exercise all his powers of soul and mind and body in peace and safety . Activity against idleness , in order that peace  | may not be shocked by anarchy. ? this has been the powerful purpose of progress from the Stone Age to the Paris Exposition . Come to think of it , this and this alone gives significance to Alexander 's fight near the Arbela . Cesar is charged with hideous barbarity because he slew a million men and sold another million into slavery , but the cruel conquest of Gaul cleared the way for the civilization which at last brings peace . At this moment in the drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps forth on the stage of history to his mission to establish peace in the New World by fighting for it . With the intuition of a world-hero , he apprehended the strange circumstances of the hour ; he dipped into the future , he related the present to the future ? the actual to the possible . In the midst of disunited colonies , a country in anarchy , an inefficient Congress , a disorganized and rebellious army , Washington singled out the central idea , and held it firmly , despite the Babel of discordant policies and treasonable conspiracies that would have swept him from the scene . He heard God say : I am tired of kings , I suffer them no more . For a quarter of a century he moved before his stuggling countrymen , their pillar of cloud by day , of fire by night . This was first and last his forward cry : " Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair ; the event is in the hand of God . " Through all the perils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period which succeeded , he led his murmuring people on to a union , in 1787 , of thirteen independent sovereign States . Angainst the nation 's peace a combination by and by was formed . A mistaken section honestly believed that they could make two nations where Washington had established one , and still maintain the universal peace . In all the years that followed 1787 the South had stood still . She had closed her eyes to the signs of the times . She had failed to discern the national drift . From the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 to the Charleston Convention of 1860 , the South was ever insisting upon what in all sincerity she considered the original interpretation of the Constitution , while the North was growing , stretching westward ? making history , not arguing about it . Introspective , and from much brooding grown , perhaps , a trifle morbid , how could the South read aright the history of civilization ? With eyes blurred by the grievance she thought the North had inflicted , how could she see that to secede was to recede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock of progress ; she had all but stopped it , when the second supreme American came out of the West to say , Hands off ! ? to assure the world that peace could be preserved , and would at any cost . Politicians thought him an accident ; he was , of course , a providence . Wellgroomed and well-fed aristocrats sneered at the loose-jointed unknown from the Illinois prairies . Pharisees loitered in the temple of state , gossiped as of old about the new Messiah , and superciliously inquired , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ? " ? and the question was echoed and re-echoed by the smart set in many a Northern drawing-room . Southern trade held the whip over Congress and the Supreme Court alike . Florida , Alabama , Mississippi , and Louisiana were hurrying after South Carolina to fling themselves over the precipice , and Texas stood shivering on the brink . Many of the departments of government were in the hands of Southern sympathizers . The treasury was empty , public credit low . The arsenals had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed at distant posts ; the navy was small and scattered . Northerners doubted Lincoln 's ability ; Southerners ridiculed his un-Virginian manners . Timid tongues were clamoring for peace at any price . The friends who loved him best were conspicuously uneasy , under the anxiety lest he should prove unequal to the task they had assigned him . Congress embarrassed him . His party deserted him . The cabinet gave him scant respect . Politicians schemed openly for his downfall . Everybody but Lincoln missed the real issue ; and while all America was in a panic , the North crying , " Lo , here , " and the South , " Lo , there , ? he took his place in the Pantheon of world-heroes by singling out of the confusion of the time the central idea , by quickly seizing it and firmly holding it until his grip relaxed in death . " My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union , and is not either to save or destroy slavery , " was his decisive answer to the impatient Greeley . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world at large the peace which Washington had established in the Western Hemisphere . Our two supreme Americans were always a-making , ? the one through a whole generation of public service ; the other , it seemed to many who had followed his career with watchful eyes , by a terrible war , in just four years , from a local politician into the full maturity of the foremost statesman of his age . Devotion to duty and awful responsibility solemnized the face of the one ; the other remained to the last genial and humorous , but the laugh grew less frequent and less boisterous ; the sorrowful eyes looked out more sorrowfully from their cavernous depths ;  | the abstracted air deepened , as care and suffering did their fell work . And yet , as we look upon the Stuart portrait of Washington , painted four years before he counted the last feeble flickerings of his pulse , and upon the life-mask Clark Mills made of Lincoln two months before the fatal bullet sped too surely to its mark , we see brooding over the gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness undaunted self-reliance of the other , that which the one established and the other for America and the world ; and it was hit peace of death , but the peace which pass-tit derstanding.
