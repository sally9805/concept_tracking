txt The newspapers of this city are furnishing accounts of the approaching Tammany celebration in honor of the visit of W. J. BRYAN . it is perfectly evident , to the most careless observer , that it is to cost a great deal of money and is to be a notable political event . Correspondents of newspapers in other parts of the country are sending minute descriptions of the preparations , with many particulars about the lavish expenditure that is to ' be incurred to make Air . BRYAN 'S visit splendid . Maryland is hearing of the coming BRYAN festivities with a Democratic amazement that is appalling in its effect upon the campaign . The Democrats admitted a week ago that the State was . doubtful , and that they were laboring under the disadvantage of lacking the necessary money to conduct legitimate campaign business . A little money , it was asserted a day or two ago , might save the State to the Democratic Party . In Indiana , another doubtful . State , great interest is manifested in the stories of the Bryan reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Fort Wayne , says that Indiana wavers , and that notwithstanding the confidence of the Republicans in the increased farmer support for IVIcKINLEY , the opportunity to use a very little money advantageously in the coal and gas belts would almost assure the Democrats of success . They have used up such money as they had and can get no more from the National Committee , while the Republicans appear to have all they can use everywhere recklessly . Nebraska , BRYAN 'S own State , has been cultivated by the Populists very industriously . But the Democrats and their allies have found the Republicans ablindantly equipped with means just at the time that the meagre Democratic supplies have given out , and no cry is loud enough to command remittances from Chicago or New York . There are other States besides in which the Democrats feel the need of funds to use in overcoming lethargy , apathy , or the conviction that BRYAN is " no good . " AU of them have been begging for as sIstance and getting nothing , and all are reading with protruding eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , a safe Democratic city , at a cost of something like $50,000 for brass bands , kites , red fire , searchlights , roman candles , and skyrockets . To the distressed Popocrats who have no money and who know no way to get it , the burning up and blowing away of $50,000 that might be used to elect BRYAN seems criminal .
