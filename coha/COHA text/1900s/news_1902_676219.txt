txt A lean black bear which weighs 235 pounds is hanging up at the President 's camp on the Little Sunflower , but to the regret of the entire party the first trophy of the hunt did not fall to the President 's rifle . The bear 's trail was struck by the hounds soon after the party started this morning . The members of - the party , except the President , Mr. Foote . Mr. Parker , and Holt Collier . had been stationed at the various crossings , and ? as soon as the dogs gave tongue the President and his guides plunged through the dense underbrush in pursuit . Within a few minutes the dogs showed i'ie direction the quarry was taking , and Holt Collier . with the instinct of an old bear hunter , immediately made up his mind where the animal would come out . To save the President needless hard riding through the brush , he directed Mr : Foote to take the President along the trail to a certain cut-off . This was done , and the President and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several swamp deer were jumped up , but no effort was made to get a shot at them . Then for several hours the President and Mr. Foote waited : The trail of the bear carried the yelping hounds out of hearing , and shortly after noon Mr. Foote abandoned hope that the quarry would come back their way , and he and the President returned to camp for ltnicheon . Had they remained the President would have had a shot , as the bear , with the pack at its heels , crossed at almost the exact spot which Holt had indicated . About a mile beyond this point the bear , exhausted by its long race , ran into a water hole and turned upon the dogs . They were all over him in an instant . The ' poor beast was too exhausted to make ranch of a fight , but it grabbed one of the hounds by the neck and crushed-it through its spine , killing it instantly . As the bear was making a sweep with its pav at another dog Holt Collier jumped from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with a blow on the head . The he blew his horn , indicating that the quarry had been brought to bay . A messenger was sent back for the President . Meantime Holt roped the bear and tied him to a tree . When the President arrived he would neither shoot it nor permit it to be shot " Put it out of its misery , " said he to Mr. Parker , and the latter ended its , life with his knife .

They procured horses and followed a blazed trail until they were stopped by two negro guards with guns . " You have no legal right to stop us , " de-. tiered the correspondents . " This is the only law we know . " replied the negro , tapping his shotgun . The newspaper men started back and then tried the ruse of riding around the guards . but the latter , who had mules , knew the woods better and cut them off almost in sight of camp . This time Freedman Wallace , one of the guards , turned the discomfited correspondents back at the point of his shotgun . The correspondents left with vague threats of legal proceedings against , Wallace , but as the camp and country for miles around is the private property of the Illinois Central , it is not probable that a legal action would stick .
