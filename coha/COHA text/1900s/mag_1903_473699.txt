IN March of 1901 we were in the heart of Ear Mountains , some three hundred miles from the shore of Bering Sea , in northeastern Siberia . This country is wholly uninhabited , and was never before visited by white men . In olden times the mountains served as a barrier between the Chukchee and the Koryak , the two main native tribes of this territory , who carried on continuous warfare against each other . It was the ninth month of my second journey to northeastern Asia , undertaken in behalf of the Jesup North Pacific Expeditious under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural TTistory of New York . From Vladivostok I took the government steamer which once a year carries the post and provisions to Mariinsky Post , the most remote of all Russian settlements on the shores of Bering Sea . Then the real journey began . I left my wife and two Cossacks at Marlin-sky Post to look after the collections , while I started off with the other Cossack to visit the native villages and camps of the surrounding countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin boat along the rocky shores of the Pacific Ocean . Early in the fall we drove with dog-sledges across the flat tundra to the Okhotsk Sea , and . then to the middle Kamchatka , covering about two thousand miles through the deep snow and bitter cold . I could not stay long in the same place , because I had but a twelvemonth for field-work before the arrival of the next steamer , and the territory I wanted lo cover was twice as large as the whole German Empire , and had a population of twenty thousand , scattered in small clusters at distances several days ' journey apart , and with no practicable roads . We carried but few provisions , living chiefly on native food ? dried fish , frozen raw meat , or seal blubber . Half the nights we slept in the open , creeping into sleeping-bags of thick wolfskin and burrowing into the snow . On the very eve of the new year and century we were caught in a severe snowstorm , together with a few native corn-pardons , on the highest point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole party were obliged to sit huddled together on the snow for thirty-six hours , our only shelter a piece of tarpaulin . The moss-pastures of the tundra were covered with a thick crust of hard-frozen snow , and the reindeer were perishing for want of fodder . Farther to the south whole villages were stricken with influenza , and people were dying every day . The last tribe we visited were the Kerek , who live on the seashore between Capes Anannon and Barykoff . They arc exceedingly poor , and are rapidly dying out from long-continued famine . The country is poor even in fuel , for all the driftwood is carried away by the current . For this reason , instead of burning their dead on funeral pyres , as do the neighboring tribes , the Kerek throw them into the sea from high cliffs , ex , horting them by incantations to go away and never to return . On the north side of the mountains which surround the Kerek villages lay the first camps of the Reindeer Chukchee , which stretch far away to the Arctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find some of these camps , and to proceed along their line to Mariinsky Post , but the Kerek refused to act as guides ; and indeed they were no good for that purpose . After some hesitation , T resolved to try the method of the Cossack invaders of former times , who usually followed the rivers up stream , crossed the mountains on the watershed , and then descending along other rivers , reached the opposite shore . Thus , after a few days among the Kerek , our party started northwards , and struggled on its way up the river Hatirkan and its tributaries , through intricate passes actually similar in their sinuosities to ear passages , ? which are hinted at in the name of the mountains . The journey proved to be longer than we had expected . The mountains were hare of vegetation . The passes were filled with snow , and on either side towered precipitous walls of rugged gray stone . For several days we did not see even a raven or a polar owl , which are found almost everywhere on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still as death . At last we climbed to a high plateau and reached the watershed . Our dogs were so fagged out that we could hardly proceed . We had all the time to walk on snow-shoes by the side of the sledges and help the team along . Again and again the dogs would fall down , sinking into a kind of trance , and it took considerable effort to rouse them from their stupor . Usually we would simply lift each dog in turn from the ground and put it on its feet . Then each man would drag his team along by means of a long strap , till the dogs would mechanically recover the use of their legs . On the nineteenth day of our journey we descended into the valley of the Large River , which flows northward towards Anadyr Bay . A few hours afterwards we discovered some old traces of reindeer-sledges , nearly covered by the drifting snow . Our half-dead dogs began to sniff the air , and even tried to run . All of a sudden , at the bend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep bank overhanging the river . Two hours later half a score of bucks were slaughtered in honor of our arrival . The dogs , having eaten their fill of warm meat , lay on the ground , steeping like logs after their painful journey . A large clean hide was spread in the middle of the foremost tent and loaded with frozen meat pounded fine and mixed with tal low , raw kidneys cut in thin slices , bone marrow , and other dainties of the Chukchee bill of fare . We sat on thick skins and feasted , surrounded by the whole population of the camp . Here lay the outposts of the Chukchee , who occupy the whole northeastern corner of Asia . They display a marked differenee from the tribes of the mainland of Asia , and their customs and beliefs bear a strong resemblance both to the American Eskimo and to the Indians of the northwestern shore . The Chukchee are a fierce , warlike tribe . Two centuries ago , in wars with Cossack invaders , they held their ground to the last . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women would kill their children and burn themselves in their tents rather than fall into the hands of the victors . At last. , in the middle of the eighteenth century , large bodies of Chukchee warriors twice succeeded in heavily defeating strong Cossack parties , whose chiefs were killed , or taken captive and afterwards slowly tortured to death . Then the Russian government , tired with useless wars , ordered hostilities to cease ; and since that time the Chukehee reindeer - breeders have lived unmolested in the middle of their desolate barren tundra . Much of their fierceness , however , is still retained at the present time . Murders are frequent , and they are followed by continual acts of blood-revenge , unless the relatives of the first murderer speedily dispose of him themselves , and thus remove the cause of strife . Cases of suicide are hardly less numerous , because even very young people are quite reckless of their own lives , and when thwarted in their purpose will destroy themselves from anger or spite , jealousy or unassuaged desire . Persons suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened with age , often proclaim their wish to be killed by their nearest relatives . Then the sons or the nephews , who otherwise are kind and dutiful to their elders , feel themselves bound to comply , however unwillingly , with the request . No retraction is permissible , since such an announcement is considered as a promise of human sacrifice to the evil spirits . If taken back , the revenge of the spirits on the whole family will be incurred . I know of a case where a man , after a violent quarrel with his five sons , announced aloud his wish to die . The next morning he thought . better of it and retracted his words ; but ? so I was informed in all seriousness ? the revengeful spirits shortly afterwards inflicted the hoof-disease on his herd , and took away three of his sons , one after another . Usually , however , the man who has proclaimed his wish to die remains firm until the end . I met , in 1895 , at the Anui fair in the Kolyrna country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he wanted to get rid of the troubles of this world . He had no apparent illness , but his zest for life had completely vanished , and he intended to start for the land of his forefathers . He was as eager for death as if it meant for him a pleasant journey to a distant but very interesting country . The vicinity of the Russian fort was no place for the fulfilment of his wish , so he had to delay it for a couple of months ; but when next I met Katik 's wife , early in the fall , she was already a widow . She told me the details of her husband 's death in a very simple way . He was strangled with a lasso . She held his head in her lap , and two of his sons pulled the ends of the rope . Katik 's wife told me also that he was cheerful to the last , and even joked the very moment his face was being covered with the hood of the death coat to prevent those present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a long knife is used at a " voluntary death . " The man wishing to die bares his breast , and himself points the knife to the right place against . his heart . The executioner has only to push the knife forward . In some families a violent death by voluntary request descends by heredity from generation to generation , and a natural end is considered a disgrace to the memory of the deceased . One of the attendants I had with me for two years while in the Kolyma country belonged to a family with a tradition of this kind . He was a man of fifty , and his father and elder brother had already followed in the way of their ancestors . One time , when stricken with a violent fever , instead of taking the medicine that I gave him , he inquired anxiously if I were sure that he would recover at all . Otherwise he felt bound to send for his son and ask for the last stroke . Ideas of death , however , were very far from the camp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year in that country , and the people used every pretext to arrange for feasting and sports . News of our coming had spread through the neighboring camps like wildfire , and the next morning about a hundred men and women were upon us , eager to gaze on the strange faces , perhaps to taste of the white men 's provisions , and to take every advantage of the occasion to have a good time and make merry . The middle-aged people had a reindeer-race for a distance of five miles , which lasted an incredibly short time . The younger men and the girls formed in two large groups , and each had a foot-race over the deep snow , which had been scraped and loosened by the sharp hoofs of the racing reindeer . Wrestlers bared themselves to the waist , and rubbed their bodies with damp snow until they glowed all over and were reeking with perspiration . Then they grappled hi twos , pair after pair , and tumbled on snow quite unconcernedly , till one of the parties was forced to yield and stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestlers than men . They began the match in their underclothes ; but very soon everything was torn to shreds and they were pounding each other on the ground , scratching and biting like cats , so that the crowd had to separate them . Meanwhile I tried to induce some old men to relate stories , many of which are similar , even in details , to the Indian tales of the opposite shore . ' " You came from unknown countries , " argued the oldest of them , Kuwat , who had lame feet , and was carried around on the shoulders of one of his grandnephews , " so you must know many curious things . Exchange is fair , and guests should be the beginners . " I told them about the mammoth 's younger cousin ( elephant ) , who still walks on the earth , and is even tamed by men and put into harness . They did not object to the mammoth 's cousin , but insisted that those who tamed him must be spirits , and not mortals . When I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally relish a bit of human flesh , it fully corroborated their first opinion . Then I tried to give them an idea of the wonders of civilization . I told them that our tents are made of iron , and that we put ten houses one on top of another , so that the whole looks as high as the neighboring hill , and gives shelter to as many people as all the camps between the Arctic and the Pacific shore . They listened with astonishment and wanted to know more . But when I explained that our land is all cut up into square lots and sold at high prices , and that a man can lose his way not only in the open country , but also among the houses , in the midst of large crowds hurrying in all directions , their mistrust broke out openly , and my part as a story-teller was - finished then and there . After supper a seance of magic began , which accompanies every big feast of this tribe . The low , square sleeping-room was crammed full with people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and their bodies , shining with sweat , jostled against each other on the slightest motion . The shaman , who also was nearly naked , sat in the right-hand corner left free for the performance . The light was put out , and the shaman began to chant , beating his drum with such force that in a few minutes we were half stunned by the deafening din , and utterly lost the location both of the drum and of the singing voice . Then began the ventriloquistic part . The spirits would call from a height above in a distant voice , which would gradually come nearer ; another voice would answer from the opposite side ; then a dialogue would ensue , ending in violent abuse ; and in-visible adversaries would rush into the room , warsuing each other , diving underground , and flying back into the height above . It was a volley of mad cries , though of course no two were ever uttered at the same time . All the while the shaman beat his drum without interruption , to show that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time came the tricks , which were surprisingly similar to those performed by spiritualistic mediums . An invisible hand suddenly drew out the large skin lying in the middle of the room , loaded with remnants of supper , and all the knives and plates flew about in the dark . The skin walls of the sleeping-room were suddenly lifted over our heads , and the white rays of the moon slipped in for a moment . Somebody spilled icy water all around the room . Somebody scratched against the skins from without , as if asking for entrance . The listeners were frightened , and tried to lie flat , as far as the space would allow . A lasso was deftly thrown across the narrow space , and the running noose fell over my shoulders . I tried to catch it ; but it wriggled through Lay fingers like a live snake , and vanished just as swiftly . Suddenly the shaman stopped drumming , and the last ringing note of his song wailed brokenly and then was silent . The mistress struck a match and lighted the lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaman 's head . He was in a trance , and to look at his face might bring misfortune . His soul was wandering beyond the limits of the universe , but the body had to sleep it out for a couple of hours . After that he would awaken , and tell the people of the sights he had seen during his magic flight . And as he slept all the rest of us leaned back and closed our eyes .
