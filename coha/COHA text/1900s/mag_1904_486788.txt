It was- not necessary for Secretary Hay to come to New York to prove that his pen had not lost its cunning . One speech more could add little to his reputation as a man whose words , in Lady Gregory 's phrase , " crystallize into epigrams as they touch the air . " And it was not a literary treat that we had a right to ask of him  --  grateful as is the delicate play of his wit amid the rude bawling of the run of stump speakers  --  but a full and frank deliverance on matters of which he is especially competent to speak , and as to which his course ( which is that of the President ) has been sharply challenged . But we ask for facts and we get  --  phrases . Now phrase-making has its perils . A clever verbal turn may excite immediate laughter , but if it sticks in the mind long enough to lead to reflection , the ' result may be laughter on the wrong side of the mouth . Thus , Mr. Hay on Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense that a disinfectant is unsafe for a microbe . Excellent ! Nothing could be happier , unless it suggested to the hearer to run over some of the microbes in the political world to which the Roosevelt formaldehyde has been applied with lethal effect . There was that deadly bacillus , lattayicus Pennsylvanzensis ; but we remember that it simply waxed fatter the more of the Roosevelt disinfectant was poured upon it . Every one knows , too , bow the said disinfectant acted rather as a restorative upon that venerable microbe , " Lou " Payn . And as for the most fatal of all the microscopic political wrigglers , Addicks , he is this day hailing Theodore Roosevelt as a friend and ally who is aiding the great Delaware corruptionist with what Addicks calls the " courage of his new convictions . " Powerful disinfectant , this The microbes themselves grin at it . It was a natural supposition that Mr Hay , speaking in Carnegie Hall , would pay , some attention to the damaging revelations made by Senator Culberson in the same place a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the legality , of the Administration 's course in Panama was roundly called in question . Had the head of the State Department no reoly to make ? It was John Hay the Secretary of State , not John Hay the literary artist , from whom we were entitled to demand a plain tale about all those devious proceedings . But we did not get it . He did not pass it by in entire silence . In that , his art failed him . It would have been better to ignore charges than to make a weak and inconclusive reply to them . And Mr. Hay 's remarks upon the Panama business were far from going to the core . He denies that President Roosevelt committed an act of war against Colombia , but his sole reason is that the peace was not broken , " Not 4 tostile shot was fired " But this , obviously , is to make the weakness of a victim the true measure of his assailant 's virtue . Mr. Hay 's definition of highway robbery would-apparently be that the crime exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turpin . Equally short of meeting the case is the Secretary 's account of what was actually done . He refers simply to " the notice given hostile forces on the Isthmus that they were not to fight on the line of the railroad , which it was our duty to keep open . " As if that were the whole of it ! Mr. Hay conceals the fact that the orders were to prevent Colombian troops from landing within fifty miles of the railroad ; that Admiral Coghlan notified Gen. Reyes that his orders were to forbid the Colombians to land a force " anywhere within the territory of Panama . " If this is not an act of war , what would be ? If there was any warrant in law or treaty for such astounding orders , why has net somebody produced it ? It seems impossible that the John Hay who made this evasion is the very same John Hay who wrote of another Government , in ' Castilian Days , ' " There is a lack of principle in the higher walks of Government . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of conscience in political matters . . . . They have a brow of bronze when detected and exposed in a misrepresentation . " It would have been almost better for the Secretary to drop into his cynical mood , and to explain his course in going with the President to do evil in the words of his own poem , " Una " : ? unhorsed I lay At the feet of the strong god , Circumstance . " To none of the new evidence going to show that the Administration had a guilty knowledge of the impending revolution in Panama , did Mr Hay , though speaking on the defensive , deign to refer . Sefior Duque , one of the Panama conspirators , has stated that he " knew " the revolution was to have the support of this Government . He says also that he called at the State Department more than a month before the revolution was brought off . Bunau-Varilla gave his word to the schemers in Panama that United States warships would appear in time to aid them  --  as they did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1903 , of a " proposition " made to him to " foment the secession of Panama , " adding that , though he could not do that publicly , " privately , I freely say to you that I should be delighted if Panama made itself an independent State at this moment . " Do not all these suspicious circumstances cry aloud for explanation ? Could not Secretary Hay fairly be called upon to say something about them ? Imagine the - way in which he would have exercised his nimble wit and biting sarcasm at the expense of a Democrat caught in such a moral coil ! Panama has ruined many a reputation in France , and it promises to stand in history as the one great blot upon Mr. Hay 's diplomacy . He early mishandled the situation , rejecting the proposal that alternative treaties be made with both Nicaragua and Colombia , before the final decision as to route was reached . That measure of common prudence would have averted all these subsequent troubles . But Mr. Hay clung bhndly to the Nicaraguan canal , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came when , as Mr. Roosevelt wrote , the most competent engineers told the Administration that " we had better have no canal at all " than go to Nicaragua . Then it was too late for the diplomatic negotiations which Mr. Hay should have attended to years before ; and the original blunder led on to one unhappy consequence after another . until the final wrong was done of attempting to make fraud and force do the work of patient reason . To defend all this is possible only in the spirit of what Mr. Hay , in the days when his ardor against oppression moved him to write the " Curse of Hungary , " called the " weak worship " of the sword . THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNORS . The theory that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed , ridiculous though it may appear to our enlightened age , was once held by a considerable number of Amer- - icans . Doubtless there yet survive among the lower classes a few victims of this ancient and formerly popular superstition . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week offered to an audience in the backwoods of Brooklyn a new interpretation of the phrase " consent of the governed . " Referring to a document ' issued July 4 , 1776 , sometimes known as " the Declaration of Independence , " Mr. Taft asserted : " That Declaration , when it speaks of the consent of the governed , has reference to people having knowledge as to what are their own best interests . " Following the clue given us by Secretary Taft , we have examined with curious interest the musty document which for some inscrutable reason he thinks worthy of citation . To understand it fully without a knowledge . of the circumstances under which it was drafted , is impossible ; but on one or two points the signers of the so-called Declaration are reasonably explicit . They labored under the delusion that an unnamed " King of Great Britain , " to whom they /refer with amazing irreverence , was trying to reduce " these colonies " ? thirteen are specified  --  to a condition of vassalage . From the tone of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Secretary Taft , was the real possessor of superior knowledge , the silly colonists , just like the wretched Filipinos of to-day , thought they knew what was best for themselves . Between the colonists and the King there was a striking difference of opinion , as shown in the following sentences from the Declaration : " He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good . " He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained . " To a man of modern views the irritating thing about this Declaration is the impudent assumption of these colonists , thionsands of miles away froim the centre oaf light and authority , that they actually had knowledge as to what Were their own best interests . In the very nature of the case such knowledge was impossible . They were scattered in small hamlets through a vast wilderness ; they had scant Tne.ars of communication ; their Schools were few and feeble . The King-had by their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gov . Wright in the Philippines , sent home word that everything was going well . And yet the Declaration of the colonists conveys a distinct impression of dissatisfaction . We shall be interested at some future time to follow the fortunes of these ignorant and ungrateful people , and to learn Whether they ultimately received from a long-suffering King the punishment they ' so richly deserved . In the meantitne , we are glad to apply to one or two recent events the principle which Secretary Taft has enunciated so lucidly and vigorously . For example , some time ago a law authorized the payment of United States District Attorneys throughout the country by fixed salaries instead of fees . There were , however , such fat pickings in New York that an exception was Made of this district ; and Henry L. Burnett , the incumbent , receives , in addition to his regular salary , fees that in some years have amounted  --  so well-informed men are convinced  --  to at least $50,000 . Here is indubitably an instance of extravagance and abuse . In order to ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested its Washington correspondent to ascertain how much the United States District Attorney for Southern New York ihas been receiving in addition to his proper salary . The very Assistant Secretary Taylor who has solemnly denied that there were " Administration orders ( forbidding the publication of information regarding Governmental expenditures , " flatly refused this particular information . Attorney-General Moody niVaS equally unrwtilhng to make any disclosure . It is the money of the citizens that is being spent , but we plain people are too dull to know whether the expenditure is discreet or fooliall ; ' we must leave such questions to iwiser heads , say , men like Beavers , Machen , and Heath , miracles of wisdom and probity . Not always , however , are our gracious officials so unrelenting towards the erring . Some young Filipinas who are being educated in this country have , with the rashness of youth , expressed from the stump a desire for Philippine Independence . What have the authorities at Washington done ? Thrown the malcontents into prison , or returned them to the straw huts from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities have exhatited extraordinary magnanimity : " It seems reasonably clear that the Administration could take these youths to task for participating in the Bryan campaign , but it is unlikely that this will be done during the present campaign . " There 's the limit of forbearance . it has been said in extenuation that the boys would at once make martyrs of them , would advertise their sentiments more widely , and would neutralize the argument that Filipinos greatly prefer our rule . For our own part we impute higher motives than more political expediency . Assistant Treasurer Taylor and Attorney-General Moody are probably unaware that an election is pending , but they know that the figures about extra payments to Mr. Burnett are not milk for babes like the general public , but meat for strong men like themselves . Moreover , they view the faults of the Filipino boys with detached impartiality . For this sublime tolerance , and for all other mercies let us be duly thankful , realizing that the essential thing is not the consent of the governed , but of the governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " demanded Mr. Chamberlain indignantly the other day , when defending his proposal to levy protective duties , " if what I take in one hand I give hack with the other ? " That is protection in a nutshell . In other parts of his latest speech Mr. Chamberlain showed how well he had learned to parrot American protectionists . He reproduced with zest their contention that it is the- foreigner who pays the tax ; and , with an enthusiasm like their own , contradicted himself on the question of the effect of the tariff upon prices . English manufacturers simply could not compete with low-priced foreign goods ; duties must be clapped on to protegt them ; yet the moment that was done , the goods would be sold to the dear English consumers at still lower prices . This is as amusing as it is tonsillar ; but in no other particular did Mr. Chamberlain show- more plainly that he had grasped the true theory of protection than in his account of it as a system of forcibly taking money from the people on the promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the vicious assumption that fettered industry and commerce are better than free ; that meddling legislators can improve on natural law . Governmentally and sca daily , it is paternalism in its worst form . The individual merchant or manufacturer does not know what is good for him , and would ruin his own bud- , ness if left to go his own mad course . Hence a supernally wise Government steps in to " take " his money away from him by tariff taxation , comfortably assuring him the while that he will get it all back again . The bargaining nature of protection is of its very essence . ' When at its best , it involves the sort of striking of hands between the citizen and the Government which Mr. Chamberlain so innocently described . " Give me , " says a protectionist Government , " all the money I ask in taxation , and trust me to take care of your profits . " But in this country the Republican party has pushed the taking and giving of protection far beyond these idyllic beginnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of actual fact , protection is a system of organized political corruption . Party managers go to the beneficiaries of the tariff and say with a meaning as yet undreamed of by Mr. Cha , mberlam , " What ' does it matter if we take money from you for the political campaign , provided we more than - gave it tack to you in the shape of a guarantee that your law-'swollen profits , your purchased ' privilege of taxing your fellow-citizens , shall be undisturbed ? " This is the malign form of the protective do lit des in the United States . It is a sale outright of the law-making power . All the " frying of fat " out of protected mianufactuters that has been done since Senator Plumb was frank enough to describe the process accurately , has gone upon the understanding that large subscriptions to a party fund Carry with them the right to dictate the laws affecting the business of the subscribers . Does any intelligent man doubt that Mho 's form of corruption is extensively employed to-day in order to promote the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! behalf from Washington represents him as highly resentful of Judge Parker 's charge that the Repurblican Committee is ; collecting large sums from Trusts and corporations dependent upon tariff favors . The President thinks that the character of the men conducting his campaign ought to be a sufficient answer to all such allegations . But a corrupt system can not be made pure even in the cleanest hands . The angel Gabriel could not fry the fat without soiling his wings . And it is really not a question of character , but of fact . Is it or is it not true that Chairman Cartelyou or one of his agents has gone to protected manufacturers , to large etasporate interests , ' railroads , and Trusts , to ask for money to elect Mr. Roosevelt ? If it is not true , it ought to be the easiest thing in the world to prove the charge a slander . Let the books be opened . Let Mr. Cortelyou deny categorically the statement that he has sought such contributions . Let him specify by name the manufacturing and other corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demand . In that way he could speedily cover his accusers with confusion . But if the charge is true , what does it necessarily ' imply ? Judge Parker was absolutely correct when he said that no corporation , as such , could make a campaign contribution except for dishonest purposes . It would be , in the nature of the case , a giving by the tens of thousands in the hope of getting again by ' the hundred thousand . It is , in effect , making merchandise of law ; and is the last step in the perversion of justice as pictured by the great historian  --  first by force , then by traud , finally by money . This is the great shame and threat of protection as we know it . That the systeen is short-sighted , oppressive , outgrown economically and industrially , it is. easy to show ; but the feature of protection which to-day makes honest men eager to see it burnt up as a public iniquity , is its insolent entrenching itself in public corruption , its unblushing purchase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effrontery with which , having , despoiled , it enters upon possession of the Government as if it were but one more of its chattels . If protection is ever to be destroyed , it must be by men who clearly see and loathe its immorality , its monstrous social injustice , and Whose hearts burn within them as they confront privilege buying its way to power and asking brutally , " What are you going to do about it ? "
