 | IT is to be hoped that one of the results of the tercentenary celebration of the discovery of Lake Champlain will be the discovery of the man whose name it bears . Readers and writers of English have paid comparatively little attention until recently to the career and works of a man who was in many respects the most remarkable of all the pioneers in the exploitation of the New World . Americans can not excuse themselves on the ground that they have no interest in Canadian history ; for Champlain was not only the founder of New France , he was also the first explorer in the true meaning of the word of the New England coast , and quite the first to publish a full and accurate report of his observations . He was , moreover , the first European to give an exact account of the life of the Indians of New England and New York . His writings contain passages of especial fascination to New Yorkers and Vermonters , being the narration of the first white man who viewed and described the shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and the adjacent mountains . Yet for 270 years his writings remained a sealed book for English readers , and not until still more recent years have his works been available in any general way to the American public . One can not read many pages of the voyages without feeling himself irresitibly drawn toward this central figure who first opened the northern door of the beautiful Champlain Valley to white visitancv , that individual in whose career one mere incident has at length become a fact large enough to merit a great commemorative celebration . Yet this fact is not his chief claim to distinction . His fields of activity were so numerous , so rich in varied incident , wide travel , and perilous adventure , his permanent contributions to the knowledge of aboriginal conditions were so many and so positive that he placed succeeding generations repeatedly under obligations to him . A brief survey of some of these activities and contributions will better enable one to appreciate the man who first broke into this corner of American wilderness with the arts of a civilized race . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspirer and the dominating spirit in French exploration and colonization in America . He was especially well prepared for his work . Temperament , education , and early associations contributed to this end . Samuel Champlain was born in 1567 , in Brouage , a little seaport on the Bay of Biscay . His father was a captain in the royal navy , and this with other circumstances in the boy 's early life gave him an acquaintance with military and commercial enterprises . He fought for the King in Brittany . He was for a few years quartermaster in the army and gained business experience in its departments . He mastered the elements of navigation . He gave attention to cartography . He visited the West Indies and for over two years studied at first hand the operation of Spanish methods of colonization . He made sketches and plans of the principal ports of the islands , thus early cultivating that habit of using his pencil to which we owe so much . He landed at Vera Cruz , went inland to the City of Mexico , on his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three centuries ago , his fertile brain conceived the idea of a ship canal across the Isthmus , " by which , " he says , " the voyage to the South Sea would be shortened by more than 1,500 leagues . " His voyages to the Atlantic Coast be-  | gan the area work of his career in 1603 . Champlain was then thirty-five or thirty-six years old . An old acquaintance , Aymer de Chastes , Governor of Dieppe , under whom Champlain had served in the royal fleet off Brittany , came to court to seek a patent of Henry IV , " resolved , " as Champlain says , " to proceed to New France in person and dedicate the rest of his days to the service of God and his king . " The gray-haired veteran found in Champlain a man after his own heart , and the latter was nothing loth to leave the antechambers of the Louvre for the uncharted shores of the New World . He accompanied the expedition in the capacity of geographer to the king . To the incident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making full notes and sketches do we owe the cultivation of his habit of preparing full reports of his experiences with the utmost care . His official appointment imprest upon him the responsibility for ac curacy and fulness , while it created a demand for the products of his pen . In this voyage Champlain explored the Saguenay River some thirty or forty miles . He noted the extraordinary features of the stream and its shores , and altho not the first white man to view them he was the first to give an account of them . He went up the St. Lawrence River also as far as the Lachine Rapids in boats and a few miles further on foot along the shore . His characteristic thoroness is shown in this expedition . Sixty years before him Cartier had traversed the same course . His brief and fragmentary narration had no marked influence in stimulating interest in exploring New France . Champlain explored both shores of the river , the bays , inlets , and tributary streams , described the character of the soil , the forests , the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who exhibited  | marked differences from those found by Cartier . The results of his exploration Champlain published in an elaborate report under the King 's sanction , and this report became an authoritative and important work in the early stages of French colonization in America . Champlain 's next voyage brought him to the coast of Nova Scotia , whither he accompanied a colonizing expedition headed by De Monts and Poutrincourt . It happened that Champlain was the best engineer in the party and to him fell the lot of choosing the site and laying out plans of the grounds and buildings . His main purpose , however , was exploration , and from the settlement as a base he began to extend his knowledge of the region at the first opportunity . Thus began the first detailed observation of the New England Coast made by Europeans . Champlain spent three summers in this work , and his winters in charting the region and making many local maps of bays , harbors and rivers . The first of these surveys he began in September , 1604 .. He examined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their names to Mt . Desert Island and Isle Haute , and penetrated the Penobscot as far as the site of the city of Bangor . In a subsequent voyage he explored the mouths of the Kennebec and Saco observing carefully the natives and their customs and noting comparisons with the habits of the Indians found further north . He saw one of their fortifications , a palisade fort , and stopped and made sketches of it . He spent two clays at Old Orchard Beach . He conferred with the Indians at Cape Ann , gave them a piece of charcoal and got them to draw a rough outline of Massachusetts Bay . They showed him the location of several different tribes by arrangements of pebbles . He sailed into Boston Harbor , * followed the shore , and a few days later entered Plymouth Harbor , a decade and a half ahead of the Mayflower . Of Plymouth Harbor Champlain made a fairly accurate drawing . He described the Indians and their occupations and implements . He then rounded Cape Cod and proceeded as far as Nauset Harbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his little settlement . It was Champlain 's intention to complete this exploration of the New England Coast the following summer . This plan was interfered with by Poutrincourt , who wished to see for himself the points covered in the previous year 's exploration . Thus delayed , Champlain proceeded as far as Chatham Harbor , where it became necessary to put in and repair his disabled barque . This done , he sailed along Vineyard Sound , which marks the southern terminus of his New England explorations . Thus he completed three years and four months of pioneer work of the most thoro kind on the Atlantic Coast at a time when there was not an European settlement of any kind on the eastern shore of North America between his own little colony and Florida . Nor had there been any previous exploration of any significance . Gosnold and Pring had touched the coast , but left brief and indefinite notes . Weymouth anchored at Monhegan Island during Champlain 's second summer . John Smith gave the English their fullest early description of  | the New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the romantic Englishman 's by a decade , while in point of historical value it was far more important . It covered an ample and fairly accurate survey of the sinuous New England Coast line for a thousand miles ; it gave minute and careful descriptions of the soil , forests and people . n respect to the latter , it portrayed their appearance , dress , habits of life , occupations , domestic relations , and civil institutions . This is the earliest accurate account of the New England Indians before their contact with white men , and it is the nearest approach to a critical study of them left by any early voyager . The monopoly of the fur trade , under which De Mont 's little colony was to be established , was rescinded in 1607 , and Champlain sailed for France , after a brief exploration of the Basin of Mines . His activities hereafter were to lie in the Valley of the St. Lawrence , in which his initial exploration had been made five years before . A quarter of a century of hard work awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped at the active center of the Canadian fur trade , Tadoussac , but Champlain left him there and on June 30 , 16o8 , held his course up the river till he reached the rugged cliffs where three days later he laid the foundations of Quebec . Champlain 's pencil has given us a rude picture of the little group of wooden buildings which his workmen erected . Here with twentyeight men he elected to spend the winter while Pont Grave returned to France . Twenty of his twenty-eight men were dead before spring , and half the rest were suffering from disease . It had been a winter of tragic misery . But no sooner had the returning sails gladdened the eyes of the little band of watchers on the cliffs than Champlain resumed his plans for exploration . An ordinary man would have had enough of it . But Champlain 's mind was not at rest , and within a fortnight of Pont Grave 's return he had set out an expedition into the country of the Iroquois . The incidents of this expedition are to be commemorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to enlarge his personal knowledge of the country , and to gain political advantage thru alliance with the Algonquins of the Ottawa and the Hurons of the lake beyond . The fur trade was the great asset of the wilderness . Upon it depended the success of the settlement at Quebec and the fate of New France . the fur trade , in turn , depended upon the co-operation of the Indians of the regions named . Thru their wildernesses came the fur-laden canoes ; thither lay the ever-luring path to China . These tribes could not be depended upon to help the French unless the French could be depended upon to help the Indians . This was the give and take of Indian politics . Champlain was the soul of honor even in dealing with savages . Their relations meant nothing less than an offensive and defensive alliance . This alliance became a principle of French policy . Following this principle Champlain deliberately incurred the enmity of the most powerful native tribes in America , the tribes of the Iroquois , because they were the enemy of his allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his allies , the encampments , the deliberations , the methods of travel and difficulties en route , and the incantations of the Pilotois or soothsayers are all described in Champlain 's account of the expedition . When the lake was reached and progress became more dangerous the plan of advance was altered and the company moved only by night and rather slowly up the lake along the western shore . It was anticipated that the war party , for it was nothing less , would pass thru Lake George and on the Hudson River , from which it might strike a swift blow on some outlying Mohawk town . Champlain 's narrative is as follows : " Continuing our course in this lake on the west side I saw , as I was observing the country , some very high mountains on the east side , with snow on the top of them . I inquired of the savages if these places were inhabited . They told me that they were ? by the Iroquois and that in these places there were beautiful valleys and open stretches fertile in grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great many other fruits ; and that the lake went near some mountains , which were perhaps , as it seemed to me , about fifteen leagues from us . I saw on the south others not less high than the first , but they had no snow at all . The savages told me that it was there that we were to go to find their enemies , and that these mountains were thickly peopled . They also said it was necessary to pass a rapid , which I saw afterward , and from there to enter another lake , three or four leagues long ; and that when we had reached the end of that it would be necessary to follow a trail for four leagues , and to pass over to a river which empties on the coast of the Almouchiquois . " The enemy , however , saved them the trouble of making so long a journey . About ten o'clock on the night of the 29th of July , near Ticonderoga , an Iroquois flotilla was sighted , and instantly the silence of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Iroquois made for the shore , landed , and threw together a barricade , for which they felled trees . Champlain mentions their use of stone axes . I3 e and his party remained on the lake , within arrow range of the shore , lashing the canoes together with poles to prevent their separation in case of attack . By mutual assent the battle was deferred till daybreak , when the canoes were allowed to land and the allies drew up on the shore . The three Frenchmen in the party had managed to remain concealed in the canoes , and now Champlain 's two companions made their way into the woods unnoticed by the enemy . As the Iroquois came forward from their barricade in good order and formed in line " strong and robust to look at , " headed by three chiefs , and numbering in all about two hundred of the fiercest fighters on the continent , the ranks of the allies opened and there stepped toward the front , amid howling redskins , a single figure calculated to strike the Iroquois with amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hose , armed with a breastplate and thigh pieces of steel , a plumed casque on his head , his sword hanging by his side , and an arquebuse in his hand . Thus , in the days of Shakespeare , when Milton was a yearold babe , eleven years before the landing of the Pilgrims , on the shore of a lake in the heart of the American wilderness ( lid these splendid types of savagery and civilization confront each other . Mark Twain has given a very entertaining picture of the juxtaposition , of two stages of society thirteen centuries removed ; but the Connecticut Yankee in  | King Arthur 's Court , bagging with his revolver the finest specimens of chivalry as they came charging down the list , enjoyed no more dramatic moment than did the gentleman of France when he raised his arquebuse at Ticonderoga and sent two hundred of the boldest warriors in aboriginal America running to the woods . Champlain wrote as follows : " After we had gained the victory , they amused themselves by taking a great quantity of Indian corn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had left in orderto run better . . This place , where this charge was made , is in latitude 43 degrees and some minutes , and I named the lake Lake Champlain . " The victors made a hasty return down the lake , while the vanquished who escaped sought their familiar paths to spread among the five nations the news of this strange encounter and to sow the seeds of implacable hatred of the stranger and his kin . This expedition , while not comparable to Champlain 's leisurely and critical examination of the New England Coast , gave him an opportunity to make a hasty survey of the lake for nearly its entire length and furnished the French a valid claim to the region . This claim was the basis of French seignioral rights which stretched from Chambly to Crown Point , along the eastern side of the lake , one of which , at least , passed from French to English hands with " rights of high , middle , and low justice " as bravely as any feudal manor , on payment of 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arquebuse , however , nullified his discovery , for the enmity of the Iroquois was sufficient to prevent the easy establishment of those claims . The English pushed northward into the valley , threw out scouting parties right and left , and met the French chain of forts begun by de Tracy in the Richelieu Valley . Thus the ancient feud was passed on from the savage to the civilized races , the French and the English taking up the struggle of their prototypes , Algonquins and Iroquois . A few more of Champlain 's efforts deserve passing notice . In 1615 he brought to New France four Recollet friars whose mission work laid the foundations of the unparalleled record made by the Jesuits in North America . His zeal as an explorer carried him far tip the Ottawa , westward to Lake Nipissing , thence to Lake Huron , to Lake Ontario , and to Central New York , where he once more attacked his old-time enemies , the Iroquois . He joined the fall hunting party of the Indians in 1615 and has given the earliest and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . In 1632 he prepared a final edition of his works ; in 1633 he returned from France to Canada with a commission as governor ; and tiro years later , on Christmas Day , he died in a little chamber of the fort at Quebec , stricken with paralysis . Champlain 's career challenges comparison with that of every other man of whatever nationality engaged like him in constructive pioneering . Ile was a patriot without being a pirate , a builder but not a buccaneer . Neither was he an exile , a refugee , nor a recluse . He was a full-blooded man , a man of grand dreams , but also a man of unrivaled execution , a man of vast conceptions , but also of unsurpassed versatility , undaunted courage , unwearied patience , and withal a man of tact , integrity , sweet temper , and Christian character . He undertook a great work for France , but his success consists of what he did for America . He established a standard in American cartography . Ile showed that the seventeenth century could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He was the most scientific explorer of America in his day . As a colonizer he met in Canada the problems which John Smith faced in Virginia , but he confronted these problems for years instead of months . As an historian he surpasses Smith in accuracy and fulness of important detail , Bradford in comprehensiveness of vision , and Winthrop in the breadth of his tolerance and the wide range of his interests . None in the history of New France outranked him as a leader of men . None surpassed him save in single qualities . As soldier , sailor , engineer , colonizer , leader , geographer , cartographer , ethnographer , historian , religionist and patriot he stands alone in his times in unrivaled versatility .
