Sax : " W. C. L ' s " letter in the last issue of the Nation , - raising the question , How can any sane man vote for Parker ? and conversely , How can any sane man vote for Roosevelt ? gives , I take it , the views of but one class of men on each side of the question . Brokers and college professors are doubtless an important part of the body politic , and , under an ideal form of government , should wield more influence than they now do in shaping public policy as determined by elections ; but under our present system of counting noses at election time , it is the man in the street who decides all these questions for us. - This " man in the street " ? whether it be a city street or a village street , it matters not  --  is a person who acts on - certain vague feelings and instincts without much regard for strict- logic , historical perspective , or the'principles of political science as taught in the books . Matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless there be a war going on , when he devours all the harrowing details of destruction of life ancllproperty with the same interest that at home he follows the details of a prizefight or a football game But on'matters purely American lie entertains one or two-decided opinions . Speaking about a little unpleasantness caused by one Shays in the early history of Massachusetts , that profound statesman and levelheaded philosopher , never to be sufficiently admired by all true Americans , Mr. Thomas Jefferson , said ' " A little rebellion now and then is a good thing ; . . an observation of this truth should render honest republican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions as not to discourage them too much . It is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government . " " God forbid that we ' should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion  --  what signify a few lives lost in a century or two ? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . It is its natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen years since the above pious opinion was expressed , the average American citizen may have become less truculent and bloodthirsty , but it is pretty certain that at present he is not in favor of fertilizing the tree of liberty with any more human blood He is undoubtedly a peculiar sort of person , but he does not enjoy having bricks heaved at peaceful citizens while riding on street - cars , having- workingmen assassinated because they are - willing to work , or having hearses stoned because a- Labor Union does not approvethe funeral arrangements ! - How does - the man in the street know ' that either political party is responsible for these riots , commotions , " rebellions , " as Jefferson calls them ? He does not , but the papers that support the rioters , in Chicago at least , are Hearst newspapers , that loudly proclaim their Democracy . " Ergo , " says the man in the street . . . . The same crude logic couples the fact that the government of most American cities is unspeakably rotten with the fact that the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Democrats . " Ergo again , " says the man in the street . The things right under his nose are what interest the average citizen . In our large cities at least the Democratic party has often been singularly unfortunate , in its professed champions . , E. L. C M. Ortramso , October so , 1904. - PRESIDENTIAL ADVERTISING To THE EDITOR OF THE ) NATION : Sin : In current issues of a number of magazines and periodicals , whose circulations are enormous , there appears , among the advertising pages , a full page centred with the picture of President Roosevelt , and filled in with extracts from his utterances , together with favorable utterances from others concerning him and his policies . Thus does the self-respecting , dignified Republican voter see his idol placed before him along with baby powders , corn plasters , and salad dressings at so much per page . Such an undignified bid for support is an insult- to American manhood , a disgrace to our nation , and should cost the Republican nominee many , many votes . Yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 , 1904 We print the above because it illustrates the minor motives which may govern men in casting a vote for President when great issues are involved . South of Mason and Dixon 's line , Mr. Roosevelt 's spontaneous civility to a half-white man of national distinction is denounced in terms like those applied by our correspondent to campaign methods which , after all , are an.appeal to reason , and better than torchlight processions . And if we concede something to our correspondent 's sensitive regard for appearances , we would ask whether the r6clame of a personally conducted campaign is worse in Mr. Jtoosevolt than McKinley 's offering a. place in his Cabinet to the man who had paid his debts and made him President . The American public was not too nice to stomach that. ? ED . NATION . THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF POETRY . To THE EDITOR OP THE NATION : SIR ' " Browning 's characteristic poems do not give me pleasure of that sort which it is supposed to be the special function of poetry to give " This quotation from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent number of the American Historical Review , contains a generally accepted fallacy , and reveals the rock upon which many a critic has foundered and made shipwreck of his craft . I refer to the stated supposition that it is the special function of poetry to give pleasure : Not only does Mr Goldwin Smith , but numberless critics beside , including many writers- on rhetoric , arrive at conclusions from this false premise that in no wise explain the function of poetry . I think it may he said , with no attempt , or even desire , to derogate from ' the high esteem in which the eminent professor is justly held , that whoever argues that the primary function of poetry is to please , doss not understand poetry In making so sweeping an assertion , I am not unaware that perhaps three-fourths of the readers of poetry are animated , more or less , by this fallacy , which is as nonchalantly uttered and as stoutly maintained as if it were a truth , demonstrated beyond all possibility of dispute ; whereas , ultimately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might not use a stronger word It were certainly far from flattering to the body of earnest-minded men who make up the poets , to say of them that they have given the best that was in them to the primary end of pleasing . If the poets themselves are to be believed , the first and last aim of their work is , not to please , but to teach . In other words , the poet 's busmessris to see and reveal . It is as the Holy Spirit dictating to the lonely seer on the isle of Patmos , " Write what thou scent . " Only in so far as the poet heeds this injunction , obeying it as a good soldier obeys his captain 's order , and gives a faithful transcript of the vision , does he fulfil his high and holy once . This without regard to whether his transcript please or displease , I do not deny , however , that some sentiments , from being expressed in poetry , acquire a property ' of pleasing above that which they ordinarily possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like that which comes from the mating of sound to sense in the use of words . Do I seek to please men or God ? This the poet 's question always ; and ( I say it reverently ) the question was not answered with more undoubting , decisiveness by the - great apostle who propounds it than by the men who wear and deserve the name of poets . I know of no more conspicuous irony of human life than that , in view of the notable impulse given the-poets to everyraoral advance of the human race , they should still . , be - looked upon by the beneftciaries ; of their labors as beings who passed lightly through the byways of life , furnishing pleasant entertainment to others by the pretty flowers chance-gathered by the - roadside , instead of being looked upon , as indeed they are , as fellow-travellers who , contemplating this problem of human existence , saw it with clearer vision than we , and gave us the result of their sight or in-tight in the best and most heart-reaching words they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so , - not to trespass unduly on your space , allow me to cite at random , and from the poets themselves , some views relative to the function of poetry . I would recommend , in this connection , that the whole of Lowell 's Ode , beginning " In the old days of awe and keen-eyed wonder , " be thoughtfully read . This Ode I look upon , and I think rightly , as the clearest , most comprehensive , most mightily worded exposition of the function of poetry to be found in the English language , certainly in any American author . And while I suppose Mr. Goldwin Smith , and those who hold with him , would dismiss this Ode as a highly figurative work of the imagination , it is , nevertheless , the literal statement of a literal fact . " In the old days of awe and keen-eyed wonder , The Poet 's song with blood-warm truth was rife ; Be saw the mysteries which elide under The outward shell and skin of daily life . - Nothing to him vivre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , There was m - him no hope of-fame , no passion , But with calm , godlike eyes he only saw . ? ? ? Ent now the Poet is an empty rhymer , Who lies with idle elbow on the grass , And fits his singing , like a cunning timer , To all men 's pride and fancies-as they pass . " There is the picture of your pleasure purveyor . " Not his the song which , in its metre holy , Chimes with the music of the eternal stars , Humbling the tyrant , lifting up the lowly , And dray sun tha ? ugh the sours przson-bars . " The italicized clause in the last line tells what the true function of poetry is . Once more . I cite from Byron this : " When Athens ' armies fell at Syracuse , And fetter 'd thousands bore the yoke of war , Redemption rose up in the Attic muse , Her voice their only ransom from afar . " In either of these two cases , it will be observed that the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the far deeper question seems to have been insistently next these poets ' hearts . Always the question is : " Has the light broken in yourhearts ? or , Have you felt the divine uplift ? " . Lowell 's Ode was written when he stood at the threshold of his career . It was here he gave us to understand what we might reasonably expect from him . It is the statement by the architect of the building he proposes to erect , the propounding of the theory by which he meant to work . Long years after the writing of this Ode , when " Past my next mile-stone waits my seventieth year , " it is not improbable that the , man of gray hairs , and judgment cooled in the hard school of life , had discovered the shortcomings or the flaws in this youthful . hot-hearted ideal . Writing to his lifelong friend , George William Curtis , Lowell replies to the criticism that his poems ( meaning , I presume , chiefly the ' Biglow Papers ' ) had given , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters , it is the first function of poetry to give , the exact opposite of pleasure , namely , pain Deeply as Lowell the man deplecated the offence Which he had given , yet , being a poet , in the true sense of the word , he must " blurt ungrateful truths , if so they be . That none may need to say them after me . " Hear him further . " I hate to speak ; much more what makes the need . " But being , as I said , a poet , the spirit of inevitable necessity was laid upon him , and , at the risk of offending and alienating even those of his own household , he had to speak . Such , in brief , is my notion of what poetry is in its primary function  --  the making better of men 's hearts , as it were by fire , Of course , it is to be expected that this false premise of the pleasure-giving function of poetry , being foundational with the school of Mr. Goldwin Smith , Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this school on particular poets . Thus , when Mr. Smith says that Burns in a manner is not surpassed , he is merely juggling words , and tells us nothing about Burns or about poetry . Similarly , the mischief of this foundational fallacy crops out more glaringly in Mr. Smith 's almost contemptuous dismissal of Tennyson . " Tennyson has been called a great teacher ; but he has nothing definite to teach . " Does Mr. Smith mean that the apostle Paul has nothing definite to teach in that great passage , " We walk by faith , and not by sight " ? The laureate teaches the same . " Strong Son of God , immortal Love , - - Whom we , that have not seen thy face , By faith , and faith alone , embrace , Believing where we can not prove " And on through " In Memoriam " there is teaching of the most definite sort , if one has but the will to look for teaching instead of looking for pleasure . Think you Tennyson has nothing definite to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Often a man 's own stubborn pride is cap and bells for a fool " ? ? that there is nothing definite in the teaching that a man finds himself only when he loses himself and his will in the fathomless will of God ? " Thou seemest human and divine , The highest , holiest manhood , thou . - Our with are ours , we know not how ; Our wills are ems , to make them thine . " ? JAMES E. FRENCH .

To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In the latest issue of your paper is printed a pleasantly worded reference to the volume on ' Library Practice ' by Roebuck and Thorne , which is our publication for both London and New York . The writer of the notice says of the book that it " bears the imprint of Messrs Putnam , but is English made and intended . " The reviewer evidently writes under the impression that our publishing interests are exclusively American . It is the case , however , that since 1840 our house has had publishing interests In Great Britain , and during the past thirty years our books have borne the inprant of " New York and London .
