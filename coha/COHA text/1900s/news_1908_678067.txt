txt Declared Forgeries by Platt and Contained References to the Senator 's Affairs and His Sons . For over four hours yesterday Mae C. Wood , lawyer , school teacher , Government servant , newspaper woman , and selfstyled wife of United States Senator Thomas Collier Platt , the seventy-fouryear-old senior representative of this State in the Senate , matched her wits against those of John B. Stanchfield , counsel for Mr. Platt , in the suit which she has brought against the Senator for absolute divorce . At the end of the day 's proceedings she was still fighting hard in her cause , ? eith evasive replies and asides . The case is being heard before Justice O'Gorman in the Supreme Court . In her complaint Miss Wood set forth . that she was married to Senator Platt at the Fifth Avenue Hotel , this city , on ; Nov. 9 , 1901 , and she asks for a divorce on the ground of the defendant 's marriage to Lillian Janeway in October , 1903 . In. support of her marriage contention , she recently filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of totters from the aged Senator bearing on the marriage . Since these were filed , Senator Platt in an affidavit sub- . mitted to the court , declares the certificate and letters ate forgeries . Mae C. Wood is 42 years old . She is a small , determined looking woman , and although she confessed to Mr. Stanchfield that she gave up the legal profession because she found there was not enough money in it , her answers showed a keen knowledge of the law , which sometimes nettled and disconcerted the lawyer . She wore a costume of black and gray striped cloth . On her nose perched eyeglasses , which she frequently toyed with when giving a particularly irrelevant answer . At the opening of the trial Charles Le Barbier , her counsel , at once put her on the stand . She testified that she first met Senator Platt in April , 1901 . From that time forward she said she frequently sate him at the Fifth Avenue Hotel and at his office , 49 Broadway . It was in August , . 1901 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were sitting on the veranda of a Manhattan Beach hotel , she said . At that time she gave him no definite an- , ewer . but in the following November he renewed his sylt , and she accepted him . This was at the Fifth . Avenue EfoteL Later he told her of his desire for a secret marriage . " You know , I am an old man r and people will make fun of me , " she testified he gave as the excuse for a secret wedding . She agreed to this , and later received from Senator Platt a letter the text of which she said was : My Little Bride to Be : I have made all arrangements . You are not to say anything to anybody nor do anything but obey implicitly my instructions . You are to be here at 4 o'clock sharp . I inclose a card for you to give the hotel clerk , who will look after you and show you to Room 133 . You need not register .

When asked by Mr. Stanchfield if she had the original of this letter the witness said that Abraham H. Hummel and J. Martin Miller took It from her , with other papers , on Oct. 13 , 1903 . On the day set for the wedding , the Plaintiff said , she went to the Fifth Avenue Hotel . She was shown to Senator Platt 's room , and found him there . He embraced her , and then two men came in , One of them said to her , " Do you take this man to be your husband ? " She re plied she did . Then he asked Senator Platt a similar question , with the same result . All this time , she said , the Senator was holding her hand , and at the conclusion slipped a wedding ring on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , she testified , as the Rev. Mr. Rice . " Did you believe that the ceremony w2.9 a valid one ? " asked Mr. Lo Barbier . " I most certainly did , " she replied . Why , after the two men had left the room the Senator sat down on a sofa beside me , called me ' Baby , ' and gave me the marriage certificate . " She testified that she lived with the senator for two days . During that time he begged her not to make the marriage known , as his candidacy for the Senate , was near at hand , besides which , he said , people would call him an " old fool . " A copy of a letter which she swore she received from the Senator , dated July 2 , 1902 , was read . It ran : Dear Cathy : I have been thinking of you , and wondering how you are breasting the world alone . I am so miserable . I send you a book of franks . I did not think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frank and open . Sincerely yours , T. C. P. The plaintiff testified that she received many letters from Senator Platt , but that Mr. Hummel got them all from-her on Oct. 13 , 1903 , and that she had subsequently demanded the return of them from him , but he had refused to give them up . Other letters which she identified as receiving from Senator Platt were then read . One , dated September , 1903 , ran : My dear , dearest May , June-November 's bride : I wrote you yesterday not to expect too much from me in the way of writing these days on account of campaign matters . You are undoubtedly among many good friends and seem to be enjoying yourself . I want you to tell them all that you know a man back East by the name of Torn Platt , who is looking after your future , so they need not worry about you anyway . it pleased me to have you send the things on Pass No. 1 , but you will have to be careful of that when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer of the company you shall have No. 2 .

Numerous letters in the handwriting of Senator Platt and also her own were mown to her . She was asked to identify them . In some cases she disclaireed the authorship of those alleged to be in her own handwriting , or else fell I back on an evasive reply . She appeared much surprised as letter after letter was shown her , and frequently exclaimed tol Mr. Stanchfield . " How did you get hold of them ? ' The lawyer did not satisfy her curiosity , although promising- to do so before the end of the trial . Questioned About Dates . She was then questioned about a suit she brought in Omaha against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging conspiracy against her , and was also asked how she reconciled her statement that she was married to Senator Platt in 1901 , when two years after that date , as was stated in the complaint , which was read , she was engaged to be married to him . The plaintiff gave no direct reply . She testified that she was employed for some time in the Post Office Department at Washington , and for six weeks worked as a stenographer for the New York Central Railroad . She denied that she had ever retained a law firm of Richmond , Va. , to bring an action against Senator Platt , and when Mr. Stanchfield read a letter written by them to Platt stating that they had so been retained , in connection with an alleged breach of promise of marriage on his part , the plaintiff said she never authorized the law firm to write such a letter . In October , 1903 , the plaintiff said , she came to the Victoria Hotel , New York . There she met a man named J. Martin Millet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howe Hummel 's office . She declared that Miller arrested her .

You had better give up all the Platt papers . " On this , the witness said that , accompanied by Miller , she took all her Platt ' capers and went to Hummel 's office . She denied that she ever retained Hummel to bring suit against Platt , or that she authorized him to write a letter stating this to Platt . Mr. Stanchfield showed her a receipt dated Oct. 14 , 1903 . It read : " Received this day the sum of $10,000 in settlement Mae C. Wood . " " I did not receive that amount from Hummel , " she retorted , but admitted writing anything that she was ordered to by Hummel , saying that she knew it would be worthless , because she wrote under duress .
