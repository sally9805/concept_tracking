We have just seen Mr. Bryan at short range in New York , and no one can longer doubt what manner of man he is . Lord Eldon said in his old age , " If I had to begin life over again , hang me but I would be an agitator . " Bryan will never need to express such a regret . He is the boldest , most adroit , and one of the least scrupulous agitators that this country has ever seen on the national stage He is willing to become all things to all men if by any means he may win votes . For a time he essayed the dignified role of statesman , and showed his astonishing versatility as well as mental gifts in his brilliant and powerful Indianapolis speech of acceptance . But he could not stop with that . The shouting of the crowd sounded in the ears of his imagination , and would not let him rest at home . Against all advice , he began again his meteor-flights over the country , displaying once more the physical strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of appeal to prejudice and passion which would have left Danton himself agape with envy . Why is there any apprehension today regarding his success ? Why are business men compelled to take the possibility of Bryan 's election into their plans for the future ? It can not be that the American character has suddenly changed With all its vagaries , democracy has always preferred for its highest honors strong , cool , dignified , steady , and safe men . Why should there be any fear that a reckless stump-speaker , an adept in knock-down argument , a stirrer-up of social hatreds , should now command a majority of the suffrages of the American people ? Let alarmed Republicans give their minds to this question If they do it seriously and honestly , they will be compelled to acknowledge that the only weapons which are dangerous in Bryan 's hands were placed there by the men who have moulded Republican policy during the four years past . If Bryanism is a firebrand , it is Republicanism which has set it aflame . What are the two charges against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iteration ? First , that it has allowed organized and unscrupulous wealth to sway the policy of the general government ; second , that it has denied , on a gigantic scale , the fundamental rights of human liberty . Do not , impatient Republican reader , cry out that this is all calumnious nonsense Pause a moment , and reflect on the amount of truth there in to put the edge on Bryan 's charges Have you forgotten those letters demanding Government favors in return for campaign contributions to the Republican party ? Is it to be supposed that such revelations could fail to wake suspicions in the popular mind ? Will not people say that , if a few letters , accidentally published , showed such an attitude in men having close relations with the Republican leaders , the whole truth , if known , would confirm Bryan in asserting that Republicanism now means selling legislation for cash ? It was not a Democrat , but a stalwart Republican of the old school , who said bitterly in a Congressional committee-room , " You do not understand the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And it is not a raging domestic demagogue , but a clear-sighted and well-informed foreigner , Mr. Goldwin Smith , who declares that , to his mind , the main issue of our Presidential campaign is " that between Imperialist Plutocracy and the American Commonwealth . " We can not dismiss this as idle vaporing . Burke said that the local view of politics was always fifty years behind the times ? meaning that we can not properly estimate the forces at work until a half-century has passed But intelligent contemporary opinion of foreigners is the verdict of posterity , and we must not be so contemptuously incredulous as to Bryan 's wild and whirling words , when we find an observer of Goldwin Smith 's capacity asserting that there is an . element of truth in his most railing accusation . If Bryan 's open appeal to the jealousies and blind rage of the poor has any unusual force , it is because the Republican party has too openly sold itself for campaign contributions . And what a lamentable thing it is for the Republicans to be compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges them with trampling upon the rights of man ! His words bite because they are , in substance , true . The Republican party  --  the party of freedom , of enfranchisement , of equal rights for white or black  --  this is the party that has to stand by , silent and shamefaced , while this rude Democrat from the West indicts it for high crimes andmisdemeanors against liberty ' You may sneer at the sincerity of the rabble prating about liberty and independence . But if our elite , our educated men , our party of intelligence , abdicate , are we not bound to rejoice that even demagogues and the unthinking masses take up the cause of human freedom and the rights of the oppressed ? John Morley once drew an awful picture of the recreancy of the gentlemen of England to the sacred principles of English liberty , which , he said , had been kept alive by the despised lower classes . If our intelligent classes are ready to go over to an acquiescence in the new American slavery , we , for our part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envious , the dangerous classes , if you choose , are lifting their voices in protest . And the time will come , after election , when Republicans will call to a severe accounting those leaders who have betrayed the party into its present false position , and have made possible the portent of a Bryan , MR . BRYAN ON TRUSTS . Mr. Bryan , in his speech at Madison Square Garden , discussed the Trust question more at length than he has done in any other speech during the campaign . though less fully , perhaps , than in his speech at the Chicago Conference of last year . The remedy he proposed for the evils which he finds in Trusts was the same in both . He suggests that a corporation which acquires , or seeks to acquire , a monopoly of the supply of an article of commerce , shall not be permitted to do business in any State except the one in which it is incorporated , without a license from the Government of the United States ; and before that license is granted , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed out of the stock , and the corporation shall show that it is not trying to monopolize any kind of business . " He would also put on the free list of the tariff every Trust-made ar , tele . Mr. Bryan 's portrayal of the cruelties of monopoly was extremely pathetic , especially when he pictured the mother - watching over the cradle of her child and hoping that he may have a fair chance in the world and may make the most of life 's opportunities  --  a hope destined to be frustrated and brought to naught by the Trusts and monopolies that are growing up in every direction . That the Republicans are responsible for the Trusts and for all kinds of monopolies he affirmed as broadly as possible , saying that the President and his Attorney-General had neither enforced existing laws against Trusts nor recommended new ones , and that the party had sustained Mr. McKinley , and was about to vote for his reelection , in spite of his dereliction . In order to make the contrast between himself and his opponent more impressive , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a citizen than as a candidate , and more interested as the father of a family than as a Democrat . This was , no doubt , very taking to the miscellaneous audience to whom it was addressed , but it must have stirred the risible , s of the presiding officer of the Madison Square meeting . Not that Mr. Shepard has been the attorney of one or more Trusts , but because he is a man of a logical and legal mind , one who knows claptrap when he sees it , and has a pro-found contempt for it . It can not be af-firmed that the Republican party is more responsible for bringing Trusts into ex istence , nor for failing to put them out of existence , tha-u the Democratic party The earliest one ( Standard Oil ) was not in any sense political , nor was it based upon or helped by the tariff . The next one ( Sugar ) was started by men of Demo-cratic antecedents . It would have been started either with or without the tariff It is true that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens because there are more capitalists among Republicans than among Democrats . It is true also that many Trusts are protected by the tariff , and helped by it to maintain their respective monopolies . This artificial support ought to be taken from them , but it is fair to say that it was not given to them because they were Trusts . The tariff equally protects and helps industries that are not and can not be organized as Trusts . The Trusts did not have a political beginning , and they will not have a political end . They are an outgrowth of modern conditions of business , and they would have come just the same under any administration of the Government . An outgrowth may be good or bad , and we confess that this one is not at all to our liking . Evolution may be upward or downward , but if it is evolution , and is not the product of Governmental favor and interference , it should be treated like other products of evolution . The very first thing to be done is to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then see whether Government has anything in its armory fitted to cope with it , so as to do more good than harm . Mr. Bryan 's proposed license does not seem to us either useful or practicable . A Trust , as Professor Clark says , is any business combination which is large enough to be dangerous . This definition applies to the Carnegie Steel Company and to the Armour Packing Company as completely as to the Standard Oil Trust or the Sugar Trust . Whether any of these is dangerous is a matter of opinion , but they are all in the same boat . Now suppose that the Carnegie Steel Company were required to take out a Federal license before it could sell steel rails outside of Pennsylvania . Then , under Mr. Bryan 's plan , it would be required to do two things . first to squeeze all the water out of its stock , and second to prove that it is not aiming at a monopoly . As the latter is a requirement to prove a negative , it might be difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that they were trying to make and sell steel as cheaply as possible , and that their endeavors might lead to a monopoly or might not . The Carnegie Company is not technically a Trust . There is no water in its stock , because it was not formed by combination with other companies . It simply grew up by prudent management under favoring conditions . There are other steel companies which are Trusts , and probably there is water in their composition . Now , under the Bryan plan the Carnegie Company would be entitled to a license ( although it might not get one ) and the other steel companies would not . So the result of the plan , in this case , would be to make the Carnegie Company a monopoly by giving it an exclusive privilege in interstate commerce , where- as it is not such now . But supposing that , in order to avoid this absurdity , licenses were refused to all of them , what would be the condition of the buyers and consumers of steel ? What in like case would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were refused a license to sell outside of New Jersey ? Would not the Arbuckles then have a monopoly of the rest of the country ? PROSPERITY AND POLITICS . Senator Hanna 's speeches in the West have had for their burden the cry that prosperity is the one issue of the Presidential campaign . As a plain , blunt man , accustomed to buying and selling more than to oratory , he comes something short of ex-President Harrison 's ability to see a " spiritual significance " in the full dinner-pail If there are sufficient votes in it , that is all that Hanna wants . And there can be no doubt that , however coarse he may be in urging electors to vote as their stomachs dictate , he states truly the ultimate reliance of the Republican party in the pending contest . If times were bad , everybody knows it would be beaten . Glory , the Flag , Destiny , the Strenuous Life  --  none of these things could save it . Good business and good crops are its most effective stump-speakers . In a general way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that depressed trade or bad harvests always mean the defeat of a party in power . But is the converse true , and will good times infallibly enable a party to retain power ? ? Here we have to take stock of our knowledge of human nature Disgust and resentment are more powerful motives with political man than gratitude . Thus it is a fact , susceptible of historical proof , that while bad times invariably wreck a Government appealing to popular suffrage , good times do not necessarily save it . A cynical friend of ours has put the case as follows . " If my business is bad , I know it is wholly the fault of a wretchedly incompetent Government . Out with it ! But if I am making money , I am conscious that my success is due entirely to my own industry and sagacity . It is pure impudence in the Government to claim any share of the credit . " The Presidential election . of 1892 , when the country was greatly prosperous yet Harrison was turned out , is the instance most often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer of the present campaign can fall to see an important difference between the issue of pros - perity , as presented in 1892 , and as made prominent this year . Eight years ago warnings fell on deaf ears . The main reason was , we suppose , that the country had had an experience of prosperous Democratic rule , not so far back , and was not easily to be frightened . Now , however , the mental attitude is different . People - have too acute a remembrance of the disastrous years 1893-95 not to be open to argument , even if fallacious argument , on the need of voting so as to continue present prosperity . No one can say how many votes will be influenced solely by this kind of appeal ; but it seems undeniable that the number will be great . First voters  --  and there are to be 1,500,000 of them  --  will probably not be so easily wrought upon as those of longer memories ; but inquiry and report seem to leave it beyond question that thousands of workingmen and farmers will vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President is , no doubt , prepared to see in his reelection a great and gratifying endorsement of all that he has done ; but it is clear that , if citizens could eliminate his personality entirely , and vote an abstract ticket in favor of the gold standard and prosperity , the enthusiasm and the number of votes would be vastly greater It is an undoubted truth that McKinley 's Imperialist policy is preventing his party from reaping the full political harvest of prosperity . For it has been historically true of Anglo-Saxon political life that a remnant at least has stood for moral considerations and the principles of liberty , even when the country was prospering under an immoral and tyrannical Government . There have always been lofty-minded men who , like Clarendon , have had a soul above " the prosperous wickedness of these times . " And it was he , friend and supporter of Charles I. as he was , who could not refrain from pointing out that , while the King 's illegal ship-money left England highly prosperous , there was , with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition of the people to murmur and unquietness . " If such were not the case , we might well despair of liberty . One thing is certain : the Republicans who stake everything on the full dinner-pail to-day are placing a frightful mortgage on the future of their , party . They may win now , but what can they hope for when a poor crop or business depression  --  and poor crops and business depression will come as surely as the revolving years  --  coincides with an important election ? On their own showing , they will have no excuse , and can not complain when the voters turn them out neck and crop . It will be of no use to preach submission to Providence then . It is McKinley , not Providence , who has brought prosperity , and it is McKinley and his party who will have to suffer in times of adversity . All this raw talk about prosperity directly tends , in fact , to cultivate in the American electorate a Chinese frame of mind . When Sir Henry Blake , Governor of Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mandarin said to him , " The Emperor has kotowed four or five times for rain , and no rain has come . What good is he or the Dowager Empress for the Empire ? " Logic is logic ; and we may yet see McKinley kotowing for a big wheat crop at high prices , and his party beaten if he does not get it . DISTRUSTFUL CUBA . " My fellow-countrymen , they are preparing to cheat you ! " Such was the cry which fell from the lips of the veteran Cuban revolutionist , Gen Hernandez , at the commemorative banquet given in Havana on October 10 . It was the anniversary of the beginning of the first Cuban revolution  --  the " grito de Yara , " as the Cubans fondly call it . Many of the survivors of that heroic struggle were present . For ten years they had fought for independence , a generation ago ; again in 1895 they had renewed the unequal combat ; now with independence at last solemnly promised them by the great and Christian nation which had intervened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to find them exultant . But in fact they were filled with despairing apprehension . Speaker after speaker avowed his distrust of the United States . Major Secades asked how they could celebrate the , glorious 10th of October when a foreign flag floated above them with the " boastful air of being absolute- master " ? Gen. Castillo offered a toast to Cuban independence , " still so far away , and perhaps a tricky deception . " The fiery Than Gualberto Gdmez warned the people to be ready for a " critical day " when it might be necessary to imitate the Boers and make their land a wilderness rather than let it become the home of slaves . Gen. Hernandez , as we said , bluntly declared that the United States intended to cheat the Cubans . What are Americans to think of all this ? Is it a mere luxury of pessimism ? What more would these ungrateful , these distrustful Cubans have ? We drove Spain out of their island . We have maintained peace and order for nearly two years . We have set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose a Constitutional Convention , which is soon to meet to frame a scheme of independent government for Cuba . Is there not here every sign of good faith ? How can these irreconcilable Cubans impugn our honorable purpose ? Well , we suppose the reason is that they look to our acts rather than to our words . One ground which the Cubans have for distrusting us is that they can see how we deceived and abused the Filipinos . Such things can not be done in a corner . The native Cuban press has not failed to expound the ominous Philippine example . One trusting people bitterly disillusioned , as the Filipinos were , is , the Cubans say , a fine instance of the way the United States endeavors to " encourager les autres . " Moreover , they have significant words of influential Americans to point to as well as meaning acts . Senator Beveridge brutally declares in Chicago that our promise of independence to Cuba was made in a moment of impulsive but mistaken generosity ; and that , therefore , it - will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cienfuegos and Matanzas . It is true , then , exclaim the Cubans ; the Americans mean to play the rogue . As if to remove all doubts , the chief American newspaper of Havana , the Post , which poses , with good reason , as the chosen organ of the American military government , hastened to assert that " Mr. Beveridge makes no mistake . Cuba is certain to come definitely under our permanent jurisdiction . " Would not the Cubans be blind indeed if they saw no significance in all this ? Furthermore , the advance agents of American Imperialism are swarming to the island . To exploit land , mines , forests , public franchises  --  that is their one aim , and they cynically avow their expectation of being able to accomplish it under American sovereignty . There is just now a " Cuban Company " endeavoring , in spite of the Foraker law , to secure control of all the Cuban railways and to get the right of way for new ones . This company is , of course , an American syndicate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have nothing to do with it , since it is one of the agencies being used to rob them of independence . And this is but a sample of what is going on . Neely and Rathbone set the pace for American exploitation of Cuba ; and the sad sincerity of greed in which they wrought is the prevailing spirit , to Cuban observation , of most of the Americans who come to their island looking for investments . Ah , but the plighted word of this nation ; the renewed and solemn pledges of the Republican platform and of President McKinley 's letter of acceptance  --  is it not a gratuitous insult to us and to him for the Cubans to say that they do not believe we mean to do what we vow we will ? Well , if they do not believe us , whose fault is it ? We can not appeal to a reputation for telling the truth after we have been caught lying . The Cubans have studied not alone our conduct in the Philippines , but our playing fast and loose with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding promise to Cuba than he did to Porto Rico ; if he broke one , why should he not the other ? That is what the Cubans ask when they read what the President says about our " sacred guarantees " to Cuba . What , they sneer , can not sacred guarantees be swallowed as easily as plain duty ? Such a thing it is for a President to have destroyed confidence in his character , and so in the character of his country . It is painful for an American to read the flings of Cubans at American good faith , but what possible answer has he when taunted with an intention to cheat and deceive Cubans as Filipinos and Porto Ricans have been cheated and deceived ? For Cubans , the thing to do is to go on quietly with their Constitutional Convention . Whatever and however reasonable their doubts , it is for them to put us to the proof . We hope the members of the Convention will , in their first session , call upon President McKinley to annul his unprecedented and suspicious order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba and the United States . He had no color of title to impose such a condition upon them , and they should resent and repudiate it at the first opportunity . Even if this just ground of fear is not removed , the Cubans should proceed to draw up the best scheme of independent government they can devise . Then let them throw the responsibility on us . Americans who believe in such a thing as national honor , and who are cut to the heart to see a stain upon . it , will not stand idly by and see the President once more make us appear a faithless and godless nation . Whatever the popular majority behind McKinley , whatever the popular indifference to a new breach of trust , if it come , as it is evidently preparing , in Cuba , there will be Americans left to tell a party or a President drunk with Imperialism , as Machiavelli told the Italian Prince : " To betray one 's friends , to be without faith , without mercy , without religion  --  those are - perhaps ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMING ARMY CRISIS . Whatever the result of the Presidential election , it is already plain that no more pressing domestic question than that of the reorganization and increase of the regular army will present itself this winter to the Administration and to Congress . However much Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Bryan may argue as to past Republican intentions in regard to the army , and however much Secretary Root may affirm that the question of an . increase has not entered his head , the fact remains that some action must be taken by Congress if the Philippines are not to be practically abandoned . It is for Congress to decide in December whether the historic army policy of the United States is to be reversed , and whether or not our permanent land force shall be nearly four times what it was before the blowing up of the Maine . It may even be honestly asked if army officers are not correct who declare that 150,000 men must eventually be provided by Congress to keep our " conquered " Malays in a sufficiently pacified condition while the unsought benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for legislative action this fall arises from the requirement of the army law of March 1 , 1899 , which provides that the present regular army of 65,000 men shall shrink to its ante-bellum figure of 28,000 on July 1 , 1901 , and that the existing volunteer force of 35 , - 000 men shall be disbanded on or before the same day . This was a compromise measure , many Republican Congressmen having even then proposed a standing army of 100,000 men , and having been forced to accept the substitute partly because of the opposition of some of their own party like Representative Loud of California . At the time of the passage of this law , Gen. Otis was cabling that no volunteers would be needed . As late as June 1 , 1899 , he continued to hold his utterly mistaken opinion that only " 30 , - 000 troops will be necessary for the effecs tive control of the Philippines . " To-day , sixteen months or more later , Gen. MacArthur finds that his army of 71,000 men , exclusive of some 2,000 marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant demands for reinforcements made by his brigade commanders . The outlook for the speedy defeat and destruction of the " small portion " of the Filipinos reported in arms is , at this time , far less favorable than on August 12 , 1899 , when it was announced in Washington that " the President believes that Aguinaldo is making his last play , and I that the war will be over by November 1 1899 . " It is evident , therefore , that only the coming true of that cheerful campaign prediction that the Filipinos will give up dying for their cause on hearing that Mr. Bryan is defeated , will relieve the Administration of the necessity of having a large force in the Philippines to hold what territory has been won . No unbiassed student of the Filipinos , past and present , can believe that this will come to pass , and it must be noticed that Gen. MacArthur has not yet advanced this theory . If , as is alleged , the Filipinos are so fully informed as to what is going on in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American pen . pie will not be able to pass judgment at the coming election upon the Administration 's course in the Philippines because of the menace of Bryanism and of free silver . They must know also that those Americans who have dared to stand up and protest against the wickedness of shooting down men whose only crime is their desire to govern themselves in their own way , will not abandon their efforts to create an overwhelming moral sent , ment in favor of giving the Filipinos their independence without oualificar tion . But it is the necessity for the gradual withdrawal of the volunteer regiments , now scheduled to begin next month , which is the Administration 's most threatening danger . As the Filipinos see town after town abandoned by the retiring garrisons , for which Gen. MacArthur will have no substitutes , it will be surprising indeed if they are not encouraged to fresh outbreaks , and made to believe the Americans defeated . The longer Congress debates the question of an army bill , the more will Gen. MacArthur 's army be weakened before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the prospect perhaps of re-conquering towns for which much blood has already been shed . It is hard , indeed , to see how any additional troops can be sent to Manila to bridge over this interim , since Gen. Wood still retains 6 , - 500 men in Cuba , and the home garrisons have been reduced to 16,500 men , mostly artillery or fragments of regiments already in the Philippines . Nor will it be maintained that a Government which is preparing to force a Constitution upon an unwilling people will be exercising due foresight , according to the new diplomacy , if it deprives itself of the means to make the Cubans obey its will . Many questions must come before Congress which will make a hasty decision as to the size and make-up of the new army difficult . The Ordnance Board 's demand for 18,000 artillerymen to care for its costly forts and guns , which meets with Secretary Root 's approval ; the clamor for artillery and cavalry reorganization , in accordance with modern European methods ; the crying need of an amalgamation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter ; the need of more generals ; the question of giving volunteer officers commissions in the new army ; and , most important of all , the advisability of continuing the present makeshift army , partly regular and partly volunteer  --  these are but a few of the problems which must be properly solved if the reorganization is to be effective . Nor must it be forgotten that conflicting interests in the army itself create such difficulties that a joint board of line and staff officers to clear the way for some comprehensive plan has been suggested in many quarters . However much those affected by these details may be interested in their working out , the public at large will be most concerned in the determination of the principles involved . Whether the standing force is to be greatly enlarged at this time , and , if so , whether such action is in accordance with the noblest traditions of American life and with the safety and welfare of the Republic , is the important point at issue which will be most discussed . The taxpayer will not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28,000 men and his pension bill were together more than Germany 's outlay for her great army of half a million . Nor should he be unmindful of the fact that on July 1 , 1901 , $650,000,000 will have been paid out as the price of the war with Spain and of the criminal aggression in the Philippine Islands . It was James Russell Lowell who said that the United States would endure " so long as the ideas of its founders continue dominant . " They had no more dominant belief than that a standing army , other than for domestic police purposes , was a menace to the liberties of the people . HISTORY AND LITERATURE . History and literature , like elections and the weather , are always subjects to be discussed , but as the " silly season " is over , we ' should hardly select either of them for the text of a theoretical essay . There remains the relation between the two , a matter about which we are led to say something by the recent appearance of opinions which must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wylie delivered the Ford Lectures in the University of Oxford , speaking upon " The Council of Constance to the Death of John Hus " We shall criticise elsewhere the substance of these studies . At present we need only consider the brief L'Envoi in which Mr. Wylie explains his views concerning the composition of history and modern historical tendencies . ? Three days after we received Mr. Wylie 's lectures in their published form , Mr. Charles Francis Adams gave an inaugural address at the dedication of the building which the wisdom and generosity of Wisconsin have provided for the State Historical Society . The opening part of this address , which fifty years ago would have been justly called an oration , centred around the great issues of 1848 , the year when Wisconsin entered the Union . The State was first given its place in the scheme of historical evolution , and then the orator passed on to the same topics which Mr. Wylie touched in his closing words at Oxford  --  the composition of history , and modern historical tendencies . However , it is not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we place them side by side . Mr. Wylie and Mr. Adams regard the same question from different standpoints , and the contrast of their views may well afford students and teachers of history a theme for meditation Like Matthew Arnold , Mr. Wylie is " one of her Majesty 's inspectors of schools , " but to the world he is best known by his learned and detailed ' History of England under Henry IV ' This work has been praised on all hands for its erudition , but it has also been censured by more than one reviewer for its over-minuteness and want of literary style . At Oxford Mr. Wylie took occasion to answer his critics in a very charming and witty manner . He begins by citing ' Bishop Stubbs , who " once said of his own work that the useful part of it was hard reading and the readable part ' trifling , ' which would soon ' go the way of all fireworks . ' " This is a pretty bold argumentum ad homment , and Mr. Wylie proceeds : " But , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by storm and wins along the whole line , is a God-given gift . Those who have it can not fail to make it felt , while those who have it not would do well to make no effort to affect it . " Quite apart from his own confessed shortcomings , Mr. Wylie greatly prefers facts without style to style without learning . " We all know the old methods of the eighteenth century ' character sketches and fancy portraits , Thucydidean in scope and drawn to display the wordy skill of the draughtsman ; lofty and often contradictory generalizations , all based upon the same meagre- stock of knowledge ; a modicum of well-worn . facts tricked out in varying degrees of picturesqueness . " Mr Wylie thinks that minuteness has not hitherto been the bane of history , and he is apparently satisfied to live at the dawn of that documentary age - which , in the words of Lord Acton , " will tend to make history independent of his . torians , and to develop learning at the expense of writing . " Nothing could be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , says Mr. Wylie , " it put fresh life into the treatment of the whole field of English history , and did not in the end destroy the delight of students any more than the discovery of the Assyrian bricks or the Moabite stone " It will be quickly seen that we are not stating the ideas of one isolated scholar . Opinions like those which have Just been quoted are entrenched in our leading universities The typical American professor of history might , if the research method were accused of making books dull , reply in borrowed phrase that " there are worse things than dulness  --  worse if that which professes to be history is no history at all " Moreover , and here we reach the practical issue , our scheme of college teaching is grounded upon the conception that the proper study of the past began with Leopold von Ranke . Whatever outward respect may be shown the " classical " historians of Greece , Rome , and modern Europe , their masterpieces are left untouched by the undergraduate because he is engaged in exploiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views which Mr. Adams expressed at Madison . Indeed , we have kept them chiefly in mind from the . start . Mr. Adams is strongly convinced that the research system of historical instruction has been carried beyond the normal point in American universities At the end of his address , he turns towards the ideal historian of the future , whom he expects to be a greater benefactor than any President or politician , and describes his qualities " He must be a prophet and a poet , as well as an investigator and an annalist . He must cut loose from many of the models and most of the precedents of the immediate past , and the educational precepts now so commonly in vogue . He must perplex the modern college professor by asserting that soundness is not always and of necessity dull , and that e " , en ' intellectual sobriety may be carried to excess " Nor does Mr. Adams hesitate to describe the nurture of the true historian . " Becoming more of an artist , rhetorician , and philosopher than he now is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a word , going back to Moses , Thucydides , and Herodotus ; Tacitus , Gibbon , and Voltaire , Niebuhr , Macaulay , Carlyle , Buckle , Green , Mommsen , and Froude , he must study their systems , and , avoiding the mistakes into which they fell , thoughtfully accommodating himself to the conditions of the present , he must prepare to fulfil the mission before him . " Between Mr Wylie and Mr. Adams , what is to be the fate of the undergraduate ? Mr. Wylie says : " Henceforward our backs are to be ruthlessly turned on the old barren generalizations , and we are to look on no detail as trivial which tends to supplement our scanty knowledge of the past " Mr Adams says " I distinctly look back with regret to that more spiritual and more confident time when we , of the generation now passing from the stage , drew our inspiration from prophets , and not , from laboratories . " Here is the parting of the ways . Shall the undergraduate , from the start , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shall he master the historians in Mr. Adams 's list , and others of the next lower rank ? For our own part we think Mr. Adams 's contention just , and we have no scruple in saying so . He would be the last to scorn the appliances of scholarship or to deny the value of facts . But appliances are merely a means , and facts are merely data . We shall not take the tone of an alarmist and say that the undergraduates of our large colleges are made bibliographers and nothing more . They learn much useful method and may imbibe a love of sheer historical truth . The pity is that they are caught too young . When they should be reading the funeral speech of Pericles , even in Jowett , they are preparing " special reports " As a disciplinary exercise , history is far from being the best possible training . It helps the youth most by enlarging his horizon , by firing his imagination , by quickening his sympathies , and by prompting him to great actions through the contemplation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impart the " hard , gem-like flame " of historical inspiration , but all can at least point out the authors who have best succeeded in realizing the nature of this inspiration . The compilers of good Jalbrbficher have their own honorable place , but they should not be - the first hr chief guides of the undergraduate We would neither seem too earnest nor press our opinion too far We simply think that most American universities at present exalt the great methods above the great writers . We , like Mr Adams , look forward with hope to the time when the historian who shall at once be the ' truest product of the university and the surest leader of public opinion , will speak with " An eloquence scarce given to mortals , new And nndebased by praise of meaner things . " THE LACK OF OPPOSITION . I have often discussed with Englishmen , during the last few years , the question why we have no organized opposition in America Ever since the civil war , any attempt to oppose the party in power has been generally futile or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last shreds of respectability vanished from the opposition , so that at last the Republican party was able to win and divide the offices with such a makeshift as McKinley . I think the matter may be explained by simple observation of what has happened within the last few months . McKinley had committed some of the most flagrant errors ever committed by a party man . He had , violated all the most revered American traditions The consequence was that he was violently opposed in the beginning by some of the most prominent American citizens , as one might have expected . They accused him of crimes against the American commonwealth which all the best political writers with whom I am acquainted have pronounced unpardonable . They are crimes such as I have never heard of being forgiven by an enraged people . Well , ' all these crimes have been overlooked by these very men They all say they believe all they have ever said about McKinley , which showed him to be the most unfit man who ever filled a great place in a civilized country , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Something of the same kind occurred after Cleveland 's election . He was promptly abandoned by the men who helped to elect him , and who would , it was supposed , form the nucleus of a reform party . They quickly disbanded , and ceased to take any interest apparently even in him , or in the things for which he stood . Here is the explanation of our failures as reformers We are reformers for only one election , and if that election does not reform , we disperse to our homes like the old French arrtAre-barn , and say we have had " enough of politics , " and nothing more is heard of the reform for years . We then occupy ourselves in that favorite American fashion , by making apologies for the man who has got the place , no matter who he is or what he does . We begin our excuses for him with the phrase , " Oh , well now , " and generally predict a fall of stocks if our attempt should be repeated . Bad as McKinley is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who ii so foolish as to care what has become of the American commonwealth or reputation if there has not been a fall of stocks ? The morale of a party strikingly resembles that of an army . As in an army , each member of it has to feel sure , if discipline is perfect , not simply that he will stand fire himself , but that his comrades may be depended upon to do the same thing ; and , above all , that his leaders may be safely followed as persons who have considered the whole situation , and know that their position is a sound one . An army whose generals took occasional service with the enemy could not hold together for three months . It would not do for them to tell the troops , now and then , that the enemy was a good fellow and meant well , and ought to have another trial . The gentlemen I have spoken of have been demonstrating , with all their force and eloquence , for the last year or two , that McKinley was committing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution . A more complete disqualification than they have proved , of the man 's unfitness for any high public position , it would be impossible to make . And yet they are now telling the people who believed in them , who followed them , who trusted them , that it was " all gammon and spinach , " that McKinley is not such a bad fellow , after all , and that he ought to have another chance to massacre a distant unoffending people , to lay waste their property , to violate his own Constitution , to demoralize the American army , to spend the public revenues in criminal enterprises . The situation reminds us of , Tacitus 's report of the way the Roman nobility " rushed into servitude " under Tiberius , when they felt sure that he had " euchred " them . I have long held the opinion that American youths receive their education in politics and morals far more through seeing how their elders behave than through books or teachers or religious instruction . Nowadays what a boy receives from his teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through association with his father and his father 's friends . He is influenced greatly by the way he sees the machinery of state carried on by conspicuous men , and by the way in which persons whom he respects as orators and statesmen and executive officers administer their trusts or speak their sentiments . In fact , the reason why men like the gentlemen I have mentioned take the trouble to make public their opinion about McKinley or Bryan , or the acts of Government generally , is because they think those opinions will influence hundreds and thousands of young men . But what if these great men do not hold the same opinions for more than two or three months at a time and show plainly , and do n't mind who sees it , that their opinions can be bought , like the rest of their possessions ; that the prospect of a place , the honor of a , title , a compliment from party confederates , the prospect of a little business gain , or the mere comfort of being in accord with people they meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about public affairs , and the character and competency of the persons who administer them , at the shortest notice ? What is to be the future of a democracy that has no steadfast guides on whom it can rely ? Can such a state of things be properly described by anybody but Offenbach ? E L G
