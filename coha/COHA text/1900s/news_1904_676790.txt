txt In the remarkable account given yesterday morning in the dispatches of The London Times and THE NEW Your TimEs from the Japanese Left Army of the operations of Gen. Oku south and southwest of Liao-Yang , American readers learn for the first time in detail of the Japanese mode of fighting in this war . The account , filling four columns of the paper , was rendered by a competent observer , and was intensely interesting . The sum of this observer 's comment is that there was a tremendous and in some degree a useless expenditure of life by Gen. OKU . Three desperate assaults of the strongly fortified Russian positions were made within twenty-four hours without advancing the position of the Japanese appreciably . A fourth on the next morning yielded no better results . Then followed al final effort with the artillery , and at last the Japanese took possession of the city . The estimate of 20,000 is probably a moderate one of the awful loss endured in this stubborn attack , and it is evidently the opinion of our correspondent that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of warfare has such slaughter been incurred with so little immediate advantage . The imagination is staggered at the conception of the utter recklessness of life shown as well by the soldiers as by the commander of the Japanese Army , and their heroism is matched by that of the Russians . It was undoubtedly the purpose of the Japanese Commander in Chief to cut off the retreat of Gen. KuP.OPATION and to force him to surrender or to escape at terrible-disadvantage . In the former purpose he failed , and to that extent his awful sacrifices must be held to have been in vain . On the other hand , it is equally plain that the purpose of ** when he learned that KuROICI had crossed the Tai-Tse , was to attack him , crush him , and return to attack the remainder of the Japanese forces , exhausted and reduced by the five days ' continuous assaults upon his works around Liao-Yang . In that purpose he was foiled by the greater swiftness and energy of KuRoY.1 and by his superiority in numbers at the point of meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their large plan . For the Russians it was equally failure in the advantage hoped for from the division of their enemy . The net result , however , was defeat for the Russians and a decided though not a decisive victory for the Japanese . The point selected by lituoPATKIN for a firm stand , which he had fortified in the strongest possible manner , where he had concentrated all the troops available , where he had planned to check the advance of the three armies converging against him , and whence he had hoped to roll them back and close the campaign with a victory that would make Liao-Yang the last point in Japanese progress and the first from which to begin Russian aggression , had to be abandoned . The position which appears to have been impregnable to direct attack was rendered untenable by a flanking movement . Whether the Japanese loss was repaid , Whether it was justified by the usual reasoning of military experts , is , of course , a question we are not competent to answer . Clearly it was an awful price to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actual advantage was secured , and could not have been attained without it . KUROPATIUs would not have abandoned Liao-Yang if KuRoxi had not threatened his rear , and KURORI could not have crossed the river in force sufficient to compel KUROPATKIN to abandon Liao-Yang if the Russians had not been held by the furious and unremitting assaults in front of that city . Had the Japanese contented themselves with slower operations south of the river the Russian position would have grown steadily stronger and the flanking movement would have become more and more difficult . If we consider the alternative and the actual results attained , it is not easy to see how the Japanese mode cf fighting can be unqualifiedly condemned . Assuredly no one can read the thrilling dispatches to which we have referred without realizing that a nation has arisen as to ' whom the ordinary calculations of the limits of adventure in warfare do not hold . And the dispatches we publish this morning -- not less authentic , and quite without precedent in the reporting of the war so far confirm this impression .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
