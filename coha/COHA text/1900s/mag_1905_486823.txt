There is no theory on which such an age is desirable , except that the preparatory school is equivalent to the German gymnasium , and that undergraduate work is true university work . On the contrary , the very best preparatory school is not parallel to the gymnasium , and the graduate of twenty-three is only just entering the long road to science or medicine or the law . Neither in Germany nor in our own country ' has the young man time lying idle on deposit to honor such drafts . Thoughtful parents and professional men began to see the consequences with dismay . The next step , then , was to abridge the college course , to cut it down to three years at Harvard , to threaten two years at Columbia . But if the college offers a highly expert training , why abridge the boon which it confers ? The fact is , that the college should still form a bridge between the ordinary high schools of the country and the real university or the advanced technical school . The average high schools can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare for Harvard are not matches for the gymnasia , though probably it was once hoped that they might be . They are , in fact , out of relation with the general secondary-school system of the country , as President Hadley has recently pointed out . We can not duplicate the German school system , excellent as it may be for the Germans . The place of their gymnasia is filled partly by our high schools , partly by our colleges ; but our best equipped colleges add many subjects which suit perfectly our own conditions of life . Princeton and Yale still profess for undergraduates the programme of general culture which marks the scope of Amherst or Williams . The two thousand undergraduates of Harvard , with a preliminary.training inferior to that of the gymnasia , enjoy practically that unfettered freedom of choice which the Germans reserve for the university alone . The life which is pictured in this memoir had little in common with the unsentimental semi-military grind of a German gymnasium . Its freedom , in spite of occasional escapades , is certainly in harmony with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sentiment to the life and studies which are illustrated in this volume  --  at great length , it is true , yet we will not say at excessive length , for the story appeals to the pious memories of the family of Hamilton alumni . An Etonian might feel a similar sentiment for Eton , or a Balliol man for his college . A natural peril of the good and efficient small college is that it is liable to prosper and become a large college . It the roots are strong and solid , the branches are likely to spread . This fate it can hardly decline or shun  --  it is the usual reward of merit . Harvard has already met this doom , and has parted long since with the good fellowship of the class system . Dartmouth and , perhaps , Williams are in danger of the same overgrowth , if it may be so called . There is a real misfortune in parting with that intimacy of intercourse with students and instructors which our minor colleges fostered . At Cambridge and Oxford an ideal balance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breadth of the University . The student has his own little planet to dwell in , which is part of the planetary system of the University . The defect of the country college with us is a certain insularity and narrowness  --  a slight danger of provincialism and stagnation  --  which the association with a great university tends to correct . The great university , on the other hand , does not necessarily secure a wide social life and experience for the undergraduates . It may , on the contrary , precipitate the young student into little cliques and eddies , he may be isolated almost completely and revolve about his own individual axis , a solitary , unsocial atom . But the graduate from the narrower life of a small college may enlarge his horizon in the professional schools or the post-graduate work of a large university . This is now becoming the rule ; it is a liberalizing influence , to be compared with the habit of migration in the German universities . Part of a Man'a Life . By Thomas Wentworth Higginson . Boston : Houghton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of Colonel Higginson to live in the days of Cato the elder , how surely he would have been immortalized in the pages of the ' De Senectute ' as a shining example of a delightful and useful old age , busily engaged in recording for posterity the garnered wisdom of more than eighty years , and abundantly supplied with physical and mental strength for his task , thanks to an earlier life intelligently and honorably self-controlled . If Colonel Higginson has never ascended the heights of purely creative literary genius , he has none the less made for himself in American letters a place of high honor and a name that will not readily be forgotten . The chapters of the present volume range over many fields : " Butterflies in Poetry " and the Negro Problem ( " Intensely Human " ) are chapter topics objectively as widely separated as one could well imagine . But , seen through the mind of Mr. Higginson , there is a very substantial unity in the work after all , and the wording of the title ? " part , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the privilege of a really capable life lived up to its opportunities to make itself a part of all that it has met , and to make all that it has met a part of itself ; and the life with which we are brought into contact here has lived fairly up to its opportunities . Two chapters stand out in bold relief for their bearing upon social , moral , and political problems of the present day  --  the one , just mentioned , dealing with our relations with the negro ; the other , " The Cowardice of Culture , " with the chronic distrust on the part of the cultured classesin the ability of the less favored to develop the fundamental qualities of good citizenship . Mr. Higginson takes radical and well-grounded issue with the theory , too prevalent even at the North , that the negro is rightly understood only by the classes to whom he was formerly in bondage . Even a recent biographer of Whittier has said , " Of the real negro , his capacities and limitations , he had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely on theoretical speculation . " In Whittier 's case it would not be difficult to show the possession of a remarkably true insight , even at rather long range : his study of the character of John Randolph had not been that of personal contact , and yet his verses on " Randolph of Roanoke " constitute one of the most truthful and effective bits of character delineation ever compressed within the same space limits by an American writer . But , as Mr. Higginson shows , the cause of the negro against slavery did not rely upon supporters who took their evidence at second band , or based their action on abstract speculation . Lundy , Rankin , Garrison , Birney , Channing , and the Grimic'es had ample and long accumulated evidence from the sight of their own eyes to sustain on grounds of fact the theoretical opposition to which reason and moral principle had forced them . Tacitus speaks somewhere of our increased bitterness towards those for whom our enmity has no just basis . The slave himself had done no harm to those who held him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus , the owner had done himself harm irreparable and beyond description . He had placed himself athwart the track of advancing moral and industrial civilization . The incubus of the system had left him the insight to foresee the impending disaster , but not the moral energy to make the sacrifice by which alone it could be averted . Under such circumstances , condemned at the bar of civilization for holding the negro in bondage , we may allow that the holders would have been something more than human had they not tried to mitigate their own position by persuading themselves that the negro was something less ; but at the same time we can not allow ourselves to forget that such an attitude of mind inevitably unfits one to be an impartial judge of the question at issue . Mr. Higginson maintains that our troubles over the negro are to be put on the road towards removal only by full recognition of the fact that the negro , like the white man , is simply a human being , " intensely human " both in his virtues and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of negro troops in the civil war , a movement in which he was the pioneer , it never occurred to him to treat his soldiers or think of them on any other basis , and his confidence in their ordinary humanity was unswervingly justified by results . It would be of untold value to the South to-day to read and digest the calm and sane counsels of this chapter . The chapter on the Cowardice of Culture has gained immensely in its power of suggestion since it was written , now that fear of another kind has broken away the barriers of an exclusive aristocracy , and at one stroke converted millions of the uncultured masses of Russia into effective units in the government of an empire known to possess latent possibilities of a wealth and power immeasurably beyond what it has yet attained , even though no slightest part of its bureaucratic dreams of external expansion should ever be realized . The faith of many will be sorely tried by the disorders sure to attend the period of readjustment , just as the faith of many Northern patriots has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negro citizenship . Our troubles with the negro have been born of the cowardice which would not trust him , which has given him not a genuine freedom , but , a half-freedom " tempered by chain-gangs , lynching , and the lash . " If we are not in a position to lend Russia the moral aid which she so sorely needs from us to-day , it is because we have let the vicissitudes of a needless war and of party politics drive us into the practical maintenance of the position that self-government is not an ultimate and beneficent principle of political philosophy , but merely a convenient instrument for use in certain high stages of civilization , best kept out of reach of the weaker races . It should be needless to call attention to the fact that , on the theory which we are to-day applying to the government of the Filipinos , the masses of Russia ought to be better governed by the bureaucracy than by themselves . It will be fortunate for the new regime if its more liberal leaders imbibe the spirit of our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meshes of a suicidal expediency . " I take it , " Mr. Higginson says , " that there has never been a period in our history since the American nation was independent when it would not have been a calamity to have it controlled by its highly educated men alone . " We have recently learned from the reminiscences of Andrew D. White what a high degree of personal culture some of the leading official spirits of reactionary Russia had developed ; and yet the recent war has thrown these same officials upon the screen before the eyes of an onlooking world as examples of an almost incredible and altogether disastrous inefficiency . We get , then , from Mr. Higginson the doctrine that the cure for the troubles of democracy is more democracy . We have taken up our space with the suggestions of these two chapters under the conviction that they convey important truth admirably adapted to present needs . Of the twelve chapters unnoticed we shall merely say that the reader will find delight and profit in them all .

By Thomas Franklin Waters , President of the Ipswich Historical Society . Published by the Society . 1905. 8vo , pp. 686 . In one feature , at least , this ample and handsomely printed work surpasses any other town history that we have ever encountered . We refer to that portion of the second half which deals with " Houses and Lands , " and which , with the aid of a diagram , traces the fortunes of each dwelling and lot of the original settlers nominatiin not only to 1700. but to tee present day . This enormous labor is fortifiedby the citation of wills and deeds , and the result is a firm base for all future researches . It is supplemented by a summary of the names of the settlers from 1633 to 1649 , with the year in which each name first occurs in the town records , and by some sample inventories of personal effects . Other remarkable lists of the early inhabitants have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; and show that out of an enrolled male population in 1678 totalling 508 , there were 220 commoners and 125 freemen ( 17 of these not being commoners ) . The freemen alone were entitled to vote for the officers and magistrates of the Colony and to speak and vote in town meeting ; the commoners Might vote on all questions relating to the common lands ; the residue , so-called Residents , were eligible for jury duty and to vote for selectmen . " Probably , " says Mr. Waters , " there was no nation of the Old World where the lines of division between the rich and the poor , the learned and the unlearned , the master and the servant , were drawn more sharply . The aristocracy of old Ipswich was as definite and as haughty a body , it may be , as the aristocracy of London . Nevertheless , the test of eligibility to full citizenship resided not in gentle birth , or in the possession of wealth or learning or official station , but in Christian manhood , publicly professed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant was not debarred from this privilege of church membership , and the right of franchise followed naturally from this . " The Saltonstalls , Jahn Winthrop , jr. , whose portrait serves for frontispiece , the Rev. Nathaniel Ward , the Rev. Nathaniel Rogers , the Rev. John Norton , Samuel Appleton , Anne Bradstreet , and Ezekie , Cheever , are the more famous names associated with the early period of Agawam , or Ipswich . Three of these were graduates of Emmanuel College , Cambridge , and the younger Richard Saltonstall , a man of great independence of mind , honored his breeding by protesting to the General Court against the importation of two kidnapped Guinea negroes in 1645 , advocating imprisonment for the shipmaster and the return of the slaves at the public expense .

Valuable letters of Ward 's are printed in an appendix . Mr. Waters 's historical treatment is episodical and is very pleasingly manifested in the opening chapters on the aborigines as described by the first Englishmen and on home and dress . These themes are invested with a really fresh interest , and set forth with noticeable literary skill . In an Indian shell-heap supposed traces of cannibalism have been found . The town checked the cutting down of trees , even on private house lots , by the most stringent regulations .

Towards Andros the town was disposed to be compliant , though it resisted his Tax Act till forced to submit . It was spared Salem 's witchcraft delirium , and the victims in Ipswich were few . Much remains to be said or sayable , but we must stay our hand . Mr. Waters 's work , which we hope he will follow up for later times , as he half promises , takes its place in the front rank of its class , and can hardly be praised too highly for diligent research , candor , taste , style and construction . Except for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printer has performed his part very commendably . The Political History of England . By W. Hunt and R. L. Poole . Vol . X. From the Accession of George III . to the Close of Pitt 's First Administration . By W. Hunt . Longmans , Green &; Co. 1905 . The example set by Lord Acton with the Cambridge Modern History has inspired a group of Oxford scholars to emulation . With the assistance of Dr. Hodgkin , Professor Adams of Yale , and Professor Pollard of London , and under the very competent joint leadership of the editor of the English Historical Review and of the president of the Royal Historical Society , they propose to cover the political history of England from the earliest times to the present in twelve volumes . The inherent defects of cooperative historical writing have been too frequently reiterated to require restatement here , but it may be said at once that the present undertaking is a great improvement on the Cambridge Modern History in this respect , that each volume is the work of one author instead of a patchwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may further be said that there is a distinct need for a comprehensive political history of England , condensing into a convenient form the results of the very active scholarship of the present day . In the accomplishment of the latter purpose , however , the general reader might well expect to find controversial questions treated in as definite and thorough a manner as possible . In the volume now published there are several questions of the sort dealt with , notably two to be hereafter mentioned . It can not be said that the reader is left with the impression that he has been presented with a thorough and authoritative judgment in either case . This volume . the first to appear , but the tenth in number , is by the Rev. William Hunt , and embraces the reign of George III . down to the year 1801 . On the ' , Abele it may be said that the work is solidly and satisfactorily done , although a period containing two great revolutions N as perhaps not that best adapted to the author 's talent . Mr. Hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his scholarship , which , perhaps , is not an equal merit . He is far removed from Sir George Trevelyan 's outlook on the question of American independence , and his hero , if he has one , is George III . There is something to be said for this position ; and even for those who will not agree it may serve as a useful corrective . But , all allowance made , it is clear that Mr. Hunt lacks the breadth of vision , the catholicity of mind , without which a revolution , with its inevitable exaggerations. can not be judged . Thus , we find him within a few pages describing Chatham 's rhetoric as " sublime , " and the Declaration of Independence as " crude " ; the epithets might perfectly well be reversed , though with no better justification . It is the same with the French Revolution ; to Mr. Hunt it is still a " byNi ord . " The Declaration of the Rights of Man he takes pains to describe as " flatulent " ; is it possible that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter of liberty ? He would be surprised to find that , making exception of a question of legal procedure specified in clause 9 , it does not require a word changed to fit the political conditions that France has attained under the Third Republic . The fact is , that Mr. Hunt suffers from a constitutional incapacity which makes him unable to deal with such questions on a broad enough basis . In other respects there is little fault to find with his work . It is packed as full of fact as his space will permit , and it is not often that his knowledge or judgment appears to err . His description 0 General Howe as " incompetent " is , however , not justifiable . At page 121 , Lady Sarah Gordon-Lennox , whom George III . for a time wanted to marry , is described as the cousin of Charles James Fox ; she was in fact his aunt . Franciscans ( p. 35 ) , for the believers in Sir Philip Francis as Junius , is not a commendable use of a term which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pinch , with the Hell Fire Club . On the identity of Junius , Mr. Hunt does not , as he might be expected to , give us an authoritative summing up . He dismisses the subject in a few words , and with a statement to the effect that the authorship of Sir Philip Francis is generally unquestioned . That is going too far ; it was certainly not the opinion of the late Mr. Fraser Rae . Another highly controversial question is also dealt with insufficiently , that of Nelson 's conduct at Naples in 1799 . In this matter Mr. Hunt , with an evident desire to be fair , goes further in criticism of Nelson than most English historians , but he does not show a firm grasp of the crucial points in the evidence , and he misses Mr. Badham 's works in his authorities . On the whole , however , these are minor defects in a very useful book , in which the sense of proportion , the volume of information , and the continuity of narrative are good . Mr. Hunt shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " Social and Economic Progress . " Florence . By A. Philippi . With 170 illustrations . Translated from the German by P. G. Konody . ( Famous Art Cities , No . IV . ) Charles Scribner 's Sons . 1905 . The modern traveller who previously prepares himself for seeing Italian cities by an attentive study of monographs andillustrated guide-books , must resign himself to eliminate surprise from his pleasurable sensations ; on the other hand , he can , by knowing the architectural structure of the principal monuments , the outlines of sculpture and paintings , devote his time more efficiently to what interests him most . Philippi 's ' Florence ' will be found equally useful for study beforehand and for an aide-memoire . Its lightness makes it especially easy to carry about . In commendably brief space the author gives us a comprehensive survey of Florentine history , the part played by all its leading citizens both in politics , literature , and art , the origin of all its important buildings , with extensive architectural notes about them and excellent illustrations of its churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and noteworthy details . It is in the lives of Florentine painters and the descriptions of their principal works that Philippi is least instructive . His digressions into art criticism are too palpably futile . For instance , with regard to Botticelli , although he is accorded a prominent rank among painters , we read that , while a brilliant designer , his drawing is not correct , nor his vision pictorial , nor is he a colorist . Moreover , he did not attempt to make the objects he painted appear " plastic and round , " nor to make space recede , nor was he interested in the landscape behind his figures  --  all singular accusations , which prove that Philippi does not recognize style in drawing , or know the first principles of decorative art , nor has he observed the wonderful space and breadth in the landscape of winding-river background to " The Annunciation " in the Uffizi , which is not among his illustrations of Botticelli 's works . He goes on to say : " In spite of these imperfections , he impressed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public that would not think any less of him if one were to say that he was really no painter , but a draughtsman and illuminator : the more wonderful , the greater , they would say , his art . " Philippi carps also at what he calls the restlessness of Botticelli  --  in other words , his faculty for dramatic expression . In the movement of his figures he esteems Ghirlandajo as far the greater artist and painter of the two . These individual appreciations are in no wise helpful to any one . In treAting of Raphael , we are bade base our judgment of his skill as a portrait painter on his paintings of Angelo and Maddaleno Doni in the Pitti Gallery . Yet further on we are told they they are not attributed to that master . The book suffers from being crudely translated from the German . Essays . By Robert , Marquess of Salisbury . Vol . I. , Biographical . Vol . II. , Foreign Politics . E. P. Dutton &; Co. 1905 . " The essays in these volumes , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Lord Salisbury to the Quarterly Review in the years 1861 to 1864 , when the author was Conservative Member for Stamford , and before he had been in office . " We may add a further word of explanation , in stating that , with the exception of two long articles on Stanhope 's ' Pitt , ' both volumes are occupied with pa-pers on diplomatic subjects . The review of Castlereagh 's career does , indeed , embrace a certain amount of biographical comment , but the author 's main concern is to estimate the services of a minister who did his most important work at the Foreign Office . The other three essays deal with " Poland , " " The Danish Duchies , " and " Foreign Policy . " Throughout , Lord Salisbury is writing as a champion of Tory principles and Tory leaders . Even his essay on " Foreign Policy " is less a statement of the leading ideas which should determine national action than a sharp criticism of Lord John Russell . The love of sarcasm and epigram which marked Lord Salisbury 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated in the course of these essays . Lord Castlereagh , for example , was cold and impassive , but Salisbury could not dismiss this side of his character without bringing in a dig at the Whigs . " He had his own notions of what good there was to be done , and what was the best way of doing it ; and neither contradiction at home nor coaxing abroad ever moved him a hair's-breadth from his own Particular point of view . But they were such unpoetical , unromantic notions that no one could , by any stretch of language , dignity them as ' a cause . ' " This allusion to " causes " furnishes an excellent opportunity for a side-glance at the sentimentalism of those who had learned their political alphabet in the school of Fox : " He might have maintained his policy with impunity if in his speeches he would have done readier homage to the Liberal catch-words of the day . If he had only constructed a few brilliant periods about nationality or freedom , or given a little wordy sympathy to Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American republics , the world would have heard much less of the horrors of his policy . There are so many thrusts of this kind at Political opponents that one must find in them a salient characteristic of Salisbury 's literary style . On the whole , the most determined onslaught of the two volumes is the diatribe against Fox . Lord Salisbury , in casting about for reasons which will explain Pitt 's long retention of power , finds the most important of all in the low character of his opponents . " There have been many statesmen with worse characters than Fox ; there may have been some as pure as Pitt . But the extremes have never been contrasted with each other as they were in that generation . There never was a time when the reputation of one rival stood so high , while that of the other stood so low . " The political canonization of Fox is , in Lord Salisbury 's eyes , to be equalled only by the hagiological masterpieces of the Ada Sanetorum . " The intrigues of a restless ambition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been converted into the struggle of a second Hampden against a Court conspiracy for enslaving England . The phrases struck out in the heat of debate , or selected at random as the readiest missiles to fling at an adversary 's head , have been cited as the profound maxims of a political philosopher . " Lord Salisbury is willing to admit the fact of Fox 's wonderful fascination , but , in praising Pitt , he uses his strongest colors to bring out the contrast between purity of conduct and gross irregularity , between the noblest patriotism and the self-seeking littleness of party politics . Salisbury learned to be a hard hitter before ever he entered a ministry . Of the two studies in biography , that on Castlereagh is likely to prove the more interesting and valuable . Concerning Pitt , nothing is said which has not often been said before by his fervent admirers . Castlereagh , from having had few intimate friends and no picturesque qualities , becomes in most historical works a mere lay figure without flesh-and-blood associations of any kind . Lord Salisbury , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real service to his reputation by dwelling upon his deep sense of public duty , and interpreting his policy with sympathetic touch . For the rest , this collection of articles from the Quarterly is remarkable chiefly for its attack upon German policy in the Schleswig-Holstein affair and its somewhat unusual attitude toward the Polish question . Bismarck , who was not good at forgiving old enemies unless they had come to their knees , never liked Salisbury , and even fastened upon him a highly uncomplimentary phrase . Why the Chancellor cared so little for the colleague who accompanied Disraeli to the Berlin Congress may perhaps be seen from a perusal of Salisbury 's essay on the Danish Duchies . This criticism of Lord John 's refusal to draw the sword was doubtless a party pamphlet , but it was something more . It would easily have been possible to castigate the Whigs without writing thus : " The care with which the Germans have selected the weakest State upon their frontier for the exhibition of their irrepressible patriotism , shows of what metal it is made . The magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appeal to the German honor , would be in place if they were undertaking to free Alsace from France , or Livonia from Russia . Their zeal for German nationality , if it appears to us hot , is at least invariably safe . Once convince them that the raid on Denmark is not safe , and the excitement will subside with a marvellous rapidity . " Gibes of this kind do not make for the harmony of States or the good will of individual politicians , even in days when the immediate crisis is past . The article on " Poland " seems to us by far the most striking of the whole series , for in it Salisbury attempted a very unusual feat . With talk about the " crime " of partitioning Poland he had no patience whatever , but he did find ground to censure in the strongest terms the misgovernment of Poland by the Russians ; 1815 and not 1773 is for him the critical date in Polish annals . " As a nation the Poles had fallen by the justest retribution that was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an oppressive and barbarous domestic rule . But they had not lost their rights as men . They had a right to good government , and , at least , to some portion of the freedom they had lost . " In other words , Salisbury found an opportunity for denouncing Russia without uttering a syllable in praise of the ancient Polish polity which had perished during the period of the Partition treaties . The least sentimental of all men and a lover of paradox , this method of approaching the Polish question must have given him distinct intellectual amusement . Regarded merely as historical studies , the contributions which Lord Salisbury made to the Quarterly Review are not im portant . They attest a considerable range of reading in political history , but most of the facts employed seem to have been swept together for the occasion , while the spirit of the true historian is abundantly wanting . Thanks , however , to their trenchant style and their author 's subsequent part in foreign politics , they are worth reprinting.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
