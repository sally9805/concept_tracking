txt A Tour by the Tammany Candidate in Which He Defies His Managers and Grieves His Friends . James W. Osborne , Tammany candidate for District Attorney , went on another speech-making tour last night , and In the course of it again alarmed the friends who had begun to dread the result of his participation in the campaign . Mr. Osborne 's tour began at Cooper Union , where he spoke after the Mayor . He received a rousing welcome , the cheering lasting for more than a minute . When he began his address here he said he would only speak for a few minutes because he had other meetings to attend , but he spoke for an hour , his campaign managers vainly begging him to stop and go to the other meetings . " I 've got a lot to say . " Mr. Osborne replied to them . " and I 'm going to say it now that I 'm here . " " A vote for Mr. McClellan in this campaign , " he began , - is more important than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor represents all the self-restraint and conservatism that is left in New York at this time . " Then 14 asked categorically what had become of promises which he quoted as having been made by Mr. Jerome in 1901 . As he asked at the end of each , " Did he make good ? " there came hack a chorus of " No . " " Now , one of the things he said was that as soon as he was made District Attorney he would find out where Devery got it and that he 'd take the people into his confidence . He did n't keep his promise to send Devery away or tell where he got it any more than he kept any other Promise . But there was a wardman for Devery who was convicted and the man who convicted him was James W. Osborne . " I have tried to get Jerometo meet . me in a public debate " tad to thresh out these questions at issue between us , but I ca n't nail him . He has dodged every effort I have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I charge Jerome with having discriminated between the criminal rich and the criminal poor ; and I say now to you that if he had not made this discrimination James W. Osborne would not have been a candidate against him . " In his Carnegie Hall speech , Jerome said he was the ' floorwalker in political life . ' If I had hunted for years I could n't have.got.a term that fitted so well . The floorwalker who struts and stalks about *here-to . Enid this and that . Everybody works ' but the floor-Z ? Wallies . He 's the best-looking and the most incompetent man on the premises ? ' From time to time Mr. Osborne turned to his managers and asked them if he should stop .. They invariably said " Yes . " Mr. Osborne would then turn to his friends and declare that he would not stop , no matter what they wanted him to do . Invariably he got a cheer for his decision . When he closed at last , he started out to keep his engagements at Sulzer 's Harlem River Casino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , in the Bronx . Under the excitement of the fast automobile trip on the way to Harlem , the suddenly decided not to visit Sulzer 's Casino at all , and passed on to the Bronx . An accident to the automobile caused an annoying halt , and it was after 11 o'clock when the party reached Zeitner 's at 110th Street and Third Avenue . After a brief sojourn in the Bronx the candidate deceded that perhaps it would be better after all to visit Suzer 's Casino . He arrived there at 11:45 o'clock , and found that of the large crowd that had gathered earlier in the evening only 200 or 300 persons remained . Mr. Osborne made a speech , however . He devoted the greater part of half an hour there to abusing Mr. Jerome , Among other things he said : " I am not particularly anxious to be elected District Attorney except for one thing , and that is to beat that miserable fakir , William Travers Jerome . " " Why , my own mother , God bless her ! said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and I told her that I did not care except that I wanted to beat Je-rome ? " Now . I want you people to go out and be missionaries for me . I want you to talk to your neighbors , catch them by wring their necks , pour cold water over them , but , above all things , be sure and tell them all the things I have told you about Jerome . " Mr. Osborne then drew a word picture of the horrors of the Slocum disaster ; lamented the fate of the late Saltri Parks , and talked about Wisker , the engineer in charge of the train which was wracked in the New York Central tunnel , Some of Mr. Osborne 's auditors sobbed when he ' told them that the criminal rich had escaped prosecution and that the criminal poor were not only prosecuted , but per-1 wonted . Mr. Osborne was still speaking to a ham:Ifni of listeners at an early hour this morning .                 @ @ @ @
