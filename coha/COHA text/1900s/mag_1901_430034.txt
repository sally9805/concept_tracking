 | IN one of the valleys of New England there is a village of possibly two hundred people with the fortunes of which I have been intimately acquainted for nearly half a century . My ancestors were among the very first to settle in that part of the State , and that township ; and my family has been closely connected with the community for nearly a century and a half . My nearest living relatives , outside my own personal family , still reside in this village ; and I know , and for forty years I have known , nearly every person in the community by face and by name , although it is thirty years since my own home has been elsewhere . On a recent visit to this rural spot , it occurred to me to walk the entire length of the village street , noting familiar landmarks and the changes which have taken place in the occupancy of the various residences , and recalling these as I first knew them nearly a half-century ago . The results of that morning 's walk are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and conditions . At the farther end of the village stands what now remains of a story-and-a-half cottage . In the earlier days , its roof covered a family of six daughters and one son . They were of New England parentage , the blood of the purest strain . One of these daughters went South , became a teacher of note and a woman of extraordinary influence , and is represented to-day by her son ? a brilliant graduate of West Point and an army officer of high standing and clean record . A sister followed her outgoing , and , marrying in Pennsylvania , was the mother of a family of unusual attainments , her eldest son being to-day the general manager of one of the great railroad corporations in this country . To another daughter were born two daughters , one of whom was the manager and promoter of the first great department store of Boston ; and the other is still a teacher of wide reputation , whose pupils enter Princeton with the best possible preparation in the studies in which she has been their instructor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the leading business men of the State , always connected with large interests , and always engaged in energetic effort to develop the best resources of the commonwealth . The other children died in early youth . This old home is now a poultry-house , and the old flower garden and kitchen garden are part of the poultry-yard . As owners and occupants of the next house , I remember a New England bachelor with his maiden sister . They were people of unusual intelligence , very influential in church and civic and social affairs , generous and large-hearted , living helpful lives . The brother died first , leaving his property to his sister ; and the sister gave most that she possessed for the endowment of the village church . This house has been modernized , and is occupied by a young American and his wife , ? no children , ? who owns and controls the mill and wood-working shops on the river near by . Next , on the left , stands one of the oldest houses in the village and one of the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I first came to the village , it was occupied by a gentleman and his wife , with three children , bearing a family name then favorably and widely known . The father recently died in the insane asylum of the State ; the mother is certainly on her way there , even if it would not be a kindness to place her there at once . Two of the children died in early youth ; and the third led a wild , lawless , reckless life , and is rarely seen about the old town . The house is closed and deserted . Across the river , and beyond the mill to which reference was just made , stands the home of another of this last family ? a cousin . I remember him as a genial , quick-witted , shrewd philosopher , ? a typical New Englander in every respect , ? wise even beyond his times , and helpful in many ways . His wife , though more quiet , was his full equal . Two sons are still living , and are leading business men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This house is now occupied by an Irishman and his family . They can read and write ? possibly ? and are industrious people , and , , good enough " citizens ? in their way . The mill fairly holds its own in work and in reputation , though for long years this property lay dormant , if not idle . It has recently revived , however , and may become as important a factor in the life of the community as it once was . But the mill hands are nearly all foreigners ; I think there are but two native-born . Walking eastward , again on the main street , one reaches a somewhat modern cottage , built on the site of a house which I well remember , and which now serves as an ice-house . Out from under the old roof more than one representative  | has gone forth to do credit to the family name , and to render good service to the country at large . One became an assistant secretary of the treasury of the United States , most successfully negotiated some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in a Western city is proving himself a financier of high standing . This property is now occupied by an Irishman , the foreman of the local railway section ; no children . Across the way stands an old residence , with a colonial porch and doorway , still sound and even inviting . Fifty years ago , this was the residence of a family each one of which was of more than ordinary ability and won more than ordinary success . One went to California in the early days and became one of the leading attorneys of that State , having much to do with laving the foundations of its constitutional and statutory law . This house now shelters the family of a day-laborer who works on the railway section over which his neighbor opposite is the , , boss . " When 1 first knew the next building , on the left , it was occupied by a young New England couple , the husband then working in the old mill . Since that time , tired of the narrowness of the village life and fretting under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed to a Western State , where both father and ( now ) sons and sons-in-law are important , influential men . This house , now in a dilapidated condition , is occupied by an Irish family . The next dwelling is still quite imposing . It is two full stories , with an unusually large halfstory above , and the ground plan is ample in the extreme . It is in good repair , and there is even an air of prosperity about it . A leading physician and surgeon of a Western State comes back occasionally to look at this as his mother 's old home . One of the merchant princes of the metropolis brings his wife here at times to recall the days of her childhood . And an influential member of the Legislature of New York counts these as brother and sister . The property is at present occupied by those of New England stock ; but I hesitate to chronicle the change that has taken place in the quality of the strain . It is enough to say that there is no possible prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was for the old . Just beyond , on the right , is the old home of a man who perhaps made as deep and lasting an impression upon the State and upon its fortunes as any other one man in all its history . This house is occupied to-day by the wife of the last of his kin ? herself on the verge of insanity , living alone , a most pitiful object , exciting both the anxiety and the sympathy of the neighborhood . On the left , again , is a small story-and-a-half cottage the history of which and of its people know all too well . One son went into the West , where he is now high in official position on one of the great railways , holding the confidence of the entire corporation . A grandson , a university man and specially prepared for his work , is a draughtsman and designer in one of the great shipyards of this country . The second son is an expert workman and successful building contractor . This house is now occupied by a feeble girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of softening of the brain and a younger son ? a grandson of the old stock ? has just been placed in the State insane asylum . In the midst of a beautiful lawn , sheltered by magnificent trees , stands one of the most attractive cottages in the village . The owner , in an earlier day , was the senior warden of the parish a large-brained , earnest , thoughtful , generous man . He died some years ago . His wife survived him but a few months . Their only child is an honest , upright , unsuccessful , helpless sort of fellow , largely dependent upon his wife 's exertions for his own maintenance . This house is closed , except as it is rented during the summer to people from an adjoining city . The next house tells the same story of a large family , now scattered to the four winds ; the residence unoccupied , except during the three summer months . At the next corner , near what the villagers still call " the fork of the roads , " is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family . The squire was one of those rare men who only lack opportunity to be truly great and renowned . He was the patron saint of the village , ? thought not much of a saint after all , ? the trusted counselor of all who needed advice , the one man of large financial resources , and the one man of the community who was undertaking various enterprises on a somewhat large scale . Had he lived in the days of the telegraph and the telephone and of electricity , he would have been a capitalist of success and power , and in all probability a statesman of note and influence . None of this family now remains except the aged widow of one of the sons and the widow of a grandson , who occasionally comes up from the city for a short stay during the summer . In place of the old squire and his family is the young widow of a member of one of the lesser families of the village , who maintains herself and her daughters by opening this house during the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands one of the largest and finest residences ? again deserted ; except during the summer months .  |p464  On the right , next to the old-time graveyard , is the village church . I well remember when both floor and galleries were always at least reasonably well filled , and sometimes were crowded . Possibly thirty or thirty-five people gather there for worship , from Sunday to Sunday , at present . Of the one leading family to which reference has already been made , there was a time when thirteen distinct households were represented in these pews . Now there are just two persons of this name who are known upon the parish rolls . Opposite the church stands the one-time residence of a distinguished lawyer . In later years it has been owned and occupied by a family the members of which have acquired no mean distinction . One of the sons was for years the manager of a water-transportation company , with his office in one of our largest cities . Another , for thirty years held a most prominent place in the pulpit of a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a quarter of a century at least a third dictated the policies of his State , making and unmaking men of national reputation , and more than once touching very closely and decisively great national movements . One grandson is at present a distinguished member of the faculty of one of the largest Western universities . Another grandson has made an enviable reputation in the educational world and in civil life . The sole occupants of this house to-day are two women : one of them past seventy , and the other in middle life , lovingly and unselfishly caring for the latter days of her next of kin . I remember when the old town hall , adjoining this property , was built . It became at once the center of the common life of the village . On the ground floor was located the village library , the doors of which have been closed for at least twenty years . In the large hall above were given , winter after winter , lectures by some of the best talent of this country . Now , the Young Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional exhibition of amateur theatricals ; or a wandering " Uncle Tom 's " show , with its hounds and Topsies , delights the villagers . In the front room of the ground floor , which was once the office of the town clerk and of the justice of the peace , stands a heavy steel cage under the care of the sheriff of the county , who is also a resident of the town , ? itself both a , symptom and a disease . The house opposite the little old country inn , once filled to overflowing with children , is now vacant and deserted except during a few summer months . Passing beyond " the tavern , " there still stands a house , the roof of which once covered a family of more than usual note . One of the sons became a civil engineer , and rose to the very top of his profession . Another removed to a Western State , where he climbed rapidly upward in the practice of the law to a most enviable position in its judiciary . A grandson of unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in the lower house of Congress . This property is now owned by an Irish Catholic and occupied by the families of Irish ( la v-lal corers . On the corner beyond is the old-time residence of one of the leading attorneys of the State , whose word was law before nearly every judiciary of his day , and whose integrity was as unquestioned as his influence was widespread and wholesome . His son became attorney-general of one of the leading Western States , and recently died in full possession of both reputation and power . Not a trace of this family remains . The house is occupied by one who at the expiration of twenty years ' residence is still regarded as an alien and a foreigner , ? the keeper of a small store in the village . Still farther on stands the house out of which went an editor of one of the most influential papers of Connecticut . This property is closed and abandoned . On the right live two maiden sisters , both past middle life , and an old and decrepit aunt , sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother of which has the honor of having conceived and projected the plans for the first bridge across the Mississippi River . Next to them lives the village physician , a worthy man of middle age , but not to he mentioned in the same breath with his predecessor , one of the most ingenious and successful practitioners of his day , combining rare surgical skill with remarkable powers of diagnosis and prescription . In the old frame building just beyond were held all the early town meetings , the first diocesan convention of the Episcopal Church , and many other notable gatherings of notable people . This is occupied by an Irish section-hand . Out of this village and parish and township have gone men and women who made large contributions to the welfare of the communities of which they became a part . If I did not hesitate to speak more plainly , fearing to make too easy the identification of this once favored spot , I could write of men who have been at the very fore of every profession and in every walk of life ; men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands , the law would have missed much of its higher interpretation and suc/ cessful enforcement , the ministry would have lost no little of its eloquence and administrative power , education would have been deprived of great uplifting forces , great business enterprises would have fallen short of their most successful management , the army would have lost some of its official luster , and the public service would not have known some of its brightest names . There are a few new houses and some new people , most of them temporary sojourners through only a portion of the year . The population of the village has not increased , and the population of the township has even decreased , during the last half-century . The village was bitterly Tory during the Revolution , being loyal to the Established Church ; was intensely Federal , after ; then as ardently Whig ; then Republican to the core . To-day , with a large Irish Catholic vote , the issue of an election is at least doubtful . I can recall the time when the New York Tribune ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the village post-office . Now the " yellow journals " hold the palm for circulation and influence . Then the village was connected with the outer world by stage line only ; now not less than ten passenger trains pass it every twenty-four hours , and the telegraph and long-distance telephone master time and space . Then there were no shops nor factories ; now it has both . Then there was not a barber shop nor a livery stable in the " street ; " now there are two stables and one barber shop . Then not a drop of intoxicating liquor was sold in the village ; now there is a bar at the tavern , doing a " good business . " Then there was an excellent public school , crowded with pupils , and a good private school besides ; now there is an inferior public school only , and that with a scanty attendance . This is a statement of conditions , not of conclusions ; of facts , not of theories . Each may draw his own inference , and read between the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read .
