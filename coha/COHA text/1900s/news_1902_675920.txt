txt An Enoch Arden returning with a son-inlaw is the rather unusual change rung on the old story of the poet Tennyson by a Newark man who last week returned to tha scene of his first domestic bliss after an absence of almost thirty years . James j Morrow never went to sea as did the origi ! , nal of the story , but spent the intervening years in various small towns of the middle West engaged in the somewhat prosaic occupation of making cheeses . He returned last week , not for the purpose of greeting again his first love , but to take steps for the recovery of a considerable fortune which has been awaiting him here for a number of years . The son-in-law who accompanied him back to the scenes of his youth is the husband of Enoch Arden Morrow 's daughter by a second wife . The strange case came Up yesterday before Justice Scott in the Supreme Court in an application to have , in effect , James Morrow , who last July was legally declared dead by Justice Gildersleeve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicant in yesterday 's court proceedings , is the son of Mrs. Ann Morrow , the sister of William , the old baseball player and concert hall keeper who in the early seventies amassed a large fortune as the owner of the old Haymarket at Sixth Avenue and Thirtieth Street . Old man died in 151 ) 9 , and by the terms of his will a large part of the estate , valued then at upward of $4011,000 , was left to the Issue of his several brothers and sisters . All of the latter had been dead for years . Tile most interesting of all the heirs to the estate was James Morrow . His mother was Mrs. . Ann Morrow , the daughter of , and he was born in this city in 1849 . That part of his life 's history of most immediate interest is his marriage in February , 151 ' 2 , in Newark . to a young woman who was employed with him in Clark 's thread mills . In November of the same year the young man bade his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , Ill. , where he hoped to ' make a home and later send for her . In May , 1573 , a son was born in the Newark home , and still the absent husband had not completed arrangements for them to come to the Western home . The husband and wife continued to exchange affectionate letters for nearly two years . when the letter- ; from Morrow to his wife ceased . In the early part of 1876 she received a letter from Orange , Tex. , signed with her husband 's name , in which he said that he had been shot in a saloon row in the town and was then in a hospital , which he never ex- ' petted to leave alive . He begged his wife 's forgiveness for any neglect that he might hav:i been guilty of and bade her good-bye forever . A little later one William Finley of Newark received a letter from a friend from Orange , Tex. , stating that James Morrow had died in the hospital there from wounds received in a barroom fight . The widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to take an interest in ? life , and when James Smith , a Newark man , asked leave to take the place of her first love , she consented . As she had no absolute proof of her first husband 's death . ' however , she applied for a divorce in the New Jersey courts on the ground of aban donment . The divorce was duly granted and the widow become Mrs. Mary Smith . Her son , young Samuel H. Morrow , grew to manhood and became a musician , and after the death of his grandfather . Will- ? lam , In 1890 , he applied , through his lawyers , for his share in the estate as the direct heir of the missing and supposed long dead father , James Morrow . All this evidence was presented last June before Justice Gildersleeve , in the Supreme Court , and on July 2 , the Justice , after re , viewing the case , declared in effect that James Morrow was dead , and young Samuel Morrow prepared to enjoy the substantial fortune which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate . The executors of the estate had for years been advertising in the papers throughout the - United States on the supposition that James Morrow might be alive . Three weeks ago Lawyer Claire , attorney for the executors , received a letter from him saying that the writer was alive and well , and for the past thirty years had resided within a radius of forty miles from New Lebanon , the town in which long ago he had gone to prepare a home for his young wife . The case was put in the hands of Lawyer John S. of 24G Broadway , and ten days ago there walked into the office of Mr. a man clad in a rough overcoat , top boots , and a bearskin cap , who said he was James Morrow , and he was armed with affidavits , &c.,; which are said to establish his story as true beyond a doubt . He was accompanied by a young man about twenty-two years old , whom he introduced as his son-in-law , and then he told his strange story . which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application to have the case reopened . It appears that after he went West he lived in a dozen or more small towns in Indiana , Illinois , and Wisconsin , and in 1580 , after hearing a vague rumor that his wife had obtained a divorce from him , married a Western girl , and has five children , the oldest of whom , a daughter , is married . Morrow told his lawyer here that a few weeks ago he took a notion to visit New Lebanon . and there was told of an advertisement in an old paper for one James Morrow , for whom a legacy was waiting . He concluded to come East and see about it , and brought his son-in-law along with him for company . He said that he had never been in Texas . and can not account , for the letters received by his first wifa ' and Finley . Morrow only staid two days in the city last week , and said he did not have any excuse for deserting his wife . He said he would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not strong enough to induce him to journey to Newark . Mrs. Smith . the first wife , is said to have a large family by her second husband . The amount of the estate coming to James Morrow is placed by Lawyer W. H. Osborne , counsel for young Samuel Morrow , at 580 , - 000 . Lawyer , the long lost father 's counsel . place : it at $15,000 . Justice Scott advised yesterday that the case be brought before Justice Gildersleeve , and that Justice will undoubtedly appoint a referee before whom eventually James Morrow will have to meet his wife of long ago .
