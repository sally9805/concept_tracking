txt Two neatly dressed , ruddy faced , athletic looking young men , grinning broadly ; one a giant in contrast to the squattiness of the other , walked along the veranda of the clubhouse at the Polo Grounds about 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon . Below them was a sea of 10,000 faces , wildly emitting a thundrous eruption of enthusiasm . The two young men looked down upon the reverberating ocean of humanity for a moment , and then wetted to a point directly in front of the plaza , where they were in view of all . The ten thousand throats bellowed forth a tribute that would have almost drowned a broadside of twelve-inch guns . The two smiling athletes stopped , one of them drew forth a long sheet of yellow paper rolled under his arm . As the crowd pushed and fought and cheered he unwrapped an impromptu banner and let it flutter on the breeze . The multitude pressed forward like a wave to read this inscription : THE GLA.NTS , WORLD 'S CHAMPIONS , 1005 . Geological records show that Vesuvius disturbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater number . But if that doctrine had been promulgated in the vicinity of the Polo Grounds yesterday , as Christie Mathewson and Roger Bresnahan of the New York Baseball Club unfurled their victorious banner , it would have been minimized . For , as volcanoes assert themselves upon the earth 's surface surely must that deafening , reverberating roar have lifted Manhattan 's soil from its base . The Giants , the most Intelligent , the quickest , strongest , and grittiest combination of baseball players that have ever represented this city in any league . demonstrated beyond opportunity for quibble or claim their paramount superiority over anything extant in diamond life of today by winning the fourth and deciding game of the National Championship series . The victory meant an honor which has not hitherto fallen to the lot of New York through any other team , and by the victory of yesterday the Giants may hold up their heads in the athletic world as being the one collection of peerless ball tossers . The crowd , in the neighborhood of 27,000 people , saw the battle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and satisfy the innermost cravings of the rooter 's mind . It was a fight of slow stages , but at no time during the contest were the Giants in danger , and at all times were they masters . It settled the Question so often propounded whet her the National or the American League offers the better brand of baseball . The championship decree of yesterday , to be accepted as final , lays at rest all doubt and demonstrates the transcendent superiority of the National brand arid the indisputable invulnerability of the Giants . And be It recorded right here that New York possesses the pitching marvel of the century. ? Christie Mathewson. the giant slahman. who made the world 's championship possible for New York , may be legitimately designated as the premier pitching wonder of all baseball records . The diamond has known its Clarkson. its Keefe , and its Caruthers . Their records radiate . Rut to Mathewson belongs the palm , for his almost superhuman accomplishment during the series which closed yesterday will stand as a mark for all pitchers of the future . Mathewson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished . In the three victories over which he presided he twirled twentyseven innings . During that series he allowed not a single run ; not an Athletic even reached third base . He was touched for only a total of fifteen hits , and by men who are reckoned as the American League 's strongest batters : he allowed only one pass to first , hit only a single batsman . and struck out sixteen men . The record is a classic . Baseball New York appreciates this work . That fact was amply demonstrated yesterday , when it gave Mathewson a marvelous vocal panegyric and placed upon his modest brow a bellowed wreath that evoked only a half-suppressed smile and bow . The game yesterday was one of giants ? clean . fast , and decisive . Both teams were keyed to the point of desperation . for to the Giants it meant rosy conquest and to the Athletics a saving clause which would offer them yet a chance to redeem themselvts . But the Giants were not to be repulsed . They went at the ball in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was not a minute durina-play in which that spirit did n't manifest itself . Philadcltiliia tried its best , but . strive as hard as it did . it was only a shadow reflecting the masterful Mathew-son 's will . He bestrode the field like a mighty Colossus . and the Athletics peeped about the diamond like pigmies who struggled gallantly for their lives , but in vain . Bender. the much feared brave from the Carlisle reservation , sought to repeat his scalping bee of Tuesday . but the Spartan McGraw laconically expressed the situa-tion when at the beginning of the game he remarked good-naturedly to the Atli-letics ' pitcher : " It will be off the warpath for you to-day , Chief . " The stolid . phrlegfiiatle copper-colored man only smiled grimly . " It 's uncertain , " he replied , " but I did it once . and I 'm going to do my best to do it again . " deleted 2 paragraphs Browne was equal to the occasion and put one exaetly'where Roger had sent it . Donlin walked to the plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry , old Pitch-Ern-Heap , " he remarked to Bender jokingly , " but here 's where you go back to the reservation . " " Is that so ? " answered Bender sarcastically . " Your conclusion , Mr. Donlin , is right in this immediate vicinity . " Donlin went out to Lord , and McGann , who followed , cut off three slices of air , and walked away a heart-broken man . When che game ended the crowd broke through the ' police and rushed for the players . The Giants were quick , how , ever , and got into the clubhouse before being intercepted . Ten thousand fans surrounded the clubhouse and demanded to see their heroes . One by one the Giants appeared and were cheered . McGraw made a brief speech , in which he said : deleted 2 paragraphs First base on errors  --  Philadelphia , 1 . Bases on balls  --  Off Bender , 3 .

Hartsel , the first batsman for the Athletics in the first inning , gave the sup-1 porters of the American League champions a little encouragement by reaching first on a hit that Dahlencame very near gathering on the fly . He stopped the ball with outstretched hand , but was unable to hold it . Lord tried bunting , but was not successful , his little fly being captured by Bresnahan in front of the plate . Davis forced ; Hartsel out at second , Devlin to Dahlen. and Davis had only a trifle to spare from being doubled up . The inning after this soon came to an end , as the best Lave Cross could do was to be thrown out at first by Gilbert . For the New Yorks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called strikes , but the third one he hit smartly to M. Cross , who was compelled to throw the ball fast to catch the runner at first . Browne hit to short , and although the ball was thrown well , the right fielder almost beat it to the base . Donlin 's effort was a little hit in front of the plate , which proved troublesome for Bender to throw . He made a good attempt , however , and Davis reached out and caught the ball with one hand . In the second inning Seybold sent the first ball pitched to left field for a base . Murphy put an easy grounder into Dahlen 's hands close to second , and by a quick toss to Gilbert , and he to McGann , a sharp double play was the result . Monte Cross hit a slow ball to third base , which Devlin was totally unable to gather in time to do any execution . Cross made an attempt to steal second , but he was easily stopped by Bresnahan 's pretty throw to Gilbert . The inning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive . McGann began by being called out on the third strike . Mertes hit well to left field , but his aspirations were checked when he tried to steal second . Dahlen failed to connect with Bender 's drops . and when called out on strikes , objected to Umpire Sheridan 's rulings . Powers got to first base in the third Inning on a tantalizing hit , which Mathewson was compelled to run up to , but failed to gather . The ex-Bucknell University student , however , got him at second on Bender 's hit . Hartsel forced the Indian out at second , Devlin to Gilbert . Hartsel got no further than first , as Lord struck out . Devlin did not make a very good beginning for the Giants , putting up a foul fly which Powers caught without difficulty . ' Gilbert was more fortunate , a neat single to centre field being the result of his efforts . He landed on second on Mathewson 's sacrifice , but was left there when Bresnahan was caught out by Hartsel . Only three men on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the Athletics . Davis was easily thrown out at first by Gilbert , " Lave " Cross struck out , and Devlin had an easy task in taking Seybold 's fly . For the New Yorks . Browne hit out the first ball pitched , which Hartsel took care of , and then Donlin and McGann were victims of Bender and Davis . In the fifth inning , after Murphy had been thrown out at first by Dahlen , and M. Cross had been retired on a fly by Davis , Powers hit over the heads of the spectators in left field , which netted him two bases . In his anxiety to advance a base , however , he attempted to get to third on Bender 's hit to Devlin and was easily run down by Devlin . The fifth was a lucky inning for New York , and Bender was wild in his delivery . The first four balls pitched to Mertes gave the batsman a base . The Indian did not become any steadier when Dahlen faced him , and he , too , reached first on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devlin 's sacrifice hit to L. Cross , who threw out Devlin at first , Bender pitched only two balls to Gilbert when he hit out a fly to Hartsel , and , Mertes made a dash for home and Dahlen for third . The former tallied , but Cross gathered Hartsel 's throw in time to catch Dahlen at third , which ended the inning . There were four men who went to the bat for the Athletics in the sixth inning , Three reached first , but no runs were scored . Hartsel was safe on a weak hit to Mathewson , but was quickly forced out on Lord 's hit , Gilbert to Dahlen . Lord was finally caught taking too much ground off first by a splendid throw of Bresnahan 's . Davis hit safely to left field , and this proved to be the last base hit the Athletics could get . L. Cross ended the inning by being thrown out by Devlin . Mathewson hit the first ball pitched to centre field , which Lord captured after a good run . Bresnahan reached first on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Bender picked it up . Browne followed with another bunt in the same direction . Donlin went out on a fly to centre . McGann struck out . In the next three innings only nine of the Atetics went to the bat and onl one manhl hit to the outfield , and that was Powers , whose fly was easily caught by Mertes . In the New York 's seventh Mertes , Dahlen , and Devlin went out in succession , but in the eighth the local men scored their second run chiefly through another base on balls . With Gilbert out , Mathewson had four bad balls Continued from Page 1 . while the Athletics rang up for a total of six against Mathewson . Mathewson fanned only three to Bender 's five , but the Indian gave three passes . Mathewson proved a surprise to his admirers ov poorly fielding his position . He made two errors , but they luckily resulted in nothing harmful in the net result . Giants Get $1,141 Each . The Giants were well rewarded for their hard work in defeating the Athletics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a check in his wallet for $1,141.41 . That is the share of each of the eighteen Giants for the series . The figures given out officially yesterday show the receipts of the first four games , from which the players derive their profit , to have been $30,730.5n . The share for which the two teams struggled amounted to $27,394 . Seventy-five per cent . of that amount was divided among the Giants . The remainder went in equal shares to the Athletics . The crowd which saw yesterday 's game was Immense , exceeding by a small margin that of Tuesday . All the stands were filled , while men and women stood in a line ten deep back of the ropes from the right to the left field bleachers . Men hung on the fence and sat on the grandstand roof , and some peered at the game through glasses from distant poles and housetops . The crowd was there to cheer its idols , and every move was followed by a roar . The New York management had a band on the field to enliven things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players walked to the field and started practice . As McGraw appeared on the diamond , coming from the clubhouse , he was met with a volley of applause and was obliged to lift his hat in response . " Clinch it to-day , Mac , yelled the crowd . " Nothing but the championship will suit us now . " " That 's what you 'll get , " he responded smilingly . While McGraw was walking across the field the Athletics appeared from the clubhouse with Bender in the lead . " Back to the tepee for yours , " hooted a rooter . " Giants grab heap much wampum , " yelled another , giving an imitation Indian yell . Bender looked at his foes in stolid silence , but smiled widely as the running fire of comments continued . James J. Corbett , with an eye for all public opportunities , walked into the field with the Giants and helped the players to warm up . He was subjected to a good deal of bantering . Just before play was called Corbett and Bresnahan posed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographer . Mathewson was the last to arrive on the scene and got a magnificent reception . He was applauded for a full minute and the crowd yelled for him to doff his cap . Instead of doing so , however , he walked over to McGinnity , the conqueror of yesterday , and ostentatiously removed Joe 's headgear . McGinnity returned the compliment . " Shake ' em up , Matty . Go after ' em , " screamed the bleachers . Mathewson waved his arm as though he would do his utmost . As McGraw went to the plate to bat out in practice the band began to play : We 'll all get stone blind . Johnnie go fill up the bowl The crowd cheered , and a half dozen men went through the grandstand offering to bet 10 ( 1 to 75 that the Giants would win the game . There were no takers . Could n't Rattle Bender . Time and again Bender was yelled at , for the crowd wanted to rattle him , but its noise might as well have been directed at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages . In one inning he gave two bases on balls in succession and the crowd Jumped to its feet in glee . Bender was thunderously informed that at that particular stage he was booked for the soap factory , but stuck grimly to his task . At another time two bunts were made in succession . Again the crowd rose in its might and expressed itself as of the opinion that the chief would surely go to the happy hunting grounds , but he refused to die and stood gamely and quietly to the end . Danny McGann was again a target for the Bender brand of curves , and added to his strike-out performance of Tuesday . when he slashed the air in a way that was distressing . The first time up yesterday McGann , with his strike-out record fresh in the minds of the fans , was cautioned to be wary and smash the ball to the earth 's ends . " Look out , Danny , the Heap-MuchKill-'em-Giants man 'll get you . Lace it out of the lot . " McGann 's face bespoke ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chagrin of the rooters , he was called out on strikes . As McGann walked toward the home bench the crowd raised a hiss of protest at Sheridan . McGraw , Dahlen , Bresnahan. and Clark had heart-to-heart talks with the indicator , but they were shooed away . As the game proceeded the crowd saw that it was to be a magnificent pitching ' struggle , and both twirlers were cheered . After the fourth , when Bender had acquitted himself by retiring the Giants in one , two , three order , he was heartily applauded . You 're the real thing ; kangaroo out of the American and come to us next season . " howled one fan . Bender lifted his cap in acknowledgment . Philadelphia had men on bases in the first , second , third , fifth , and sixth innings . but could n't get one past the second sack . In the fifth inning they came close to pushing a man to third , but Mathewson , evidently intent upon keeping his record intact , interfered , Powers had made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . lined one to Mathewson . There were two out , and by the ordinary rules of baseball the batter should have been retired . Powers started off for third , however , and Mathewson , seeing him approaching the bag , took the insult to heart . He threw quickly to Devlin . who touched the runner before he could put his spikes upon the bag . New - York made its runs in the fifth and eighth . In the fifth inning Mertes got a pass and Dahlen followed suit by passing four bad ones . With two on bases the crowd , keen for an opportunity to root , stood up and roared for Devlin to drive in a run . " Show ' em the way to the clubhouse . Arthur , " shouted Clark . who stood upon the coaching line . Devlin . however , had his orders and bunted . He sacrificed the runners to third and second , respectively and as the men chased down the line the crowd nearly yelled itself hoarse . Besieged by the Rooters . " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands . Then came a volley of taunts to Bender , who viewed the situation with absolute imperturbability and wound up his pitching arm'for New York 's second baseman . But Gilbert was equal to the occasion . for he caught one of Bender 's twists on the end of his bat and sent the sphere to deep left . Hartzel got under the base and caught it , but Mertes on third raced home with the first tally of the game . Then the crowd went wild and cheered everything and everybody . In the eighth the Giants rolled up another . After Gilbert had flied to Lord , Mathewson went to the bat amid a storm of yells . He passed four bad ones , and walked . Bresnahan put an extra coat of dust upon his hands as he stalked to the plate and carefully inspected the business end of his bat . The crowd yelled for him to " Swat it off the earth ! " " Put it in a balloon , Roger , and send it away for good : " screamed the fans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a straight line to the left field bleachers . Ordinarily it would have counted for a home run , but under the ground rules he was allowed only two , ' bases . Even Matty was enamored of the coup , for as he trotted around to third he paused , under the ground rule allowance , and clapped his hands with satisfaction . Browne , the next up , did his best to Imitate Bresnahan , and swung I viciously at one of Bender 's curves . It went like a shot straight for the Indian . Bender grabbed at the leather , and it struck his right hand , caroming off to Murphy , who retired Browne . Matty , however , jumped across the rubber and registered a second tally . The Giants also came within an ace of scoring in the sixth . Mathewson went out to Lord on a high fly . to be followed by Bresnahan , who bunted safely along .
