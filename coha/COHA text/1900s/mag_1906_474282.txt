IN a circular hollow in the clear , bright gravel of the river her the tiny egg of the great Quah Davie salmon stirred to life . For months it had lain there among its thousands of fellows , with the clear , cold , unsullied current streaming over it ceaselessly . The bar on which the parent salmon had hollowed their round gravel nest was far up the Great South Branch of the Quah Davie , not many miles from the little , cold spring lake that was its source . The Great South Branch was a stream much loved by the salmon , for its deep pools , its fine gravel spawningbeds , the purity and steady coldness of its current , and the remoteness which protected it from the visits of greedy poachers . In all its course there was but one serious obstruction , namely , the Big Falls , where the stream fell about twelve feet in one pitch , then roared down for half a mile over a succession of low ledges with deep pools between . The falls were such that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they inexorably weeded out the weaklings . No feeble salmon ever got to the top of that straight and thunderous pitch . Therefore , as the spawningbars were all above the fails , it was a fine , long-finned , clean-swimming breed of salmon that was bred in the Great South Branch . When the tiny egg in the gravel stirred to life ? as the thousand other tiny eggs were doing at the same time , ? there was no ice sheet imprisoning the current , which ran , singing pleasantly , under a soft spring sun . The deep hollow in the gravel sheltered the moving atoms , so that they were not swept away by the current streaming over them . But minute as they were , they speedily gathered a strength altogether miraculous for their size , as they absorbed the clinging sacs Vol , . OXII. ? No. 669. - 52 of egg substance and assumed the forms of fish , almost microscopic , but perfect . This advance achieved , they began to venture from behind and beneath the sheltering pebbles , to dare the urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters , where the perils which beset young salmon would be fewer and less insistent . The egg from which he came having been one of the first to hatch , the tiny salmon was one of the first of the host to find his strength and to start the migration shoreward from the nest on the noisy bar . Perhaps a score started with him , trying the current , darting back to shelter , then more boldly venturing again . A passing trout , hungry and fierceeyed , darted above them , heading up against the stream ; but being so few and scattered they escaped his fatal attentions . Terrified , however , by the sudden shadow , they hid in the gravel , and for some time made no further trial of the dangerous outer world . When the salmon atom ventured forth again he found himself in a greater company . Hundreds more of the tiny creatures had left the nest and were moving shoreward with him . As the defenceless throng advanced , he saw a couple of what seemed to him gigantic creatures dashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by twos and threes ; and he himself barely escaped those greedy jaws by shooting forward in the nick of time . These seeming monsters were but young redfins , a couple of inches in length , whom he would soon come to despise and chase from his feeding-grounds . His superior development and speed having so well served him , he was now a foot or more in advance of the throng , and so escaped another and even more wide-ranging peril . A huge shadow , as vast as that of the trout , swept down upon them ; and as he shrank beneath a sharp-edged stone he saw a big sucker settle lazily down where the thronging fry were thickest . With round , horribly dilating and contracting mouth , turned down like an inverted snout , the big fish sucked up the little wrigglers greedily , even drawing them out by his power of suction from their hidings in the gravel . Of the hundreds that had started on the first migration from the nest , not more than threescore followed their frightened and panting mite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Among the little stones close to shore , where the water was hardly more than an inch deep , even the greedy young redfins would not venture . Nevertheless there were plenty of enemies waiting eagerly for the coming of the newhatched fry , and the little fellow whose one hour of seniority had made him the pioneer of the shoal found all his ability taxed to guard the speck of life which he had so lately achieved . Keeping far enough from shore to avoid being stranded by some whimsical ripple , he nevertheless avoided the depths that were sufficient for the free hunting of the predatory minnows and redfins . Such of his kinsfolk as stayed farther out soon served , the greater number of them , as food for the larger river-dwellers , while those who went too close inshore got cast up on the sand to die , or were pounced upon , as they lay close to the surface , by ravenous and unerring mosquitoes , which managed to pierce them even through a film of water a sixteenth of an inch or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen depth , however , the little pioneer had plenty of perils to guard against . Secure from the suckers and redfins on one hand , and the mosquitoes on the other , he had yet for enemies certain predatory larvae and water-beetles , as well as a few inch-long youngsters of the trout family , who were very active and rapacious . There was a water-beetle with booked , pincerlike jaws and lightning rapidity of movement , which kept him almost ceaselessly on the alert , and filled him with wholesome terror as he saw it capture and devour numbers of his less nimble or less wary kin . And one day , when he had chanced , in the company of his diminished school of fry , to drift into a shallow cove where there was no current at all to disturb the water , he was chased by the terrible larva of a dragon-fly . This strange-looking creature , with what seemed a blank , featureless mask where its face and jaws ought to be , darted at him under the propulsion of jets of water sucked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time , he made good his escape between the stalks of a fine water-weed where the big larva could not penetrate . Meanwhile , as he was himself continually busy catching and devouring the tiny forms of life which abounded in those fruitful waters ? minute shellfish and the spawn of the water-snails that clung under the stones , gnats , and other small insects that feed on the water , and even other fry just from the egg , ? he was growing at such a rate that presently the fierce water-beetles and the baby trout ceased to have any terrors for him . And at last , turning savagely as one of his old tormenters passed by , he caught a small beetle between his jaws and made a meal of him . A - row days later one of the baby trout was too slow in getting out of his way . He made a dart , caught his former tyrant , and , though the latter was nearly an inch long , found no difficulty in swallowing him head first . By this time the little salmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what those learned in matters pertaining to the salmon would have called a " parr . " His coloring was very beautiful , in a higher key than the coloring of a trout , and more brilliant , if less showy . There was none of the pink of the trout , but a clear silvery tone on sides and belly , with a shining blueblack along the back . The sides were marked with a row of black dots , set far apart , and accentuated with a yellow flush around them , and another row of spots of most vivid scarlet . Along the sides also ran a row of broad , vertical , bluish-gray bars ? the badge of the young of all the salmon tribe . He was a slender , strong-finned , finely moulded little fish , built to have his dwelling in swift currents and to conquer turbulent rapids By this time there were not more than twoscore of his brothers and sisters left alive , and these scattered far and wide over the shoaling stream . It was high summer in the Quah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show its ledges and sandy bars above water . Deep green the full-leaved boughs of elm and ash , poplar and maple , leaned above the current ; and along the little meadows which here and there bordered the stream , where the lumbermen had had camps or " landings , " the misty pink-purple blossoms of the milkweed poured a wild sweetness upon the air . In a shallow run near the shore , where the sunlight fell mottled through an overhanging " sweeper , " and the current was about eight inches deep and there was no pool near to tempt the larger fish , the active and wary little " parr " took up his home . The same run was chosen by three of his fellows also , and by a couple of small trout of about the same size . But there was room enough in that run for all of them , so the association was harmonious . Lying with his head upstream , his long fins and broad tail slowly waving to hold him in his position against the current , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the untiring current . Sometimes it was a luckless leaf-grub or a caddisworm torn from its moorings that came tumbling and bumping down along the smooth pebbles of the bottom , to be gathered into the young salmon 's eager maw . Sometimes it was a fly or moth or bee or beetle that came dancing down with drenched , helpless wings along the tops of the ripples . And once in a while a pink-shelled baby crawfish in its wanderings would come sidling across the run , and be promptly gobbled up , for all the futile threatenings of its tiny claws . The river was liberal in its providing for its most favored children , these aristocratic and beautiful parr , so the youngster grew apace in his bright run . Happy though his life was now in very kind of weather , he was still beset . ith perils . He had , of course , no longer anything to fear from the journeying ; tickers with their small , toothless mouths ; but now and then a big-mouthed , red-bellied , savage trout would pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one of the little occupants . In this way two of the parr and one of the little troutdisappeared ? the trout-folk having no prejudice whatever against cannibalism . But our pioneer , ceaselessly on the watch and ever matchlessly nimble , always succeeded in keeping well out of the way . Once he had a horrible scare , when a seven-pound salmon , astray from the main channel , made his way cautiously up the middle of the run and scraped over the bar . In this case , however , the alarm was groundless , for the stranger was not seeking food , but only a way out of the embarrassing shallows . Another peril that kept the young parr on the alert ? an ever-imminent and particularly appalling peril wasthe foraging of the kingfishers . A pair of these noisy and diligent birds had their nest of six little ones in a hole in the red bluff just above the run , and they took ceaseless tribute from the finny tribes of the river . All through the summer and autumn the little parr was kept very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing in the cheerful , shallow run beneath the cedar . When the early autumn rains swelled the volume of the Great South Branch , he first realized how numerous were the big salmon in the stream ? fish which had kept carefully clear of the shallow places wherein he had spent the summer . Though he held himself well aloof from these big fish ? which , indeed , never paid him any attention whatever , ? he noticed them playing tempestuously , leaping high out of the pools , and very busy night and morning on the gravel bars , where they seemed to be digging with their powerful snouts . Still later in the season , when , instead of flies and beetles , there fell upon the darkening surface of the river little pale specks which vanished as he snatched at them , he grew fiercely and inexplicably discontented . What he longed for he did not know ; but he knew it was nowhere in the waters around him , neither along the edges of the shore , where now the ice was forming in little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salmon ? their sides lean and flat , their brilliant colors darkened and faded ? swimming down languidly with the strenuous current . Hitherto their movements had been all up-stream -- upward , upward incessantly and gladly . Now the old energy and joy of life seemed quite gone out of them . Nevertheless , they all seemed very anxious to go somewhere , and the way to that somewhere appeared to be down-stream . Hardly knowing what he did , and not at all knowing why he did it , the little parr found himself slipping down-stream with them . He had grown vastly in size and strength , while his vivid and varied hues had begun to soften appreciably . In fact , he was now no longer a parr , but a " smolt " ; and after the ordained custom of his kind , he was on his way down to the sea . Long-finned and full of vigor , the lit , tle smolt was not dismayed when he came to heavier water , exchanging the region of the , gravelly bars for a space of broken ledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashed itself into foam . Through these loud chutes and miniature falls he shot safely , though not , at first , without some trepidation . The lean , slab-sided salmon , or " slinks , " who were his travelling companions , served as his involuntary guides . Except to make use of them in this way once or twice , he paid them little attention ; though now and again a big lanternjawed fellow would rush at him with a sort of half-hearted fury , compelling him to make a hurried retreat . The Great South Branch , soon after the region of the wild ledges was past , fell into quiet ways , and crept for a few miles with deep , untroubled current through a land of alders . Here the winter , which had by this time settled down upon the Quah Davie country , had its will , and the river was frozen and snow-covered from shore to shore . The little smolt , as he journeyed beneath the ice , was puzzled and disturbed by the unusual dimness of the light that filtered down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he soon left behind . Swollen by the influx of several lesser streams , the Great South now burst its fetters and thundered along through a series of tumultuous rapids . Then above the thunder of these rapids came a louder , heavier roar . A moment more and he was hurled onward bewilderingly , dashed downward through a smother of broken water which held so much air in it that it almost choked him , and shot into a great , deep , swirling pool , where many " slinks " a few slim smolt like himself were swimming lazily hither and thither . He had successfully made the descent of the South Branch Falls . After a very brief rest in the basin below the falls to recover his selfpossession , the smolt , with many other migrants , resumed his seaward journey . The Great South presently , with a long rush , united its waters with those of the main . Quala Davie . Down this fullflowing stream he swam steadily for three uneventful days , to find himself at length in a mighty river whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greenish flood in which he had been born . And barely had he become ' accustomed to it when another and more startling change confronted him . The current , flowing strongly in one direction , would change for a time and flow directly against him . A strange , bitter taste was in the water . The great salt tides were rushing up to welcome him . He was nearing the sea . At first the brackishness in the water repelled him ; but almost at once he found himself accepting it with avidity . At the same time he could not but observe a sudden awakening of interest in life among the languid " slinks . " They began to show -a better appetite , to move about more alertly , to make themselves more dangerous to the small fish which crowded their paths . The water grew more and more salt ? yet with an ever-increasing zest to it which made the smolt amazingly keen for his food . Then the shield of ice above him , beneath which he had for so long travelled , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves he felt the sunlight streaming down to him unimpeded . He had reached the sea . The smolt , with others like himself , kept travelling more or less , in the company of the reviving " slinks . " Like all the rest of the strong-finned , silver-sided host , he was now feeding with a ravenousness of appetite unknown to him in the old days of rapid and pool . His food was chiefly the very tiny creatures of the sea ? shell-fish from the deep-covered rocks and floating masses of weed , young fry swimming in schools , jelly-fish of various sorts , and the myriad minute sea things which made certain belts and patches of the sea , at times , almost like a kind of soup ready to his eager palate . Ever north and north swam the silver host , seeking those cold currents from the pole which are as thick with life as the lands they wash are lifeless . Very deep they swam ? so deep that , countless as their armies were , they left no trace to betray them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly glimmering depths the slow tide stirred softly . unmoved by whatever arctic storm might rave and shriek over its surface . In this gloom the tiny creatures of the sea shone by their own pale phosphorescence , and in such unimaginable millions did they swarm that the journeying salmon had but to open their mouths to be fed . At this depth , too , they had but little persecution from the more swift and powerful hunters of the sea ? the big-mouthed whales , the sharks , and the porpoises . When the young salmon had been about three months in the sea , growing diligently all the time , a strange but potent influence impelled him , along with most of his companioning hordes , to turn and journey backward toward the coast whence he had come . He was now about five pounds in weight , and if he had fallen into the hands of a fisherman he would have been labelled a " grilse . " As the big grilse journeyed he went on growing daily , till by the time he found himself back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds in weight . As he mounted nearer the surface and drew inshore he passed the mouths of various rivers and encountered swirling currents of brackish water . At each of these river mouths numbers of the host would separate and turn up the freshening tide . But our grilse kept right on , making unerringly for his mighty native stream . And those that continued with him were more in number than those that turned aside . It was during this journey down offshore that perils once more began to assail the young salmon ? perils which it took all his good luck and activity to evade . For one thing , there were dogfish . These miniature sharks , with their savage mouths set far under their snouts , were no match for the grilse or any of his kind in speed ; but the latter , being unsuspicious , came very near being caught unawares . A swift sweep of his long fins and powerful tail saved him , just in time . He shot away like a silver streak just as the fierce jaws snapped sharply at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the approach of any fish in the least degree larger than himself . And in the course of this watchfulness he saw many of his kinsmen caught and torn to pieces by these ravening dogfish , who are the very wolves of the sea . Another and equally deadly peril was one that took several forms . Once , as he swam swiftly but easily onward , he saw a number of his companions , who chanced to he a little ahead of him , HUT abruptly and engage in what seemed to him a meaningless struggle . In a moment he detected a mesh of fine , brown lines , which seemed to surround and grapple with the unfortunate fish . Not waiting to investigate further , he retreated with a nervous flurry of speed . Then , not to be deterred in his homeward progress , he dived almost to the bottom and continued his journey , not returning toward the dangerous surface till he was many a mile beyond the throttling peril of the drift-net . Leagues up the great river , after mounting several noisy but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first lime in a deep and spacious pool which swarmed with his fellows . A day 's journey beyond the pool , a great outrush of colder water , greenwhite against the amber tide of the main river , greeted the returning grilse , and he found himself in the mouth of his native Quah Davie . It was a scantier and shallower stream , however , than when he left it , for now the long heats of the summer had shrunken ell the watercourses . As he mounted the clear current he now encountered fierce rapids and ledges boiling with foam , which put his swimming prowess to the test . After a day of these rapids and ledges , he felt quite ready to halt once more in a great green pool , where two lively brooks , tumbling in from either shore , kept the surface flecked with whirling foam . Here the invigorating coolness of the water speedily refreshed him , and he fell to feeding on the various insects brought down by the meeting currents . The pool was thronged with grilse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful whitefish or a group of sluggish suckers , whom he ignored . When the moon rose white over the black serried masses of the fir woods , silvering the pool , the big grilse , obeying a sudden caprice , shot upwards with a mighty surge of fins and tail , and hurled himself high into the still air . Falling back with a resounding splash , he repeated the feat again and again . He had discovered the fascination of diving upward into the unknown and alien element of the air . Others of his kindred , large and small , had made the same discovery , and the wilderness silence was broken with splash after splash as the tense , silver shapes shot up , gleamed for an instant , and fell back . As the noise of the mysterious play echoed on the night air , a black bear crept down to the water 's edge on one side of the stream , and a lynx stole out to the end of a log on the other side , each hoping that some unwary player might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept out in the safe deeps , and the keeneyed watchers watched in vain as the round moon climbed the clean heights of the sky . After a few days in this pool , he was surprised one early morning by the sight of a long , dark shape gliding over the surface . From its side , near the hinder end , a curious narrow fin thrust downward from time to time , and with heavy swirls propelled the dark shape . The strange apparition disturbed him , and he grew restless and watchful . A few minutes after it had passed there came a faint splash on the surface above him , and a big , odd-looking fly appeared . It sank an inch or two , moved against the current , and was then withdrawn . But when , a moment later , the strange fly appeared again , he was amazed to see one of the biggest salmon in the pool rise lazily and suck it down . The next . instant there was a terrific commotion . He saw the great fish rush hither and thither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whitefish on the bottom , now splashing upon the surface and leaping half his length into the air . Very clearly the cunning grilse understood what it all meant . For many long minutes he watched the struggle , which showed no sign of ending . Then , disgusted and apprehensive , he forsook the pool , darting beneath the canoe as he did so , and continued his journey up-stream . Later in the day the returning traveller came to the mouth of the Great South Branch . Without hesitation he turned up that turbulent but shrunken stream , knowing it for his own ; and he made no stops till he reached the deep , green , foamy pool at the foot of the falls . Being still comparatively fresh and very restless , he swam all around the pool , and took a crafty survey of the terrific obstacle before him . But among the sojourners in the pool were many fish with bleeding sides , who had essayed the leap in vain and were waiting to recuperate their energies for another effort , He , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The falls of the Big South were about twelve feet in total height . There were two leaps , the upper one , of about three feet , rolling down into a hollow shelf of sandstone some three or four feet in width , and the lower dropping nine feet sheer into the pool . Most of the face of this fall , at this stage of the water , was lashed into foam by fissures and projecting angles of rock , but on the right of the main volume the stream fell in a clear , green column . Up the front of this column the grilse presently flung himself , striking the water about a foot from the top . As he struck , the impetus of his leap not yet exhausted , his powerful fins and tail took firm hold of the solid water and urged him upward . Over the dip he shot , into the boiling turmoil of the shelf , then onward over the great surge of the upper dip . He had triumphed easily , and the way was clear before him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day there were new arrivals at the spawning-beds , and among them the strong and wary grilse soon found a mate . She was considerably larger than he ? a trim young salmon of the second year and perhaps nine pounds in weight . But his radiant coloring , his strength and his activity , as he swam around her and displayed his charms , appeared to content her . With his bony nose he dug her a circular nest in the gravel , where the current ran clear but not too strong ; and in this nest she laid her countless eggs , while he rubbed his side caressingly against her shining flanks . When her eggs were all laid and fertilized he drifted away from her , dropped down to the nearest pool , and lay there sluggish and uninterested for a while , until , seized once more by the longing for the great salt tides , he joined a returning company of " slinks " and hurried back down-river to the sea . When he reached the deep sea and regained his appetite among the sweeping tides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became smaller in proportion to his bulk ; and he was no longer a grilse , but a salmon . Adventures , perils , interests , appetites , were all much the same as during his first season in the sea . Only he now swam with a certain majesty , ignoring the grilse and smaller salmon who swam and fed beside him ; for he was of splendid stature , one of the lords of his kind . This time he let nearly the whole round of the year go by , feeding at leisure , and lazily dodging the seals , among the icy but populous tides that swing beyond the mouth of Hudson Strait . Then , late the following winter , long before the dark earth had any word of spring , spring stirred secretly in his veins , and he remembered the sunny gravel bars of the Great South Branch ; he began to swim tirelessly southward . It was late May when the returning salmon , having successfully eluded the snares of the nets and the assaults of harbor-seal and dogfish , came again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more in its sweet , amber current . He was now a good thirty-five pounds in weight , and his clean blue and silver body was adorned with fine markings of extraordinary brilliancy . Through rapid and chute and pool he darted tirelessly , and up the Great South Branch , sill he found himself in the boiling basin of green and foam at the foot of the falls . He knew that he had passed the barrier before , reaching those bright , gravelled reaches of which he was desirous . A summons which he could not disobey was urging him on . After a short rest be suddenly aroused himself , darted like a flash of silver through the green flood , and shot straight up the face of the fall . Within three feet of the crest he came , hung curved like a bow for a fraction of a second , glittering and splendid , then fell back into the white smother . Again and yet again he essayed the leap , gaining perhaps a fuot on the second trial , but falling far short on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great impact of the waters as he fell back defenceless , he retired to the quietest depth of the pool to recover his strength . Through the turmoil he saw the wide , shallow , clear-glittering gravel bars of the upper stream , golden under the sun and blue-white under the moon ; and be saw the loud barrier to be passed before he could reach them . Again he flashed up , with a power and swiftness that seemed irresistible , and again he shot into the spray-thick air on the face of the fall . Again he hung there for half a heart-beat , spent , to fall back baffled and confused , Again and again , however , he flashed upward to the trial . Again and again the rock teeth hidden in the foam caught and tore him as he fell . At last , all but stunned and altogether bewildered , he swam feebly into an eddy close to shore and half turned upon his side , his gills opening and closing violently . A visitor from the hills had come shambling down to the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quail Davie . Valley . Sitting contemplatively on her haunches , with little , cunning eyes she had watched the vain leaps of the salmon . As the efforts of the brave fish grew feebler and feebler she drew down closer and closer to the edge of the water , till it frothed about her feet . When , at last , the salmon came blindly into the eddy and turned upon its side , the bear crept forward like a eat , crouched , ? and a great black paw shot around with a clutching sweep . Gasping and quivering , the salmon was thrown up upon the rocks . Then white teeth , savage but merciful , bit through the back of the neck ; and unstruggling he was carried to a thicket in the quiet above the falls .
