It is something of a coincidence that Congress met on the very day that the International Shipping Trust - went into operation Senator Frye sees in this conjunction one argument more for Passing the Ship Subsidy Bill . Here is this vast combine , willing to spend $50,000 , - 000 on new steamers if Congress will only furnish half the money . The Maine Senator is no doubt in earnest , but if he makes such a proposal on the floor of Congress it will be received with shouts of laughter . A bill to pension Crcesus would have as good a chance of passing . Ship subsidies are dead , nor does it require a post-mortem to determine what killed them . Mr. Morgan did it with his little syndicate . The Comptroller of the Currency , in his annual report , recommends that national banks be allowed to issue notes over and above the amount of their security bonds , beginning with 20 per cent . of their capital , and increasing gradually to 50 per cent . " A graduated tax on the amount issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their redemption and return to the issuing bank , would result in the necessary contraction when the circulation became redundant and the notes were not needed in business . " This is very true , but it is also true that ample provisions for their redemption would produce this result without the graduated tax or any tax different from that which the law now imposes Since the public pay for the use of all she notes they take out and keep out , they can be depended on to return all that they do not really need . All that they do really need they ought to have , and the Government need concern itself only with their goodness The Comptroller 's report is , nevertheless , a notable and helpful communication . It presents , in the way least likely to cause alarm , the arguments in favor of an " assets currency . " While disclaiming any originality for the suggestions made under this head , the report is well timed to meet and support a growing public demand for a currency more responsive to the varying needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As was expected , Secretary Moody 's first annual report makes an earnest appeal for more officers and men for the navy . Unlike his predecessor , he passes over the question of more ships with the moderate statement that he believes it to be his " duty to recommend a eontinuance without interruption of the increase of ships " The precise type of ships he is quite willing to leave to the wisdom of Congress . He is even ready to admit that there are " differences of opinion among naval authorities " upon this point , and therefore he thinks that two battle-ships will about fill the bill . This is in refreshing contrast to the perfervid appeals of his predecessor , whose insistence that the spending of $100,000 , - 000 on battle-ships was the best possible use to which the money could be put in the interest of labor , made him a laughing-stock . Secretary Moody 's latest tables as to the dearth of officers show that there will be a deficiency of 1,360 at the end of the next four years . Apparently , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men . If we build two more battleships and a few more cruisers every year , we have no doubt that tables could be prepared showing that by 1910 we shall need 2,360 more officers to man our swollen fleets , and so on ad inAnytuni , . If it is not time , as we think it is , to stop building more ships , it is at least time for our legislators to sit down and formulate a distinct policy , fixing definite bounds to our naval expansion and allowing the public to pass upon them . Mr. James Breck Perkins , the historian , who is Congressman from the Rochester district , has been interviewed by the Democrat and Chronicle of that city on several subjects appertaining to his public duties , and among others that of the tariff . He says that he intends to introduce two bills at the opening of the session  --  one to repeal the duties on coal and meats , and the other to repeal those on hides and rough lumber , clapboards , and shingles . He doubts whether either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he thinks that it would be good politics for the Republican party to pass the former of the two within a week after the session begins . Mr. Perkins is a protectionist , but says that he does not intend to be humbugged by names . A duty of 67 cents per ton on coal and of 5 cents per pound on beef is not Protection , but an imposition on American laborers and manufacturers . " Sooner or later , " he adds , " bills like these will be passed . If , while I represent this district in Congress , I can in any way contribute to reducing the price of the coal that burns in the stove , or lessening the cost of the meat that is cooked in the kitchen ; can make it possible for the manufacturer to turn out his shoes cheaper , and the artisan to build his house for less money , I shall feel that I have been of some service to my constituents . " Mr. Perkins is well qualified by training and reputation to become a leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . The failure of the attempt to settle the anthracite dispute by direct negotiations shows that the matter was so complicated as to require the services of an impartial commission . That the pressure to carry out the arbitration by commission should come from the independent operators is also highly significant . These gentlemen are in a better position than the railroad mining companies to deal at first hand with their own workmen , while they gain correspondingly little from general agreements Their belief that the whole anthracite situation should be presented before the special commission and given to the public will be generally shared , for no settlement of the dispute is likely to be permanent unless it has the approval of the public and is openly made on the basis of facts . , The sudden displacement of the Minister of Colombia at Washington and the appointment of the Secretary of Legation to tali e charge of the negotiations respecting the Panama Canal , point to an early adjustment of the questions at issue . It is said in explanation of Minister Concha 's stubbornness on this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the strip of land through which the canal must pass would be a violation of the Constitution of Colombia , which forbids the abrogation of sovereignty over any part of her territory . Of course , this is a respectable position for any government to take , and for any Minister to insist upon if his Government so holds . Yet that view seems somewhat incongruous with the power granted to the United States by treaty to keep the Panama Railway open , which power was exercised by us only a few weeks ago , when an American Admiral sent an armed force to remove obstructions to transit placed there by other armed forces . This was or was not an infringement of sovereignty , according to the viewpoint of the individual observer . If he is a strict constructionist he will say that it was ; if not , not . But , in fact , this power was granted to us when the Panama Railway received its charter , and has been frequently exercised without protest from the Government of Colombia . Possibly the Constitution of Colombia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All these questions , however , seem likely to be settled satisfactorily , now that the Government at Bogota has taken them out of the hands of Mr. Concha . Secretary Hay seems to have scored another victory of considerable importance . The London Daily News , commenting on the situation in Venezuela , holds that if the United States is to have the privileges of the Monroe Doctrine , she should also have its duties , among which is that of preventing the South American republics from becoming a danger to the civilized world . The Daily News here shows a deficiency in the sense of humor which we have often noticed in the attempts of statesmen and publicists of the Old World to understand the Doctrine . The great merit of the Doctrine lies in the fact that its limitations have never been defined . Consequently , it is adapted to all sorts of emergencies . It is like the auctioneer 's garment , " large enough for any man and small enough for any boy " It fits the case of Venezuela now just as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that country is higgling over her debts to England and Germany , relying on the United States either to give bail for her , or to prevent the creditors from collecting their money by seizing her custom-houses . According to the latest advices from Washington , we shall do neither . The Doctrine never made us responsible for the borrowings or pilferings of the transient governments of Central and South America . The only thing that could make us responsible for such claims would be an attempt on our part to prevent other nations from collecting what is due to them , and using such force as may be needful to that end . The question may be asked , What is due to them ? Anything is due to them which they have our permission to collect . This shows the adaptability of the Doctrine to all possible cases . The monetary situation in Mexico deserves the attention of the ex-Bryanites Our gold dollar is worth $2.85 in Mexican silver . That is , the national money is cheap and plentiful . The planters , though probably ignorant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap dollar will stay in the country , and feel that the widening ratio of silver to gold is a matter which affects only the bankers and merchants of the cities . Thus a rudimentary division of the nation into " silverites " and " gold bugs " is already apparent . How long the agrarian classes will be delighted to receive more dollars which are progressively worth less in gold or in goods , remains to be seen . It always takes a certain time to discover the fallacy of high prices paid in a depreciated currency . But Mexican bankers and importers are under no illusions in this matter . They are already making gold contracts , and reckoning with a fluctuating foreign exchange . It will be interesting to see if this capitalistic pref erence for the yellow metal will not produce a Populistic movement in behalf of the dollar of the fathers . But the Mexicans have this advantage over ourselves , that , while the people are subject to all sorts of political aberrations , the Government will treat the monetary problem in the cold light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver are not likely to be cited before the Congress of Mexico . We are much pleased with the " authoritative " announcement from Platt 's friends in Washington that he is willing to abdicate on condition that his son Frank be elected in his stead . Why not ? If the Senatorship is Mr. Platt 's personal property  --  as he undoubtedly considers it to be  --  why should he not be allowed to make it over as a family heirloom to his dutiful son ? Simon Cameron passed on the Pennsylvania Senatorship to his son Don , just as Quay is understood to be making ready to elevate his son Dick to our hereditary House of Peers ; why should not Platt be entitled to do what he will with his own in similar fashion ? The son could not be a more useless Senator than the father . He could vote as straight , be as dumb , and as eagerly grab all the patronage in sight . What more would New York have in the way of a representative ? We fear , however , that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of swallowing everything bearing the name of Platt without gagging . Frank Platt has so publicly , and on so many occasions , displayed what Swinburne calls " facetious idiocy , " that he would have to pay a thumping inheritance tax before being allowed to take over the Senatorship under his father 's will . Popular discussions on the stump during the recent campaign doubtless led many persons to suppose that the canal improvements in this State could be carried out forthwith , whenever one party or the other said the word . Those who gathered this impression must have been somewhat surprised , during the last few days , to learn that nothing like agreement exists on so important a detail as the route of the enlarged waterway . Of course , the questions of route must be settled before the people can be asked intelligently to pass upon the proposed expenditures , and it is really an encouraging circumstance that the serious consideration of this problem has begun . The decision lies between the lake route , which contemplates a use of Lake Ontario for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route across the State substantially following the line of the present Erie Canal . The advantages claimed for the lake route , which has been favorably reported on by State Engineer Bond , are less cost and smaller maintenance charges , besides shorter time required to traverse the canal . These claims undoubtedly have a substantial basis . Engineer Bond has estimated that the canal , by the lake route , could be improved to 1,000-ton barge capacity , and the present Erie and Champlain canals substantially enlarged at a cost of $60,000,000 , which is $20,000,000 less than the cost of a similar canal over the present route . The estimated difference in time favorable to the lake route is thirty-five hours for barges and forty-five hours for propellers . With the use of Lake Ontario and also of Oneida Lake , there would be 195 miles of open waterway , requiring no maintenance whatever . These arguments , though forcible , are by no means conclusive The claims made for the route across the State are exceedingly strong . The lake route proposed would leave out Rochester and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which owe their importance in part to their positions on the line of the present canal Side lines and feeders for the use of these centres would but lamely answer their needs Buffalo , also , has reason to fear the lake route , and is emphatically against it . While it contemplates transhipment at Buffalo , and provides for the use of practically the present route from Buffalo to Lockport , it is quite likely that shippers might readily fall into the habit of sending their grain and other freight by steamer through the Welland Canal from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario and thence over the open lake to Oswego , there to tranship and enter the barge canal . This might be fine for Oswego , but it would arouse fear lest the enlarged canal might become a mere chute for the passage of freight to this port , without other benefit to the State . If it is true that local traffic should be an important feature of the improved canal ( and it seems to us that it ought to be ) , the objections to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the friends of the canal improvement project must take into account the political bearing of the two propositions . How can a route be adopted which is opposed by Buffalo , Rochester , Syracuse , and many other communities formerly counted as advocates of the canal improvements ? Much curiosity , and some perplexity , exist in regard to the Elevated and Subway merger . The question is asked , what the Subway enterprise has to gain by leasing the Elevated roads , on terms which are certainly very liberal . The 7 per cent . dividend to be guaranteed on Elevated shares is pledged to a property which has been paying only 4 for Eve years past , whose highest record has been 6 , and whose capital stock is being heavily increased . The two undertakings will , of course , be competitors at the completion of the Underground ; they are , for the most part , parallel enterprises . Experience with this city 's development has taught that inroads of new competition on the earnings of a local transportation enterprise will be only temporary ; diversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offset by pressure of increased traffic on both But experience has also shown . Lnat shrinkage of the older enterprise 's earnings may , in the interim , be severe . When the surface railways , in the nineties , extended their facilities and became , in fact , competitors for the Elevated 's " short haul " traffic , each of the above-named principles was demonstrated . During the fiscal year 1893 , the Elevated system carried 219,021,000 passengers , and earned $11,137,000 . Yet within six years its passenger movement had declined to 177,204,000 , and its earnings to $9,325,000 . About that time , as residents of the city very well remember , pressure of moving population overflowed even the greatly expanded facilities of the surface lines , until , in the fiscal year just closed , passenger traffic on the Elevated had risen to the high-water-mark of 223,427,000 , with earnings of $11,067,000 . It is announced , as one purpose of the pending merger , to mitigate the violence of this intervening shrinkage . How it can be done by the act of a management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare of other railway systems , plays little part in the Subway and Elevated plans ; for the reason that rates per passenger are virtually fixed . Nor is it likely that competition can be modified by avoiding , on one line , train schedules which should draw patronage from the other . This question , too , is practically decided in advance for each . The probability is that the amalgamators have in mind possibilities of " splitting of fares " by one or the other company with the surface lines  --  or , later on , with railways , such as the Pennsylvania or the Central , whose terminals touch the local railway stations . This might conceivably be used as a weapon of competition . If this supposition be correct , it will be interesting to see how the general plan works out . The rather strong feeling in financial circles has been that close cooperation between the various local and outside transportation enter-prices in the matter of travelling facilities is a certainty of the future . If labor unions or any of their members have standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply for the legal remedy of injunction , and in a proper case receive it , even though they are strikers and the injunction is sought to restrain their former employers . What lends novelty to the case of this kind at Vineland , N. J. , is the fact that it indicates that at least the Glass Bottle Blowers ' Association of the United States and Canada is willing to countenance " government by injunction " provided it be on their side . This association is seeking to restrain the Jonas Glass Company of Minotola , N. J , " from interfering with the business of the strikers " It is charged in the complaint that the company has attempted to intimidate , frighten , and drive away the labor association and its officers , that strikers who gathered at the railway station to meet incoming trains bringing non-union workmen have been assaulted with force of arms by persons hired by the company , and that representatives of the company have threatened to kill some of the strikers and to destroy the strike headquarters The court , therefore , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause has been granted . The proceedings on the return day will be watched with great interest . Careful reviews of the work of Circuit-Attorney Folk , who has broken up the boodle ling in St. Louis , show that the two great qualities which have brought him his success are fearlessness and single-mindedness . Ills course and character are worth studying by reformers everywhere . " I told the men who nominated me that I did n't want the office , " said Mr. Folk the other day , " for I felt that if elected the task for me would he tremendous . But I was elected , and I set about to do my duty as I saw it . I had to prosecute some of those very men who nominated me . Some of them are in the penitentiary , some are under bonds as indicted perjurers and bribe-takers . " The best of this is that it is true , and it is also true that Mr. Folk has been able to convict not only the bribe-takers , but some of the wealthy bribe-givers as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of offices , but it is quite clear that he has not been actuated by motives of political ambition . " I do n't think I could be elected for another term , " he said recently , and added grimly : " Ninety-nine per cent . of the people are honest and want honest government , but , unfortunately , the remaining one per cent . are perniciously active . " Though a Democrat , Mr. Folk is meeting the strong opposition now of the Democratic machine . Naturally , the Democratic leaders are not anxious to advance him , for he has promised them that if he gets a chance he will expose and punish the State boodlers as he has the corruptionists in St. Louis . By an excellent provision in the laws of Indiana , a sheriff who allows a prisoner placed in his custody to be lynched forfeits his office . Gov . Durbin has acted promptly in the case of Sheriff Dudley of Sullivan County , who permitted , if he did not connive at , the lynching of a negro on November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office over to the county coroner . The sheriff may , however , be reinstated if he proves that he was really powerless to prevent the outrage . Meanwhile , his friends assert that the delay in sending troops was the real cause of the disgrace . The Indianapolis journal , in commenting on the affair , says that it had " all the features of a flagrant violation of the law , " and adds that there " was no doubt of the prisoner 's speedy trial , conviction , and punishment . " By the Indiana law of 1901 , assisting at a lynching is murder ; and merely looking on is a , crime punishable by not less than two or more than twenty-one years ' imprisonment . The power and duty to prosecute were taken out of the hands of the local law officers and placed in those of the State 's Attorney-General . The latter is expected to act at once in this case , which is the first under the new law . If Indiana can make examples of a dozen of these murderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , for its course in the matter will attract national attention . Irish troubles , which recently looked at their worst , seem likely to be compounded temporarily through conference of the landlords and tenants . Mr. Johu Redmond has almost expressed confidence in the ability of the Government to deal successfully with the land question , and apparently the recent jailing of Irish editors and members of Parliament under the Crimes Act has been quite forgotten . The present good feeling is a favorable antecedent tothe land-purchase bill which Mr. Balfour has promised to introduce at the next session of Parliament . It is quite natural that the Irish should look for practical relief rather to Mr. Balfour than to the disorganized Liberals . The stalwarts , under Campbell-Bannerman , have by no means made their attitude clear in this matter . That they are in favor of thoroughgoing legislation they insist , but this is after all a generality , and it would be difficult to pin the regular Liberals down to open advocacy of Gladstonian home rule . If their attitude is ambiguous , that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to an Irish Parliament , but would see without concern a number of legislative bodies in Scotland , Wales , and Ireland , or even " one such body , " in each of these portions of the kingdom  --  which seems like home rule under the sweeter name of " devolution of power , " but may mean nothing at all except that Rosebery is in the mood of conciliation . Until the Liberals know their own mind on this subject and show signs of coming to their old strength , Mr. Redmond , and even his imprisOned colleagues , can hardly be blamed for looking to Mr. Balfour .
