 | What Johnson and most of the Southern people failed to understand ? and naturally so perhaps ? was the sudden injection of the mass of blacks into the political population of their section . As slaves the blacks had enjoyed neither civil nor political rights . They could not make contracts , not even the contract of marriage , neither could they acquire property , sue or be sued , or testify in the ordinary courts of justice . They were not even entitled to have surnames . Under the provisional governments instituted by Johnson something was done to bring both the public and the private law into harmony with the altered state of society . Unfortunately , however , more than one Southern State Legislature now passed laws in regard to the blacks which were far from being either wise or just . Such Legislation not only caused the freedmen to distrust their former owners and threw them into the arms of the carpetbaggers and scalawags , but produced genuine alarm throughout the North , where it was feared that the South , supported by Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Johnson 's policy of resolution was becoming more and more unpopular , therefore , when Congress convened in December , 1865 . Two reports made at about this time on the condition of the South did much to influence public opinion in the North . These were made by Carl Schurz and General Grant . The former , at Johnson 's request , had made an extensive tour through the South in the summer of 1865 . In the autumn of the same year Grant had paid a hurried visit to several Southern cities and on his return to Washington had given his impressions to the President in the form of a letter . The President transmitted both documents to Congress . The report of Schurz was so influential a factor in shaping the subsequent legislation adopted by Congress that it may be well to quote somewhat liberally the opinions therein expressed : If nothing were necessary , said Schurz , but to restore the machinery of government in the States lately in rebellion in point of form , the movements made to that end by the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is required that the Southern people should also accommodate themselves to the results of the war in point of spirit , these movements fall far short of what must be insisted upon . The report went on to say that the loyalty of the masses and most of the leaders of the Southern people consisted in submission to necessity . It was claimed that , except in individual cases , there was an entire absence of that national spirit which forms the basis of true loyalty and patriotism . The emancipation of the slaves is submitted to , continued Schurz , only in so far as chattel slavery in the old form could not be kept up . But although the freedman is no longer considered the property of the individual master , he is considered the slave of society , and all independent State legislation will share the tendency to make him such . The ordinances abolishing slavery passed by the conventions under the pressure of circumstances will not be looked upon as barring the establishment of a new form of servitude . Practical attempts on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a freeman may result in bloody collisions and will certainly plunge Southern society into restless fluctuations and anarchical confusion . Such evils can be prevented only by continuing the control of the national government in the South until free labor is fully developed and the new order of things perfected . This desirable result will be hastened by a firm declaration on the part of the government , that national control in the South will not cease until such results are secured . Only in this way can that society be established in the South which will render numerous itnmigration possible and such immigration would materially aid a favorable development of things . The solution of the problem would be very much facilitated by enabling all the loyal and free labor elements in the South to exercise a healthy influence upon legislation . It will hardly he possible to secure the freedman against oppressive class legislation , and private persecution , unless he be endowed with a certain measure of political power . As to the future peace and harmony of the union , it is of the highest importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another peculiar institution whose spirit is in conflict with the fundamental principles of our political system ; for as long as they cherish interests peculiar to them in preference to those they have in common kith the rest of the union , their loyalty will be uncertain . Grant was of the opinion that it would be advisable to retain troops in the South for the protection of both races , but he advised the employment of white soldiers there . He appears to have understood the Southern people better than Schurz and he took a more hopeful view generally of the situation . Grant commented on the unfortunate prevalence of vice and idleness among the blacks and attributed such evils in large measure to their in- flux into camps , towns , and cities . He thought the bulk of the Southern people had bowed to the decision of the sword , but wisely added what Schurz and many others failed to observe , that it ought not to be expected that opinions which had been held in the South for many years could be changed in a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance to the position that no Southern State ought to be re-admitted into the Union unless it granted the franchise to negroes . The President 's ideas of State sovereignty , to say nothing of his lack of sympathy with the blacks , caused him to oppose such a policy and from this time on the breach between the executive and the legislature widened . As early as February 2 , 1866 , the Senate had passed a civil rights bill in the interest of the freedman , and a few weeks later the bill passed the house of representatives , but it received the veto of the President . Shortly afterwards it passed both houses over his veto . Another measure to encounter the veto of the President was the act to create a Freedman 's Bureau , which eventually passed into a law over the head of the President . The object of the measure was to furnish aid and protection to colored persons , but the bureau was grossly mismanaged . Meanwhile , bad crops , the debates in Congress , the attitude of the President , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad blood between the whites and the blacks . As early as April 30 , 1866 , two churches for colored people were burned in Richmond , Va. , and a few months later a pitched battle occurred between the two races in New Orleans . These events led to the passage by Congress in June , 1866 , of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution , giving to the negroes the rights of citizenship , depriving those who had taken part in the secession movement of the right to vote , and placing all persons on an equality before the law . Much excitement was caused in the summer of 1866 by the attack of Irish Fenians on Canada . On June 3 General Meade was ordered to Buffalo to prevent operations from the American side , and President Johnson issued a proclamation forbidding the use of our territory as the base of operations against Great Britain 's possessions . This firm attitude avoided any further disturbances , and what at first threatened serious complications with Great Britain soon passed away .  | Several domestic events , in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1866 . On July 3 a $15,000 , - 000 fire occurred in Portland , Maine , in which the government lost heavily . In the same month Tennessee , the first Southern State reconstructed under the President 's theory , was re-admitted into the Union . Shortly afterwards Grant was promoted to a generalship , the highest office under our military system , while Farragut was made an admiral . On July 28 the Great Eastern arrived at Heart 's Content , New Foundland , with the Atlantic Cable . The scheme of uniting America and Europe by cable had been projected by Cyrus W. Field . After various unsuccessful experiments the plan was now an assured success . The effect of this wonderful achievement on the commercial , social , and political life of the world could not be exaggerated . The year 1867 witnessed the complete triumph of Congress over the President . As early as January 7 a bill was passed giving the negroes of the District of Columbia the right to vote . The measure was vetoed by Johnson , but was promptly passed over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the national legislature . The first of these was designed to check the pardoning power of the President and curtail his right of proclaiming a general amnesty to those who had espoused the cause of the South . The second act was aimed at another of the President 's prerogatives and sought to deprive him of the command of the army . The law was so artfully drawn that the President 's military orders were to be given to the general , who was not to be removed without the consent of the senate . As Grant was the general and his views were known to be opposed to those held by Johnson , it was hoped that in case an armed conflict should arise between the executive and Congress Johnson would be powerless . But the President was not a Charles I. and there was no Stafford . By the bills of March 2 , and March 23 , 1867 , Congress also passed the Reconstruction Acts . By the provisions of these acts all the Southern States , save Tennessee , were grouped into five military districts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preliminary division of England in the seventeenth century into major-general districts . The military rule thus set up in the South was to continue until a State convention should form a government in each commonwealth and  | ratify the fourteenth amendment , which had been ostentatiously defeated in the Southern , as well as in several of the Northern , States . The fourteenth amendment worked a two-fold hardship , for it not only extended the franchise to the blacks , most of whom were densely ignorant , but disfranchised many of the influential whites . On March 11 the military governors , five in number , were assigned to their respective districts in the South , and the provisional governments established by Johnson came to an end . The next ten years are the most dismal in American history . Had the South been foreign territory it might have fared better . Treaty rights would have been respected . Some heed , moreover , would have been paid to local needs and prejudices . As it was , however , the downfall of the Confederacy left no government with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State governments in the South disappeared . But if there was malignant prejudice among the men of the Wade and Stevens stamp , there was lack of intelligent statesmanship in the South , and there was a notable disposition among Southern leaders to extend to the blacks only such rights as the government forced them to grant . Congress continued to pass laws which professedly sought to harmonize the institutions of the country with the wide-spread alteration introduced by the war , and the President persisted in vetoing such measures only to see the acts passed over his veto . This led to the passage of the military bill already referred to , and the Civil Tenure of Office Act , which was directly against the appointing power of the executive and plainly unconstitutional . Both met with a presidential veto only to be followed by a legislative triumph . Meanwhile international questions of grave import received marked attention . On March 30 , 1867 , the President was able to announce the ratification by the Senate of the Treaty with Russia . By the terms of this convention Russia sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , now known as Alaska , and including the Aleutian Islands , ? the first of our insular possessions . Just why the purchase was made has never been pointed out very clearly . Some supposed at the time that it was a reward to Russia for her services to our government during  | the Civil War . At all events , the recent exploitation of the Klondike region , to say nothing of the timber resources of the land and the fur-bearing waters , will go far towards reconciling Americans to the negotiations . Still further interest in the region has been aroused by our recent acquisition of the Philippines . The other important diplomatic occurrence of 1867 was the execution of the Archduke Maximilian , so-called Emperor of Mexico , by the republican government of our sister nation . The Emperor Napoleon III . had taken advantage of our civil strife to interfere with the affairs of Mexico , but Mr. Seward had early reminded him of the Monroe doctrine . On the conclusion of hostilities such pressure was brought to bear upon the French emperor that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might easily have escaped , met with his tragic end . The unhappy fate of his wife , a half crazed suppliant at the courts of Europe , excited the commiseration of the whole world , but nothing could be done to rescue the couple from the predicament in which they had been placed by Napoleon 's cupidity . Meanwhile , dissensions in his Cabinet had caused Johnson to request the resignation of Stanton , the secretary of war . This order the latter declined to obey , whereupon he was suspended from public office and General Grant appointed in his place . This occurred in August , and the President 's action was made the basis of the articles of impeachment instituted against him by the House of Representatives . On December 4 , 1867 , there was organized at Washington the Patrons of Husbandry , or Farmers ' Grange , the forerunner of numerous associations of its kind which eventually brought about the passage of many important laws in the States as well as the inter-state commerce act of 1887 . The year 1868 witnessed the culmination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 6 he was censured by that body for his removal of Sheridan from the post of governor of the fifth military district . This was followed a few weeks later by Johnson 's expulsion of Stanton from the office of secretary of war and the appointment of General Thomas in his place . The feeling against the President was now so bitter that on February 24 the House of Representatives , by a vote of 126 to 57 , adopted articles of impeachment against him ; and on March 5 the Senate was organized as a Court of Impeachment . Chief Justice Chase presided .  | The trial of the President naturally aroused world-wide interest , for the spectacle of the Chief Magistrate of a nation summoned to the bar of his country was a novel one . The proceedings were attended daily by great crowds and lasted for several weeks . Each side was provided with able counsel . Among those who defended the President were Stanberry and Evarts . From its very commencement the trial was characterized by gross partisanship . As has been well said Johnson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time and again , moreover , when the Chief Justice refused to admit certain evidence his decision was overruled by the Senate in spite of the obvious correctness of Chase 's position . The upshot of the matter was that when the solemn farce terminated May 16 the vote stood 35 for conviction to 19 against it , ? the President thus escaped a conviction by one vote only , as it required a majority of two-thirds in order to sustain the impeachment . The democrats naturally voted for acquittal , and so also did a few republicans , who were bitterly denounced for their course . Four days after the termination of the impeachment proceedings the republican party , at its convention in Chicago , nominated General Grant for the presidency . On July 4 the democrats nominated Horatio Seymour , of New York , for the same position . Meanwhile Johnson sank still lower in public esteem by his undignified tour through the country ? " swinging the circle , " as it was called ? when he is said to have been seen more than once under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chinese embassy arrived in this country . At its head was Anson Burlinghame , who at one time had represented our government at Peking . He had so won the confidence of the Chinese that he was at the head of the Orientals who were visiting this country and Europe . It is interesting to note that the subsequent immigration of Chinese to this country , as well as many other aspects of our relations with China , may be traced in no small measure to the influence of this embassy . In the summer of 1868 Congress passed bills for the re-admission of Arkansas , North and South Carolina , Georgia , Louisiana , Alabama , and Florida . The President vetoed the acts , but they were passed over his veto . In these States the negroes , under the leadership of adventurers from the North ( carpet-baggers ) and native Southerners ( scalawags ) , who had been cast up to the  | surface of politics by the troubles of the day , organized the State governments and commenced an era of plunder that beggars description . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-admitted Congress declared , in spite of the President 's veto , should be excluded from the electoral college . At the election held on November 3 , Grant was elected President . He received 217 electoral votes out of 297 . The total popular vote was 5,722,984 . Of this number he received 3,015,071 . Ever since the close of the war the democratic party had labored to avert much of the radical legislation directed against the Southern States . Its course , however , wise or unwise , had been at least consistent . It is quite natural , therefore , to find that the Southern whites turned hopefully in its direction as the cords of reconstruction were drawn more and more tightly around them . As for Johnson ? to whose unfortunate course the South owed many of its woes ? little more remains to be said . The rest of his administration was spent quietly and on the inauguration of the new President he returned to his home in Tennessee . His administration had been chiefly occupied with political questions . Of course the financial situation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and urgent attention , and McCullough worked wonders in the treasury department . On the outbreak of the war the debt was about $60,000,000 , and it increased rapidly . Vast sums of money were borrowed . The tariff was also raised and direct taxes levied , notably on tobacco , whiskey , and incomes . Notwithstanding these facts paper money known as greenbacks was issued in abundance . Millions of dollars ' worth of bonds were also placed both on the domestic and the foreign market . The creation of the national banking system during the war had done something to relieve the situation , but on September 1 , 1865 , the national debt amounted to $2,756,432,751 . With the return of peace , however , every branch of industry took on a new lease of life and the debt began to be reduced rapidly . Finally , the question may be asked , How did reconstruction affect the Southern people , whites and blacks , and how did it affect the country at large ? From the point of view of public law , the policy was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially adopted , as in Tennessee , the white  | population suffered much from corrupt government . If , however , Congress had been broad and humane enough to recognize the prostrate condition of the South and the utter impossibility of altering in a day sentiments that were the outgrowth of centuries much of the bitterness o the period might have been averted . That the indiscriminate extension of the franchise to the blacks was a mistake is now generally conceded . If any one is disposed to doubt it , let him read the history of the period from 1868 to 1876 . The course of Congress also did much to estrange the two races as well as to develop a new form of sectionalism and one , too , that was quite as dangerous as that ended by the war . Reconstruction was not , however , without its benefits . In the field of private law the carpet-baggers , many of whom were trained lawyers , brought with them that spirit of legal reform that had already done much to ameliorate the common law in the North . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and forms , many of which were now swept away . There were also introduced some improvements in matters of local government , to say nothing of the impetus given the cause of popular education . Just at this particular time , moreover , it was not an unmixed evil for the Southern whites to be removed from the sphere of politics . For a number of years that subject had largely engrossed their time and attention , but their ruined condition now demanded every energy to provide for the wants of themselves and those dependent on them . Men and women worked as they had never worked before and found in it the hope and happiness that toil always brings . There was no time for idle lament or the grief that would have led to despair . And while the blacks were no more prepared for the suffrage than children are for the use of edged tools , they made gains in the field of civil rights that they could not otherwise have secured for a number of years . It is hard to believe , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's administration , that the ex-slaveholders would have voluntarily given the negroes the right to enforce contracts , own property , appear as witnesses in courts , and otherwise act as citizens . Perhaps it was unreasonable to expect it . And as dreadful as the case may have been , the national government acquired not a few valuable lessons during this period , ? lessons that may prove useful in its dealings with the peoples of its insular possessions .
