In a recent convention of the Royal Academy of Belgium , M.

The eagle verborum is taken from the Latin or its modern representatives ; all words are unchangeable ; the construction is that of the iaeo-Latin languages . Latin without inflections M.

He denies that any of the modern languages , even the English , can over become the international language of the learned world . This must be anartificial language .

While the fullest rubric of the present section is Make , which demands thirteen pages or thirty-nine columns , and requires a phrase-key at the end , and is surpassed in the entire Dictionary only by Go , the characteristic of our words in M is the great store drawn from African , Oriental , and South American sources , as a glance at the first five pages will show .

This last form , as a substantive , turns up in 1568 , as an adjective in 1597 , with Machiavel midway in 1570 .

Differing practices appear again in the case of Mail . " In England the word in ordinary use is limited to the dispatch of letters abroad , as , the Indian , mail , etc. ; or as short for mail-train . . .

Much light is thrown on what is English idiom or usage in several places in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accepted form of the phrase , and is at the front ( 1628 ) in the quotations . But at intermediate points " for , " " on , " and " upon the main " were ventured . If English idiom  --  that is , the genius of the language  --  justified these constructions , usage in the long run rejected them , they are English , yet not English . On the other hand , Main , for ' the chief part , ' as " the main of the morning news , " " the main of us , " would never come natural to an American , it is English idiom in a restricted sense , foreign to American usage , and still " good English . " The modern usage of Make , in the sense of ' to compose , write as an author , ' is , says Mr. Bradley , " difficult to reduce to rule .

" English idiom is apparently capricious in excluding many locutions which would seem to be parglel with these ; we can not , e. g. , use make with object a ride , a wall , ( of German anon Spazzergany maeliert ) .

In a recent number of the Reform Social ? M. tend Lavollee renews the lament over the depopulation of the rural parts of France . The great cities grow at the expense of the rest of the country , and the small ones grow at the expense of the hamlets . These are , in general , smaller in size than they were a century ago . During the five years ending in 1901 the population of the rural departments decreased by 766,823 ; Out of eighty-six departments , sixty-two were thus affected During the last half-century probably not one in ten of the small communes has increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one-third . Moreover , the death rate in the cities compared with the country is as 3 to 2 . The movement is not accounted for by the introduction of railways , as it has become more extensive during the last twenty-five years . No doubt the introduction of labor-saving machines has made it practicable to cultivate the soil with fewer men ; the product may be greater now than ever before Allowing for this cause , we still find that the barbarous system of compulsory division of estates , the enormous taxes on the transfer of land , and the system of military service would suffice to produce the effect . There is little inducement to build a permanent homestead so long as the law threatens its destruction when the next generation succeeds . Until this law is improved the birth rate in France will decline and the population be maintained only by foreign immigration Of course , the effect of life in the barracks is prejudicial to the institution of the family .

The " American Sportsman 's Library " can hardly be said to have made any great gain in its recent addition of a. volume on ' Guns , Ammunition , and Tackle , ' by various authors ( Macmillan ) . Capt . A. W. Money 's opening chapter , on the " Shotgun and Its Handling , " is marred by a defence of the amusement of live pigeon-shooting from traps . It is admitted that such shooting is cruel " from the humanitarian point of view , " but the humanitarian himself is assailed as an unpractical person who does not really know the difference between cruelty and its opposite . Fortunately , American sportsmen are rapidly reaching a level of ethical intelligence which enables them to discriminate between genuine ' hunting , with due regard for the game , and the useless slaughter of live birds in what is essentially target shooting .

Shelley ? An Essay , ' by Adolphus Alfred Jack ( London : Constable ) , is , in the language of the author 's note , " an attempt . . . to answer the question , Who is Shelley , and what is the attitude " in which , to understand him , we ought to approach his poetry ? " It can not be said that Mr. Jack is an altogether efficient guide for a person capable of asking " Who is Shelley ? " Nor is his endeavor to fix in a phrase the quality of Shelley 's poetry final . His exposition of the clear-eyed Shelleyan view of nature , the antithesis of the Wordsworthian fallacy , is perfectly convincing ; his appreciation of individual poems is always excellent , yet when he comes to consider the mould of Shelley 's mind as a whole , his notion that " Shelley sees things so clearly that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we take his meaning correctly , applicable to himself . The fact seems to be that so to imbue one 's self with the Shelleyan atmosphere as to become a sympathetic analyst of it , is to make the practice of objective criticism a matter of the extremest difficulty . But Mr. Jack has given us an essay which will provide the initiate student of Shelley 's poetry with very suggestive reading . The hundred-odd pages of his essay are compact of that sincere , reposeful scholarship of which Oxford seems to keep the secret still . It is a very sweet and clean piece of writing , admirably low and even in tone , heightened at intervals by a startlingly vivid phrase , as , for example , where it is said of " Adonais , " " Throughout the poem the words death and died - hoot their continual lament .

It is a review of the whole process by which th ( - Common Custom of the old local courts of England has been developed into a great modern system of jurisprudence . It touches on a host of subjects , such as equity and trial by jury , which are involved in this process , and the history and proper position of which in our corpus jicris have been made clear only in our own time . It is hardly necessary to say that whatever Sir Frederick Pollock touches he makes interesting .

" TWO STUDIES OF NAPOLEON Napoleon , : A Short Biography . By B. M Johnston . A. S. Barnes &; Co. 1904 . Napoleon . By Theodore Ayrault Dodge . Boston Houghton , Mifflin &; Co. 1904 . The jaded student of an endless bibliography may find it hard to believe that any one should come forward with a book which appears to differ in scope and treatment from all existing works on Napoleon . It is the impossible that happens , and two Napoleonic novelties have been produced almost simultaneously by writers using the English language . Mr. Johnston 's " Short Biography " is conceived in a spirit andwritten in a style which marks it off from existing sketches of the Emperor 's career , while the divorce which Mr. Dodge makes between politics and war gives a distinctive tone to his account of the great campaigns . Mr. Johnston 's book is popular history of the best class  --  scholarly , readable , and acute . When we call it readable we would emphasize and strengthen a term which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only possible to read this volume , but it is difficult to deny one 's self the pleasure of an uninterrupted perusal . Wequote the first paragraph as an example of the directness and selective skill which are observable throughout . " In the history of Napoleon Bonaparte we plunge into the characteristic at the very outset  --  the date of his birth . He was born either in 1768 or 1769 ; probably , but not certainly , in the latter year . As late as in 1796 , when he married , the date of his birth was given as February , 1768 ; later it was fixed at the 15th of August , 1769 . This is not a matter of vital importance , yet it is not without interest , for two reasons . In the first place , it is typical of Napoleon 's methods that he should have placed the celebration of his birthday at the same date as that of the Virgin Mary 's , which is one associated with rejoicing and merrymaking in all Latin countries . Another Interesting point in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the home of the Bonapartes , was Genoese ; a year later it was French If Napoleon was born in 1768 , he was- born a Genoese , if in 1769 , a Frenchman . " That signs of rapid composition are sometimes to be met with we shall not deny , but the narrative has dash , movement , and constant vitality . These qualities , added to the writer 's grasp of his subject , render the essay an excellent introduction to Napoleonic literature . One grave danger which Mr Johnston escapes is the temptation to moralize . In a book of less than 50,000 words there is no room for reflections on the manifold issues that grow out of Napoleon 's policy and conduct . Without pretending to maintain a tone of colorless impartiality , Mr. Johnston compacts his comment into a very brief space . What his own judgment of Napoleon is may be largely gathered from the character sketch which occurs in the first chapter : " He was given to violent bursts of temper , the occasional outbreaks of a nearly superhuman mental energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selfish considerations . He was Perhaps the greatest egotist the world has ever seen , with the result that he often ap. - plied his indomitable will and magnificent qualities to very low aims . Judged hastily and by ' certain traits alone , he might be thought to be little more than contemptible ? thus , in the matter of veracity He viewed lying from a strictly utilitarian point of view , and always said just what was convenient , so that his history , written from his own statements , would be little better than fiction . He played cards as he conducted warfare , obtaining every advantage he could , legitimate or otherwise . " This is a passage which one might expect to find in the pages of Seeley , but Mr. Johnston is much more open-minded than his English predecessor , and interprets Napoleon 's genius with fuller sympathy . For example , when speaking of the Emperor 's correspondence , he says : " In the thirty-two volumes published officially one might nearly say that there is not a superfluous word , not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with overpowering force from every page , and it may quite properly be said that the Correspondence of Napoleon is a great literary monument . It is safe to be predicted that it will be read when the names of , Chateaubriand , of Delavigne , and of Lam.artine are well-nigh for-gotten , " We should be glad to show , were it possible for us to do so within present limits . how Mr. Johnston enforces the main facts of Napoleon 's life by appropriate detail and lucid explanation . His account of military operations is particularly clear , and many readers will be indebted to him for their first real knowledge of the tactics which , were developed during the wars of the ' French Revolution . Especially minute-knowledge is revealed in his discussion , however brief , of the causes alebres in which each incident has become the nucleus of a polemical library . In general , Mr. Johnston holds a middle course , or rather he is too conservative to be led away by ex , aggerated hypotheses simply because cthey are new . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an epileptic , or modifies it until its peculiar significance has vanished At most , he observes , Napoleon was a very slight sufferer , and no epileptic ever showed greater clearness of intellect . " Historically speaking , to say that he was epileptic is probably untrue , and is certainly irrelevant and misleading " To give a further indication of Mr. Johnston 's general attitude , we may instance his comment on the execution of the three thousand Turkish prisoners who were taken at Jaffa . After citing the exculpation offered by purely military critics , he concludes : " This may be true , but it might also be pertinently asked . Was not the unprovoked attack of France on Malta and on Egypt at least as great a subject for reproach ? Is it not far more important to award blame for the waging of an unjust war than for what is only a military incident , of debatable necessity , occurring in the course of such a war ? " The public has an unfortunate tendency to admire the large books which it never reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fico We endeavor to give the present sketch some prominence , partly because it shows strong signs of talent , and partly because most readers will find it lucid though not voluminous The wars and character of Napoleon are such common topics of conversation that , to say the least , it is desirable for every one to know something about them Every historian who keeps his ears open knows how much drivel is talked by the " well-informed man " about the Emperor of the French , and can not escape the conviction that not one in ten is familiar with the distinction between the 13th Vend  --  nuaire and the 18th Brumaire . To all who would acquire the essential facts by the shortest possible cut , Mr Johnston 's volume can be recommended , and , unlike most short cuts , this is a safe one to take . Where we have found so much to praise , we shall hardly be accused of captiousness when we repeat that , in technical matters of style , Mr Johnston has not quite found his proper level . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has the ease and rapidity which are needed to do justice to the breadth of his information and the precision of his ideas But , unless our diagnosis is quite incorrect , facility of expression has been accompanied by a certain neglect of revision which , though slight in itself , is still noticeable . At the same time we must be sure to make our last word one of appreciation , for Mr. Johnston has gifts of clear thought and plain , incisive speech . Col Dodge writes on a much larger scale and addresses a totally different audience . While narrowing his field to military affairs , he expands his detail so considerably that , though his work is eight times longer than Mr Johnston 's , he only reaches the Peace of Tilsit at the close of his second volume .
