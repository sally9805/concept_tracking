txt Taft and Tact . My compliments to Secretary of War Taft . May I be permitted to remark to that gentleman that tact has been aptly described as the microscope of discretion ? Tact , Mr. Taft , is that feathery touch which turns instinctively from everything , however trifling , which can needlessly wound the sensibilities of another , or recoil with pain upon ourselves . The very opposite to this , Mr. Taft , is often the case with men of large capacities , who use the telescope and not the microscope ; and who , while they are employed in wandering among the stars , knock themselves against everything which is on a level with their heads . These giants in intellect sometimes , it must be owned , Mr. Taft , trample without knowing it upon many of the decencies of human life and spoil much on which its beauty and sympathy depend . Truly may it be said that " ' the tender mercies of the tactless are cruel . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
