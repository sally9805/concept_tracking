 | AN occurrence of tremendous and far-reaching importance is the success of the United States Steel Corporation 's wage-earners ' investment and profit-sharing plan . WThen this plan was announced , January 1 , every thoughtful man in the country gave it close attention . Here was an experiment which any one could see drove straight at the roots of the interwoven problems which have been brought acutely to the front by the development of modern industrialism in America , ? the problems of actual ownership of the great industrial corporations , of the relations of such corporations to the predominant opinion of society and therefore to the lawmaking power , of the relations of labor and capital , and the bearing of all these upon the rise of socialism . The deep significance of the experiment all could understand , though of course some minds had a truer appreciation of it than others . With all , the question of questions was , Will it succeed ? To many lips came the expression : . , It is a clever , an artistic , an ingeniously contrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage-earners take hold of it in earnest ? I s it anything more than a delightful dream ? " We have not been compelled to wait long for the answer . The directors of the Steel Corporation offered 25,000 shares of stock to their 168,000 employees . The books were to be kept open thirty days . No one dared believe that within this month , while the plan was so new , while all sorts of prejudices or fears might deter subscribers , and while the great mass of employees would still be studying and thinking about the offer which to them must have seemed somewhat novel and complicated , all or even one-half of the proffered stock would be taken up . Yet , when the books closed Saturday evening , January 31 , it was found that the 25,000 shares offered had been subscribed for more than twice over . Twenty-seven thousand six hundred and thirty-three employees had subscribed for 51,125 shares . This was success , ? success complete and surprising . Almost exactly one-sixth of the vast army of employees of the corporation had declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company for which they work . Best of all . the very men who , it had been feared , would not take kindly to the project , ? the men who stand bare-bodied in front of the furnace-fires , or like magicians handle the glowing rails or bars of molten metal , or delve in the gloomy mines . or watch the myriads of machines , or keep the books in the offices ? have most eagerly responded to the company 's offer . Those who thought that the real workingman , the man who works with his hands for daily or weekly wages , would not participate in this plan , must be agreeably disappointed by the returns . Look at the facts : Fifty per cent of all the subscribers ( 14,260 men ) , taking nearly 60 per cent . ( 29,013 ) of all the shares subscribed for , belong to Class E , which is composed of men who receive salaries of between $800 and $2,500 a year each . Forty-four per cent . of all the subscribers ( 12 , - 170 men ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the shares subscribed for , belong to Class F , which is composed of men who receive salaries of less than $800 a year each . Ninety-four per cent . of the subscribers earn from $2,500 a year downward , and their subscriptions amount to nearly 90 per cent . of the total . Only six per cent . of the subscribers , taking only about 1 0 per cent . of the shares . belong to the classes of employees in which may be found managers , superintendents , and the higher-salaried officials of the company . These men wanted many more shares , but , under the limitation set , were unable to get them . When the directors of the corporation met early in February to receive the reports of the success or failure of their project , they found themselves embarrassed by the opulence , not annoyed by the meagerness , of the results . Gratified beyond measure , they voted to allot a total of about forty-five thousand shares among the subscribers . The 12,170 men from the lower ranks of the army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribed for ; the 14,260 men in the class just above them were allotted 90 per cent . of their subscriptions . The higher classes , D , B , C , and A , composed of largesalaried officials , had their subscriptions , aggregating about 7,000 shares , scaled to 80. to 70 , to 60 , and 50 per cent. , respectively . Every man who subscribed got at least one share of stock . Nearly one-sixth of all the employees of the Steel Corporation have thus become purchasers of the preferred stock of the company . to the extent of $0,500,000 par value . Of this suns. $4,000,000 is taken by employees whose earnings range from $500 or $600 a year upward to $2.500.  | If such a result as this can be attained at the first trial , within a single month , ? if the restraint of prejudice and of lack of acquaintance with a new project can be overcome to so great an extent in so short a time , ? thoughtful men are asking , What may not be done in the future ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single corporation ? And as applied to all great industrial corporations ? If *-t.500 . ( ) ( H ) of good dividend-paying securities may be disposed of to the actual workers for one corporation in one month , is it not possible to dispose of hundreds of millions of such safe and standard securities to the employees of hundreds of industrial corporations in the course of a year ? And if this can be done , ? if ownership of our great industrial combinations can be spread out among the men who work for them , if aggregations of capital may thus be democraticized , or what Federal Judge Grosscup called the other day " peopleized , " ? are we not finding herein a natural and easy solution of the industrial , political , and social problem which to many keen eyes appear to be rising like a cloud above the national horizon ? Nothing succeeds like success . Now that the employees ' investment and profit-sharing plan of the United States Steel Corporation has so quickly demonstrated what may be done , men are everywhere saying that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an enormous extension of the principle throughout the country . It has long been a cause of wonderment to many observers that so few of what is called the working or the wage-earning class in this country put their savings - directly into the stocks or bonds of transportation or manufacturing corporations . As a rule , the men who work for wages never think of buying a share of stock or a bond . They do not know how to go about it . The idea is wholly foreign to their philosophy . In their minds , stocks and bonds are associated with large accumulations of capital , with Wall Street , with speculation , with the world of finance , which is not their world , and which they would be foolish to try to enter . The facilities for buying one or two shares of stock or one or two hundred dollars ' worth of bonds are not within the reach of the average workman , ? or he thinks they are not , which amounts to the same thing . It is the almost invariable rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate , ? homes for themselves , and occasionally an extra building lot or two , ? in life insurance , or in savings-banks or building associations . In the United States , nearly seven million depositors have in the savings-banks the vast sum of 2,800,000,000 . Probably twothirds of these deposits are in the name of wageearners . The average interest-increment upon these enormous savings is small , ? two or three per cent . a year . If the wage-earners could be induced to put their money into industrial securities , and the experience of the Steel Corporation shows that they can be , ? it is not easy for the mind to grasp the ultimate possibilities of the ensuing popular ownership of great corporations . Once the movement is started , once wage-earners learn the modus operandi of buying such securities and discover that they can net a much higher rate of interest for the use of their money , the aggregate amount of their yearly investment may reach surprising figures . The change can not some at once , as by a sudden inspiration or quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about gradually . Indispensable conditions are : 1 . Facilities for buying stock should be offered by the managers of the corporations , so that the business of selling such securities shall not fall into the hands of brokers who might prey upon investors by " working off " upon them paper of doubtful value . 2 . The stock offered employees must be firstclass , safe , of assured permanent value and dividend-earning power . 3 . The operations of the corporations . in great detail and perfect frankness , should be placed yearly before the public , after the manner now observed by the life insurance companies , most of the railway companies , and a few of the industrial companies , the Steel Corporation itself being a conspicuous example of the last-named class . 4 . Offerings of stock should be made to employees by all high-class corporations , not benevolently , not with any altruistic or sentimental notions , but purely as a matter of business . The standard of self-respect and of pride and dignity is quite as high among the wage-earners as among people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resent , and view with a most natural and proper suspicion , any effort to " do something for them " or help them along . " They do not want charity , but a chance to invest their savings prudently and advantageously , as business or professional men invest their surplus . 5 . Credit should be granted , with the stock as security for deferred payments , on a purely business basis , just as the credit principle is applied to so many of the other activities of business . 6 . Corporations should offer their own stock upon equitable terms , thus making their em- ployees joint owners with other stockholders of the properties they serve , attaching them to the company with the bonds of self-interest . 7 . Profit-sharing could well be associated with stock-investment , the latter affording a most excellent basis for the former . upon the principle that the thrifty and careful man who works well and saves his money and invests his surplus in the securities of the concern is a more valuable employee than the one who does not do these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wages and his dividends . Profit-sharing can thus be made a method of increasing wages to those who are most worthy of it and who give the best service to their employers . The success of the Steel C'orporation 's experiment has shown that no good reason exists why the sterling stocks of the country should not be largely placed in the bands of the people . It is true that under present conditions wage-earners do indirectly invest their savings in industrial securities . They put their money in the savings or other banks , or in the life insurance companies , and these companies in turn buy and hold vast sums of bonds and stocks of various sorts . It is tree , in this sense , that all the great railway and steamship , insurance and manufacturing , corporations . some of which are known as - trusts , " are owned by the people at large , by hundreds of thousands and millions of stockholders , and not by a few- rich men , as is generally supposed . But this is quite a different thing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depositors in savings-banks or holders of policies in insurance companies as a rule know or care nothing about the ultimate investment of their deposits or premiums . They look only to the bank or to the insurance company . They have not the slightest sense of proprietorship or of personal interest in the corporations whose securities may be in the vaults of the insurance company or bank . The moral effect of direct ownership and direct and distinct personal interest is entirely lost . The corporation whose securities lie in the vaults of his savings-bank or insurance company is to the depositor or policy-holder a distant , shadowy , perhaps unknown entity . But the corporation whose stock or bond he has in his bureau drawer , or deposited for safekeeping elsewhere , which he has partly or wholly paid for with his own hands out of his hard-earned savings . and the dividend which he and his family reckon upon as a part of their income , becomes to him a living reality , a part of his life and hope . If it chances to be ? as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working day after ( lay and year after year . if he feels as he toils that he is a part owner of the establishment and has a stake in its success and prosperity , then we are reaching the best possible substitute for the abolition ' of small individual ownership which modern industrial development has decreed . We are doing quite as much for the corporations as for the wage-earner who has thus become a joint proprietor in his small way . W e are attaining a condition which will reconcile the masses of the people to the existence of giant corporations , if anything can reconcile them , and while we are doing something for the wage-earning investor and profitsharer and the corporation which has taken hi In in and given him a stake in the company . we are also doing very much for society and govermnent and for the wholesome regulation of public opinion . It needs no vivid imagination to follow out the possible and probable social and political effects . It has been the pride of Americans that we have no classes in our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No greater misfortune could happen than class development . Nor could that misfortune assume more sinister form than in the upbuilding of a small class of corporation owners and managers who remain distinct and apart from the great mass of the people , ? a condition in which the vast majority would be naturally imbued with a spirit of antagonism to the little minority who controlled employment , production , arid , to some extent , at least . the prices of commodities , this antagonism becoming acute and perhaps threatening under special circumstances . It may be said , with much truth , that there is little real danger of such development in a country like ours , where public opinion is still in such wholesome state , and where , in the absence of true classes . society is in a condition of flux and of sym = pathy and interchange from the very top almost to the very bottom . And yet , during the past few years we have seen the rise of the anti-trust spirit , in some minds assuming a virulent phase we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth ; we have seen , ? at least , those who have cared to look beneath the surface have seen. ? a considerable though not as yet alarming growth of socialism . A recent episode at Washington , wherein the mere name of the head of a great monopolistic trust signed to a telegram created a furore front one end of ' the country to the other , served to indicate a tendency of the public wind which prudent men will take into consideration in their reckonings for the future . Clearly , there could be no better means of strengthening our social and political system  | and warding off whatever danger this tendency may present than lw diffusion of the ownership of public corporations throughout the warp and woof of society . The remarkable young lousiness man who designed the Steel Corporation 's plan and was aided by a broad-minded and far . sighted board of directors in putting it into operation fully understood the philosophy of this question . Mr. George AV . Perkins had come to this understanding through a good school . All his life he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a decided advantage over many of his New York contemporaries , for he had mingled with the people of the great West , among whom the present and future of America are best studied . All his life , too , he had been managing men . As one of the active forces of a groat life insurance company , he had been engaged in strenuous competition for business . He soon discovered that a successful fight for business means something more than having so many agency managers , sub-managers , and solicitors . It means that the spirit of enthusiasm must 1ae breathed into the men ; that they must be made to feel that the interests of the company are truly their interests ; that their stake in the general success is as great as that of the heavy shareholders ; that they all belong to a happy and sympathetic family , in which there is a sure and ample reward for faithfulness and efficiency ; that there is more in the work for them than the usual commissions and salaries ; and that once they demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversity and provide for their dependents should they fall by the wayside . Though it would be most interesting and instructive to describe in detail the profit-sharing method by which the life insurance company in question worked out this problem , it must suffice here to say that the success achieved was unmistakable and far-reaching . The men seemed transformed . They were imbued with a new spirit . They came to look upon the affairs of the company as .. ours . " not , . theirs . " They talked of what " we " were doing and hoped to do . In short . they were hound to the corporation by new ties , stronger and closer than any that had theretofore existed . In an incredil , ly short time , the company found itself in possession of an agency system which was the envy of all its rivals . Competitors attempted to cut in and lead away some of these men , ? these more strenuous , more efficient , more successful workers , ? but without avail . Liberal offers of larger commissions and higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too content , to be broken up . Not a man succumbed to temptation ; and to - day the company is getting its full share of business at less proportionate cost than any of its rivals , and with the tremendous satisfaction of knowing that it has a staff full of loyalty and determination which may be depended upon at all times and in any emergency . This success of the life insurance manager who knows men and had made it his life-study to win their confidence and get from them the best of which they were capable was the forerunner of the Steel Corporation 's plan . Mr. Perkins believed human nature was much the same in the steel business as he had found it in the insurance business . He believes now that the managers of other corporations will find it about the same everywhere , no matter in what part of the industrial field they may be operating . In devising his plan of the Steel Corporation , Mr. Perkins had in mind this central idea : The chief danger threatening a vast corporation whose work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of individual interest . It is the danger of heaviness and inertia , of ruts and stagnation . Men must be stimulated to individual initiative and greater efficiency . The way must be found to bind them to the corporation with stronger ties than those of mere salary ? or wage-earning . Men must have a stake in the success of the company higher and better than a simple desire to hold their places . We must make a great democracy of this business , not an autocracy , nor even an oligarchy . We need the warm interest and hearty cooperation of every employee , from the president down to the boy who drives a mule in a Lake Superior iron mine . How to weld this army together and put esprit du corps into its ranks , was the problem . The solution decided upon , and now tested with such gratifying results , will probably serve as a model for many other corporations . It is not supposed to be a perfect plan , and in its details it may not be adaptable to all corporations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetrical and harmonious . Henry C. Frick . H. IL Rogers , P. A. B. Widener , Norman B. Ream , Robert Bacon , Albert H. Gary , and N r . Perkins , the members of the Finance Committee , saw at once that their plan must be divided into two main branches . One was to interest a large number of employees by inducing them to become permanent stockholders . The other was to engage the services of presidents , officers . managers , and superintendents , and all others charged with responsibility . on a profit-sharing basis . It was early perceived that at the present time it would not be practicable to apply profit-sharing directly to the great number of  | men who work with their hands throughout all the ramifications of the corporation 's activities . But profit-sharing was indirectly included in the offer made to these employees , and of which such a large number have already availed themselves . In other words , the company 's proposal was to share profits with all employees who would demonstrate their interest and thrift by buying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock set aside for purchase by employees was offered to the men who earn the smallest salaries . This was done by dividing the 168,000 employees into six classes , according to their salaries ? Class A , over $20,000 a year ; Class B , $10,000 to $20,000 , down to Class E , $800 to $2,500 a year , and Class F. under $800 a year ? and then by limiting the amount of stock employees could take to the following proportions of their annual salaries : Class A. 5 per cent . ; Class B , 8 per cent. ; Class C , 10 per cent . ; Class D , 12 per cent. ; Class E , 15 per cent. ; and Class F , 20 per cent . It will thus be seen why 90 per cent . of all the stock subscribed for in January goes to the two classes of mechanics and workmen whose salaries are under $2,500 a year . The method is really a very simple one . Employees subscribe for stock , one or two shares apiece . The shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each employee pays in monthly installments , taken from his wages , and he may have the payments made small or large , as he likes , save that not more than 25 per cent . of his wages may be so used in any month , and he may not be more than three years in completing payment . Dividends at the rate of i per cent . a year go to the subscriber from the date of his first payment . Interest at 5 per cent . is charged on the deferred payments . In other words , the corporation sells stock below the market price , on credit , and pays the holder 2 per cent . a year in dividends more than he has to pay in interest . Here is a direct inducement to the investment of savings . But this is not all . Inducements are offered the employee to complete payment for his stock and to hold it . As soon as he has fully paid for it . the certificate is issued in his name , and he is free to dispose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it and at the same time keep his place as a working partner in the company 's service , the corporation says to him : " If you hold your stock , and beginning with January next year you show it to the treasurer of your company , and present a letter from the proper official that during the preceding year you have been in the employ of the company , and have shown a proper interest in its welfare and progress , and you do this each January for five years . we will give you , in addition to the dividends paid you , a bonus of five dollars per share for each year . During the second period of five years , we will pay you a further yearly bonus . as a reward for your continuous faithful service . " The amount of the second bonus can not now be fixed , but it will doubtless be larger than the first one . Ample provision is made for the protection of subscribers who from one cause or another are unable to complete payment . Subscribers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the 7 per cent . dividends and the 5 per cent . interest . In the case of subscribers who die or are disabled while faithfully serving the corporation , after having paid for their stock , the five dollars per share yearly bonus is not lost , but is paid over to them or to their estates . It would be worth the while of any reader of the REVIEW of REVIEWS to sit down and figure out the profits of a rolling-mill worker who subscribed for , say , two shares of stock and undertook to pay for them in one year . The shares would cost him $165 . His monthly payments would be $13.75 . Five per cent . interest on these deferred payments would be about $3.75 . At the end of the year he would own his stock outright , and get the $14 in dividends , or $10.25 over the interest . If he remained in the service of the company for five years . he would in that period draw in dividends $06.23 , and $50 in yearly bonuses of $5 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be $165 ; total income . $11.6.25 . And he would then have , as his own , free of all charges , an investment bringing him perpetually $14 a year , and at least $24 a year as long as he remained in the service of the Steel Corporation . It is the announced intention of the corporation to make another offer of stock next year , and the outlook is that the shares will be subscribed for many times over . The broad-viewed men who are guiding the destinies of this , the greatest corporation in the world , have caught the spirit of the democratization or " peopleizing " of our industrial combinations . At the present time , there are about ninety thousand holders of Steel Corporation shares . It is probably safe to predict that within five years there will be a quarter of a million stockholders . Ultimately . the great bulk of these securities will be diffused among the people . One of the directors of the Steel Corporation , in speaking of the programme to secure popular or widely distributed ownership of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of workmen and peasant farmers are owners of the stock of the Credit Foncier , Credit  | Lyonnais , and other banking and industrial corporations . " There is a widely prevalent impression , " he added , . ' that the bulk of the Steel Corporation shares are owned by Mr. Morgan and a coterie of men about him . This is not true . Mr. Morgan 's relations to the reorganization of the steel properties have never been properly understood . Let us assume , for the sake of a simple explanation , that two or three years ago the managers of the various steel companies had gone to Washington and asked the Government to take over their properties for the sake of conserving industrial prosperity . Assume , also , that the Government had accepted the trust , and that Congress had authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue bonds to pay for the properties . In such a case there would be no question that the people of the United States owned the steel plants . The title would be in their name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is precisely in this light that we of the United States Steel Corporation look upon the relations of the company to the people . It is their property , they have made it what it is , and they should have possession of it through diffusion among them of the stock certificates which represent its ownership . Mr. Morgan 's relation to the transaction has been precisely the same as would have been that of the Secretary of the Treasury in the impossible case we have supposed of direct popular purchase through government agency . " The second or direct profit-sharing part of the Steel Corporation plan is also based upon the principle of democracy . When the various companies were merged into one gigantic corporation , the subsidiary concerns were managed , usually , by men who had a very large personal pecuniary interest in them , and who gave to the affairs of the companies not only their time , but the best efforts of which they were capable . In devising this plan , the aim was to maintain the same important incentive , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to distribute its effect throughout the corporation that every man would feel he had again become a ION POINTS THE WA Y. 331 partner and would work from that point of view . In other words . the purpose is to stimulate individual initiative and to overcome that tendency to inertia and stagnation which many have feared may ultimately work the destruction of such vast organizations . The company proposes to distribute among its responsible men 1 per cent . of the net earnings if the net earnings during the present year shall exceed $80. - 000,000 and be less than $90,000,000 , and to increase the sum distributed one-fifth of one per cent . for every ten million dollars added to the net earnings . If during this year , as is not unlikely , the not earnings reach the total of $140 , - 000,000 , the sum distributed among the men who have helped make that great success will be $3,150,000 . This is profit-sharing on a great scale . The corporation reserves the right to make the distribution according to the judgment of the Finance Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the present time , there are in the employ of the Steel Corporation and its subsidiary companies approximately 1,750 men who receive salaries in excess of i ' 1,500 a year , divided as follows : Twelve with salaries of $20,000 a year and over , including the $100,000 salary of the president of the corporation itself . Fifty from $10,000 to $20,000 a year . Two hundred from $5,000 to $10,000 a year . Fifteen hundred from $2,500 to $5,000 a year . By giving its employees opportunity . and inducement to save their earnings and invest them in the shares of the company , by making even the humblest workman an indirect participant in the profits of the concern for which he works , by setting aside a share of the profits for annual distribution among the men whose skill and judgment , whose yes or no. enter so largely into the economies and successes or failures of the giant organization . and by taking the public into confidence through full and frank reports of all operations , the United States Steel Corporation has pointed out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad to follow .
