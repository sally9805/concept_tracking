txt Apropos of book collecting in general , we wonder if-it has ever occurred to any one what an interesting collection could be made of books containing inscriptions , . books of no special value in themselves , and containing names usually quite unknown to fame ? It has long been a custom of a friend of our own to secure such books whenever discovered on the shelves of second-hand book shops . A later issue of the 1S42 Tennyson  --  for instance , in two volumes  --  contains elaborate inscriptions " To Tillie , " both the skill of the artist and of the penman being united in a really artistic representation of an old tree , among its roots being the words " To Tillie , " and on the opposite side " From her friend J. S. " Naturally one wonders who Tillie was and why a book once so cherished , for the volume shows signs of frequent reading , and contains many marked passages , should have passed out of her possession . Perhaps Tillie is dead ! That Would be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No ; in that case the book would have been destroyed , or , at least had such pages torn , or if sold because of other considerations , the pages would have lacked the neatly cut out strip so often found missing from the title page of a honk , and In the ease of a rare edition , so often taking from its money value . The same friend has twenty or thirty volumes , which were picked up over a space of have a dozen years , in various book shops all over the country . books bearing the names " Belle S ? . " pith addresses in various parts of town in Winter , and good country addresses in Summer . The young woman read the best of books  --  and as soon as they came out , apparently , because many of her treasured volumes are now among their present owner 's first editions . Another recent find was contained in a three-volume edition of " Lorna Doone . " Some former owner had made the most exquisitely designed and executed hair flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back " Father 's and Mother 's hair . " and other inscriptions were on other disks , all so carefully and delicately done as to show the value set upon them by their owner . And yet they ? in the end  --  were found In old books ! After keeping them for a while , the finder destroyed these records , feeling they were too precious to become the property of careless owners , There is a strange pleasure in guessing at the char:I.:ler of former owners by their way of writing in or otherwise treating the volumes . We found great Interest in disc .. iveting in a recent purchase the name of a well-knows , Collector and writer , and at the back of the volume the date of its purchase , and the price laid for it . A copy of a somewhat rare Stevenson , containing a well- known writer 's inscription to his mother , finds new interest from the fact that such inscription was written shortly after the two authors had met , and as we know from Stevenson himself , fancied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend 's collection are several containing the bookplate of a once %keit-known New York physician , the date of purchase , the place , and the price pail , as will as a full bibliography of the author 's entire works , all written in on the fly-leaves , in a delicately minute , and yet perfectly legible , hand ; which much have cost the previous owner an infinite amount of trouble . The books above referred to are all com- paratively Modern issues , but the pleasure may be said to be enhanced when inscriptions in contemporary hands are found on the blank pages ' of old books , or on that favorite . of all favorite places , the title , and particularly if such title happens to be am engraved one . Perhaps such inscription may only be " John Smith : His Book , " but more often it is fuller  --  perhaps even conveying an appreciation of the volume , or some suggestion that the author 's work is not to his taste . Whatever the nature of the inscription , it adds much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to who the former owner may have been , the conditions under which he lived and moved and had his being , until sometimes it would almost seem the books were sufficiently alive to tell us of the changes through , which they have finally passed into our own hands . We have not touched upon the great interest attaching to old books which have once belonged to well-known people , because such volumes are valued by all the world . How much , too , may a nook 's value be enhanced by the mere fact that it was a presentation copy , given by one well-known Poet to another . One such we know of , a copy of the pretty little vellum " A Poet 's Harvest Home , " v hich its author , William Bell Scott , presented to Christina Rossetti , with a pretty autograph . nscription . What visionsNof these two poets does not such conjunction of names bring before us . And the fact that the condition of the white vellum cover does not indicate too great care , reminds us how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her somewhat feeble health , her books did not receive the care she thought they deserved . And so we might go on indefinitely upon a subject which Andrew Lang and Austin Dobson have t-oth written upon in charming fashion , and which has been promised us in amplified form in " Inscriptions in Books . " which a well-known London writer is said to have in preparation .
