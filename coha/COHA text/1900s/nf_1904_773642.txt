txt // Dalton fiat measured the pressure of aqueous vapor for temperatures between 0 ? and 100 ? by means of the apparatus represented in fig. 151 . Two barometer-tubes , A and B , are filled with mercury , and inverted in an iron bath full of mercury , and placed over a furnace or large Bunsen burner . The tube A is an ordinary barometer-tube ; but into the tube B is introduced a small quantity of water . The tubes are supported in a clindrical vessel full of water , the temperature of which is indicated by the thermometer , t . The bath being gradually heated , the water in the cylinder becomes heated too ; the water which is in the tube B vaporizes , and , in proportion as its vapor pressure increases , the mercury sinks . The depressions of the mercury corresponding to each degree of the thermometer are read off on the scale . Thus if , when the thermometer is at 70 ? , the mercury is 233 millimeteres lower in the tube B than in the tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aqueous vapor is 233 millimetres ; which amounts to saying that it exercises on the sides of the vessel which contains it a pressure equal to that due to a column of mercury 233 millimetres in height . Dulong and Arago determined the pressure of aqueous vapor above 100 ? up to pressures of 24 atmospheres . More recently Regnault measured the pressure of aqueous vapor both above and below 100 ? . For temperatures below 100 ? he used two independent methods . Of these one was a modification of Dalton 's ; the other depends on the principle that when a liquid boils the pressure of the vapor is equal to the pressure the liquid supports . If therefore the emperature and the corresponding pressure are known , the question is solved , and the method merely consists in causing water to boil under a given pressure and in measuring the correB'O1t , I // sponding temperature . The method is applicable to pressures greater than atmospheric , . The following table is due to Regnault. 229 . MEASUREMENT OF HEIGHTS BY THE BOILING-POINT. ? From the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heights of mountains may be measured by the thermometer instead of by the barometer , since the pressure of the steam of boiling water is equal to that of the superincumbent atmosphere , whatever the temperature may be at which the water is boiling . Suppose , for example , it is found that water boils on the summit of a mountain at 90 ? , and at its base at 98 ? ; at these temperatures pressure of the vapor is equal to that of the pressure on the liquid ? that is , to the pressure of the atmosphere at the two places respectively . Now , the pressure of aqueous vapor at various temperatures has been determined , and accordingly the pressures corresponding to the above temperatures are sought in the tables . These numbers represent the atmospheric pressures at the two places ? in other words , they give the barometric heights ? and from these the height of the mountain may be calculated . An ascent of about 1,080 feet produces a lowering of 1 ? C. in the boiling-point , or , what is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowering of 1 ? F. 230 . LATENT HEAT OF VAPOR. ? In speaking of ebullition we have seen that , from the moment a liquid begins to boil , its temperature ceases to rise whatever be the intensity of the source of heat . It follows that a considerable quantity of heat becomes absorbed in ebullition , the only effect of which is to transform NA'I'UItAL PHILOSOPHY the body from the liquid to the gaseous condition . And , conversely , when a saturated vapor passes into the state of liquid , it fives out that amount of heat which it had absorbed in becoming converted into vapor . This may be illustrated by means of the apparatus represented in fig. 152 . The vessel c contains a certain weight of water at a known temperature , as indicated by a thermometer not shown in the figure ; in the vessel a water is raised to the boiling-point , and when this is attained the open end of the pipe is dipped in c , and the boiling continued for some time . The increase in weight in c is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the thermometer shows a rise of temperature From these data . the quantity of heat given out by the steam in condensing may be calculated . Thus , for instance , suppose the original weight of water in c to have been 1,000 grammes and its temperature 10 ? , while at the end of the experiment it was 20 ? , and that the water distilled over and condensed weighed 16.3 grammes ; then the quantity of heat which has been imparted to the cooling water has been 1,000 ( 20 - 10 ) =1,000 X 10 =10,000 thermal units , and this has been effected by the heat produced by . the condensation of 16.3 grammes of steam at 100 ? to water at the same temperature , together with that which it has given out in cooling down to 20 ? . This latter is represented by the expression 16.3 x H- ( 100 - 20 ) = 16.3 ( x + 80 ) , where x is the latent heat of vaporization . By equating the two expressions the value of x is easily found ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed by Black , who described them by saying that during vaporization a quantity of sensible heat became latent , and that the latent heat again became free during condensation . The quantity of heat which a liquid must absorb in passing from the liquid to the gaseous state , and which it gives out in passing from the state of vapor to that of liquid , is spoken of as the latent of vaporization . The analogy of these phenomena to those of fusion will he at once seen . The modes of determining are described in principle in the above example ; we may give the following results which // have been obtained for the latent heats of vaporation of a few liquids : The meaning of these numbers is ? in the of water , for instance ? that it requires as much heat to convert n pound of water from the state of liquid , at the boiling- ; , Dint , to that , .. f vapor at the same temperature , as would raise a ! stolid of water through 540 degrees , or 540 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat yielded by the conversion et ' one pound of vapor of alcohol at 78 ? into liquid alcohol of the . , unit temperature would raise 208 pounds of water through one degree . It has been assumed that the boiling is under the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere ; if the pressure is lower , and therefore the boiling-point lower , the value for the latent heat is greater . Watt supposed that the sum of the latent and sensible heats was a constant quantity , and equal to 640 ; thus , if water were boiled at 90 ? , its latent heat on this view would be 550 . This is not , however , the case ; Regnault showed that the total heat of vaporization is expressed by a constant number , 606.5 , added to the product of 0.305 into the temperature of boiling on the Centigrade scale . 231 . COLD DUE TO Evaporation. ? Whatever , then , be the temperature at which a vapor is produced , an absorption of heat always takes place . If , therefore , a liquid evaporates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat equal to that which is expended in producing the vapor , its temperature sinks , and the cooling is greater in proportion as the evaporation is more rapid . This may become a source of very great cooling . Thu , , if a few drops of ether be placed on the hand , and t h i s bo agitated to accelerate the evaporation , great cold is experienced . By delivering the ether in the form of spray , the cold produced is still greater , and on this depends the method of obtaining local anesthesia . With liquids which are less volatile than ether , like alcohol and water , the same phenomenon is produced , but the cooling is less marked . On coming out of a bath , and more especially in the open air and with some wind , a very sharp cold is experienced , due to the evaporation of the water on the surface of the body . The wearing of moist linen is cold and dangerous , because it withdraws from the body the heat which the moisture requires for conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or draught does not necessarily arise from the wind being cooler , for it may , as shown NATURAL PHILOSOPHY the thermometer , be actually warmer than the surface of the skin , but arises from the rapid evaporation it causes . We have the feeling of oppression , even at moderate temperatures , when we are in an atmosphere saturated by moisture in which no evaporation takes place . The cooling produced by the use of fans is due to the increased evaporation they cause . The freshness occasioned by watering the streets is also an effect of evaporation . The fresh feeling experienced after a shower on a hot summer 's day is due not only to the lower temperature of the rain from the higher regions of the atmosphere , but in greater measure to the heat absorbed owing to the rapid evaporation . The cold produced by evaporation is used in hot climates to cool water by means of alcarrazas . These are porous earthen vessels , through which water percolates , so that on the outside there is a continual evaporation , which is accelerated when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the same reason wine is cooled by wrapping the bottles in wet cloths and placing them in a draught . The high temperatures which the body can sustain in Turkish baths ? exceeding even the temperature of boiling water ? are only possible by the rapid evaporation which sets in. 232 . WATER AND MERCURY FROZEN IN A VACUUM , ? From the great quantity of heat which disappears whenever a liquid is converted into vapor , it will be seen that by accelerating the evaporation we have a means of producing cold . We have found that liquids vaporize more rapidly the lower the pressure . Hence , if a vessel containing water be placed in a space from which the air is exhausted , it should cool very rapidly . Leslie succeeded in freezing water by means of its own rapid evaporation . Tinder the receiver of the air-pump is placed a vessel containing strong sulphuric acid , a substance which has a great affinity for water , and above it a thin , shallow , porous capsule , A ( fig. 153 ) , containing a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to boil , and , since the vapors are absorbed by the sulphuric acid as fast as they are formed , a rapid evaporation is produced , which quickly effects the freezing of the water . By using liquids more volatile than water , more particularly liquid sulphurous acid , which boils at ? 10 ? , a degree of cold // is obtained sufficiently intense to freeze mercury . The experiment may be made by covering the bulb of it thermometer with cotton wool , and , after having moistened it with liquid sulphurous acid , placing it under the receiver of the air-pump . When the pressure is reduced the mercury is quickly frozen . By passing a current , of air , previously ( tooled , through liquid methyl chloride , temperatures of from ? 2:1 " to 70 " ( 1 . may be maintained with great constancy for several hours . Thilorier , by directing a , jet of liquid carbonic . acid on the bulb of an alcohol thermometer , obtained a temperature of- 100 degree without freezing the alcohol . With a mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ether , Despretz obtained a sufficient degree of cold to reduce alcohol to the viscous stale . By means of the evaporation of bisulphide of carbon I ho formation of ice may be illustrated ( fig. 154 ) without the aid of an air-pump . A little water is dropped on a small piece of wood , B , and a capsule of thin copper foil , C , containing bisulphide of carbon , is placed on the water . The evaporation of the bisulphide is accelerated by means of a pair N of bellows , N , and after a few minutes the water freezes round the capsule , so that the latter adheres to the wood . In like manner , if some water be placed in a test-tube , which is then dipped in a glass containing some ether , and a current of air be blown through the ether by means of a glass tube fitted to the nozzle of a pair of bellows , the rapid evaporation of the ether very soon freezes the water in the tube . In . Harrison 's method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air-pump which produces a rapid evaporation of some ether , m which is immersed the vessel containing the water to be frozen . The apparatus is so constructed that the vaporized ether can be condensed and used again . In the East Indies ice is formed even at a temperature of 8 ? to 10 ? C. provided the nights are clear and bright . Water is exposed in flat porous vessels , which are placed in shallow pits lined with bad conductors , such as straw . The water percolates through the porous vessel , and there evaporating , withdraws so much heat from the vessel , and from the rest of the water , that it freezes . This process is favored by the absence of aqueous vapor from the atmosphere ; for aqueous vapor has a great absorptive power for the obscure heat radiated from the earth , and thus obstructs it in its attempt to escape . IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY CHAPTER VIII . LIQUEFACTION OF VAPORS AND GASES . 233 . LIQUEFACTION OF VAPORS. ? The liquefaction or condensation of vapors is their passage from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three causes ? cooling , compression , or chemical affinity . When vapors are condensed , their latent heat becomes free  - -  that is , it affects the thermometer . This is readily seen when a current of steam at 100 ? is passed into a vessel of water at the ordinary temperature . The liquid becomes rapidly heated , and soon reaches 100 ? . The quantity of heat given up in liquefaction is equal to the quantity absorbed in vaporization . Liquefaction by chemical affinity. ? The affinity of certain substances for water is so great as to condense the vapors in the atmosphere , even when they are far from their point of saturation . Thus , when highly hygroscopic substances , such as quicklime , caustic potash , or sulphuric acid , are exposed in the air , they always absorb aqueous vapor . Certain varieties of common salt , exposed to the air , absorb and condense so much aqueous vapor as to become liquid . Many other salts , such as calcium chloride and sodium nitrate , have the same property , and are hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose a vessel containing aqueous vapor ? a cylinder , for instance ? and in this cylinder a piston which can be depressed at will . When the piston is depressed , the vapor behaves like a true gas , as it is not at first in a state of saturation , the pressure increasing its elastic force and density without liquefying it . But the more the piston is depressed , the smaller does the volume of the vapor become , and a point is ultimately reached at which the vapor present is just sufficient to saturate the space . From this point the slightest increase of pressure causes a portion of vapor to pass into the liquid state , and if the piston descends to the bottom of the cylinder all the vapor is condensed . In this experiment it is to be observed that when once saturation is attained , provided there is no air in the cylinder , the resistance to the depression of the // piston does not increase in proportion as it descends , because , the vapor being saturated , its pressure does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as pressure , only causes vapors to liquefy when they are in It state of saturation . But when once a given space is saturated , the slightest lowering of temperature takes from the vapors the leaf which gives them their condition , the attract ion between the molecule preponderates , they agglomerate , forming extremely small droplets , Odell float in the air and are deposited on the surrounding bodies . Vapors are ordinarily condensed by cooling . Thus the vapors exhaled from the noses and mouths of animals first saturate the colder air in which they are disengaged , and they then condense with a cloud-like appearance . Owing to the same phenomenon the vapors become visible which are disengaged from boiling water , those which rise from chimneys , the fogs formed above rivers , and so forth . All these vapors appear more distinctly in winter than in summer , for then the air is colder , and the condensation is more complete . In cold weather , the windows in heated rooms are seen to become covered with dew on the inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being saturated with vapor , but the layers of air in immediate contact with the windows become colder ; and as the quantity of vapor necessary to saturate a given space is less the colder the space , a moment is reached at which the air in contact with the windows is saturated , and then the vapor it contains is deposited . In a time of thaw , when the air is hotter on the outside than on the inside , the deposit is formed on the outside . To the same cause is due the deposit of moisture formed on walls , which is expressed by saying that they sweat ? an unsuitable expression , for the moisture does not come from the walls , but from the atmosphere . The walls are colder than the air , and they lower the temperature of the layers in contact with them , and condense the aqueous vapor . A similar effect is produced when in summer a bottle of wine is brought from the cellar , or when a glass is filled with cold water : a deposit of dew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same phenomenon does not occur so often in winter , for then the temperature of the atmosphere being frequently the same as that of the bottle , or even lower , the layers of air in immediate contact with it are not cooled . 234 . HEAT DISENGAGED DURING CONDENSATION. ? It has been seen that any liquid in vaporizing absorbs a quantity of heat . This heat is not destroyed , for in the converse change it reappears in NATURAL PHILOSOPHY the sensible state ? that is to say , it is capable of acting on our of feeling and on the thermometer . For instance , we know a pound of water absorbs in vaporizing 540 units of heat t is to say , a quantity of heat necessary to raise 540 pounds of water from 0 ? to 10 : conversely , a pound of steam at 100 ? , which is liquefied and gives a pound of water at 100 ? , causes 540 units I puss from the latent to the sensible state ? an amount of heat which is utilized in heating by steam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raising 4 pounds of cast iron to its melting-point . The quantity of heat which becomes free when aqueous vapor is condensed is sometimes utilized for heating private houses , lot houses , and public buildings . Steam is produced in boilers like those used in steam-engines , and passes thence into metal t obis concealed behind the wainscot , or into columns which serve at the same time as ornaments for rooms . The steam condensing in these pipes gives up a considerable quantity of heat , which they impart , to the surrounding air . The pipes being somewhat inclined , the condensed water flows back into the boiler , and thus a constant circulation is kept up . 2:t5 . DISTILLATION . STILL , . ? Distillation is an operation by which volatile liquid may be separated from substances which // it holds in solution , or by which liquids of different volatilities may be separated . The operation depends en conversion of liquid into vapor by the action of heal , and the condensation of the vapor by cooling . The apparatus used in distillation i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if . consists essentially of three parts : ( 1 ) the body , A ( fig. 155 ) , it copper vessel containing the liquid , the lowest part of which fits itt the furnace ; ( 2 ) the hard , B , which fits on the body , and from which a lateral lithe , ( ' , leads to ( 3 ) the worm , S , a long spiral till or copper tube , placed in a cistern kept constantly full of cold water . The object ( ) I ' the vertu is to condense the vapor , by exposing a great extent , of surface to the cold water . To free ordinary water from the many impurities which it often contains , it is placed in a still and healed . The vapor disengaged is condensed in the worm , and the distilled water arising from the condensation is collected in the receiver , I ) . The vapor , in condensing , rapidly heats the water in the cistern , which must , therefore , be constantly renewed . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the cistern , while the heated , and therefore lighter , water rises to the surface , and issues by a tube in the top of the cistern . Brandy is obtained from wine by means of distillation . Wine consists essentially of water , alcohol , and coloring matter ; when heated in a still to a temperature between 78 ? and 7 ( 10 ? , the alcohol , which boils at 78 ? , vaporizes , while water , which only boils at 100 ? , remains behind , or at all events only passes over in small quantity . The liquid which passes over ill this distillation is brandy , which is in effect dilute alcohol . 236 . APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING THE ALCOHOLIC VALUE OF WINES. ? One of the forms of this apparatus consists of a glass flask resting on a tripod , and heated by a spirit-lamp ( fig. 156 ) . By means of an india-rubber tube this is connected with a worm placed in a copper vessel filled with cold water , below which is a test-glass for collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a , which measures the quantify of wine taken : the two others indicating one half and one third of this volume . The measure is filled up to a with wine which is then poured into the flask , and , this having been connected with the worm , the distillation is commenced . The liquid which distils over is a mixture of alcohol and water . For ordinary wines , such as claret and hocks , about one third is distilled over ; and for wines richer in spirit , such as sherries and ports , one half must be distilled : experiment has shown that under these circumIM ) NATURAL PHILOSOPHY stances all the alcohol passes over in the distillate . The measure is then filled up with distilled water to a ; this gives the mixture of alcohol and water of the same volume as the wine taken , free from all solid matters , such as sugar , coloring matter , and acid , but containing all the alcohol . The specific gravity of this distillate is then taken by means of an alcoholometer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alcohol as indicated by the tables . 237 . LIQUEFACTION OF GASES. - We have already seen that a saturated vapor , the temperature of which is constant , is liquefied by diminishing the volume , and that , the volume remaining constant , it is brought into the liquid state by lowering the temperature . Unsaturated vapors behave in all respects like gases . And it is natural to suppose that what are ordinarily called permanent gases are really unsaturated vapors . For the gaseous form is accidental and is not inherent in the nature of the substance . At ordinary temperatures sulphurous acid is a gas , while in countries near the Poles it is a liquid ; in temperate climates ether is a liquid ? at a tropical temperature it is a gas . And just as unsaturated vapors may be brought to the state of saturation , and be then liquefied by suitably diminishing the temperature or increasing the pressure , so , by the same means , gases may be liquefied . But , as they are mostly very far removed from this state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them may , indeed , be liquefied either by cold or by pressure ; for // the majority , however , both processes must be simultaneously employed . No gases can resist these combined actions , and those which for long resisted all attempts to liquefy them ? hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , nitric oxide , and carbonic oxide ? become liquid when submitted to a sufficient degree of cold and pressure . For every gas there is a temperature above which it can not be liquefied , however great be the pressure applied ; this is called the critical temperature of the gas ; in the case of carbonic acid it is 31 ? . The pressure which must be applied to a gas at the critical temperature in order to liquefy it is called the critical pressure ; for carbonic acid it is 73 atmospheres . The lower is the temperature of a gas below the critical temperature the less is the pressure required to liquefy it ; thus carbonic acid at 13 ? requires 45 atmospheres and only 35 at 00 . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critical pressure 470 atmospheres . Fig. 157 illustrates the principle of the method by which Faraday liquefied certain gases ; in one limb of a stout bent glass tube are placed the substances which act chemically on each other and evolve the gas to be liquefied ; the other limb is her-metically sealed . On heating the , right limb in an oil bath the gas is disengaged , and in the degree in which this occurs the pressure iii-creases , and the gas ultimately liquefies and collects in t he other leg ; the process is accelerated by placing this in a free/lug mixture . Solid carbonic acid evaporates very slowly , ; aid is a perfectly harmless substance . By means of an alcohol the rmometer its temperature has been found to be about - 90 " . A small quantity placed on the hand does not produce the sensation of such great cold as might be expected . This arises from Ilse imperfect contact . But if the solid be mixed with ether , the cold produced is so intense that when a little is placed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a mixture of the two substances solidifies four times its weight of mercury in a few minutes . When a tube containing liquid carbonic acid is placed in this mixture the liquid becomes solid , and looks like a transparent piece of ice . When this mixture is placed under the receiver of an air-pump and rarefaction produced the temperature sinks to ? NATURAL PHILOSOPHY Liquid nitrous oxide solidifies in consequence of the cold produced by its volatilization forming a mass the melting-point which is - 105 ? C. The condensation of gases is now carried Out on an industrial scale . // CHAPTER IX . SPE ( ; Il'IC ILEAT . CALORIMETRY. 238 . CALORIMETRY . THERMAL UNIT. ? The province of calorimetry is the measurement of the quantity of heat which a body parts with or absorbs when its temperature sinks or rises through a certain number of degrees , or when it changes its condition . We must distinguish between quantity of heat and temperature the temperature of a red-hot iron poker will be very considerably higher than that of a bucket of hot water , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater . A quantity of heat may be expressed by any of its effects which can be directly measured , but the most convenient is the alteration of temperature ; and quantities of heat are usually defined by stating the extent to which they are capable of raising the temperature of a known weight of a substance , such as water . The unit chosen for comparison , and called the thermal unit , is not everywhere the same . In France it is the quantify ( ) I ' heat necessary to raise the temperature of one kilogramme of water through one degree Centigrade ; this is called the calorie . In this book we shall adopt , as a thermal unit , the quality of heat necessary to raise one pound of water through one degree Centigrade ; 1 calorie-2.2 thermal units , and one thermal unit C. ICI calorie . 239 . SPECIFIC HEAT. ? When equal weights of two different substances at the same temperature ? mercury ; 111 ( 1 wafter , for example ? are placed in similar vessels and subjected for the same length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or are placed at the same distance in front of the same tire , it is found that after a time their temperatures will differ considerably ; the mercury will be much hotter than the water . But as , from the conditions of the experiment , they have , during all this time , been receiving heat at the same rate , it is clear that the quantity of heat which is sufficient to raise the temperature of mercury through a certain number of degrees will only raise the temperature of the same quantity of water through a less number of degrees ? in other words , that it requires more heat to raise the temperature of NATURAL PHILOSOPHY Water through one degree than it does to raise the temperature of an equal quantity of mercury by the same amount . Conversely , if the same quantities of water and of mercury at 100 ? C. be allowed to cool down to the temperature of the atmosphere , the water will require a much longer time for this purpose than the mercury ; hence , in cooling through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat than does mercury . The difference of the specific heats of solids may be illustrated by means of the apparatus depicted in fig. 158 , which represents two equal vessels , c and c ' , containing equal weights of water at the same temperature . These vessels are each embedded in an outer vessel , d and d ' , a non-conducting layer of cotton wool being placed between . Two coils , one of sheet iron , a ' , and the other of sheet lead , a , of the same weight , are heated in an air-bath to the same high temperature , and are then rapidly introduced into the water through the apertures in the lids , and b ' , so as to rest on the per- : forated discs , s and s ' . These can be moved up and down so as to equalize the temperature throughout the liquid . When the respective thermometers , t and 1 ' , cease to rise , they are read off , and it is seen that the temperature indicated by the thermometer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the lead . If a pound of water at 100 ? is mixed with a pound of water at zero , the mixture has a temperature of 50 ? . But if a pound of mercury at 100 ? is mixed with a pound of water at zero , the temperature of the mixture will only be about 3 ? ? that is to say , while Ilse mercury has cooled through 07 ? , the temperature of the water has only been raised 3 ? . Consequently , for the same weight , water requires about 32 times as much heat as mercury does to exhibit the same rise of temperature . Again , if a pound of water at 10 ? be shaken with a pound of turpentine at 60 ? , the temperature of the mixture will be about 24 ? . So that the heat which turpentine gives out in sinking through 3 ( 3 degrees will only raise the temperature of an equal weight of water through 14 degrees ; or , in other words , the heat required to raise // turpentine through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that required to raise the same weight of water through the same range . If similar experiments are mule with otter substances , it will be found that the quantity .. I ' heal . required to effect a certain change of temperature is different for almost every substance ; and we speak of the specific /Hut of a body is the quantity of heat which it absorbs when its temperature rises through a given range of temperature ? front o ? to 1 ? , for example- - compared with the quantity of heat which would be absorbed under the same circumstances by the salve weight of water . In other words , water is taken as the standard . for the comparison of specific duals . ' Pints , to say that the specific heat of silver is 0.057 means that , the quantity of heat which would raise the temperature of any given weight of silver through 1 ? C. would only raise the temperature of the same weight of water through 0.057 ? C. , or that the quantity of heat which would raise a given weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver through 17.5 ? C. The specific heat of water being unity , that of air is 0.237 if we compare equal weights of the two substances . Hence a pound of water in losing one degree of temperature would raise D the temperature of 4.2 pounds of air through one degree . But as water is 770 times as heavy as air , if we compare equal volumes , a cubic foot of water in sinking through one degree of temperature would raise 3,234 cubic feet of air one degree . 240 . DETERMINATION OF THE SPECIFIC HEATS rm. 150 . OF SOLIDS AND OF ' LIQUIDS. ? Three methods have been employed for determining the specific heats of bodies : ( i ) the method of melting ice , ( ii ) the method of mixtures , and ( iii ) that of cooling . Method of the fusion of ice. ? This method of determining specific heats is based on the fact that to melt a pound . of ice 80 thermal units are necessary . The substance whose specific heat is to be determined is raised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then rapidly placed in ice . In cooling from 100 ? to zero , the body melts a certain quantity of ice , which is collected in the form of water . From the weight of this water , from that of the body , and from the number of degrees through which it is cooled , the specific heat may be readily deduced by a simple calculation . NATURAL PHILOSOPHY Lavoieicr and Laplace 's ice calorimeter is represented in section In fig. 159 . It consists of three concentric tin vessels , M , A , B , each with a cover of the same material ; in the central one is placed the body , NI , whose specific heat is to be determined , while the spaces between M and A , and between A and B , are filled with pounded ice . The ice in the compartment A is melted by the heated body , and the water resulting from the liquefaction runs off by the stopcock D , and is collected in a vessel ; the ice in the compartment B cuts off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives issue to the water which arises from the liquefaction of the ice in B. Method of mixtures. ? This is a much more accurate and convenient method than that of the fusion of ice , and is essentially that of the experiments cited above to establish the fact of specific heat . The solid body whose specific heat is to be determined is weighed and raised to a known temperature , by being kept , for instance , for some time in a closed space heated by steam ; it is then immersed in a mass of cold water , the weight and temperature of which are known . The water becomes warmed by the heat given up by the body in cooling , and both come at last to the same temperature . From this common temperature , from the respective weights of the water and of the substance , and , lastly , from their temperatures at the time of mixture , the specific heat of the body is deduced by a simple calculation . 241 . METHOD OF COOLING. ? Equal weights of different bodies whose specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same number of degrees . This principle is applied in determining the specific heats of liquids in the following manner : ? A small polished silver vessel , V ( fig. 160 ) , is filled with the liquid and a thermometer placed in it . This vessel is heated to a certain temperature , and is then introduced into a copper vessel , E , in which it fits hermetically . This copper vessel is exhausted through the tube tt ' , and maintained at the constant temperature of melting ice , MN , and the time noted which the substance takes in falling through a given range of temperature , from 15 ? to 5 ? // for example . The experiment is repeated with a standard liquid , and the times which equal weights of different bodies require for cooling through the same range of temperature the directly as their specific heats . It will be seen from the above table that water and oil of tureen tine have a much greater specific heat than that of . other substances , and more especially than the metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires a relatively long time in being heated or cooled ; and that , for the same weight and temperature , it absorbs or gives out far more heat than other substances . This double property is applied in heating by hot water , and it plays a most important part in they economy of nature . Those bodies which have great specific heat , and therefore which require a great quantity of heat to raise them to a given temperature , also give out a great quantity in cooling through the same range . This difference between bodies as to the quantities of heat they contain may be illustrated by a simple experiment . A number of equal bullets of various metals , iron , lead , bismuth , and copper , are heated to a temperature of about 200 ? C. by immersing them in hot oil ; they are then placed on a cake or beeswax , CD , about half an inch in thickness ( fig. 161 ) . It will then be found that the iron and copper melt through , while the lead and bismuth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half their way through the wax . NATURAL PHILOSOPHY CHAPTER X. STEAM-ENGINE. 242 . INVENTION OF the STEAM-ENGINE. ? The steam-engine is undoubtedly the most important of the applications of the physical sciences . Based on the very great elastic force which aqueous vapor assumes at a high temperature and on the condensation of this vapor by cooling , the steam-engine , in a small volume and at a small expense , produces very considerable motive power . In 1705 Newcomen and Cawley constructed a steam-engine , or " fire-pump , " as it was then called , the object of which was to drain mines . In this engine the steam was produced separately in a boiler , below the cylinder , containing the piston . The condensation also was effected by cold water from a cistern , being injected into the cylinder through a cock . This was opened when the piston was to descend , the descent being effected by atmospheric pressure , and was closed after the descent ; a second one was opened , through which steam entered , and so on . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cold water , the steam which filled it was partially condensed , until the sides were again heated ; there was thus a considerable loss of steam , and therefore of fuel . The condensed water flowed out by a pipe , at the end of which was a valve , which opened as the piston descended . Motion was transmitted by a beam to the pump-rod . James Watt , a mathematical-instrument maker in Glasgow , had to repair the model of a Newcomen 's engine belonging to the physiical cabinet of the University . Struck by the enormous quantity of steam and of condensing water used by this engine , he entered upon a long series of researches and improvements , which he pursued with admirable perseverance for fifty years , without ever being content with the success he obtained . Thus it was that Newcomen 's machine , successively changed and improved in all its parts , at last really became Watt 's machine . Condenser. ? Watt 's first and principal invention was that of the condenser . This name is given to a closed vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only connected with it by // a tube provided with a stopcock . In this vessel cold water is injected , and the vapor is condensed by opening the connecting stopcock . Thus , as the side of the cylinder is not cooled , all the steam which enters there is utilized . Thus there was effected so great an economy of steam , and therefore of fuel , that Watt and Boulton ( his partner ) , having taken a patent , realized great profits by only requiring , for a certain number of years , a third of the saving in the consumption of coal , as compared with Newcomen 's engine . Single-acting engine. ? In Newcomen 's engine , the cylinder of which was open at the top , the steam only lifted the piston ; and then , when the steam was condensed , the pressure of the atmosphere brought it clown again ; whence the name atmospheric engine . by which it was designated . As the piston descended , air passel into the cylinder and cooled the sides , in consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was condensed until the sides were again heated . To remove this source of less , Watt closed the cylinder altogether , and caused the vapor to net above the piston , so as to make it descend ; then , by an arrangement of stopcocks , alternately opened and closed by the action of the engine itself , the steam passed simultaneously above and below the piston . This , being pressed equally in opposite directions , remained in equilibrium ; so that a simple counterpoise acting by means of : i lever at the end of a piston-rod raised the piston again , and so on . This machine , into which the air did not enter , and where the mospheric pressure did not act , was called the single-acting slights , to express that the steam had a useful action on only one side of the piston . The single-acting engine had the great disadvantage that it . had no real force except when the piston was descending . It cou ld transmit motion to pumps for emptying mines , because , for that , effort in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . furnish a sufficiently regular motion for many industries ? for cotton manufactures , for instance . Hence Watt 's task was not , completed , but he was not long in finding another plan . Double-acting engine. ? In this engine , one form of which we shall presently describe , and which is represented in fig. 162 , the cylinder is closed both at the top and at the bottom , but the steam acts alternately on the two faces of the piston ? that is to say , by a system of valves , opened and closed by the engine itself , when the lower part of the cylinder communicates with the condenser , the upper part is connected with the boiler , and the steam , acting on the piston , causes it to descend . Then , when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke , the parts change : the lop of the cylinder is in connection with the condenser , and the bottom with the boiler ; the , 4o NATURAL PHILOSOPHY FIG. 162. piston rises again , and so forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a continuous circular motion , as will be presently described . Air-pump. ? Watt completed his engine by the addition of three // pumps , which are worked by the enngine , and play an important part . For the cold water of the condensor becomes rapidly heated by the heat which the steam gives up to it , and this water , soon reaching 100 ? , would no longer condense the steam . Moreover , the air , which is always dissolved in cold muter , is lily rated in the boiler , owing to the increase in temperature . Now , this air , passing both above and home Ilse pi Gott , would soon stop its motion . To prevent these two injuries effects , Wattt applied to the engine a suction-pump , which continually withdrew front Ilse condenser the air and water which tended to accumulate there . Feed-pump and cold water pump. ? The two other pinups which Watt added are the feed , hint , and the cold-water pump . The first is a force-pump which sends into the boilers the hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing a considerable saving fuel . The other is a suction-pump , which raises , either from a well or a river , or some other source , the cold water intended to replace that heated in the condenser and withdrawn by the air-pump . Besides the important parts which have thus been described . we owe to Watt the arrangement for distributing the steam alternately above and below the piston ; the regulator , whose function , when the machine works too slowly , is to admit more steam into the cylinder , and , on the other hand , to diminish the quantity when the velocity is too great ; lastly , the parallelogram , devised by Watt , which imparts to the piston-rod a rectilinear motion . It may be added that Watt , who began life as a philosophical-instrument maker , carried into the execution of these great pieces of machinery the same perfection as is required for the best scientific instrument . 243 . DESCRIPTION OF THE DOUBLE-ACTING Engine . We have already seen that the double-acting engine is that in which the steam acts alternately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine of this kind , and fig. 166 gives a section of the cylinder , of the piston , and of the distribution of steam . The entire engine is of iron . To the piston , T , is fixed a rod , A , which slides with gentle friction in a tubulure , LT , placed at ; the centre of the plate which closes the cylinder ( fig. 166 ) . As it is very important that no steam shall escape between the pstion-rod and this tubulure , the latter is formed of two pieces , one attached to the plate , while the other , which fits in the first , can be pressed as tightly as is desired , so as to compress the material soaked with fat which is between the two tubulures . This arrangement is called a stuffing-box it prevents the escape of steam without interfering with the motion of the piston-rod . On the two sides of the cylinder are two columns , h , h ( fig. 162 ) , 16 t , NATURAL PHILOSOPHY which guide the piston-rod in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with a long piece , B , called the connecting-rod , which in turn is jointed with a shorter piece , M , called the crank , the length of which is just half that of the stroke of the piston . The crank is rigidly fixed to a horizontal shaft , D , so that it can not move without transmitting its motion . By means of this connecting-rod and crank , the alternating rectilinear motion of the piston and of the rod is changed into a continuous circular motion ; for the rod , during the ascent of the piston , acts upwards upon the crank , making it turn in the direction of the arrow . When the piston is at the top of its stroke , the connecting-rod and the crank are vertical , one in front of the other . As the piston descends , the connecting-rod again acts , so as always to turn the shaft in the same direction ; and when the piston is at the bottom of the stroke , crank and connecting-rod are again vertical , but one is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shaft , which has made half a turn during the ascent , makes a second one during the descent , and thus performs a complete revolution during each double oscillation of the piston . To transmit the motion to machinery , on the shaft , D , is fixed a pulley , G , on which works an endless band , X Y , of leather , which works on another pulley fixed to the machinery to be turned . Moved by the first pulley , this band communicates its motion to the second ; in this manner the motion is transmitted to all the workshops of a large factory . On the right of the fixed sheave , G , there is a second , which is not fixed to the horizontal shaft . This is the loose pulley . Its object is to suspend all the motion in the machine without stopping the steam-engine . By means of an iron fork , not seen in the figure , which incloses the band , the latter may be slid from the fixed to the movable pulley . As this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion of the latter is not transmitted to it . On the horizontal shaft is a very largo iron wheel , V , called the fly-wheel , which is necessary for keeping up the motion ; for each time that the piston is at the top or bottom of its stroke , there is a momentary arrest , during which the motion of the whole machine tends to stop . These are called the dead points . It is then that the fly-wheel , in virtue of its inertia and of its acquired velocity , moves the horizontal shaft , and thus keeps up a regular motion . 294 . ECCENTRIC . SLIDE-VALVE. ? The eccentric is an arrangement by which a continuous circular motion is changed into an alternating rectilinear motion . It is very frequently used in machinery . One of these is fitted to the horizontal shaft at E , and the other // at e ( fig. 162 ) . The former works the feed-pump , and the latter the slide-valve . The action of each is the same . Figs. 163 and 164 represent it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It consists of a circular piece , RE , fixed to the horizontal shaft , but in such a manner that the centre of rotation does not coincide with the centre of the piece ; the latter being at C , the former at O. It follows from this construction that the point C constantly describes a circle about 0 , which is represented in the drawing by a dotted line . Hence , in each half-turn it passes from the position represented in fig. 163 to that represented in fig. 164 , and vice versa . To use this motion , the eccentric is surrounded by a collar , m n , in which it can turn freely like an axle in its box ; hence , during the rotation of the horizontal shaft , the collar shares the ascending and descending motion of the point C , but not its rotatory mot ion . The eccentric alone turns , the collar only rises and sinks . By thus transmitting its motion to a rod , i , it works the valve-chest , or the feed-pump . Slide-valve. ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement by which steam passes alternately above and below the piston . Figs. 165 and 166 present a vertical section o I ' these parts and of the cylinder . The steam enters the valve-chest from the boiler by the brass tube x . From the valve-chest two conduits , a and b , are connected with the cylinder , one above and the other below . If they were both open at once , the steam , acting equally on the two faces of the piston , would keep it at rest . But one of these is always closed by the slide-valve , y , fixed to a rod , i . This moves alternately up and down , by means of the eccentric , e ( fig. 162 ) , on the horizontal shaft as described above . In fig. 166 the slide-valve closes the conduit a , and , allowing the steam to enter at b , below the piston , the latter rises . But when it reaches the top of the stroke the eccentric passes from the position represented in fig. 163 to that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it the slide-valve , which then closes the ee i u u i t b , and allows the steam to enter at a ( fig. 165 ) . The piston then sinks , and so forth at each displacement of the slide-valve . In completing this account of the manner iii which steam is distributed , it remains to explain what happens when the steam presses below the piston ( fig. 166 ) . It must not remain above , otherwise the piston could not move . But while the steam enters below by the conduit b , the top of the cylinder , by means of the conduit a , is connected with a cavity , 0 , from which passes the tube L ( fig. 162 ) . Through this tube the steam which has already acted upon the piston passes into the atmosphere , or else is condensed in a vessel filled with cold water , which has been already mentioned ? the conNATURAL PHILOSOPHY denier . I f , on the other hand , the piston sinks , the slide-valve being in the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the conduit b , to the cavity 0 , and to the tube Ii . 215 . Regulation OR GOVERNOR . The object of this arrangement is to regulate or govern the quantity of steam which reaches the valve-chest , increasing it when the machine works too slowly and diminishing it when it works too rapidly . It consists of a parallelogram , kr ( fig. 162 ) , each angle of which is jointed . A toothed beveled wheel , a , connected with the horizontal shaft , transmits its motion to a similar wheel , b , fixed to the rod , c , which supports the parallelogram . This turns , then , with the rod the more rapidly the greater the speed of the shaft . But the two upper arms are provided with solid balls , m and n ; moreover , a socket , r , to which are attached the two lower arms , is not fixed to the rod c , but can glide along it . Hence the centrifugal force acting on the balls m and n makes them diverge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its motion co a lever , s , the short arm of which , being lowered , presses upon a long rod , t . This , inclining the lever 0 , effects a small rotation in a valve placed in the tube x , by which steam comes ( figs. 165 , 166 ) . This valve , by opening or closing , admits more or less steam . 246 . FEED-PUMP. ? The object of this , as its name implies , is to replace the water in the boiler as fast as it evaporates . In fig. 162 this pump , placed at Q , on the left of the drawing , receives its // motion from an eccentric by means of a long rod , and it works both as cold-wale , ' wimp and as feed-pump ; as cold-water pump , inasmuch as it withdraws water from a well by a suction-pipe placed below the engine ; and as feed-pump by its then forcing water into the boiler by the pipe It . 247 . VARIOUS KINDS OF STEAM-ENGINES. ? A low-pressure engine is one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of an atmosphere ; and a high-pressure engine is one in which the pressure of the steam usually exceeds this amount considerably . Low-pressure engines are mostly condensing engines ? in other words , they generally have a condenser when the steam becomes condensed after having acted on tho piston : on the other hand , high-pressure engines are frequently without it condenser ; the locomotive is an example . If the communication between the cylinder and the boiler remains open during the whole motion of the piston , the steam retains practically the same pressure , and is said to act without expansion ; but , if by a suitable arrangement of the slide-valve , the steam ceases to pass into the cylinder when the piston is at 2/3 or 31 // its course , then the steam expands ? that is to say , in virtue of elastic force , which is due to the high temperature , it still acts OA the piston and causes it to finish its course . Hence a distinction is made between engines expanding and non-expanding with ? team . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the elastic force of the steam is not great . But for high or mean-pressure engines it not only effects a great saving in steam , and therefore in fuel , but it regulates the motion , by dimin- ishing the pressure the moment the acquired velocity of the piston tends to increase . 248 . WORK OF AN ENGINE . HORSE-POWER. ? The work of an engine is measured by the mean pressure on the piston , multiplied by t he area of the piston , multiplied by the length of the stroke . Here and in England , the unit of work is the foot-pound ? that is , the work performed in raising a weight of one pound through a height of a foot . Thus , to raise a weight of 14 pounds through a height of 20 feet would require 280 foot-pounds . In France the kilogrammetre is used ? that is , the work performed in raising a kilo- // gramme through a metre . This unit corresponds to 7.233 footpounds . The rate of work in machines is the amount of work performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example . Here the rates of work are compared by means of horse-power , which is a conventional unit , and represents 33,000 foot-pounds per minute of 550 per second . In France a similar unit is used , called the chevalvapeur , which represents the work performed in raising 75 kilogrammes through one metre in a second . It is equal to about 542 foot-pounds per second . Thus , suppose it steam-engine with a piston the area of which is 30 square inches , and its length of stroke 18 inches , and that it makes 84 up and down strokes in a minute . Suppose , - further that the mean pressure on the piston is equal to 14 pounds on a square inch . The work that the steamengine performs is equal to 30 X 14 X 84 X 2 X 1% =105,840 footpounds per minute . From this must be deducted the work expended in overcoming the friction of the machine , working the pumps , etc . Taking these at 35 per cent. , there remains a useful effect of 68,796 foot-pounds per minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents about 2 horse-power. 249 . STEAM-BOILER . ? We have still to describe the steam-boiler , or the arrangement by which the steam is generated , and its various accessories . Fig. 167 gives a longitudinal and fig. 1 ( i8 a transverse section of a steam-boiler and its furnace . The steam-boiler consists of a long wrought-iron cylinder , PQ , with hemispherical ends . Below are two cylinders , B B , of smaller diameter , which are called heaters , and which are connected with the boiler by two strong tubes . The object of these heaters is to expose a greater surface to be heated . They are full of water , as also are the tubes which connect them with the boiler , which is only half full . The feed-water , sent by the pump , Q ( fig. 162 ) , reaches the boiler by a pipe , it ( fig. 167 ) , which passes to the bottom to prevent cold water from condensing steam ; a second pipe , n , leads the steam to the valve-chest . In the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATURAL PHILOSOPHY A manhole , the object of which is to allow workmen to enter the boiler when it needs repairs . This hole , as well as two front ones , B B , of the heaters , is closed by what is called an autoclave . Here 1110 cover , instead of being on the outside , is on the inside . A screw , ' I ' , fixed to this cover makes it press against the sides ; and as the pressure of the steam acts in the same direction , the greater the pressure the more tightly is the vessel closed . The furnace in which the boiler is placed is so constructed as to cause the heat to act upon a large surface , and to render the combustion as complete as possible . The products of combustion pass into tall chimneys , which from their great height increase the draught and thereby promote combustion . 250 . FLOAT. ? This is a small apparatus , the object of which is to show the level of water in the boiler . It consists of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stone , F ' , and at the other a counterpoise , a ( fig. 167 ) . The mass F ' weighs more than the counterpoise a ; but , as it is immersed in water , and thus loses part of its weight , it is in equilibrium , and the lever is horizontal so long as the level of water is at the desired height . But it sinks when there is too little water , and rises in the contrary direction when there is too much . Guided by these indications , the stoker can regulate the supply of water . 251 . SAFETY-VALVE. ? The pressure of steam in the boiler is measured by means of the manometer . But this instrument would not prevent explosions if its indications were neglected . Hence safety-valves are placed on boilers similar to that which Papin adopted in his digester . Fig. 169 represents on a larger scale one of these valves . It consists of a metal stopper , c , closing a tubulure , A , fixed on the boiler . To prevent this from sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sides , as seen at S. It thus more resembles a clack-valve than an ordinary stopper . On the piece rests a movable lever , ab , loaded with a weight , p . By moving this along the lever the load on the valve can be modified at will . For this purpose marks are placed which indicate the position of the load corresponding to given pressures . Thus , suppose it is desired that the pressure shall not exceed five atmospheres , the weight is placed at the division 5 on the lever . Then , as long as the pressure is less than five , the safety-valve remains closed ; but // if the pressure exceeds this amount , the valve opens and gives exit to the steam , thus preventing an explosion . 252 . SAFETY-WHISTLE. ? This is another safety apparatus , which indicates at a distance when the level of water in the boiler is too low . It consists of a float , IF ( fig. 170 ) , supported by a lever , ih , which moves about the joint a counterpoise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conical stopper , a , fixed to the lever , closes a tubulure on the boiler . This tubulure is closed at the top by two hollow hemispheres . In the centre of the lower one is a disc , which Fie . 170. does not quite reach the edges . Between the two hemispheres is a circular interval , through which vapor escapes when the cone a does not close the tubulure . As long as the water is at the right height the float F is raised , and presses the cone against the tubulure ; but if the level sinks , the float sinks , and with it the cone . The steal ! ' escapes round the disc e , and gives a very acute sound in striking against the edges of the upper hemisphere , which are beveled.The system constitutes , in fact , a short stopped organ-pipe , yielding therefore a very acute sound . On locomotives a similar whistle enables the driver to signal at a great distance by opening a stopcock , which allows the steam to escape . ' 4 ) NATURAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province of hygrometry is to determine the quantity of aqueous vapor or moisture contained in a given volume of air . The quantity is very variable ; the atmosphere can scarcely ever be said to be completely saturated with vapor , even in our climate . Nor is it ever completely dry ; for if hygroscopic substances ? that is to say , substances with a great affinity for water , such as calcium chloride , sulphuric acid , quicklime , etc. ? be at any time exposed to the air , they absorb more or less aqueous vapor . The humidity does not depend on the absolute quantity of aqueous vapor present in the air , but on the greater or less distance of the temperature of the air from that at which the vapor would be saturated . Thus , if a cubic yard of air contains 150 grains of moisture , this weight represents the absolute quantity of moisture present ; if the air is at a temperature of 20 ? C. , the quantity of moisture it could contain in a state of saturation is 204 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ =0.735 , represents 204 the relative humidity or the hygrometric state . Under these circumstances we should say that the air is nearly three-quarters saturated . When the air is cold , it may be moist with very little vapor , and , on the contrary , when it is warm , it may be very dry , even with a large quantity of vapor . In summer the air usually contains more aqueous vapor than in winter , notwithstanding which it is less moist , because as the temperature is higher the vapor is farther from its point of saturation . When a room is warmed , the quantity of moisture is not diminished , but the humidity of the air is lessened , because its point of saturation is raised . The air may thus become so dry as to be injurious to health , and accordingly vessels of water are frequently placed on the stoves used for heating . The quantity of vapor contained in the air varies greatly with the seasons , the climate , the temperature , and various local causes . A mean degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a state of great dryness as in the case , for instance , during the prevalence of northeast winds the transpiration through the skin is too abundant ; the ' skin dries up and chaps and in general discomfort ensues . In an atmosphere which is too moist , . transpiration is slower , and a feeling of depression : and heaviness is felt . Hence it is necessary to regulate in it suitable manner the moisture of dwelling-rooms , so as to avoid these two extremes . 254 . Hygroscopes . ' Flier are two classes .. f instruments by which the hygrometric state I. the air may he ascertained . One class , called hygroscopes , simply tell whether the air is more or less moist , but give no indications as to the quantity of moisture it contains ; others , called hygrometers , enable unto measure it with somo accuracy . All substances which absorb aqueous vapor , like common salt and many others known as deliquescent salts , may serve as hygroscopes . This is also the case with a great number of animal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hair , catgut , etc. , which lengthen as the air becomes moist , but contract as it becomes dry , and thus give an indication of the greater or less quantity of vapor in the air . The spiral awns of certain geraniums which unroll in moist air m ay serve as hygroscopes . A branch of pine which has been peeled , and the stouter end of which is fixed in a wall indicates changes in the moisture of the air by its greater or less curvature . A great number of instruments have been constructed on this principle which serve as hygroscopes . One , which is sometimes useful , is the hair or Saussure 's hygroscope . It consists of a brass frame ( fig. 171 ) , on which is fixed a hair , e , fastened at the top in a clamp , a . The lower part of the hair passes round a pulley , o , and supports a small weight , p . To the pulley is attached an index which moves over a graduated scale . FIG. 171 . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer and the point of the index moves down . With a drier atmosphere the hair shortens and the point rises . To this class of hygroscopes belong the chimney ornaments , one of the most common forms of which is that of a small male and female figure , so arranged in reference to a little house , with two doors , that when it is moist the man goes out , and the woman goes in , and vice versa when it is fine . They are founded on the 2b2 NATURAL PHILOSOPHY property which twisted strings or pieces of catgut possess of untwisting when moist , and of twisting when dry . As these hygroscopes only change slowly , their indications are always behindhand with the state of the weather ; nor are they , moreover , very exact . ' 255 . HYGROMETERS. ? The most exact of all hygrometers is the chemical hygrometer . This consists essentially of an arrangement by which a measured volume of air is passed through a series of drying tubes ? that is , tubes containing some hygroscopic substance , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These tubes , having been previously weighed , are weighed again after the operation ; an increase of weight is observed , which is due to the moisture absorbed by the hygroscopic substance , and this increase represents the weight of the moisture in the volume of air taken . This method is very exact , but it is both difficult and tedious of execution . More convenient than the above are what are called condensation hygrometers , in which the vapor of the atmosphere is made to condense on a body artificially cooled . This may be illustrated by having a small cup of polished metal in which are placed some water , a lump of ice , and a delicate thermometer . When the vessel gradually cools in a moist atmosphere , the layer of air in immediate contact with it cools also , and a point is ultimately reached at which the vapor present is just sufficient to saturate the air : the least diminution of temperature then causes a precipitation of moisture on the cup in the form of dew . When the temperature rises again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two temperatures is taken as the dew-point . A very convenient form of hygrometer , and one the use of which is rapidly extending , is that known as the psychrometer or wet-bulb hygrometer , which is based on the principle that a moistened body evaporates in the air more rapidly in proportion as the air is drier , and , in consequence of this evaporation , the temperature of the body sinks . It consists of two delicate thermometers placed on a wooden stand . One of the bulbs is covered with muslin , and is kept continually moist by being connected with a reservoir of water by means of a string . Unless the air is saturated with moisture , the wet-bulb thermometer always indicates a lower temperature than the other , and the difference between the indications of th two thermometers is greater in proportion as the air is drier . According to Glaisher , the temperature of the dew-point may be obtained by multiplying the difference between the temperatures of // the wet and dry bulbs by a factor which depends on the temperature of the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus obtained from this last-named temperature . The following are the numbers : - - These are often known as Glaisher 's factors . The temperatures are expressed on the Fahrenheit scale . As an example : if the temperature of the wet bulb is 49 ? and that of the dry bulb 54 ? , then the dew-point is 44 ? ? that is , at this temperature the moisture present in the atmosphere would be just sufficient to saturate it . // CHAPTER XII . METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA WHICH DEPEND UPON HEAT . 256 . METEOROLOGY. ? Meteorology is that branch of physics which is concerned with the phenomena which occur in the atmosphere ? such , for instance , as variations in the temperature of the air , wind , rain , storms , electric phenomena , etc. 257 . MEAN TEMPERATURE. ? The mean daily temperature , or simply temperature , is that obtained by adding together 24 hourly observations and dividing by 24 . A very close approximation to the mean temperature is obtained by taking the mean of the highest and lowest temperatures of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maximum and minimum thermometers . These ought to be well protected from the sun 's rays , raised above the ground , and be far from all objects which might influence them by their radiation . The lowest mean daily temperature is at 4 A.M. , and the highest at 2 P.U . The temperature of a month is the mean of those of . 30 days , and the temperature of a year is the mean of those of 12 months . The highest mean monthly temperature is in July , and the lowest in January . The temperature of a place is the mean of its annual temperature for a great series of years . The temperatures in all cases are those of the air , and not those of the ground . 258 . CAUSES WHICH MODIFY the Temperature of the Air. ? The principal causes which modify the temperature of the air are the latitude of a place , its height ? that is , its distance above sea-level ? the direction of the wind , and the proximity of seas . Influence of the latitude. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminishes from the equator towards the poles . This is due to the fact that the sun 's rays , which are vertical at the equator , are more and more inclined as we come nearer the poles . Now , the more acute is the angle under which the rays of heat fall upon a body , the less is the body heated ; hence the heat absorbed decreases from the equator to the poles . Yet , as in summer the days are longer as we get nearer the north , the loss due to the increasing obliquity of the sun is partially compensated by the sun rei1ETE0190t.0 ( ,1 ( ' : 11. // maining longer above the iron . Under the equator , where the length of the days is constant , Ihe temperature is almost invariable ; in the latitude of the mere northerly countries , where the days are very unequal , the temperature varies greatly ; bill . in summer it sometimes rises almost ; as high as : under the equator . The lowering of the temperature produced by the change in latitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c.1 n place above the sea level has a much more considerable influence on the temperature than its latitude . Iii the temperate rove an ascent of 510 feet corresponds to a diminution in the average temperature of 1 " C. The cooling as we an cud iii the atmosphere has beau observed in balloon ascent , , : final a further proof of it is seen in Ilse perpetual snows which cover the highest mountains , even in the torrid none . The height at which snow remains unmelted through the year which is known as the snow line , or line of perpetual soon ' , differs in different places . On the Andes it commences at a height of 14,760 feet , on the Alps at 8,880 feet , and in Iceland at 3,070 feet . Direction of winds. ? As winds share the temperature ( ) f t lie countries which they have traversed , their direction exercises great influence on the temperature in any place . In our climate ( he hottest winds are the south , then come the southeast , the southwest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , lastly , the northeast , which is the coldest . The character of the wind changes with ( lie seasons . Proximity of sea. ? The neighborhood of the sea lends to render the temperature of the air uniform , by warming it in winter and cooling it in summer . The average temperature of the -. ea in equatorial and polar countries is always different from that of the atmosphere . With reference to the uniformity of the temperature , it has been found that in temperate regions ? that is , front 25 to 50 degrees of latitude ? the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature of a day does not exceed , on the sea , 2 ? to 3 ? C. , while upon land it amounts to 12 ? to 15 ? . I n islands the uniformity of temperature is maintained , even during the greatest heats . In continents , on the contrary , the winters for the same latitudes become colder , and the difference between the temperatures of summer and winter becomes greater . 259 . GULF STREAM. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by currents of warm water . The mildness of th , climate in the northwest of Europe is usually assigned to one of these ? the Gulf Stream . This great body of water , taking its origin in equatorial regions , flows through the Gulf of Mexico , whence it derives its name ; passing by the southern shores of North Amer960 NATURAL PHILOSOPHY lea , it mikes its way in a northwesterly direction across the Atlantic and finally washes the coast of Ireland and t northwest of Europe generally . It traverses 3,000 miles in about seventyeight , days . Its temperature in the Gulf is about 2s " ( 1. , and is generally a little more than 5 ? C. higher than the rest of the ocean , on which it floats owing to its lower specific gravity . To its influence is due the milder climate of western Europe as compared with that of the opposite coast of America ; thus , the River Hudson , which is in the same latitude as Rome , is frozen during three months in the year . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe by a girdle of open sea ; and hence the harbor of Hammerfest is open the year round . Besides its influence in thus moderating climate , the Gulf Stream is an important help to navigators . It has been calculated that the amount of heat which is transported by the Gulf Stream from tropical America toward the east is sufficient to keep constantly melted a mass of iron equal to the volume of the Mississippi . 260 . ISOTHERMAL LINES. ? When all the points on a map whose temperature is known to be the same are joined , curves are obtained which Humboldt first described , and which he called isothermal lines . If the temperature of a place only varied with the obliquity of the sun 's rays ? that is , with the latitude ? isothermal lines would all be parallel to the equator ; but as the temperature is influenced by many local causes , especially by the height above the sea-level and the distribution of land and water , the isothermal lines are always more or less curved . On the sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made between isothermal lines , isotheral lines , and isochimenal lines , where the mean general , the mean summer , and the mean winter temperatures are respectively meant . An isothermal zone is the space comprised between two isothermal lines . 261 . CLIMATE. ? By the climate of a place are understood the whole of the meterological conditions to which a place is subjected , its mean annual temperature , summer and winter temperatures , and the extremes within which these are comprised . Some writers distinguish seven classes of climate according to their mean annual temperature ? a hot climate , from 30 ? to 25 ? C. ; a warm climate , - from 25 ? to 20 ? C. ; a mild climate , from 20 ? to 15 ? C. ; a temperate climate , from 15 ? to 10 ? C. ; a cold climate , from 10 ? to 5 ? C. ; a very cold climate , from 5 ? to zero ; and an arctic climate , where the temperature is below zero . Those climates , again , are classed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between the mean summer and winter temperatures does not exceed 6 ? to 8 ? . In the Canary // Islands the mean summer temperature is 23 ? .4 and that of winter 18 ? , so that the difference is less than 0 ? . Variable climates , such as those of Paris and London , where the difference amounts to from 16 ? to 20 ? ; and extreme climates , such as those of Pekin and New York , where the difference is much greater . Island climates are generally but little variable , as the temperature of the sea varies little ; and hence there is a great difference between a land and a sea climate . The former is characterized by it greater range of temperature than the latter . Thus the difference between the mean temperatures of summer and winter is 11 ? at Cherbourg , 15 ? at Paris , and 20 ? et Vienna , although they are practically in the same latitude . In the northeast of Ireland ice scarcely forms in winter , and the myrtle flourishes as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Konigsberg in Prussia , where the mean annual temperature is 5 ? C. , the range being from ? 3 ? .5 , the mean monthly temperature in January , to 13 ? .6 , that of July . Winter in Plymouth is not colder than in Florence or Montpelier , yet grapes do not flourish there in the open air ; for while they can stand a somewhat severe cold in winter , they require a hot summer to become ripe . In Irkutsk in Siberia , where the ground is constantly frozen at a depth of three feet , oats and rye can be grown , for the short but hot summer is sufficient to ripen them ; while in Iceland , where the mean annual temperature is much higher , and the cold in winter is inconsiderable , no cereals can be grown , for the low summer temperature is insufficient to bring them to maturity . The reason of this is that the land absorbs and radiates heat easily ; it thus becomes more easily heated and more rapidly cooled than the sea , which , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , on the other hand , does not part so soon again with the heat it has acquired . Again , part of the heat which falls on the sea is consumed in forming vapor on the surface . But the temperature is by no means the only characteristic which influences the climate of a place ; there is , in addition , the influence of aqueous vapor in the air in the neighborhood of seas , and particularly that of clouds , which are more frequent near coasts ; they temper the ardor of the sun by day , and diminish the loss of heat which the earth experiences by radiation at night . To these climatic influences must be added the quantity and frequency of rain , the number of storms , the direction and intensity of the winds , and the nature of the soil . 262 . Fens AND MISTS. ? When aqueous vapor , rising from a vessel of boiling water , diffuses in the colder air , it is condensed ; a ix NATURAL PHILOSOPHY Mort of cloud is formed , which consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain suspended in the air . These are usually spoken of as vapor , yet they are not so , at any rate not in the physical sense of the word ; they are , in reality , condensed vapor , but , from the minute weight of the individual particles in , comparison with their great surface , can not overcome the comparatively great resistance of the air , they sink very slowly , and are even driven upwards by the lightest current of air . When this condensation of aqueous vapor is not produced by contact with cold solid bodies , but takes place throughout large regions of the atmosphere , the effect is to form fogs or mists , which in fact are nothing more than the appearance seen over a vessel of hot water . A chief cause of fog consists in the moist ground being at a higher temperature than the air . Such fogs are of frequent occurrence in autumn . The vapors which then rise , condense and become visible . In all cases , however , the air must have reached its point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced when a current of hot and ' moist air passes over land or water at a lower temperature than its own , for then , the air being cooled , as soon as it is saturated , the excess of vapor present is condensed . In this way are formed the winter fogs . The distinction between mists and fogs is one of degree rather than of kind . A fog is a very thick mist . When water is coated with a layer of coal-tar , it is prevented from evaporating . Frankland ascribed the dry fog met with in London to the large quantities of coal-tar and paraffine vapor which are sent into the atmosphere , and which , condensing on the particles of fog , prevent their evaporation . Aitkin has shown that aqueous vapor never condenses unless some liquid or solid is present on which it is deposited . Particles of dust in the air which are always present though invisible are the nuclei for clouds and fogs . This he showed by passing steam into air which had been filtered by passing through cotton wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced under the same circumstances in unfiltered air . The density of the cloud was found to depend on the number of particles of dust in the air . A most ' abundant source of dust is the combustion of coal . The sulphur in the coal in burning also forms sulphurous acid , which , though a gas , is found to act as a nucleus , as in its formation it probably carries with it some excessively minute particles of unburnt sulphur . . 263 . CLOUDS. ? Clouds are masses of vapor condensed into water particles of extreme minuteness , like fogs and mists , from which // they differ only in occupying the higher regions of the atmosphere ; they always result front the condensation of vapor which rises from the earth or the sea . There is no essential difference between a fog and a cloud ; a cloud is a fog at a great height ; a fog is a cloud low down or on the ground . An observer in a valley sees the peak of a mountain inclosed by a cloud , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to their appearance , they have been divided by Howard into four principal kinds : the nimbus , the stratus , the cumulus , and the cirrus , These four kinds are represented in fig. 172 , and are designated respectively by one , two , three , or four birds on the wing . The cirrus consists of small whitish clouds , which have a fibrous or wispy appearance . The name of mares ' - tails , by which they are generally known , well describes their appearance . Of all clouds these are the highest , for they present the same appearance on the tops of high mountains as they do in valleys . Their height has been determined at about 27,000 feet . From the low temperature of the spaces which they occupy , it is more than probable that cirrus clouds consist of frozen particles ; and hence it is that halos , corona ; , and other optical appearances , produced by refraction and reflection from ice-crystals appear- almost always in these clouds NO NATURAL I ' 1111 , W4M ' 11Y end their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change of weather . Cumulus clouds are rounded forms which look like mountains , piled one on another , and are also known as woolpack cloud . They are more frequent in summer than in winter , and , after being formed in the morning , they generally disappear towards evening . If , on the contrary , they become more numerous , and especially if surmounted by cirrus clouds , rain or storms may be expected . Their height varies from 4,450 to 5,190 feet . Stratus clouds consist of very large and continuous horizontal sheets , which chiefly form at sunset , and disappear at sunrise . They are frequent in autumn and unusual in springtime , and are lower than the preceding . The height is about 680 yards . The stratus is generally a fine-weather cloud . The nimbus or rain clouds , which are sometimes classed as one of the fundamental varieties , are properly a combination of the three preceding kinds . They affect no particular form , and are solely distinguished by a uniform gray tint , and by fringed edges . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of one bird . Their height varies from about 3,600 to 7,000 feet . The fundamental forms pass into one another in the most varied manner ; Howard has classed these transitional forms as cirrocumulus , cirro-stratus , and cumulo-stratus , and it is often very difficult to tell , from the appearance of a cloud , which type it most resembles . The cirro-cumulus is most characteristically known as a " mackerel sky " ; it consists of small roundish masses , disposed with more or less regularity and connection . It is frequent in summer , and attendant on warm and dry weather . Cirro-stratus appears to result from the subsidence of the fibres of cirrus to a horizontal position , at the same time that they approach each other laterally . The form and relative position when seen in the distance frequently give the idea of shoals of fish . The tendency of cumulo-stratus is to spread , settle down into the nimbus , and finally fall as rain . The height of clouds varies greatly , being much higher in summer than winter . Gay-Lussac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet observed cirrus clouds above him , which appeared still to be at a considerable height . In Ethiopia M. d'Abbadie observed storm clouds whose height was only 690 feet above the ground . In order to explain the suspension of clouds in the atmosphere Halley supposed that clouds are formed of an infinity of extremely minute vesicles , hollow , like soap-bubbles , filled with air which is hotter than the surrounding air ; so that these vesicles float in the // air like so many minute balloons . At present it is held that clouds and fogs consist of extremely minute droplets of water , which are retained in the atmosphere by the occational force of currents of hot air , just as light powders are raised by the wind . Ordinarily , clouds do not appear to &seem!,; but this absence of down-ward motion is only apparent . In fact , clouds do usually fall slowly , but than the lower part is continually dissipated on coming in contact with the lower and men , heated layers : at the same time the upper part is always increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two actions clouds appear to retain the same height . A ( bald , indeed , is not something fixed and unchanging ; it exists only in its formation and in its cessation ; it is not a product , but a process . At night when there are no ascending currents the clouds do seem to fall . 264 . FORMATION OF CLOUDS. ? Many causes may concur in the formation of clouds . i . The low temperature of the higher regions of the atmosphere . For , owing to the solar radiation , vapor is continually being disengaged from the earth and from water , and from its small density rises in the atmosphere ; meeting there continually colder and colder layers of air , it becomes saturated , and then , condensing in extremely minute droplets , gives rise to clouds . ii . The hot and moist currents of air rising during the day undergo a gradually lower pressure , . and in expanding are cooled and the water vapor they carry with them is condensed . Hence it is that high mountains , arresting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are an abundant source of rain . iii . A hot , moist current of air mixing with a cold current undergoes a cooling , which brings about a condensation of the vapor . Thus the hot and moist winds of the south and southwest , mixing with the colder air of our latitudes , give rain . The winds of the north and northeast tend also , in mixing with our atmosphere , to condense the vapors ; but as these winds , owing to their low temperature , are very dry , the mixture rarely attains saturation , and generally gives no rain . 265 . RAIN. ? When the individual vapor particles become larger and heavier by the constant condensation of aqueous vapor , and when finally individual particles unite , they form regular drops , which fall as rain . At great heights raindrops are very small , but they become larger as they fall , for , from their low temperature , they condense on their surface the aqueous vapor of the layers of air through which they fall . The quantity of rain which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainfall , is measured by means of a rain-gauge or pluviometer. // The simplest form of rain-gauge consists of a funnel ( fig. 173 ) which has a certain definite area , 12 square inches for example , and which fits in a bottle . The rain which falls on this area is collected in the bottle , and the quantity which has fallen during Hut period of observation is measured by means of a graduated glass . Thus if It , ail p in 24 hours the quantity collected measures 2.3 fluid ounces , that is , 4 cubic inches , and if the area of the funnel is 12 inches , this represents a rainfall of one-third of an inch in 24 hours . The funnel and bottle are usually which is inclosed in a the funnel , which is taller to retain any snow which may fall . Many local circumstances may affect the quantity of rain which falls in different countries ; but , other things being equal , most rain falls in hot climates , for there the evaporation is most abundant . The rainfall decreases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under similar circumstances the quantity of rain diminishes with the distance from the sea , The rainfall increases with the height above the sea-level , for mountains produce rain when they arrest a current of moist air . An inch of rain on a square yard of surface represents 46.9 pounds , or 4.69 gallons . On an acre it corresponds to 22,900 gallons , or 101 tons . 100 tons per inch per acre is a ready way of remembering this . 266 . DEw . HOAR FROST. ? Dew is merely aqueous vapor which has condensed on bodies during the night in the form of minute globules . It is occasioned by the chilling which bodies near the surface of the earth experience iii consequence of the radiation at night . Their temperature having then sunk several degrees below that of the air , it frequently happens , especially in hot seasons , that this temperature is below that at which the atmosphere is saturated . The layer of air which is immediately in contact with the chilled bodies , and which has virtually the same temperature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as when a bottle of cold water is brought into a warm room it becomes covered with moisture , owing to the condensation of aqueous vapor upon it . According to this explanation , which , was first given by Dr. // ' Wells , all causes which promote the cooling of bodies increase the quantity of dew . These causes are the emissive power of bodies , the state of the sky , and the agitation of the air . Bodies which have a great radiating power become cool more readily , and therefore ought to condense more vapor . In fact , there is generally no deposit of dew on metals , whose radiating power is very small , especially when they are polished ; while the ground , sand , glass , and plants , which have a great radial ling power , become abundantly covered with dew . On some plants , for instance , not , merely are droplets of dew formed , but regular layers of water . The state of the sky also exercises a great influence on the formation of dew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send to the earth an inappreciable quantity of heat , while the earth radiates very considerably , and therefore , becoming very much chilled , there is an abundant deposit of dew . But if there are clouds , as their temperature is far higher than that of the planetary spaces , they radiate in turn towards the earth , and , as bodies on the surface of the earth only experience a feeble chilling , no deposit of dew takes place . Wind also influences the quantity of vapor deposited . If it is feeble , it increases it , inasmuch as it renews the air ; if it is strong , it diminishes it , as it heats the bodies by ' contact , and thus it does not allow the air time to become cooled . Finally , the deposit of dew is more abundant according as the air is moister , for then it is nearer its point of saturation . In those countries of the hot zones which are near the sea , dew may replace rain , as in Peru and Chili ; in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish between the dew formed in consequence of lowering of temperature by radiation , and the deposit formed by warm moist air passing over a cold wall ; in mild weather this deposit forms a liquid , and in severe weather a snowy or icy coating . A deposit of this kind is most abundantly found on good conductors , for they are the coldest . hoar frost and rime are nothing more than dew which has been deposited on bodies cooled below zero , and has therefore become frozen . The flocculent form which the small crystals present of which rime is formed shows that the vapors solidify directly without passing through the liquid state.Hoar frost , like dew , is formed on bodies which radiate most , such as the stalks and leaves of vegetables , and is chiefly deposited on the parts turned towards the sky . 267 . Snow . SLEET. ? Snow is water solidified in stellate crystals variously modified , and Heating in the atmosphere . These crystals // arise from the congelation of the minute particles which constitute the clouds , when the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more regular when formed in a calm atmosphere . Their form may be investigated by collecting them on a black surface , and viewing them through a strong lens . They exhibit exquisite regularity and at the same time variety of form . Fig. 174 shows some of the forms as seen through a microscope from the observations of Dr. Glaisher . It snows most in countries near the poles , or in such as are high above the sea-level . Towards the poles , the earth is constantly covered with snow ; the same is the case on high mountains , where there are perpetual snows even in equatorial countries . One foot of snow may , with sufficient accuracy , be taken as equal to one inch of rain . FIG. 174 . Sleet is also solidified water , and consists of small icy needles aggregated together in a confused manner . Its formation is ascribed to the sudden congelation of the minute globules of the clouds in an agitated atmosphere . When in consequence of severe frost the ground is cooled below zero and a thaw sets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture , which is converted into a continuous sheet of ice ; this is known as glazed frost ( the French verglas ) ; it may also occur when raindrops which have been cooled below zero in the higher regions of the air , and are accordingly in a state of superfusion , fall on the ground which may even be above the freezing-point . 268 . Hail  --  Hail consists of masses of compact ice of different sizes , which fall in the atmosphere . In our climate bail falls // principally during sprint. ; and summer , and at . the hottest times of the day ; it rarely falls at . night . The fall of hail is always preceded by a peculiar noise . Hail is generally the precursor of rain storms ; it seldom accompanies them , and follows them more rarely still , especially if the ruin lets lasted for some time . Hail clouds seem generally to be very low . The regions in which a hail storm occurs feral in most e : , e : a Lai ; ; narrow strip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of compressed snow , which is surrounded by concentric layers of ice . Hailstones fall from the size of small peas to that of a sphere two inches in ( Hanalei .. Their temperature is front ? 0.5 ? to ? 4 ? C. The formation of hail , and more especially the great size of hailstones , have never , been altogether satisfactorily accounted for . While snow sometimes falls for days together , hailstorms seldom last longer than a quarter of an hour , and they are also far less frequent . Hail is always accompanied by some electrical disturbance in the atmosphere . 269 . DIRECTION AND VELOCITY OF WINDS. ? Winds are currents moving in the atmosphere with variable directions and velocities . The direction of the wind is determined by means of vanes , and its velocity by means of the anemometer . There are several forms of this instrument . The most usual consists of a small vane with fans , which the wind turns ; the velocity is deduced from the number of turns made in a given time , which is measured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly used in this country , and represented in fig. 176 , is known as Robinson 's anemometer . It consists of a metal cross with hemispherical cups at the ends , and fixed to an axis . The motion of this cross is transmitted by means of an endless screw to a train of wheelwork ; and from the number of turns made in a given time , which is indicated by the pointers , the velocity of the wind is deduced . In our climate the mean velocity is from 18 to 20 feet in a second . With a velocity of 6 or 7 feet , the wind is moderate ; with 30 or 35 feet , it is fresh ; with 60 or 70 feet , it is strong ; with a velocity of 85 to 90 feet , it is a tempest , and from 90 to 120 it is a hurricane . The velocity of a wind may , under appropriate circumstances , be measured by observing the time which the shadow of a cloud takes to pass over a field , or any space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF WINDS. ? Winds are produced by a disturbance of the equilibrium in some parts of the atmosphere ? a disturbance always resulting from a difference in temperature between adjacent countries . Thus if the temperature of a certain extent of ground becomes higher , the air in contact with it becomes heated , it expands , and rises towards the higher regions of the atmosphere ; // whet tee it flows , producing upper currents which blow from hot to cold countries . But at the same time the equilibrium is destroyed at the surface of the earth , for the barometric pressure on the colder adjacent parts is greater than on that which has been heated , and hence a current will be produced with a velocity dependent on the difference between these pressures ; thus two distinct winds will be produced , an upper one setting outwards from the heated region , and a lower one setting inwards towards it . 271 . REGULAR , PERIODIC , AND VARIABLE WINDS. ? According to the more or less constant directions in which winds blow , they may be classed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regular winds are those which blow all the year through in a virtually constant direction . These winds , which are also known as the trade winds. , are , far from the land in equatorial regions , observed to blow uninterruptedly from the northeast to the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere , and from the southeast to the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere . They prevail on the two sides of the equator as far as 30 ? of latitude , and they blow in the same direction as the apparent motion of the sun ; that is , from east to west . The air above the equator , being gradually heated , rises as the sun passes round from east to west , and its place is supplied by the colder air from the north or south . The direction of the wind ; however , is modified by this fact : that the velocity which this colder air has derived from the rotation of the earth ? namely , the velocity of the surface of the earth at that point from which it started ? is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point at which it has now arrived ; hence the currents acquire , in reference to the equator , the constant directions stated above . ii . Periodic winds are those which blow regularly in the same direction , at the same seasons , and at the same hours of the day ; the monsoon , simoom , and the land and sea breeze are examples of this class . The name monsoon is given to winds which blow for six months in one direction , and for six months in another . They are principally observed in the Red Sea and in the Arabian Gulf , in the Bay of Bengal , and in the Chinese Sea . These winds blow towards the continents in summer , and in a contrary direction in winter . The simoom- is a hot wind which blows over the deserts of Asia and Africa , and is characterized by its high tem- // perature and by the sands which it raises in the atmosphere and carries along with it . During the prevalence of this wind the air is darkened , the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning thirst is experienced . This wind is launch under the name of sirocco in Italy and Algiers , where it blows from the great desert of Sahara . During its prevalence people remain at . home , the windows and doors being carefully closed . In Egypt , where it prevails from the end of April to June , it is called kansin , from n word signifying fifty ; for it lasts ordinarily 50 days ; 25 before the spring equinox , and 25 after . When caravans are surprised by this wind , men cover their fans with thick cloths and camels turn their buck to the torment . The natives of Africa , in order to protect themselves from the effects of the too rapid perspiration occasioned by this wind , cover themselves with fatty substances . The land and sea breeze is a wind which blows on the seacoast during the day from the sea towards the land , and during the night from the land to the sea . For during the day the land becomes more heated than the sea , in consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence , as the air above the land becomes more heated than that over the sea , it ascends and is replaced by a current of colder and denser air flowing from the sea towards the land . During the night the land cools more rapidly than the sea , and thus the same phenomenon is produced , but in the opposite direction . The sea breeze commences alter sunrise , increases to three o'clock in the afternoon , decreases towards evening , and is changed into the land breeze after sunset . These winds are only perceived at a slight distance from the shores . They are regular in the tropics , but less so in our climate ; and traces of them arc seen as far as the coasts of Greenland . They are even observed on the shores of such inland lakes as that of Constance ; and still more markedly in the great American lakes . The proximity of mountains also gives rise to periodic daily breezes . In like manner the open country is warmer during the day than an adjacent forest , while the reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a slight breeze from the forest towards the open , and during the day from the open country towards the forest . iii . Variable winds are those which blow sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another , without being subject to any law . In mean latitudes the direction of the winds is very variable ; towards the poles this irregularity increases , and under the arctic zone the winds frequently blow from several points of the horizon at once . On the other hand , in approaching the torrid zone they became more regular . 272 . LA W OF THE ROTATION OF WINNDS. ? Notwithstanding the great irregularity which characterizes the direction of the winds in our latitudes , it has been ascertained that the wind has a preponderating tendency to veer round according to the sun 's motion ; this is , to pass from north , through northeast , east , southeast , to south , and so on round in the same direction from west to north : that it often makes a complete circuit in that direction , or more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that it rarely veers and very rarely or never makes a complete circuit in the opposite direction . For a station in south latitudes a contrary law of rotation prevails . 273 . WEATHER CHARTS. ? A considerable advance has been made in weather forecasts by the frequent and systematic publication of weather charts ; that is to say , maps in which the barometric pressure , the temperature , the force of the wind , etc. , are expressed for considerable areas in an exact and comprehensive manner . A careful study of such maps renders possible a forecast of the weather for a day or more in advance . We can here do little more than explain the meaning of the principal terms in use . If lines are drawn through those places on the earth 's surface where the corrected barometric height at a given time is the same , such lines are called isobaromeiric lines , or , more briefly , isobaric lines , or isobars . Between any two points on the same isobar there MEI'l.:01t ( tt . ( Wilt ' . I. PHENOMENA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a difference of 1/15 of an inch . Suppose A and B to be points on two isobars , the pressure being greater at A than at B. I f AB be joined , and a line , A C , be drawn perpendicular to A B and of such a length as to represent on any suitable scale the di difference in pressure between the two places , the steepness of the line C , B or the ratio of C A to A B , is a measure o the fail in pressure between the two stations , and is called the borometric gradients . Gradients are usually expressed in England and America in hundredths of an inch of mercury for one degree of sixty nautical miles , and on the Continent in millimetres for the same distance . The closer are the isobars the steeper is tho gradient , and the more powerful the wind ; and though no exact numerical relationship can be proved to exist between the steepness of the gradient and the force of the wind , it may be mentioned that a gradient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradient of 10 , or a difference in pressure of TJ of an inch for 60 miles , is a stiff gale . The direction of the wind is from the place of higher pressure to that of lower , and in reference to this the law of Buys Ballot may be mentioned , which has been found to hold in all cases in the Northern Hemisphere , where local configuration does not come too much into play . If we stand with our back to the wind the line of lower pressure is on the left hand . For places in the Southern Hemisphere exactly the opposite law holds . If within any area the pressure is lower than outside it , the wind blows round that area , the place of lowest pressure being on the left . The direction of the wind is , in short , the opposite of that of the hands of a watch . Such a circulation is called cyclonic ; it is that which is characteristic of the West Indian hurricanes , which are known as cyclones . Conversely the wind blows round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of a watch ; and this circulation is called anticyclonic . Cyclonic systems are by far the most frequent , and are characterized by steep gradients ; the air in them tends to move in towards the centre , and thence to the upper regions of the atmosphere . They bring with them , over the greater part of the region which they cover , much moisture , an abundance of cloud , and heavy rain . Anticyclonic systems have the opposite characteristics ; the gradients are slight , and the wind is light . The air is dry , so that there is but little cloud , and no rain . Cyclonic systems , from the dampness of the air , produce warm weather in winter , and cold wet weather in summer . Anticyclonic systems bring our hardest frosts in winter and greatest heat in summer , as there is ' 270 NATURAL PIIILOSOPIIS " be it little moisture in the air to temper the extremes of climate .
