txt Bishop Potter traveled down here from Cooperstown yesterday to take part in the dedication of a saloon ' which he believes is of the sort that will be to the advantage of those who patronize it and a distinct aid to the solution of social problems in a city of many nationalities . In the pocket of the Bishop was a telegram from Asbury Park pleading with him to keep away from the saloon as an example and suggesting in 1:i0 prepaid words that his attendance on the occasion of the dedication of the Subway Tavern , at Bleecker and Mulberry Streets , would bring en uproar of disapproval from the good people of the country . Although he knew that the telegram was but the forerunner of a flood of protest , the Bishop was on hand . He has largely aided those whose plan it has been to open the saloon with a capitalization of $10,000 . It Is believed that it will pay a dividend of 5 per cent. , the additional profits to be used for the esetablishment of more saloons conducted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disregarded an attack of lumbago in coming down . A feature of this particular saloon is that its front room has a " sanitary soda water fountain where beer will be served to women if they prefer it to the fountain fluids . Over swinging doors that lead to the back room , or bar , is a painted injunction forbidding women to enter . As during the exercises no liquor or beer was sold over the bar . the women who had gathered to give their approval to the scheme were allowed to pass through . Unaccustomed to barroom fixings , they were at a loss as to how the doors were manipulated . The Bishop stood back to let the : ladles precede , when Joseph Johnson , Jr. , the Great Oak of the Order of Acorns , who devised " the ethical stimulant-selling ( - Stablishment. " showed them the way to the bar . Mr. Johnson explained that he was once a reporter , when he had to go into saloons to seek for news . The Bishop was then shown about the barroom. where he admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ' he World 's Fair in Chicago and elsewhere . It was lent to the saloon by Mrs. Amanda Brewster Sewell , the artist . Another one over the bar , by Mrs. Brewster 's husband , R. R. V. Sewell , and entitled " Pleasures of the Past . " shows a group of girls garbed in pastoral costumes . Both Mr. and Mrs. Sewell are interested in Settlement work . . Immediately under this picture was a half tone of Judge Parker , surrounded by an ermine frame. - Bishop-PtAter looked at ? this in an inquiring way . Mr. Johnson told him that he had bought it from a peddler for 10 cents . The Bishop looked in a reflective way at the row of bottles of whisky , gin , brandy , and other liquids , and remarked : NO POLITICS IN IT . " Young .

" After it was explained that no Roosevelt picture peddler had happened along , the manager of the place asked the Bishop if he cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , he said . Then he was led to the seat of honor at the reading table . There patrons of the place , between drinks , will have the best of literature at - their service . Above the Bishop was the sign " This Way 0 the Water Wagon " on the door leading to the soda fountain . It was necessary for him to turn his back on this to face the crowd that had gathered to hear the speechmaking . Maurice Tekulsky , ex-President of the Liquor Dealers ' Association , watched the Bishop with deep interest He had been accustomed to the attention of saloon crowds , and viewed the proceedings with an air of disapproval , which grew when he could not learn on inquiry what had been the cost of the various articles in stock . The place was well filled when the dedication exercises began . Mr. Johnson in his remarks introducing the speakers of the occasion outlined the work intended . The first object was to eliminate that profit in the liquor business which comes from the sale of inferior goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man could come into the Subway Tavern and use the place as a clubroom , look over the papers and magazines , order a beer or two , smoke his pipe or his cigar in the company of decent fellows where the treating obligation was absolutely discouraged . If one man wanted more than another man could stand he could satisfy his desires as long as he showed no sign of intoxication . If he seemed to be drinking more than an ordinary man should he would find that he could buy no more . Free luncheon of wholesome sort was to be a part of the programme . The saloon was to be conducted on the lines of the taverns in England , started by Lord Grey , whose object was to disassociate immorality from the drinking habit . THE TAVERN 'S OWNERS . In proof that his saloon was well conceived in the spirit of helping his fellowman . Mr. Johnson gave the names of its stockholders , whose President he is . J. J.

He said that the Americans had degraded the custom of drinking . The saloon , he said , was about the only place where poor men could gather , and that place ought to be made fit for decent men . Dr. David // BISHOP POTTER HELPS DEDICATE MODEL SALOON // Blaustein of the Educational Alliance followed Mr. Lamb . Then Bishop Potter was introduced . The place was crowded , and some of those in the rear tried to climb on the finely polished bar . Paul Archer , the barkeeper , repelled all such boarders , Bishop Potter said , in part : " Here is a community about us of 300 , - 000 people , which is a population greater than Albany or Troy . Dr. Blaustein would not have spoken about the paucity of the saloons here did he not know of what he spoke .

" The old plan in England was a system where liquor was sold by the State , the seller getting a percentage of what he sold . Lord Grey turned that around . In his system you can get tea , coffee , milk , or chocolate in such places , and the manager gets his profit on that . This plan recognizes the social aim . " In New York we have a great multitude of people . When the day is over what is to become of them ? I belong to many clubs to which I can go , but where can the toiler go ? The business man gets his luncheon at the Hardware or the Lawyers ' Club and it is all very nice , refined , and dignified . By inevitable necessity the others go to the saloon .

" The temperance question is as far from solution now as It was twenty years ago , with the addition that false methods have bred a large amount of hypocrisy . This is a movement that men absent to-day must take cognizance of , if they would save the Republic . " In the great cities we must make the home of the workingmen better , cleaner , and brighter . We must see that they have recreation , which takes men not away from but into closer relations with their families and children . " Concluding , Bishop Potter told of the Places in Europe where men went with their wives and children to hear good music and to eat and drink according to their means , and trusted that The Subway Tavern would have such a clientele . The exercises ended with the singing of the Doxology , those in the gathering who did not know the words doing their best . As the Bishop was driven away the bar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . BABBITT PROTESTS . Disapproves Earl Grey Saloons  --  Questions Bishop 's Judgment . The Rev. Dean Richmond Babbitt , rector of the Church of the Epiphany , in Brooklyn , was among the first to notify Tam NEW YORE TIKES of his disapproval of the course of Bishop Potter in attending the dedication of a saloon and addressing those assembled in the place . Dr. Babbitt said :  - -  . ' personally , with all my reverence for Bishop Potter , formerly my Bishop and one who ordained me to the diaconate and the priesthood , and with great admiration for his scholarship , courage , and civic force , I utterly dissent from him and his temperance confreres in this matter , for these reasons : ? " First , as the scheme is outlined by the director , Mr. Johnson , it undermines , neutralizes , and even destroys temperance sentiment by adopting and sanctioning the public sale of spirituous liquors for profit , such liquors to be used as a beverage . After all these years of education in temperance sentiment , by which at least Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeper as an injury to his fellow-men , it does not seem to be quite the thing for Christian men to throw overboard this great , restraining , often prohibitive Christian temperance sentiment , by becoming saloon keepers and proprietors themselves , and that , too , on a business basis of 5 per cent . returns on Investments . When thousands of men and even women under the almost overwhelming temptation to drink and ruin are held back by a mere gossamer thread , and that , too , an issue from Christian opinion , just strong enough in their cases to keep them out of saloons , but in other . cases , strung as a cable . it looks like overturning the arduous work of decades of temperance work . " Second , it throws over the principles of true temperance in that the eystern invites to a public place , a saloon , in order to drink , and adds to the attractions of the ordinary saloons better liquor and cheaper prices , and with as many other attractions to help bring in the wayfarer as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Granted that the main impulse to enter these moral drinking houses is the desire of drink , then the plan is to get as many to drink pure , cheap wine , beer , and even whisky , as all attractions above the . regular competing saloon can affect . It admits the right of the saloon , and goes it many better in attractions and pure liquor , sells honest , and does not poison as much . I can not see that the establishment of this Earl Grey system betters temperance , but I do say I think . that it may do much injury . "
