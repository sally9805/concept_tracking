txt According to the Treasury 's May statement , the monetary circulation increased $43,745,515 over the previous month , and $142,243,017 over a year ago . The total is a record at $2,720 ; 250,203 , or $32.22 per person . The increase for the month is mainly in gold , owing to the Treasury 's help to importers , but the increase for the year is mostly in National banknotes . For the month the increase in banknotes is $.1 , GSS , 743 , but for the year the Increase is S7 ( ,375,412 . Surely this is a substantial help to a difficult situation . It is a help , but less help than the same resources would have afforded if applied differently . The banknotes have been obtained only by the use of an equal amount of capital expended in bonds . The banks might have loaned what the bonds cost as well as loaned the notes issued upon the bonds . The difference in the two operations is one of profit and convenience , not of any considerable difference of loaning power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reserves as legal tenders , or'as gold ? There would have resulted a triple power of extending credit , but no power of issuing currency . The banknotes issued against the bonds are not legal reserves , but they are issuable to any one willing to take merely currency , and having no use for reserve money . Thus the National banknotes , although not reserve money , enable the bank to use as reserves legal tenders which otherwise they might be compelled to use as mere currency . But there is no power of issuing banknotes upon gold , and there is no requirement of redemption of banknotes in gold . They are I edeemable in " lawful money , " that is , In saver or In greenbacks . Gold may be got for either from the Treasury , but that . does not alter the fact that the banks may tender silver , and the idea is obnoxious . The redemption of +544,765 , - 359 National banknotes in $337,130,321 of United States notes is a double absurdity . It is a survival from the teriod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the growth of the banknote system was unforeseen , and when it was not appreciated that exchange of paper for paper was not payment . These facts are suggestive in connection , with the Chamber of Commerce movement for reform . If the committee 's twenty-seven questions give a clue to their course of thought , they are tending toward recommending the issue of a ninth sort of currency , by some sort of a bank different from the ' National banks . It seems to us that we have already too many sorts of banks , 1 and too many kinds of " money . " It 1 would be simpler , and more in accord with approved banking , if gold were substituted for bonds as a basis of cur-1 rency issued by existing banks . 01 .. , if that is too radical , bond security might be retained as guarantee for ultimate payment , and with concession of using as reserve money some portion of the notes upon condition of providing a gold fund to assure convertibility . As the matter stands , a half billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If this is impracticable of abolishment , at least it might be amended . In some way more money ought to be got into the banks . In the last eight years the percentage of reserves to loans has declined from over 20 per cent . to under 13 per cent . The is a waste of bank-ing power as the matter stands . And there ought to be some way of providing currency without disturbing bank reserves .
