THE wandering American finds it difficult to think of Italy as a modern state , a member df the club of European nations , which , after the method of fashionable clubs , has an impolite contempt for all who do not belong to it , and also allows little acts of rudeness among its members . All the mechanism of the Italian kingdom looks like stage furniture , hurriedly got ; it seems as far from modern American life as her castled hills or the angels fluttering in Perugino 's pictures . What have the Po , hurrying " to seek peace , " the Arno , and the Tiber to do with winter wheat , Federal Steel Companies , or Edison 's discoveries ? Italian politics and ours have nothing , in common . The sea of Italians is the Mediterranean , waters of the past , while we splash in the Atlantic and Pacific . They concern themselves with France , Austria , and , Spain , whereas we challenge England , Germany , and Russia . They seem like schoolboys in the fortis below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , their muscles less vigorous , their sinews feebler , than ours . Modern Italy is almost as far away from us as Italy of the Renaissance . A land where the people are so polite that they will take great trouble for you and add their thanks , where all the coal is imported , where the churches are shut during the middle of Sunday because the clay is a festa , where D ' Annunzio is acclaimed as a glory to his country , where to save is esteemed as respectable as to spend , where senators are appointed for their literary achievements , where the main industry is to provide food anhodging for temporary immigrants , ? such a land , with its cathedrals , loggias , and pictures , seems the fiction of a story-teller . To themselves the Italians are intensely modern . They have a young kingdom ; the unity of Italy is their era ; the great actors have left the stage , but many risen remember those glorious days , the beginnings of a new Italy , and no they deem themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the plot is laid not long before Magenta and Solferino , II Piccolo Mon-do Antico , The Little World of Old . The murder of Umberto Primo has given them a young king , who sits upon his throne very gallantly . Not much was known about him till last August , except that he had a strong will and was a learned collector of coins . It is not easy to judge a king in the blaze of that fierce light of falsehood that beats upon a throne , but a short speech which he then made to the senators and deputies gives a clue to his character . He said : " Trembling , but confident , I mount the throne , with a consciousness of my rights and duties as king . Let Italy have faith in me , as I have faiths in the destinies of our country , and no human power shall have strength to destroy that which our fathers have wrought with such great self-denial . It is necessary to be vigilant and to use all our might to preserve inviolate the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in serene confidence in our free institutions , and I shall neves , fail in effort and energy of action vigorously to defend our country 's glorious constitution , the priceless heritage from our forefathers . " The young king and his ministers have a hard time before them ; there are many knotty problems to be thought out . In the first place , there is the miserable question of livelihood . Italy paces to and fro , like an ambitious poor mass with a large family , not knowing what to do . In her alliance with Germany and Austria , Italy has bargained to keep many thousands of soldiers ready to take the field : that army costs a great deal of money , though less for each soldier than in the other European armies , and not more than half as much as in the French army . Such expense means heavy taxes many people are not able , and massy are not willing , to pay them . In the south of Italy there has been great distress ; insects and bad weather have made fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some districts have been compelled by distress to petition the government for remission of taxes and for help of various kinds . The bread which the peasants eat in the country south of Naples is food for horses . The Socialists , a small party , scattered about in the big cities , demand that thin Triple Alliance ; military establishment , battleships and cruisers , be given up , and taxes lessened : many poor people , some landowners and professors of political economy , think with them on this question . Moreover , the commercial treaties which Italy has with Germany and Austria will have run their course in a year or two , and this anti-military party demands that Italy refuse to renew the Triple Alliance , unless the other two countries will agree not to lay heavy duties upon Italian agricultural products . But north of the Alps there are contrary ideas on this matter . German farmers wish to have German markets to themselves , and the Kaiser wishes to keep the farmers obedient ; and therefore , in Italy , a noisy murmur is abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make an alliance with France and Russia . The majority , however , if one can be sure in the storm of ayes and noes , are resolute that Italy shall renew the Triple Alliance , that the great sacrifices which she has made shall not be rendered vain . They say that France is very hostile , and would seek any pretext to dismember Italy , and that an alliance with France and Russia would cost quite as much as the Triple Alliance . They argue that Germany will not put a high tariff upon Italian agricultural products , because she would be afraid of a retaliatory tariff ; for her manufacturers export 520,000,000 worth of goods into Italy annually , and would cry as laud as her farmers do now . Out of these difficulties Socialists , Republicans , and politicians try to obtain advantage ; the poor express their opinions of taxation by an occasional riot or strike , but the laboring classes have little political influence . An American is constantly surprised by the imperfect organization of workingmen into labor unions , and by the slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some little exaggeration , the Italians are one hundred years behind-hand . This attitude of the Italian pub-lic , is due to the division into classes . With no there are social divisions into rich and poor , and we are not surprised that the descendants of a rich . man become day laborers , or that the grandson of a laborer becomes rich and respected ; but in Italy the incapable grandson of a noble is noble still , and the descendants of a peasant are pressed down and kept peasants by the whole force of society . Peasants are expected to remain poor , uneducated , and dirty ; education and opportunity are given to them , if at all , as charity , not as rights . The progress of democracy , in the sense of equal education and equality of opportunity , is hindered also by the differences between the north and south of Italy . The men of Piedmont and Lombardy are of a different race from the men of the south : they have different ideas , different conceptions of law , labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maine and the cotton planters of South Carolina , and therefore there can not be a general united movement throughout the peninsula , whether democratic , socialist , educational , or whatever else it may be . The north arts alone ; the middle of Italy , with its indifferent Romans , acts alone ; and the south acts fitfully by itself . Thus privileges are able to maintain themselves in greater permanence than with us ; even a strong and unselfish central government could not get a united public opinion throughout the country to support reforms . Another difficulty , not so immediate as revenue , but more persistent , is the Church . It astonishes an outsider to see how the Church clings to its claim for temporal power ; the claim is so childish , so stupid , so unspiritual . Question a good Catholic , and he will say : " Since the reign of Constantine , when Christianity became the state religion of the empire , temporal power harS been the means by which the Church has been free and independent of secular domination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the divine scheme for the maintenance of the Church , some other method will now be adopted : we crumot tell . We see a means over fifteen hundred years old : it is our duty , it is the Pope 's sworn duty , not to abandon that means . Moreover , to-day , members of the universal Church , Frenchmen , Germans , Irish , Spaniards , must have some certain guarantee that the Italian government will not interfere in the affairs of the Church ; how can they be sure that an ecclesiastical edict does not express the will of a Gavotsr or a Crispi ? " The question of papal sovereignty has undoubtedly been settled not so much by the union of Italy as by the opinion of enlightened Catholic laymen all over the world , which acknowledges that temporal and spiritual matters must be kept separate . The station master at Pmstum ex-plained to me that Italy suffered from three evils , ? the government , the gen-try , and the Clmrch . He said that the deputies squabbled and struggled for pri-vate gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the peasants , and squandered the money in idleness and dissipation ; and that the priests took no heed save to fill their bellies and keep their feet warm . I had heard similar opinions concerning the Chamber of Deputies and the aristo-cracy , and I bad been told many things about the priests , and I wished to talk further on these matters ; bust as the trails was due , I contented myself with express-ing the high respect which I entertained for the Pope . He replied that he had none ; his reason was that he bad been acolyte in the cathedral at Perugia when " Papa Pecci " was bishop there , long be-fore his election to the papacy . I judged that the station master was inclined to pessimism ; he held a mean opinion of the people of Paestum , and deemed him-self degraded by his southern post . Per-haps the ruins of the temple of Neptune made all things else look petty by comparison . At the time I thought him an atheist , but perhaps he was a pagan , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political entity here , and it is hard to judge it as a religious body . No two men seem fully to agree . There are few Protestants in Italy , and educated men who have become agnostics or infidels are inclined to observe the ceremonies of the Church ; the population therefore appears to be all Catholic , divided into adherents of the papacy and adherents of the government . The stanchest supporters of the latter proclaim themselves good Catholics , but they add that the Church must concern itself with spiritual matters only . Opinions about the Church are as plentiful as blackberries . There is the devout papist , who speaks of the terrible trials of the Church to-day , and of the wicked robberies by the government . Then there is the intelligent Catholic , who thinks that the Church should say as little as possible on matters of science , and the young bourgeois Catholic , who suspects that men do not confess all their doings to the priest . There is the liberal Catholic , who thinks that the Church is a living thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good and great body ; or maybe be despairs of the Church unless help shall come from America ; for America is the bright spot on the Catholic horizon , and the best Catholics ? in Italy hope that that brightness may mean dawn . In Rome itself , the impressions of the Church that crowd in upon a foreigner , as he wanders about , are very confusing . He goes into church after church : there is an old beggar at every door ; within masses are mumbled , like " aisle , manna , mona , mike ; " be-Baedekered strangers are moving wearily about ; and if there be a famous image of the Madonna , it is surrounded by a kneeling crowd , a mass of votive offerings , and children running to catch toddling babies . The Prates- tact residents of Rome , who attend the English and American churches , assure the visitor that the Roman Curia is a corrupt ring , Cardinal Rampolla a double-dealing politician , the Pope an old man who winks at far too much , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the fashion of the expatriated . The next day the American perhaps will receive a visit from a man in long black dress , edged maybe with a little purple braid ; his stature short , his body of a certain infantile rotundity , and his smooth-shaven face also of an infantile quality ; but there is , too , a firmness in the chin , and a touch of resolution about the lips . This gentleman speaks in tolerable French , with a charming politeness which is oddly different from the politeness of the world . He declines an invitation to dinner , ? the rules of his order do not permit , ? but he is most willing to take a cup of tea without cream or sugar . He is not much interested in general subjects of conversation ; he does not read the news . But if , in an endeavor to draw him out , mention is made of St. Francis or of St. Gregory , or in some way the right chord is struck , his eyes brighten , his cheeks color , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his whole being suddenly pours forth thanks for the great benefits that he has received from the dead saint . This man gets up at four o'clock in the summer , at five in the winter , and spends all day , with short intervals for prayer , in devotion to his routine interests , ? a monastery in the Abruzzi , a nunnery in Palermo , a poor family in Via Coronari , new sacristan , choristers , schoolboys and schoolgirls , besides a home for old women and a hospital for the blind . He detests Roman society , disapproves of Zola , has never heard of D ' Annunzio , admires America , likes a free country , and thinks that Protestants have their own way of finding the road to heaven . Perplexed whether to think this man an exception to the general , the foreigner goes to St. Peter 's on one of the last days of the Anno Santo . The basilica is crowded with pilgrims : there arc troops of Bavarians , companies of Irish , bands of peasants from Lombardy and Tuscany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young priests from Belgium , France , and Portugal , travelers from everywhere , dignified English clergymen and their brethren of the American Protestant Episcopal Church , careful not to overstep the line that fences off the polite and enlightened on-looker . The hour fixed for the Pope to come is long past , and every one is weary . Suddenly from the doors comes a noise ; then a slow procession winds up the passageway of ropes , and a storm of " Viva ! Viva ! II Papa Re ! Pa-pa Re ! " keeps pace with the march . There the Pope sits , carried above the heads of the people , his aged face looking serene , as if he had lived through shrewdness into wisdom , and through policy into charity , ? a kind old man , not unmindful of the true meaning of his title , Vicar of Christ . In the Roman streets there are troops of theological students ? come from all over Christendom , to be kept for five years in absolute ignorance of the world , and educated on Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the Propaganda to their dormitory , or perhaps to the Pincio for fresh air . Then there is the fat , unhealthy-looking priest , not well shaven , and unwilling to look you in the eye ; the preacher who warns women to keep themselves to household affairs , shunning education , literature , and more than all politics ; and a thousand others who fill the mind with a confused notion of what the Church is . One thing comes out clear : that it is the duty of every man to judge it justly , and then to work either for or against it . It is too tremendous a machine for us to sit indifferent . The American is puzzled by the parental and pedagogical attitude of the deleted material // lacks the very qualities that a foreigner expects , ? conciseness , lightness , and dramatic force . The Italy which a traveler comes to see , the Italy of the Renaissance , both in art and personality , is so romantic that it seems to have been chiefly created to hold up a mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveling in this heritage of opportunity . The Italian nature , quick in action , violent in passion , ready in sympathy , grave and gay , looks the personification of the Tragic and the Comic Muse . But the stage has never appealed to Italian men of genius . Students , men of letters , gather themselves together and force their way through the early comedies ; for , like everything else , modern comedy seems to have begun in Italy , and to have been transplanted to other countries . There are certain literary reputations , ? Alfieri , Metastasio , Carlo Goni ; there is also one Pietro Cossa , to whom the Romans have put up a statue and a marble tablet to tell the passer-by that his plays are immortal . In truth , there has never been but one Italian playwright , Carlo Goldoni . He is a marvel of dexterity : he takes the most trivial episodes , conversations , characters , light as froth , mixes them , flavors them , arranges them , and presto ! rolls up the curtain , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful little comedy . Men and women touched by the weariness of life like their drama more highly flavored , plots freighted with greater seriousness , laughter more partisan , tears more bitter ; but they who like to get warm in the sunshine of life , simple folk , fond of mirth , sparkling if shallow , of situations which can not unravel into unhappiness , of a world all grace and carelessness , find their recreation in Goldoni . The brilliant Buse sometimes plays La Locandiera or Pamela , but Goldoni has found a more passionate admirer in Ermete Novelli . This actor has taken a theatre on a little street // off the Corso Vittorio Emmanuele , in Rome , and has devoted his rare talents to the creation of a Casa di Goldoni on the model of the Maison de Moli4e . He has finished the first season of his experiment ; he has played for five months , acting half the time in Italian plays , and the other half in foreign plays , commonly translations from the French . One charm of his theatre is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre lover can go night after night , each time to a new play . The theatre is very pretty , resplendent with red plush and electric lights ; the prices are most comfortable , ? a seat in the front of the pit costs four francs . Except for Goldoni , the best plays are from the Prench . The dullness of Italian plays , even those of Ferrari , a name well known in Italy , is wonderful no plot , no humor , no character ; an insipid medley of personages , talking as if to hold the floor for the requisite three hours . But no dullness daunts Novelli ; this mobile face looks mean , intelligent , noble , pathetic , or petulant , out of the worst play as well as out of the best . It must be his confidence in his own ability to lug on his back the fo ? lornest of plays that makes loin so blind in his selection ; or it may be that , with a new bill every night , there are not enough good plays to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring-Mg out Italian plays is his passionate desire to uplift the Italian drama . He is inspired with the feelings of the Risorgimento , and headstrong for a national Italian drama . He is as gallant with his countrymen 's comedies as Garibaldi at Aspromonte . He spares no look , attitude , or motion , to retrieve the most disastrous evening . I like him best when he depicts some feeble character . 011 , the irresolution in his legs and the vocabulary of his shoulders ! They show forth hope , doubt , despair , expectation , benevolence , sympathy , incompetence , stupidity , irritation , alarm , timidity , effrontery , and forty meanings more . No. 34 A Letter front Italy . velli plays tragedy , too . In Tourgeniev 's story of The Bread of Others , he enacts the tragic part of a poor old country gentleman , who is made tipsy by some fellows from St. Petersburg ; the fumes of wine pass elf , and , in his anger at the insult put upon him , he bursts forth with a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy old rustic into the tipsy reveler , and then into the gentleman hot with anger , make a memorable scene . On the opening night of the Casa di Goldoni the theatre was crowded . Novelli played 11 Barber ? Benefice . After the curtain fell he was called out amid a storm of applause . lie spoke of the inferiority of the Italian stage in comparison with that of other countries , and attributed the inferiority to the fact that in Italy a theatrical company had no settled home , but wandered a vagrant from theatre to theatre ; he thought that the Lest he could do for the drama would be to form a stock company , and establish a theatre is Rome for the common good of the stage and of the public . Then he spoke of Goldoni , and said : " The immortal Babbo Papa of our comedy died hungry in a garret , far From his native land ; and for that reason the idea canoe to me of taking the paste Casa di Goldoni , ' that it - might be of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death he might have a home in his own country . " The words were sincere . Carlo Goldoni may rejoice that his plays have a worthy interpreter ; it may be that Iris pleasant soul , weary of Elysian fields , has migrated and become incarnate in the delightful actor , and that his speech was another bit of comedy . Excepting Verga 's Cavalleria Rustieana , the only plays of note in recent years are those written by D ' Annunzio , La Gioconda and La Cittis Morta . Duse and the famous tragic actor Zacconi act these platys to patchwork audiences , ? people of fashion , dissipated young gentlemen , dissipated old gentlemen , curious foreigners , innocent American girls ignorant of the language , and a claque . The Dead City begins at half past eight , and ends at one . There are five , six , or seven acts , maybe more , with long monologues and dialogues , and but four characters , ? four pennyworth of personages to this intolerable deal of talk . The great actress goes from city to city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triumph in the most undramatic of plays . Her face in itself is a tragedy , and could carry an audience through forty thousand of D ' AIIIIMIZi0 ' 6 lines . D ' Annunzio himself says of the play " I am sure that sonic melodies in my tragedy , independent of the literal signification , will ring in men 's souls whether they be cultivated or crude . I am sure that the greater past of the spectators from the beginning will recognize the unusual breadth of treatment in my work , and of its own accord will place itself in a position for forming a judgment that I may call uncommon . The first words that will resound in the silence of the theatre are words of Sophocles . I have faith in the potency of this introduction . The spectators will see , not a representation , but a transfiguration of life . When I compose a drama , I am in the way of truth , I believe , because I follow the teaching of the greatest masters . Some one will say , But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Such an one shows that he does not understand what tragic art really is , nor what art is . It is time to make a breach in the mass of prejudice that walls us in on every side . It is time to reestablish the privileges of poetry . The Dead City , which seems a work of attentive reflection , is the most spontaneous of my works , as it is undoubtedly the most original of any creations . I have written it in forty days , with an ease unusual to me , for I work laboriously . For this reason I am fond of it , and it seems to me that it ought to live . " Nevertheless , The Dead City was not a success in Paris , Milan , or Bologna ; it is three years old , and holds the stage through the genius of the great actress . D ' Annunzio himself is writing poems , ? an ode to Verdi , is poem to Garibaldi . Of the latter the poet says : " ' This canzone , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poetry , the epic and the lyric , is not so much intended to be read from the silent pages as to be listened to by an untrammeled multitude . It needs , in order to fulfill its full musical life , to come forth from the sonorous mouth of the speaker . At Turin , at Milan , at Florence , the assembled people gathered it in from the voice of the poet ; and the great clamor of the people filled the intervals between the stanzas . " In view of the poet 's explanation , it was to be expected that , reading the poem in the silent pages , I did not find it very interesting . It is hard to tell what Italians think of D ' Annunzio . His last novel , Fire , has caused very much talk . The story , as a whole and in its parts , is forbidden by every rule that affects the conduct of an American gentleman , and shuts us out from the right of criticism . Many people hate D ' Annunzio , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; some say that his much-praised style is mere tinsel ; others ad/nit that there is an element of poetry in his work , but think that he has exhausted it ; his admirers are a band of young men who cry him up as a great poet . I tried to explain to a young Italian a Yankee opinion of D ' Annunzio , and that in our country he would not be allowed to land ; that he would be smothered in the hold , or thrown overboard , or whitewashed and returned . He looked at me , and said : 5 ' You Americans do n't care for poetry . We Italians love it ; we love the stars , flowers , music , and poetry . " The two most interesting men of letters are Carducci and Fogazzaro . The great poet is old and broken , and Fogazzaro has disappointed the public with his last novel , Piccolo Mondo Moderno , The Little World of To-Day . its predecessor , The Little World of Old , was so charming , so skillfully composed , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the reader had to pick his way through a north dialect , ? and so interesting , that expectation was very curious for this novel , which is a kind of continuation of the first . The story concerns the son of the hero and heroine of The Little World of Old ; but who that is interested in a mother takes as keen an interest in her son ? Iv . An American is always impressed by the way in which the past keeps its hand heavy upon Italy . Here , more than in Germany , England , or France , the present is governed by preceding centuries . In Rome the Church still sits like " the ghost of the Roman Empire . " Italy , in spite of her young kingdom and 1151 ' hopes , is always struggling , not how best to do this thing or that , but to extricate herself from the yoke of the past . As one travels through Tuscany and Umbria , or between Rome and Naples , and watches from the train the little towns , walled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built for strongholds , the peasants pruning the olive trees , the friars tramping bareheaded along the road , everything looks as if it might step back four hundred years without the slightest inconvenience . Monk and peasant would not know the difference , and the towns would be cheered to have their citizens safe within the gates by nightfall . The bricks and stones of the fifteenth century are despots ; they trammel and subdue the energy of the young generations . Sons live in their fathers ' houses , as their fathers had lived before them ; they cook in the same kitchens , climb the same stairs , sleep in the same beds , and enjoy the same lack of linen ; they keep the same habits , they celebrate the same festivals ; with a happy resignation ? " Che vuole ? ills h padrone " ? they must submit to the divine decree . It is touching to read by the street names bow fresh the breath of the Risorgimento swept over these little towns . Young men and boys left their homes to join Garibaldi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bounteous and beautiful . After fighting was over , every municipality , shouting Eeeiva ! " gave its old streets the new heroic names , Corso Vittorio Emmen uele , Piazza Garibaldi , Via Cavour , Via Venti Settembre . Then the passion of the time died down ; the young soldiers turned bark into peasants , like their fathers , and found it as hard as ever to make enough for both bread and taxes . But the material parts of the past ? the little old houses , the ancient walls , the steep and crooked streets , the churches and monasteries ? are not the greatest hindrance to the Italy of to-day ; rather the social ills , especially in the south , handed down from a misgoverned , uneducated , selfish past . In Naples , the largest city in Italy , where according to the saying all men are rascals or saints , there remains the Camorra . How to root it out is one of the chief moral problems Ilefore Italy . The Camorra is a social scurvy , caused by lack of fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , or entertain for it the friendly feeling for familiar things ; their fathers belonged to it or were accustomed to it , and their grandfathers likewise . The Camorra is to them an organ of society , like the law or the Church . It spreads here and there underground , reaching from the lowest strata of society up , some say , to the highest . The great interest for Americans is the light it throws upon similar social phenomena in New York city . Nobody knows when the Camorra began , but it appears to have taken its present shape as a definite organization in the beginning of the last century . At that time it had grades , officers , laws , ? all the machinery of a social body . Among the police archives there is the written report of a trial held in 1820 , where a member of the Camorra was tried before a recognized tribunal of the society . This court was known as the " Gran Mamma . " One Giovanni Esposito had murdered a chief of the Camorra ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought before his judges and examined . The prisoner admitted the killing , but pleaded drunkenness as a defense . At the close of the examination one of the judges ( using some slang ) said : " For me as well as for my companions , further questions are useless ; the accused here present is confessedly guilty ; but if we wish to deliberate seriously , it is well to take him farther away . The assassin was removed to a distance . The statute , Mr. Superior and dear companions , if I am not mistaken , speaks plainly : it says , he who kills a superior must be killed ; the secretary can verify this article . If we do n't give an example of justice , this Society may call itself done for , and the respect for the Greater and Less Society the higher and lower grades of the Camorra becomes a dead letter . " After some discussion ( for one of the judges held that intoxication was a good excuse ) the prisoner was condemned . " As the will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against all the others , is for the condemnation to death of Heart-and-Dog secret name of Giovanni Esposito , because on the evening of ? , without cause , he killed our superior , therefore we order and command the two young men who arrested him to kill him with two knife thrusts in the breast . " In this document , for the sake of secrecy , all names are represented by pictured signs . A young woman , however , in love with Heart-and-Dog , notified the police , and saved her lover . The purpose of the society is livelihood by blackmail . The system of organized blackmail is said to have originated in the prisons . The habitats used to levy tribute upon newcomers , coin . pelling them to give money to buy oil for the Virgin , and for various pious and other uses . This practice grew ; and when the convicts had served their terms , they continued the same system , only to better advantage , outside the walls . Out of such beginnings a society was evolved , and became by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two preliminary grades before a youth could become a camorrista ; there were officers of different ranks , and tine districts of the city were assigned to local branches of the society . The conditions of Naples made the way easy for this organized system of blackmail . Idleness is put upon the people by the soil and climate ; for four cents a man can breakfast on macaroni , bread , and fruit . The government had been bad for hundreds of years , and under the Jesuit-ridden Bourbons it became worse than ever , with no purpose except to root out liberal thought and to maintain itself in comfortable power ; it made no attempt to suppress the Camorra . So the Camorra developed and flourished , and , with some change in its methods , enjoys vigorous life to-day . A Camorrista , a full-fledged member of the society in good standing , is a kind of bully , who makes a livelihood from the labor of others ; he levies tribute on all the people lie can , especially on the most degraded class of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and protects them . For instance , in the days of the Bourbons ( old instances are good to-day ) , not long after Napoleon 's overthrow , one of the streets of the city was notoriously bad ; various police regulations had been made in vain , and the decent people of the neighborhood petitioned the municipal officers to wall up the street in such a way that it might be shut off and its inhabitants locked in at night . The officer with whom the final decision rested received the following anonymous letter : ? NAPLES , September , 1809 . Sent , ? Are you not aware that in confining these poor girls in walls you act as if they were condemned to tine lowest depth of hell ? ' line prefect of police and the intendant who order this brutal act have no heart ; but you who have to decide , whom nobody can oppose , ought to do justice to these poor girls , and prevent their being walled up like wild beasts . For years there has been a plan like that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your predecessors thought best to execute it ; because if those poor unfortunates have no relations to get justice for them , we are here who have much heart and are always ready to shed our own blood for diem , and to cut tine throats of those who shall do anything toward walling up that street . With all humility I kiss your hands . N. N. The official decided not to build the wall . Many years afterwards such a wall was built , and ins course of time fell into disrepair . The work of rebuilding was begun , but at night whatever had been built by clay was pulled down . This happened several times . The head of the police summoned tine Camorrista within whose jurisdiction the street lay , and threatened him with exile if the work should be interfered with again . There was no further trouble . As things were then they are to-day . Round the prostitutes gathers a gang of ruffians : these ruffians have a large circle of acquaintances , who , for peace and a quiet life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neapolitans sympathize with them against the police , and vote as they direct . The control of votes is political power . The Camorra , naturally , is ready to support candidates for office who will not interfere wills its habits of life , and officials are also ready to accept its support , winking and blinking in return . The whole system was revealed in the famous trial held at Naples last autumn . A Socialist newspaper , La Propaganda , accused Casale , a famous politician , one of the deputies from Naples , of political corruption , in that he had used his influence and place for the advantage of his henchmen and for private gain . The accusation was such as the New York Evening Post has made a hundred times against the leaders of Tammany Hall . Casale brought suit for libel . For defense the newspaper pleaded the truth of its accusations . The case was tried after the Latin fashion , before judges , without a jury . Casale brought various witnesses to testify to his good charac- ter the mayor of Casale 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a senator and several commendatbres declared that Casale 's conduct had been correct in all the offices lie had held . Then the defense produced its evidence . One by one , various witnesses , many of them connected with the city government , testified that Casale had recommended for employment by the city men who had been charged with crime ; that places in the city departments had to be found for Casale 's friends ; that offices were said to be bought and sold ; that creditors of the city were not paid promptly by the cashier unless they presented a recommendation from Casale ; that Casale , going to represent the city at a celebration held in honor of Garibaldi , took with him two ladies , a secretary , a journalist , and two young men , and charged the whole bill to the city ; that justice found many impediments and hindrances in seeking to lay hold of Casale 's friends ; that , when commissioner of the Octroi , for a bribe of 2000 francs he approved one tariff rather than another ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received from a steamship company 30,000 francs , and from a street railway company , in return for a favorable contract , he and two friends hail received 60,000 francs ; and finally , that Casale was the city gov- ernment , for the mayor did whatever Casale bade him do . All the witnesses were asked if in their opinion Casale was a galantuomo , mid one portrayed his " moral physiognomy . " This evidence against Casale , sounding so dull and stale in New York ears , produced great excitement . The judges retired , and in a short time brought in their judgment that the facts alleged by the newspaper were proved . Casale immediately resigned his seat in the Chamber of Deputies and the other official positions that lie held . The great effect of this judgment shows that , though the Neapolitan system of political favoritism and corruption has been well constructed by the ability of one man , who has made skillful use of the spirit of the Camorra , that system is inferior in efficiency , boldness , and money-making capacity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. The Camorra belongs to the mainland , the Mafia to Sicily . It is hard for is foreigner to understand the differences between these famous bodies : the Camorra is a society founded on blackmail ; the Mafia is a series of societies , the outgrowth of ignorance and impotent government . As the lawsuit between Casale and La Propaganda has brought the Camorra freshly before the public , so the legal investigations to unearth evidence against Notarbartolo 's murderer have made Italy aware that she has another great social problem in the Mafia . Some ten years ago the government banks " got into politics , " as we say ; and among others the Bank of Sicily was made use of for private ends . It was enough to be a friend of a friend of a politician , for a man to get a loan on insufficient security or at a very low rate of interest ; and a great many scamps profited thereby . Public moneys were wasted , and the penal code set at naught . At // last public sentiment was aroused , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capable , energetic man , who , for unexplained reasons , had been removed from the direction of the bank just before this criminal misuse of its funds , was , by character and knowledge , the very man to ferret out the guilty and bring them to punishment . The public turned impetuously to hiss as the instrument of justice . In January , 1893 , investigation was ready to begin . On the afternoon of February 1 Notarbartolo was traveling to Palermo in the first-class carriage of an express train . About six o'clock the train passed the little town route Curreri . A few minutes later , ass officer of customs , going home at the end of his day 's work , crossed the tracks : there he saw a body lying outstretched on the ground . He ran back , calling for help . The body was Notarbartolo 's . Not far away , in a peasant 's house , the police discovered a bloody handkerchief and a pair of shoes splashed with blood . Some witnesses now say , a man 's boots rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and others , a woman 's shoes . Handkerchief and shoes soon disappeared ; nobody knew what because of them . One official said this , another that , a third something different . Two of the trainmen were arrested soon after the murder , but they were released by the officials in Palermo , for want of evidence . One Fontana was arrested ; he proved that he was in Tunis at the time of the crime , and was also released by the officials in Palermo . It is said that a Sicilian 's first step toward crime is to prepare an alibi . Fontana was well known to the police . He had been tried on massy charges , ? stealing cattle with incidental murder , threatening death in anonymous letters , assassination , a second assassination , stealing cattle and attempting to kidnap , extortion , complicity with felons , ? but each time be bad escaped , from lack of testimony . These three men have been rearrested , and the government has thought it well to hold the criminal proceedings in Milan . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments in the hands of some powerful man . One Palizzolo , an old politician , deputy from Palermo , rumor said , had had many dealings with the bank , by which lie had been no loser . His reputation was not good ; it was charged that as far back as 1873 he was indebted to the municipality of Palermo in the sum of 1500 francs , for taxes which he , as commissioner , had collected and converted to his own use , and in the sum of 1550 trusses , the price of a pump sold by the city to a neighboring town . ' lids man was well known to be a bitter opponent of Notarbartolo , and suspicion pointed to hint ; but for all these years , on account of the immense power of the Maliss , it ' sus been impossible to collect enough evidence to put him on trial . Thssnks to the testimony secured in Milan , he is now under arrest and awaiting trial . Palizzolo may be regarded as bearing a relation to the Mafia similar to that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are different opinions : one man has defined it as a union of individuals of all classes , who like to live , not by work , but by violence , fraud , and intimidation ; another , as the union of men of every rank , profession , and kind , without any permanent bond apparent , always united to further each other 's interest in disregard of law . It is , as I have said , a collection of societies existing throughout Sicily , but more common in some parts than in others , without any definite connectibn between them , except that the chibfs in the same neighborhood know%ne another , and are always ready to conperate to their common advantage . A typical society is controlled by three or four leaders , men of force and resolution , who carry out their plans by the agency of some dozen young mess , ? part vigorous young ruffians , part lads lack- deleted material // tue of necessity , disband her soldiery , and create a precedent for disarmament that other nations may follow . In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have set in its strength , and help abolish the spirit of Mafia and Camorra from international dealings .
