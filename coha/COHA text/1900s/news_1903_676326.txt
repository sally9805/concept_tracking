txt The best data obtainable as to the status of the typhoid epidemic here are admittedly incomplEte . They show that up to the end of last week Ithere had been 755 cases of typhoid in Ithaca since Jan. 10 of which the clinical history is obtainable . The number of unreported eases is a matter of estimate . In view of the fact that most physicians have neglected , and that some have refused , to make returns , and that in death certificates some of them persistently refrained from assigning causes likely to be recognized as typhoid complications , I venture the opinion that the number of cases , light and grave , occurring up to this time since the present epidemic began , would be conservatively estimated at 1,000 . It is impossible to learn the number of deaths due to typhoid fever or to calculate the percentage . The returns to the Board of Health have not been tabulated . I have tried to get the figures ever since coming to Ithaca . and have been unable to do so . r4 The impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant in fact than I should be glad to discover . I do not know how many cases there are at present in Ithaca , but I am constrained to express the belief that there are not less than 2 : ' , 0 cases of which no official record has been made . IC told , as I have been on very good authority , . that the number was double this estimate , I should not find myself in a position to dispute it . A great many or these eases are of a kind popularly known as " walking typhoid . " People are going about their business , pursuing their studies , and even following the mechanical trades with temperatures of 10:1 to 104 . Sometimes they give up and another " case " is reported ; more often they fight through and escape anything worse than a mild attack , which may or may not come to the knowledge of a physician in shape to warrant a confident diagnosis . What potentialities of mischief in disseminating the infection reside in these neglected ambulant cases may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has interest . MNDIBMIC WPM : HD IN ITHACA , Those who believe or have been persuaded that the epidemic now running its course is " a bolt from the blue sky " are not well Informed . The first information I gained from local inquiry was that Ithaca has for many years been remarkably free from typhoid fever . Front a closer and more critical int estigation I am convinced that this is far from the truth . Typhoid has been more or less prevalent here for many years . and at no time has Ithaca long been free from it . For at least ten years the cautionary signals have been obvious to any one who might have chosen to look for them . A mistaken loyalty to the public interest has imposed the obligation of silence upon those who should have spoken through a megaphone into the dull ear of municipal authority . Just a year ago conditions existed Ithaca which should have startled the community into instant and energetic measures of self-protection . 1 refer to the local epidemic of a disease closely resembling a mild type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it , was quite prevalent , and more than 100 cases were treated . No deaths are known to have occurred which were directly attributed to it . The diagnosis was somewhat uncertain and its course erratic . The clinical history of a typical case showed disturbances of the digestive organs , some intestinal inflammation , a heavily coated tongue with . a red tip , a practically continuous fever giving temperatures in severe cases as high as 104 to 105 degrees , but with no regularity and following no rule which could be made the basis of confident prognosis . It was not diagnosed as typhoid at the time . but received the local name of " Ithaca. fever . " It was probably . due to Intestinal infection by some member of the Colon group of bacilli , It was treated symptomatically . In no case was the stage of intestinal hemorrhage known to have been reached , and as far as can be learned the serum test was not applied . The patients mostly got well , and for nearly a year the matter was practically forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions are attributable was undoubtedly the failure on the part of the university and city authorities to recognize in this occurrence of " Ithaca fever " a danger signal demanding the attention given to a red light in the path of an express train . Had it been studied , as it might and should have been in the circumstances , and that done which the knowl , edge thus gained would have suggested , the present outbreak of typhoid might not have been averted , but it would not have found the town and university unprepared , and would have been much less serious . TYPHOID OUTRAZAK OF 1060 , When , shortly after the beginning of this year , cases of " continuing fever " were reported , the physicians looked ' , else and -- remarked to one another that it was a recurrence of the " Ithaca fever . " It rapidly assumed epidemic form , and then they manifested great reluctance to admit any connection between it and the fever of a year before . Perhaps it was more discreet to regard the typhoid outbreak of this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their experience . By Jan. 15 it had gained alarming headway , and the admissions to the City Hospital and University Infirmary were at the rate of ten to twenty a day . Most of the local physicians were at first unable or unwilling to recognize it as typhoiel , until in due course ' intestinal hemorrhages occurred and the Widal test left no room for intelligent discussion as to what they were dealing with . It is interesting to note , however , that at least one physician of some local prominence continues to designate the cases under his care as paracolon fever , and to insist that they do not give the typical reaction to the Widal test , notwithstanding the fact that Dr. V. A. Moore . bacteriologist of the State Veterinary College and a member of the university Faculty , reports this reaction in every test made by him . This , perhaps , explains why in the daily reports of the condition of the sick in hospitals are found the three designations of paracolon fever , typhoid fever , and fever . To what this outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion . In the eagerness to put the blame on some one a cause has been assumea , of which . it must be confessed , no evidence is forthcoming . A study of the area of infection connected it with the city water supply . This is owned and operated by a private company , which from one cause or another has long been extremely unpopular with the citizens . To blame the company was easier and more agreeable than to recognize the fact that perhaps the town was itself largely to blame . But the more closely this matter is studied the larger the elements of doubt introduced into the discussion . The town has four distinct water-distribution areas and one in which there is no distribution . One of these is the campus , supplied from Fall Creek . No typhoid has occurred there . To two areas supplied by the company water is furnished from Six Mile Creek and Buttermilk Creek , respectively . It is not probable that the infection was planted impartially in both streams . The one polluted is popularly supposed to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated occurrences of typhoid in these two areas shows that one is practically no safer than the other . Still another area has a mixed supply , both creeks contributing . The difference between this and the one supplied wholly from Six Mile Creek , as regards infection , is not distinct enough to warrant any confident generalizations . The remaining area . depending upon wells , has had little or no typhoid . Comparing many analyses of water from Fall Creek , the campus supply , with that from Six Mile Creek , I find the normal average of the latter at least as good as that of the former . In other words , the town supply is chemically and in respect to freedom from pollution , as good water normally as the campus supply . As these comparative analyses were made in the Cornell laboratories they are not likely to be intentionally unfair to the campus supply . The story was started , is believed , and has been accepted by the State Board of Health , that during work under direction of the water company in connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Six Mile Creek , a colony of foreign laborers was established on the banks of Six Mile Creek , and that one of these men was stricken with typhoid and polluted the stream . After the most careful investigation I have been able to make , I fail to find a scintilla of evidence in support of this theory . There has been no recognized case of typhoid fever treated by any physician anywhere in or along the watershed of the Ithaca Water Company . No member of the construction gang , which was dispersed on Thanksgiving Day , nearly six weeks before the first case appeared in Ithaca , is known to have lost a day by illness of any kind . Not one fact has been produced which contains the ? assumption that this colony brought typhoid fever into the Six Mile Valley or left it there . That there were no cases of typhoid on the watershed or along tributary streams , I am not prepared either to say or to believe . That the water company was negligent in the matter of the policing of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not open to discussion ? that it was exceptionally so does not appear . The conditions it has tolerated or remained ignorant of are probably identical with those to be found along the sources of a great many public water supplies in this country . As a rule , water companies and Municipal Water Commissioners are no more vigilant than public opinion demands that they shall be . Analyses of the Ithaca water for a series of years show that it is essentially the same as - that of other surface streams . At times it was of satisfactory purity , at other times , especially after a scouring of the watershed by heavy precipitation , it has been very impure . Normally it was as good as is to be expected from any sparsely populated area under farm cultivation and with occasional settlements . It may have been infected , and probably was . Exactly the same is liable at any time to happen to any one of many public water supplies , and does happen every year . It is as likely to happen under municipal as under private control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Company is illogical , and in view of the readiness of the management of the water company to do all that can be done in co-operation with the town and university authorities , it is calculated to delay , and perhaps defeat , a solution of the question of a pure and satisfactory watee supply . As an instance of nascent popular zeal not directed by wise advice , I may mention the beginning made on Thursday last to develop a supply of water for the town from driven wells . Near the lower edge of the flats , between the sewage pumping station and the salt works , some enthusiasts have begun the driving of a tube well in a sodden bog at a point where the maximum concentration of seepage from the sewers and cesspools might be expected . They will undoubtedly find water ? no doubt plenty of it  --  but what it will be from day to ( Jai1 would not like to predict . The idea is that if the expectations of the promoters of this undertaking are realized in the finding of an unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's conscience , it will be pumped into the distributing mains of the Ithaca Water Company , designed for a gravity system . It does not seem to have occurred to any one that if this were done it would blow out all the plumbing and rupture every lead pipe in Ithaca . The driven-well experiment is interesting simply as showing the eagerness of the public in the present condition of excitement to do foolish things . THE WATER SUPPLY . To purify and protect the water supply of Ithaca is undoubtedly the first step in - the direction of a restoration of public confidence . That it is the only thing or the most Important thing to be done , and that when it is accomplished Ithaca will be a sanitary paradise . or even a measurably safe place of residence , is as far from the truth as the east is from the west . The first step should and will be a thorough sanitary survey of the whole watershed and the removal or correction of nuisances there found . An adequate filtration plant will then be needed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hesitation in saying , however , that in my judgment the water supply now distributed is the least and most safely negligible , of the many dangers which menace life and health in Ithaca . Excited people who speak of it as " sewage , " who would not even bathe in it , and who question its fitness for the flushing of closets , manifest the degree of intelligence usual in times of popular panic . The water is not good , and not suitable for general use ; but the same is true of surface water supplies almost everywhere . If other causes of danger were corrected there need be no reckless precipitancy in dealing with the problem of the local water supply . However bad it may be , now or normally , it is the least of the dangers to which the people of Ithaca are subjected . During the coming Summer that will be done which will insure the distribution of a water supply of attested and indisputable purity and potability . But those who believe that this will solve the problem of the sanitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded for the construction and installation within the next thirty days of a mechanical filter plant for the campus supply . While it is true that there have been no cases of typhoid this year among the campus population , the Fall Creek water has not been used from the taps for drinking purposes . and artesian well water has been freely supplied . Those who have not taken this have boiled their domestic supplies , and in most instances the alarmed hill population have refused even to bathe in water which has not been drawn as hot as possible from the kitchen boilers and cooled by standing . These precautions detract somewhat from the . - alue of comparison between the campus supply and the town supply . The filtration of the Fall Creek water is a wise precaution . It needs it quite as much as does that from Six Mile Creek . The conditions existing along the banks of Fall Creek are quite as bad as , and perhaps worse than , those to be found along Six Miie and Buttermilk Creeks .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
