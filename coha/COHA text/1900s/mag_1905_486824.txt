Among the indirect results of the late elections , the conversion of Gov . Pennypacker of Pennsylvania to the cause of reform surely ranks first . A judge of repute before the machine drafted him for the Governorship , an exemplar of homely honesty in his personal relations , a scholar and antiquarian of parts , Pennypacker had perversely devoted himself and his talents to the defence of everything that was bad in the politics of his State . He simply refused to believe the facts which every Philadelphian knew about gang-rule in his city , regarded the demand for personal registration as of no importance , and signed the outrageous " ripper " bill of last winter on the specious ground that , if the voters did not like it , they could elect legislators who would repeal it before it took effect . It is an event for jubilation as well as surprise that he has now called the Legislature in special session , recommending in his message practically the entire series of reforms for which the minority had so long been vainly struggling . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be built up , he recommends , with  --  in less definite language  --  restoring to the mayors of cities the power of appointment taken away by last year 's Legislature . Legislation designed to break the unholy alliance between the State Treasury and the pet banks of the State is also on his programme . A comparison of the Governor 's case with that of Mayor Weaver is naturally in order . Both were put in office as complaisant machine men ; both  --  though it took the Governor a long time to do so  --  came to a realizing sense of what the old regime meant , and now Pennypacker has the chance to make himself remembered with ' Weaver as emancipator of his commonwealth . Goy . Herrick of Ohio has been discoursing on the text of the November elections . He is naturally something of a weeping prophet . He admits that the people were in search of honest men and pure government , but laments that they made such an awful mistake in Ohio as to reject him . Jerome 's victory Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uprising against corruption in Philadelphia and the whole of Pennsylvania he can appreciate and admire ; but in his own case he is painfully aware that a good man was sacrificed to prejudice . Passing by this Somewhat ludicrous exhibi tion of his own wounds , one observation of Gov . Herrick 's deserves attention . 11 is , that a sort of blind and vindictive desire to punish somebody was evident in the breaking up of the fountains of the political great deep ; and that mere punishment is not a wholesome or fruitful principle in public life . It would be easy to demur to this . Surely , it well that corrupt and complacent bosses should have a foretaste of the day of judgment now and then . Grant that the fury which comes to them with the abhorred shears is blind ; still she gives them the needed reminder that they are but mortal men , that their power is hollow , and that their riches have wings . Consider the case of Boss Murphy . Two months ago he had the most engaging programme marked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boss triumphant was then to strike for the leadership of the Democracy of this State , next to move on conquering into national politics , naming a Goernor and President , and graciously receiving adulation and more of " the stuff . " But now all that has vanished like a scene in the theatre , and Murphy is fighting for his life . Such retribution before the grave is righteous and beneficial , we maintain , even if there were an element of vindictiveness in its infliction by the people . The present plight of Murphy , of Durham , of Lentz , of Cox , of Dick and Penrose and Lodge , is full of moral instruction , whether the rage of the voters vented upon them is but a brief madness or not . In addition to justice , political expediency demands that every step be taken to ascertain the true result of the election on Tuesday week . Hearst as Mayor would be far less formidable than Hearst as a fomenter of discontent and disorder who could allege that he had been cheated out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discredit himself and his cause , and to alienate his support . Out of office and with a grievance , he could inflame the social passions to which he appeals , and make them take on a more furious violence . Hence his stoutest opponents , those who dread him most , should welcome the fullest inquiry into the results of the voting . Every legal remedy should be put freely at the disposal of Hearst and his lawyers . Even their wildest allegations should be sifted . Let them bring forward every claim and charge that they can think of , and have each put to the test of law and evidence , so that , if Mayor McClellan shall finally be found legally elected , the cries of fraud shall have been shown to be baseless . To meet Hearst 's demands for an investigation by the pettifogging methods of a nisi prius lawyer would be the worst of blunders . Let every ballot be inspected and the true count made clear as noonday . Mayor McClellan 's statement of his own attitude is far too hesitant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association to prevent corrupt practices will also devote its attention to a reform of the ballot shows that one of the important lessons of the election is being widely recognized . The agitation must be kept up day by day , even after the Mayoralty contest is settled . Should McClellan be found to be elected by ballots wrongly discarded , it will be unanswerable proof of the failure of the law to prevent the stealing of an election . This would complete the indictment . It is known now that the ballot does not always insure secrecy ; that it incites to minor frauds , and is planned to trick the voters in the interests of the bosses ; that it puts such heavy burdens on the courts as to make their break-down possible . What good can be said of the ballot save that it is an advance on the primitive methods of earlier days ? Certainly , it can not be claimed that the ballot is just to candidates Whose names are far down on the party column . To cite only one case : in 1897 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received in this city alone 90,000 fewer votes than were cast for the Mayoralty candidates . There was , of course , an especial reason for that , but in every election the vote similarly tapers off , because thousands fail to understand the system of voting . The candidate for Lieutenant-Governor in Massachusetts , Henry M. Whitney , who ran against Lodge 's personal candidate , with opposition to the Senator-boss as one of his chief issues , did not run so far ahead of his party ticket as Douglas did last year . Yet relatively he made nearly as serious an inroad on the Republican ranks as did Gov . Russell in 1892 when the State was carried for Harrison . The Bay State 's habit of promoting lieutenant-governors to the chief executive office  --  a meritorious policy if of the people and not of the machine  --  has been followed in Mr. Guild 's case , after a year of virtual probation . It was to the second place on the ticket that everybody looked for an expression of opinion regarding Lodge . Guild , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reciprocity plank , wins by 23,116 , while Draper , the avowed representative of the inseparable stand-pat and Lodge interests , crawls through by less than 2,500 votes . There will be regret , amid rejoicings elsewhere , at the defeat of the reform ticket in San Francisco . Under the domination of Abraham Ruef , the Murphy of Mayor Schmitz , the city has been run in the interests of grafters and law-breakers . Masquerading as a labor-union administration , the Schmitz government has been one which honest workmen must despise , for it means their identification with " red lights " and other tokens of unmitigated evil . John S. Partridge , the reform leader , made a notable fight , proving himself a ! carless , outspoken young leader , and giving the Ruef " gang " a bad scare . As it was , Partridge did well to hold the machine down to only 15,000 plurality . Four years hence the uprising against bosses should infect San Francisco . Meanwhile , the city is to be pitied . Not only its moral welfare , but its proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continuance of the labor demagoguery which rules the municipality . Two important steps towards the reform of our consular and diplomatic service were announced on Saturday . Hereafter , no one can obtain any consular post without first passing the examination which has hitherto applied only to positions the salaries of which are under $2,500 a year . Fitness will henceforth be the test for important offices as well as for unimportant . Of course , much will depend upon the examinations and the stiffness of the marking , but the mere threat of a written test should suffice to keep out of consulships some of the rural Dogberrys who have disgraced the nation hitherto , and given all America so unenviable a reputation abroad . The State Department has also decided that no one can become secretary of legation who is not master of one language besides his native tongue . These are in themselves encouraging rulings , but the promise of further improvements they hold out is even more gratifying . Both the President and Mr. Root are awake to the need of reform , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such permanence as to attract men to it for a life career . The President recommended this to Congress in his last message for the consular service . We saw noted the other day the shipment of a quantity of Bibles and of playing cards for the employees on the Isthmus of Panama . On Thursday the Isthmian Canal Commission authorized Chief Engineer Stevens to build a $7,500 clubhouse for his men at Cristobal . Half-a-dozen more clubhouses are in contemplation . Thus proceed the plans for making life endurable in the canal zone . The hand of the " welfare experts " called in at last is everywhere to be discerned . The Commission has learned thoroughly the lesson that before " making the dirt fly " it must get ready , not merely for the physical performance of digging , but for making its force reasonably contented . It is not yet on the way to an adequate supply of labor , however , and we shall naturally look for a steady increase of inducements until the point of equilibrium is reached . The desired young men would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering them club-life , billiards , and athletic sports . If they still remain at home , there are yet cards to be played . Was not there talk recently at Panama of endowing a theatre ? There should be no surer way of retaining the homesick American than by giving him at his faraway post comforts and luxuries which he could not command at home . A returned canal workman pining in his native town for the delights of Culebra would be an advertisement of inestimable value . The Navy Department is apparently planning to make impossible another killing at Annapolis as the result of prizefighting . It is bad enough that what is forbidden by law in prtwtically every State should go on openly on the decks of Federal warships , with officers sitting by and urging on the fighters . But that this senseless brutality should be permitted and encouraged at Annapolis is really scandalous . Only a couple of years ago the people of thi.s country insisted on the stamping out of hazing at both Annapolis and West 1 ' oint . It was duly suppressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown by the interviews in the Herald and other papers , naval officers believe in them as a means of makings boys manly  --  a belief widely held in the eighteenth century , but now generally discarded , certainly in all civilian institutions of learning . A prizefight at Harvard or Yale or Princeton would be incredible ; and no preparatory school could flourish which permitted such practices . Formerly flogging and the issuance of liquor and other practices were also considered necessary to make good men-of-war 's men . These could not be restored now , but they are not more anachronistic . Secretary Bonaparte has ordered a court-martial . for the survivor of the late contest . The vote of the official representatives of fourteen Southern States in convention at Chattanooga on Friday in favor of a national quarantine comes less than a fortnight after the first day without a yellow fever case in New Orleans . The fact is that agitation for a national quarantine has invariably followed closely on outbreaks of imported disease and died away between times . If Congress met in the season of epidemics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national quarantine system many years ago . In truth , the way in which public confidence in the efficiency of the Federal Government 's work has overbalanced such State-rights sentiments as still survived in Gov . Vardaman 's address to the Chattanooga convention . has been very impressive . Of course , the time passed generations ago when the defence of our seaboard against disease could be regarded as in any sense a local matter . We have had a steadily increasing degree of cooperation between the various State boards of health , and a larger number of the stations at the various ports have been voluntarily turned over to the control of the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service . Thus the complete supplanting of the local jurisdiction now means much less practical change than it would have done a few year ago . A " Theodore Roosevelt Professorship of American History and Institutions " in the University of Berlin would have seemed a marvel to Bancroft or Motley . Its founding by Mr. James Speyer , at a time when the tide of American students flowing to Germany is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lecture at Columbia and Harvard , witnesses a great change of conditions and a still greater change of sentiment . The step itself is not so important as what it signifies . In this matter , the universities , and even the Kaiser and the President , speak less for themselves than for their nations . Unless there were already a good understanding and a fruitful intercourse between the United States and Germany , this interchange of professors would be an empty and slightly comic formality . As it is , we may regard it as an outward sign of a quiet but steady rapprochement of two peoples . A fall in New York bank reserves to less than 25 per cent . of outstanding deposit liabilities is so unusual that last Saturday 's bank statement , showing a shortage of $2,428,000 , excites attention . Under the national-bank act , a reserve of 25 per cent . in specie and legal tender money is stringently required ; the law prescribing that when reserves of a city national bank 's reserve are below that ratio , and until the ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liabilities by making any new loans or discounts otherwise than by discounting or purchasing bills of exchange payable at sight . " The purpose of that exception is , obviously , to leave with the bank the facilities for drawing on outside markets . It is clear that the law deems maintenance of such a ratio of reserves imperative . It goes so far , indeed , as to endow the Federal officers with the power to force the hank out of business if it fails for thirty days to make good the deficiency . Conservative critics are unanimous in approving this requirement ; it is , in fact , deemed much more essential to-day , when the banks are carrying as deposits nearly nine-tenths of the $187,000,000 reserves of the trust companies of this State , than it was before the rise of those institutions . The Bank of England , which similarly holds on deposit the reserves of the English joint-stock banks , regards a 40 per cent . cash reserve as the minimum of prudence . Only on four occasions in the past fifteen years has such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1890 , the cause lay in sudden and heavy demands of Europe on our capital , in both instances because of a London money panic . On a third occasion , in July , 1893 , it was panic at home and a run on bank reserves , that caused the deficiency . Neither circumstance existed in the fourth case referred to , that of September , 1902 , and neither exists to-day . It is true , the European money markets have for various reasons shown their resources to be considerably strained this season , and the active trade at our own interior markets has caused the latter to draw very heavily on their New York credit balances . But the root of the trouble this year , as in the autumn of 1902 , was that a stock speculation of enormous proportions was started by our millionaire " operators " in the very face of the coming money Stringency . In both years , these speculative " pools " and " cliques " were warned by all bankers of judgment and experience , both publicly and privately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no heed whatever to the warning , either in 1902 , or in the present season . In 1902 , the penalty inflicted , when bank reserves had fallen below the legal requirement , was withdrawal of loans which these adventurers had been using to " carry " their inflated stocks , and the consequent rout of the speculators . The resultant reduction of bank liabilities promptly restored equilibrium in the bank return . It remains to be seen how the banks will deal with the similar problem now confronting them . The missionary aspect of the life-insurance business as delineated by President McCurdy of the Mutual continues to crop up in the legislative inquiry  --  most strikingly in the matter of industrial insurance , which must be probed more deeply by the committee . People who buy this form of insurance pay very high rates for it , partly , at least , because of the cost of collecting the small premiums . Solicitors go from house to house , gathering ten-cent pieces and quarter-dollars from house-maids and mechanics . From the point of view of the policyholder , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of saving  --  if we may employ a contradiction in terms . When the 51 per cent . of lapses  --  certified to by Metropolitan officers  --  is reckoned in , the extravagance is yet more startling . No one can deny that though the Metropolitan itself is prosperous , its system , which lays such a burden on the poor , is now open to the gravest suspicion . Mr. Chamberlain 's speech at Birmingham , on November 3 , was called by his admirers a " fighting " speech , but the enemies he was attacking were those of his own household . He turned savagely upon Lord Londonderry , a member of Mr. Balfour 's Cabinet , and proceeded to read him , with Lord Hugh Cecil and all the Unionist free traders , out of the party . Then of the Prime Minister himself , and his conduct of the party and public business , Mr. Chamberlain said as damaging things as have been uttered by any Liberal . He spoke contemptuously of " timorous counsels " and " halfhearted convictions , " and declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ourselves , to a great party , than I can recollect in the course of my political experience . " Of the action of the Government in running away from motions against protection , he spoke as " a stain " upon the Conservative party  --  though , of course , it was a stain put there by Mr. Balfour 's own direction . The Prime Minister might well exclaim : " Call you this backing of your friends ? A plague upon such backing ! " But even worse was to come , for Mr. Chamberlain declared for an early dissolution of Parliament , and affirmed that the longer Mr. Balfour delayed his appeal to the country , the worse he would be beaten . Throughout the speech , in fact , ran a tone of angry impatience and bitter defiance , the implication being that the speaker was in a great hurry to have his party defeated under his friend Balfour , and then turn to Chamberlain himself for a programme and a leader . French Cabinets are so chronically in unstable equilibrium that the wonder always is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . M. Rouvier had a narrow escape on Friday , and the extreme bitterness displayed in the Chamber might seem to make his retention of power improbable . Still , the wolves had the Minister of War , who has been very unpopular , thrown to them , and that may keep them quiet for a time . Moreover , Rouvier 's appeal to the bloc to remain solid , lest the bill for the separation of Church and State fail , may have its effect . It is very like an embarrassed Republican appealing to dissenters to rally and save the sacred tariff . Rouvier , it is well known , has personally had no zeal in the movement to disestablish the Church . He simply inherited the separation bill from his fiercely doctrinaire predecessor , M. Combes , and has accepted it as one of the conditions of keeping his Government a going concern . The measure has passed the Chamber and is now under debate in the Senate . Grave doubts exist about its passing before the general elections of next year ; but it may be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups to which he has to look for support . The very fact , too , that there is soon to be a new Chamber and a new President of the Republic , should tend to still the clamor for a new Ministry , which would inevitably be short-lived . Yet there are evidently powerful influences at- work against the present Prime Minister . Jaures is leading off the Socialists , and Delcass ? ' s many friends are watching for an opportunity to take revenge for his dismissal . And the dissatisfaction over Rouvier 's surrender to Germany in the matter of the Morocco Conference , wise though it was , does not appear to abate with time . Reports of the triumph of liberalism in Russia alternate with accounts of fiendish brutality . Autocracy and medimvalisin die hard . The mutiny at Cronstadt confronted Witte when he was called upon to suppress riots and revolts in towns hundreds of miles apart . The announcement of his cabinet fails to evoke enthusiasm , either in the ranks of Liberals or in those of reactionaries . None of the members ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was associated with M. Witte , at Portsmouth , is most widely known outside Russia  --  has been prominently identified with the Zemstvoists or Moderate Liberals , who are the steadying influence at the present day . But Count Witte , like others of the few great men who have reorganized a state out of chaos . may be his own ministry . It is not to be expected that the radical element will be easily appeased , while the formation of an Upper Chamber , one-half of whose members are to be appointed by the Czar , will not allay the skepticism of even those moderate Liberals who have hailed with delight the final dismissal of Gen. Trepoff . The most hopeful sign of the dawn of a new era in Russia is the report that Prince Obolensky , the successor of Pobyedonostzeff , has appealed to the priests to stop the slaughter of the Jews . Of all the measures proposed , whether in this country or abroad , to put an end to the unspeakable atrocities that have wrung the heart of mankind , none will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orthodox Church .
