txt School Children Circulating Petitions In Its Favor . A great deal has been said and written about the trickery the men have used th their opposition to the White bill , but very little about that of the women . I have up till now taken very little interest in this struggle between the male and female teachers . An incident , however , happened to-day which led me to write this . A boy entered my house and asked me to sign a petition . It was written in pencil , purporting to come from the " mothers and fathers of the pupils " of a school in my section asking the Mayor not to veto the White bill . My indignation was aroused by the fact that the very pupils of the schools should have been drawn into this most undignified fight , which has been conducted according to the lowest political principles . Even should the Mayor sign the White bill and the women win their fight , they would have little to feel proud over in their victory .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
