txt Bishop Isaac Joyce , who is presiding over the northwest Indiana conference , now in session hero , wants to found a chair of common sense in theological schools . In reference to his wishes the bishop said : " It is a fact tnat GICKI ' calls poor boys to the ministry and they are forced to go through many sacrifices before they are fully equipped for the work of the ministry . The pioneers of Methodism had no theological training , or at least the training of theological schools . Therefore their preaching was genuine and right from the heart : " I do not wish to be put down as against the theological school , but I wish those schools would introduce a new chair and call it the chair of common sense . It is needed in the training of young men for the ministry . Some of them actually lose their best traits by too much book learning . The preacher should be skillful in himself and the school should help his skill . " The path for preachers Is laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Holiness should be preached , not the sour , cranky Pind that only makes men feel bad and bitten ? , but that which is cheerful and gracious . I would like to see young men who were strong within themselves . who had the right kind of judgment , who would study human nature as well as the scriptures , and know the people with whom they had to come in contact in the capacity of pastor .
