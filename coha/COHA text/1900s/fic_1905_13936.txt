The two scenes , which precede the dialogue of the play , are not drawn in detail but are merely a few lines and lights to show the steep snow-tipped Sierras , the trail , the silent California night , deep ravines , and cabins of the miners of ' 49 hid amongst the manzanitas and pines ; in fact , the scene represents a little world by itself , drawn in a few crude strokes , to explain more than the author could tell in a thousand pages . The curtain rises to a glimpse of Cloudy Mountain , in the Sierras . The peak is white , the sky above very blue , and the moon , which seems strangely near , shines on the steep trail leading up to the cabin of the Girl . A lamp , placed in the cabin window by WOWKLE , the squaw , shows that the Girl has not yet come home from her place of business , the Polka Saloon . This scene shifts to an exterior view of the Polka Saloon and the miners cabins at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps , the rattle of poker chips , and an occasional " whoop " , show that life in the Polka is in full swing . The strains of " Dooda Day " are heard from within , the singer accompanying himself on the concertina : " Camp town ladies , sing this song , Dooda ! Dooda ! Camptown race track , five miles long , Dooda ! Dooda ! Day.G'wine to run all night , G'wine to run all day , Bet my money on a bob-tail nag , Somebody bet on the bay . " As the scene shifts to the interior of the Polka , we see a large square barroom , built of rough pine boards . A pair of scales for weighing gold-dust , and a dice-box used to " shake for drinks " , are on the bar . Behind the bar on a shelf are liquors , cigars , and chewing tobacco . The till contains one and two bit pieces , Mexican dollars , and slugs of gold ( $50 ) . The safe is made out of an empty whiskey keg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and strings of red peppers hang from the rude rafters . A stuffed grizzly bear graces the scene , a small green parasol in one paw , a battered old silk hat on its head . An odd collection of hats and caps are stuck on the prongs of a pair of elk antlers on the wall , and several saddles lie on the floor under the antlers . The furniture is composed of pine chairs , a faro table , a poker table , and an old whittled desk at which the miners write their rare letters to those at home . A $5000 reward for the road-agent , Ramerrez , or information leading to his capture , signed by Wells-Fargo , is tacked to the back of the door . The platform on which a camp minstrel is singing " Dooda Day " is protected by a piece of sheet iron which the musician can lift as a shield to ward off stray bullets in case of a sudden quarrel . The room is heated by a blazing pine log fire in an adobe fireplace . A square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ladder , resting against a balcony over the bar , enables the bartender to ascend in case of trouble and cast a quick glance over both rooms . As the interior of the barroom is disclosed , SONORA SLIM , a tall , lanky miner with an emphatic manner , and TRINIDAD JOE , his partner , are playing at faro . The dealer is " SID " , an Australian known as " SIDNEY DUCK " , fat , greasy , unctuous , and cowardly . He is an expert at fancy shuffling . His even voice is heard from time to time , murmuring below the dialogue , as the game goes on . A case-keeper and lookout complete the group at the faro table . BILLY JACKRABBIT , a full-blooded Indian , lazy , shifty and beady-eyed , wearing moccasins , odds and ends of a white man 's costume , and a quantity of brass jewelry , is watching the game . He frequents the barroom , picking up cigar butts , and occasionally , when the opportunity presents itself , steals a drink . HANDSOME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar with HAPPY HALLIDAY , a long-legged fellow , high-booted and spurred . NICK , the bartender , is busy during the act carrying drink into the dance-hall and returning to those in the barroom . He wears ' Frisco trousers , very high-heeled boots , a flashy necktie , a gay velvet vest . He combs his hair over his forehead in a cowlick .

The interior of the cabin has but one room , square , and made of logs . It is half papered as though the owner had bought wall-paper in camp and the supply had given out . There is but one door , and that leads to the trail . This door , in the centre at back , is double boarded and fastened by a heavy bar . It opens on a rough vestibule , built to keep out the storms and cold . The windows , at which are calico curtains , are provided with heavy wooden shutters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of security to the room as though it could be made into a little fortress . The furniture is rather primitive . A bed , screened off by calico curtains , stands at the right side of the room . Below the bed is a bureau covered by a Navajo blanket on which a few crude toilet articles are set about . A cheap black framed mirror , decorated with strings of Indian beads and white cambric roses , hangs over the bureau . A wash-stand , backed by a " splasher " of white oilcloth , is near the bed . On the opposite side of the room , a pine wardrobe , rudely painted by a miner , contains most of THE GIRL 'S clothing . A sunbonnet and shawl hang on a peg driven into the side of the wardrobe . A gay hatbox from Monterey and a small basket grace the top of the wardrobe . A calico curtain covers a few garments hanging on pegs . In an angle , formed by a fireplace , is a row of shelves , holding tin cups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives , forks and spoons . A rocking-chair , made of a barrel , set on rockers and dyed with blueing , is embellished with calico cushions and an antimacassar . There are four other chairs in the room . A pine table is almost in the centre of the room . It is covered with a red cloth and over this a white table-cloth . Three dishes are on the table ; one contains the charlotte " rusks " , one the " lemming " turnover , and the other holds biscuit and chipped beef . A sugar bowl with brown sugar is placed in the centre of the table . A fire burns in a fireplace which has an iron hood , a big back log and a smaller log in front . A pile of wood lies on the floor close at hand . A kettle hangs over the fire and a coffee-pot is set on a log . A few china ornaments , a bunch of winter berries stuck in a glass jar , and a bottle of whiskey with two glasses , are on the mantel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bookshelf for a few well-worn old books . A wolf skin and moccasins are in front of the bureau , a large bear-skin rug is on the floor opposite the fireplace . A few pictures taken from " Godey 's Lady 's Book " , one or two old prints , and a large sombrero hat hang on the wall . A horseshoe over the door and the head of a small antelope , an old pair of snowshoes over the window and a lady 's night-dress on a peg , complete the decorations in the lower part of the room . Above is a loft reached by a ladder which is swung up out of the way . By standing on a chair and reaching up , the ladder may be pulled down to the floor . Some old trunks and a few little boxes are neatly piled on the floor of the loft . Blankets screen off one end of the attic . A lamp hangs from an arm ( swinging from the loft above ) and shines down on the table . The winter is now beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early part of the act , the cabin windows are heavily frosted . When the curtain rises , the scene is lighted by the lamps and the glow from the fireplace . The moon is shining brightly through the window . At the rise of the curtain , WOWKLE , a squaw , is seated on the floor , singing , her papoose on her back . She is dressed in a long cloth skirt , a short red calico skirt hanging over it . She wears moccasins . Her hair is parted in the middle and drawn into two tight little blue-black braids , crossed in the back , low in the neck . She wears a number of glass bead necklaces and small silver hoops in her ears . She is young , beady-eyed , sweet-faced , and rather plump ,  --  the lax , uncorseted , voluptuous type of squaw . She is perfectly goodnatured , at times quizzical , but utterly unreliable and without any ideas of morality . BILLY JACKRABBIT enters BILLY JACKRABBIT Ugh ! p. 59 WOWKLE Ugh !

Always the gambler , he picks up his hat and coat and goes THE GIRL drops the cards and takes JOHNSON in her arms@@ SCENE .  --  The interior of a typical mining-camp dance-hall of the period . The walls are of rough boards nailed across upright beams . The mines are closed on account of the weather , and the hall is decorated in honor of the opening of the " Academy . " Garlands of pine and wreaths of red berries hang over the doors and windows . Yellow curtains hang at the windows . Eagles ' wings , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . Antlers ( on which the miners hang their hats when the " Academy " is in session ) are fastened to the wall , also birds ' wings and a motto , painted on an old weather-beaten piece of wood , " Live and Learn . " A stuffed game-cock and a candle lamp with a reflector are over a door at right . A horseshoe is fastened over the door to the exterior . A lamp hangs from the centre of the ceiling , and stuck in its cheap iron brackets are flags whose stars indicate the number of States of that period . At the back , towards the right , is a platform on which the teacher 's home-made desk stands . It is decorated with a garland of pine . A bunch of red and white berries , a ruler , chalk , a whiskey bottle , glass and bell are on the desk . A box is used for the teacher 's seat . A black-board is at the back , standing on the floor and resting against the table . An old sheet-iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fire is burning brightly . The stove has an iron railing fastened to the base , on which the miners rest their feet . The stove-pipe goes up through the ceiling . Whittled benches are arranged about the room and two or three chairs . SONORA 'S coat is lying on a chair , and TRINIDAD 'S jacket is on the bench against the wall at back . Doors lead to the bar-room , which we saw in the first act , and a glimpse of the bar is shown . Fastened to the frame of one of these doors is a large hand , rudely painted , the index finger pointing to the words , " To the bar ! " A red curtain cuts off the balcony on this same side of the room . Another door , on the opposite side of the room , leads to a lean-to in which there is a door leading to the exterior . A door at back opens directly upon the trail , and , when this door is ajar , one sees the snow-covered country and the green firs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright winter 's morning . At the rise of the curtain , JACK RANCE is sitting near the fire ,  --  worn , pale and waxen . He has not slept , and his eyes are red and half closed as he sits thinking . He is no longer immaculate in dress ,  --  his necktie is partly undone , his waist-coat is unfastened , his boots unpolished , his hair is ruffled and his cigar ( in his hand ) has gone out . NICK , standing near the foot of the platform , seems troubled as he looks through the window as though towards THE GIRL 'S cabin . NICK I 'd be willin ' to lose the profits of the bar , if we could git back to a week ago , before Johnson walked into this room . He pours out a drink p. 111 JACK RANCE showing feeling.Johnson !

JACK RANCE What did she see in that Sacramento shrimp to love ? NICK puts his foot on a chair , hands the drink to RANCE.Well , you see , I figger it out this boss : love 's like a drink that gits a-holt on you , and you ca n't quit it 's a turn of the head , or a touch of the hands , or it 's a half sort of smile  --  and you 're doped  --  doped with a feelin ' like strong liquor runnin ' through your veins  --  RANCE drops the hand which holds the glassan ' there ai n't nothin ' on earth can break it up , once you 've got the habit .

It 's all the Heaven there is on earth , and , in nine cases out of ten , it 's Hell . There is a pause RANCE , deep in thought , lets his glass tip and his whiskey drip to the floor . NICK touches RANCE 'S arm , points to the whiskey . RANCE takes out his watch , glances at it , hands the glass back to NICK , who goes towards the door leading to the bar p. 112 JACK RANCE Well , Nick , her road-agent 's got off by now .

Say that in your heart again for me  --  now . Perhaps I believe it  --  perhaps I do n't . I hope I do . I want to . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luck of it . Say it . He kneels at her feet , his head bowed . THE GIRL prays silently , crossing herself before she begins , and , at the end of the prayer , they embrace . SONORA opens the door quietlyGod bless you !

You 're free ! There is a pause . The men stand silently looking at each other@@ The boundless prairies of the West . On the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week later . " Oh , my beautiful West ! Oh , my California ! " The scene is a great stretch of prairie . In the far background are foothills with here and there a suggestion of a winding trail leading to the West . The foliage is the pale green of sage brush ,  --  the hills the deeper green of pine and hemlock . In the foreground is a little tepee made of two blankets on crossed sticks . The tepee is built against a grass mound and is apparently only a rude shelter for the night . Back of the tent is an old tree stump which stands out distinctly against the horizon . Here and there are little clumps of grass , bushes and small mounds of earth and rocks . A log fire is burning to the left of the tepee , a Mexican saddle lies beside the fire . As the curtain rises , the stage is in darkness . JOHNSON is lying on the grass , leaning against his saddle , smoking a cigarette . THE GIRL is inside the tepee . Gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible , THE GIRL pushes aside the blanket and appears in the opening . GIRL Dick , are you awake ? DICK JOHNSON turning to her.Another day the dawn is breaking . p. 147 GIRL looking towards the unseen hills in the distance.Another day Look back the foothills are growing fainter  --  every dawn  --  farther away . Some night when I am going to sleep , I 'll turn  --  and they wo n't be there  --  red and shining . That was the promised land . DICK JOHNSON rising.We must look ahead , Girl , not backwards . The promised land is always ahead . A glimmer of the rising sun is seen on the foliage of the foothills GIRL Always ahead Yes , it must be . She comes out of the tepee and goes up the pathDick : all the people there in Cloudy  --  how far off they seem now  --  like shadows in a dream . Only a few days ago , I clasped their hands ; I saw their faces  --  their dear faces ! And now they are fading . In this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost them . There are tears in her voice DICK JOHNSON Through you , all my old life has faded away . I have lost that . GIRL Look ! Pointing to the left as she notices the sunriseThe dawn is breaking in the East  --  far away  --  fair and clear . p. 148 DICK JOHNSON A new day Trust me . Stretching out his hands to herTrust me . A new life ! GIRL A new life .
