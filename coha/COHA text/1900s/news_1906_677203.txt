txt Army and , navy officers and members of the Diplomatte Corps who have been invited to attend the wedding of Miss Alice Roosevelt and Nicholas Longworth on Saturday have been greatly puzzled over the question of dress . If it were to be a state function , of course full military dress , with gold lace , v ould be required for the officers . As the President has made it known , however , that he wishes it to be understood that the wedding will not partake of a public nature , many of those concerned raised the point that ordinary morning dress would be advisable . There has been much discussion of the point among the officers concerned , as it was felt that there should be uniformity in the matter .
