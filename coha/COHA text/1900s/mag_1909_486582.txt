The American people , said Senator Rayner in his speech in the Senate last Monday , " have not yet fully absorbed the significance " of the Nicaraguan imbroglio . But they are in a fair way- to do so . The very proposals of the Maryland Senator will enlighten them . When Representative Sulzer rose in the House to demand that PreSident Taft " arrest " President Zelaya and , try him for murder , most people only laughed . That was merely one of the amusing ways of the " peepul 's " William . But Senator Rayner is a real lawyer , with a reputation to sustain . Yet he commits himself to doctrines and policies fully as wild as Sulzer 's . He would have Congress authorize and virtually direct President Taft to " take all necessary steps for the apprehension " of Zelaya , and to " bring him to trial " for the murder of two American citizens . And this is put forward in the name of the well-settled principles of justice and the established canons of international law ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Senator Rayner 's standing can tie himself up to such amazing doctrines . The most charitable supposition is that much learning about Zelaya 's outrages hath made him mad . Mr. Rayner has made himself known as a man of warm humane sympathies . His arraignment of Zelaya sounds like an expression of sincere indignation . And it may be granted that the Nicaraguan dictator can scarcely be painted in colors too black . From all the evidence available , he seems indeed to have run a career of unspeakable oppression and cruelty But even if we concede his lawlessness and villany to be worse than King Bomba 's , the fact remains that he is a foreigner entirely outside the criminal jurisdiction of the United States , and , moreover , is the de facto chief of state of a neighboring and friendly republic To punish his disregard of law , are we ourselves going to fling legal procedure to the winds ? To show our detestation of his flouting of the rights of our citizens under international law , are we to deny that he and his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to produce later the precedents for the absurd course which he advocates-war on Nicaragua which is yet not to be war . We shall await his precedents with curiosity , but fear that the fundamental conception underlying them will be found Lo be , that the people and government of Nicaragua have no rights which ws are bound to respect . What is most disquieting and even alarming about all this is the evidence it yields that an attempt is to be made to work Americans into a " patriotic " frenzy over Nicaragua . They are told that they have not yet perceived the full " significance " of the affair . So we have an agitation stirred up in Congress and the press . The aim seems to be so to inflame public sentiment that unwise and extreme and illegal measures may be condoned if not demanded Thus far , the country has not been excited about the matter . The general opinion has not yet gone beyond believmg that Zelaya is a great criminal , that conditions in Nicaragua are deplorable , and that our Government ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are upheld . But we see what happens when a thing of this kind is let loose with clamorous publibity . The State Department does well to take a firm stand for what it believes to be the due protection of Americans abroad , but when its vigorous language is at once given to the press , along with its denunciations of a foreign ruler , a flame is kindled which may easily grow into a conflagration . Irresponsible politicians instantly throw on fresh fuel ; and sensational newspapers try to flog the people into hysteria . No prudent statesman will fail to reckon with this new danger of American inflammability . It was comparatively safe in Webster 's day to send and publish a dispatch , as he did in the Koszta case , in which , as he complacently wrote to a friend , he " let the eagle scream " a little ; but there has been an enormous change since then . We have had the war about Cuba , for one thing , brought on by methods of political chicane and newspaper excitement undreamed of by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South and Central America , as we see their concern reflected in dispatches to foreign newspapers . It is none of Senator Rayner 's precedents " that they dread , but the precedent of the Spanish war , when Americans were gradually and artfully whipped into a delirium . A repetition of that mania is what some are to-day trying to torce upon us reduce freights The cumulative effect of the increased charges and expenses on the one side , and of diminished earnings on the other , would be simply disastrous . Ship-'owners generally admit this . Those who support tariff reform as a policy hope to profit by a system of bounties . Nobody would thus incidentally speak of people " hoping to profit by a system of bounties , " if a system of bounties were already in operation in the busiz ness he was talking about , and of which he is one of the leading representatives . Many persons will find this little side-remark more convincing than elaborate citations of statistics . The note of the whole discussion is the crucial importance of the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All that Mr. Booth and his associates in that great interest in Liverpool ask for is a continuance of free access to the best opportunities that the world affords . ' The best ships , bought at the lowest prices  --  that is the explanation , according to Mr. Booth , of the ability of British shipowners to keep a preponderant share of the world 's carrying trade . " We build , " says Mr. Booth , " the cheapest ships in the world . Even Germany , with considerably cheaper labor , can not beat us here . The difference in first cost between a ship built in Great Britain and a ship of similar tonnage , material , and equipment built in the United States is anything from 30 to a per cent . The importance of this advantage can hardly be exaggerated . " The competitor , he points out , who has to bear the burden of an unnecessarily expensive ship , is handicapped not only by the greater amount consequently required to pay interest on the capital , but also by a proportional increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in insurance charges . The failure of American efforts to revive shipbuilding and shipowning for the foreign carrying trade he ascribes to our protectionist policy ; while Germany 's phenomenal advance in the same line , in spite of her general protectionist system , - is explained by the fact that an exemption from the burden of that system has been made in favor both of shipbuilders and shipowners , who have been enjoying all the benefits of free trade . Another tender spot in the protectionist system in this country is incidentally touched by Mr. Booth , when he says that the difference in the cost of ships in the United States is greatly increased by the practice of " the Steel Trust and other suppliers of material for shipbuilding of selling dear at home and cheap abroad . " He does not at all relish the prospect of this charming device being introduced into England , as it might be if the Chamberlainite proposals were adopted . Evidently there is still a good deal of toughness in the English hold on free-trade principles , and it will take some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the Booth stamp . To hold your own against competitors by being able to deliver the goods at a lower price and still make a reasonable profit  --  that is the genuinely British way of looking at the matter . To hold your own against competitors by ruling them out at home and making an exorbitant profit , and underselling them abroad by giving foreigners better terms than your own countrymen  --  that is the modern protectionist idea . Before the people of the United States will add on to this scheme the additional feature of direct bounties out of the national treasury , they will wish to know a thing or two . And among other things , they will probably wish to know whether it would n't be well to try the plan of simply giving our shipowners a chance to get their ships at a fair price , before entering on a subsidy policy which is sure to bring with - it , demoralizing consequences . MORE NEWS FROM THE POLE . Whatever may be the case as regards history in general , no one can deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rapidity and exactness that leave nothing to be desired . One improbability cloth tread upon another 's heel , so fast they follow . Moreover , they keep coining in pairs , so prettily matched that , like the spellings of Tony Weller 's name , a choice between them is left to the taste and fancy of each individual . The first story of Cook 's conquest of the Pole was improbable ; but what could have been pronounced more improbable in advance than that a great university should incontinently confer upon him a doctorate for the achievement unless ample proof had been presented ? The episode of the Eskimo youths , presented just such opposite improbabilities ; and so did the Barrill affair . And now come an able seaman and his business-man friend , and make affidavit that they supplied the doctor - with a complete set of " faked " observations covering his dash to the Pole . The affidavits are so circumstantial that it is difficult to doubt their truthfulness ; but why did Cook fail to pay them their price , when the betrayal Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all this than is natural . Even the very names involved in the Cook affair are so strange as to seem to belong to the world of fiction rather than of fact . Not content with Wake and Wack , he must consort with Dunkle and Loose , regardless of the suggestion of ways that are dark and tricks that are vain which the conjuncture Can hardly fail to provoke . But with the plot thickening as ' it now is , and a conclusion likely in the near future , it is hardly worth while to weigh too solemnly this particular addition to the evidence in the Cook case . On the face of it , the matter looks very bad for the doctor , and it seems almost a duty of charity to point out a way of escape for him if the net tightens . If worse comes to worst , and it should be proved beyond the possibility of doubt , by the identity of the Copenhagen figures with those of Dunkle and Loose , that the records have been-doctored and cooked , there is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's champions There is eminent psychological authority for the view that to be found out in a cheat of this kind should not be regarded by the eye of science as seriously damaging ; that , indeed , it may , under certain ' circumstances , be looked upon as evidence of general honesty . Cook , let us suppose , is a perfectly honest and exceptionally guileless man . He has reached the Pole ; he knows it himself beyond a doubt , and he is pained to find himself in a difficult position owing to the perverse skepticism of an unkindly generation . This difficulty , he feels , can not be removed by the presentation of his genuine observations , which , though good enough for all practical purposes , will be picked to pieces by cold-hearted scientists because he is not enough of a nautical expert to have made them with the requisite accuracy . What more natural than that he should accept the aid of a kind navigator who will give him a better set- of observations ? He does n't viant them for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish what he knows to he the truth . And the very fact that he is not afraid to do all this in the dark , and thus run the risk of the most cruel accusations of fraud , only brings out the simplicity of his nature . The story told by the two worthies has a great deal of interest , quite aside from its evidential bearing on the North Pole question . Here is a bit of conversation between Dr. Cook and Captain Loose : " Do you think you could help me work out those altitudes ? " " Of course I could , " replied the captain . " How could you do it ? " asked Dr. Cook . " why , that 's easy , " said the captain . " I 'll work ' them out backwards . " Dr. Cook asked if he really knew how to work out observations backwards . . , " you can be of some service to me . " This is Silas Wegg and Mr. Boffin over again , with the same wonder on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " work them out backwards " as Mr. Boffin felt at Mr. Wegg 's attainments when he found that " all print was open to him . " And the business man is as notable in his own way as the sailor man in his . When Dunkle named the price at $4,000 , and Dr. Cook " gasped some , " Dunkle showed true American quickness and humor : " I assured him , " he says , " that we thought we had the market cornered , " a remark which must have struck the doctor as eminently correct . An interesting feature , too , is the sublime self-confidence of Loose , real or assumed . " Dr. Cook , " he says , " you know that the observations which you had would n't prove anything to anybody . But if you stick to this set , they will carry you through any university in the world . Do n't you be afraid that they will not pass those scientists at Copenhagen . " Apparently , it did not occur to either of the parties that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that observations could be fabricated without any trouble . Finally , it is interesting to notice the delicacy of the language employed on both sides throughout . Never was there anything more than an implication that the observations of Dr. Cook himself might be non-existent or worthless . Some ofothe high officials in charge of our relations with foreign countries might take pattern by these unprofessional diplomats in the observance of euphemistic forms to cover unpleasant realities . HARVARD AND THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM . The action taken by the Board of Overseers of Harvard University in relation to the elective system furnishes impressive evidence both of the ripeness of the time for the contemplated changes and of-the firm grasp with which President Lowell has taken hold of his new duties . It is in response to a sentiment that has been steadily growing for some years , and which is now predominant in educational circles , that a radical modification of the system is being made at Harvard ; but that action so definite and thoroughgoing should be taken so soon after the inauguration of the new president is a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the significance of the step in itself , it is within bounds to characterize it as among the most Important events that have come about in the college world for many years , and one which will rejoice the hearts of nearly all who have given serious thought to that " problem of the college " of which we hear so much nowadays . It means much to thousands of individual young men whose choice of studies it will directly affect ; it means more as an assertion of the attitude of the foremost of American colleges toward the underlying questions of college education . In saying this , we do not wish to be understood as subscribing to some ? of those extreme forms which attack upon the idea of the Harvard elective system has taken . Thus a professor in the Columbia School of Law , in an article just printed in the Columbia University Quarterly , says : " It was upon the misconception that education meant an accumulation in the student 's mind of a heterogeneous mass of undigested facts and of disassociated ideas that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is so far from being true that it is almost the opposite of the truth . When a reaction takes place against a system which was at first bailed with enthusiastic applause and which has been tried and found wanting , it is curious how ready people . are to call the men of the preceding generation nothing better than fools . The accumulation of a " mass of facts , " heterogeneous or homogeneous , was the very thing that President Eliot and his associates in the movement cared least for ; and it was an undervaluation , not an overvaluation , of such accumulation , that formed part of their motive in throwing overboard the old curriculum . What they wished to accomplish was to put life into the student 's interest in his studies by giving him freedom of ' choice ; what they aimed at was reality and significance in college studies , in direct contrast to the meaningless accumulation which they felt that the old curriculum represented in the ? case of a large proportion of the students . Their error was not in seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in a too close concentration of their thoughts upon a single desideratum , they lost sight of other aspects of the question of education which are even more important , and the neglect of which is now recognized as having disastrous consequences . Their hobby was not a bad thing in itself ; but they rode it too hard , as many have thought all along , and as almost everybody sees now . The system that is to be substituted for the complete freedom of choice that has hitherto prevailed at Harvard is indicated with sufficient definiteness by the resolutions of the Overseers . A committee of the faculty is to be appointed , . with the president as chairman , to " prepare general rules for the choice of electives , to be approved by the faculty , based upon the principle that a student must take a considerable amount of work in some one field and that the ? rest of his courses must be well distributed . " This is the kernel of the whole matter ; all the rest is subsidiary , . including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of " a large ' number of advisers for the students . " It may safely be assumed that the details of the plan will be worked out by the-committee in a practical manner . The purpose is plain enough . The-choice of a college course may be made ? ' sufficiently elastic to give due consideration to a student 's proclivities and to his-prospective occupation , without the sacrifice of the primary idea of a college ? education ; but that idea is completely lost sight of when mere number of-hours in the classroom is regarded , as it has been , as a full measure of value . Even supposing that the choice was-made in good faith in every instance , . there are a score of fundamental objections . The want of coordination is of " itself an almost fatal defect , but there are others fully as serious . Most fallacious of all is the notion that one study contributes as much as another to that general development of the mind which must be the primary aim of any college education - worthy of the name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherent but which experience shows to be of the utmost practical importance , we are confronted with the fact that in thousands of cases studies are chosen with no other measure of their attractiveness than that furnished by their standing in the scale of " soft snaps . " All this the Harvard authorities are preparing to do away with ; and to substitute for it something approaching the coherence and balance of the old college course , which , whatever its faults , was successful in building up , generation after generation , men who justly bore the title of gentleman and scholar . THE GAY SCIENCE OF PHILOLOGY . Philologists pass for dull dogs . Deeply immersed in severe studies , they preach and are supposed to practise a scientific method of inhuman exactitude . Many of them admit this , and the solemn occasions on which they convene are frequently enlivened by discussion whether , for the good of the feebleminded greater number , philology ought not really to loosen up . But it can easily be shown that , far from being the most precise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most romantic of the arts . These grave men are inwardly fond adventurers and their trade as hazardous as the quest of samphire . Only consider the interpretation of that charming Middle English poem , " The Pearl , " which Professor Gollancz first rescued from the files of the Early English Text Society . Five translations and commentaries have ensued Now , the especial point about this very pretty poem is that it either is or is n't that quite slippery thing , an allegory . It appears to be a lament for a little girl who is dead , whose purity is symbolized by the pearl . It is certain , that is , that the pearl means the girl , and it may well be that both , after approved rnedival fashion , mean something else Hard words have passed on this issue , and in more robust days blood would doubtless have been shed . Where the fun really comes in is not in the rightness or wrongness of the partisans , but in the fact that half a dozen scholars of repute , professing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbled the meaning as to prove that the pearl was a real girl . Professor Schofield of . Harvard , who is of the other opinion , has relentlessly shoWn them up in the vivacious periodical published by the Modern Language Association . One of them had inferred from the reality of the bereavement  --  itself an inference  --  an entire domestic tragedy . Somewhere , if he is rightly translated , the poet declares that he has been two years alone . Clearly , his wife has left him , and that being so , she may have gone off with another man , accentuating the husband 's grief for the loss of his daughter . The pearl , or is it the girl ? is once spoken of as " secret , " which gives only too much reason to suppose that the innocent heroine of the poem was illegitimate . So philology has dealt with one piece of literature , and yet they say the philologists are prosaic fellows . Turpin himself never more deftly lightened a heavy purse of its superfluous coin than these translators , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pearl " of all evidence controverting their theories . If the gayety of a science depends upon the temper of its devotees , evidently philology will not fit into the dismal category . But romance requires also the air of varied circumstance . Here , too , the philologer walks in wide-eyed expectancy . From the sands of Turkestan have come recently the fragments of a new Aryan language . The discovery of an inscribed spear-head might any day establish a new theory or mortally smite an old one . Years ago Professor Sievers declared that certain portions of the Anglo-Saxon poem of the Creation abounded in Continental words and phrases , and must be a translation from an Old Saxon original For some time his rivals cheerfully demonstrated that he knew neither Old Saxon nor Anglo-Saxon . It looked as if his theory must remain in the limbo of unproved hypotheses . But one day another German scholar was rummaging in the Vatican library , and that day , in William James 's pregnant words , " truth occurred " to Professor Sievers 's theory ? a sheet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here are suggested hazards of scholastic fortunes with which mere prospecting for gold or cornering cotton can not vie . With philologists one is ever in the realm of the imagination . Prof .. Brans der Matthews takes occasion in his recently published essay on the Speech of the People to praise King Alfred for his " intuitive  --  knowledge " of the profound truth that language " lives in common speech and in daily use , rather than in grammar and in dictionary . " See how the philological fancy glorifies Alfred for what the common man would suppose the great king could n't help doing . But Professor Matthews sees vividly the insidious perils that hung over the grave origins of English prose . Had not Alfred had that instinct for colloquialism , he might easily have been perverted through reading the glossaries in Sweet 's Earliest English Texts or similar organs of pedantry . Thus the infant English language might have been broken down at the outset by the sheer weight of its polysyllabic swaddling clothes . And note that it takes the trained philological imagination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which brings us back to our original contention that , as sciences go , philology is distinctly in the gay division . If a philologist ever seems a dull dog , look out for him . He really is bursting with romance , and if you thwart him he may do you an injury . GAMES AND TALK . In formally opening the new links at Gravesend , the other day , Mr. Arthur Balfour made a short speech about golf . Even his oratorical genius was unequal to saying anything new on the subject , but he did say something that appears not to be true . Deprecating the practice of calling upon a public man  --  already sick unto death with much speaking  --  to make an address on every conceivable occasion , Mr. Balfour contended that speech-making was peculiarly inappropriate to golf , since it was " a game to be played and not to be talked about . " If this was meant for satire , nothing is to be said except that it was too subtle . As a matter of fact , talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game . Ask the despairing wives who have to listen to all the details of the match fought over again at dinner ! Freeman 's disgust at the " chatter about Harriet " was no greater than that of many a non-golfer compelled to listen to endless explanations of the way in which the ball became unplayable on the thirteenth and hung on the edge of the cup on the last hole . Veterans fighting their battles over again are not a circumstance to the long explanations of golf strategy and the " most wonderful shot I ever made , " which go on with inexhaustible zest on club piazzas and around the tables in the cafe . Condemn the inveterate golfer to silence about his favorite sport , and it would lose half its charm . What Mr. Balfour seems to have confused is the rule of taciturnity while actually playing , and the rule of limitless discussion and living the scene over again when the'match is finally lost or won . Strict observers of golf etiquette go over the course like so many Trappists . The tradition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facts without end illustrate it . There were the two old Scotchmen who played a closely-contested round without a word or whisper , until one of them uttered a golfer 's oath as his ball jumped out of the cup on the eighteenth hole . The other turned upon him in a fury at his " unbridled loquacity . " The conviction is generally held that the best players are the most close-mouthed . The man whom Walter Travis defeated in the finals for the British amateur championship wrote afterwards that the American was the most silent golfer he had ever encountered . His single remark to his opponent during the whole thirty-six holes was . " You are driving a very long ball . " This is the kind of golden silence on the links which Mr. Balfour may have had in mind . There is , to be sure , what is known as " conversational golf , " in which contestants are privileged by agreement to keep up a ceaseless patter of , guying and banter between strokes , but that is admitted to be a shameless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most punctilious player , who holds it a sacred obligation to let his words be few in the course of actual play , feels at liberty to overflow when it is ended . Then come the joyous recollections of the exact difficult lie and the astonishing recovery , the long and absorbing post-mortems , the nice pointing out just where the match was lost , the conclusive demonstration that if a wooden club had only been taken instead of an iron , or the ball not fallen into a heel-print in the hazard , a glorious victory would have resulted . There is also the utterly illimitable talk about the make of clubs and style of shoes and stance and swing and grip , which flows on no less fatedly and in much greater volume than Tennyson 's brook . Golf not to be talked about ! Why , it is one of the greatest provocatives to conversation ever brought into this tongue-wagging world . It is true of all popular games that talking about them is inseparable from playing them Fancy what would happen to academic conversation if its one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be taken away . Football gives its chief color to the speech of thousands of undergraduates for weeks and months . Before the season opens , there is the vast discussion of plans and possibilities . While the games are playing , the rising hope of American culture can talk of nothing else . After the last struggle has been fought out , there come the long regrets that its strategy or personnel had not been different ; and the undergraduate mind carries the matter well into the winter , until it is time to enliven the conversation by speculating on the chances of the nine and the crew in the spring . If it were not for games and talk about them , we should not have any of that play of wit and fancy , and that mind sharpening mind , which this athletic age has made such a social staple . No games , no conversation . A young lady of our acquaintance put the case exactly as it is . She was thrown into the company of a college senior , with whom she endeavored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " but only made him uncomfortable . I asked - him about the theatre , but he merely looked blank . I inquired what he thought about politics , but found that he had no thoughts . Then I saw what had to be done , and suggested athletics . Instantly he brightened up , ran on fluently for an hour , and concluded that I was not such a fool as he had feared . " So we see that the game may not be worth the candle , but is certainly worth the talk .
