WHEN the term " soulless corpora- tion " was first coined , it was used to describe the nature of those largest of the then existing commercial organizations , the railroads . They were declared to be all that the dictionary of iniquity involves ? dark , sinister , dishonest associations which robbed the people " right and left , " as the old phrase put it , and gave nothing in return . They were , as the public press continually averred , bribe-givers , land-grabbers , political corruptionists , hard - fisted extortionists , thieves ? in short , everything that an offended and an outraged opposition could invent or devise in the way of descriptive phraseology . To-day the application of the term has broadened considerably- , but the railroads are not by any means exempt . By the masses of the people they are still viewed with suspicion , and everything which they undertake to do is thought to be the evidence of a scheme whereby the people are to he worsted , and the railroad strengthened in its position of opulent despotism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact we may well believe , and yet not injure the subject of the present discussion . If we were to assume that all that has ever been said concerning railroads is absolutely true , the fact that a new policy had been adopted by some roads , looking to a cordial and sympathetic relationship with their public , would be all the more remarkable . For if the public has had nothing save greed and rapacity to expect of its railroads , the sight of the latter adopting a reasonable business policy , whereby they seek to educate and make prosperous the public in order that they in turn may be prosperous , is one which , if not inspiring , is at least optimistic . No corporation is soulless , whatever else may be thought of it , which helps all others in helping itself . The philosophy involved in this statement is the enlivenbig breath of the latest and most successful railroad policy , now being generally adopted . Like many another good idea , this policy originated in the West , and it is there that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There the general freight agent of a road is an official of educational importance . He has associated with him as many as a hundred assistants , who carry out the work of instructing and educating the people in the knowledge that makes for prosperity . He has under him a horticultural agent , who in turn has assistants . There is a poultry agent , a superintendent of dairies , a land inspector , a travelling commercial agent , buyers , salesmen , and so forth , all with assistants , and all working under tire direction of the general freight agent . Through this department the railroads are doing a remarkably broad educational work ? not only of inspecting the land , but of educating the farmers and merchants , and helping them to become wiser and more successful . They give lectures on soil-nutrition and vegetablegrowing , explain conditions and trade shipments , teach poultry-raising and cattlefeeding , organize creameries for the manufacture of cheese and butter , and explain new business methods to merchants who are slow and ignorant in the matter of conducting their affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which buys for cash of all farmers along the route , running poultry - ears , which are scheduled for certain stations on certain days , with cash buyers in charge . On three other roads there are travelling agents who go over the line three times a year , stop at every station , and visit every merchant in the town and every farmer of merchant proclivities in the country . These men make plain the attitude of the railroad toward the citizen , inquire after the state of his business , ask him what his difficulties are , and what , if anything , can be done to strengthen and improve his situation . Lastly , there is a department of sales agents under the general freight agent , which , by individuals , represents the road in the great cities . These latter study the markets , look after incoming shipments , and work for the interests of the merchants and farmers along the line of the road by finding a market for their product . The reward for the road for all this is nothing more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to a successful community . It has been seven years since the first of the roads to adopt the new policy began to reach out and study the social condition of its public , but since then the idea has spread rapidly , until today there is scarcely a road west of Chicago and St. Louis that is not doing more or less educational work among its public . The original movement was dictated by the fact that along great stretches of the line of one road were vacant tracts of land which were excellent for farming purposes , but which were somehow generally ignored . The road decided to make this region profitable to itself by calling attention to its merits and inducing farmers and merchants to settle there . The aid of the United States Department of Agriculture was called in . The ground was tested , and its specific qualities advertised . After that educational pamphlets were prepared , and agents of the road sent into various populous sections of the country to induce individuals to come and take up residence there . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to induce settlement and then leave the settlers to get along as best they could , so a policy of instruction and assistance was inaugurated . The road undertook to organize enterprises which should utilize the natural resources and production of the country and pat ready money into the hands of the farmers . As a result , it found that it would need to discover markets for the goods manufactured , or it would lose much of the advantage of its labor , and thus came about the present policy , winch is nothing if not broad . Its success has stimulated imitation to such an extent that nearly all roads have some one of the many features of the first road-in operation , and several have all of them . So general has the feeling among railroad men become that the new policy is themore natural and more profitable one , that a certain general manager felt called upon to apologize for the backwardness of his road by explaining that the general freight agent was of the old school of thought and not suited for the place . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attitude of his road toward its public , saying : To reach the man who is trying to do something is our object . The man with energy is our friend . I am not talking now about the man who has fifty or a hundred thousand dollars . He can take care of himself . I refer to the man who has little or nothing , but who wants to have something ; the man who is ambitious and willing to work . Such men need encouragement , and they will get it if they are a part of our public . We have found that if ire are to be prosperous our people must be prosperous , and so the welfare of every single individual in our territory becomes our welfare . That is business . " " But , " I asked , " can a railroad deal with all of the individual members of its public ? " " Yes and no . It can deal with a great many individually . With more it deals collectively , but the result is the same . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railroad gives a series of lectures on tomato-growing , it might be said to be dealing collectively with its public , and yet every farmer might have the benefit of personal counsel with the lecturer . Our aim is to reach the individuals , whether ire do it collectively or not . " A railroad paying for lectures on tomato-growing ! Shades of Mark Hopkins and Jay Gould ! " And why not ? " said the general freight agent of another , a large Southwestern line which reaches Texas and New Mexico , " If the land is good for growing tomatoes , the farmers ought to be instructed . We have found that . our road would be a great deal better if the farmers used their land for the purposes for which it is best fitted . If they do that , their crops are larger . It is our business to instruct them in the matter of soils and crops , and aid them in finding a market . " The instruction of farmers in the matter of soils and crops certainly has been anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to-day we arc told that it is good business . The agent for the inspection of land now makes it his business to discover just - what the nature of the soil along the line of the railroad is , and what can be grown upon it . In this labor he has the co-operation not only of the national , but the State agricultural bureaus of the State through which his line travels . The government is only too anxious to spread information on this subject among the people , and gladly furnishes reports upon the nature of soils anywhere in the United States when requested . It also willingly analyzes specimens of soil and conducts agricultural experiments . The knowledge thus gathered is used by the road in several ways . In the first place , in discovering what certain soils are good for , it picks out the thing which is least grown and is in greatest demand . The general freight agent will say to his horticultural agent : ? " I see by this report here that the land around Denison , Texas , is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring good prices . Why could n't we induce the farmers down there to go into the tomato business ? It would be a great thing for that section . " The horticultural agent immediately takes the reports concerning the land about Denison and sends an agent into the country . Meetings . of the farmers are called , and the nature of the land and the profit of tomato-growing explained . " Now , " says the horticultural agent , " you gentlemen are raising wheat on your land , and getting , say , sixty cents a bushel , if the market is fair . If not , you get less , or hold your wheat and wait for your money . Now this land about here has been tested , not only by the State , but by the United States Agricultural Department , and it is found that it is much better adapted to the growing of tomatoes . It will do a great deal better planted in tomatoes than it will in wheat . Besides , our agents in other places inform us that tomatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will command a dollar a crate . Allowing for the freightage and the cost . of the packing-cases , which we will secure for you at the lowest possible rates , you still have forty cents on the crate . An acre of this ground will yield , say , a hundred and twenty crates at forty cents . Figure for yourselves , genVet . C. ? No. 597. - 55tlemen . Only remember the railroad guarantees you your market . You are not , as in the case of wheat , competing with a million other growers in your own country . You have something out of which you should make fifteen per cent . more on the acre easily . " The result of such lectures and conferences is that , with the aid and advice of the agent , the whole region is turned to tomato-growing . The general freight , de -- partment keeps track of the progress of the crop . Through its representatives in the large and medium-sized cities it finds out where a number of car-loads of tomatoes will command a high marketrate . The local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them to deliver so many crates at a given time . The result is that the crop of the section is readily marketed and the region about Denison improved . The farmers , having slightly more ready money , indulge in farm or personal improvements , with the result that the whole district about Denison is enlivened and trade increased . The rail ? oad profits in every way , not only by the new supplies that are shipped in to Meet an aroused demand , but by the travel of the man who has a few cents more to expend on car fare in looking after his interests or visiting his friends . The above is no hypothetical case , but an actual recorded occurrence , The region affected was that which lies sixty miles east and west of Trinity , Texas . The general freight agent who engineered this successful local enterprise said : " We study the market question before we go into any region with any such proposition . We want our farmers to succeed , not fail . They will avoid an uncertainty as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northern markets . We move them in car-loads only . We have people in the cities who are practical commission men , who have not only knowledge of the commission business , but also ? have knowledge of the trade , After we have secured the information as to where the tomatoes will be available , our horticultural agent , on the ground with the farmers , helps them decide where they will ship . " Such a tale may not only be recorded of tomatoes . The same general freight agent remarked : " In addition to that success , our horiicultural department is encouraging some sections , where the soil is adapted to it , to plant early cabbage . We want the farmers to make the best use of their land . Half the time they do n't know ; the other half they ca n't do anything because they have no way of reaching a market . With our knowledge of markets we can easily encourage them . Why , just the other day one of my men was in here , and I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single station in Missouri : go out and see the farmers , and see what you can do with the development of the potato business . ' We find that the soil along the Missouri River is particularly adapted to raising potatoes . Now I warrant you that our farmers along the Missouri will make more money out of potatoes in a year or two than they ever have made out of their other crops . We will show them how . " In looking over the Missouri Labor Commissioners ' map , one finds that in 1898 there were 70,081,267 surplus pounds of poultry shipped out of the State , an increase of 18,267,743 over 1897 . In the same year 4,081.833 pounds of butter were exported , an increase of 162,866 pounds over 1897 ; and in the matter of eggs , 33 , - 935.325 dozen were shipped , showing a substantial increase over previous years . Those figures tell an interesting story of the new railroad policy now in force , and the growth can be directly traced to the policy in question . The dairy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs , has been energetically promoted by two great roads leading out of St. Louis , and encouraged in a moderate way by several others . This fact is attested by the presence in the State of twoseore or more of flourishing creameries , scattered throughout the counties , which were organized and built by the railroads , though the latter do not hold a single share of stock in any of them . The original idea was suggested , the meetings called , the money raised , and the buildings erected under the supervision of one or the other agent of the several general freight departments of the roads , Even the machinery was purchased in every case for the farmers by the railroad agent , and the method of conducting a dairy taught by another representative of the road free of charge , and all to make the county prosperous , in order that the railroad might be prosperous . In this connection , the following letter , which was the beginning of one railroad 's work of establishing creameries , explains itself . It was sent out some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadened considerably : Sr. Louis , liaison-al , Xovember 7 , /899 . DEAR SIR , ? With the view of developing the milk and dairy business along our line , and with the idea of determining whether or not such a business could be developed if the proper train service was established , I wish you would canvass the situation contiguous to your station , and lot me know how many people you can interest in this business , and the number of cows each of them would be willing to keep and supply milk for shipping or creamery purposes . The stations on the St. Loins Division are close enough to this market. , if the people along the line will furnish volume to justify our potting forth every possible effort to develop this truffle . It would mean the bringing of a great deal more money into the community than can possibly he obtained by ordinary farming , and if we can laud assistance to the encouragement and development of this class of traffic , the results will be not only beneficial to the people along our flue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter that we desire you give your personal attention to , in the way of making a thorough and complete canvass ; and when this is made , give us a full and complete report of the situation , at the earliest practicable date , with names of those who will supply milk , and the number of cows they will keep . The good effect of the initiative action of the railroad in this matter is difficult to understand fully unless the territory is visited in person . These prosperous creamery plants would scarcely have been started by the farmers themselves . It takes thorough knowledge of dairy control to make butter and cheese , and after the same is made , only a broad understanding of the market conditions throughout the country will make it profitable . Very few farmers possess this knowledge , and yet the stockholders in these enterprises are all farmers . The railroads have been instruments in getting them together , of instructing them in the matter of manufacture and markets , and of developing that confidence which would cause them to invest their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region where suspicion of a railroad 's motives and opposition to corporations are exceedingly common . The officer in charge of the department of dairy promotion and control is invariably a gentleman who has had practical as well as scientific training in the matter which he promotes . He is a man who is in thorough sympathy with the movement which the government has inaugurated , of educating the farmer , and avails himself of every document and paper relating to wiser and more economical farm methods . When he takes the field , it is with the set purpose of instructing the farmer concerning things of which he knows little or nothing , and a better understanding of which will make 111 ( 11 more successful . One such agent will enter a backward county , accompanied , as a rule , by some representative of the State Dairy Association , and will begin a campaign of practical education . He will visit the leading farmers , explain to them the advantage of some manufacturing plant of this sort which would use up the surplus dairy products of the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask their co-operation , post notices of a meeting , and by his individual efforts get out as many as fifty farmers at least . Before these collectively he will again lay the proposition , with a clear statement of the railroad 's interest in the matter , and its willingness to aid , to the end that the plant may be most economically established , a proper market assured , and a reasonable degree of profit guaranteed . When this is done , a proof of good faith is not wanting in the way of the free services of an employe of the company , who shall stay on the ground , supervise the erection of the building and the instalment of machinery . He is also left to run the plant until a representative selected by the stockholders is sufficiently instructed to conduct the plant alone . These dairies consume from 3000 to 5000 pounds of mills a day . and yield fifty stockholders from fifteen to forty dollars , according to the number of cows maintained , The best markets for the product are readily indicated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say the least , encouraging . " Why do you interest yourself in this phase of industry ? " was asked of the general freight agent of one of the foremost roads of the West . " Because , " he returned , it is a business which is close to the welfare of ' thefarmer . The creamery business gives the farmer ready money , and it gives it to lino regularly once a month . They have a system in these co-operative creameries which looks to the collection of the money monthly for the product , and disburses it as regularly through the man in charge . In some cases , however , they have a manager who is a buttermaker , sometimes a combination butter and cheese maker . We find that these creameries are splendid things for some counties where no high-priced vegetable can be grown abundantly . Some of our poor territory has been exceedingly improved by the introduction of these creameries . A ready market for milk , such as a creamery is , induces a farmer to keep cows , The latter are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crops of the district increase in value . By a rounda'aout process we profit more than you would imagine . " " Do you get all the freight business of these creameries ? " " Not always . As a matter of fact , the business we get from these small creameries does not amount to anything . In some cases we do not get anything directly , The entire business may go by express . But the community prospers , and we prosper with it . The farmer , with ready money , buys more goods , with the result suggested . " " How many dairies has your road been instrumental in organizing 1 " " " Some fifteen , in all . We organized the dairies at Leeton , Montrose , Rockville , St. Paul ( Missouri ) , Parsons , Americus , Dunlap , Burlington , and so on ; but I do not remember all the names . " " Do they ship dairy products only to the big cities which you reach ? " " Oh no . To the best market they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon request . We have agents in all of the large cities , who study the markets . Some of the business goes to Texas , some to St. Louis , some to Kansas City . It depends largely on the demand at the various points . " The same methods hold in regard to the poultry business , which has been similarly developed . The railroads have been exceedingly successful in this work , and have spread considerable information concerning it among their public . Not only have they . advised , but their agents have taken hold of several small enterprises of this kind and personally conducted them , in order to show the owners new ways and better markets . One road , traversing the West out of St. Louis , in order to stimulate interest in this field and to bring ready money into the territory , has undertaken the collection and sale of poultry on its own account , running poultry-cars over the road , buying for cash at the various stations , and finding its own market in the large cities of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go over the road every week or ten days and paste up notices on the depot bulletin-board , announcing that on such a day the poultry-car of the Great National will be at this station , and will buy all poultry brought forward , at eight or ten cents per pound , cash . This affords a market which is a most excellent thing for many farmers , and aids wonderfully in building up a prosperous community . This policy is one which reaches every enterprise and every individual in its territory , where possible . The man who has a small flour-mill , doing a business of , say , four hundred barrels a year , is some morning confronted by a representative of the railroad , who makes inquiry after his welfare . " You have a plant here of how large a capacity ? " " Eight hundred barrels . " " And you do a business of how much ? " " Four hundred barrels . " " Could you buy wheat about here for four hundred extra barrels at a reasonable figure ? " The probabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au itemized statement of the best you can do on four hundred barrels , to he delivered within six months ? Send us a sample of the flour , and we will see what we can do . " The company has a telegraph arrangement whereby the transmission of ten words cost but a cent , or less . It communicates with its agents at the large cities throughout the country : " What . can you do with four hundred barrels of flour , or any fraction thereof , XX grade , $3 80 per barrel , delivered at the lowest figure ? " The local agent in New York uses his telephone to consult with the local commission merchants . He finds a place for sixty barrels delivered on a certain date . Another agent , in Chicago , wires that he NTIILY MAGAZINE . can use a hundred barrels . The Pittsburg representative can accommodate seventyfive barrels at a price which leaves a fair margin for freightages . " Start your mill , " advises the railroad company , " and deliver us four hundred barrels in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a farm or a small business is made to feel that he can call on the local agent and get advice and aid which will be valuable to him . If he is a farmer , lie may sometimes have something for which there is no local market ? a surplus of vegetables or fruit , which will rot on his hands . Such a man can call on the local agent , lay the matter before him , and receive all the aid that the road can give him . For instance , a farmer in Crawford County , at the close of the last fruit season , had a lot of fifty barrels of apples , which were worth nothing locally , and which were about to spoil . lie visited the local agent and explained the case . The latter informed the general office by telegraph . From there the representatives of the road in the several cities were called up : " What can you do with a lot of fifty barrels of apples for immediate delivery ? " One city quoted fifty cents a barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular instance the New York agent wired that lie could get ninety-five cents per barrel , and the apples were at once shipped to that city , bringing the farmer an agreeable sum of money for something which would otherwise have been a dead loss . The old idea that railroads could concern themselves solely with their own advancement and draw upon the energy of every one else without making any adequate return still holds . in many quarters , but the tide is turning . There are railroads and railroads , but the majority of the more successful ones have inaugurated this policy . " If we can make it clear to our public why we do as we do , " said one railroad Official " without overdrawing the results to them or underestimating the benefits to ourselies , we are never iu doubt of the effect . Suspicion of the motives , especially when honest , is one of the most injurious elements a railroad has to contend with , "                 @ @ @ @
