txt The Wick and Not the Oil . If you think a reply to Mr. F. W. Seward 's question in re Standard 011 ( to-day 's issue , ) is of any interest to your readers , tell them as follows : In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the failure of the average lamp to continue to burn after two-thirds of the oil has been consumed , rests entirely with the condition of the wick and " general cleanliness . " I have poured many a last third from a. dirty lamp into a clean one , adjusted a fresh wick , and proved to the complaining housewife that the oil was not at fault , not watered . Go after the manufacturers of wicks sometimes , and more often ask Mary Ann to clean up her lamp , ( alkali dust , bugs , flies , dirt , ) and aecessorigs . Standard Oil kerosene in a clean lamp with feeding wick will burn in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred to the last drop .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
