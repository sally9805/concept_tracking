txt The interest of public men generally , : sad of naval men in particular , centred I yesterday in the denial of ex-Ambassador Andrew D. White that he , when Am-bassador at Berlin , bad suggested ' the attitude of the German naval squadron under Admiral Diederichs at Manila , which resulted in an apparent attempt to block the work of Admiral Dewey . The denial , which appeared in THE TIMES of yesterday , was made in answer to explanations offered concerning the speech delivered , April 8 by Melville E. Stone at Herman Bidder 's dinner to Ambassador Tower . In ! his speech Mr. Stone declared that we had not been quite fair with Germany in several matters , and that one of those matters was the Diederichs episode . Mr. Stone was averse to discussing the subject further yesterday . The published extract from hig speech was correct , he said , and he had no additional comments to make . . Senator John C. Spooner of ' Wisconsin said that he had heard , the story before , but that he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White had to say about it . Further than this he would not talk . At the navy yard Rear Admiral Coghlan , who bore a prominent part in the battle of Manila Bay , and whose famous " Hoch der Kaiser " speech was an outcome of the Diederichs episode . could not be seen . The Staats-Zeitung 's Account of It . In this morning 's issue of the StaatsZeitung , the Manila Bay incident is discussed at length in the editorial columns of that paper . That editorial , which it Is stated gives the facts in the case , in part is as follows : " On May 1 . 189S , Admiral Dewey attrrcked and destroyed the Spanish fleet . . At that time there were a large number . of German merchants in business in the , . City of Manila . There was a great deal of confusion there , and these merchants were naturally apprehensive as to their lives and property . Prince Henry of Prussia was at Hongkong , and a delegation went to him and urged that some German vessels should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . This request Prince ' Hears , cabled at once to Berlin . r:sssorsny Acted . " At that moment , and indeed for many months after , there was no popular yen- : timent in the United States in favor of permanently holding the Philippines or rankling them colonial possessions of this : country . Indeed , one who had full authority to speak for the American Gov-ernment assured the authorities at Ber-lin that the war must hot be construed into a contest for territorial aggrandisement-Th-01d asked why Germany would not take the islands . This was taken as an official communication . He also communicated this suggestion to the State Department at Washington , where it was not favorably received . The German Government was not informed as to the feeling at Washington , and for the moment accepted the suggestion as expressive of the American point of view . They were veil , uncertain , however , as to their desires in the matter . The German merchants at Manila were very urgent that the United States should assume and maintain sovereignty in the islands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ' Understand . " It was with the suggestion from this American authority before them that on May 11 Admiral Diederichs was instructed to go from Hongkong to Manila . . The English sent a like fleet under Capt . Sir Edward Chichester . Admiral Dewey , knew nothing of what had been going on at Berlin . Admiral Diederichs had been led to believe that the United States did not want the Philippines , and would be very glad indeed if Germany would take them off her hands . These two different points of view inevitably found expression in the actions of the two Admirals . " It Diederichs seemed at all officious his ' justification lies in the fact that his Government had , through no fault of its own , been misled . It is also true that for - motives of their own certain American and foreign newspapers greatly exaggerated the episode , charging Diederichs with many things of which he was not guilty , and crediting the English officers . with a degree of friendship for which there was no warrant . " On July 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than whom no Man knows the facts better , said : ' I feel bound to acknowledge the conduct of those in authority  --  those who represent Germany to our country and who have been all that we could desire from the ' first during the war . The German Gov-ernment recognized at the outset our full rights as belligerents. it has observed al strict and full neutrality ; and this neutrality has been neither cold nor grudged . There has been no request made by our Government which has , not been met promptly and freely . ' iliere have been occasions when , had there been a wish on the part of the rulers . of Germany to check our career , delays and evasions might have taken place , but there have I been neither delays nor evasions . ' " The German Government has acted most tactfully respecting this whole mat.ter . Although frequently criticised in this : country , they have maintained a dignified silence , and have never disclosed the authoritative suggestions made to them that we did not want the Philippines , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany 's Attitude . at Portsmouth . The editorial also discusses Emperor William 's connection with the Portsmouth Peace Conference , and declares that it is untrue that the Kaiser , as reported , had advised the Czar to continue the ' War with Japan . Along this line the editorial reads : " BAs to the Portsmouth Peace Conference , it was asserted at the time that the German Emperor was endeavoring to ; have the Czar go on , with the war . The : rvery contrary is true . It was in the days of the third , week of August , 1905 , when the negotiations suddenly began to lag and there was grave danger that they would be broken off altogether . It seemed as if the influence of President Roosevelt was about to fill . Count Witte and Baron Rosen had received definite instructions from St. Petersburg to withdraw from , the conference on the following Tuesday . At this critieaisjuncture the President addressed Emperor William II . by cable , invoking his aid to bring about a satisfactory result of the peace negotiations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the satisfactory result was then accomplished in Portsmouth on Aug. 28 . Such Is the share which Emperor William had in the peace of Portsmouth between - Russia and Japan . He has , indeed , played a much greater part and contributed more to the cause , of peace than has hitherto been known . This means no detraction from the great merits of President Roosevelt , who has , indeed , himself openly and expressly borne witness to the co-operation of the Emperor . " Since the day of Manila and its subsequent unfriendly sentiment of the American people against Germany a mighty change has taken  --  place . The distrust has disappeared . A good start has been made for a better mutual understanding . Relations have become friendly . To further strengthen the bonds of friendship and to show . how unfounded was the former distrust and to prove that President and Emperor joined hands in promoting the work of peace these revelations about the secret history of Manila ' and the share of the German Emperor in the bringing about of the peace at Porta1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest upon a stronger bulwark than the friendly union of the German and the American Nations .
