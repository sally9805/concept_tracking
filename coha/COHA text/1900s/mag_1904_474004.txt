MANY fine things have been said on Commencement flays about " The American Scholar , " " The Value of Learning , " " The Influence of Universities , " " The Woman 's College , " and other subjects bearing on the relation of education to life . But the most important thing , the key-word of the problem , which needs not only to be said , but also to be understood and remembered , is that Life itself is the Great School . The whole framework of things visible and invisible , wherein we mysteriously find ourselves perceiving . reflecting , reasoning , desiring , choosing , and acting , is designed and fitted ( so far at least as it concerns us and reveals itself to us ) to be a place of training and enlightenment for the human race through the unfolding and development of human persons like you and me . For no other purpose are these wondrous potencies of perception and emotion , thought and will , housed within walls of flesh and shut in by doors of sense , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out . For no other purpose are we beset with attractions and repulsions , obstacles and allurements , helps and hardships , tasks , duties , pleasures , persons , books , machines , plants , animals , houses , forests , storm and sunshine , water fresh and salt , fire wild and tame , a various earth , a mutable heaven , and an intricate humanity , but that we may be instructed in the nature of things and people , and rise by knowledge and sympathy into a fuller and finer life . Facts are teachers . Experiences arc lessons . Friends are guides . Teaching itself is a method of learning . Work is a master . Love is an interpreter . Joy carries a divining-rod and discovers hidden fountains . Sorrow is an astronomer and shows us the stars . What I have lived I really know ; and what I really know I partly own ( partly , because the beginning of knowledge is the perceptionof its own limits ) ; and so begirt with what I know and what I own , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but what I learn , at once instructed and examined by every duty and every pleasure . It is a mistake to say , " To-day education ends ; to-morrow life begins . " The process is continuous : the idea into the thought , the thought into the action , the action into the character . When the mulberry seed falls into the ground and germinates , it begins to be transformed into silk . This view of life as a process of education was held by the two great races of antiquity ? the two races in whose deep hearts the stream of modern progress takes its rise ? the two races whose energy of spirit and strength of self-restraint have kept the world from sinking into the dream-lit torpor of the mystic East , or whirling into the blind , restless activity of the barbarian West . What is it but the idea of the School of Life that sings through the words of the Hebrew psalmist ? ? " I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse or as the mule , whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come . near unto thee . " This warning against the mulish attitude which turns life into a process of punishment , ? this praise of the eye-method which is the triumph of teaching , ? these are the notes of a wonderful and world-wide school . It is the same view of life that shines through Plato 's noble words : " This , then , must be our notion of the just man , that even when he is in poverty or sickness , or any other seeming misfortune , all things in the end work together for good to him in life and death ; for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like God , as far as man can attain His likeness , by the pursuit of virtue . " Not always , indeed , does the Greek use so strong an ethical emphasis . For him the dominant idea is the unfolding of reason , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal is a man who sees things as they are , and understands their nature , and feels beauty , and follows truth . It is the Hebrew who hammers home the nail of righteousness . The foundations of his school are the tablets on which the Divine Law is inscribed . The ideal of his education is the power to distinguish between good and evil , and the will to choose the good , and the strength to stand by it . Life , to his apprehension , fulfils its purpose in the development of a man who walks uprightly and keeps the Commandments . Aschylus and Ezekiel lived in the same century . Reason and Righteousness : what more can the process of life do to justify itself than to unfold these two splendid flowers on the tree of our humanity ? What third idea is there that the third great race , the Anglo-Saxon , may conceive , and cherish , and bring to blossom and fruition ? There is only one the idea of Service . Too much the sweet reasonableness of the Greek ideal tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hebrew ideal gave shelter to the microbe of Pharisaism . It was left for the Anglo-Saxon race , quickened by the new word and the new life of a Divine Teacher , to claim for the seed an equal glory with the flower and the fruit : to perceive that righteousness is not reasonable , and reason is not righteous , unless they are both communicable and serviceable ; to say that the highest result of our human experience is to bring forth finer and better men and women able and willing to give of that which makes them better to the world in which they live . This is the ultimate word concerning the School of Life . I catch its inspiring note in the question of that very noble gentleman , Sir Philip Sidney , who said , " To what purpose should our thoughts be directed to various kinds of knowledge unless room be afforded for putting it into practice , so that public advantage be the result ? " This , then , is what the education of life is to bring out : Reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the school , what becomes of our colleges and universities ? They are , or they ought to be , simply preparatory institutions to fit us to go on with our education . Not what do they teach , but how do they prepare us to learn ? ? that is the important question . I measure a college not by the height of its towers , nor by the length of its examination papers , nor by the pride of its professors , but chiefly by . the docility of its graduates . I do not ask , where did you leave off , but are you ready to go on ? Graduation is not a stepping-out ; it is either a stepping-up , ? gradu ad gradum , ? a promotion to a higher class , or a dropping to a lower one . The cause for which a student is dropped may be invincible ignorance , Incurable frivolity , or obstructive and constrictive learning . " One of the benefits of a college education , " says Emerson , " is to show a boy its little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Webster were college men . But Franklin and Washington and Marshall and Clay and Lincoln were not . A college education is good for those who can digest it . The academic atmosphere has its dangers , of which the greatest are a certain illusion of infallibility , a certain fever of intellectual jealousy , and a certain dry idolatry of schedules and programmes . But these infirmities hardly touch the mass of students , busy with their athletics , their societies , their youthful pleasures . The few who arc affected more seriously are usually cured by contact with the larger world . Most of the chronic eases occur among those who really never leave the preparatory institution . but pass from the class to the instructor 's chair , and from that to the professorial cathedra , and so along the spiral , bounded ever by the same curve and steadily narrowed inward , Specialists we must have , and to-day we are told that a successful specialist must give his whole life to the study of the viscosity of electricity , or the value of the participial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a secluded and cloistered life may be necessary . But let us have room also in our colleges for teachers who have been out in the world , and touched life on different sides , and taken part in various labors , and carried burdens , and been buffeted , and learned how other men live , and what they need . Great is the specialist and precious ! but I think we still have a use for masters of the old type , who knew many things , and were broadened by experience . and had the power of vital inspiration , and could start their pupils onward and upward through the struggles and triumphs of a lifelong education . There is much discussion nowadays of the subjects which may be , or perhaps must be , taught in a college . A part , at least , of the controversy is futile . For the main problem is not one of subjects , but of aim and method . " Liberal studies , " says one of the finest of living English teachers , " pursued in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth . " There are two ways of teaching any subject : one opens the mind , the other closes it . The mastery of the way to do things is the accomplishment that counts for future work . I like the teacher who shows me , not merely where he stands , but how he gut there , and encourages and equips me to find my own way through the maze of books and the tangled thickets of human opinion . Rules are good , and definitions arc useful , and a supply of sound and trustworthy judgments on various subjects is like a traveller 's stock of condensed provisions : but best of all is a knowledge of the art of travel , how to use maps and follow indications , how to choose the best road and keep it , to get the good of the journey and reach the goal . Let us keep our colleges and universities true to their function , which is preparatory and not final . Let us not ask of them a yearly output of " finished scholars . " The very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He who can learn no more has not really learned anything . What we want is not finished scholars but equipped learners ; minds that can give and take ; intellects not cast in a mould but masters of a method ; people who are ready to go forward wisely toward a larger wisdom . The chief benefit that a good student may get in a good college is not a definite amount of Greek and Latin , mathematics and chemistry , botany and zoology , history and logic , though this in itself is good . But far better is the power to apprehend and distinguish , to weigh evidence and interpret facts , to think clearly , to infer carefully , to imagine vividly . Best of all is a sense of the unity of knowledge , a reverence for the naked truth , a perception of the variety of beauty , a feeling of the significance of literature , and a wider sympathy with the upward-striving , dimly groping , perplexed , and dauntless life of man . I will not ask whether such a result of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to command a larger wage in the market - place , whether it opens the door to wealth , or fame , or social distinction ; nor even whether it increases the chance of winning a place in the aristocracy of " Who 's Who . " These questions are treasonable to the very idea of education , which aims not at a marketable product , but at a vital development . The one thing certain and important is that those who are really nurtured and disciplined and enlightened in any collage enter the School of Life with an advantage . They are " well prepared , " as we say . They are fitted to go on with their education in reason and righteousness and service , under the Great Master . I do not hold with the modern epigram that " the true university is a library . " Through the vast wilderness of books flows the slender stream of literature , and often there is need of guidance to find and follow it . Only a genius or an angel can safely be turned loose in a library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reading that is little better than an idle habit , a substitute for thought . Of many books it may be said that they are nothing but the echoes of echoing echoes . If a good book be , as Milton said , " the precious life-blood of a master spirit , embalmed and treasured , " still the sacred relic , as in the vial of St. Januarius at Naples , remains solid and immovable . It needs a kind of miracle to make it liquefy and flow , ? the miracle of interpretation and inspiration , ? wrought most often by the living voice of a wise master , communicating to the young heart the wonderful secret that some books are alive . Never shall I forget the " Open Sesame " which I first heard in the reading of Milton 's Comas by my father , and of Cicero 's Letters by my old Latin professor . The Greeks learned the alphabet from the Phoenicians . But the Fhcenicians used it for contracts , bills of lading , and accounts ; the Greeks for poetry and philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Literature is of one kind only the interpretation of life and nature , through the imagination , in clear and personal words of power and charm ; and this is for reading . To get the good of the library in the School of Life you must bring into it something better than a mere taste for reading . You must bring the power to read , between the lines , behind the words , beyond the horizon of the printed page . St. Philip 's question to the Chamberlain of Ethiopia was crucial : " Understandest thou what thou readest ? ' ' I want hooks not to pass the time , but to fill it with beautiful thoughts and images , to enlarge my world , to give me new friends in the spirit , to purify my ideals and make them clear , to show me the local color of unknown regions and the bright stars of immortal truth . Time is wasted if we read too much looking-glass fiction , books about our own class and place and period , stories of American college life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated and our own prejudices are embodicd , ? kodak prints , gramophone cylinders . I prefer the real voice , the visible face , things which I can see and hear for myself without waiting for Miss Arabella Tompkins 's report of them . I wish to go abroad , to hear new messages , to meet new people , to get a fresh point of view , to revisit other egos , to listen to the oracles of Delphi and drink deep of the springs of Pieria . The only writer who can tell me anything of real value about my familiar environment is the genius who shows me that , after all , it is not familiar , but strange , wonderful , crowded with secrets unguessed and possibilities unrealized . The two things best worth writing about in poetry and fiction are the symbols of nature and the passions of the human heart . I want also an essayist who will clarify life by gentle illumination and lambent humor ; a philosopher who will help me see the reason of things apparently unreasonable ; a historian who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a biographer who will let me touch the hand of the great and the good . This is the magic of literature . This is how real books help to educate us in the School of Life . There is no less virtue , but rather more , in events , tasks , duties , obligations , to unfold and develop our nature . The difference is not between working people and thinking people , but between people who work without thinking and people who think while they work . What is it that you have to do ? To weave cloth , to grow fruit , to sell bread , to make a fire , to prepare food , to nurse the sick , to keep house ? It matters not . Your task brings you the first lesson of reason , ? that you must deal with things as they are , not as you imagine them or desire them to be . Wet wood will not burn . Fruit-trees must have sunshine . Heavy bread will not sell . Sick people have whims . Empty cupboards yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platitudes , no doubt ; but worth more for education than many a metaphysical theory or romantic dream . For when we face these things and realize their meaning , they lead us out of the folly of trying to live in such a world as we would like it to be , and make us live in the world which is . " Let us follow the argument whithersoever it leads us , " said Plato . That was the spirit that made Greek philosophy triumphant . Let us deal with the facts in their unmistakable verity . That is the spirit that makes a reasonable , fearless , temperate , serviceable manhood and womanhood . Orchids feed on air : apple-trees , on earth . Men and women grow when they are rooted in reality . The mystic visions of the Orient are a splendid pageant . But for guidance I follow Socrates , whose gods were too noble to deceive or masquerade , whose world was a substantial embodiment of divine ideals , and whose men and women were not playthings of Chance or Fate , but living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory . I do not wish to stay with the nurse and hear fairy - tales . I submit to the School of Life . In the presence of the mysteries of pain and suffering , under the pressure of disaster and disease , I turn not for counsel to some Scythian soothsayer , but to a calm , wise teacher like Hippocrates , who says : " As for me I think that these maladies are divine like all others , but that none is more divine or more human than another . Each has its natural principle , and none exists without its natural cause . " The spirit which faces the facts is intellectual fortitude . And fortitude is the sentinel and guardian virtue ; without it all the other virtues are in peril . Daring is inborn , and often born blind . Ent fortitude is implanted , nurtured , unfolded in the School of Life . I praise the marvellous courage of the human heart , enduring evils , facing perplexities , overcoming obstacles , rising after a hundred falls , building up what gravity pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires , and hoping all things . I find fault with Byron 's line , " fair women and brave men , " ? for women are not less brave than men , but often more , though in a different way . Life itself takes them in hand , these delicate and gracious creatures , and if they are worthy and willing , true scholars of experience , educates them in a heroism of the heart , which suffers all the more splendidly because it is sensitive , and conquers fear all the - more gloriously because it is timorous . The obstinacy of the materials with which we have to deal , in all kinds of human work , has an educational value . Some one has called it " the total depravity of inanimate things . " The phrase would be final if depravity could be conceived as beneficent . No doubt a world in which matter never got out of place and became dirt ; in which iron had no flaws and wood no cracks ; in which gardens had no weeds and food grew ready cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easy as the advertisements describe it ; in which the right word was not hard to find , and rules had no exceptions , and things never went wrong , would be a much easier world to live in . But for purposes of training and development it would be worth nothing at all . It is the resistance that puts us on our mettle : it is the conquest of the reluctant stuff that educates the worker . I wish you enough difficulties to keep you well and make you strong and skilful . No one can get the full benefit of the School of Life who does not welcome the silent and deep instruction of Nature . This earth on which we live , these heavens above us , these dumb companions of our work and play , this wondrous living furniture and blossoming drapery of our school-room , ? all have their lessons to impart . But they will not do their teaching swiftly and suddenly ; they will not let us master their meaning in a single course , or sum it all up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with delicate confidences , as if they would prolong the instruction that we may not forsake their companionship , they yield up their significance to the student who loves them . The scientific study of nature is often commended on merely practical grounds . I would honor and praise it for higher reasons , for its power to train the senses in the habit of veracious observation , for its corrective influence upon the audacity of a logic which would attempt to evolve the camel from the inner consciousness of a philosopher , for its steadying , quieting effect upon the mind . Poets have indulged too often in supercilious sneers at the man of science , the natural philosopher . Thus Wordsworth calls him " a fingering slave , One that would peep and botanize Upon his mother 's grave . " The contempt is ill founded ; the sneer is indiscriminate . It is as if one should speak of the poet as A man of trifling breath , One that would flute and sonneteer About his sweetheart 's death . Is there any more danger of narrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the investigation of ancient documents and annals , or the study of tropes , metaphors , and metres ? Is it only among men of science that we can find pettiness , and irascibility , and domineering omniscience ; or do they sometimes occur among historians and poets ? It seems to me that there are no more serene and admirable intelligences than those which are often found among the true naturalists . How fine and enviable is their lifelong pursuit of their chosen subject . What mind could be happier in its kingdom than that of an Agassiz or a Guyot ? What life more beautiful and satisfying than that of a Linnteus or an Audubon ? But for most of us these advanced courses are impossible ; what we must content ourselves with is not really worthy to be called nature-study ; it is simply nature-kindergarten . We learn a little about the movement of stars and clouds , a few names of trees and flowers and birds ; some of the many secrets of their life and growth ; just . the words of one syllable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise and teachable , we walk with Nature , and let her breathe into our hearts those lessons of humility , and patience , and confidence , and good cheer , and tranquil resignation , and temperate joy , which are her " moral lore , " ? lessons which lead her scholars onward through a merry youth and a strong maturity and a serene old age , and prepare them by the pure fellowship of this world for the enjoyment of a better . The social environment , the human contact in all its forms , plays a large part in the School of Life . " The city instructs men , " said Simonides . Conversation is an exchange of ideas : this is what distinguishes it from gossip or chatter . The organization of work , the division of labor , implies and should secure a mutual education of the workers . Some day , when this is better understood , the capitalist will be enlightened and the labor-union civilized . Even the vexed problem of domestic service is capable of yielding educational results to those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of fair dealing , the responsibilities of command , the essential difference between a carpet-sweeping machine and the girl who pushes it ; and the servant may learn something of the dignity of doing any kind of work well , and the virtue of self-respecting obedience , and the sweet reasonableness of performing the task that is paid for . I do not think much of the analogy between human society and the beehive Or the ant-hill , which certain writers are now elaborating in symbolistic fashion . It passes over and ignores the vital problem which is ever pressing upon us humans ? the problem of reconciling personal claims with the claims of the race . Among the bees and the ants , so far as we can see , the community is all : the individual is nothing . There are no personal aspirations to suppress ; no conscious conflicts of duty and desire ; no dreams , even , of a better kind of hive , a new and perfected formicary . It is only to repeat themselves , to keep the machine going , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these perfect communisms blindly strive . But human society is less perfect and therefore more promising . The highest achievements of humanity come from something which , so far as we know , bees and ants do not possess : the sense of imperfection , the de'sire of advance . Ideals must be personal before they can become communal . It was not until the rights of the individual were perceived and recognized , including the right to the pursuit of happiness , that the vision of a free and noble state , capable of progress , dawned upon mankind . Life teaches all but the obstinate and mean how to find a place in such a state , and grow therein . A true love of others is twinned with a right love of self ? that is , a love for the better part , the finer , nobler self , the man that is " to arise in me , That the man that I am may cease to be . " Individualism is a fatal poison . But individuality is the salt of the common life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not have to live like it , nor to subsist on its food . You may have your own orchard . You may drink at a hidden spring . Be yourself if you would serve others . Learn also how to appraise criticism , to value enmity , to get the good of being blamed and evil-spoken of . A soft social life is not likely to be very noble . You can hardly tell whether your faiths and feelings are real until they are attacked . But take care that you defend them with an open mind and by right reason . You are entitled to a point of view , but not to announce it as the centre of the universe . Prejudice , more than anything else , robs life of its educational value . I knew a man who maintained that the chief obstacle to the triumph of Christianity was the practice of infant baptism . I heard a woman say that no one who ate with his knife could be a gentleman . Hopeless scholars , these ! What we call society is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the whole world of God 's cheerful , fallible men and women . " It is not only the famous people and the well-dressed people who are worth meeting . It is every one who has something to communicate . The scholar has something to say to me , if he he alive . But I would hear also the traveller , the manufacturer , the soldier , the good workman , the forester , the village school-teacher , the nurse , the quiet observer , the unspoiled child , the skilful housewife . I knew an old German woman , living in a tenement , who said , " My heart is a little garden , and God is planting flowers there . " " II Taut cultiver son jardin , " ? yes , but not only that . One should learn also to enjoy the neighbor 's garden , however small ; the roses straggling over the fence , the scent of lilacs drifting across the road . There is a great complaint nowadays about the complication of life , especially in its social and material aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroys the temper of tranquillity necessary to education . The simple life is recommended ( and rightly ) as a refuge from this trouble . But perhaps we need to understand a little more clearly what simplicity is . It does not consist merely in low ceilings , loose garments , and the absence of brie-A. - brae . Life may be complicated in a log cabin . There is a conventionalism of the Philistines as well as of the Athenians . A country town , with its set formulas of propriety , its minute etiquette , its subtle rivalries , its undercurrents of gossip , and its inveterate convolutions of prejudice , may be as complicated as the Labyrinth itself . The real simplicity is not outward , but inward . It consists in singleness of aim , clearness of vision , directness of purpose , openness of mind , cheerfulness of spirit , sincerity of taste and affection , gentle candor of speech , and loyalty to the best that we know . I have seen it in a hut . I have seen it in a palace . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the School of Life .
