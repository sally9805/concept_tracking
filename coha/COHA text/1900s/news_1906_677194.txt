txt Just why Mr. SHAW should instruct Mr. SCHIST ' regarding a slip in statement by the Chamber of Commerce committee is not apparent upon the face of the correspondence . Perhaps Mr. SHAW did not care to hurt the committee 's feelings by direct instruction ; perhaps Mr. Saaw had nothing better to Say upon the merits , and so seized upon a detail . It is apparent that the principle whether or not it is well that satiation 's currency should be secured upon bonds is unaffected by considerations regarding redemption of currency is whatever slims , and for reasons unconnected with either the volume of bands or the need for currency . The , proposition is that there is a better basis for currency than bonds , and that there are better reasons for expanding or reducing currency circulation than reasons of profit or loss to the issuingl banks . Just so far as Mr. Sa. &w; is corn- mitted to the negative of those prop  --  sit:Lone by Mr. ScaFumr we think he did well in addressing his remarks to another topic . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic , we filfirar it well to say little regarding differences upon detail , lest such differences should give critics the idea that there are no principles involved , and that no agreement is possible upon them . Mr. SHAW expresses his regret that the committee did not go more deeply into the subject . We have heretofore expressed the same opinion , and we may add now our regret that Mr. SHAW did not set the committee an example by himself going deeper into his suggestion of an excess issue of a bond-secured currency . Mr. SHAW having now taken official cognizance of the fact that the banks issue bond-secured currency in a 1 per cent money market , and withdraw that currency in a 100 per cent . market , we should think that the idea of issuing of that sort of currency one-half more than the law allows , because of some temporary need , might be dropped , if there is any alternative . Such an additional issue is subject to all the objections to bond-secured currency in principle , with the further special objections that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for the additional issue , nor any new means of redemption . There is more uncovered currency now in the ' United States than in any other country , and here is a provision for another possible quarter billion without the addition of one dollar of primary money to the banks ' stock . The notes are good as an undivided interest in a portion of the National debt , or as a similar interest in the assets or credit of the entire country . Nobody would asperse the greenbacks or the National banknotes , lest it should hurt some patriot 's feelings , but it is permissible to say that there is a limit to the amount of currency which it is advisable to issue without providing a metallic-basis in sight and pledged to that particular use . Mr. Slaw ingenuously suggests that there is no danger of excessive issue because the crisis was limited to New York . Mr. SHAW also remarks upon the committee 's proposal of enlarging the practicable retirement of bank currency that it makes possible the retirement of the outstanding half billion of banknotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction to absurdity seems at least as applicable to the Secretary 's plan as to the committee 's . That is , there is about as much likelihood of the retirement of a half billion notes as there is of the issue of a quarter billion . Practical men would not lose sleep over either danger . The Frenchman who ranks first in war with his own hand wrote into the charter of the Bank of France , " The notes shall be covered either by coin held by the bank , or by notes secured by collateral , or by notes signed by three responsible persons . " A century has passed and that remains good banking practice . Our own experience would have been brighter had we banked upon such principles . However , it is necessary to admit that our experience has been such , and so strong are the interests intrenched in antagonism that something specific must be pledged to redeem our National banknotes . What is the matter with gold ? Why not saturate our banks with it when it is so plenty ? Controller lineeene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when the - aubject of increasing the reserves of London barar9 was acute after the Baring crisis . It failed in England because of the national dislike to paper money . The objection in England might be a reason for success here . If the proposition were merely to allow banks to issue $1 in notes for $1 in gold it might not be profitable . Suppose it were ? enacted that . National banks might issue $2 in notes for $1 in bullion . This would not be inflation because the banks could not force the issue beyond the needs of the time , and as the nctes would only be given for value received , they would be safe . There would be double the factor of safety so familiar and so satisfactory for the convertibility of deposits . And it might be added that upon payment of a tax the issue might be enlarged to 4 for 1 . Possibly it would be well to substitute the Clearing Houses for the Treasury as agents of issue and redemption . Will the National banks continue to block every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a movement which then they can mold to their wish ?
