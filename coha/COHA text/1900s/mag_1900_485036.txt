In the severe indictment of the Administration for its course in matters growing out of the war with Spain which appeared in the article that President Eliot of Harvard contributed to the Outlook week before last , he deelared that it ' has succumbed deplores bly to a temptation which always besets rulers in time of war  --  the temptation to keep from the people the knowledge not only of future plans , but of past events and of the documentary evidence relating thereto . " The worst illustration of this practice yet brought to light is that which is charged against the President by Chairman Jones of the Democratic National Committee . In his letter of acceptance , Mr. McKinley quoted a part of the secret instructions given by him to the United States Commissioners whom he sent to Paris to negotiate the treaty of peace  --  the part which he used being favorable to the position of his party in the present campaign . On the 5th of October Senator Jones addressed the President a note asking that the remainder of the document should be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mr Jones now very properly tells the story . The public endurance of this suppression should be unaccountable in a free country . The question of civil-service reform does not cut much of a figure in the campaign . President McKinley attracted support from reforniers four years ago because , as a Representative in Congress , he had defended the Civil-Service Law from attacks , but he has forfeited their confidence by repeated surrenders to the spoilsmen since he entered the White House . Bryan , however , seems bent on convincing people that things would only go from bad to worse in this respect if he should become President . In a speech at Washington on.October 23 , he came out in favor of a fixed term for all appointees , including the host of Government clerks . This is in accordance with the plank in the Chicago platform , reaffirmed at Kansas City , which opposed " life-tenure in the public service , " and favored " fixed terms of office " This is simply the old doctrine of " rotation in office , " made compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the four years ' term for collectors , pcistmasters. and other like officials has always been recognized by students of the subject as a great misfortune , and civil-.service reformers are laboring to secure - the abolition of the system . To extend Tit to the minor employees of the Government would be the longest step backward that could be taken . Nothing has done more to cool the feeling of Southern Democrats toward Bryan than his attempts during the closing weeks of the canvass to win the votes of Northern negroes by telling them that the Filipinos are colored people like themselves , that the Re-publican party is trying to deprive them of their liberties , that the only hope for such people is with the Democrats , and that the Republicans have not given the negroes as many offices as they were entitled to have  --  with the implication that they would get more if they should vote the Democratic ticket . With that independence which now characterizes a large portieia of the party press , many Democratic newspapers rebuke the candidate of their party sharply for talking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has bestowed Presidencies on the Republican party and received janitorships in return intended as an implied promise that he would do better by the colored man if he should be made President r asks the Nashville ( Tenn . ) Bamier , and it continues ? " If not , it was mere campaign claptrap , in which a statesman who aspires to the Presidency should not indulge . " As to the larger issue of Southern treatment of the negro , the Banner pronounces the candidate 's disingenuous explanation of recent Constitutional changes " a bold and patent equivocation , such as Mr. Bryan frequently makes , " and thus tells what it considers the truth : " The people of the States where these new Constitutions have been adopted , made no disguise of their desire to get rid of the negro vote , and unless this talk of Mr. Bryan to the negroes be considered as merely the cant of a stump politician , intended to catch votes , it is not such as will appeal to the sympathies of the majority of Southern Democrats . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old curse on the man who leaves nothing unsaid . Those whom stern duty compels to go through it to the bitter end , will feel free to speak in warm terms of its masterly commonplace . All the slain are duly slaughtered once more ; the familiar old documents are brought out with the startled air of a discoverer ; and the President 's townspeople , who , Mr. Root seems to think , must have omitted to read Mr. McKinley 's letter , are refreshed with long extracts from it All this moves on such a dull level of humdrum that we are naturally surprised when we come upon two really brilliant bits of pettifogging . We suppose the temptation was too strong for the great city lawyer when he found himself before a country jury . It is charged , said Secretary Root , that the President asked Congress in December , 1898 , for an increase of the army to 100,000 men : " That , " he added , with an earnest glance ' at the bucolic jury , " was a reduction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Secretary Alger thought he was recommending that the regular army be " Permanently increased , " and that the President himself fell into the extraordinary blunder of telling Congress that the 100,000 men he asked for were for the " permanent increase " of the army ! Mr. Root may perhaps be excused for not having read Secretary Alger 's reports , but he certainly ought to remember what he himself wrote less than a year ago . In December , 1899 , he wished " most strongly to urge that the customs duties between Porto Rico and the United States be removed , " which course , he said ; was demanded by " the highest considerations of justice and good faith . " It must have required a superhuman effort of memory for Secretary Root to forget all this . But he did it completely , and with a grave visage assured the innocent villagers that Congress had passed a law to do exactly what had been recommended . The glib promises of Secretary Root and Philippine Commissioner Worcester that the Filipino fighting will be over as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate comment in the continued Boer fighting . Mr. Chamberlain made exactly the same complaint about the South African hostilities that the Republicans make about the Philippine . " The Boers refuse to surrender , " said Mr. Chamberlain angrily , " only because they doubt whether the Government has the country at its back . Give us an unmistakable vote of confidence , and you will hear of no more fighting in South Africa . " Well , here we are nearly two weeks away from the general election in England , in which the Government got its big majority , and news comes of a serious British reverse almost in sight of Kimberley . Mr. Chamberlain is seen to be a false prophet . Can Mr. Root hope for better luck ? Is there not every sign in the Philippines of an aroused national sentiment which prefers death to submission ? We say nothing now of the infinite meanness of maligning an enemy whom we have been unable to subdue ; but what kind of effect at home can the Republicans look for if their predictions turn out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKinley just the same ? What excuse can they then invent to cover their shame ? They will scarcely have the impudence to say they knew all the time that the Filipinos would fight to the death , election or no election , and that now the deceived voters must pay for and ship at once to the Philippines an army of 100,000 men . Senator Frye bluntly , if very indiscreetly , told the truth in his speech on Friday night , when he said of the Filipinos : " Tractically , they were allies . " In view of this , what becomes of the vast indignation of Roosevelt and Root over the charge that there was anything like an alliance ? Practically , says Senator Frye , there was an alliance , thus leaving his colleagues to wriggle out of an obligation simply because it was not down in black and white . The Senator , who was also a Peace Commissioner , could not deny his own record . At Paris he asked Gen. Whittier if the Filipinos were of " material assistance " to our army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Still more significant was the question put at Paris by Senator Frye to Commander Bradford , with the latter 's answer : " Suppose the United States , in the progress of that war , found the leader of the present Philippine rebellion an exile from his country in Hong Kong , and sent for him and brought him to the islands in an American ship , and then furnished him 4,000 or 5,000 stands of arms , and allowed him to purchase as many more stands of arms in Hong Kong , and accepted his and in conquering Luzon , what kind of nation , in the eyes of the world , should we appear to be to surrender Aguinaldo and the insurgents to Spain ? " " We become responsible for everything he has done ; he is our ally , and we are bound to protect him " Well , in - View of what has since been done , what kind of nation does Senator Frye think we now appear to be in the eyes of the world ? Two of President McKinley 's own judicial appointees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flag . Judges Galbraith and Humphreys of the Hawaiian Supreme Court ordered the discharge of a prisoner convicted under territorial laws which , the Court held , were repugnant to the Constitution of the United States and , therefore , null and void The full opinion , as printed in the Honolulu Republican , follows that of Judge Lochren of the United States District Court in all substantial details . The prisoner was discharged on narrow technical grounds relating to indictment by a grand jury and conviction by a jury of only nine persons ; but the court went boldly to the bottom of the whole question , and its opinion , though strictly ? biter , is worth citing : " We can not assent to the doctrine that the operation of the Constitution in the Territories belonging to the United States depends upon the will or action of Congress extending it there This doctrine necessarily carries with it the admission that what one Congress can give , the same or a succeeding Congress can take away , that although Congress , by the organic act organizing the Territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States to this Territory , the next Congress might repeal that part of the organic act , and that then the people of this Territory would have none of the guarantees of life , liberty , and property provided in the Constitution , and might thereafter be governed as a province , a crown colony , or in any manner that Congress , in its wisdom , or unwisdom , might provide ; that a tariff might be levied on the products of the islands going into the States , and citizens of this Territory might be denied the rights and privileges of citizens of the United States residing in other parts of its imperial domain . " This , of course , is the decision of only an inferior United States court , and may be reversed by the Supreme Court next month ; but it is enough to set shivers running down Republican backs to have such doctrine urged by McKinley 's own judges . Monday morning 's papers published a letter from Mr. B. K. Durfee , an . Insurance Examiner of the State of Illinois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance Department of that State , giving certain facts that had come to his knowledge while examining the affairs of the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company of Maryland . The letter is dated June 12 of the present year . This is a company which gives bonds for contractors and public officers , clerks , and others holding places of trust and responsibility . It is not the only Maryland institution which has done an extensive business here in the way of giving bonds for New York city officials . The letter of Mr. Durfee says : " It seems that in locating their office in New York city it was necessary to secure the influence of Richard Croker in order to receive a fair proportion of the city business ? that is , surety on contractors ' bonds and on employees of the city . That influence had to be paid for , and it was done by paying Croker a per cent upon the net profits of the company on business done in New York city This percentage , instead of being charged up to commission account or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account and deducted therefrom " He says further that the sum of $12 , - 104.57 had been paid to Croker in the year 1900 , of which $10,000 was his commission on business done in New York in the year 1899 . It is true , as Croker says , that these practices are not now disclosed for the first time . The Mazet Committee brought out sufficient testimony to show that Croker was receiving an income from the bonding business of this Maryland company , an income that did not appear on any of the company 's books , that was not paid in bank checks , but " generally in bills , " as the agent of the company testified . It is true , also , that when Croker demanded that Platt be called to the stand to show his family connection with the other Maryland bonding company , the Mazet Committee did not see anything to be gained by so doing , but " scuttled " with great rapidity . Thereupon there was much mirth in the public prints for a few days . Mazet himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only result of the investigation , but it was a result not to be despised . Of course this Maryland driblet is a very small matter . It does not go far in accounting for the income of Richard Croker or of any other irresponsible , party boss . It is one of the sources of demoralization and public pelf that have happened to be discovered . But does it not cast a shadow over the pretensions-we are making to introduce good government into distant lands ? Are even the Kentucky Colonels aban Boning the strenuous life ? Here are-Col . Young and ex-Gov . Bradley coming out in a " card " at Louisville , not to post . each other as unspeakable villains , not to threaten to shoot each other on sight , but to say that " in order to settle the personal strife between us , each of us has withdrawn everything of a personal character that he has said concerning , the other . " We can but rub our eyes at the millennial sign . The chief wonder is that this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the votes are counted , of cam , paign epithets intended purely to fire-the heart of the voter . Nothing is more-common than to see a " traitor , " an " enemy of his country " ( strictly in the Meh1 wickian election sense ) , become , when elected , the honorable opponent whose ; talents and energy we respect , and whose friendship we proudly claim . But beforeIthe result is declared  --  and in . Kentucky ! For our part , we feel that the least anzende we can make is to withdraw everything of a , personal character which we have said of the fighting Kentucky Colonel . The Commissioner of the Illinois coal-operators ' State organization , Mr. Herman Justi , has just issued a little prospectus , in which he sets forth the chief-'aims of his commission . One of these , aims is to " render coal-mining in Illinois-more profitable and less perplexing and annoying , " by having all agreements entered into between men and their employers drawn in writing , and " couched in language so plain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being left to conjecture or memory . The last State agreement entered into , under which miners are now working , provided an elaborate scheme for adjusting disputes without suspension of work at the mine . These provisions were intended as safeguards for operators and-miners alike . The commission stands ready to propose arbitration , but only as a last resort , since it hopes that the ne , cessity of referring matters to outside tribunals may be largely avoided in the-future through the elaborate provisions in standing annual agreements for direct-negotiation regarding grievances . - Commissioner Fitchie , in his latest report to the Commissioner-General of Immigration , makes no attempt to conceal the fact that the contract-labor law is persistently violated by incoming aliens at the port of New York . He says that there is a well-organized system of circumventing the immigration laws ; that a syndicate of padrones , with headquarters in this city , has branch offices in several European capitals , and is prepared to furnish , at reasonable notice , any number of foreign laborers required . The system has been so artfully elaborated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way are utterly ignorant even of the fact that they are contract laborers ; and it is chiefly owing to this fact that it is practically impossible to detect them . From the first the weakness of the law has been the fact that conviction could be secured only by the sworn confession of the suspected immigrant ; and though , owing to a misunderstanding of the spirit of the law , such confessions have been frequently obtained , the class against whom the law is chiefly aimed have had no difficulty in slipping in . As a result of the latest device of the pa-drone syndicate , practically no deportations of the most undesirable and ignorant class of immigrants have taken place , and what few exclusions have been made have been those of the highest type of aliens arriving at this port . Defalcations of bank officers and clerks are not so uncommon as to excite great surprise , but when they rise to the magnitude of $700,000 , as in the case of the First National Bank of this city , they rather take away one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accounts and make away with that sum in a bank which constantly handles fifty million dollars than $70,000 in one which has only five- millions to look after . Still more difficult would it be to spirit away $7,000 from a small bank in a small town where the eyes of the superior officers can see everything that goes on , and where even the neighbors can discern any signs betokening that a bank clerk is living beyond his salary . Every bank defalcation , large or small , ought to teach a lesson , ought to make the next one more difficult of accomplishment , ought to contribute something to the protection of the banking business and of society , The American Bankers ' Association has for years maintained a bureau for the detection and prevention of forgery and sneak thieving By careful study of the methods , mental processes , and haunts of the rascals who " work " the banks from the outside , the bureau has largely reduced the amount of successful frauds , and has landed in. the penitentiary most of the fraternity who perpetrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bureau ' which shall apply itself to frauds hatched inside of the banks also , There has been considerable stir in England lately over the sending of orders from South Africa , for machinery and iron and steel goods for the mines and railroads , to the United States . The explanation offered by Mr. Wyndham , the Parliamentary Secretary of State for War , is the very simple one that the American mills could do the work more promptly than English ones . This is a case analogous to the building of the great Atbara bridge for the Cairo-Khartum railway a year ago . Here the question of time was of supreme importance , and a Philadelphia establishment took the job away from all the English bidders and executed it in even less time than the contract provided . In the reopening of the South African gold mines time is money in a peculiar sense . In the repair of the railways after the wear and tear of war it is scarcely less so . In both particulars the American mills have been found better equipped than those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an increasing extent , not only as regards the demand of South Africa , but of the world in general There is , perhaps , nothing in the whole range of traffic with so promising a future as the iron and steel industry of the United States , notwithstanding the temporary depression . The Peace Congress which met at Paris early in October adopted resolutions condemning Great Britain for her course in the South African war , particulailyfor having refused the preliminary offer of arbitration . What made this action more significant was ' the fact that sev. eral English delegates were present and took part in it . Indeed , they even wished to draft the resolutions in stronger terms . Referring to their attitude , Michel Breal , the distinguished French scholar , writes to the Temps to point out how strong and sound a remnant there is in. all civilized countries which , even in the stress of actual war , dares to protest against it when unjust . The country is to be congratulated , says Professor Brdal , alluding particularly to England , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is foolishness . To be in the minority is , to them , the chief of sins  --  being nothing less than to " get left . " What can be more criminal than that ? The end and aim of politics and public life being to produce a " brute majority , " what possible comfort can there be in knowing that you are right although you are in a minority ? M. Waldeck-Rousseau has taken advantage of the laying of a cornerstone in Toulouse to outline his policy for the approaching session of Parliament . His tone was not that of the Premier already beaten , which many believe him to be . He insisted that France and seen the end of the Nationalist agi tation , and that there was a general rallying to the Republic and to the Administration . He pledged his party to a policy of military expansion , and , while asserting his faith in the finding of the Rennes court-martial , promised impartial amnesty to all who had through the aff sire Dreyfus suffered legal disability . He promised as well to introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of association  --  a measure directed against religious organizations . It will be seen that there was something for everybody  --  army , intellectuels , and Socialists  --  for all France save the Clericals and the remnant of irreconcilable Royalists . Behind these brave words of the Premier , however , one can not but suspect a certain trepidation . It is one thing to propound a bold and benevolent policy before an audience of amiable Toulausans ; quite another , to convert that policy into legislation before the Chamber of Deputies . It is true that the provinces generally appear to be with the Ministry , but the Chamber of Deputies is apt take its tone from Paris , and at Paris there is no sign of the conciliation that M. Waldeck-Rousseau asserts . The threatened reopening of the Dreyfus case would put the Ministry in sore straits . Most serious of all , - the Government must soon face the old turbulent anti-Republican and personal factions that have a power out of all proportion to their moral weight or popular support . These masters of- the art of turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The diplomatic representatives of France and Mexico have just signed a treaty for the mutual protection of registered trademarks . Upon proper registration , each country agrees to give faith and credence to the trademarks and infringement laws of the other . That is , a French mark must be appreciated in Mexico according to French law , and vice versa . A significant clause forbids the act of imprinting upon any article " a false indication as to the place of its origin ( manufacture ) , whereby one of the contracting states , or a place situated in either of them , is , directly or indirectly , referred to as the country or place where the article originated . " For example , the Government monopoly in France can not make a " Mexican . " - cigar , nor a Mexican wine-grower a Burgundy .
