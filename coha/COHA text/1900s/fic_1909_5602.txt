PRESS RAHWAY , N.J. THE TRIMMING OF GOOSIE CHAPTER I " Why , Goosie , what are you doing ? " Goosie , otherwise Mr. Charles-Norton Sims , dropped his arms hastily down his sides and stood very still , caged in the narrow space between porcelain tub and gleaming towel-rack . The mirror before which he had been performing his morning calisthenics faced him uncompromisingly ; it showed him that he was blushing . The sight increased his embarrassment . For a moment panic went bounding and rebounding swiftly in painted contagion from Goosie to the mirror , from the mirror to Goosie ; the blush , at first faint on Charles-Norton 's brow , flamed , spread over his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , and then rippled down his satiny skin clear to the barrier of the swimming trunks tight about his waist . It was some time before he mustered the courage to turn his foolish face toward the door through which had sounded the cooing cry of his little wife . The door was but a few inches a-jar ; it let pass only the round little nose of the round little wife , between two wide-open blue-flowers of eyes . " What are you doing , Goosie ? " she repeated in a tone slightly amused but rich with a large tolerance ; " what are you doing , Goosie , eh ? " " Nothing , Dolly , " he answered , his straight , athletic body a bit gawky with embarrassment ; " nothing . " Then , as she peered , still doubtful , through the crack : " It 's a new exercise I have  --  a dandy . See ? " And lamely he placed both his hands beneath his armpits and waved his elbows up and down three times . " Oh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , this was not the accurate repetition of what she had seen . He had been standing before the mirror very straight , then , a-tip-toe , his chest bulging ; his arms , bent with hands beneath the shoulders , had been beating up and down with a rapidity that made of them a mere white vibration , their tattoo upon his ribs like the beating of a drum ; and suddenly , as if to some singular ecstasy , his head had gone back and out of his rounded mouth there had clarioned a clear cock-a-doo-del-doo-oo , much like that of chanticleer heralding the sun . " It 's fine  --  it 's fine for the pectoral muscles , " he went on , more firmly . " Well , " she said charitably , " jump into your bath , quick , dear . Breakfast is ready , and you 'll be late at the office again if you do n't hurry . " She closed the door softly upon him . It was seldom that she intruded thus upon the mystery of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had first fallen in love ; and like most women ( who , being practical , realize that , since it is dressed , after all , that men go through the world , it is dressed that they must be judged ) Dolly appreciated her handsome young husband best in his broad-shouldered sack-coat and well-creased trousers . Charles-Norton , still rather abashed , dropped into the cold green tub , splashed , rubbed down , dressed , and sat down to breakfast . As he ate his waffles , though , out of the blue breakfast set which Dolly 's charming , puzzle-browed economy had managed to extort from the recalcitrant family budget , his usual glowing loquacity of after-the-bath was lacking . His eyes wandered furtively about the little encumbered room ; thoughts , visibly , rolled within his head which did not find his lips . And when he bade Dolly good-by , on the fifth-story landing , she missed in his kiss the usual warm linger . CHAPTER II When Charles-Norton reached the street , a narrow side-street in which like a glacier the ice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft air , perfumed with a suspicion of spring , struck him gently in the face . He drew it in deep within his lungs , and exhaled it in a long sigh . And then he stopped abruptly , and was standing very still , listening ; listening to this sigh , to the echo of it still within his consciousness , as if testing it . He shook his head disapprovingly . " Gee , " he said ; " hope I 'm not getting discontented again ! " As if in response , another gentle gust came down the street ; he caught it as it came and drew it deep within him . His chest swelled , his eyes brightened . And then suddenly he tensed ; he rose a-tip-toe , heels close together , his head went back ; his hands stole to his armpits , and his elbows began to wave up and down . " Good Lord ! " he ejaculated , catching himself up sharply ; " here goes that darned flapping again ! " He looked up and down the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nope , " he said . No one had seen him . " She saw me this morning , " he thought , and the red of his forehead came down to his cheeks . " It 's getting worse ; a regular habit . Let me see  --  two , three ; it began three weeks ago  --   --  " He shook his head perplexedly and resumed his way toward the Elevated station . " It may have been all right when I was a boy , " he said to himself as he swung along . " But now ! " Let me see . I was fourteen , the first time . " A picture rose before his eyes . It had happened in a far western land  --  a land that now remained in his memory as a pool of gold beneath a turquoise sky . He was lying there in the wild oats , upon his back , and above him in the sky a hawk circled free . He watched it long thus , relaxed in a sort of droning somnolence ; then suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , something like a convulsion had shot through his body , and he had found himself erect , head back and chest forward , his arms flapping  --   --  " ' T was the day before I ran away with the circus , " he soliloquized in the midst of the throng milling up the Elevated station stairs . " And later , when I had come back from the circus , I took that long bum on brake-beams . And when I had come back from that , a little later I went off in the forecastle of the ' Tropic Bird ' to Tahiti . And each time that flapping business came first . Every time I 've done something wild and foolish , I 've flapped first like this . First I 'd flap , then I 'd feel like doing something , I would n't know what , then I 'd do it  --  and it would be something foolish  --   --  " The train slid up to the platform ; he boarded it and by some miracle found on the bench behind the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed himself . " I 'll have to stop it , " he said decisively . He drew from his breast pocket a note-book and a pencil . Opening the book out across his knees , he bent over it and began to draw . He worked with concentration , but seemingly with little result , for he drew only detached lines . There were spirals , circles , ovals , parabolas ; lines that curved upward , broke , and curved again downward , like gothic arches ; lines that curved in gentle languor ; lines that breathed like the undulations of a peaceful sea ; and then just zipping , swift , straight lines that shot up to the upper end of the paper and seemed to continue invisibly toward an altitudinous nowhere . This is all he drew , and yet as he worked there was in his face the set of stubborn purpose , and in his eyes the glow of aspiration . He tried to make each line beautiful and firm and swift and pure . When he succeeded , he felt within him the bubbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissatisfaction , renewed yearning  --  and he would begin again . " By Jove ! " he muttered in sudden consternation , straightening away from the book . And then , " They began at the same time . " And a moment later , " And they are the same . " It had struck him abruptly that the strange urge which made him draw lines was like that which at times convulsed his body into that mysterious manifestation which , for the want of a better word , he called his " flapping . " The two things had begun together , and they were of the same essence . The impulse which possessed him as he tried for beauty with paper and pencil was the same which swelled his lungs and his heart , which made him rise a-tip-toe and wave his arms . It came from a feeling of subtle and inexplicable dissatisfaction ; it was made of a vague and vast longing . It was the same which , when a boy , had sent him to the brake-beam , the circus , and the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book shut and put it in his pocket . " No more of this , " he said . A certain confidence , though , came gradually into his eyes . " After all , these things do not mean much now , " he thought . " I was a boy , then , and unhappy . I am a man , now , and happy . " His mind idled back over the two years since his marriage , over the warm coziness of the last two years . What a wife , this little Dolly ! What a little swaddler ! She wrapped up everything as in cotton  --  all the asperities of Life , and the asperities of Charles-Norton himself also . Gone for the two years had been the old uncertainties , the vague tumults , the blind surges . Yes , he was happy . This word happy , for the second time on his tongue , set him a-dreaming . A picture came floating before his eyes . And curiously enough , it was not of Dolly , nor of the padded little flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blue overalls and cotton shirt , lying on his back amid the wild oats of a golden land , his eyes to the sky , watching up there the free wide circle of a hawk  --   --  " Soy , Mister , wot the deuce do you think you 're doing ? " shouted a husky and protesting voice in his ear . And Charles-Norton came back precipitously to the present . By his side a pale youth was squirming indignantly . Charles-Norton 's elbow was in the youth 's ribs , and his elbow was still stirring with the last oscillation of the movement that had agitated it . " Soy , " cried the youth in disgust ; " d'yous think you 's a chicken ? " " I beg your pardon , " said Charles-Norton , in an agony of humility ; " I beg your pardon . " But the youth refused to be mollified . Though he said nothing more , he kept upon Charles-Norton the snarl of his pale face and at regular intervals rubbed his ribs as though they pained him exceedingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his glass cage , he muddled his columns several times . He was far from an admirable accountant at his best ; but this day he was what he termed " the limit . " Totals fled him like birds , with a whir of wings . A sun-gleam hypnotized him once , for he did not know how long ; and his nose , a little later , followed for several gymnastic minutes the flutter of a white moth . At lunch , in Konrad 's Bakery , he found himself seated , by a singular chance , next to the very same youth whose ribs he had crushed on the Elevated a few hours before . The young man was in more amiable mood . He grinned . " Do n't you flap again and spill me coffee , Mr. Chicken , " he said , with delicate persiflage . " I wo n't , " said Charles-Norton . " I 'll buy you another cup if I do . " " Got a dollar ? " asked the youth , irrelevantly . His thin , pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Charles-Norton , hesitatingly . Dollars were big in his budget . " Why ? " The youth drew from a pocket a yellow cardboard . " Got a lottery ticket I want to sell , " he said easily . " Little Texas . Hundred Thousand first prize and lots of other prizes . Got to sell it to pay me lunch . Played the ponies yesterday . " Charles-Norton eyed the ticket doubtfully . Usually , he would not have considered the matter a moment . But somehow the incident of the morning had placed him at a disadvantage toward the pale youth . Vaguely he was moved by a wish to regain by some act the respect of this exacting person . He bought the ticket . " Maybe this was the foolish act that all this flapping announced , " he said to himself , once outside , in answer to a not uncertain prick of his marital conscience . " Buying this ticket is like buying a lightning-rod ; it may draw off the lightning ! " But his singular malady , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact ; it passed the borders of the spiritual and assumed physical symptoms . " Dolly , " he said , when he was again within the warmth of the little flat in the evening ; " Dolly , would you mind looking at my shoulders after a while ? " " Why , of course , I 'll look at them , Goosie , " answered Dolly , immediately alert at the possibility of doing something for the big man ; " what is the matter with your shoulders , Goosie ? " " I do n't know , " he said , sinking a bit wearily into the Morris chair . " They pain ; just like rheumatism or growing pain . And they tickle too , Dolly ; they tickle all the time . " He crossed his arms , raising a hand to each shoulder , and rubbed them with a shiver of delight . " It 's a nuisance , " he said . " Well , we 'll see about it right away , " said Dolly . " Right after supper . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught cold . Come on , dear , " she said , brightening ; " I 've the dandiest , deliciousest soup , right out of the Ladies ' Home Journal , for you ! " CHAPTER III " Why , Goosie ; I tell you the lumps are growing . They 're great big now , Goosie . Oh , why do n't you let me take you to the doctor ! I know something is the matter ! " Dolly had tears in her eyes almost , and her voice was very dolorous . For the fourteenth time in two weeks , she was treating the singular shoulders of Charles-Norton . He was sitting beneath the glow of the evening lamp , his coat off , his shirt pulled down to his elbows ; and she , standing behind the chair , was leaning solicitously over him . A wisp of her hair caressed his right ear , but somehow did not relax his temper . " Well , let them alone , Dolly , " he growled ; " let them alone . Good Lord , let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more peevish . To be sure , for two weeks , daily , his shoulders had been washed and rubbed and massaged and lotioned and parboiled and anointed and fomented and capsicon-plastered , till his very soul was sensitive and a suspicion was agrowl within him  --  a bad , mean feeling that Dolly was finding a bit , just a bit , of something akin to pleasure in the ardor of her ministrations . Besides , he was fighting a moral fight of his own . Great bursts of dissatisfaction swept through him every day now ; and it was only by a constant vigilance that he kept his vagrant elbows close to his ribs . " Let them be for a while , Dolly , " he repeated in gentler tone . " Besides  --  besides  --   --  " But he left unsaid the thought following the " besides . " " Now , dear , " said Dolly , kindly , but with a certain firmness ; " you 've simply got to let me see what I can do . Why , Goosie , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting humps on your back ! No  --  no ; we 'll try a nice little ice-pack to-night . " " I do n't want any ice-packs ! " yelped Charles-Norton ( what a bad-mannered young man he had become ! ) ; " I 'm tired of fomentations and things ! Besides "  --  and this time the besides did not pause , but burst out of him like a stream from a high-pressure hydrant  --  " besides , it is n't what I want  --   --  " And to an irresistible impulse his right hand reached out for a brush and , crossing over to his left shoulder , began rubbing it vigorously . " Goosie , Goosie , my clothes-brush , my best clothes-brush ! " But the lament in Dolly 's voice had little effect upon Charles-Norton . He was brushing himself with grave concentration . " Get the flesh-brush , " he mumbled between set teeth , rubbing the while ; " Gee , this feels good . Get the pack to-night . " Dolly ran into the bath-room and returned with the flesh-brush ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's something like it , " he murmured . " But , Goosie , " began Dolly . Her voice was low now ; she stood withdrawn from him as if a bit afraid ; her hands were clasped and her lips trembled . " Goosie , dear ; do n't do that . Oh , do n't ; you 'll hurt yourself . It 's getting all red , Goosie . You 're rubbing the skin off , I tell you . Why , it 's almost bleeding  --  Goosie , Goosie , stop it , stop it ! " " Feels lots better , " he said unfeelingly . " Look at it . " And transferring the brush to his left hand , he began to rub the right shoulder , raising his left for Dolly 's inspection . She approached timidly . " You 've rubbed all the poor skin off , " she announced . " It 's bleeding . " He felt the light touch of her fingers . " Why , Goosie  --  there 's something  --  something . Why , Goosie ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence that followed had an awe-stricken pulse . " What is it ? " he asked , still busily brushing . " Why , there 's something "  --  again he felt the tender touch of her fingers  --  " there 're a lot of little things  --  a lot of little things pricking right through the skin ! " " Let me rub it some more , " he said , transferring the brush . " Now , look at it , " he said , after several more vigorous minutes of his strange treatment . " Goosie ! " This time it was a cry to stab the heart . He dropped the brush and looked up at her . She was pale , and her eyes were very big . " Well , what is the matter now , " he asked impatiently . She came near again , still pale , but with lips tight . " A-ouch ! " he yelped . For with a sudden sharp movement , she had plucked something out of his shoulder . A smart came into his eyes ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the roots . " Look at this , Goosie , " she said with forced calmness , and placed something in his hand . It was very small and very soft . He dropped his eyes upon it as it lay lightly in his palm . " Good lord ! " he ejaculated , his bad humor gone suddenly into a genuine concern ; " Good Lord ! " he said , rising to his feet in consternation ; " it 's a ; it 's a  --   --  " " It 's a feather , " said Dolly , with sepulchral finality ; " it 's a feather . " It was a feather  --  a soft , downy , white , baby feather . Charles-Norton looked at it long , as it lay , shivering slightly , there in his palm . He took it up and passed the luster of it slowly through his fingers . Something like a smile gradually came into his face . He raised the feather against the light of the lamp . His eyes brightened . " Is n't it pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pretty ? just look at it . So white , and fresh , and new , and glistening . And see the curve , the slender curve of it  --  oh , Dolly , is n't it pretty and fine ? " But Dolly , collapsed in a chair , broke out a-crying . " Oh , Goosie , Goosie , what are we going to do now ? " she wailed ; " what are we to do ? O  --  O  --   --  " " Well , " said Charles-Norton , the spirit of contradiction which for several days had been within him rising to his lips ; " well , I do n't see what there is to make so much fuss about . A few feathers are not going to hurt a man , are they ? ' Tis n't as if I were insane , or had hydrophobia ! " " But , Goosie , Goosie , no one has feathers on his shoulders ! No one ever had feathers on his shoulders ! No other man in the world ever did that ; none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ! Oh , Goosie , Goosie , what shall we do ! ! ! " " Let them alone , " said Charles-Norton , now quite vexed . " They 're mine ; they do n't hurt you , do they ? Let ' em alone ! " He raised his arms and began to slip his shirt up again . The tears ceased to drip from Dolly 's eyes . " You ca n't do that , " she said , a maternal firmness coming into her voice . " Why , Goosie , what would they think of you down at the office ? " " At the office ? Why , they wo n't know it ! " " But you 'll know it , Goosie . All the time , you 'll know it . Goosie , you do n't want to be different , do you ? You want to be like other men , do n't you ? You do n't want to be different ? " This argument had some effect on Charles-Norton . He stood very still , scratching his head pensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you 're right . Maybe we had better keep them cut short . " " Oh , Goosie ! " cried Dolly , joyously , and bounded from the room . She came running back with the scissors . " Come , quick ! " she panted . " I 'll cut them , short . ' Two n't be much trouble after all , will it ? I 'll cut them every day . It will be just like shaving  --  no more trouble than that ! " And she slid the scissors along Charles-Norton 's skin with a cold , decisive little zip . He could see her head , cocked a bit side-ways with concentration , reflected in the glass panes of the side-board as she cut and cut , closer and closer . Her rosy nostrils were distended slightly ; upon her tight lip the tip of a small white tooth gleamed . A light shiver passed along Charles-Norton 's spine . " Gee , I did n't think she could look like this , " he thought . CHAPTER IV Following this little disturbance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resolutely regained the smooth rut of their placid existence . Everything in this world is easier than is imagined . Much easier . In the case of the Sims ' household , it was just a matter of adding each morning , to the daily shave of Charles-Norton , another operation quite as facile . " Dolly , " he would call , as soon as his hot towel had removed from his ruddy cheeks the last bubbles of lather . And Dolly , her hungry little scissors agleam in her hand , trotted in alacriously . She sat Charles-Norton on the edge of the tub and bent over him her happy , humming head . Zip-zip-zip , went the scissors , zip-zip  --  and a soft white fluff that looked like the stuffing of a pillow ( an A-one pillow ; not the kind upon which Charles-Norton and Dolly laid their modest heads ) eddied slowly to Charles-Norton 's feet while he shivered slightly to the coldness of the steel . ( Dolly cut very close . ) Then , " All right ; all done , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her crackling apron ; " now to breakfast , quick ! And here 's a kiss for the good boy . " Placing her red lips upon his , she whisked off to the kitchenette ; and Charles-Norton , emerging all dressed a little later , found the cheerful blue ware on the table , and his waffles upon his plate , hot beneath his napkin . After which , stuffing the morning paper into his pocket , he departed with another kiss on the landing , and strode forth for the L. Life was just as before . And yet , not quite . Because , to tell the truth , Charles-Norton was not absolutely happy . He could not have told what was the matter . Mostly , it was an emptiness . An emptiness is hard to analyze . He knew that there was much of which he should be content . With the careful repression of the vagaries of his shoulders , there had come to him a new attentiveness at his work . His nose , now , never wandered after passing butterflies , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , the ridiculous flapping had gone , and the impulse to draw fool lines upon a card . But with these  --  and that was the trouble  --  other things had vanished . That deep filling of his lungs with spring , for instance . And the longing that went with it . That was it  --  the longing . He longed for the longing  --  if that is comprehensible . He longed vaguely for a longing that had been his , and which was gone . He never saw , now , a land that was as a golden pool beneath a turquoise dome ; nor a boy in the wild oats watching a circling hawk . And there was something else , something more definite . He felt that Dolly  --  yes , Dolly took too much pleasure , altogether too much pleasure in that clipping business . Of course , the clipping had to be . He knew that . A respectable man ca n't have feathers on his shoulders . It was necessary . But somehow he would have felt that necessity more , if Dolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to voice it himself . If Dolly , now , only would , some fine morning , say , " Oh , Goosie , let them be to-day ; they are so pretty , " then he could have answered , very firmly , " No , clip away ! " But she never gave him that chance . She was always so radiantly ready ! As he watched her head in the mirror , bent upon the busy scissors with an expression of tight determination , a distinct irritation seized him sometimes . Charles-Norton , in short , was accumulating , drop by drop , a masculine grouch . A grouch deeper than he realized , till that morning . That morning Dolly , in the midst of the daily operation , paused with scissors in air , a sudden inspiration upon her brow . " Oh , Goosie , " she exclaimed ; " How would it be to cauterize them ? " Charles-Norton gave a jump . " Cauterize ! " he cried ; " cauterize what ? " " Why , the little feathers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrate of silver , or something like that . They do it to people who have moles  --  or when they have been bitten by a mad dog . Maybe  --  maybe it would stop it  --  altogether . " Charles-Norton looked up at her . Her cheeks were rosy , her eyes were bright ; she was excited and pleased with her ingenious idea . A cold wave rose about Charles-Norton and closed over his head . " Say , ' " he bawled ungraciously ; " what do you take me for ! Think I 'm made of asbestos ? " Discreet Dolly immediately dropped the subject ; though somehow Charles-Norton had the distinct impression that it was only discreetly that she did so , that , in fact , she was not dropping the idea , but merely tucking it away somewhere within the secret hiding-places of her being , for further use . He could still see it , in fact , graven there upon the whiteness of her voluntary little forehead . He brooded black over it all day . He brooded on other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that had not mattered one whit then , but which now , beneath his fostering care , began to grow into big , flapping boog-a-boos . And when he returned that night , he was a very mean Charles-Norton . He spoke hardly a word at dinner , pretended he did not like the vanilla custard over which Dolly had toiled all day , her soul aglow with creative delight , sipped but half of his demi-tasse ( as though the coffee were bitter , which it was n't ) , and went off to bed early with a good-night so frigid that Dolly 's little nose tingled for several minutes afterward . And the next morning , when Dolly , astonished at the delay , finally peeped into the bath-room , scissors in hand , she found Charles-Norton fully dressed , his coat on . " Why , Goosie , " she said in surprise ; " I have n't clipped you yet ! " " No ? " he growled enigmatically . " Take off your coat , dearie , " she went on . " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his statement with complete disregard of hers . Dolly stood there a moment , looking at him with head slightly cocked to one side . " All right , Goosie , " she said cheerily . " Only , do n't get mad at poor little me . Come on to breakfast , you big , shaggy bear , you ! " " I do n't want any breakfast , " growled Charles-Norton between closed teeth ( as a matter of fact , he did , and a fragrance of waffles from the kitchen was at the moment profoundly agitating the pit of his being ) . " I do n't want any breakfast  --  where 's my hat  --  quick , I 'm in a hurry  --  good-by . " And tossing the hat bellicosely upon his head , he pulled to himself the hall door , swaggered through , and let it slam back on his departing heels , right before the astonished nose of his little wife . She remained there before this rude door , examining its blank surface with a sort of objective curiosity . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps gradually diminishing down the five flights . She shook her head ; " the bad , bad boy ! " she said . She pivoted with a shrug of the shoulders and went back to the kitchen and sat down at the table , all set for breakfast . She took up her fork and cut off a bit of waffle . She placed it in her mouth . Her eyes went off far away . It took it a long time , this little piece of waffle , to go down . Lordie , what a tough , resilient , flannelly , bit of waffle this was ! Suddenly her head went forward . It lit upon the table , in her hands . A cup of the precious blue ware , dislodged , balanced itself a moment on the edge of the table , then , as if giving up hope , let go and crashed to the floor at her feet in many pieces . She gave it no heed . Her head was in her hands , her hands were on the table , her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the table trembled . CHAPTER V Meanwhile Charles-Norton was not having such a good time either . Starting off swaggeringly , he had halted three times on his way to the station , and three times had taken at least two steps back toward the flat which he felt desolate behind him . And now in his glass cage , a weight was at his stomach , a constant weight like an indigestible plum-pudding . At regular intervals , as he bent over his books , he felt his heart descend swiftly to the soles of his feet ; he paled at the sight of a telegraph messenger , at the sound of the telephone bell . He had visions of hospitals  --  of a white cot to which he was brought , a white cot about which grave men stood hopelessly , and on the pillow of which spread a cascade of golden hair . Too imaginative , this Charles-Norton , too imaginative altogether ! He did not know that after a while Dolly had risen , and a bit wearily , with heavy sighs , had washed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat in order ; that during this operation , in spite of her best efforts , she had felt her woe slowly oozing from her ; that the provisioning tour in the street and stores gay with gossipy , bargaining young matrons , had almost completed this process ; and that a providential peep in a milliner 's window , which had suddenly solved for her the harassing problem of the spring hat ( she had seen one she liked and with a flash of inspiration had seen how she could make one just like it out of her old straw and some feathers long at the bottom of her trunk ) had sent her bounding back up her five flights of stairs with a song purring in her heart . So that when , returning in the evening , Charles-Norton opened the door with bated breath , to find Dolly humming happily in the kitchen , he was struck by something like disappointment . " She 's shallow , " he thought ; " does n't feel . " He did not mean by this , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He meant merely  --  well , he did not know what he meant . He was disillusioned , that was all . This was but a prosy world after all . Few Heroics here ! And immediately a warning knocked at his consciousness . He must be careful if he were to hold what advantage he had gained in the day . He turned from the kitchen threshold and silently slunk back into the room which was both dining and sitting-room , and isolated himself behind the spread pages of the evening paper . He was curt and cold the entire evening . And in the morning he again left with calculated violence  --  breakfastless and unsheared . This time , Dolly did not weep . She sat long on the edge of her bed , thinking silently ; then a silver rocket of sound broke the sepulchral quiet of the flat . Dolly had had a vision of what must inevitably happen ; and Dolly was laughing . It took just ten days to happen  --  ten days which were rather disagreeable , of course , but which Dolly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with jolly fortitude . All that time , Charles-Norton glowered constantly . He was monosyllabic and ostentatiously unhappy . This more than was necessary , and very deliberate . It had to be deliberate ; for , as a matter of fact , on the outside Charles was not having at all a bad time . The exaltation of the ante-clipping days had returned  --  returned heightened , and was still growing day by day . A constant joyous babbling , as of some inexhaustible spring , lay at the bottom of his soul . His senses were singularly acute . He thrilled to a leaf , to a bud , to a patch of blue sky ; and the thrill remained long , a profound satisfaction within him , after the stimulant had gone . With the resolution of a roue plunging back into his vice after an enforced vacation , he had brought a large sketch book ; and he passed much time drawing lines into it  --  rapid beauty streaks that gave him a sensation of birds . He saw often , now , a land which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a boy in the wild oats watching a circling hawk . At such times his lungs filled deep with the spring , and his arms were apt to beat at his sides in rapid tattoo . This , in fact made up solely his morning exercises now . Standing with legs close together , a-tip-toe , head back and chest forward , placing his hands beneath his shoulders he waved his arms up and down in a beat that rose in fervid crescendo , till his eyes closed and there went through him a soaring ecstasy that threatened at times to lift him from the floor . All this , of course , was not without its disadvantage . Vaguely he felt that in some subtle way he was gaining the disapproval of his fellows . Men were apt to look at him askance , half doubtful , half-indignant . They tread on his toes in the Elevated . His work , too , was going to pot ; he could not stick to his figures . His chief , an old fragile-necked book-keeper , had spoken to him once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a preliminary little cough ; " Mr. Sims , you ought to take care of your health . You are not well . " " Oh , yes I am , " answered Charles-Norton , absent-mindedly . His eyes were on the ceiling , where a fly was buzzing . " I 'm all right ! " " You should  --  er  --  you should consult  --  a specialist , Mr. Sims . Do n't you know  --  your shoulders , your back  --  you should consult a spine-specialist , Mr. Sims . " " Oh , that 's all right , " said Charles-Norton , easily . " Do n't worry . " And thus he had sent back the old gentleman baffled to his high stool . And then came Dolly 's day . " Dolly ! Dolly ! Dolly ! " It was morning , before breakfast . Charles-Norton was in the bedroom ; Dolly was setting the table in the living-room . She paused , and stood very still , while a little knowing smile parted her lips . " Dolly ! Dolly ! Dolly ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolly 's ear . She tip-toed to the door . From within sounded a threshing noise , as of a whale caught in shallows . " Yes . What is it ? " she called back melodiously , mastering her desire to rush in . " Come here , Dolly , " said the male voice . " Come here . " " I 'm coming , " said Dolly , and went in with a slightly bored expression . " Help me , Dolly , " said the perspiring and be-ruffled gentleman within . " I ca n't  --  ca n't  --  get my coat on . " " Why , Goosie ; of course I 'll help you . " But the help , although almost sincere , was powerless . The coat would not go on . The sleeves rose to the elbows smoothly , half way to the shoulders with more effort  --  but here they stuck , refusing to slide over the top of the shoulders . On each side of the spine , almost cracking the shirt , a protuberance bulged which the coat could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mussed up , his eyes wrathful . " Well , " he growled at length ; " why do n't you go get your scissors . " " Shall I ? " she said doubtfully  --  and at the same time bounced out like a little rabbit . " Take off your shirt , Goosie , " she said , returning with the gleaming instruments , now symbolical of her superior common-sense . She aided him . She took off his collar and tie , unfastened the buttons , and then she was tugging at the shirt . It slid down , uncovering the shoulders . There was a dry , crackling sound , as of a fan stretched open  --  and Dolly sat down on the floor . " Oh-oh-oh , " she cried , " Go-oo-oo-ssie-ie ! " He stood there , looking out of the corner of his eye at his reflection in the mirror , red-faced and very much abashed . For with the slipping of the shirt , on his shoulders there had sprung , with the movement of a released jack-in-the-box , two vibrant white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were  --   --  " They 're wings , " said Dolly , still on the floor . " They are wings , " she repeated , in the tone of one saying , He is dead . " Now , Goosie , you have done it ! " But a change had come in Charles-Norton . The blush had left his brow , the foolish expression his face ; he was pivoting before the mirror like a woman with a new bonnet . " I like them , " he said . And then , " Just look at them , Dolly . Just look at the curve of them . Is n't it a beautiful curve ! And the whiteness of them , Dolly  --  like a baby 's soul . And how downy  --  soft like you , Dolly . Look at them gleam . And they move , Dolly , they move ! Dolly , oh , look ! " The wings were gently breathing ; their slender tips struck his waist at each oscillation . The movement quickened , became a beat , a rapid palpitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bed , dislodged , eddied to the floor ; the wings were a mere white blur . Suddenly Charles-Norton 's feet left the floor , and he rose slowly into the air . " Look , look , Dolly , " he cried , as he went up , hovering above her up-tilted nose and her wide eyes , as she sat there , paralyzed , upon the ground ; " Dolly , look ! " The humming sound took a higher note ; a picture crashed down ; the room was a small cyclone . " Dolly , watch me ; look ! " And with a sudden leap , Charles-Norton slanted up toward the ceiling and lit , seated , on the edge of the shelf that went along the four walls . " Look , " he said with triumph , balancing smilingly on his perch . But immediately his expression changed to one of concern , and he sprang down quickly and quietly . Dolly was now stretched full-length along the carpet ; her face was in her arms . He turned it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHAPTER VI A husband who has a wife that faints is in the grasp of the great It . Full of fear , pity , remorse , and self-hatred , Charles-Norton danced about helplessly for several minutes , sprinkling water upon Dolly 's brow ( much of it went down her neck ) ; trying to pour bad whiskey between her pearly teeth ; calling himself names ; chafing her hands , promising to be good , to do always what she wanted ; loosening her garments ; proclaiming the fact that he was a brute , she an angel  --  while the wings , loose down his back , flapped after him in long , mournful gestures . And when finally , from the couch upon which he had drawn her , Dolly opened upon him her blue eyes , humid as twin stars at dawn , he placed her little scissors in her hand , and with head bowed low , in an ecstatic agony of self-renunciation bade her do her duty . The little scissors could not do it this time , though . It took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , murmurings , embraces , and Dolly said that the bad , bad times were all over now , and he agreed that they could never come again ; and she said they would be happy ever afterward , and he agreed they should be happy always . Then Dolly , still a bit languid , in a voice still a bit doleful , drove him off to the office . Where he arrived very late , and had to pass the gauntlet of his chiefs frigid ignoring of the dereliction . When Charles-Norton had gone , Dolly suddenly sat up with a click of small heels upon the floor . She remained thus some time , a frown between her eyes . She was not triumphant , she was worried . She seemed to recognize danger ; her transparent nostrils dilated to the smell of powder ; and plainly , you could see her steel her being . After a while she nodded to herself , curtly and very decidedly , and went on about her work . She met Charles-Norton at the door when he returned in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culpas ! and she , a quarter of an hour before the time for his reappearance , had powdered her nose  --  which , she knew , gave her an expression half amusing , half piteous , just like that of the clown who is playing his tricks at the circus while his little daughter is dying at home . " Hello , Goosie , " she said breathlessly ( also she had rubbed a trace of rouge under her eyes ) ; " hello , just in time for dinner ! Made a fine chocolate cake . Poor dear , you look so tired ! " And after supper , which in spite of Dolly 's very ostensible effort at exuberance , was rather silent , for Charles-Norton , with a man 's detestation of " scenes , " still felt somewhat embarrassed at the happenings of the morning , she drew up the Morris chair to the lamp , sat Charles-Norton in it , and filled his pipe for him . When thus " fixed up comfy , " he felt a soft breath upon his neck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collar , and then the coat , and then the shirt , and then  --  zip-zip . " Say , Dolly , " he remonstrated mildly ; " could n't you wait till morning ? " " There , " she said ; " it 's almost all done . Just a wee bit more here . There ! Now here is a kiss ! It did n't hurt , Goosie , did it ? " And Charles-Norton had to concede that it did not hurt . How could he have explained the subtle feeling within him , that sort of swooping descent of his inwards that came with , and the dullness of all things which followed always his shearings ? " No , it did n't hurt , " he repeated . But a vague dissatisfaction like a yeast stirred within him , and a flicker ,  --  beaten down immediately , it is true , trampled , smothered ,  --  of revolt . Calmly , coolly , efficiently , though , Dolly had taken the upper hand . The next morning she sent him sheared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . And thus day after day for many days . Every morning Charles-Norton went out to his work full of emptiness ( if that phrase is permissible ) , empty of heart , empty of mind , without a desire , without an anger . The warm June days had come ; he had changed his underwear . He felt the season only as a discomfort . The emerald explosions visible at the end of each street as the L train passed along Central Park did not stir him ; the tepid airs drifting lazily from the sea , the fragrant whiffs from the depths of the germinating land , passed over him as though he were made of asbestos . An insulation was about him , removing him from all things that thrill , all things that distend ; there was no color , no vibration in the world ; iridescences had ceased ; the chamber of his soul had been painted a dull drab . He had regained , though , the esteem of his fellows . The subtle and unerring instinct which had made them suspicious in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same inexplicable way told them that he was normal again . They looked at him no longer askance . In fact , they did not look at him at all . They accepted him without question in crush of street and L ; gave him his rightful space ( nine and a half inches in diameter ) ; trod on his feet only when forced to ( by the impulse to obtain a more comfortable position ) ; poked their elbows into his stomach only when necessary ( that is , when they had to get out or in ahead of him ) ; and on the whole surrounded him with that indifference which at the bottom is a sort of regard , which means that one conforms , that one 's derby , sack-suits , socks and shoes , habits , ideas , morals and religion are just exactly like the derbies , sack-suits , socks and shoes , habits , ideas , morals and religion of everyone else , and hence right . At the office he had regained the appreciation of his chiefs ; his salary had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his working hours from eight to nine hours . His home life was the standard ideal one . That is , he got up at the same time every morning , left punctually at the same hour , took the L , arrived at the office on the minute , worked with his nose close to the ruled pages , steadily , without a distraction , till 12.30 , had his macaroon tart and cup of coffee at Konrad 's Bakery , smoked his five-cent cigar in the nearby square till 1.30 , worked again till 5.30 , returned home on the L , pressed tight like a lamb on the way to the packing-house , had a cozy little dinner upon which Dolly had spent all her ingenuity , smoked his pipe in the Morris chair , and then read the paper till the sudden contact of his chin with his chest and Dolly 's amused warning sent him off to bed . A very moral , regular , exemplary existence . Dolly was very happy . And then , just as this couple could see the track clear ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complication began to worm itself into the serenity of their lives . This complication arose from the fact that the suppressed wings of Charles-Norton began to grow faster . Each day , now , Charles-Norton , returning home , brought with him to Dolly a task more serious and considerable . She had long ago discarded the little scissors and used special shears made to cut heavy cardboard ; and she finished off with a safety razor . The result of this increase in the rate of winged growth was that , whereas Charles-Norton every morning left home placid and docile , his character gradually changed during the day . Starting at his work in the spirit of a blind horse at the mill , by ten o'clock he was apt to find himself , pen-holder in mouth , nose up in the air , following the evolutions of a buzzing flylet . By eleven o'clock , the cage had become very stuffy ; spasmodic intakes swelled his chest , ghost longings stirred within him . When he got out at 12.30 the sun seemed to pour right through his skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He hurried over his macaroon tart and cup of coffee , and then had three-quarters of an hour left to idle in the square . He prepared for this gravely , as for a ceremony ; first by buying a Pippin . A slender , light-brown Pippin , scientifically sprinkled with golden freckles , for five cents . ( A daily Pippin was a recognized item of the family budget ; at one time Charles Norton had carried his pipe with him , but Dolly , noticing the doubtful fragrance given by said pipe to the clothes of Charles-Norton , had insisted upon the extravagance of the daily Pippin ) . Having bought the Pippin , Charles-Norton did not light it right away . Oh , no . He ambled first to the square . He selected his bench carefully  --  one upon which the sun shone , but shone with a light filtered by the leaves of a low-branching elm . He sat down ; he stretched his legs straight before him . Then slowly , with deliberation of movement , he scratched a match . He brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send forth effluvia , an exquisite vapor , faintly-blue . Charles-Norton half closed his eyes ; his soul began to purr . Before him a fountain plashed ; about the fountain were red blossoms ; the elms rustled gently against the blue sky ; through the delicate lace of their leaves the sun eddied down like a very light pollen ; and all this , through the Pippin 's exquisite atmosphere , was enveloped and smoothed and glazed into a picture  --  a slightly hazy dream-picture . Charles-Norton stretched his legs still more ; his shoulders rose along the sides of his head . He was as at the bottom of the sea  --  a warm and quiet summer sea . Down through its golden-dusty waters , a streak of sun , polished like a rapier , diagonaled , striking him on the breast ; and to its vivifying burn he felt within him his heart expand , as though it would bloom , like the red flowers about the fountain . Upon the other benches sprawled some of the city 's derelicts . The sun was upon them also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and groans , their warped bodies , petrified with the winter 's long cold , distending slowly in pain . Pale children in their buggies slept with mouths open , gasping like little fish ; some played upon the asphalt . Charles-Norton , by this time , was apt to be far away ; far in another land . He lay upon his back and watched a hawk on high . The sparrows usually brought him back . They played about his feet ; they chirped , hopped , and tattled ; they peered side-ways at him and gave him jerky nods of greeting . At times one of them , to a sudden inspiration , sprang into the air ; with a whir he flashed up to the top of a tree . To the movement , something within Charles-Norton leaped to his throat . Across the park , gaunt behind the trees , rose the tall steel frame of a new building ; and away up at the top of it ( which was higher every day ) a workingman , on a girder , ate his lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran from him to the little figure silhouetted up against the blue . He should have liked to eat his lunch up there , side by side with this man , his legs swinging next to his , with the void beneath . And then , he thought , after lunching , he would like to stand erect , away up there , at the tip edge of one of the projecting beams ; to stand there a bit , and then spring off ; spring off lightly , and whiz down ; down , down , down with outspread arms . Which was a very foolish thought for a man that worked in a cage to dream . Very foolish , even if the cage were of glass . Just about that time the Pippin went out in a black smolder , and from a nearby church , hidden between great sky-scrapers , a big ding-dong bell said resonantly that it was half-past one . He returned to the office . Every afternoon , now , was a tingling trial . He worked with head down , sweating with repression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his glass cage . Out , not through the door , but through the glass . Not gently , like Alice going into Wonderland , but with ostentation and violence , with a heralding crash of shattered panes , scandalously . Out of his cage , into the next ; out of that , into the next ; from one end of the big room , in fact , to the other , crashingly , through cage after cage  --  and then out upon the street through the plate front . Half-past five finally freed him ; and taking his place in a packed herring-box on wheels , he was rolled back to Dolly  --  and the shearing . Thus for a while did the young people live securely on a clown 's tissue-paper hoop . Then one evening , just as Charles-Norton , after successfully resisting all day his anarchistic glass-smashing impulse , was watching the hands of the clock approach the minute that was to free him , his chief , raising his bald head at the end of his long , thin neck , said casually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Mr. Sims . " CHAPTER VII " We work all night to-night , Mr. Sims . " It is always with just such a sentence , quiet , drab , and seemingly insignificant , that Mr. Catastrophe introduces himself . " Yes ? " said Charles-Norton , adjusting his neck-tie and looking at the calendar . He was not surprised , for this happened twice a year . Twice a year , on a day in December and a day in June , a part of the force worked all night to prepare a statistical table for the benefit of the stockholders . He telephoned to Dolly . Her voice came to him over the wire in a scared little squeak . " Oh , Goosie , " she pleaded ; " come up before starting in again . I 'll let you go off right away . But please come up , please do ! " " Ca n't , " shouted Charles-Norton . " We 're allowed only an hour for dinner , and it would take more than that just to go up and back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little late , " suggested Dolly . " No , ca n't come up , " said Charles-Norton , astonished at his own firmness ( it is much easier to be firm over a telephone , anyway ) . " There 's too much to do . I 'll be up in the morning , maybe . " " But Goo-oo-sie  --   --  " " Nope . Ca n't . Good-by , dearie , " said Charles-Norton , and hung up the receiver , and with a bad conscience and a soaring heart , went off to dinner . No shearing to-night  --  gee ! He ordered a dinner which made the red-headed waitress gasp . " Must have got a raise , eh ? " she diagnosed . " No , not a raise , not a raise , " hummed Charles-Norton ; " skip now ; I 'm hungry . " The night was a long and toilsome one , but an inexhaustible bubble was at the pit of Charles-Norton 's being ; gradually through the night he felt , beneath his coat , his shoulders deliciously swelling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk , a cry left his lips . It had showered during the night , and to the rising sun the whole city was glowing as with a golden dew . The air was fresh ; Charles-Norton gulped it down . He felt as though a broad river were streaming through him  --  a clear , cool river . Suddenly , his heels snapped together , his head went back ; his hands rose to his armpits and his arms began to vibrate up and down . A policeman came running across the street . " Say , wot de ' ell are you doing ? " he bellowed , red-faced and outraged . " I 'm going to breakfast , " answered Charles-Norton , cockily . He went into the bakery , his hat a-tilt , with the air of a conqueror . For he had decided not to go up to the flat , but to breakfast right here and to spend an hour in the square before going back to the glass cage at nine . His chest pouted ; his eyes glistened ; wine ran in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He was eating fast , in a hurry for the Pippin and the loll on the bench , when he felt someone sit down by him . There was a pause ; then , " hello , chicken ! " piped a thin voice in his ear . " Hello , Pinny , " answered Charles-Norton , even before looking . He had recognized the voice of the pale youth whom he had elbowed on the L a few weeks before , and whom later he had placated here in the bakery . " S'pose you 're a millionaire by this time , chicken , " said the youth , jocularly . " Sure , Pinny , " answered Charles-Norton . " But really , honest , did yuh win anything ? " went on Pinny , more seriously . " Win ? " Suddenly Charles-Norton remembered the lottery ticket that he had bought . He had forgotten it completely . " The drawings was three days ago , " Pinny was saying ; " got ' em here , " and out of his pocket he drew a soiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much contortion ; and it was some time before his hand flashed out triumphantly with a piece of dog-eared , yellow cardboard . " Wot 's your number ? " asked Pinny . " Nineteen thousand , eight hundred and ninety-seven , " Charles-Norton read . Pinny was perusing the clipping in his hand . " Wot did you say , " he piped suddenly ; " wot 's the number ? " " Nineteen thousand , eight hundred and ninety-seven , " repeated Charles-Norton . The pale youth seemed to collapse . His chin went forward on his green tie , his back slid down the back of his chair , his hands dropped limp upon the table . " Well , I 'll be eternally dod-gum-good-blasted , " he said weakly . " You 've done it , " he continued , solemnly ; " you 've gone and done it . " He looked at his clipping again . " Lemme see your ticket , " he said . He placed the ticket and the clipping side by side ; his stubby , black-fringed finger slid from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , " he repeated , with the same funereal intoning . " Nineteen thousand , eight hundred and ninety-seven ! And I 've held that ticket in my hands , right in these hands ! Eight hundred dollars .  --  Nineteen thousand , eight hundred and ninety-seven wins eight hundred dollars "  --  his tongue lingered , as if it tasted it , upon each opulent number  --  " Eight hundred dollars ; that 's what you win . And all owing to me , too . " Charles-Norton had forgotten his ham-and-eggs . He took the ticket and the clipping from Pinny 's nerveless fingers and compared them . 19897 ! That was right . He had won eight hundred dollars . " Where do you cash in ? " he exclaimed with a sudden ferocity . " I 'll take you to it , " murmured Pinny , still in a daze . " Gee  --  and I had that ticket in this here pair of hands . I 'll take yuh to it . It 's down town . No trouble getting the money . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't yuh ? " His sharp face was almost beneath Charles-Norton 's chin ; his pale eyes rolled upward wistfully . A sudden gust of pity went through Charles-Norton . " Surely , " he said . " Better than that ; we 'll share . " He paused , coughed . A wave of prudence was modifying his impulse  --  the prudence that inevitably comes with wealth . " I 'll give you  --  I 'll give you twenty-five dollars ! " he announced . " Come on ! " said Pinny ; " come on  --  we 're losing time , eating in this joint . Say , you 'll have all you want to eat now , wo n't yuh  --  oysters and wine and grape-fruit and everything . And girls , eh ? Autos and wine and girls  --  Gee ! " And his eyes remained fixed on the vision of splendor , of the splendor of Charles-Norton , missed so narrowly by himself . Together they went down to the offices of the Little Texas , where after having been warmly congratulated by an oily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of documents and testimonials , Charles-Norton was given a long yellow check , which was forthwith photographed , as was also Charles-Norton . Then the fat , oily man , the clerk who had prepared the documents , Pinny , and Charles-Norton went downstairs and , standing up against a polished walnut counter , drank to the long life of the Little Texas and to the success of Charles-Norton . After which the courteous oily man introduced Charles-Norton to the cashier of a bank , where Charles-Norton deposited his check , receiving in return a little yellow deposit-book , and a long green check-book . With Pinny , Charles-Norton rode back toward the office . They stopped at the square , and stood a while watching the fountain , each a bit uncertain . Finally Pinny put out his hand . " Well , so long , old man , " he said ; " so long . " " So long , " said Charles-Norton , indecisively . But Pinny still stood there , abashed and uncertain . " You was going to  --  but you 've changed yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer mind  --  You was going to  --   --  " His eyes were on the ground ; he shuffled one foot gently . " You was going to  --   --  " " Oh , of course ! " cried Charles-Norton . " I was going to give you a share of the swag  --  of course , of course , of course ! " They sat on a bench . Charles-Norton took out of his pocket the long check-book and opened it out , with a little crackling sound , on its first clean page . He took out his fountain pen . " No. 1 , " he wrote down with great decision . He paused , looking about him for a moment , in enjoyment of this new occupation . " June 19 , " he wrote on , slowly , languorously . " Pay to the order of , " the page said next . " Of Frank Theodore Pinny , " wrote Charles-Norton . " Dollars , " the check said next , at the end of a blank line . Charles-Norton paused , pen poised above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what he had promised . " T-w-e-n-t-y , " he wrote . The pen stopped again , hovering hesitatingly above the paper . " Twenty-five is a whole lot , " he thought . " Just for selling a ticket . Just for selling a piece of cardboard ! " And eight hundred dollars was not so much , either . An hour before , eight hundred dollars had seemed an immense sum . Now it seemed a modest amount , a very modest amount . And twenty-five , twenty-five to give away  --  that seemed quite big . " Pay to the order of Frank Theodore Pinny , " he re-read , " twenty  --   --  " The pen made a sudden descent . " And no-hundredths , " it wrote swiftly . Charles-Norton signed the check , tore it from the book , folded it , and presented it to Pinny , a bit patronizingly . Pinny stuck it into a side pocket without looking at it . He was standing on one leg and seemed in a hurry to get away . Charles-Norton , suddenly , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been with them for the last hour had abruptly flown with this passing of money . Each man was embarrassed , as before a stranger . " So long , " said Pinny ; " so long , " said Charles-Norton . Pinny , with averted head , turned and walked away . Charles-Norton pivoted on his heel , and started for the office , worried suddenly by the thought that he was late . He took three long steps , collided with a sodden old gentleman who was just arising from a bench  --  and then was standing very still , looking about him as in a daze , unconscious of the mutter of apology which , together with an odor of stale beer , was fermenting beneath his nose . The old gentleman , pursuing a ray of sun , slipped on to a farther bench . But Charles-Norton still stood there , gazing about him in a sort of mild astonishment , as if , while he was not looking , the scene about him had been transformed like so much cardboard scenery . To the shock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a chemical beaker the reluctant crystallization abruptly takes place , there had come to Charles-Norton the realization that he did not have to go to the office . He did not have to go to the office ! Here , against his heart , represented by three black figures within a little yellow book , was eight hundred dollars , practically eight months ' salary , the assurance of eight months almost of independence , of freedom ! " And Dolly ? " You will think , perhaps , that Charles-Norton was seized by an ardent desire immediately to run to Dolly , spring up the five flights of stairs , push open the door , catch her by the waist and , seating her on his knees , to pantingly tell her of the wondrous news ? You are mistaken . For with the vision of Dolly , the thought that irresistibly came to Charles-Norton was  --   --  That he did n't have to go to Dolly . He did n't have to go to Dolly and be clipped . He did n't have to go to the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolly . The scissors of Dolly . Charles-Norton , very pale , his long , strong legs trembling beneath him , sank upon the nearest bench , and tried to catch hold of the world again , of the reality of the world . His hands , unconsciously expressing his mental attitude , held the bench 's rim tight with white knuckles . Eight hundred dollars was not so much . Besides , it was only seven hundred and eighty now . And Dolly was a good little wife . A good , faithful , loving little wife . In a few months the money would all be gone if he stopped working . If he went back to the office and worked , the eight hundred ( minus twenty ) could be kept in the savings bank as a precious resource against ill-luck . And some of it could be used to buy things  --  furs for Dolly , for instance , brave little Dolly . Her household allowance could be increased a bit  --  brave , cheerful , careful , economical , busy , loving little Dolly ! In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great distinctness a furtive creaking within the shoulders of his coat . " Dear Little Dolly ! " he exclaimed ostentatiously , making a brave effort to keep his eyes upon his beacon . But right from between his feet a sparrow , like a firecracker exploding , sprang and went whirring up in the sky . Charles-Norton followed it with his eyes as it went winging , winging up in a series of lines , each of which ended in a droop , toward the high sky-scraper . And when his eyes reached , with the bird , the top of the building , they lit upon a cloud , a great white galleon of a cloud which , with all sails set , flanks opulently agleam with the swell of impalpable freights , went sliding by with streaming pennons , toward the West . And Charles-Norton felt as though he were going to die . A great , sad yearning seemed to split his breast . He rose to his feet , his eyes upon the cloud . A turbulence now churned within him ; his shoulders palpitated within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sheared for a full twenty-four hours ) ; a wave of madness , of daring , of revolt , rose into the head of Charles-Norton . " No , no , no , " he growled . " No more , no more , I ca n't , I ca n't , no more , no , no ! " The last no was as a trumpet note  --  a defiant negative hurled at the Force of the Universe . And Charles-Norton began to race around the fountain , striking with his right fist his left hand , muttering unintelligible and tremendous protests . You see , his wings had grown altogether too long . He could feel their ligatures reaching like roots to his soul . When , at the end of the third lap , he came to his bench again , his mind was made up . Only details remained to be determined . And when he rose for the last time from the bench , these were fixed . His appearance was one of great calmness tense above a suppressed ebullition . Before him his programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Firstly he went to the bank and drew out three hundred dollars in cash . With the roll in his breast-pocket , he walked up Broadway till he came to a Cook 's Tourist agency ; entering , after a short discussion aided by the perusal of a map , he exchanged part of his roll for a long , green , accordeon-pleated ticket . Then he went out and bought himself a tawny , creaky suit-case , and then , successively , going from store to store : Two collars . A comb . A neck-tie . A tooth-brush . A safety razor . A little can of tooth-powder . A shaving brush and a cake of soap . A cap . A pair of much abbreviated swimming trunks . All of which he placed in his new suit-case . Then after a moment of frowning consideration , he purchased two thick woolen double-blankets which he rolled up and strapped . After which he boldly strode into the Waldorf-Astoria . Such affluence , by this time , did his person emanate that four brass-buttoned boys simultaneously sprang to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved them aside with a commanding gesture and went into the writing-room . He opened his check-book. " 3 , " he wrote firmly in the right hand corner . " Pay to the order of , " he read ; " Dolly Margaret Sims , " he wrote , " Four hundred and eighty and no-hundredths dollars . " He signed the check , tore it off , and let the now looted check-book drop negligently to the floor . He placed the folded check in an envelope , wrote a little letter and placed it by the check , sealed the envelope , and wrote upon it , MRS . CHARLES NORTON SIMS 267 West 129th St. New York and rang for a messenger boy , to whom he gave the letter . Then calling for a taxi-cab , he whizzed away to the Grand Central station . Ten minutes later , amid a ding-donging of bells and a roaring of steam , a big , luxurious train began to strain at its couplings on its way overland . As it slid slowly out beneath the resonant cupola , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observation platform . And there , upon this wide , large platform , which was much like a miniature stage , Charles-Norton appeared for a moment in undignified pantomime . Leaning over the shining rail , chin thrust out , he shook both fists at the receding city , and spit into its face . CHAPTER VIII Charles-Norton 's letter came to Dolly in the evening , after a day full of worry . It read : " DEAR DOLLY :  --  Enclosed is $480 . It 's for you . I 'm going away . I simply ca n't stand it , that 's all . I think I still love you , Dolly , but I ca n't stand the life . I ca n't , that 's all . I must have , I must have  --  well , I ca n't stand that clipping business any longer . " Please do n't grieve . Some day you 'll meet a man who is real fond of you and who will make you happy  --  one that has n't any wings . There are lots of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLES-NORTON . " " P.S.  --  Please do n't feel too bad about this . " C.N. " At the reading of this tactful epistle , Dolly , of course , immediately burst out into hysterics . These shall remain undescribed here . There is something mysterious about hysteria which paralyzes the pen . Not the least mysterious thing about it is the fact that the word , pronounced in an assembly of men and women , will simultaneously call up haggard lines on the faces of the men and cooing sniggles in the throats of the ladies . Anyway , poor little Dolly had it bad all that night , and all the next day , and all the next night . By the morning of the second day , it had passed to a lamentable wandering to and fro within the cage-like apartment , with disordered garments and unkempt hair , through which eyes shone with a glint of madness . By the afternoon of the same day , it was taking some interest in its reflection as it passed the several mirrors in its ceaseless pacing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening it caught itself nibbling cracker and cheese in the upset kitchen , it realized that it needed new stimulus . It telegraphed for Dolly 's Boston aunt . The calculation proved correct . When , twelve hours later , the Boston aunt pressed the button at the landing , she found herself almost immediately tackled around the neck , while a shriek pierced her right ear . This was followed by a palpitant hugging , from the folds of which emerged vague , bubbling sounds . The aunt bore the demonstration with stoicism and with a certain reservation of self . She was very much unlike Dolly  --  tall and spare , with bushy brows , beneath the deep arcade of which glowed two limpid gray eyes . These eyes , during Dolly 's little performance , remained somehow outside of the enveloping flutter . They peered over Dolly 's shoulder in an alert examination of the disorder evident within the flat , and in their serene depths a slight will-o ' - the- wisp seemed discreetly dancing . When finally Dolly 's outburst had moderated , the old lady spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolly dropped her convulsive hold and drew back a step . " The bath-room ! " she exclaimed , her eyes very big ; " you want to know where the bath-room is ! " " Yes , the bath , " repeated Auntie , as though astonished at the astonishment . Dolly showed it to her . A calmness had come over her , a calmness of indignation . Auntie gave the bottom of the tub a hurried cleaning , adjusted the faucet to a tepid flow , dropped in the stopper , and sat down on the edge of the porcelain as the water rose within . " I 'm going to give you a bath , " she announced to Dolly , who stood there petrified with hurt amazement . And when the tub was full , she rose lightly to her feet and began to take off Dolly 's soiled kimono . Dolly , in a daze , felt the garment slip from her , and then slid into the warm , green pool , which closed softly about her neck . " You lie there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and give you a shampoo . " And Dolly remained alone in the steaming room . Little by little , to the persistent caress of the warm water , she felt her body relax ; she shut her eyes ; from beneath the closed lids tears exuded softly ; they came freely , without a pang . After a while , even these ceased . From the bedroom came the sound of a bed being rolled , a flapping of sheets , a whirring of blinds . Auntie returned . " Now , " she said alacriously . Dolly 's head was being rubbed ; a snow-white bubbly mountain was rising upon it , a mountain like an island  --  that is to say , like that confection known as a floating island ; she could feel on her scalp the wise , soothing fingers of her aunt breaking down the resistance of her nerves ; her eyes , shut at first merely to keep out the soap , remained closed in semi-ecstasy . " Now , out you go ! " suddenly boomed a voice , as a patter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the vigorous embrace of a turkish towel . It was passing over her body with a firm , rotary motion as of machinery ; she swayed within it like a palm in a tempest . It slid up into her hair and finally twisted itself about it in a turban . A fresh night-dress descended about her ; " to bed , now , " said the voice . The room was gray and cool within the lowered blinds ; passively , Dolly slipped in between the fresh white sheets ; her head sank into the crackling pillow . A little sob rose in her throat . " O , Auntie , " she said , " O-o-o . " " Not a word now ! " the capable lady immediately broke in . " I know all about it . You can tell it to me when you wake up . Go to sleep now . " It was a pleasant sort of violence ; as a harness of flowers the obedience of Dolly 's childhood slipped again about her . She shut her eyes , then like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her round little nose into the pillow . A snifflet of a sigh sounded  --  and as it sounded became the first long breath of sleep . The Boston aunt stood some time by the bed , tall and straight like a grenadier on watch . Suddenly she stooped down and placed a kiss upon the curve of cheek emerging from the folds of the pillow . Immediately she was erect again . " Poor darned little girl ! " she said . She paused again , out in the dining-room , her eyes far away . " He tried that once on me , " she said reminiscently . A gleam of humor lit up her gray eyes . " I fixed him , " she said decidedly . And then , with some tenderness : " Poor great big things , " she said ; " what chance have they against us ! " Upon which she went into the kitchen where lay a pile of viscous dishes , eloquent of the home 's demoralization . When Dolly emerged from her room some twenty-four hours later , her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed a bit dazed . " Hello , Dolly , " said the Boston aunt , looking up and giving the sofa-cushion she was arranging a final thump ; " hello , Dolly ; come into the kitchen and have some breakfast . " Upon the gas stove she toasted bread and poached two eggs , which she laid before Dolly like two triumphant suns glowing through a fragrant haze of coffee . Dolly successively suppressed the joyous acclaim which instinctively rose from her whole being at the sight ; but she ate . Rather mincingly , of course ; but still , on the whole , efficiently . At times she closed her eyes , and then from beneath the lowered lids a few tears came gliding without friction . " Now , " said the aunt , after the last crumb of toast had disappeared ; " let 's go into the other room and hear about it . " She led the way into that little room , which was fairly encumbered with coziness . She took one of the rocking-chairs . Dolly sank into the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both to swing at the same time . Dolly swayed back and forth three times , and then burst into tears . " He has left me , Auntie ; Goosie is gone ; ooh-ooh ! " The aunt 's chair ceased rocking with an abruptness that made their knees bump . Dolly 's chair stopped ; she looked at her aunt in astonishment . Aunt Hester was sitting up very straight . " Do you mean to say , " she began , and then paused as though unable to believe the evidence ; " do you mean to say , " she went on , " do you mean to say , Dolly Sims , that you made me come down all the way from Boston just because Charles-Norton is gone ? " " Why , yes , " answered Dolly , petrified . " Why , yes . Is n't that enough ; is n't it enough ? My life is ruined ! Ruined ! Oo-oo-ooh "  --  and her eyes , ablaze for an instant , became veiled by a filmy cascade . " Pooh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles-Norton is gone ; well , he 'll come back . " " He 's not coming back , " wailed Dolly , indignantly ; " he 's not ! He has dee-s-s-er-ted me ! " " Deserted , " jeered Aunt Hester . " Charles-Norton ! A fine chance Charles-Norton has to desert you , Dolly ! First of all , he could n't make himself want to , no matter how much he tried . And if he did want to , he could n't . You would n't let him , Dolly ! " " Would n't let him ! Oh ! Do you think , Auntie , that I am so low , so base , so devoid of pride , as to keep a man who  --   --  " " Toot-toot , " said Aunt Hester ; " toot-toot  --  you ca n't help it . Have you ever read that fellow Darwin , Dolly ? " " Darwin , " said Dolly , rather astonished at the turn taken by the conversation ; " Darwin  --  did he write ' When Knighthood was in Flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish suddenly whisked out of water . She closed it again . By the time she spoke , she had suppressed something . " No , no , Dolly , " she said . " Darwin , the  --  well , it does n't matter . We 've been reading him lately , anyway , at the Cooking Club . That chap knows things , Dolly . He did n't tell me anything I did n't know ahead myself ; but he explained lots of things I had found out . You should read him . " " I 'll read him , Auntie , " said Dolly , with dolorous voice . " I suppose I 'll have to read now , or paint china , or do something like that , now that Charles , that Charles , that Charles  --   --  " " Oh , Charles , Charles , Charles , " echoed Aunt Hester , but in much different tone ; " you 'll get your Charles back . Charles-Norton ! He has as much chance to escape you  --  as the earth has to stop whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Nature on your side , plotting and scheming for you . His dice are loaded ; he ca n't win ! " " Aunty , what are you talking about ! Here I am , un-unhappy , and needing , needing , needing friendship , and you sit and talk  --  I do n't know what . " " For , what is Charles-Norton ? " continued the Boston lady , as though she had not heard Dolly . " What is Charles-Norton ? A man . Hence , a clung-to . " " A clung-to ! " exclaimed Dolly , a dreadful suspicion beginning to add itself to her greater trouble . " Just so  --  a clung-to . And the direct heir of hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of clung-tos . For of the men since the beginning of the world , Dolly , it 's only the clung-tos that survived , or rather that had babies that survived  --   --  " " Auntie ! " admonished Dolly . " Certainly , " went on Aunt Hester , seemingly misinterpreting Dolly 's interruption . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others  --  well , they starved , or fell into the fire , or were massacred in the wars . So that now there are no others . There are only descendants of clung-tos , and hence clung-tos . Charles-Norton , Dolly , is a clung-to ! " " But , Auntie , " protested Dolly , " he is n't any horrid such thing . And he 's gone , he 's gone  --  and I certainly wo n't force him to  --   --  " " And you , Dolly , " pursued Aunt Hester , unruffled , as though a professor addressing a group of freshmen . " And you , Dolly , what are you ? A woman . Hence a cling-to . " " A cling-to ! " screamed Dolly . " Certainly . A cling-to . The end of a line of thousands and thousands of cling-tos . For of the women since the beginning of the world , Dolly , which survived ? The cling-tos . They alone were able to live , and to have baby-girls who survived  --  if cling-tos . The others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that 's all , Dolly , they starved . No mastodon steak for them , Dolly ; no nice wing-bone of ictiosaurus  --  they starved . So that there are now no others  --  or mighty few . You , Dolly , being alive and well and a woman , are inevitably a cling-to . " " Auntie ! Auntie ! " murmured Dolly , puzzled and horrified . " To recapitulate , " Aunt Hester swept on . " To recapitulate : Charles-Norton is a clung-to ; you are a cling-to . Neither of you can help him or herself . For it is the very essence of the being of the one to hold , of the other to be held . " " How horrible ! " said Dolly , with a shudder . " In other words , my dears , " went on the aunt ; " in other words , you are dreadfully in love with each other and ca n't keep apart . " " Love ! " moaned Dolly . " Love , " the aunt repeated firmly . Dolly rocked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of her eye-lashes . " But he does n't love me , " she wailed at length . " And he is n't a , a  --  that horrid Chinesy word you call him , and he is gone , gone ! " " Oh , my dear , of course , " said Aunt Hester ; " of course , things are not quite as simple as I have been describing them . A woman has to use some sense about it these days . This clinging business has become more complicated with civilization . You may have erred in the details . Now , tell me what has happened , all that has happened . " And Dolly , in a rush of words , told the lamentable story of her domestic woe , of her struggle with the wings of Charles-Norton . Aunt Hester was silent for a time ; then she nodded her head affirmatively . " Yes , that 's it , my dear , " she said . " It is as I suspected . You have been clinging with your eyes shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eyes open . You  --   --  " But Dolly had risen to her feet , vibrant . " Do you mean to say , " she began , and her voice was very low and tense ; " do you mean to say that I should be subjected to living with a man  --  with a man "  --  her voice rose  --  " with a man , Auntie , who has Wings ? " " Oh , my dear ! " exclaimed Aunt Hester , hastily , " you mistake me . Of course , I am not asking that of you . But that is not necessary either . The essential  --  it is to let Charles-Norton believe that he has his wings , not that he should have them . And then , my dear , to be frank , to be just , I must say that this seems to me a case for compromise . Yes , dear , you should allow Charles-Norton part of his wings ; oh yes , you should really let him have a bit of these wings . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable little girl I think you can be , you should turn to the advantage , to the preservation , to the prosperity  --  hem  --  of the home ! " Dolly sat down , weak and trembling . She was silent for a long time . When she spoke again , it was in a tired voice . " Auntie , " she said , " you mean well . I know that you are trying to help me and am very thankful to you . But we have differing views of Life . I am willing to do much for Charles-Norton  --  Oh , so much ! I am willing to meet him half-way , three-quarters of the way , the whole way , on ever so many things , and I have done so . But when it comes to a question , Auntie , of self-respect , of morality , of Decency , then , Auntie , never ! On that , there can be no compromise . Charles-Norton can not have wings . " " Oh , very well , " said Aunt Hester , plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what are you going to do ? " " Nothing , " said Dolly , decidedly . " I will give him up , " she said very firmly . " I will give him up , " she repeated grandiloquently . " I will give him up , " she said a third time  --  and broke out weeping . " That , " said Aunt Hester , " is what is known as the grand stunt , and is rather popular these days . I 've seen many try it , and mighty few achieve it . And you , Dolly "  --  she rose and stood with a hand upon the shaking shoulders beneath her  --  " and you , you little soft Dolly , why , you are about the last  --   --  " " I shall not lift a finger , " interrupted Dolly . " If he , he , he does not love me , I , I shall , not stoop to hold him ! " " Well , " said Aunt Hester , briskly , " I am going now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , desolately . " I am going , " repeated Aunt Hester , firmly . " There is nothing I can do here . And there 're Earl 's socks to be looked after ( he is just entering Cambridge , you know ) , and Ethel 's frocks ( she 's at the High School ) , and then there is your uncle  --  suppose he gets it into his head to sprout feathers ! No , no  --  I 'm going home . I 'm willing to be what Nature said I had to be . I do n't take any chances with those new-fangled grand-stunts . Besides , if you are just going to do nothing , why , then , you can do that without me . " And setting her bonnet upon her nice gray hair , Aunt Hester picked up her grip and marched out into the hall . " Auntie ! Auntie ! " cried Dolly , running after her . Aunt Hester stopped at the opened door and turned . She confronted Dolly , and the will-o ' - the- wisp was dancing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; she dropped her grip , seized Dolly , and drew her close . " Dear little Dolly , " she whispered ; " you 'll do it , do n't you fear . You 'll bring back your Charles-Norton , you soft little woman , you ; you 'll get him ! And now , kiss me good-by . Write to me  --  when you decide . " The door closed , and leaning against it , Dolly wept a long time . Then she went within and in a more comfortable position , wept more . She wept for a whole week . And then , suddenly , one afternoon , she stood up in the center of the room and began stamping her foot . " I wo n't , " she said , with each stamp of the little foot . " I wo n't , I wo n't , I wo n't ! " And saying " I wo n't , " she did . She sat down at the table and on her pale blue letter paper , wrote : " DEAR AUNTIE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a cling-to . I want him . I do n't care : he 's mine and I wo n't give him up . Tell me how to do it , Auntie , oh , tell me how ! Quick , Auntie , quick ! " The answer was not long in coming . " Dearest Little Dolly , " wrote Aunt Hester ; " of course , I knew you would , and I am glad . As to telling you how  --  well , that is very simple . Just go to him , Dolly . Go to him ( not too soon ; wait a while ) and just stick around . Your instincts will tell you the rest . Rely on your instincts , Dolly , " went on this incorrigible Darwinian . " They are better than your reason , for they are the reason of your mother and grandmother , and all the line of mothers that came before you . They had to be right , Dolly , or they would n't have been , and then you would n't be . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel like doing . In all probability you 'll be nice , and humble , and snuggledy , and warm . And then , make  --  your arrangements . He ca n't help himself . Nature is on your side . His dice are loaded . Cling , Dolly , cling . " Dolly blushed . " Auntie is horrid , " she said . And then , after a while , " But right , " she said . CHAPTER IX Meanwhile , unaware of this discussion and of this decision , Charles-Norton , inflated with fancied freedom , captain of his soul and master of his Fate , was having a beautiful time . Tableau : A meadow by a lake , on the western slope of a high Sierra . Below , and far to the west , lies a great plain , liquid with distance as though it were a sea of gold . From its nearer edge , the land comes leaping up in wide smooth waves of serried pines , to the meadow . There the pines stop abruptly , in the leaning immobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From their feet the meadow spreads , fresh and lush , susurrant with the hidden flow of a brook , and jeweled here and there with flowers that are like butterflies . It stops , in its turn , before a chute of smooth granite in the form of a bowl . In the curve of the bowl lies a lake  --  a silvery lake in the depths of which dark blue hues pulse , and over the face of which light zephyrs pass , like painted shivers . On the other side of the lake , to the east , the land continues to rise , in accelerated assault , first in long lustrous leaps of glacier-polished granite , then in a chaos of dome and spire , and finally breaks up against the sky in a serrated edge like the top-crest of a great wind-flagellated wave which , attacking Heaven , should have been suddenly petrified by a Word . On the border of the pine-forest , its one door upon the meadow and facing the lake , is a log-cabin . It is early morning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cabin , in the dusk of the trees , a fuzzy little donkey stands immobile as if still frozen by the night . The sun , still behind the high crest to the east , aureoles it with rose ; its light passes in a broad sheet athwart the sky , leaving the meadow in a lower darkish plane , as if in the still half-light of a profound sea ; it strikes here and there , among the pinnacles , a glacier that scintillates frigidly . To the west , above the plain , which is as yet but an opalescent gray shift , the last star hangs humidly , like a tear at the end of a lash . The rose halo deepens along the mountain top ; the dark-blue dome of the sky fills with a lighter azure ; the star swoons , and the sun peers over the crest . It ascends . Its rays plunge into the pool of darkness still upon the meadow ; they pierce it , at first separately as with rapier thrusts , and then finally billow down into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the sunlight strikes the cabin ; and Charles-Norton Sims appears at the door . Immediately , the little donkey , rousing to life , comes braying to him across the green . Charles-Norton gives him a handful of salt , and with a slap sends him off again . And then he stands in the door-way with arms folded , facing the sun . He is nude  --  except for the abbreviated swimming-trunks which were his last buy in New York  --  and to the light his skin , polished like ivory , takes on a warm and subtle glow . From his shoulders there hangs behind him , to his heels , something that might be a cloak , except that it does not cloak him . It does not envelop him ; rather does it stand behind him in ornamental background , with a certain sculptural effect . And it is white , a wondrous gleaming white , against which the whiteness of his skin seems rosy . Starting from his shoulders , it goes out and up in gentle undulation to either side , and then descends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip at his heels . It is in shape like a Greek urn , but has with it a flowing quality  --  and the whiteness . It is like a Greek urn of pure alabaster that would have turned liquid , and would be pouring down behind him in lustrous cascade . Charles-Norton steps forward  --  and suddenly this background , this mantle , this singular ornament , parts in two glistening sections which rise horizontally to either side of him . By Jove , they are wings ! The wings of Charles-Norton . They have been growing , since that coup-de-tete of his . He raises them horizontally , and with a dry rustling sound they open out like fans . He waves them gently , up and down ; his chest fills , his head goes back ; and from his open mouth , as from a clarion , there goes out a great clear cry which , striking the mountain , rebounds along from rock to rock in golden echoes . He rises into the air . He goes up slowly , in wide , negligent circles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with pointed feet close together , hanging lithe , a warm ivory white between the colder and more radiant whiteness of the wings . He turns and floats above the lake , then , folding his wings , like a white arrow shoots down into the water . A fountain of foaming drops springs toward the sky . Charles-Norton Sims is having his morning bath . He swims with smooth breast-stroke , his feet and hands below the water , but his wings raised above . Their roots , at his shoulders , cleave the glazed surface like a prow , leaving , behind , a slender wake ; they follow above , swinging a bit from side to side , like glorious becalmed sails . And thus , like a large Nautilus , he drifts to the shore . He emerges , glistening , upon a little beach which curves there like a little moon dropped by a careless Creator ; he takes a hop , a skip , and a jump , and lands headlong upon the yellow sand . He stretches himself taut , his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging into it , and spreads his wings in fans at his sides . The earth is there beneath him , in his embrace ; he feels her strength flowing into his veins . The sun is up there , above him ; he feels pouring upon him , penetratingly , its hot life . Content croons in his heart . But after a while , an uneasiness stirs him . He moves vaguely several times , he finally rises to his knees . Oh yes , of course , it is his stomach  --  the old tyranny . He walks to the cabin , kicks into incandescence the heap of coals in front of the door , and throws a handful of dry brush upon them . He seizes a long pole which is leaning against the facade of the cabin , goes back to the lake , climbs a large bowlder , and sitting himself comfortably in a hollow of it , extends the pole , and drops into the crystalline waters at his feet a bit of red flannel . Immediately there is a small convulsion and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like a fragment of rainbow . He whisks out another , another  --  twelve in succession . He goes back to the fire with his rainbows . There , he  --  fries them ; and  --  eats them . Upon which he squats contentedly upon the grass , and fills and lights his pipe . He sits there very quietly , his feet drawn up , his wings behind him like a resplendent mantle ; he smokes gravely his little black pipe . His eyes are half-closed , watching the hazy blue puffs of the bowl rise toward the turquoise-blue dome of the sky . Far above him , a hawk is circling ; to the sight , after a while , a vague melancholy enters his heart , a subtle and inexplicable yearning . He rises slowly to it , his pipe dropping from his loosened lips . He tucks the pipe into his trunks ( that is why he wears the trunks ) ; his wings spread out to both sides . He gives a little spring  --  and is up in the air . He hovers above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though waiting for an inspiration , rising , falling , rising with slow strong flap of wing  --  then suddenly he is off , like a streak , in a whirring diagonal for the high crests . He dwindles , higher and higher , farther and farther , smaller and smaller , till finally he is among the tip-top pinnacles , a mere white palpitation , a snow-flake in the whirl of a capricious wind , a little glistening moth flitting from glacier to glacier as from lily to lily . Down in the deserted meadow , the little donkey opens his mouth creakingly , and throws forth a lonesome bray . CHAPTER X This is what Charles-Norton Sims is doing while his little wife , back in New York , sits desolate in her empty flat . On the fourth day of his flight , sitting at the wide window of a Pullman which was clicking slowly along a high summit , he had caught between two snow-sheds a rapid glimpse of this nook in the chaos of the World . In a picture flashed clear for a moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadow , and the lake ; and his heart had given a leap like that of the anchor of a ship which at last has come to port . When , thirty minutes later , the train , now on the down-grade , had slid with set brakes by a little mining-camp huddled at the foot of a great red scar torn in the heart of a slanting pine forest , Charles-Norton , without more ado , had seized his grip and his blankets , and sidling out to the platform , had jumped lightly and neatly to the ground . When the last gleaming rail of the train had vanished around a bend , Charles-Norton descended to the camp . It was a decrepit camp , the mine having given out . Charles-Norton found the whole population in the general store . It consisted of five men , about which seemed thrown an invisible but heavy cloak of somnolence . They had entered languidly but politely into his plans . The storekeeper had gladly parted with one-third of the comestible stock which was slowly petrifying on shelf and rafter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been transformed into a pack-animal ; and after standing treat three times around , Charles-Norton , leading by a rope his fuzzy four-footed companion , to a great flapping of amicable sombreros had taken the trail winding toward the high hills . The little burro , now obscurely melancholic , grazed in the meadow . Within the cabin , depending from the smoke-polished rafters , a sack of flour , a bag of sugar , a ham , and several sides of bacon were strung , while a pyramid of tins leaned against the blackened fireplace . The bunk against the right wall held Charles-Norton 's blankets ; the one on the left wall was empty . In spite of this empty bunk , which at times yawned with an air of vague reproach , the cabin , with its wide fireplace , in the center of which a rotund kettle hung , with its neatly strung and stacked provisions , had a certain coziness , a sober , sedate expression of assurance for days to come . And it was a fine life to live . He would get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door with the sun . He would have his swim , his breakfast , and his smoke  --  and then he was off . He was off for an all-day winged romp . He made straight for the crest at first and lit upon the tip-top of its highest pinnacle , rising there out of the rocky chaos like an exclamation of gleaming granite . Its top , hollowed by the weathers , made a seat which just fitted him . To the north and to the south , the saw-toothed crest extended for miles to purple disappearances ; within its folds , here and there , a glacier scintillated like a jewel . To the west and to the east , the mountain descended ; at first in a cataract of polished domes and runs , then in long velvety waves of stirring pines , and finally in pale-yellow foothills , to the plains . These were very far and were elusive of aspect . Sometimes they were as a haze ; sometimes like a carpet of twined flowers upon a slowly heaving sea ; sometimes they were liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , like milk , the one to the west like pooled molten gold . Charles-Norton sat here long , his elbow on his knees , his chin in his hand , his wings drooping behind , along the perpendicular smoothness of the rock , and pondered his happiness . A profound satisfaction was within him ; it was as if his blood , at last , were flowing submissively along a great cosmic stream , to some eternal behest . After a time , he rose a-tip-toe , like a diver above a gleaming sheet , extended his wings , and sprang . At first he dropped plumb , into the abyss ; then his spread wings caught the air and held his fall . He gave one soft flap , and then another , and rose . He floated upward ; he was even with the top of the pinnacle , passed it slowly , saw it beneath his feet , and still , with slow , strong beat of wing , continued ascending . It was joyous work ; he rose on powerful pinion ; it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of the atmosphere into another more fresh and clear and more beautiful ; the air streamed along his skin in a clean , cold caress that enveloped his soul . He passed big sad eagles that flew with lowered beaks , their wrinkled and worried eyes upon the peaks below ; he laughed , and astounded , they fell off beneath him in vertiginous circles . The earth beneath was like a bowl , a bowl full of plashing sunshine . He kept on up , rising straight in the cold and hollow air , into a great silence , the only sound that of his wings , beating a solemn measure . He looked no longer down , now . Head rearing back , face to the sun , with half-closed eyes he went on up with outspread wings , an ecstasy clutching at his heart ; clutching at it , clutching at it , till finally it was too exquisite to bear , and half-swooning , with dangling pinion he let himself swoop back through the dizzy spaces , back to the earth . Again upon his pinnacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , breathing deeply , while slowly the ecstatic languor left his body . He was a little afraid of this game , this perpendicular assault of infinities , and allowed it to himself only once a day . It was his dissipation ; there was something vaguely perilous in the absorption of it . So , having rested now , he betook himself to less audacious pastimes . He selected a peak some ten miles away , and shot to it in a line which was impeccably straight . Then he repeated the flight , this time in a slight even curve , flowing and smooth as the rise , swell , and gradual fall of a musical chord . The next time , he flew to the peak in a zipping parabola that was as the course of a rocket . This game was the consummation of the old yearning which , in days gone by , had impelled him to draw lines upon a sheet of paper . Where before , miserably and inadequately , tormented by a sense of impotence , he had drawn with a pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole gleaming white body , stupendous lines of beauty upon the blue of the sky . He liked this . He sensed his evolution . He seemed to have within his brain a delicate instrument that recorded the movements of his body . As he cut through the azure , each flown line was deposited within him in a record of beauty . He flew from peak to peak , in lean , sizzling white lines ; in shooting diagonals ; in gentle floating curves ; in zig-zags as of lightning ; in rising and drooping lines that hoped and despaired ; in soarings that aspired and broke ; in arabesques that laughed ; in gothic arches that prayed ; in large undulations that wept . Sometimes he drew whole edifices  --  fairy castles , domes , towers , spires  --  which , once created , went floating off forever on the blue , freighted with their fantastic inhabitants , invisible , impalpable , and imperishable . And always within him was the record of the created thing , the record of created beauty , etched forever in the inner chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he tried to lose it . With a sudden bound that was meant to take it unaware , he was off , along the crest , at vertiginous speed . He went on thus , mile after mile ; mile after mile , razing the peaks , he passed along the crest like a white thunderbolt , his wings a blur , his body streaming behind like an arrow . His head struck the air , broke it , parted it ; it slid along his flanks in a caress that penetrated to his heart . But always beneath him , like a menace in water-depths , springing from peak to peak in huge flaccid leaps , stubborn and black his shadow followed him . Of all the lines he knew , however , the one that he loved best was the one he drew when returning to the cabin at sunset . He would come to the meadow from the mountains at a high altitude , and then , placing himself carefully above it , he would fold his wings and drop . He shot down like an arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred yards from the sward , opened his wings in an explosion of fluffy whiteness . Out of this line he obtained a profound sensation of beauty , of beauty in simplicity . It was as though he had drawn a long , slender stalk that opened in a white chalice ; as though he had planted a flower , a cosmic flower , there in the bosom of the sky . In the evening , after his meal and his pipe , he winged away to a last adventure which was as a prayer . Leaving the warm glow of his camp-fire , he soared upward into the violet night . The earth fell away beneath him , a blue blur , a shadow , till finally the shadow itself whelmed in nocturnal profundities , and of the earth there remained nothing but the little fire , the little fire gleaming red in the clearing . He rose . The night accepted him with silence and solemnity , in a velvety envelopment . He rose . The stars , at first , were all above him ; gradually new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on all sides ; and finally , his fire , down in the clearing , itself become a star , closed a perfect sphere . He was the center of a universe of stars ; the soft beating of his wings was as the hushed tolling of their eternities ; the rustle of his wings the crackling of their flames . They moved as he moved ; always their center , he could not approach them . And thus encircled , sometimes bewildered , he lost his way . He forgot which star was his ; seized with sudden fright , he winged one way and another in mad dashes toward cold orbs which fled him . But always , finally remembering , he could find his way merely by folding his wings . He folded his wings , and immediately , of all the stars the little winking red one came rushing to him while the others slid by . It came rushing to him fiercely , with a sort of jealous and almost ludicrous haste , its face red with effort . And with it came the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet breath fanned his cheek . Spreading largely his wings , he lit softly upon the meadow-grass , by the little fire , by the cabin , home for the night . CHAPTER XI Man changes . Toward the end of summer , Charles-Norton found himself insensibly altering the glorious routine of his altitudinous existence . One day he was tempted by the great plain that lay golden in the West . Idly , he let himself float down the mountain sides , in long descending diagonals , and suddenly found himself above a farm in the plain . In the backyard , children were playing ; a man was sharpening a plowshare at a wheel , and out of the kitchen-shed there came a clatter of dishes and the voice of a woman in song . Seized by a sudden perverse humor , Charles-Norton swooped into the chicken-yard and snatched a hen which , feeling herself rising in his hand , straightway shut her eyes and died of imagination . A scream rose from the earth , and looking down , Charles-Norton saw the three little children , legs apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the man , back to the wheel , had his mouth open , as if inviting his vanishing fowl to drop back into it ; and out of the kitchen door a wide woman suddenly popped , her lips working in malediction . His amusement a bit dampened by this consternation and by the unforeseen conduct of the hen , Charles-Norton went winging back , the dead fowl dangling at the end of his arm , to his retreat , and that night , when the pangs of his conscience had somewhat moderated , enjoyed the best dinner he had had for many days . This incident reawakened in Charles-Norton a certain interest in human-kind . He began to visit the Valley more often . The Valley was some hundred miles south of his meadow . It was a great cleft that split the mountain range from crest to center . Its walls were perpendicular and glacier-polished , and sculptured at the top into smooth domes and fretted spires . Down these sheer walls , here and there , coming to them without suspicion , whole rivers fell  --  some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight , like shifting and impalpable veils , others in great lustrous columns that struck the rocky bottom with thunderous impact and rebounded high in clouds of pulverized silver . The Valley seemed full of people . They came in from the West , in stages . They lived in a large structure , at the bottom , which Charles-Norton surmised to be a hotel , and hundreds camped along the banks of the river , which wound light-green through the dark-green meadows . They wandered about incessantly , like ants ; most of the time , at the bottom , but a good deal of the time also along the vertical sides , toiling pantingly up narrow trails , laid like the coils of a riata , till they reached points of vantage  --  domes , pinnacles , heads of falls  --  whereupon they immediately sat down and devoured sandwiches . When Charles-Norton had first discovered the Valley , he had fled from it at the sight of human beings . But now , often , a secret impulse urged him to it . He spent days there , crouching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could look down and watch the little beings at their lives  --  walking about , cooking their meals , eating them , or following the arduous windings of the trails with sweating noses . At night their fires twinkled red ; and once , when Charles-Norton , wrapped in the secrecy of the dark , had slowly floated the whole length of the Valley above them , there had come to him , softened and blended by distance , the harmony of their voices in song . At first , he had felt but disdain for them , but gradually another feeling had come to him , they were so slow , and crawly , and helpless  --  and yet so indomitable . A vague pity , almost a respect , swelled within him as he watched them panting , and perspiring , and toiling up the slopes , reaching thus with untold effort heights insignificant to him , from which they presently tumbled down again after their inevitable lunch of sandwiches . This new interest expressed itself rudimentarily in a perverse desire to tease them . Yielding to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the Valley , going slowly , resplendent in the sun . He could see the little beings gather in groups , and see the little yellow faces screwed up toward him ; and upon the stage , gliding in from the West like a Cinderella coach drawn by six white mice , all the passengers were standing with milling arms . With a few strong beats , he whizzed out of range and returned to his meadow , chuckling . He was back again the next day , though , and the next ; and of evenings he began to hover about the Upper Inn . The Upper Inn was a little chalet built on the edge of the Valley 's northern wall . It crouched there , small as a toy in the chaos of huge domes surrounding it , backed up against a great granite-rooted tamarack as if in fear of the abyss yawning at its feet . From its veranda , a glance fell sheer , along the glacier-polished wall , to the valley floor , three thousand feet below . Charles-Norton , of evenings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inn , his head even with the veranda , his body dangling beneath , while he looked through the glass door into the hall within .... Always a red fire glowed there , within a large black fireplace ; and about it , men and women , in garments fresh and clean after the day 's climbing , sat chatting or reading . Among them was a young woman who interested Charles-Norton . She was slim and very fair , with hair that lay light upon her head as a golden vapor , and she wore upon her shoulders , negligently draped , a scarf within the white shimmer of which a color glowed like a flame . Beside her nearly always hovered a big young fellow , dark and handsome , but who did not seem very happy . One evening she rose abruptly , and before Charles-Norton could guess her intention , she had opened the door , and was out upon the veranda , gazing toward him with eyes yet blind with the darkness . Charles-Norton did not move . They two remained thus long , she looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows ?  --  a vague palpitant whiteness , like a soul , out there in the night ; he , moving his great wings slowly and softly , while his heart within him thumped loud . Then he let himself sink silently , till beneath the plane of the Inn 's floor , circled , and rising again , took a position at the end of the veranda , from which , peering around the corner of the house , he could still observe her . She stood there , tight against the rail , as though she had brought up abruptly against it , making impetuously for the void . He could see her slight pliant form , silhouetted against the jeweled horizon ; upon her shoulders , her scarf floated like a vague phosphorescence , and her face was whitely turned toward the stars . He heard her take a long deep breath of the night , and then her arms went up and out in a vibrant gesture . She remained thus , a long moment , her eyes toward the stars , her arms toward the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed to offer itself to the stars . Then suddenly her head dropped , her arms dropped , and she straightened , leaning against the rail . The door behind had opened and closed again , and upon the veranda , now , was the big loom of another form , a form which carried , at the height of the head , a warm pulsing glow , like the incandescent point of a red-heated poker . They stood immobile , the two , a long time . She had not stirred since her first start ; she remained with her back to the door , her eyes out into the void . Then the point of light on the larger form slid down , till it dangled at the end of what Charles-Norton guessed was an arm , and a low voice toned in the silence . " Why did you leave me ? " he said ; " why do you always leave me ? " Her voice answered immediately , clear and warm as a red crystal . " Oh , I wanted to say good-by to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say good-by to the stars ! " " And why did you want to say good-by to the stars ? " he asked , speaking softly , as to a child . " Because , " she said , " I am leaving them . Because I am leaving the stars . " " And why are you leaving the stars ? " he asked , taking a step toward her . She turned toward him , now , and laid both her hands lightly upon his shoulders . " Because , John , I am going to you , " she said ; " because , John , I love you . " " Dora ! " he cried . She arrested him with a gesture . " I have loved you long , John , " she went on ; " I have loved you long  --  but I have fought it , fought it , fought it , John ! " " And why have you fought it ? " he asked , again gently , as to a child . " Because , John  --  oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is something within me  --  which I do n't know . Something which yearns , John  --  for I do n't know what . For peaks , John , for skies , for the stars ; for  --  I do n't know  --   --  " " Dora , Dora , " he said , a bit sadly . " And so I fought it , John , I fought your love . But it has poured into me , John , as honey fills a chalice ; gradually , sweetly , it has filled my veins , my blood , my heart , John . And to-night , John , my whole being was swollen with it , John , with the love of you , John , and I came out to say good-by to the stars  --   --  " " Dora ! " he cried again ; and this time enveloped her in his arms . A horrid , impish feeling suddenly pricked Charles-Norton ; taking wing he slid along the veranda and seized , as he passed , from the shoulders of the girl , the scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his derby hat , and flapped off with them in the darkness . The crash of an astonished chair and a faint little cry followed him for a moment , then dropped off behind . Charles-Norton laughed all the way home . Half-way over he dropped , into the deepest abyss he knew , the derby hat , which arrived at the bottom , no doubt , in very bad condition . But the scarf was still with him as he alighted in the meadow and felt against his hand the humid greeting of Nicodemus , the lonely little donkey . Across the cabin , as he went to sleep , the empty bunk yawned , somehow , with unusual insistence . " I wonder what Dolly is doing , " he said vaguely , as he slid down the slumber-chute . CHAPTER XII Dolly was getting along very well , thank you . Mostly , she was reading the papers . For if Charles-Norton thought for a moment that his indiscretions were to go unrecorded , he was very much mistaken . Cuddled in the big Morris chair of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little body , her head golden in the soft cascade of light falling from the lamp , an open box of candy at her elbow , Dolly was reading the evening paper . It was all about Charles-Norton Sims , the paper , though it did not mention him by name , but variously , according to the temperaments of its correspondents , as a condor , an ichthyosaurus , the moon , an aeroplane , a Japanese fleet , a myth , a cloud , a hallucination , a balloon , and a goose . As she read , she alternately frowned and laughed . Her brows would draw together very seriously , and then suddenly her red lips would part to let through a sparkling rocket of laughter , and then her brows would again knit in concern . The laughter was of triumph at seeing her prophecy come true , for of course , all the time , she had known that Charles-Norton , left alone , would make a fool of himself ; the concern was at the thought that , still alone , he would continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said finally , as the paper slipped from her knees to the floor ; " well , it 's about time I rescued the poor dear . I must go to him . " She sat gazing mentally back over the lonely two months , the period of her existence now about to terminate , and was astonished to find that , after all , it had not been so bad . Ever since the first crisis , ever since she had made up her mind to hold on to Charles-Norton , the worst , somehow , had been over . It had seemed as if , that determination once made , there was little left to worry over , that things could not possibly come out wrong , that the cosmos itself was with her . And so , she had not worried . And she had had a pretty good time ; a pretty good time . Better , in fact , in some ways than  --   --  " Sh-sh-sh , " she hissed , stilling the thought . But why was that ? Well , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring hat ; this , followed by the still more exciting problem of the summer hat ; and now she was planning for the fall hat  --  she had seen the cutest feathery toque , that came low down about her face , pushing to all sides little wisps of golden curls and making her look  --  well , very nice indeed . Then , of course , there had been less housework , and she had had much more time to herself , more time and more freedom . The acquaintance with Flossie , the young wife of the floor-walker in the flat across the landing , had helped a lot . Together they had plunged deep into the intoxication of the shops . And several times they had gone off , a bit defiantly , on little orgies . They would go to the matinee , and then have a chocolate ice-cream soda at Huyler 's , and called that " having a fling . " All this , of course , had been impossible when Charles-Norton had been about . But why ? Oh , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't so much  --   --  Dolly paused and blushed . " Oh , that money , " she said deprecatingly ; " that horrid , horrid mon  --   --  " She rose to her feet to a sudden new thought and went into her room , where from beneath ribbons , stockings , gloves , and theater-programmes , she drew out of a drawer a little yellow book and a longer , more narrow , green one . When she returned , she was a bit pale , and sank rather limply into her chair . " Ooh , " she exclaimed disconsolately ; " ooh , now I 've got to get to him ; get to him soon ! " Go to him . But where  --  how  --  where ? She knew where he was now , it is true  --  but only relatively . The first report of his antics had come from a little town in the California foothills ; the second from a summer resort in a Valley of the Californian Sierra . He was being reported pretty well all over the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the only valuable clew . They were desolately vague though . A man who flies covers much ground . Where did he sleep ? Where was his lair  --  or his nest , rather ? It was sleeping , not flying , that he was to be caught . How could she locate him ? It would take time , to do this , and money . And the check-book  --  oh , Lordie , that check-book ! Little Dolly , always at the bottom a pretty level-headed creature , had become wonderfully patient in the past month . Patient with a determination fixed as a star , as a law of Nature ; a determination which was stronger far than herself ; which was outside herself ; which she could feel , almost , a huge pressure behind her , as of great reservoirs filled through trickling aeons ; and which astonished her . She had written of it , once , to her aunt . " Dear Dolly , " had answered this Darwinian lady ; " you are right . It is not of you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the millions and millions of women who have fought , and plotted , and intrigued in order to keep alive the spark of Life and hand it down to you . It is , Dolly , the Persistence of Woman ; the inexorable persistence of Woman , Dolly , holding Man . Holding Man , Dolly , in spite of his superior physical strength , of his superior brutality ; holding him through the ages . The terrific persistence of Woman holding Man , Dolly , Man  --  the restless , the moody , the incomprehensible ; the erratic one , ever dissatisfied , ever bounding to the end of his chain in blind surges toward painted things of the air which we know do not exist . " Oh , no ; you can not help it , dear little Dolly . Cling , Dolly , cling ! " " That 's horrid , " Dolly had said , when she had finished this epistle . And then , after a while , but this time with a smile ; " how perfectly horrid ! " But now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . It enabled her to wait calmly for the turn of chance which would enable her to find Charles-Norton . She read the papers every day . Truth to tell , they promised little help , for by this time they were announcing Charles-Norton simultaneously in New Orleans , Quebec , Key West , and Victoria . Wisely , Dolly had preserved the first clippings . And after all , it was from the papers that was to come the solution . The paper , one morning , after describing appearances of Charles-Norton in Vladivostock , Paris , and Timbuctoo , had slid from her knees to the floor , when her eyes lit upon an advertisement on the up-turned back-page . BISON BILLIAM AND HIS WORLD-RENOWNED WILD-WEST SHOW PERMANENTLY NOW AT THE HIPPODROME NIGHTLY * * * * * HENRIQUE FARMANO , IN HIS AEROPLANE , WILL FLY FIFTY FEET ! ! " Ooh ! " said Dolly , suddenly clapping both her hands to her heart ; " ooh , I 've got it ! " She sat there , a little weak with excitement , while a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Yes , " she said at length ; " yes ; that 's it ! " Upon which she dressed very carefully , put on her hat , and went downtown to the Hippodrome . Once there , she hesitated a moment before the glazed-glass door with its shining brass plate , then knocked like a little mouse . A big bass voice told her to come in . The owner of the voice was seated at the desk , leaning back in his rolling-chair , a big firecracker of a cigar in the corner of his mouth . His feet were on the desk , and Dolly noticed them first : they were encased in high-heeled boots that seemed very soft and fitted like gloves . A soft , wide-brimmed felt hat sat rakishly upon his head . Hat , cigar , and boots dropped to a simultaneous disappearance . The man rose , and Dolly saw that his hair was very white and long , and cascaded in curls to his shoulders ; and that , what with this hair , the little white goatee at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustachios , of the same color , upon his upper lip , he looked like a French musketeer of the seventeenth century . He bowed , sweepingly . Now he was like a Spanish grandee . But the little eyes beneath his bushy eyebrows were blue and shrewd . Recovering from her first movement of surprise , Dolly made straight for the desk , her eyes set , her lips firm . " Mr. Bison Billiam ? " she asked . He bowed again in assent . " And at your service , madam , " he said , and bent his head down toward her in courteous attention . But at the first rush of words from her , an agitation came over him ; his shrewd little eyes flitted here and there about the room as though suspicious . He stopped her with a wide gesture . " Sh-sh , " he hissed gently ; " this is very important indeed ; we must not be overheard . Wo n't you step into my private office . Do me this favor , " he asked , opening a heavily-paneled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad polished mahogany table , of heavy chairs . She went in ; he followed her ; the door closed . Fifteen minutes later , she stood again at the outer door , Bison Billiam , knob in hand , arching above her in deferential leave-taking . " I will see to everything , " he assured her ; " everything . This is certainly most worthy of being looked into . And I shall do it myself . Myself , " he repeated , emphasizing the two little syllables as though that fact were of tremendous importance ; " myself . " He bowed again , to the ground . The door closed . Dolly , alone on the landing , suddenly slid the length of the hall in an airy jig . " Oh , " she said , " we 're going to be rich . I 'll have a butler ; and things ! " " Clang ! " went the elevator , stopping at the floor . Dolly abruptly became again a very dignified little lady . Once out on the street , however , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost with the last of her bank account the coveted fall hat . It was a furry toque , with a white aigrette ; it came down to her ears and made her look like a little Cossack . CHAPTER XIII On the other side of the continent , Charles-Norton 's retreat began to be haunted . He was taking his flight above the lake , one morning , in the cool gold of sunrise , when suddenly a suspicion , a vague sensing of peril , passed like a cloud between him and the light . Immediately he let himself eddy to the beach , and there , stretched low along the sand , with craning neck he peered carefully about him . At first he could see nothing . Twice he half rose to resume his flight , but each time flattened out again to the same subtle sense of presence . And at last , with a thump of his heart , he saw him  --  on the edge of the meadow , a man upon a horse , in the dusk of the pines . They stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , immobile and silent . The horse was a beautiful silken white , with a bridle of twisted rawhide heavily plaqued with silver ; the saddle , of high-pommeled Spanish style , was also heavily incrusted ; and the man sat it as though he had been poured molten into it . He wore a wide , flapping sombrero , set cavalierly upon long white hair that descended to the shoulders of his fringed buckskin jacket ; the belt at his waist drooped loosely to the weight of a great holster , out of which protruded the lustrous butt of a silver-mounted revolver ; long gleaming boots rose to his hips , their toes within carved tapaderos , their heels , high to the point of feminity , roweled with long rotary spurs . They stood there a long time , man and beast , motionless , a sculptured group but for the slight forward pricking of the horse 's pointed ears , and the man gazed steadily at Charles-Norton , his eyes shaded by his heavily-buckskinned hand . Charles-Norton , hypnotized , gazed back . There was something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the theatric peering from beneath gauntleted hand  --  which somehow stirred Charles-Norton with a sense of past experience . They gazed thus long at each other in immobility and silence ; then suddenly there ran lightly through the meadow the resonance of a champed bit ; the horse , rising on his hind legs , pivoted , the man 's waist bending pliably to the movement  --  and they were gone . A soft thudding of hoofs came muffled through the trees ; it rose to a flinty clatter , which in its turn diminished , and ceased . Charles-Norton , after a while , went on with his usual routine . He had his swim , his breakfast , and his pipe . But an uneasiness was with him now ; he cast abrupt , suspecting glances about him , about his profaned retreat . And during the day 's long flight , something seemed to follow him like an impalpable menace . When he returned at sundown , the man was again there . This time he was among the rocks overlooking the cabin , and was afoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped to the ground . Charles-Norton watched him from behind a tree . He stood there long , his right hand negligently upon the horse 's neck , his left hand shielding his eyes as he looked ; and to the posture , somehow , the whole landscape gradually changed its aspect , seemed to take on an air subtly theatrical , the waning sunlight like calcium , the rocks like cardboard , the trees painted . " Where , oh , where have I seen that before ? " murmured Charles-Norton , intrigued in the midst of his panic . The man mounted , the horse came forward , and with a silvery tinkle of spur and bit , they went slowly across the meadow and into the forest , toward the trail that led to the camp . " Where have I seen that geezer before ? " murmured Charles-Norton again , as he was going to sleep that night . The question was to remain unanswered . The man did not appear again . But on the Sunday following , at dusk , as the lake was aflash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trees . CHAPTER XIV Dolly came suddenly out of the fringe of the trees . It was dusk ; the lake was aflash with leaping trout . And she came to him across the darkened meadow like a fawn panting for her retreat . He stood there petrified , but as she neared , felt his arms open in an irresistible and large movement ; she nestled within them , her head on his heart . They stood there long , without speaking a word , in the center of the dusky meadow , by the sparkling lake . Her face was on his breast ; his arms were about her , but his eyes were looking straight ahead into the obscurity . He could feel her palpitate softly against him , and a tenderness like a warm pool was collecting in his heart . " Dolly ! " he said at length . But she did not answer ; only pushed farther into his embrace in a blind little snuggling movement like that of a puppy . He dropped his eyes down upon her , slyly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping , and a wisp of her golden hair , and one tip of a rosy ear ; and then , nearer , he saw the furry toque with its white aigrette . " You little Cossack ! " he said , a bit huskily . Again there was a silence ; then he felt the vibration of her muffled voice against his chest . " Do you like it ? " she asked timidly . " It 's dandy , " he said . The silence that followed was like that of a kitten after a cup of cream . Then the voice sounded again within the depths of his embrace . " O , Goosie , " she sobbed ; " I 've been so miserable ! " " Poor little girl , " he growled , above there in the dark ; " poor little girl ! " " All my money is gone , Goosie  --  and the janitor was impolite and treated me dreadfully , and oh , Goosie , I 've had such a terrible time ! " " Yes , yes , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , gnashing his teeth ) . " Goosie , " began the voice again ; " you wo n't drive me away , will you ? You wo n't drive me away ; I can stay to-night , ca n't I ? It 's so dark , and so cold ! And in the morning , if you still do n't want me , I 'll  --  I 'll go away , Goosie . I 'll go away and never , never bother you any more , Goosie ; never ! But let me stay to-night ; Goosie , do n't drive me away to-night ! " " Good God ! " groaned Charles-Norton , horrified at the very possibility , and suddenly overwhelmed by a sense of the enormity of his past conduct . " Good God , Dolly ! do n't , do n't  --   --  " " I can stay  --  then  --  to-night ? " she asked , with a glimmer of hope , of hope that can not believe itself . " I can stay to-night , Goosie ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow night , you can stay always , Dolly , poor little Dolly , " moaned the agonized Charles-Norton . " We 'll stay here , always , together , Dolly . Never will I move from you again , Dolly ; Dolly , my little wife , my love , my  --   --  " Dolly snuggled back close . " Oh , Goosie , " she said , " if you let me stay , I 'll be so good ! I wo n't bother you at all , Goosie . You can do just what you want ; I 'll let you have  --  anything ! I wo n't bother you , you wo n't know I 'm here . I 'll just hide around and take care of you , Goosie , I 'll do anything ! If only you 'll let me stay , Goosie ! " " Come , " he said , not daring to give his voice much of a chance ; " come ; let us go in . " The little nose suddenly popped out like a squirrel 's out of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a tear still at the end of one of her lashes , agleam in the dark . She raised her head out of his arms and looked about her . " Oh , " she cried , " is that your house ? What a cute baby-house ! It 's pretty here , is n't it ? " " It is beautiful ! " he said enthusiastically . " We 'll be happy here . Come , " he said ; and very close , her head upon his shoulders , his arm about her waist , they went slowly across the meadow to the cabin . It was pleasant , somehow , the next morning , to loll about with trailing wings , undesirous of flight . The cabin , the meadow , had taken on a certain intimacy , a coziness ; it was pleasant to remain there all day , upon earth , idle-winged . Charles-Norton had his morning swim alone after vain attempts to entice Dolly , her eyes still full of blue sleep , into the crystal waters . Then he fished from his rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he returned with his string of rainbows , Dolly , uncovering the dutch-oven which he had bought on his arrival , but the mystery of which he had never mastered , proudly showed him the cracked golden dome of a swelling loaf of bread . Its warm fragrance mingled with the pungent puffs coming from the curved nozzle of the coffee-pot , set in the glowing coals . He gave her the fish , all cleaned , and rolling them in corn-meal , she laid them delicately in the sizzling frying-pan , each by the side of a marbled strip of bacon . There was no doubt that this breakfast was an improvement on breakfasts that had gone before . Bread is mighty good when one has not had any for nearly two months ; and warm golden bread just out of the oven and made by Dolly is more than mighty good . The coffee had undeniably an aroma that it had not had of past mornings . And as you held up to the light , delicately between thumb and finger , a little trout with crisply-curved tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your eyes smiled into two other eyes ( like blue stars ) , smiling back at you over just such another troutlet , golden crisp , entering in successive movements between just such eager teeth ( small pearly ones , these ) . Oh , you Charles-Norton ! He wore a blanket on his back , undulating from his shoulders , over his wings , to the ground . Dolly had put it there , fearing he would catch cold . Now and then , by some reflex action of which Charles-Norton was unconscious , the wings stirred uneasily to the burden and let it slip to the ground , upon which Dolly , springing up with a laugh , quickly replaced it . This happened so often that it became a game . After breakfast Dolly , instead of throwing the dishes in a shallow spot of the lake , as it was the habit of Master Charles-Norton , placed them in a pot of boiling water , at the bottom of which , with wonder-eyes , he saw them miraculously dissolve to brightness . " You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a silver peal that filled the clearing , then , going into the cabin , returned with his pipe all filled . Nicodemus came to them for his salt , then wandered off again . They sat side by side , their backs against the cabin-wall , the meadow before them , sloping to the lake ; he smoked , and she was silent . The sun had risen . It inundated the western slopes with a cascade of light ; here and there on the crest glaciers flashed signals ; far to the west the plain palpitated liquidly ; and above , the sky domed very high , a miracle of pellucid azure . A big sigh escaped Charles-Norton , with a blue wafture of smoke . " Is n't this beautiful ? " he said ; " is n't it beautiful ? " She said nothing , and so he repeated , " Is n't it beautiful ? " And then , curious of her silence , he turned to her . She was looking about her , at the trees , at the lake , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unconscious movement , she withdrew closer to him . " It 's awfully big , " she said , and her voice was almost a whisper . " It 's big with beauty , " he said . " Look at the lake , " he went on , detailing with the pride of a suburban proprietor ; " is n't it silvery and fresh and clean ! " " It 's cold , is n't it ? " said Dolly . " And the crest up there . Look at it . It is sculptured  --  domes , spires , castles . And those gothic arches . They are like joined hands ; the granite prays . And see the glisten of that glacier in the haze , like a star in the veil of a bride ! It 's all beautiful ! " " They 're terribly big mountains , are n't they ? " said Dolly . " See the plain away down there . It seems to heave slowly , like the flood after the rain had ceased . " " Do people live there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever see such sky ! And the meadow here , how fresh and lush ; and the pines , and the cabin , and the lake  --  is n't it all quiet and peaceful ? " She was silent , and after a while he turned to her . A tear was trembling at the end of one of her long lashes . " Goosie , " she whispered , and she snuggled up against him ; " Goosie , is n't it a bit  --  lonely here ? " " We wo n't find it lonely , " he answered stoutly , and drew her close within his arms . The day drawled on , slowly and deliciously . " Let 's take a little walk , " said Dolly , after a while . " All right , " said Charles-Norton , " I guess I still know how . I have n't walked much lately . " " I suppose not , " said Dolly , hesitatingly . They were going side by side across the meadow , and Charles-Norton could feel her looking at him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you have been  --  doing something else . " " Yes , " laughed Charles-Norton , flushing a bit ; " yes  --  something else . " Somehow they did not look at each other for a time after that , and walked a bit apart . They drew together again little by little as they wandered over the clearing , in a close examination of their domain , which Charles-Norton , with his passion for big flights and sweeping outlooks , had up to now neglected . They found a miniature cascade that purled over a mossy log ; a cave , so small and clean and regular that it seemed not the work of the big Nature about them , but of delicate , elfin hands ; and then , on the edge of forest and grass , a flower , a trembling white chalice upon the virginal bosom of which one small touch of color burned like a flame . And thus , little step after little step , they went from little wonder to little wonder . Dolly liked small things ; it was the microscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adjective all her own for such : they were " baby " things  --  baby flowers , baby brooks , baby stars . This appealed less to Charles-Norton , hungry for big sweeps . And even now , he caught himself yawning once , and casting a look at the crest far away . In the afternoon , in the full warmth of the clear sun , he inveigled her into the lake for a swim . They splashed in the silver waters like merman and mermaid ; and when , after a glistening disappearance within the cabin , Dolly emerged again , she was tucked in a fuzzy bathrobe that made her look like a little bear . They sat long afterward on a warm slope in the sun . Crickets hopped about them ; Charles-Norton at intervals heard by his side Dolly 's musical giggle as one of them struck her . A bird on a long twig balanced above them , and for a time a squirrel chattered at them in mock scolding from the top of a pine . Little by little Charles-Norton sank into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his life stretching placid and colored , solved at last , with both Dolly and the wings , uniting love and freedom , the ecstasies of flight with the tenderness of home  --   --  " Goosie , " said Dolly ; " let 's go in . " The sun was gone . It had sunk into the plain , far off . " Wait , " he whispered , looking toward the crest , inflamed with living light . The peaks gleamed , the domes glowed , the glaciers flashed , the whole sky-line crackled with a great band of color . Then swiftly from the plain a shadow ran up the mountain sides , extinguished , one after the other , peak , and dome , and glacier ; it went up toward the clouds with its long swift lope : the clouds became burned rags . " Let us go in , " said Dolly . " Wait , " he said . The night was pouring in over the crest , filling the meadow , the dome above ; a velvety blueness palpitated vaguely about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torch , suddenly sprang to light . " Wait , " murmured Charles-Norton ; " it is beautiful at this hour . " But Dolly pressed against him with a little shiver . " I 'm cold , Goosie , " she cried ; " let us go in . " They rose , went down the slope and across the meadow . Along the grass a frigid little haze was forming ; it was true that it was cold . If Charles-Norton had been a practical man he would have observed that for the last two weeks , in fact , the nights had been growing more and more cold  --  which might have introduced a disturbing factor in his dream of the coming days . But Charles-Norton , as has been seen , was not a practical man . They sat within , by a glowing fire . " It 's nice to be home , " said Dolly . " It 's fine , " said Charles-Norton , stoutly . CHAPTER XV For three days Charles-Norton remained on earth sedulously . It was a pleasant earth . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they walked , swam , fished , picked flowers , and spent hours concocting , on the fire before the cabin , nice little dishes which they negotiated gourmandly , like children . On the second day Nicodemus , furry and fat with idleness , was saddled , and they three went down the trail toward the camp . Charles-Norton hid on the fringe of the forest while Dolly shopped sagely in the general store , to the general approval of the somnolent inhabitants who , by this time , had diminished to five ; and then they returned in the twilight , Nicodemus a bit wistful with the weight of the many useful and good things within his bags . They worked about the cabin the next day , and Dolly performed wonders with burlap and chintz . Curtains draped the three small windows , a carpet spread upon the floor , and on the big tree-trunk which , sawed off evenly in the center of the cabin , served as a table , a shining lamp was set , promising of calm evenings . " We 'll live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not answer ; her back was turned and she was busy tacking chintz along one of the bunks . On the fourth morning Charles-Norton felt a vague hunger which breakfast did not satisfy . It was with him all day as he wandered on the ground , the tips of his long wings stained with grass . It was with him stronger the following morning ; and after breakfast , he sprang suddenly into the air . " Look ! " he cried to Dolly . And before her , above the meadow , he went through his flying repertory . He cut clashing diagonals through the air ; he rose and fell in undulations like music ; he shot about , gleaming white against the blue sky ; and finally he came down to her from the very zenith of the dome in a sizzing straight line which opened , almost at her feet , in a white explosion of suddenly extended wings . " You baby ! " said Dolly , as once more he stood before her , panting slightly , and his eyes dilated ; " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting his position to one foot , scratched his head . Somehow , this was not quite what he had expected . He had thought Dolly more changed about this flying business ; and here she seemed  --  well , not so very much changed . Within him he felt something vaguely bristle . It was still bristling there the next morning , and gave to his voice a certain brusqueness when , kissing Dolly on the forehead after breakfast , he said : " Well , so long , Dolly ! " " So long , " he said ; and Dolly , from her seat on the sward , saw him leap from her and wing away in powerful flight . He made straight for the crest ; she saw him , flitting up there , a little white confetti in the eddy of a breeze . Rising , falling , darting capriciously , he gradually slid off down the range , and was gone . Dolly rose . The meadow suddenly had become very quiet . A tree , sap-bursting , cracked resoundingly ; the sound went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if for flight , feeling upon her from every tree , rock and bush , the hostile eyes of peering things ; and she was mighty glad when Nicodemus came running to her resonantly across the clearing , demanding a pancake . Somehow , Charles-Norton did not enjoy his flight as much as he had expected . He bore with him a vague uneasiness which no amount of speeding could quite lose . He could feel , all the time , Dolly away down there alone in the deserted meadow . He returned much earlier than usual . Dolly was cooking by the fire in the clearing , and she greeted him cheerfully , without the slightest sign of reproach . After a while , though , he noted upon her right cheek a little smudge . It was shaped like a miniature comet ; it was , rather , like the slight sediment left upon a window-pane by a drop of rain . Charles-Norton , determinedly , refused to see it . But it was there all the same . And it was there the next day when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each night , as he lit again upon earth after his long voyaging of the air , Dolly greeted him with an ostentatious cheerfulness beneath which could be felt something subtly plaintive , and on her cheek  --  sometimes the right , sometimes the left  --  always would be the little accusing smudge . It spoiled his flights . Following the three days spent on earth , the hunger of the spaces had come back to him , gnawing at his vitals ; each morning he was leaving earlier , each evening he was returning later . But all the time , in his wildest soarings , there went with him ... a leaden pellet , a little leaden pellet , very stubborn and indissoluble , there in his heart ... the knowledge that , alighting , at the end he would have to face that little black smudge ; that he would have to meet Dolly 's cheerful greeting with its subtle , plaintive undercurrent , and the faint smudge upon her cheek . Dolly , as a matter of fact , was not weeping all the time , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the preparation of the meals , gave her each day several hours of humming content ; and in the afternoon she would have several good romps with Nicodemus . But there were also heavy hours during which the solitude of the land seemed to draw nigh from all sides ; when she panted , almost , to its pressure , and felt very little and miserable indeed . So that Charles-Norton , dropping like an archangel out of the sky , found always upon her cheek the trace of an erasure made completely enough to show a determination to hide tears , but not quite enough to obliterate the determination ; and leaving in the morning , he felt her eyes wistful upon him in a humble and unspoken reproach which all day followed him , stubborn as his own shadow , the shadow which he could never escape . He fought well , did Charles-Norton . He tried hard not to see the little black smudge , not to think about it ; and above all , not to let her know that he saw it . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flights . One morning , seeing in a sudden flash of naive hope a solution of their problem , he tried to take her with him . Making a sling out of a strip of blanket , he passed it about his waist , sat her in the slack , and rose in the air . Thus , holding her beneath the shadow of his wings as in a swing , he flitted about , above the meadow , rising , chuting down in long , smooth slants , circling , soaring . Once he thought he heard from her a slight suppressed cry , and then , after a while , astonished at her silence , he came down to the shore of the lake . Her eyes were closed , her cheeks were white , and her hands were cold ; and it was only after he had dashed water upon her that she revived . " Dolly , Dolly , " he murmured . She looked at him , smiling bravely with her white lips . " Goosie , dear , " she said , a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't dear . I get dizzy . It makes me dreadfully sick . " He stood there on one leg , embarrassed . He wanted to take her in his arms in great tenderness , but was held back by the tenacity of his purpose , by the knowledge of the peril of such a course . " Go on , " said Dolly , finally . " Go , Goosie ; go on and fly . I 'll stay here . With Nicodemus , " she added wistfully . And Charles-Norton , the brute , still inexorable , flapped his great wings and went away , leaving her there in the meadow alone , with Nicodemus . But he was to get his punishment . A few days later , returning at night , he found Dolly truly weeping . She was kneeling by the fire , frying-pan in hand , preparing the evening meal ; and at regular intervals two big dew-drops trickled out from her lowered lashes and dropped upon her hand . Charles-Norton , abashed and puzzled , went about a while , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . And then , suddenly , out of the corner of his eyes he noted the rag which she had wrapped about the handle of the frying-pan . It was not the usual rag . It was a filmy thing within which ran a color like a flame . Lordy  --  it was the scarf which , several weeks before , he had stolen one night from the girl on the veranda , in the inn above the valley , and which he had since forgotten in the clothes-bag that served him as pillow . He kept a prudent silence , and pretended not to see it , though vaguely tormented by the very menial service to which Dolly successively put that once radiant scarf . And Dolly said not a word about it . She went on with her little housekeeping routine very carefully and submissively , while now and again a tear oozed from her long lashes . But Charles-Norton felt vaguely now that the balance had swung , that he was fighting now at a terrible disadvantage . CHAPTER XVI Charles-Norton began to grow peevish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew along the crest ; " why ca n't she smile once , for a change , as I leave her in the morning ; why ca n't she speed me away with a smile , instead of that look . Why ca n't she be happy in her own way down there , and let me be happy up here ? Why , why , why ? " He was passing just then a deep gorge , blue beneath him . From it his question reascended to him , tenuous and fluttering , like a lost bird on uncertain wings . " Why  --  why  --  why ? " " She looks at me  --  as if I were a murderer . Just because I want to fly . Just because I have wings . Just because everything in me says , Fly ! And I have to carry that look around with me all day long , just like a net , just like a net of crape . Dam ! " " Dam ! " said the profundities . Charles-Norton evidently had arrived at the self-pitying stage  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it ; which showed a certain weakening of his moral fiber . He fought on , though . Resolutely he continued to refuse to notice the daily little black smudge upon Dolly 's cheek . She was more submissive and dolorous than ever . She had made him , with blankets , a union-suit that buttoned ingeniously about the roots of his wings ; he put it on every morning , but hid it behind a rock till night as soon as he was out of sight . But the very elements , the perversity of matter , seemed against Charles-Norton . " There 's no more flour , Goosie , " said Dolly one morning . Charles-Norton did not catch the significance of this remark right away . Perched on one foot , just in the act of taking wing , he had become absorbed in the examination of a fluffy and cold little white object which had just then settled upon his nose . He looked at it close as it disappeared between his fingers in a silver trickle . It was a snow-flake . He glanced upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flour is gone , " repeated Dolly . Charles-Norton came back to earth . " Well , we 'll have to buy some more , " he said , again preparing for flight . Dolly was silent , evidently considering this remark . " Have you  --  have you any more  --  money ? " she asked at length , hesitatingly . Charles-Norton dropped his wings . " No , " he said . " No , that I have n't  --  not a cent . It 's  --  it 's gone . Have you ? " " I have n't any , " said Dolly . Her eyes were very big . Charles-Norton stood there motionless a while , a bit disturbed . Then his lower jaw advanced ; he shrugged his shoulders : " Well  --  I 'll see about it ; to-morrow , " he said airily , and was off . But he did n't see about anything " to-morrow " or after . He had a fine time that day . A snow-flurry was passing down the Sierra , and he went with it along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the center of its soft white whirl , its winged tutelary God . When he returned , that night , a snow-carpet extended down from the top of the chain , down the slopes , to the edge of the meadow . Dolly was inside of the cabin , close to the fireplace . " Ooh , Goosie , but it 's cold , " she cried . " Yes , " admitted Charles-Norton ; " it is cold . " His wings were encased in ice , and he sparkled rosily in the fire 's glow . The next day , though , was warmer ; the carpet of snow gradually retreated up the slopes . It remained on the crest , however , frozen and scintillating . It was a world of increased beauty that now spread beneath Charles-Norton . The crest glittered from horizon to horizon ; here and there little lakes gleamed like hard diamonds ; and lower , the willows in the hollows lay very light , like painted vapor . The next morning Dolly said : " There 's no sugar , Goosie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles-Norton , sententiously . For a few days the young couple , with wry faces , drank unsweetened coffee . Then this difficulty disappeared . Taking up the tin before breakfast , Dolly discovered that there was no more coffee . The last of the canned fruit followed , and the last slice of bacon . " Thank the Lord we can live on trout , " said Charles-Norton , piously . As if in answer , the next morning , the trout refused to take his bait of red flannel . Alone there on the shore of the lake , while Dolly waited within the cabin , Charles-Norton passed a bad quarter-of-an-hour . Then he went up the slopes back of the meadow and captured a handful of grasshoppers springing there in the rising sun . The trout took them with gratitude . " Whee ! " said Charles-Norton , when at last he had his catch . And then , to a cold blast from the East , a few days later , the grasshoppers all disappeared . Charles-Norton took his axe , went into the woods , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grub . The trout took them . But Fatality now was dogging him close . When , with tingling skin , he opened the cabin-door a few mornings later , a cry escaped him . A snow-carpet spread from the crest over the face of the whole visible world , clear down to the western plain . It covered deep the meadow , hung in miniature mountain-chains on the boughs of the pines , filigreed the lake . The lake was frozen . Charles-Norton chopped a hole in the ice , then chopped logs and replenished his supply of grubs . The trout refused them . They could not be blamed ; the grubs , hibernating , had shrunk themselves into hard little sticks devoid of the least suspicion of succulence . Charles-Norton and Dolly went breakfastless that morning . All day Charles-Norton roamed above the land with a vague idea of catching something . But living creatures seemed to have withdrawn into the earth ; the few still out had put on white liveries ; when Charles-Norton flew low , they fled him , and when he flew high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantle . He thought once of the ranch in the plain and of its chicken-yard , but dropped the idea immediately . Dolly 's vigorous little New England conscience would never accept a compromise such as this . Charles-Norton and Dolly that night went supperless to bed ; they arose in the morning with no prospect of breakfast . Charles-Norton moped long at the fire while Dolly , very wisely silent , trotted about her work . Suddenly Charles-Norton rose with a smothered exclamation . In two strides he made for the door , opened it , and took wing ; Dolly saw him flitting among the branches of the pines in mysterious occupation . He returned in great triumph and threw on the table a double handful of small , dry objects that looked like wooden beans . " We 'll eat pine-nuts ! " he cried enthusiastically . " Pine-nuts are just chuck full of protein ! " For three days they lived on pine-nuts . And then , as on the third evening , they sat before the little heap which made their meal , Dolly fell forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that scattered the supper in a dry tinkle to the floor , and remained thus with heaving shoulders . Charles-Norton rose and stood above her . Dolly was weeping this time , truly weeping , beyond the slightest doubt , openly and freely . This was the end ; he was cornered at last , his last twisting over . She wept there in an abandonment of woe , her face in her arms , her hair desolate on the surface of the table , her shoulders palpitating . And as he gazed down upon her , a great , vague mournfulness slowly rose through him , a mournfulness part regret , part sacrifice ; he stood there gazing down upon her as a child gazing down on a broken toy , a broken toy in the ruin of which lay the ruin of his dreams . She wept ; and he felt as if a wreath , a wreath soft and flowery but very heavy , had fallen about his neck and were drawing him down , down out of the altitudes of his will . And so , gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew , the asking of which was renunciation . " Dolly , Dolly , " he whispered ; " what is the matter , Dolly ? " " Ooh , ooh , ooh , " sobbed Dolly ; " ooh , Goosie , I ca n't  --  ca n't eat pine-nuts , Goosie ! I ca n't ! " Her shoulders shook , the table trembled , her wail rose to a perfect little whistle of woe . Charles-Norton sat down by her and took her in his arms . " Well , we wo n't have to , Dolly , " he said gently ; " us wo n't have to . We  --  we 'll go back ! " They remained thus long , entwined , while little by little the violence of Dolly 's despair moderated . At length she freed herself , with a smile like the sunlight of an April shower , and still with a little catch in her throat , took the lamp from the table and set it on the sill of the western window . Half an hour later there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of indecision , during which Dolly , rosy with excitement , was hurriedly rearranging her disordered apparel , Charles-Norton , picking up the lamp , strode to the door and opened it . His lips were unable to hold a short exclamation of surprise . For , framed in the door-way , here stood the mysterious stranger whom twice he had caught watching him in the meadow . He stood there , very tall , soft hat in hand , his white hair and cavalier mustachios shining softly in the rays of the lamp , the fringes of his buckskin garments all aglitter with the cold ; above his right shoulder there peered affectionately the white face of his horse , the vague loom of whom could be divined behind in the night . He placed his right foot upon the lintel , and to the movement his long spur tinkled in a single silver note . " May I come in ? " he asked gravely . " Why , yes ; why , yes , " exclaimed Charles-Norton , recovering from his momentary petrifaction ; " come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a seat ! " " Back ! " said the man , over his shoulder , and to the command the inquisitive nose of the white horse receded in the darkness . The man shut the door , behind which , immediately , a philosophical munching of bit began to sound . He walked across the room with a low bow which caused the wide brim of his hat to sweep the floor ; and to Charles-Norton 's invitation sat himself on the bench by the fireplace . Dolly perched herself on the side of her bunk , Charles-Norton on his . They formed thus a triangle , of which the stranger was the apex . Dolly 's face was flushed , her eyes were bright , but she kept them carefully averted from the gleaming visitor . Charles-Norton , on the contrary , stared at him frankly . A reminiscence was coming slowly , like a light , into his brain . " I 've seen you before , " he said . " Twice I 've seen you with your horse , here , among the rocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , with a smile . " I could n't place you then . But now I know . I know who you are . You 're Bison Billiam , are n't you ; Bison Billiam , the great scout . " " So I am popularly known , " said the man , with a bow . " I remember you . It 's ten , twelve years ago . You came out of a lot of cardboard scenery at the end of the hall , hunting buffaloes . The calcium light was on you , and you looked like this  --   --  " Here Charles-Norton placed his right hand above his eyes in most approved scouting style , and peered to right and left . " Humph , " said Bison Billiam , seemingly not altogether delighted with this representation . " And you saw the buffalo  --  three of them  --  father and mother and son , I guess  --  standing in the center of the arena . You galloped right into them , and emptied the magazine of your Winchester into them  --  but they would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I suppose , " agreed Bison Billiam . " The buffaloes I 've hunted in the last twenty years have known me pretty well . It was not so once , " he said reminiscently ; " not so , not so  --   --  " There was a little silence at this evocation of the melancholy of gone days . The fire crackled . It was Bison Billiam who spoke first . " I 've been watching you fly , " he said . " Yes ? " exclaimed Charles-Norton , flushing with pleasure and doubt . " I have a permanent show in New York now , " went on Bison Billiam . " Yes ? " said Charles-Norton . " I want you to fly there , " said Bison Billiam . " Yes ? " said Charles-Norton . " I 'll give you four hundred a week . " Charles-Norton fell backward into his bunk , his legs swaying perpendicularly in the air like two derricks gone amuck . From the depths of his involuntary position he heard the silvery pealing of Dolly 's laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , and Bison Billiam 's face had a gravity which somehow vaguely impressed Charles-Norton as without solidity , like fresh varnish . The two looked as though they had been gazing at each other , but their eyes now were carefully averted . " I did n't understand , " said Charles-Norton , with dignity , and surreptitiously took a firm hold of the edge of the bunk . " The matter is simply this , " said Bison Billiam . " I have a permanent Wild West show in New York . I want a new feature for it . You are it . I 'll give you three hundred a  --   --  " " Four hundred ; you said four hundred ! " exclaimed Dolly . He turned to her with a bow which held homage . " Four hundred , " he corrected . " What will I have to do ? " asked Charles-Norton , still somewhat dazed . " Just fly . Fly every night , and at the matinees , Wednesdays and Saturdays . The police will stand for it , I think  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . Meanwhile , here 's the contract . " He fumbled in the inside of his buckskin jacket and drew out a typewritten document . Charles-Norton stood long over the contract , spread out on the table . He pretended to read it , but was too agitated to do so . The little purple characters danced in the glow of the lamp . Upon his right shoulder he could feel Dolly 's chin ; it rested there tenderly , with wistfulness , in prayer . Mixed with his excitement was a vague sadness , a sadness , somehow , as though he were saying farewell to someone . But he had already gone through the crisis ; to Dolly 's heart-rending cry upon the dietary inadequacy of pine-nuts , he had yielded his whole being in supreme sacrifice . An exultation possessed him at the thought , a madness of self-gift . He straightened to his full height ; " I 'll sign ! " he cried with ringing accent . He felt Dolly turn about him ; she laid her head upon his breast . " Sh-sh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all right , Dolly . " He raised his head once more . " I 'll sign ! " he declared again loudly . " Well , I should say so , " murmured Bison Billiam , a bit amazed at all this ceremony . Out of the holster which hung on his belt , he drew a fountain-pen , which lay snugly by the silver-mounted revolver . And Charles-Norton , his left arm about Dolly , with his right hand signed firmly the contract . " I 'll be back in the morning , " said Bison Billiam as he mounted his horse . " You 'll give me an exhibition , and we 'll settle on your stunt and on the size of your machine  --  your  --   --  " But his last word flew away with him in the night . Charles-Norton closed the door . There was a little silence . " What did he mean ? " asked Charles-Norton ; " what did he mean by the size , the size of  --   --  " " Oh , I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a darling , Goosie . Goosie  --   --  " " That 's all right , little girl , " said Charles-Norton with large magnanimity ; " glad to do it for you . " And then , nudging Dolly with his elbow , " four hundred a week , Dolly ; four hundred ! Gee ! " he cried . The practical side of Charles-Norton seemed at last awakened ; he danced around the table in glee . But Dolly , singularly , did not join in . The next morning , bright and early , Dolly and Charles-Norton heard a haloo outside and , emerging , found Bison Billiam erect upon his motionless horse in the center of the snow-covered meadow . " You 've had breakfast ? " he asked pleasantly . " Well  --  yes , " said Dolly ; " just got through , " said the little liar ( there was n't anything within the cabin to breakfast upon ) . " We 'll begin right away , then , " said Bison Billiam . " We leave at noon . " He dismounted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with backs against the cabin , while Charles-Norton gave them an exhibition . He winged off first directly for the crest gleaming high in the distance , making his line straight and swift ; then returned in a perfect curve that spanned the distance like a rainbow . Remaining above the meadow , now , he drew all his fantasies against the sky and finally , rising high till he was a mere dot in the heavens , he shot down like a white thunderbolt and landed at their feet in snowy explosion of extended wings . He found Bison Billiam and Dolly conferring earnestly . " Two feet , I think , " Bison Billiam said . Dolly ran into the cabin and returned with a pair of glittering scissors . " What are you going to do ? " asked Charles-Norton , suddenly cold and distrustful . " Cut off two feet , " said Dolly , laughingly . " Mr. Billiam says to cut off two feet . " " Off my wings ? " yelped Charles-Norton ; " off my wings ? " Dolly turned her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's in the contract , young man , " said Bison Billiam . " Have n't you read the contract ? " he said , drawing the document from his jacket . " No , I have n't , " said Charles-Norton , shortly . " Let me see it . " And he read , beneath Bison Billiam 's pointing finger : " It shall be regarded as a part of this agreement that the length of the flying apparatus , whatsoever it may be , shall be determined by the party of the first part . " " I wo n't ! " thundered Charles-Norton . " Goosie , dear , " implored Dolly ; " Goosie , dear , only two feet , and it 's in the contract , Goosie , dear  --   --  " He turned upon her fiercely . " Why ca n't you eat pine-nuts ? " he cried ; " why , why , why ? " She drew back a step and looked at him with great large eyes , and as he met them , he saw them fill slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply ; " I ca n't , Goosie . " Again Charles-Norton had that sensation of a wreath falling about his neck , a heavy wreath within the soft flowers of which was hidden a good stout chain . " All right ; go ahead , " he said , with a sigh . Dolly , with the firmness of a surgeon inexorably sure of what is best for his patient , curtailed the " flying apparatus " to the required length . " Now , let 's see you , " said Bison Billiam . And Charles-Norton repeated his performance , more heavily this time , in smaller compass . But when he descended , again he was met by Bison Billiam 's disapproving head-shake . " We 'll have to take off another foot , " said Bison Billiam . " But why ? " remonstrated Charles-Norton ( with the first cut there had already come to him a certain lassitude , an indifference , almost , which made him much more tractable ) . " Why do you want my wings short ? " ( also he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspiration for something else than pine-nuts ) . " Do n't you want me to fly well ? What the deuce is the matter ? " " It wo n't do ; it wo n't do at all , " said Bison Billiam , in a tone almost of discouragement . " Ca n't you see it wo n't do ? " he went on impatiently . " It 's too smooth ; there 's no effort in it . Lord , you do it as though it were easy ! And there 's no danger in it , man ! Lord , I sit here and watch you without batting an eye-lid ; feeling sure you ca n't fall . That 's not what I want . I want the audience to get excited , to palpitate ! I do n't want them to sit there like lambs watching a cloud , or a bird flying . Your act is n't worth two-bits a week . I want men to groan , children to scream , women to faint ! Lop ' em off ! " Again Charles-Norton submitted himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated his act with shortened wings . This happened three times . Three times the scissors zipped , down eddied to the ground , and Charles-Norton tried again , more heavily , more soddenly , his being invaded by the emptiness of the old days , the shorn days . At the end of the third flight , Bison Billiam remained silent a long time , evidently the prey of a heavy discouragement . Suddenly the light of inspiration sprang to his brow ; his voice rang clear in the glade . " Cut six inches off the left wing , " he cried , " and leave the right as it is . Shear the left and leave the right as it is ! " Charles-Norton gazed at him open-mouthed . But by this time there was little left in him strong enough for rebellion . He closed his mouth again . Dolly interceded with a glance of her soft eyes , but Bison Billiam was aglow with his idea . " Cut ! " he cried . Dolly cut . This time the result was eminently satisfactory . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles-Norton managed to circle the meadow once with heavy , awkward flapping . His neck was awry with the uneven pressure , his fine body was twisted ; he almost struck the ground between each stroke , and as he was passing his audience on the beginning of a second lap , he lost control suddenly , turned clear over , and flopped to earth at their feet . Bison Billiam could not restrain his enthusiasm now . He clapped his hands , he skipped about like a child . " Fine ; fine ! " he cried , and his deep voice rang clear to the crest ; " that 's the stuff ; now we 've got it ! By Jove , " he swore , his satisfaction rising to delirium , " I 'll give you four hundred and fifty a week ! " They left immediately , Charles-Norton dressing , for the first time in many days , in his city suit of clothes . The wings , even though  --  rectified , bulged the coat , but this was hidden by the cape of his mackintosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the city . They wended their way back along the trail to the camp , Charles-Norton bronzed like a farmer , choking in his white collar , Dolly very pretty in her tailor suit , her furs , and her toque , Bison Billiam resplendent on his white horse ; and before them Nicodemus trotted demurely , a dress-suit case in each saddle-bag , another slung atop . They left him at the camp , grazing philosophically on his old dump . Charles-Norton gave him an affectionate farewell slap , Dolly kissed him on the nose , and they then climbed aboard the shining private-car which stood ready for them on the siding . One end of the private-car was a luxurious stable , in which the white horse climbed along a cleated gang-way . A half-hour later the passing Overland train picked up the car , and slowly clicking along the summit , they saw , between two snow-sheds , the little meadow , its lake , and its cabin , pass by , out of their vision , out of their lives . Charles-Norton took off his coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom , and comforts , which a public-car has not ; a faint appreciation of this fact came to Charles-Norton as he settled back , coatless , in his upholstered chair , and with it the first vague snuggle of readjustment . This feeling became clearer after the dainty breakfast served by Bison Billiam 's white-capped cook , and expressed itself in a sigh almost of content when Bison Billiam , with the coffee , passed him a great fat cigar . Charles-Norton threw a surreptitious glance at the heavy band ; it was a dollar cigar . Life , after all , has its compensations . CHAPTER XVIII And now , how about Charles-Norton and Dolly ? Well , they are getting along very well ; very well , very well indeed . Of course , they have their little differences  --  as have most couples . Mostly , it is about wings . There seems to be a something fundamental about both Charles-Norton and Dolly which irresistibly makes them diverge on the question of the proper length of wings ( male wings at least ) . For a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intoxicating public success and before they had arrived to the present adjustment , the question threatened to bring the conjugal craft to a final wreck . Strangely enough ( or naturally enough ) it is a catastrophe that eased the situation . One night , after Dolly , in a sudden access of resentment , had taken an immoderate whack out of the left wing , Charles-Norton tumbled to the ground in the midst of his performance , and broke his ankle . It was , of course , in an agony of remorse that Dolly nursed her husband during his long month of enforced and bed-ridden idleness . Luckily , Bison Billiam behaved beautifully . He let the salary run on during the whole course of Charles-Norton 's incapacity , and then , with genial inspiration , prevailed upon him , when he had recovered , to make his public reappearance with the heavy plaster-of-paris cast still upon the injured leg  --  which immensely increased the Flying Wonder 's popularity and success . A modus vivendi was agreed upon after this , which is still in force and works very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wing question . Whenever they have a little difference now , Charles-Norton and Dolly go to Bison Billiam , and , standing before him hand in hand , listen to a sage adjudication of their rights and their wrongs . They call him Papa Bison . And so , they are quite happy . Dolly , of course , takes a keen pleasure in her home . She has a neat little brick house , with a white door , near the Riverside Drive , and a butler . A butler always had been Dolly 's secret dream . Charles-Norton , also , though unconsciously perhaps , gets a good deal of pleasure out of the house ( and the butler ) , for Dolly , with innate genius , has given it an air of quiet elegance and culture which he secretly enjoys . There is , also , a certain contentment in living life along a definite routine . He flies every night but Sunday , and two afternoons a week . And then , if Dolly has her house , he has his automobile . A big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with Dolly every Sunday . When he arrives to a certain point in a certain highway , where the road is smooth and hard , and undulates up and down like a Coney Island chute for many miles , he leans forward and puts his chin close to the back of the chauffeur , who is French , and looks like Mephistopheles . " Let her out , " he says . The chauffeur , with a grin , " lets her out "  --  and they swoop down and up , down and up , in increasing speed . The road is a ribbon , which she rolls hungrily within her ; the trees , the rare houses on both sides , coalesce into two solid , whirling walls . " Faster , " says Charles-Norton . The world becomes two parallel planes of solid atmosphere , rushing along close to right and left ; the air strikes their faces like a fist , closing their nostrils till they gasp ; the machine 's hum becomes a cry ; its flaps rise like wings . " Faster , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wafts off behind on a current of air , like a hat  --  and he is only a soul , a delicious kernel of soul ecstatically drunk , floating like an atom through the eternities . " Faster , " he says . But he is aware now of a shrill , insistent , strident sound . It drills into his soul ; it will not be quiet ; it will not let him be . Bing ! His body , catching up from behind , drops about him again  --  and then he knows . It is Dolly ; Dolly screaming , poor little Dolly hysterical with fear . " Slow up , " he says to the chauffeur . The world gradually changes from a mere blur of parallel lines to visible groupings of matter . Trees , houses , the road , the sky reappear as through a curtain torn before them . The chauffeur wipes his brow . " Ah , Monsieur ! " he says . And Dolly , very pale , says with an impatience that seems weary , as though it were repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , why , why will you scare me so ? " Charles-Norton is penitent , but a bit morose . " Gee , " he says ; " that was n't fast . That was n't fast . " His eyes go off , very far ; a vague , vague yearning , covered over with layer and layer of resignation , palpitates faintly at the pit of his being . " You do n't know what speeding is , " he murmurs ; " you do n't know  --   --  " The machine , at smooth half-speed , is returning toward the city . " I wo n't go with you again , " says Dolly . But she always does . She does n't like to ride fast , and he does , but she never lets him ride alone . ' Cause she loves him ! He will have to be more careful now , however . The other evening , as they sat in the cozy reading-room ( lined with editions de luxe ) after the performance , she got upon his knee and , hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , whispered something in his ear . Charles-Norton sat silent a long moment after that . Then he said , as though speaking to himself : " I wonder if he will  --  if he will also  --  if he will  --   --  " " I wonder ; I wonder ! " said Dolly , ecstatically , her eyes wide upon a splendid vision . " We could keep them down , " said Charles-Norton , consideringly , " by beginning early . By beginning early , with bandages , we could keep them down  --   --  " To his great amazement , Dolly dissented . " Oh , no , no , no , no ! " she cried . " Oh , he would look so cute with them  --  just like a little angel ! Just like a little angel , Goosie ! " And Charles-Norton is still wondering about this differentiation in Dolly 's wise little head , wondering why he can , while Goosie  --  ca n't . THE
