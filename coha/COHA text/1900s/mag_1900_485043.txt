The Republican newspapers and speakers that are so certain that Mr. McKinley 's reelection will result in. the immediate ending of the war in the Philippines , would do well to consider Mr. Six-to Lopez 's views on the matter , since he unquestionably represents the educated Filipinos . Mr. Lopez , while free from any desire to influence the approaching election either one way or the other , states that the reelection of McKinley will make no difference whatever in the resistance of the Filipinos to those who are laying waste their country by fire and sword , any more than would the election of Mr. Bryan , should the latter also pursue the course of requiring abject subjection to his will . In this , Mr. Lopez simply confirms the statement to this effect of the Eiening Post 's Philippine correspondent , which was published the other day . The attitude of Senor Mabini , a member of Aguinaldo 's Cabinet , of which he is said to have been the intellectual leader , throws still more light on this point . According to Manila dispatches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison after long confinement , because he is dying of paralysis , and despite the fact that he " has persistently refused to take the oath of allegiance . " We are certain that the Administration will call Gen. MacArthur to account for his reprehensible kindness in permitting so obstinate a criminal to die in his own bed . Certainly no sympathy should be wasted on this dark-skinned " patriot , " who foolishly cherishes hopes of freedom for his people , and who impertinently declines to take off his hat to Mr. McKinley . The uncomfortable thing about it is that , living or dead , Sefior Mabini 's example has a great influence upon his countrymen . After election will come what may easily be far more important than the election in settling the question of American Imperialism  --  namely , the arguments before the Supreme Court on the Constitutional rights of Porto Ricans and Filipinos . The cases have been advanced on the calendar and are set down for November 12 . One thing is clear . If the Court holds that the Philippines are entitled to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders will instantly adopt the policy of scuttle . All their brave words about duty and responsibility they would bolt whole , if they found that trade with the Philippines most be free . They might have an overwhelming victory at the polls , backing up their announced purpose to stay in the islands for ever , but the knocking flat of their tariff walls by a judicial decision would set them all scuttling . In other words , they are for holding the Philippines if they can exploit them , but for dropping them like live coals if they must rule them under the Constitution . Burke showed haw the English colonial policy of the last century fatally erred in withholding from the colonies the very parts of the British Constitution which made British citizenship a precious possession . The Republicans are doing the same thing with their colonies , and , if the Supreme Court declares it an illegal thing to do , they will immediately become the fiercest Anti-Imperialists going . Mr. Bryan took the opportunity on Monday week of commenting on the newer problems of American finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the surplus wealth of the United States is at present so great that some of it is overflowing into European securities . His comment , in his speech at Quincy , Ill. , is characteristic . Why do not these capitalists buy land in America , instead of buying German and English Government bonds ? Why , indeed ? The answer that capitalists , large or small , usually invest their money where they choose , would be too commonplace for an economist of Mr. Bryan 's grasp . The capitalist , we fancy , might retort that if the surplus funds of Chicago and the East were actually invested in Illinois lands , Mr. Bryan might start the hue and cry against the plutocrats who were forming a " land Trust " and reducing the farmer to servitude . As a matter of fact , this last deliverance is only another stroke of the demagogue 's art in which Mr. Bryan is proving himself so proficient . When European capital was flowing to America , the favorite argument of such politicians was that the foreigners were , snatching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reversed , the needy American is invited to watch the diversion of money which ought to have come into his own possession . This is a sufficiently direct appeal to every borrower whose poor credit and bad collateral are rejected at the bank , every speculator entangled in an unlucky venture , and every landholder who has bought unwisely and can not sell at a profit . The motive of the last investments in German Treasury bonds is clear to Mr. Bryan . The capitalists indulging in such a practice , he explained , are deliberately carrying out their party 's policy of reducing values . Exigencies of stump politics account for a good deal . Mr. McKinley himself , eight years ago , was got above indulging in political claptrap about the " British gold " that was coming by ship-loads to America to elect Mr. Cleveland . But this was ' prentice work compared with Mr. Bryan 's present appeal to class prejudice , ignorance , and jealousy . The Bryan managers in Massachusetts illustrated again . last week what has become the salient feature of the campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the so-called " paramount " one must give way in case of a conflict . Moorfield Storey had agreed to accept a nomination for Congress from the Anti-Imperialists of the Eleventh District . The obvious thing for the Democrats to do was to make him their candidate also . But Mr. Storey is notoriously not " sound , " from the Bryan standpoint , on the silver question , or , indeed , on any phase of the financial follies to which the party is committed . So their convention insisted upon nominating a candidate who accepts the whole Kansas City platform , and who could be depended upon , in case of his election , to vote for a free-coinage candidate for Speaker . It is of little use for the Bryanites to talk about Imperialism being the paramount issue so long as their actions push the financial question to the front whenever there is a conflict between them . Under the caption , " The Cost of Tammany Hall in Flesh and Blood , " Mr. Franklin Matthews has contributed to the current Harper 's Weekly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way in which Mr. Croker 's institution is corrupting and brutalizing the city of New York . Mr. Matthews brings out the fact that in 1899 the excise arrests were smaller than in any year since 1884 , although every citizen is aware of the flagrant violations of the liquor law . Arrests for murders have increased from 99 to 277 in ten years , while the number of unpunished murders steadily increases as the police wax more and more incompetent . In 1899 there were 1,244 more felonies reported in the police courts and 610 more grand larceny cases than in. 1898 . But these are only side issues compared with the statements about the depravity and corruption of the children of the slums , and the wholesale importation of white and colored women to this city for immoral purposes , and in order that the Tammany campaign chest may profit by the blackmail levied upon all sorts of vice . These are hard things to read and still harder to write about , but any one who cares at all for the redemption of the city should inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neighbor 's knowing under what conditions his children must grow up to womanhood and manhood . If matters are to improve after getting worse , surely the time for the turi  --  of the tide is at hand . In the light of Mr. Matthews 's statistics , our " colonists " may well fear for their future , and dread the character of the civilization which is to be forced down their throats . The Administration should see to it that Harper 's Weekly has no circulation in Manila . No further explanation is needed of the fall in foreign exchange , and the reluctant surrender of European bank gold for America , than Monday 's statement of September 's foreign trade . Briefly summed up , it shows that total merchandise exports from the United States last month were by far larger than in any corresponding month in our history , and that the month 's excess of exports over imports was $56,000,000 , against an export excess of only $39,000,000 in September , 1899 , and an actual excess of imparts as lately as 1895 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have exports increased by the-enormous sum of $129,000,000 , but the surplus of exports over imports has run $90,000,000 beyond last year . These are large figures ; it is doubtful if any such sudden expansion has ever been ' witnessed in the history of trade . What makes the comparison with last year still more striking is the fact that while imports show signs of steady decrease ( they were $11,000,000 less last month than in 1899 ) , exports are mounting up now with greater rapidity than ever . Our September shipments of other than agricultural products rose $4,300,000 above a year ago . The value of cotton exports increased $3,100,000 in September , and trade estimates indicate that in the two completed weeks of the current month the value of cotton actually shipped . from this country to Europe is $12 , - 000,000 greater than that exported in the same fortnight of 1899 . These astonishing figures force again into consideration the question , how and when ? this unprecedented balance is to be liquidated . European holdings of our stocks and bonds have already been practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for permanent investment . The investment of our awn capitalists in European securities is as a drop in the bucket compared with our total apparent credit . The situation , prolonged as it has been , is so new to commercial history that the shrewdest expert on international finance finds it difficult to forecast the future . What wages the anthracite miners have been earning is a question which can not be answered in a word . Individual pay-checks are not significant , because the miners ' wage is a piece wage , and so allowance has to be made for the personal equation ; an inefficient or shiftless man earning less in proportion as he is go . Thit , is well illustrated by three pay-checks given in last week 's Outlook. , The amounts earned in a month range from minus $11.81 after all deductions in one case , to a cash balance in favor of the miner in another case of $63.76 . A staff correspondent of the Outlook , after careful investigation , estimated average net earnings of skilled men classed as miners at about $37.50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three weeks ' work per month . Average earnings of all employees are estimated at slightly over $300 , or $25 per month . According to official Federal reports , there has been a decline in average ' wages from $382 in 1870 to $321 in 1880 , and to $316 in 1890 . It is recognized by the operators that the question is not one of daily wages . The crying evil in the situation is the few days worked in the course of a year . In a word , there are more miners than are required to produce the amount of coal annually consumed in the community . This condition has resulted largely from the disposition of the miner to cling to his . own trade , however ill he may fare at it : The miners are in a fair way to suffer immediately some of the consequences of their action during the strike in forcing men to quit work who were under an agreement to submit all questions to arbitration . This they ought to have foreseen . The operators now say they will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it would be p , one-sided agreement , and only the operators would be bound by it . John Markle had a written agreement with each of his men to arbitrate all grievances . The men ' were perfectly satisfied with the provisions , and had all signed the agreement , which they all broke at the bidding of their leader , Jahn Mitchell . The Operators say that they have made their proposition , and that it is left to the men to accept or reject . Since the men have manifested their readiness to quit work whenever they like , and to disregard agreements as the fancy pleases them , and since they can give no guarantee for good ' faith in the future which they have not violated in the past , the operators assert that they have no choice . If they should agree to arbitrate , it would be a mere formality of no significance , and they could not be expected themselves in the future to abide by the terms of any agreement they might make with their men . To enter into agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement , is putting one 's faith in a rope of sand . American missionaries and missionary boards have resented with just indignation the ignorant flings at missionary life and labor in China , as being really responsible for the Chinese hatred of foreigners . - One- of the speakers at the American Board meeting in . St. Louis declared with some heat , , but with much truth , that foreign aggressions upon China , and especially the " stealing of land " in China , were a much more likely root of bitterness . Much more likely , say we , too ; and yet it is a curious fact that missionaries are to-day among the most ardent in. urging the United States to lose no time in " stealing " some land away from the Chinese . Thus , even the venerable Dr. Martin of Pekin thinks that " we ought to take convey the wise it call the fine island of Hainan . " He apparently wants this country to war . render its advantage of so much as appearing to the Chinese to be disinterested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grandiose schemes for doing people good by robbing them of their property which are entertained and expounded by Bishop Th &urn; of the Methodist Church . He has discovered that it is " God 's manifest plan " to " do away with small nations , " and to leave in the world " only six or seven great empires . " What particular sauce the small nations may prefer to be eaten with , the good Bishop did not specify . His idea seems to be that his six or seven great empires will live in a kind of Mohammedan Paradise of peace , if for no other reason , because gluttony will have made them torpid . It is difficult ta avoid the conclusion that the greatest single obstacle to peace in China is , at present , the intransigeant attitude of Germany . The United States is withdrawing military pressure , and is saying on every occasion , as again in answer to the French note , " Yes , yes , that is all very well , but when are we going to begin negotiating ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friend . Grant that her professions are insincere , and that she wishes simply to nurse the sick man along until he gets ready to make a will declaring Russia residuary legatee ; it is none the less true that Russia 's Chinese policy is distinctly peaceful . So is Japan 's . Italy limps after the Dreibund in China as in Europe . France is not willing to let Germany have all the gloire , so she joins the German-led " punitive expedition . " The English troops go along as being old hands at the punitive business , and able to show the greenhorns how to do it . But it is to Germany that the primacy belongs in aggression and mischief-making . For what purpose did the expeditionary force set out for Pao-Ting-Fu on Thursday ? For vengeance . There had taken place in that city a bloody massacre of innocent foreigners . Therefore , there must now take place there a still bloodier massaore of a still greater number of innocent ' Chinese . ' It is a horrid and sickening . spectacle which these emissaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question here of Asescuing beleagueifed Europeans ; it is just . a vengeful %laughter that is contem1plated , thecity to be made an heap , men rand wciiiien killed indiscriminately , and Ilittre Ones dashed against a stone . It its ii fine way of placating the Chi:4 ' 6We , and making them more ready to be ' Hospitable to Western learning and religion ! A noble Proparatio Evangelica , these Christian nations are planning ! Thank Heaven , this new blood-guiltiness does not stain America 's skirts . In the prevailing opinion of the Court of Appeals , prepared by Chief Judge Parker , two points of general interest and importance are made : first , that a member of a general political County Committee can not be removed from office by the votes of a majority of the Committee ; and , second , that the will of a majority Of the parsons voting at a primary election for members of a Committee may hot be overridden by the Committee it- , - ' self , In other words , the absolute control of the , party ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gang , provided enough voters who are opposed to methods of political tyranny and dictation will attend the primaries and elect their representatives in - the manner prescribed by law . In an interesting review of legislation in favor of the purity of the ballot which the Chief Judge incorporates ' in , his opinion , he points out that the mere prevention of frauds in general elections is not enough to insure an expression of their independent will on the part of the voters . He rightly asserts that the voter , in order to have any real voice in the selection of public officers , must also have his say in the matter of party policy and management and nomination . For this purpose the Primary Law has been evolved , through a long line of more or less beneficial legislation . But the right to express their will would be of little value to the party voters if a machine majority an a committee might overthrow it . The decision seems at least to place in the hands of men who are disposed to be independent in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may harass , if they may not overthrow , the tyrants of the machine . , A decision bearing upon the question of Federal interference in a State in case of such disorder as prevailed in Chicago during the railway strike of 1894 , and in the Cceur d'Alene mining district of Idaho last year , was made a few days ago by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco . Ten of the Idaho strikers had been arrested and indicted for conspiracy in seizing and interrupting a train bearing United States mails , and upon conviction were sentenced to imprisonment for nearly two years apiece and $1,000 fines . They have now been released on the ground that the indictment was faulty in failing to allege that they knew that the train which they seized was carrying United States mails . They were charged with an offence against the United States in their action , but the Court held that it is not in itself such an offence to hinder and delay the passage of a train over a railway which carries United States mails . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail and the conspirators know that it does . In this case the Court admitted that it might be that all the conspirators had such knowledge , or that the facts and circumstances shown in the evidence were sufficient to charge them with such knowledge , but that this did not dispense with the necessity of setting forth in the indictment all the elements of the wrongful act which they conspired to commit . " It will be seen that the right of Federal interference is maintained , but that it must be exercised with the greatest care . The French Socialist Congress wrestled manfully , - with one knotty question . MO ' a Socialist take office ? It was really a personal question , centring about the action of M. Millerand , a leader among French Socialists , in accepting a portfolio in the Waldeck-Rousseau IVIirdstry . How is this to be reconciled- with the fundamental Socialist doctrine that all existing governments are rotten , deserving only to be spit upon and crushed ? Yet there was the ugly fact of a Socialist in a bourgeois Cabinet ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swering yes or no , it answered yes and no . It passed a resolution declaring that " a Socialist should never accept office that begins well , except in very urgent cases , and with the assent of his party . " The eloquent M. Jauras came forward in the role of Monsieur Distinguo , and carried the Congress with him . " Is it not , " he demanded , " the principle of the struggle of class against class which is the essence of Socialism , and does not this principle forbid a Socialist to take any share in a bourgeois government ? " " Undoubtedly , " said the Congress . " But can you not conceive a case in which such participation may : be necessary ? " " Certainly , " replied the Congress . So Millerand , being the " case , " keeps his ' seat in the Cabinet without losing his standing as a good Socialist . Perhaps he is also able to keep a straight face , though outsiders find it difficult . The Agrarians in Germany have had their fling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law something of a boomerang . Suppression of sales by commission for future delivery has not had the effect of steadying the market , which , during the entire period that the law has been operative , has been characterized by rigidity and maladjustment of supply to demand . This maladjustment is well shown by the action of the German farmers in 1897-98 , when , " being all at sea as to the harvests of other countries , " they sold a large part of their crop for exportation , thereby creating a deficit which had to lie filled later by importation from the United States and Russia . It is estimated that prohibition of legitimate speculation in this instance kept the price of grain from $6 to $10 per metric ton below where it would otherwise have been . Since the law was passed , the price of wheat has ranged from 180 marks ( $42.84 ) to 270 marks ( $64.26 ) per metric ton , and the law has been absolutely inoperative to check these fluctuations , which naturally react upon actual supplies in hand or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all speculation in futures is wicked gambling ; that speculation in futures as often helps the farmer as it does the community at large ; and that such speculation is a legitimate assumption of risks .
