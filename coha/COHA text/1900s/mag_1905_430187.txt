 |p642  AT the second National Conference of Charities and Correction held in Santa Clara City , Cuba , in 1903 , the degraded condition of woman in that fair island was most eloquently and ably treated by the eminent Dr. Ramon M. Alfonso , Secretary of the Special Commission of Hygiene . Since then her cause has found a most earnest advocate in the Havana newspaper " La Discusidn , " which is arousing public interest and co-operation in the matter . The Cuban woman certainly deserves to be lifted out of the swaddling-clothes to which centuries of Spanish and Moorish seclusion have condemned her . She is a most interesting personality , and . whether white or colored , educated or ignorant , wealthy or poor , has a natural charm , grace , and dignity which are peculiarly her own . She is extremely affectionate , and makes an ideal wife and mother , except that too often her very affection renders her excessively indulgent to her children , whom she is apt t , spoil . The majority of the women of Cuba belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best stock of France and Spain , constituting sixty-five per cent . of the sex . Much beauty prevails among Cuban women .  |p643  many different types being found , such as the tall , robust type with golden and sometimes auburn hair , fair complexions , and light eyes ; and , as a striking contrast , the more petite brunette , dark-eyed type of Southern Spanish ancestry . The Cuban woman possesses native vivacity and brilliancy , and when given a fair opportunity can distinguish herself as much as her more favored and privileged American and British sisters . Under the old Spanish regime not a few attained distinction in various lines of human activity . Among these is the celebrated Senora Marta Abreu de Estevez , one of Cuba 's most remarkable practical philanthropists , who , in her active career of more than fifty years , established in her birthplace , the interior little city of Santa Clara , so many free schools , hospitals , and similar institutions that her fame spread across the Atlantic , and the central Government of Spain honored her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and art quite a number of Cuban ladies have shown decided talent , the productions of the female poets of Cuba being esteemed among the choicest gems of Spanish literature . Indeed , it is startling to find that , in the beautiful Pearl of the Antilles , just emerging from the darkness and thralldom of the Middle Ages , there should have been born , in the old city of Puerto Principe , Central Cuba , in 1814 , one of the most extraordinary literary lights and geniuses of modern times , Gertrudis Gdmez de Avellaneda , who even in her earliest childhood revealed astonishing poetical and dramatic gifts . Removing to Spain when only a young girl of twenty-two , she resided there twenty-three years , and won instant recognition from such severe critics as Tuan Valera , Jose Zorrilla , Hartzenbusch , and the most brilliant literati of Madrid . Besides exquisite lyrical poetry and romantic and artistic novels , she produced great dramas and tragedies , truly Shakespearean and Biblical in their character , which have been repeatedly performed in all the chief cities of Spain before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's achievements in Cuba are , however , exceptional cases , the great mass of the sex , through unfavorable environment , evil conditions , and inveterate prejudices , being dwarfed , repressed , and deprived of the opportunities for development to which their natural abilities entitle them . While it is true that under Spanish rule the daughters of the highly cultured minority of Cuban aristocracy , and , to a more limited extent , those of the more fortunate of the middle classes of Havana and other large Cuban cities , received a fine education , either in the National University or in the best religious or secular academies of the island , or even were sent to Paris , the masses of the female sex in Cuba were doomed to a grinding struggle for existence and to a dead level of mediocrity , ignorance , and degradation . Hence , to the Cuban woman in general , the American intervention and influence were a godsend indeed ; as , for the first time in four hundred years , the gates of opportunity were opened to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length and breadth of the island . Nevertheless , the evil effects of centuries of false ideals and conditions could not be swept away in a moment , or even in a few fleeting years . The vast majority of Cuban men have yet to be taught to value and respect the opposite sex at its true worth . Old , ingrained Spanish prejudices still regard it as degrading for a Cuban woman to earn an honorable living by the sweat of her brow , and a mild shock was caused when , at the first National Conference of Charities and Correction of Cuba , held in March , 1902 , in Havana , a bevy of Cuban young ladies belonging to the best families , and trained as nurses , not only occupied a prominent position on the platform , but one of them actually addressed the assembled delegates . On the same occasion Miss Mary O'Donnell , then Directress of the Mercedes Hospital , Havana , graphically described the social ostracism and other obstacles a young Cuban woman who is not a nun had to encounter if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous applause , that the truly progressive and chivalric Cuban man ought to respect and prize more highly the  |p644  conscientious young woman who earns her living by any honorable calling . Those who are best informed in regard to the gainful occupations open to women in Cuba realize that they are pitifully few and most miserably paid . On this subject Dr. Ramon M. Alfonso presents some very startling statistics . One can hardly realize that out of the 757,592 women in the island only 60,000 , or less than ten per cent. , have some form of profitable employment . Looked at from the standpoint of race , 448,042 white women out of 462,926 are deprived of the opportunity to work , and 219,541 colored women out of 268,308 . Making all due allowance for children too young to earn their living , there is yet awful and pathetic significance in these facts when one bears in mind that , out of 574,645 Cuban women of marriageable age , only twenty per cent . are married , and there are 62,108 widows . Hence , out of a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses an extraordinarily large army of unemployed women , stranded in the world , who must depend upon their own efforts in order to eke out an existence . The struggle is rendered yet more bitter because illiteracy is more prevalent among the women of Cuba than among the men . Under such conditions , what are the occupations open to the average Cuban woman ? She may take in washing , competing against laundries already established by men of her own race or by Chinese . By intensely hard labor she may succeed , in the course of a day , in washing and ironing one hundred pieces , usually called a " tarea " or task , and earn seventy-five cents a day in depreciated Spanish silver , that is , about forty-five cents in American money , or $2.70 a week . As a cook she will fare far worse than a man , receiving a total per month , including her food and lodging , reckoned at thirty-six cents a day , of $7.20 United States currency . Should she elect to be an ordinary household servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or $5.40 a month , this amount including her food and lodging . If engaged in a cigar factory in Havana , where the best wages are paid , her " tarea " or task , the utmost she can possibly accomplish in a day , will yield her sixty cents , or $3.60 a week . As a seamstress or milliner her compensation is even more wretched . For the sewing of shirts , with cuffs and collars attached , she is paid at the rate of thirty-six cents a dozen , and can never finish in a day more than seven ; that is , she earns twenty-one cents daily , at the utmost . For sewing drawers she receives twenty-four cents , out of which she must buy her own thread , at three cents a spool . For crape gowns she is paid at the rate of thirty-six cents a dozen . If she engages in making the higher grade of drill pantaloons , of which she can finish two a day , she is paid at the rate of eighteen cents apiece . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utmost she can do in a day . For the lining of primitive Cuban " catres " or beds , a tedious process that has to be done wholly by hand , she is paid at the rate of thirty cents a dozen ; but as , with the utmost diligence , she can finish only eight a day , she earns from that source not more than twenty cents daily . She usually does rather better when working on shirts embroidered with frills and narrow stripes , much used in Roman Catholic ceremonies , the compensation for which is thirty-six cents a dozen ? about as much as she can possibly do in a day . She does not fare as well if she makes embroidered chemises , paid at the rate of thirty cents a dozen . This about exhausts the gainful occupations open to the average Cuban woman . Her struggle to eke out a wretched existence might be less pitiful if , at least , the cost of living were cheap in Cuba . Unfortunately , as the writer . after a long residence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse is true . Even when one exercises the strictest economy , living there , and especially in Havana , is from three to four times higher than in the United States . Rents are exorbitant and clothing extremely expensive . The former are invariably payable in American money or Spanish gold , or their equivalent ; as are also the latter , with some few exceptions in the cheaper grades . There is really nothing cheap  |p645  save native fruits and some articles of food . One may imagine what this means to the Cuban workingwoman , who receives her wages in depreciated Spanish silver , the official value of the dollar of Spain being sixty cents in United States currency . Economically speaking , the Cuban workingwoman finds herself ground to the dust . The sixty thousand of her sex who are struggling to earn bread and butter are forced to compete against half a million men engaged in many varied employments . Hard fate and insuperable obstacles offer her no encouragement . Social conditions are also against her . Few countries equal Cuba in the appalling number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total population are married . Only 104,783 , or a trifle over twenty-one per cent. , of the white women of the island are " married , and , of the colored women , 16,501 , or virtually six per cent . There are 62,108 widows against 22,959 widowers . Moreover , in Cuba taken as a whole there are 57,613 more men than women , the excess of the former being greatest in Pinar del Rio Province , in the extreme west , and in the central Province of Santa Clara , Havana City and Province being third : n this respect . This excess may in part be explained by the great immigration that has been pouring into the western half of Cuba . Generally , in the rural districts , there are a larger number cf men than women ; in the cities the reverse is true . The Military Census cf 1899 shows that , in every one thousand inhabitants in Havana and the other chief cities ( that is , in cities having a total population of over 10,000 each ) there were twenty women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the critical ages of fourteen to nineteen , when a human being may be considered able to begin to earn a living , the number of women of these ages is two per cent . greater than the men of the same years . Owing to the general illiteracy still prevalent in Cuba , two-thirds of the population being densely ignorant , the Cuban workingwoman is rarely fitted to engage in any occupation requiring a high degree of skill and intelligence . This is a severe hardship , especially in the Province of Pinar del Rio , west of Havana , where the poorest wages are paid , and eighty-one out of every hundred women can neither read nor write . The best opportunity of the Cuban laboring woman is in the cigar factories of Havana , where she receives the best wages ( $3.60 ) a week , but there is room there for only three thousand of her sex . She therefore generally falls back upon the miserably paid domestic service in families , seventy per cent . of all Cuban women engaged in gainful employment following this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear the brunt of evil economic conditions , but they suffer terribly from the disastrous effects of the prolonged and chronic civil wars and strife which the American intervention of 1898 happily brought to a close , once for all . Before 1868 , when the frightful ten years ' Cuban insurrection began , vice and immorality were almost unknown among the native women of Cuba . Prostitution flourished only occasionally in Havana and other Cuban seaports when Spanish dancing girls and other demi-monde from Andalusia chanced to infest those cities like a plague of grasshoppers . The island , as a whole , remained sound , and Cuban women led singularly pure , clean , and virtuous lives . The ravages of war , with all the misery , destitution , loss of life , and destruction of property it entailed , proved ruinous to the sanctity of the family , and the result was that mulatto and negro women , whose condition as slaves rendered them less capable of moral firmness , fell ready victims , through ignorance , weakness , and wretchedness , to vice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuban insurrection of 1895 to 1898 proved another curse to the women of that wondrously fair land , and it was a dark day indeed for them when , in a moment of blind folly , the central Government of Spain recalled the humane Marshal and Captain-General Martinez de Campos , and replaced him with that butcher General Weyler , who ferociously ordered the whole non-combatant and pacific population to be closely confined in contracted  |p646  page deleted  |p647  and write . Such societies could also , by wise action , aid in raising the general standard of wages and in improving the conditions under which Cuban women labor . Especial efforts should be made to stimulate among Cuban workingwomen the spirit of economy , and there ought to be savings banks where the smallest sums could be placed on deposit at a fair rate of interest . These institutions should , moreover , make provision for insurance , pensions for old age and sickness , and loans at very low rates , something like the Monts-de-Pietes of Continental Europe . A few such institutions already exist in Cuba , notably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department attending to that class of operations . Concerted action should be taken to secure , through the ' formation of building associations , reduced rents for Cuban workingwomen , and even for enabling them , through small monthly payments , ultimately to acquire their own homes . This plan is not untried in Cuba , where a workingmen 's society , the Cletcherie of Havana , has actually succeeded within the last year in building a block of houses in El Vedado , the most aristocratic residential section of the Cuban metropolis . Finally , as the very safety and purity of society in Cuba depends largely on such a measure , there should be proper homes and places of refuge where repent ant Cuban fallen women should have ample opportunity to redeem their lives and be enabled to earn an honorable livelihood . The difficult problem of improving the lot of women in Cuba will require energy , patience , tact , sympathy , and welldirected systematic effort and agitation , and there is a wide field for the exercise of practical philanthropy both through agencies in the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy and powerful United States . The regeneration of woman in Cuba up to a plane where her highest faculties of heart , brain , and hand may be fully and freely developed is even more important than the public sanitation of that beautiful island , which can never attain the truest enlightenment until Cuban women as a whole become as much respected and as useful members of society as are their privileged American sisters . The greatest of her sex in Cuba , the poetess and dramatist Avellaneda , has finely summed up the matter in the following trenchant sentences : " Among nations in which woman is honored , in which her influence dominates in society , there will assuredly be found enlightenment , progress , and true public life . " In countries in which woman is degraded , nothing survives that is great ; slavery , barbarism , and moral ruin is the inevitable destiny to which they are doomed . "
