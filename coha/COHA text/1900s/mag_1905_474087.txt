THE secure life-competence which gave him the means of supporting his sister and himself , in a manner and on a scale frugal and humble enough , yet not out of consonance with the quieter life of those days , " so long as there was cash at Leaden-hall , " operated beneficially ? on Lamb in one most important way ? it enabled him to treat his literary efforts as purely optional and succedaneous . The household and private expenses of the unpretending establishment , wherever it might for the time be , were after some years covered by the receipts from the India House , and when the income rose to four , five , or even six hundred a year , there should have been a very considerable surplus in the end . We know as a fact that there was not , and probably what we shall never know is how much , what a very large sum indeed in the aggregate , was silently disbursed in the form of friendly help . There can be no doubt whatever that pecuniary assistance was periodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one instance he speaks of having received ? 20 for literary work , and some one forthwith relieving him of it ; and such continued to be the experience from the moment when his official pay reached a point yielding any sort of margin . On the other hand , however , there was the inestimable compensation during twenty years ( 1814-34 ) of financial independence , of that delightful immunity from subservience to publishers and editors , which so many of his contemporaries were bound to endure . When he had outlived the period of neglect and detraction , his contributions to the press were solicited and welcomed on his own terms ; and we find even a Scottish firm proposing a reprint , of Rosamund Gray , which had not been republished since 1798 . The note in which Lamb signified VOL . CX. ? No. 658. - 64to the nephew of Carlyle his willingness to allow the proceeding is extant , and it is worth reproducing : To Mr. John Aitken . DEAR Sin , ?

This reaction seems all the more striking by contrast with the poor little doings of the first decade of the century , when those ephemerides , " Prince Dorcas " and the rest , mightily more valued by us than by Lamb , crept one by one into existence . Comprised within the same decade , but hardly classifiable under the same category , were the Tates from Shakespear ( 1807 ) , the Adventures of Ulysses ( 1808 ) , end Mrs. Leicester 's School ( 1809 ) , the first and third the joint work of brother and sister , and Poetry for Children ( 1809 ) , for the most part from the pen of Mary . All these popular performances were nearly unknown till of late , when the Elian cult became so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other recent biographical discovery in reference to Lamb was the publication in Harper 's from the originals in the possession of Miss Gurney , of the Gurneys of Norfolk , of two letters to Miss Fanny Kelly , the actress , on the subject of their marriage , with Miss Kelly 's reply and decision . I think that the appearance of this correspondence was a real surprise to everybody . That Lamb entertained a strong , regard for the lady the tenor of his letters amply establishes . It was the first serious episode of the kind of which we are admitted to any actual knowledge , although one or two youthful attachments are on record . And it was by no means promptly effaced from his recollection ; for , in writing to Mrs. Ayrton and asking her on his sister 's behalf to let her son and daughter , William and Fanny , visit Mrs. Paris , he says that he liked to write that word Fanny . How perfectly possible it would be to build a house of cards and picture forth how differently matters would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union . But I have not the space ? nor the desire . I conjecture that Miss Kelly and her admirer were alike rescued from a false position , if not more . Than a visit to the Lambs few things can have been more pleasant ; but a domestication with them was an experience to be declined . A nobler spectacle and example could not be beheld than the generous devotion of the brother to his sister ; but the ever-recurring episodes , all the more terrible from the uncertainty of their recurrence , owing to Miss Lamb 's mental constitution , must have rendered the place unbearable as a permanent home to a stranger . The absolute homage of the sister to him , who had sacrificed his life for her , was unquestionable . I have seen a ease in which it evinced itself in a rather odd manner . The poor lady , regarding the portrait of her brother before a copy of the Works ( 1840 ) , evidently deemed that the artist . had neglected to enclose it in a becoming frame , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself can scarcely have . regretted , on reficetion , Miss Kelly 's negative response . The official drudgery , of which one hears such grievous complaints in the middle period , is seriously and thankfully to be viewed as one of the healthiest influences which could have been brought to bear on a man of his temperament and in his unhappy domestic circumstances . It must be borne well in mind that the present was a case in which the trouble and the strain were lifelong , and hung like a drawn sword over Lamb from 1795 to 1834 , All other trials ? even the tragical end of his mother ? were secondary ; and had he enjoyed his leisure , had hebeen a man of independent position , and been enabled to stay at home , the tension and worry would have been infinitely worse . As it was , he not only never returned from the office , but never from a friendly visit or a walk , without the dread of bad news , of a sudden seizure of his sister by her chronic disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died in harness with some favored relaxation of his duties , his life might have been prolonged . His was a home where regular diversion was imperative , and during nine years he had it not . The circumstances ? sad enough ? which attended his last moments are familiar ; but the precise facts respecting his death and the contributory agency to the fatal fall are involved in mystery ? that is to say , it is immeasurably preferable to let them so rest . Some at the time could not have been at any loss to divine the truth ; but they kept their counsel , and T shall do the same . No friendly eye is recorded as having witnessed the end ; his sister was in another room , unconscious of her loss ; and when Talfourd , one of the executors , arrived , the change in the features had been so shockingly rapid that he scarcely recognized his old friend . There was , no doubt , a constitutional predisposition to such an issue . It has been the fortune of the present writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's epistolary remains in the autograph as any one , and they afford the common impression of having been written on the property of the English Company trading to the Indies ? rough , soiled , or discolored foolscap or odd wastrel , unmathematically folded : and so it was to the last , as if on retirement from his desk at Leadenhall this clerk of clerks had tacitly reserved the freedom of the stationery department , notwithstanding an alleged order of the directors , noted in a letter to the Kenneys of October , 1826 , that no gratuitous writing material was to be allowed even to the staff . He , in fact , revisited his old haunts not only quarterly to draw his " hit of pension , " but from time to time for distraction 's or companionship 's rake ; and so late as 1829 letters and even . parcels were addressed to him there . Canon Ainger almost derided the idea of putting into type the briefer notes . But in the first place these occupy an inconsiderable space ; and secondly they not seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is considered to have been , which induced Lamb to destroy all letters from private correspondents , and which the present writer was disposed to ascribe to a desire to invest with au appearance of consistency his committal to the flames of those received during early troubles , was not , after all , so peculiar ; and , in fact , followed the usual practice in the absence of special circumstances , or where the communications were made almost with an eye to ulterior publicity , As a matter of strict fact , among the notelet class , even the shortest of the short , there is sometimes more than appears on the surface , or the missive is all essence . Take one --  -- -a single line ? of 1820 to J. Proctor ( not Procter noconnection , except through the Muses ) , and what do we get ?  - -  - that Lamb had such a correspondent , that he was anxious for him to meet Wordsworth , and that he was not improbably of kin to William Proctor , author of Rosamond , Memories , and other Poems ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be no account ? The Proctors were clearly parsons of literary tastes ; their name is a new one on the Elian roll . I am induced to append two unpublished letters ? or something between letters and notes ? to Cowden Clarke and Mrs. Holeroft . Clarke periodically forwarded to his correspondent parcels of new books , about which the recipient did his best to say a civil word . The letter to Mrs. IL ? indubitably , I think , Mrs. Holeroft , before she remarried James Kenney ? is almost distressingly curious as a glimpse of the Lamb interior , from first to last old-fashioned and unpatrician to an extraordinary degree : ( Postmarked : May 17 , 1828 . ) To Charles Cowden Clarke . .

Messrs . Broudwood had a man named Ries , a German , on the staff at one time , a who knew Lamb and his set . Ries used to tell a story of being at Alsager 's with Lamb , Coleridge , Southey , etc. , at dinner , and while Lamb was peeling an orange the talk happened to turn to the subject of the river Rhine , probably from Coleridge 's German experiences . When they had been discoursing some time , Lamb completed the peeling process , and threw the peel up the table , saying , " There 's the Rine . " Ries , in repeating the anecdote , observed to my informant , " I did not think that funny not at all . " Doubtless a good deal of the point lay in the gesture and utterance . Ries 's father had taught Beethoven , and Ries himself was an excellent performer on the violoncello . He once spoke to Lamb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , " you make music , do you ? " In later days , when he had formed a close acquaintance with the Novellos , he took a certain interest in musical matters , and there is a note to Cowden Clarke , not in the editions of the correspondence , where the essayist , writing from the Hoods ' at Winehmore Hill in reference to the musical festival at Westminster Abbey in 1834 , says : " We heard the music in the Abbey at Winehmore Hill ! and the notes were incomparably soften 'd by the distance . Novello 's chromatics were distinctly audible . Clara was faulty in B flat . Otherwise she sang like an angel . The trombone and Beethoven 's waltzes were the best . Who played the oboe ? " Some one had been enlarging to Lamb on the unfavorable qualities of an acquaintance , and exhausting the vocabulary of vituperation , when Lamb quietly interposed with , " Oh , then , what you mean to say is , he was not a good man . " There was on another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fig for your date , " said Lamb . One of his colleagues at the India House happened to be courting a rich widow at Brighton , and one day a messenger was summoned to his room to fetch a parcel which had to go to the lady . On his way back the man passed Lamb 's desk , and he stopped him , asking to look at the address . " Oh , " said he , " it is not complete , " and before " Mrs. ? " he inserted Dear , remarking that the gentleman had forgotten to put the word in . In a copy of Elia(1823) , sent as a gift to Mrs. Ayrton , the donorauthor wrote : " Mrs. Ayrton , with C. Lamb 's kind regards . N. B. ? Do n't show this to Mr. A. Men are so jealous ; at all events it is well to be prudent . " He was dining at a friend 's , and in an adjoining room were some noisy children . Lamb filled his glass , and lifting it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Herod ! " In many cases the jeux d'esprit uttered by Lamb derived an additional piquancy from his tendency to stammer . I have thought that such a habit may have been at all events confirmed or strengthened by the aim at producing an impromptu effect . It has been said that Hoffmann , the French critic , did the same thing , " so as to get time to think over his impertinences . " Apropos of the above-noted episode of the widow at Brighton , there are those others already narrated by me in the two Lamb and Hazlitt Collections ( 1897-19110 ) . These practical jokes and this horse - play remind us of the pranks played by Lamb and Coleridge in the early Temple days . The former , in spite of adverse conditions , retained his animal spirits longer than the friend of his youth . The Dissertation on Roast Pig is a jest in the form of an essay . I have already elsewhere related what I had found to be the groundwork of it , as the exact history of the matter continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the Italian work of Bistonio ? E/ogi del Porco ? explained to him by some linguist of his acquaintance , who gave him the volume , or met with it on his shelves ( for Lamb possessed it ) ; but the older if not the original notion is in the Arabian writers , and consists in the accidental revelation of the virtue of a flame kindled by the friction of reeds on a piece of fish thrown into it as an experiment by a philosophical recluse . Lamb 's Chinese MS. was not therefore , after all , so far from the truth ; but the Arabic authority makes the discovery to have been more inexpensive . Linguistically , Chinese , Arabic , and even Italian were one to Lamb ; but Manning had studied Chinese , and was the essayist 's Chinese philosopher ; and probably the two conned over Bistonio , and in putting the idea into English deemed it wise to lay the scene of the exploit in a remoter land ? Manning 's China . Not the least if not one of the foremost points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring with perfect clearness before his readers , is that , albeit he was , like Sydney Smith , a merciless humorist , he could become , like Sydney Smith , as grave and earnest on occasion and at need as any man ever born ; and this unquestionable fact Canon Ainger was unable to comprehend or accept . Yet the Canon , in common with us all , had before him the letters to Bernard Barton , to the Wordsworths , to the Rev. Edward Irving , the Rev. William Hazlitt , ? nay , to HasIitt himself , ? and that odd communication to Mrs. Badams , limited to the gravest and soberest technicality , on the game of chess . Nevertheless , in the case of the lawsuit in which Lamb 's brother involved him , we are instructed to look on the details as a tissue of broad fun , as an elaborate attempt to impose on the credulity of a correspondent . But there was a second parallel example of what I can not help calling editorial obliquity in connection with the murder of Danby in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nenneys personally mentioned to me the circumstance that Lamb had been seen at the Crown and Horseshoe in the village , while the murderers and their victim were drinking and playing dominoes there , and that he had been required to attend before the magistrate to state what he knew of the facts , but was at once discharged , as it was shown that he had left the house before Danby and the rest went away . A long letter to Louisa Wants ( half-sister to my informant ) , of December 31 , 1832 , supplies all the particulars , and its language by no means breathes the air of a fiction or a hoax . Canon Ainger seems to have thought that Lamb could utter or do nothing serious outside normal domestic and official transactions ; and I am not sure that he did not follow here the lead of Talfourd . Of course Lamb had no concern in the subsequent trial of the murderers , of which the full text appears in the Annual Register for 1833 . On the other hand , the newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rely exclusively on a paper attributed to him , in which he is supposed to confess that he was once subjected to the punishment for some offence , and strikes me as a humorous or fantastic hyperbole , and as amounting to no more than his voluntary encasement of his feet under some circumstances unknown in this now obsolete machine . The reality of the incident is immensely improbable . Canon Ainger and Mr. Justice Talfourd did not stand alone in imagining that Lamb was incessantly and exclusively on the track of some humorous invention , and that the ordinary business of life had no existence for him . Professor Morley judged that the names of the Eenchcrs in the Inner Temple in one of the essays were fictitious even with that of Samuel Salt among them . Mr. Twopenny , though not a bencher , was a member of the Inn . As to Mingey with the Iron Hand , whose name and description had also inspired the professor with misgivings , he was living from 1792 to 1796 at 25 Bedford Row , according to Wheatley 's Cunningham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook serve as a substitute . It is not merely that Lamb reflected in his letters , like everybody else , fluctuating moods ; but , which is more significant , he knew how to adapt himself to the feelings , circumstances , and training of the persons whom he addressed . We may collect that there were days , after his retirement , when as many as a dozen communications were sent , when to take pen in hand was a wholesome distraction as well as a duty , and if those were critically examined , they would prove to be all different and all characteristic . In more than half the number , out of an aggregate of several hundreds , the broad humor would be conspicuously absent . The youthful letters to Coleridge , Southey , and Wordsworth are assuredly serious enough ; he is here and there playful , here and there mildly facetious ; but there is no coarse vein of obstreperous hilarity ; all his correspondence with Barton is as decorous as it is interesting and occasionally ( as in the Blake letter ) sublime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in writing to Hood , Patmore , Cowden Clarke , and a few others . It was not often that , in writing to Coleridge , he permitted himself such license as occurs in an unpublished note of 1826 : " Do you know any poor solitary human that wants that cordial to life ? a true friend ? I can spare him twenty ; he shall have ' em good cheap . I have gallipots of ' em , genuine balm of cares , a-going , a-going , a-going . " The evolution of humor and the proneness to jest are perhaps traceable back to school days , to the companionship of James White , Valentine le Grice , and D'Arey Thompson , the first two names familiar to excess , the last far less so , as Thompson , who wrote a little volume called Nursery Nonsense , is scarcely remembered to-day . There was , too , the semiserious vein and tone , half jest , half earnest , where even a matter of real gravity , a source of deep regret , might . he lightly touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters , he refers to a comparatively new acquaintance as being " on the top ladder of his regard , from which an angel or two are descending . " Verily , oddly as it may sound , Lamb was a sort of bibliographer and a student of certain faddish minuticr in the direction of titles and perfect examples ? perfect , not fine , nor finely clothed . Not that he was a Dibdin , or Heber , or Duke of Roxburghe ; but he was a stickler for having his pet authors in a particular format ? that in which they first saw the light . He would have turned away with displeasure from a reproduction of such a hook as the Religio Medici or the Compleat Angler on a cramped page and damp paper in cheap blurred type . His Burton was introduced to the world in quarto , and in quarto he possessed him ; but he tolerated the Knight of Norwich in folio , ? perhaps between the covers were found ready to his hand that triplicity of treasures : the Religio , the Urn-Burial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . During years I had made it my endeavor to replace the 13ibliotheen Eliana on the shelves which so long held it ; the fruits of my researches are before the world ; and it must be admitted that its interest and charm were those reflected by the distinguished owner , who by a subtle inspiration quickened into a strange life and lifted into artificial importance a few handsful of literary wares , casualgleanings from stall or barrow . It was a most inelegant , un-Grolieresque , ungentlemanly collection -- did not Lamb himself stigmatize it as a ragged regiment in common with his acquaintances , or some of them ? ? yet specimens of it , no matter how insignificant , are ever sought with avidity . The class of books which he bought were just such as we are permitted from a few stray survivals to conclude that his father had bought before him ? volumes , even odd ones , which struck him , as be passed along a thoroughfare , as curious or interesting , and within his resources . A sovereign for the Beaumont and Fletcher was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mazarin Bible or a Fust Psalter ; and its acquisition cost , if not much money , much thought . Not exactly all the books which Lamb possessed remained in his hands . Some , as the facsimile First Hamlet , which he presented to Mitford , he gave away , and others he threw away ? even presentation copies . I am uncertain whether the latter was the fate of Payne Collier 's Poet 's Pilgrimage ( 1822 ) ; probably not , as it was in a sense protected by a graceful copy of verses from the donor 's pen , as follows : To Charles Lamb . Charles , to your - liberal censure I commit This book , which I will say with judgment cool Is worth au hour : I were too gross a fool Not to say that ? for I have printed it .

The British Museum has more or less recently acquired a few of the gems from the Elian Library , the Beaumont and Fletcher included , with MSS. notes by Lamb and Coleridge . But the bulk is , I believe , in the United States .
