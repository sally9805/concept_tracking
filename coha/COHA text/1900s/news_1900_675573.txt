txt LOUISVILLE . Ky. , Nov. la ? The Louisville and Clay City Banks have long since charged off notes of Francis D. Carley for $31,000 as dead asset- Carley is first remembered here as a school teacher . He came from some remote Indiana town to Louisville about twentyfive years ago and began business in a small way , where in partnership with W. E. Chess he opened a paint and oil store under the firm name of Chess , Carley &; Co . The firm soon built up a lucrative business , and about twelve years later the Standard Oil Company absorbed it . From this sale Carley made a small fortune , said to have been about $600,000 . Carley then undertook the construction of the Kentucky Union Railroad . He organized a company to build the road , but after it had spent a vast amount of money in the enterprise it became apparent that , it could not continue , and , on motion of some of the stockholders , it was thrown in the hands of a receiver , Shortly after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resin market . It was said at the time that the Standard Oil Company gave him financial aid in this scheme , which proved a failure , and which cost both dearly . During his early days here he organized a company known as the City Gas Light Company , whose purpose was to manufacture gas . A charter was rushed through the Council and several mains were placed under the streets , but shortly after the organization the old gas company bought out the company and its business was discontinued . Carley took a great deal of interest in religious work , and is said to have been quite a liberal giver to his church . At one time he was President of the Young Men 's Christian Association here . RESCUE BY A POLICEMAN . He Leaps from a Harlem Bridge at Night to Save a Man . Hundreds of persons who happened to be on the Madison Avenue Bridge over the Harlem River soon after 9 o'clock last night ' were thrilled by the daring act of a bicycle policeman who risked ** life to save another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conealy , leaped from the bridge between 35 and 40 feet above the water line in answer to the cries of Joseph O'Connor , who was struggling in the river underneath . The spot where the accident took place was dark , and the water and the drowning man as he rose and sank were just discernible . Together with some other men O'Connor had been fishing on the canalboat Three Brothers , which lay at anchor almost directly under the bridge . The fish did not bite fast enough , so the party gave up trying to catch any and began to wrestle on deck . Their play was good-natured , but in some manner O'Connor slipped and lost his balance and fell overboard . Being unable to swim , he began to drift rapidly toward midstream , for the tide washes very swiftly at that point , and it was then running flood . When he saw himself well out of reach of the canalboat he began to yell loudly for help . Then he sank  --  once , twice . As he rose each time there went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid . But nobody in all the crow , dared to jump to the rescue of the drowning man . Just then Policeman Conealy came along at a rapid clip on his wheel . Hearing the cries of the man in the water below and the answering groans of sympathy from those on the bridge he stopped quickly , dropped his wheel on the floor of the bridge , and ran to the edge . A second later he was taking off his coat , and then , before any one had time to think what he was about , he had climbed over the railing , and was flying through the air toward the dark river , on the surface of which O'Connor 's head had just appeared-for the third time . Conealy struck the water twenty feet from O'Connor , but as the latter went down again the policeman was seen to come to the surface not a yard away from him . Then Conealy dived . After a second the two came up struggling furiously . O'Connor had almost lost consciousness , and was making the drowning man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , still struggling . Together they rose again , and this time it could be seen that Conealy was pretty nearly exhausted . But he still managed to retain his hold on O'Connor . Meanwhile Capt . James Murphy of the Three Brothers had been getting into a skiff as fast as he could , and as Conealy and O'Connor were about to find a watery grave in each other 's arms he pulled his boat alongside and hauled them to safety . When the pair were brought ashore they were both unconscious . O'Connor seemed to be dead while his deliverer was apparently not far from it . An ambulance was called from the Harlem Hospital . The physicians revived the policeman without difficulty , but it was more than half an hour before they succeeded in bringing O'Connor to life . The latter was still in a very critical condition late last night .
