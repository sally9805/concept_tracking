MADAME SARAH BERNHARD and Monsieur Constant Coquelin , who have not acted together for twenty years , are now entering upon a prolonged tour in America , extending over several months . The moment is therefore a suitable one for a comprehensive glance at the careers of the two great French actors . Sarah Bernhardt is of Dutch extraction , but by race an Israelite ; she is , however , French by birth , having been born in Paris , and educated there at a Roman Catholic convent . An irresistible vocation impelled her towards the stage , and she followed the conventional course by entering the Conservatoire at Paris . There she became the pupil of two illustrious instructors , Provost and Sanson . She was awarded the prize in tragedy , and was at once engaged , although still very young , at the Comedie Francaise , where she made her first appearance in the part of Iphigenie . In this she achieved a great success , but the regulations of the Comedie , which gave to its associates the right to reserve for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the young artist 's enthusiasm . She left the Comedie Frangaise for the Theatre du Gymnase , where , however , she made only a temporary stay . She was engaged in 1867 to play leading parts at the Odeon Theatre . Her real career before the Parisian public dates from this time . She acted either in tragedy or in comedy ? for her talent even at this time was marvellously versatile ? and she appeared successively as Armande in Les Femmes savantes , as Cordelia in King Lear , and as Zavietto in Le Passant . She assured the success of Monsieur Coppee 's work , in the character of the young poet , and became the most popular of actresses . It was not until after the war of 1870 that she returned to the Comedie Francaise . Sarah Bernhardt remained for seven years at the Comedie Francaise . It was there that she established her reputation as the greatest of contemporary tragediennes . Her classic repertoire included all the great characters of Racine , Phedre and Andromaque being those in which she excited especial admiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she understood how to add the beauties of interpretation to those of her own personality . Her genius shone in the quiet impersonations of Zaire and of Alcmene . The romantic dramas of Victor Hugo , which have now become classic in France , furnished her with the occasion for reappearing as the Queen in Ruy Blas , and for presenting in Hernani an ideal Dona Sol . She created the part of Berthe in La Fille de Roland , the finest tragedy of the last quarter of a century , and for that of the old blind woman in Rome vaincue she was content to lay aside all the charms of youth . She created a number of other parts in dramatic comedy at this time , amongst which she excelled in Octave Feuillet 's Sphinx , and in Dumas 's L'Et rangere . Chafing under the annoyances which for years , in spite of her brilliant successes , embittered her career in the Comedie FranQaise , Sarah Bernhardt began a series of foreign tours . She appeared first in London and in Copenhagen as Frou-Frou and as Adrienne Lecouvreur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ITer reappearance in Paris was at the theatre L'Ambigu , of which her son , Monsieur Maurice Bernhardt , was at that time manager . She also acted at the Trocadero , where she appeared ? and in doing so excited much curiosity ? as Pierrot in a pantomime of Monsieur Richepin ; and she then established herself temporarily at the Vaudeville , where she produced Fedora , which Monsieur Sardou had written expressly for her . But Sarah  | Bernhardt had always wished to have a theatre of her own . She therefore rented that of the Porte Saint-Martin , which , however , she only retained a short time , although she continued to appear there upon the stage after she had retired from the management . Here she produced La Dame aux Camelias , and established her own interpretation of the character of Dumas 's heroine , in doing which she caused Madame Docile , who had created the part of Maria Duplessis ( and who was just dead ) , to be entirely forgotten . She also appeared in Monsieur Richepin 's drama Nana Sahib , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made himself a comedian in order to interpret his own work , and also , it is said , from the promptings of affection . Ever since Sarah Bernhardt 's great success in Fedora , Monsieur Sardou had selected her as his favorite interpreter , and it as at this time that she produced Theodora and La Tosca , both of which were written for her by Monsieur Sardou . After she left the theatre of the Porte Saint-Martin , Sarah Bernhardt , who was still desirous of possessing a theatre of her own , undertook the management of the Renaissance . During the interregnum , which lasted nearly a year , she made various tours in Europe and elsewhere , in the course of which she travelled nearly round the world . At the Renaissance Sarah Bernhardt appeared in a great variety of parts . La Dame aux Camelias and Phedre , together with Dumas 's La Femme de Claude and Monsieur Lemaitre 's Les Rois , were plays in which the public were never tired of seeing her . Monsieur Sardou wrote for her a new historical drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medee . Sarah Bernhardt extended the hospitality of the Renaissance to the Italian actress Duse and her troupe , it being an attraction to the public to see the latter in the Dame mix Cam.elias , while Sarah Bernhardt in her turn borrowed Magda from Duse 's repertoire . A taste for novelty and for foreign art made her also interest herself in a remarkable and interesting work by an Italian poet , Signor d'Annunzio ; it was , however , only a partial success , in spite of its own merits and her fine interpretation . But Sarah Bernhardt 's greatest successes were yet to come in the poetical works of Monsieur Rostand , into which she threw herself with passion , playing successively the Biblical drama La Samaritaine and that delicious come entitled La Princesse lointaine . But it was evident to Sarah Bernhardt that the theatre where she was then established , although it was one of the prettiest in Paris , was too small for her repertoire . She negotiated with the city of Paris for the possession of the Theatre municipal des Nations , which then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this she at once restored and decorated with the luxurious taste that is part of her character . In this theatre , thus transformed into one of the most elegant in the capital , Sarah Bernhardt gave some plays from her immense repertoire , and revived Octave Feuillet 's Delilah . All these , however , were but the prelude to her appearance in Hamlet , and in MonsieurRostand 's L'Aiglon , in both of which she achieved a magnificent success . This success , indeed , was so great that during the intense heat of last July , when all the fashionable theatres , such as the Varietes and others , were closed , or were kept open only as a matter of form with the smallest ' possible receipts , the Theatre de Sarah Bernhardt was every evening the scene of dispute for places , the number of them being too few to satisfy public curiosity . II It is impossible not to feel surprise at the spectacle of all that this distinguished actress has accomplished in many and different directions . This is the more remarkable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although it has now become robust , its present improvement is apparently due to the force of will power , which in an energetic nature has triumphed over physical weakness . Even if we limit our consideration to such matters as concern the general public , we find Sarah Bernhardt pursuing occupations which would sufficiently occupy a robust man ? and this aside from her artistic creations , which are continually renewed . As manager of a theatre , she permits no one but herself to select the plays in which she appears , nor does she resign  | to others the task of putting them upon the stage . The restoration of her new theatre , which is the only one in Paris where the decorations are purely in the Italian style , is according to her designs . She directs the decorators and costumers with perfect taste ; she herself chooses the draperies and the accessories . In matters such as these money is of no consequence to her ; she may be said to throw it out of the window to see it re-enter by the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , she thought it would be desirable to order the expensive uniforms required in the play from Vienna . Upon their arrival she did not consider them sufficiently well made . She sent them to a shop , therefore , and ordered others to be made in Paris . These prodigalities have been the means of securing for her theatre the well-deserved reputation of presenting a mise en scene which at once is the most complete , the most artistic , and the most beautiful . The care of this mise en scene , which in our day has become an essential , is kept by Sarah Bernhardt entirely in her own hands during her foreign tours ; and on that account she carries with her entire warehouses of supplies . This does not prevent her being an adventurous traveller with much curiosity , nor does it hinder her from exploring in the character of a tourist the country to which she comes as an actress . She is everywhere welcome , and the relations that she establishes with illustrious persons often develop into permanent friendships . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a crocodile , at another a deer , the spoils from which are added to the collections at her hotel on the Boulevard Periere , which is full of souvenirs , of works of art , and of rare books . She has even been successful in displaying to her friends some live pumas which she brought from America , and has had the audacity to keep in her court-yard . It is well known that Sarah Bernhardt was married to the distinguished artist - Monsieur Damala , since dead . She lives in a very simple manner , having with her her son , who is the object of her passionate devotion . The house is always hospitable , and is frequented by her chosen and faithful friends . On certain days of  | the week they breakfast there , but the actress invariably dines in her loge at the theatre . It is here that Sarah Bernhardt employs herself with her pen and with her modelling tools . Occasionally , and especially on her return from her first visit to America , she has displayed a contentious spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is but a faded memory , in common with the foolish and stupid stories with which an attempt has been made to surround Sarah Bernhardt 's early life . She has written her Dlemoires , which are of the utmost interest . She has published her impressions of a balloon voyage , in an exquisite little volume of most graceful fancy . She has produced her own drama L'Arca at the Odeon , and she has published in the Globe a criticism of the Salon de Peinture , which is remarkably adequate . Sarah Bernhardt is also an accomplished sculptor . For twenty years she has exhibited in the Paris salons , both pictures and sculptures , busts of bronze and marble , and portraits remarkable for their bold simplicity . An extremely lifelike bust of Monsieur Sardou is now in Sarah Bernhardt 's studio , and her work is also represented at the Exposition . Some years ago she purchased an old ruined fortress in the island of BelleIsle , which she transformed into a summer dwelling . The fish , the corals , the sea-weed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with a supply of original ideas and novel conceptions ; and it is her recreation to make use of these in creating objects of all kinds , each one of winch is a work of art . Everything , in short , serves as an outlet for her prodigious activity . III It is a proof of the genius which is universally accorded to Sarah Bernhardt that her manner has undergone a constant modification corresponding to the development in her own conception of dramatic art , which has become increasingly more elevated and comprehensive . In her youth she was a very pretty woman with a fair complexion and a charming countenance , at once sweet and expressive ; she possesses that musical voice which has been called la voix ( For , and which a poet , in speaking of her , once described as " une voix blonde . " Her physical advantages are all made subservient to her ends . She acts , as it is the fashion to say , with all the forces of her being , but her gifts , which were very evenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as great in tragedy as in comedy ; or , to speak more exactly , she ignores those limitations of genius to which custom and precedent confine the artists of our day ? limitations which only result in an excessive restriction of talent from over-specialization . Sarah Bernhardt , then , is by nature an interpreter of the French classics , and in particular of the works of Racine . The phrase " psychological stage " is modern , but the conception is very old . Racine 's dramatic art is limited in incident , and is satisfied with very simple situations , but it excels all others in its marvellous analysis of the emotions , and of the struggles to which they give rise in the human soul . Sarah Bernhardt 's genius , in my opinion , found the essentials of its evolution in the study of this particular author 's dramatic art . At the beginning of her career she was a comedian , led thereto by her natural gifts , by which , however , she was , as always happens in such eases , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress , possessing psychological insight in the highest degree , and manifesting it in complete detail , at the same time that she depicted sentiment and passion in all their delicacy or violence , and invariably sustained the character of the heroine , or of the hero , whom she represented . I say hero , as well as heroine , because of late years Sarah Bernhardt has taken pleasure in acting men 's parts . They afford her an opportunity , not to be found elsewhere , of satisfying her desire for psychological study . The parts of Lorenzacchio , of Hamlet , and of the Due de Reichstadt are complex in their nature and very different in character ; nevertheless they have one trait in common ? that of dissimulation of thoughts , which are not , however , forgotten for an hour . Audacity , vengeance , ambition , vacillation ? what a variety of emotion is to be found in these minds ! The genius of their interpreter furnishes her with a full comprehension of their emotions , and displays  | itself by enabling her to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all penetrated , analyzed , and expressed . She lays bare the essential truths of life . Her acting is the demonstration of the soul , and she surrounds it always with her own peculiar gift ? romantic color . Her impersonations are thus rendered entire and complete , whilst they are enveloped in an atmosphere of poetry . Sarah Bernhardt possesses in the highest degree the endowment of romance , and it is to this gift that she is in great measure indebted for another attribute , which she has developed and intensified by art , the faculty of pose . For it is required of an actress that , in addition to all else that she achieves , she must interpret both painting and sculpture . And Sarah Bernhardt , when she appears before us as Hamlet , calls Delacroix to our minds . These exquisite effects , where general movement , particular gesture , and definite word are all in perfect harmony , are attained by Sarah Bernhardt through her wonderful pliancy of form . When she first played a man 's part in Le Passant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in spite of this , when she appeared as Zavietto her disguise was at once revealed , and her acting occasioned that peculiar amusement which arises from the detection of a woman wearing the costume of a man and displaying in it a laughable degree of awkwardness and embarrassment . In her later parts , on the contrary , Sarah Bernhardt conveys the most dignified and noble impression of being in reality the man whom she impersonates . Her ease is extraordinary . For a long time before appearing as Lorenzacchio or as Hamlet she accustomed herself to her costume by wearing it in her own house , thus adapting to it her gestures and familiar movements . It was an amusement of a very piquant character to hear the Prince of Denmark allude during breakfast to the latest incidents of Parisian life . But custom , art , and expression are not in themselves sufficient for the attainment of plastic beauty and appropriateness of gesture ; they must be accompanied by a movement of the mind acting in unison with a group of especially harmonized bodily motions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowment . She gives evidence of it even in involuntary action . I was one day speaking of her to Pavissier , the cultivated and artistic manager of the Comedie Francaise , and he remarked : " I have never seen anything more beautiful than one occasion upon which Sarah Bernhardt , who was then in ill health , fainted upon the stage in the costume of Phedre , and MounetSully , distressed at the illness of his colleague , to whom he was much attached , carried her into her loge , he himself being attired in the costume of Hippolyte . No painter or sculptor ever composed such a group . Sarah Bernhardt remained a tragedienne even when unconscious . " I ventured to make a little sketch of this anecdote , which the great actress herself confirmed . It would be easy to spend a long time upon the discussion of what Sarah Bernhardt owes to her artistic education ; to the character of her intelligence , which is open to impressions from all sides ; to her labors in sculpture and in painting , which have developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fortune which has enabled her to be the interpreter of the whole range of modern , classic , and romantic drama , a privilege which she owes to the versatility of her talent : not any of these , however , is of as much value to her as the power that belongs to her of the exteriorization of all beauty by which she herself has been touched or impressed . In this lies the genius of her dramatic art . IV Nothing can be more regular than the life of Monsieur Constant Coquelin ? or Coquelin ( tine , as he is called , in order to distinguish him from his brother , who is also an actor , and who , like himself , is an associate of the Comedic Francaise . Monsieur Coquelin 's life is that of a hard-working bourgeois ; and I use the word bourgeois deliberately as a eulogistic term , opposed to the absurd idea which regards all actors as a bohemian and disorderly class . Monsieur Coquelin is a self-made man . He is the son of a baker at Boulogne-sur-Mer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are in France a number of families in which the theatrical profession is hereditary , and who on that ac- count are called les enfants de la balle ; with Coquelin , however , the vocation was intensely individual and spontaneous . It led him to Paris , to the Conservatoire , where he entered a class instructed by Regnair , who was a perfect master and an accomplished actor , and for whom Coquelin always entertained the deepest respect . In spite of his natural gifts , the most essential of which is an admirable voice , Coquelin obtained only the second prize in comedy : and this , we may observe in passing , shows how large a part chance plays in the competitive examinations in the Concoars , and what uncertainty is connected with them . Upon being engaged , however , at the Comedie Frangaise , he required only four years to enter the Societariat . It was in the part of Figaro that he attained the first rank , and became ? although the expression is a trifle absurd when applied to a man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Regnair 's roles , particularly in those which belong to the classic repertoire in comedy , and which are known as les grands manteaux , and soon became , in the opinion of the public , a great authority even in the sacred precincts of Moliere . As an actor of independence , however , he did not achieve this important place without encountering difficulties . A period of misunderstandings and reconciliations was followed at last by a definite rupture , which , however , I will not call final , for it is not impossible that Coquelin may , at some not very distant date , return to the theatre where nearly the whole of his career has been passed , and where he achieved his reputation . Coquelin made numerous foreign tours while attached to the Comedie Frangaise , and has done so still more since his departure from it gave him more liberty of action . Those which he made in America have not been forgotten there . He has travelled allover Europe on different occasions , stopping at all the capitals in England , Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he acted before the Sultan , and in Egypt . Success has everywhere attended him . His powerful energy has not been entirely absorbed by his studies of the innumerable roles in which he plays ? although they are always very conscientious ? nor by the heavy labors of his foreign tours , in which he always acts as director if not as impresario . He has devoted a great deal of time and pains to the formation of a choice collection of paintings , from the stand-point of a distinguished amateur . IIe has also written some remarkable essays , in which he has displayed scholarly and original criticism . In connection with these he has spoken in public on certain contemporary poets , such as Sully-Prudhomme and Manuel ; and he has made a special study of certain great parts in Moliere 's dramas , such as Tartuffe , Alceste , and Arnolphe , from his own point of view , which is not always in accordance with the traditional one . IIe is wholly devoted to his art , and equally devoted to the development of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? a dignity of which he himself affords a constant example ; and he defends the stage with ardor against unjust attacks . It was in recognition of his attitude in this respect that his colleagues , quite recently and only a short time after he had undertaken the management of the Porte Saint-Martin , chose him to preside over their powerful association . The fact that he thus took possession of a theatre in Paris , where he himself acted , together with his son , who is an excellent artist , involved Coquelin in a lawsuit with the Comedie Frangaise , a lawsuit in which the most delicate questions were involved . Monsieur Waldeck-Rousseau was his adviser and his advocate . In another affair , of less gravity ( concerning a difficulty with an impresario ) , Coquelin appeared himself before the court and pleaded his own cause in the happiest manner . He enjoys the active side of public life , and there is no great event which does not interest him , or to which he can be indifferent . He is a stanch and thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known that he enjoyed a warm friendship with Gambetta , and was a constant guest at the breakfasts at the Presidency . Gambetta loved the theatre passionately , and especially the Comedie Frangaise , where the private box reserved for him was rarely left unoccupied . There is a touch of malice in the comparison which is sometimes made between this friendship and that of Napoleon for Tal- ma , for a jest at the expense of France is always popular ; it is said that the great public orator did not disdain to consult the great comedian upon the effects that he wished to produce in the tribune . At all events it is known to me that this friendship was mutual and sincere , and that the great actor displayed no lack of dignity in forming it . Perhaps if Gambetta had lived he might have drawn Coquelin into politics . I should have regretted this for his own sake . I have suffered from the like myself , and I know by experience that of all the comedy and tragedy enacted by men , that presented on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been more than five or six years at the Comedie Francaise when it became evident that his talent had reached full maturity , and that the artist was in complete possession of a finished technique . This result had been attained almost entirely in classic parts , such as the valets and other comic characters of Moliere , the so-called roles a manteaux . But a process of evolution had gone on in Coquelin 's own mind , which made itself felt in the ultimate aims of his professional life . His mind is naturally a serious one , and he considered that to laugh or to create laughter was not the highest end of man . His keen susceptibility to emotion attracted him towards the contest between passion and duty , a contest which constitutes the whole of life , and of which the theatre presents the reflection created by art . IIe wished to represent upon the stage a more varied range of sentiments and ideas , and to devote himself to the study of characters more complex than those to which he had hitherto given expression and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he turned his thoughts in the direction of tragedy , and in so doing defied nature , which has not gifted him with the physique of a Mounet-Sully . But it is true that he very soon aspired to play parts involving mixed feelings , where emotion and tears mingled with mirth and fancy . During the period in which his mind was undergoing this transition , Coquelin 's literary taste , which is eclectic , was attracted towards the highest order of romantic poets by the remembrance of the great actors who have interpreted them . Thus it happened that the Comedie Francaise beheld him pass from classic to modern parts , that is , from purely comic characters to those of a semi-heroic nature , and by this transition he attained to the interpretation of the great social works of Dumas in the character of the Duc de Septmonts , which was , for him , an entirely new development . IIe has utilized the greater liberty afforded him by his occupation of the Porte Saint-Martin to advance in the direction towards which he has been so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been , an actor who remained purely comic in some parts , as , for instance , in the nose of Cyrano , or the stammering of Latustiere in Thermidor , but who in simple and popular characters of a soldierly caste , such as Jean Bart , Du Gueselin , or La Tulipe , as well as in the portrayal of souls of such simplicity as the forcat Jean Valjean , was the impersonator of emotion and tears arising from the interpretation of heroism , of tenderness , and of goodness . Certainly , even those persons who , by reason of a commonplace order of mind , appear to consider that Coquelin , having attained perfection in one style of acting , should remain forever restricted to it , can not deny that in him the power of depicting emotion is fully equal to the gift of exciting mirth . VI Madame Sarah Bernhardt and Monsieur Coquelin are to-day the most distinguished of modern actors , and by the variety of their talents they have become the most finished representatives of the French stage . Their artistic education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A certain romantic passion in the nature of one , and a certain concentration in the nature of the other , have seemed to be occasion of revolt against the restraints of classic tradition . By different paths they have reached the same end . They have introduced upon the stage the greatest form of human truth which it is possible to present there : truth appearing in varied forms of expression , as it does in life itself , where poetry , imagination , and reality , have their time and place .  |
