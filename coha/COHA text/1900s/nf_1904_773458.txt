txt 2G0 ANTHItOi'OLOUI geology . It seems plain how the rudiments of these sciences began from the evidence of men 's senses . Children living unschooled in some wild woodland would take it as a matter of course that the earth is a circular floor , more or less uneven , arched over with a dome or firmament springing from the horizon . Thus the natural and primitive notion of the world is that it is like a round dish with a cover . Rude tribes in many countries are found thinking so , and working out the idea so as to account for such phenomena as rain , which is water from above dripping in through holes in the sky-roof . This firmament is studded with stars , and is a few miles off . There is nothing to suggest to the savage that the sun should be enormously more distant than the cloud it seems to plunge into . The sun seems to go down in the west into the sea , or through an opening in the horizon , and to rise in like manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the minds of the first rude astronomers the belief in an under-world or infernal region , through which the sun travels in the night , and which to many a nation has seemed also the abode of departed souls , when after their bright day of life they sink like the sun into the night of death . The sun and moon move as living gods in the heaven , or at least are drawn or driven by such celestial powers , while the presence of living beings in the sky seems peculiarly manifest in eclipses , when invisible monsters seize or swallow the sun and moon . All this is very natural , so natural indeed that more correct astronomy has not yet rooted it out of Europe . Not many years ago a schoolmaster who ventured to lecture on astronomy in the west of England roused the displeasure of the country folk , that this young man should tell them the world was round and went about , when they had lived on it all their lives and knew it was flat and stood still . One part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have held its own ever since , was the measurement of time by the sun , moon , and stars . The day and the month fix themselves at once . In a less exact way the seasons of the year , such as the rainy season , or the icy season , or the growing season , furnish a means of reckoning , as where a savage tells of his father 's death having been three rains or three winters ago . Rude tribes , who observe the stars to find their way by , notice also that the rising and setting of particular stars or constellations mark the seasons . Thus the // natives of South Australia call the constellation Lyra the Loanbird , for they notice that when it sets with the sun , the season for getting loan-birds ' eggs has begun . It stands to reason that the great facts of the year 's course , the change of the sun 's height at noon , and the lengthening and shortening of the days , would be noticed , so that even among people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there exists in a loose way the notion of the year . Within the year , too , the successive moons or months come to be arranged with some regularity , as where the 0 jibwas reckoned in order the wild-rice moon , the leaves-falling moon , the ice-moon , the snow-shoes moon , and so forth . But such lunar months have to be got into the year as they best may . Indeed what distinguishes the uncivilized calendar , is that though days , months , and years are known , the days are not yet fitted regularly into the months , nor is it settled how many months , much less how many days , the year is to consist of . When we look from this to the astronomy of the ancient cultured nations , we find great progress made in observing and calculating . Yet the astronomer-priests who for ages watched and recorded the aspect of the heavens , had not yet cut themselves free from the ideas of their barbarian forefathers as to what the world as a whole was like . In the Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun-god through the western gate , and travel with him among the fields and rivers of the under-world , and the Assyrian records also tell of the regions below , where Ishtar descends into the dark abode of fluttering ghosts , the house men enter but can not depart from . Yet the Egyptians who held to this primitive astronomy had set the Great Pyramid by the cardinal points with remarkable exactness . In reckoning the year , they not only added to the 12 solar months of 30 days 5 intercalary days to make 365 , but becoming aware that even this was not accurate , they recorded its variation till it should come round in a cycle of 1,461 years , as determined by the rising of Sirius . Even more advanced was the astronomy of the Chaldxans , with its records of eclipses extending over 2,000 years . In the astronomy of barbarians the five planets Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn , are not thought much of in comparison with the Sun and Moon . But among the Chaldaians all the seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , starting the ideas of the sacred number seven , which thence pervaded the mystical philosophy of the ancients . It may have been among the Babylonian astronomers that the study of the motions of the planets led to the theory that they were carried round on seven crystal spheres ; to this day people talk of being " in the seventh heaven . " The next and great step in astronomy was when the long-treasured knowledge of Babylon and Egypt was taken up by the Greeks , to be carried on by the exact methods of the geometer . The Greek astronomers were familiar with the idea of the earth being a sphere ; they calculated its circumference , and usually taking it as the centre of the universe , they measured the apparent movements of the heavenly bodies . This system , in its most perfect form known as the Ptolemaic , held its place into the middle ages , when it came into rivalry with the Copernican system of a central sun round which revolve the earth and other planets . How this became in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how man was at last stripped of the fond conceit that his little planet was the centre of all things , need not be retold here . Geography is a practical kind of knowledge in which the rudest tribes are well skilled , so far as it consists in the lie of their own land , the course of the streams , the passes over the mountains , how many days ' marches through forest and desert to reach some distant hunting-ground , or the hillside where hard stone for hatchets is to be found However uncivilized a people may be , they name their mountains and rivers in such terms as " red hill " or " beaver brook . " Indeed the atlas contains hundreds of names of places that once had meanings in tongues which no man any longer speaks . Scientific geography begins when men come to drawing maps , an art which perhaps no savage takes to untaught , but which was known to the early civilized nations ; the oldest known map is an Egyptian plan of the gold-mines of ' Ethiopia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world is by Herodotus , who tells of Aristagoras 's bronze tablet inscribed with the circuit of the whole earth , the sea and all rivers . But to the ancients the known world was a very limited district round their own countries . It brings the growth of geography well before our minds to look at the map in Gladstone 's Juventus Mundi , // representing the world according to the Homeric poems , with its group of nations round the Mediterranean , and the great Ocean River encircling the whole . Later , in the world as known to geographers such as Strabo , the lands of men form a vast oval , reaching from the pillars of Herakles across to far India , and 1 from tropical Africa up to polar Europe . flow land and sea came to lie as they do , it is the business of geology to explain . This is among the most modern of sciences , yet its problems had long set rude men thinking . Even the Greenlanders and the South Sea Islanders have noticed the fossils inland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring that the earth was once tilted over , or that the sea rose in a great flood and covered the mountains , leaving at their very tops the remains of fishes . In the infancy of Greek science , Herodotus speculated more rightly as to how the valley of Egypt had been formed by deposits of mud from the Nile , while the shells on the mountains proved to him that the sea had once been where dry land now is . But two thousand years had to pass before these lines of thought were followed up by the modern geologists , to whom the earth is now revealing the long history of the deposit and removal , rising and sinking of its beds , and the succession of plants and animals which from remote ages have lived upon it . From this survey of the various branches of science , it is clear that their progress has been made in age after age by facts being more fully observed and more carefully reasoned on . Reasoning or logic is itself a science , but like other sciences , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask himself why or how . He worked out his conclusions by thinking and talking , untold ages before it occurred to him to lay down rules how to argue . Indeed , speech and reason work together . A language which distinguishes substantive , adjective , and verb , is already a powerful reasoning-apparatus . Men had made no mean advance toward scientific method when their language enabled them to class wood as heavy or light , and to form such propositions as , light wood floats , heavy wood sinks . The rise of reasoning into the scientific stage was chiefly due to the Greek philosophers , and Aristotle brought argument into a regular system by the method of syllogisms . Of course the simpler forms of these had always belonged to practical reasoning , and a savage , aware that red-hot coals burn flesh , would not thank a // logician for explaining to him that in consequence of this principle a particular redhot coal will burn his fingers . It must not be supposed that the introduction of logic as a science had the effect of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting practically to work on exact reasoning , especially in mathematics , that the Greeks brought on a general advance in knowledge . The importance of science was recognised when the famous Museum of Alexandria flourished , the type of later universities , with its great libraries , its laboratories , its zoological and botanical gardens . Hither students came by thousands to follow mathematics , chemistry , anatomy , under professors who resorted there at once to teach others and to learn themselves . Looking at the history of science for eighteen hundred years after this flourishing time , though some progress was made , it was not what might have been expected , and on the whole things went wrong . The so-called scholastic period which prevailed in Europe was unfavourable , partly because excessive reverence for the authority of the past fettered men 's minds , and partly because the learned successors of Aristotle had come to believe so utterly in argumentation as to fancy that the problems of the world could be dealt with by arguing about them , without increasing the stock of real knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bacon is associated as a chief expounder , brought men back to the sound old method of working experience and thought together , only now the experience was more carefully sought and observed , and thought arranged it more systematically . We who live in an age when every week shows new riches of nature 's facts , and new shapeliness in the laws that connect them , have the best of practical proof that science is now moving on a right track . The student who wishes to compare the mental habits of rude and ancient peoples with our own , may look into a subject which has now fallen into contempt from its practical uselessness , but which is most instructive in showing how the unscientific mind works . This is Magic . In the earlier days of knowledge men relied far more than we moderns do on reasoning by analogy or mere association of ideas . In getting on from what is known already to something new , analogy or reasoning by resemblance always was , as it still is , the mind 's natural guide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCIENCE 2UG put under the control of experience . When the Australians picked up the bits of broken bottles left by the European sailors the likeness of the new material to their own stone flakes at once led them to try it for teeth to their spears ; experience proved that in this case the argument from analogy held good , for the broken glass answered perfectly . So the North American Indian , in default of tobacco , finds some more or less similar plant to serve instead , such as willow-bark . The practical knowledge of nature possessed by savages is so great , that it can not have been gained by mere chance observations ; they must have been for ages constantly noticing and trying new things , to see how far their behaviour corresponded with that of things partly like them . And where the matter can be brought to practical trial by experiment , this is a thoroughly scientific method . But the rude man wants to learn and do far more difficult things  --  how to find where there is plenty of game , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the lightning , or how to hurt some one he hates , but can not safely throw a spear at . In such matters beyond his limited knowledge , he contents himself with working on resemblances or analogies of thought , which thus become the foundation of magic . On looking into the " occult sciences , " it is easy to make out in them principles which are intelligible if one can only bring one 's mind down to the childish state they belong to . Nothing shows this better than the rules of astrology , although this is far from the rudest kind of magic . According to the astrologers , a man born under the sign , Taurus is likely to have a broad brow and thick lips , and to be brutal and unfeeling , but when enraged , violent and furious . If he had been born under the sign Libra , he would have had a just and well-balanced mind . All this is because two particular groups of stars happen to have been called the bull and the balance ; the child whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these constellations is imagined to have a character resembling that of a real bull or a real pair of scales . So with the planets . He over whom Mars presides in his better aspect will be bold and fearless , but where the planet is " illdignified , " then he will be a boastful , shameless bully , ready to rob and murder . Had he but been born when Venus was in the ascendant , how different would he have been , with dimpled cheek and soft voice apt to speak of love . Practically foolish // as all this is , it is not unintelligible . There is in it a train of thought which can be followed quite easily , though it is a train of thought hardly strong enough for a joke . mauls less for a serious argument . Yet such is the magic which still pervades the barbaric world . The North American Indian , eager to kill a bear to-morrow , will hang up a rude grass image of one and shoot it , reckoning that this symbolic act will make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know in what direction they may find the wicked sorcerer who has killed their friend , will take as their omen the direction of the flames of the gravefire . The Zulu who has to buy cattle may be seen chewing a bit of wood , in order to soften the hard heart of the seller he is dealing with . The accounts of such practices would fill a volume , and they do not seem broken-down remains of old ideas , for there is no reason to suppose they ever had more sense in them than is to be plainly seen now . They may be derived from some such loose savage logic as this :  --  Things which are like one another behave in the same way  --  shooting this image of a bear is like shooting a real bear  --  therefore , if I shoot the image I shall shoot a real bear . It is true that such magical proceedings , if tested by facts , prove to be worthless . But if we wonder that nevertheless they should so prevail among mankind , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country among those who are too ignorant to test them by facts  --  the rustics who believe a neighbour 's ill-wishing has killed their cow , and who , on true savage principles , try to punish the evil-doer by putting a heart spitefully stuck full of pins up the chimney to shrivel in the smoke , that in like manner sharp pangs may pierce him and he may waste away . In another and very different way the student of science is interested in magic . Loose and illogical as man 's early reasonings may be , and slow as he may he to improve them under the check of experience , it is a law of human progress that thought tends to work itself clear . Thus even the fancies of magic have been sources of real knowledge . Few magical superstitions are more troublesome than the Chinese geomancy or rules of " wind and water , " by which a lucky site has to be chosen for building a house . Absurd as this ancient art is , its professors appear to have been the earliest to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that it seems the magician gave // the navigator his guide in exploring the world . What exact science owes to astrology is well known , how in Chaldaea the places of the stars were systematically observed and recorded for portents of battle and pestilence , and registers of lucky and unlucky days . The old magical character hung to astronomy even into modern ages , when astrologers like Tycho Brahe and Kepler. who believed that the destinies of men were foretold by the planets , helped by their observation and calculation to foretell the motions of the planets themselves . Thus man has but to go on observing and thinking , secure that in time his errors will fall away , while the truth he attains to will abide and grow . I T DOES not belong to the plan of this book to give a general account of the many faiths of mankind . The anthropologist , who has to look at the religions of nations as a main part of their life , may best become acquainted with their general principles by beginning with the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , he has to examine how and why they believe in the soul and its existence after death , the spirits who do good and evil in the world , and the greater gods who pervade , actuate , and rule the universe . Any one who learns from savages and barbarians what their belief in spiritual beings means to them , will come into view of that stage of culture where the religion of rude tribes is at the same time their philosophy , containing such explanation of themselves and the world they live in as their uneducated minds are able to receive . The idea of the soul which is held by uncultured races , and is the foundation of their religion , is not difficult to us to understand , if we can fancy ourselves in their place , ignorant of the very rudiments of science , and trying to get at the meaning of life by what the senses seem to tell . The great question that forces itself on their minds is one that we with all our knowledge can not half answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not always . A person who a few minutes ago was walking and talking , with all his senses active , goes off motionless and unconscious in a deep sleep , to wake after a while with renewed vigour . In other conditions the life ceases more entirely , when one is stunned or falls into a swoon or trance , where the beating // of the heart and breathing seem to stop , and the body , lying deadly pale and insensible , can not be awakened ; this may last for minutes or hours , or even days , and yet after all the patient revives . Barbarians are apt to say that such a one died for a while , but his soul came back again . They have great difficulty in distinguishing real death front such trances . They will talk to a corpse , try to rouse it and even feed it , and only when it becomes noisome and must be got rid of from among the living , they are at last certain that the life has gone never to return . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes and comes in sleep , trance , and death ? To the rude philosopher , the question seems to be answered by the very evidence of his senses . When the sleeper awakens from a dream , he believes he has really somehow been away , or that other people have come to him . As it is well known by experience that men 's bodies do not go on these excursions , the natural explanation is that every man 's living self or soul is his phantom or image , which can go out of his body and see and be seen itself in dreams . Even waking men in broad daylight sometimes see these human phantoms , in what are called visions or hallucinations . They are further led to believe that the soul does not die with the body , but lives on after quitting it , for although a man may be dead and buried , his phantom-figure continues to appear to the survivors in dreams and visions . That men have such unsubstantial images belonging to them is familiar in other ways to the savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or their shadows following them about , fading out of sight to reappear presently somewhere else , while sometimes for a moment he has seen their living breath as a faint cloud , vanishing though one can feel that it is still there . Here then in few words is the savage and barbaric theory of souls , where life , mind , breath , shadow , reflexion , dream , vision , come together and account for one another in some such vague confused way as satisfies the untaught reasoner . The Zulu will say that at death a man 's shadow departs from his body and becomes an ancestral ghost , and the widow will relate how her husband has come in her sleep and threatened to kill her for not taking care of his children ; or the son will describe how his father 's ghost stood before him in a dream , and the souls of the two , the living and the dead , went off together to visit some far-off kraal of their people . The Malays do not like to // wake a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body while his soul is out . The 0ji.bwas describe how one of their chiefs died , but while they were watching the body , on the third night his shadow came back into it , and he sat up and told them how he had travelled to the River of Death , but was stopped there and sent back to his people . The Nicaraguans , when questioned by the Spaniards as to their religion , said that when a man or woman dies , there comes out of their mouth something that resembles a person and does not die , but the body remains here  - -  it is not precisely the heart that goes above , but the breath that comes from their mouth and is called the life . The lower races sometimes avoid such confusion of thoughts as this , by treating the breath , the dream-ghost , and other appearances , as being separate souls . Thus , some Greenlanders reckoned man as having two souls , his shadow and his breath ; and the Fijians said that the " dark spirit " or shadow goes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or reflexion seen in water stays near where he dies . The reader may call to mind examples how such notions of the soul lasted on hardly changed in the classic world ; how in the Iliad the dead Patroklos comes to the sleeping Achilles , who tries in vain to grasp him with loving hands , but the soul like smoke flits away below the earth ; or how Ilennotimos , the seer , used to go out from his body , till at last his soul , coming back from a spirit-journey , found that his wife had burnt his corpse on the funeral pile , and that he had become a bodiless ghost . At this stage the idea of the soul was taken up by the Greek philosophers and refined into more metaphysical forms ; the life and mind were separated by dividing the soul into two , the animal and the rational soul , and the conception of the soul as of thin ethereal substance gave place to the definition of the immaterial soul , which is mind without matter . To follow the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy the student of metaphysics , but the best proof how the earlier and grosser soul-theory satisfied the uncultured mind is that to this day it remains substantially the belief of the majority of the human race . Even among the most civilized nations language still plainly shows its traces , as when we speak of a person being in an ecstasy or " out of himself " and " coming back to himself , " or when the souls of the dead are called shades ( that is , " shadows " ) or spirits or // ghosts ( that is , " breaths " ) , terms which are relics of men 's earliest theories of life . It may have occurred to some readers that the savage philosopher ought , on precisely the same grounds , to believe his horse or dog to have a soul , a phantom-likeness of its body . This is in fact what the lower races always have thought and think still , and they follow the reasoning out in a way that surprises the modern mind , though it is quite consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human soul seen in a dream is a real object , then the spear and shield it carries and the mantle over its shoulders are real objects too , and all lifeless things must have their thin flitting shadow-souls . Such are the souls of canoes and weapons and earthen pots that the Fijians fancy they see swimming down the stream pellmell into the life to come , and the ghostly funeral gifts with which the 0jibwas imagine the souls of the dead laden on their journey to the spirit-land  --  the men carrying their shadowy guns and pipes , the women their baskets and paddles , the little boys their toy bows and arrows . The funeral sacrifices , which in one shape or other are remembered or carried on still in every part of the globe , give us the clearest idea how barbaric religion takes in together the souls of men , animals , and things . In Peru , where a dead prince 's wives would hang themselves in order to continue in his service , and many of his attendants would be buried for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen those who had long been dead walking about with their sacrificed wives , and adorned with the things that were put in the grave for them . So only a few years since in Madagascar it was said that the ghost of King Radama had been seen dressed in a uniform buried with him , and mounted on one of the horses that were killed at his tomb . With such modern instances before us , we understand the ancient funeral rites of which the traces remain in the burial-mounds on our own hills , with their skeletons of attendants lying round the chief , and the bronze weapons and golden arm-rings . Classic literature abounds in passages which show how truly the modern barbarian represents the ancient ; such are the burning of Patroklos with the Trojan captives and the horses and hounds , the account of the Scythian funerals by Herodotus , and his story of Melissa 's ghost coming back shivering because the clothes had not been burnt for her // at her burial . There are districts in India where the suttee or " goodwife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile . In Europe , long after the wives and slaves ceased thus to follow their master , the warrior 's horse was still solemnly killed at his grave and buried with him . This was done as lately as 1781 at Troves , when a general named Friedrich Kasimir was buried according to the rites of the Teutonic Order ; and in England the pathetic ceremony of leading the horse in the soldier 's funeral is the last remnant of the ancient sacrifice . Other quaint relics of the old funeral customs are to be met with . There are German villages where the peasants put shoes on the feet of the corpse ( the " hell-spoon " with which the old Northmen were provided for the dread journey to the next world ) , and elsewhere a needle and thread is put in for them to mend their torn clothes , while all over Europe , at an Irish wake for instance , the dead has a piece of money put in his land to pay his way with . Mention has just been made of ancient burial-mounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , we may understand the care they take of their bodies , leaving the hut as a dwelling for the dead , or drying the corpse and setting it up on a scaffold , or burying it in a canoe or coffin , or building up a strong tomb over it , or for the ashes , if the people have taken to cremation . Prehistoric burial-places in our own country are still wonders to us for the labour they must have cost their barbaric builders . Most conspicuous are the great burialmounds of earth or cairns of stones . Some of the largest of these appear to date from the stone-age . But their use lasted on through the bronze-age into the iron-age ; and to this day in the Highlands of Scotland the memory of the old custom is so strong , that the mourners , as they may not build a cairn over the grave in the churchyard , will sometimes set up a little one where the funeral procession stops on the way . Within the old burial-mounds or barrows , there may be a Gist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a chamber of rude stones , sometimes with galleries . Many such stone structures are to be seen above ground , especially the dolmens , i.e. stone tables , formed of three or four great upright stones , with a top-stone resting on them , such as hit 's Coty House , not far from Rochester . The remains dug up show that the dolmens were tombs . // Another kind of early stone monuments are the menhirs , i.e. long stones set up singly . It happens that the Khasias of northeast India have gone on to modern times setting up such rude pillars as memorials of the dead , so that it may be reasonably guessed that those in Brittany for instance had the same purpose . Another kind of rude stone structures well known in Europe are the cromlechs , or stone circles , formed of upright stones in a ring , such as Stanton Drew , not far from Bristol . There is proof that the stone circles have often to do with burials , for they may surround a burial-mound , or have a dolmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become temples where the ghost of the buried chief or prophet is worshipped , it is likely that such stone circles should also serve as temples , as in the case of South India ai the present time , where cocks are actually sacrificed to the village deity , who is represented by the large stone in the centre of a cromlech . Rude stone monuments may be traced in a remarkable line on the map , from India across to North Africa , and up the west side of Europe ( see Fergusson 's map ) . The purpose of them all is not fully understood , especially the lines of groat stones at Carnac and Abury , and Stonehenge with its great hewn upright and cross stones . But , as has been here shown , there are facts which go far to explain the meaning of dolmens , menhirs , and cromlechs . The fanciful speculations of the old-fashioned antiquaries , such as that the dolmens were " Druid 's altars , " are giving place to sober examination such as the reader may find in Lubbock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has left such clear traces in our midst , what is supposed to become of the soul after death ? The answers are many , but they agree in this , that the ghosts must be somewhere whence they can come to visit the living , especially at night time . Some tribes say that the soul continues to haunt the hut where it died , which is accordingly deserted for it ; or it hovers near the burial-ground , which is sometimes the place of village resort , so that the souls of ancestors can look on kindly , like the old people sitting round the village green watching the youngsters at their sports ; or the ghosts flit away to some region of the dead in the deep forests or on mountaintops or far-away islands over the sea , or up on the plains above the sky , or down in the depths below the ground where the sun // descends at night . Such people as the Zulus can show the holes where one can descend by a cavern into the under-world of the dead , an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lasted on to our own day in St. Patrick 's Purgatory in Lough Dearg . By a train of fancy easy to follow , it is often held that the home . of the dead has to do with that far-west region where the sun dies at night . Islanders like the Maoris imagine the souls speeding away from the westernmost cape of New Zealand , just as on the coast of Brittany , where Cape Ilan stands out westward into the ocean , there is the " bay of souls , " the launching-place where the departed spirits sail off across the sea . Many rude tribes think the spirit-world to be the pleasant land they see in dreams , where the dead live in their spirit-villages , and there is game and fish in plenty , and the sun always shines ; but others fancy it the dim land of shadows , the cavernous under-world of night . Both ideas are familiar to us in poetry  --  one in the earthly paradise of the legends , the other in such passages as describe Odysseus ' visit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows of the dead in Purgatory wondering to see Dante there , whose fleshly body , unlike their own phantom forms , stops the sunlight and casts a shadow . Hitherto we have been speaking of the bodiless souls or ghosts of the dead , but it also agrees with their nature that they may enter into new bodies and live again on earth . In fact one of the most usual beliefs of the lower races is that the souls of dead ancestors are re-born in children , an idea which explains the fact of children having a likeness to the father 's or mother 's family . For instance , the Yoruba negroes greet a new-born child with the salute , " Thou art come ! " and then set themselves to decide what ancestral soul has returned . It does not , however , follow that the body in which the soul takes up its new abode should be human : it may enter into a bear or jackal , or fly away in a bird , or , as the Zulus think , it may pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the huts , liking the warmth of the family hearth , as they did while they were old people , and still kindly taking the food given by their grandchildren . In such simple forms there appears among the lower races the notion of transmigration which in Brahmanism and Buddhism becomes a great religious doctrine . // To return to the souls of the dead which flit to and fro as ghosts . These , wherever they dwell , are naturally believed to keep up their interest in the living , and their families hold kindly intercourse with them . Thus , in North America a Mandan woman will talk by the hour to her dead husband or child ; and a Chinese is bound to announce any family event , such as a wedding , to the spirits of his ancestors , present in their memorial tablets . The ghosts of dead kinsfolk are not only talked to but fed ; the family offer loin morsels of food at , their own meals , and hold once a year a feast of the dead , when the souls of ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food . Such offerings 10 the dead not only go on through the savage and barbaric world , hail last on into higher civilization , their traces still remaining in Europe . ' 1'lie Russian peasant , who fancies the souls of his forefathers creeping in and out behind the saints ' pictures on the little icon-shelf , puts crumbs of cake there for them . One has only to cross the Channel to see how the ancient ; feast of the dead still keeps its primitive character in the festival of All Souls , which is its modern representative ; even at the cemetery of P- , achaise they still put cakes and sweetmeats on the graves , and in Brittany the peasants that night do not forget to make up the fire and leave the fragments of the supper on the table , for the souls of the dead of the family who will come to visit , their home . All this belongs to the ancestor-worship or religion of the divine dead , which from remote antiquity has been , as it is even now , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this worship does not come only from family affection , for the ghosts of the dead are looked upon as divine beings , powerful both for good and harm . The North American Indian , who prays to the spirits of his forefathers to give him good weather or luck in hunting , if he happens to fall into the fire will believe he has neglected to make some offering to the spirits , and they have pushed him in to punish him . In Guinea . the negroes who regularly bring food and drink to the images of their dead relatives look to them for help in the trials of life , and in times of peril or distress crowds of men and women may be seen on the hill-tops or the skirts of the forest , calling in the most piteous and touching tones on the spirits of their ancestors . Such accounts help us to understand what real meaning there is in the ancestor-worship // which to a Chinese or Hindu is the first business of life , and how the pious rites for the dead ancestors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Our modern minds have rather lost the sense of this , and people often think the apotheosis of a dead Roman emperor to have been a mere act of insane pride , whereas in fact it was an idea understood by any barbarian , that at death the great chief should pass into as great a deity . That barbarians should imagine the manes or ghosts of their dead to be such active powerful beings , arises naturally from their notions of the soul ; but this requires a word of explanation . As during life the soul exercises power over the body , so after death when become a ghost it is believed to keep its activity and power . Such ghosts interfering in the affairs of the living are usually called good and evil spirits , or demons . There is no clear distinction made between ghosts and demons ; in fact , savages generally consider the demons who help or plague them to be souls of dead men . Good or evil , the man keeps after death the temper he had in mortal life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives are demon-worshippers , it was found that they had lately built a shrine of which the deity was the ghost of a British officer , a mighty hunter , whose votaries , mindful of his tastes in life , were laying on his altar offerings of cheroots and brandy . The same man will be a good spirit to his friends and an evil spirit to his enemies , and even to his own people he may be sometimes kind and sometimes cruel , as when the Zulus believe that the shades of dead warriors of their tribe are among them in battle and lead them to victory ; but if these ghostly allies are angry and turn their backs , the fight will go against them . When people like the American Indians or the African negroes believe that the air around them is swarming with invisible spirits , this is not nonsense . They mean that life is full of accidents which do not happen of themselves ; and when in their rude philosophy they say the spirits make them happen , this is finding the most distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly seen in what uncivilized men believe about disease . We have noticed already that they account for fainting or trance by supposing the soul to leave the body for a time , and here it may be added that weakness or failure of health is in the same way thought to be // caused by the soul or part of it going out . In these cases , to bring the soul back is the ordinary method of cure , as where the North American medicine-man will pretend to catch his patient 's truant soul and put it back into his head , or in Fiji a sick native has been seen lying on his back , bawling to his own soul to come back to him . But in other conditions of disease the patient 's behaviour seems rather that of a man who has got a soul in him that is not his proper soul . In any painful illness , especially when the sick- loan is tossing and shaking in fever , or writhing in convulsions on the ground , or when in delirium or delusion he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own voice , but with distorted features and strange , unearthly tones breaks into wild raving , then the explanation which naturally suggests itself is that another spirit has entered into or possessed him . Any one who watches the symptoms of a hysterical-epileptic patient , or a maniac , will see how naturally in the infancy of medical science demoniacal possession came to be the accepted theory of disease , and the exorcism or expulsion of these demons the ordinary method of treatment . It is so among savages , as when a sick Australian will believe that the angry ghost of a dead man has got into him and is gnawing his liver ; or when in a Patagonian skin hut the wizards may be seen dancing , shouting , and drumming to drive out the evil demon from a man down with fever . Such ideas were at home in ancient history , as in the well-known Egyptian memorial tablet of the time of Rameses NII . ( 12th century B. C. ) to be seen in the Paris Library , and translated in Records of the Past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ark to cure the little princess Bentaresh of the evil movement in her limbs . When he came , the demon said , " Great god who chasest demons , I am thy slave , I will go to the place whence I came . " Then they made a sacrifice for that spirit , and he went in peace , leaving the patient cured . As far back as the history of medicine reaches , we find the contest between this old spirit-theory of disease and the newer ideas of the physicians , with their diet and drugs ; and though the doctors have now taken the upper hand , yet in any nation short of the most civilized the earlier notions may still be found unchanged . When Prof. Bastian , the anthropologist , was travelling in Burma , his cook had an apoplectic fit , and the wife was doing her best to appease the offended // demon who had brought it on , by putting lithe heaps of coloured rice for him , and prayers , " Oh , ride him not ! Ah , let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rice ! All , how good that tastes ! " In countries where this theory of disease prevails , the patients ' own delusions work in with and confirm it in most striking ways . As fully persuaded as the bystanders of the reality of their demons , they will recognise them in the figures they dream of or see in their delirium , and what is more , under delusion or diseased imagination they so lose their sense of being themselves , as to talk with what they believe to be the voice of the demon within them , answering in its name , just as the sick princess did in Syria three thousand years ago . Englishmen in India and the far East often have the opportunity of being present at these strange old-world scenes , and hearing the demonvoice whisper , or squeak , or roar , out of the patient 's mouth , that he is the spirit so-and-so , and tell what he is come for ; at las-. when satisfied with what he wants , or subdued by the exorcist 's charms and threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient leaves off his frantic screams and raving , his convulsive writhing quiets down , and he sinks into an exhausted sleep , often relieved for a time when the malady is one where mental treatment is effective . Nor is it necessary to go to India or China for illustrations of this early theory of disease . In Spain the priests still go on exorcising devils out of the mouths and feet of epileptic patients , though this will probably cease in a few years , when it is known how successfully that hitherto intractable disease may be treated with potassium bromide . In other ways the notion of spirits serves to account for whatever happens . That certain unusually fierce wolves or tigers are " man-eaters " is explained by the belief that the souls of wicked men go out at night and enter into wild-beast bodies to prey on their fellow-men ; these are the man-tigers and werewolves  --  that is , " man-wolves "  --  which still live in the popular superstition of India and Russia . Again , we all know that many living people grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is thought to be caused by blood-sucking nightmares , whose dreadful visits the patient is conscious of in his sleep , and these creatures are ingeniously accounted for as demon-souls dwelling in corpses , whose blood accordingly keeps fluid long after death ; they call them vampires . It has been // suggested that primitive men gained from their ideas of souls and spirits their first clear notions of a cause of anything , and this is at any rate so far true that rude tribes do find in the doings of spirits around them a reason for every stumble over a stone , every odd sound or feeling , every time they lose their way in the woods . Thus , in the scores of good and evil chances which meet the barbarian from hour to hour , he finds work for many friendly or unfriendly spirits . Especially his own luck or fortune takes shape in a guardian spirit who belongs to him and goes about with him . This may he , as the ruffle Tasmanians have thought , a dead father 's soul lm Ling after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auneriedi warrior fasts for till he secs it in a drem ; or it may he , like the genius of the ancient Roman , a spirit horn with Liar for it companion and guardian through life . The genius of Augustus was a divine being to be prayed mid sacrificed to , but how we moderns have left behind the thoughts of the ancients , while still using their words , is curiously seen in the changed meaning with which we now talk of the genius of Handel or Turner . Not less striking is the change which has come in our thoughts about the world around us , the sky and the sea , the mountains and the forests . We have learnt to watch the operation of physical laws of gravity and heat , of growth and decomposition , and . it is only with an effort that we can get our imagination back to the remote days when men looked to an infinite multitude of spiritual beings as the causes of nature . Yet this belief arises plainly from the theory of the soul , for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human souls work human bodies . It is they who cast up the fire in the volcano , tear up the forest in the hurricane , spin the canoe round in the whirlpool , inhabit the trees and make them grow . The lower races not only talk of such nature-spirits , but deal with them in a thoroughly personal way which shows how they are modelled on human souls . Modern travellers have seen North Americans paddling their canoes past a dangerous place on the river and throwing in a bit of tobacco with a prayer to the river-spirit to let them pass . An African woodcutter who has made the first cut at a great tree has been known to take the precaution of pouring some palmoil on the ground , that the angry tree-spirit coining out may stop to lick it up , while the man runs for his life . The state of // mind to which these nature-spirits belong must have been almost as clearly remembered by the Greeks , when they could still fancy the nymphs of the lovely groves , and springs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympian gods and sitting around on the polished seats , or the dryads growing with the leafy pines and oaks , and uttering screams of pain when the woodman 's axe strikes the trunk . The Anglo-Saxon dictionary preserves the curious word woodmare for an echo ( wudu-mcer= wood-nymph ) , a record of the time when Englishmen believed , as barbarians do still , that the echo is the voice of an answering spirit ; the word mare , for spirit or demon , appears also in nightmare , the throttling dream-demon who was as real to our forefathers as he is to the natives of Australia now . Superseded by physical science , the old nature-spirits still find a home in poetry and folklore ; the Loreley is only a modernized version of the river-demon who drowns the swimmer in the whirlpool ; the healing water-spirits of the old sacred wells have only taken saints ' names , the little elves and fairies of the woods are only dim recollections of the old forest-spirits . It may surprise the readers of IIuxley 's Physiography to recognise in fairy-tales the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature . Above the commonalty of souls , demons , and nature-spirits , the religions of all tribes recognise higher spirits , or gods . Where ancestor-worship prevails , the souls of great chiefs and warriors or any celebrated persons may take this divine rank . Thus , the Mongols worship as good deities the great Genghis Khan and his princely family . The Chinese declare that Pang , who is worshipped by carpenters and builders as their patron divinity , was a famous artificer who lived long ago in the province of Shangtung , while Kwang-tae , the War-god , was a distinguished soldier who lived under the Han dynasty . The idea , of the divine ancestor may even be carried far enough to reach supreme deity , as where the Zulus , working back from ghostly ancestor to ancestor , talk of Unkulunkulu , the Old-Old-one , as the creator of the world ; or the Brazilian tribes say that Tamoi the Grandfather , the first man , dwelt among them and taught them to till the soil , at last rising to the sky , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature-spirits also the barbarian plainly perceives great gods who rule the universe , // The highest deity of the African negroes is the Sky , who gives the rain and makes the grass grow , and when they wake in the morning they thank hilt ' for opening the door to let the sun in . Thus they are at the same stage of thought as our Aryan ancestors , whose great deity Oyu , sung of in the hymns of the Veda , was at once the solid personal Shy that rains and thunders , and the Heaven-god who animates it . ' l'liis deity remains even in name in the Greek Zeus , and Latin Jupiter , the Heaven-father , both religions keeping up its double sense of sky and sky-god , belonging to the barbaric theology which could see massive life in the overarching firmament , and could explain that life by an indwelling deity , modelled on the human soul . We may best understand what was meant by the Heaven-god , if we think of him as the soul of the sky . Among all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more striking than the phrases which still recognise as a deify the living sky , as " Heaven forgive me I " " The vengeam e of I leaven will overtake him . " The rain and thunder are mostly taken as acts of the Heaven-god , as where Zeus hurls the thunderbolt and sends the showers . But some peoples have a special Rain-god , like the Khonds of Orissa , who pray to . Pidzu Penult that he will pour down the waters through his sieve upon their fields . Others have a special Thunder-god , like the Yorubas , who say it is Shango who casts down with the lightning-flash and the thunder clap his thunder-axes , which are the stone cells they dig up in the ground ; we English keep up the memory of the god Thunder or Thor in our word Thursday , which is a translation of Dies Jovis . In barbaric theology , Earth , the mother of all things , takes her place , as when the pious Ojibwa Indian digging up his medicine-plants is careful to leave an offering for greatgrandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Heaven-father and the Earth-mother are the universal parents , nor could any ceremony acknowledge them more naturally than the Chinese marriage when bride and bridegroom prostrate themselves before Heaven and Earth . The Earth-goddess is clear in classic religion , Demeter , Terra Mater , and perhaps the last trace of her worship among ourselves may be the leaving of the last handful of corn-ears standing in the field or the carrying it in triumph in the harvest-home . In modern times it is among the negroes of the Guinea coast that the clearest idea // of the Sea-god is to be found , when the native kings , praying him not to be boisterous , would have rice and cloth and bottles of rum , and even slaves , cast into the sea as sacrifices . So a Greek or Roman general , before embarking on the dangerous waves , would sacrifice a bull to Poseidon or Neptune . To men who could thus look on the sky , earth , and sea as animated , intelligent beings , the Sun , giver of light and life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night into the under-world whence he arose , has the clearest divine personality . There is a quaint simplicity in the account which not many years ago a Samoyed woman gave of her daily prayers ; at sunrise , bowing to the sun , she said , " When thou , God , risest , I too rise from my bed ! " and in the evening , " When thou , God , goest down , I too get me to rest . " As far back as ancient history reaches , the Sun-god appears , as where , in the pictures on Egyptian mummy-cases , Ra. , the Sun , is seen travelling in his boat through the upper and lower regions of the universe . Every morning those modern ancients , the Brahmans , may be seen standing on one foot with their hands held out before them and their faces turned to the east , adoring the Sun : among the oldest prayers which have come down unchanged from the old Aryan world is that which they daily repeat , " Let us meditate on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds ! " The Moon-god or goddess marks the festivals of rude forest tribes who dance by the light of the full moon . It is not uncommon for the Moon to rank above the Sun , as perhaps for astronomical reasons was the case in ancient Babylonia ; but more usually the Sun stands first , as seems to us more natural ; and commonly Sun and Moon are looked on as a pair , brother and sister , or husband and wife . It is easy to understand why at the famous temple in Syria , Sun and Moon had no images like the other gods , because they themselves were to be seen by all men . No doubt this is why of all the old nature-gods they alone still have personal obeisance done to them among us to this day ; in Germany or France one may still see the peasant take off his hat to the rising sun , and in England the new moon is saluted with a bow or curtest ' , as well as the curious practice of " turning one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moon 's proper metal . Fire , though hardly a deity of the first order , is looked // upon as a personal being , and worshipped both for the good and harm it does to man , and as minister of the greater gods . Among the Aryan nations , the first word of the Veda is the name of Agni , the Fire-god ( Latin Igreis ) , the divine priest of sacrifice ; the Parsis , representatives of the religion of ancient Persia , whose most sacred place is the temple at the burning wells of Baku , are even now t y Id ea l fire-worshippers ; among the old Greeks Hestia , the sacred hearth , was fed with fat and libations of sweet wine , and her none and worship went on in Rome in the temple of Vesta , with the eternal fire . in her sanctuary . The Wind-gods are as well known to the North American Indians and the South Sea . Islanders as they were to the Greeks , from whose religion they have come down to us so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle Zephyr . To conclude the list , the livers have seemed beings so far greater than the little spirits of the brooks , that they often , like Skaninndros and Spercheios , had temples and priests of their own ; nun swore by them , for they ' could seize and drown the perjurer in their floods , and to the Hindus still the most awful of oaths is by a divine river . above ; ill the Ganges . Such a list of gods , the vast- souls of the sky , earth ; nut sea , of the sun and moon , and the rest of the great powers of nature , each with his own divine personality , his own rational purpose and work in the world , goes far to explain polytheism , as it is found in all quarters of the globe . The explanation can not , however , be complete , because both the names and natures of many gods have become confused . A deity worshipped in several temples is apt to split up into several deities , and men go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . Among nations who have become blended by alliance or conquest , the religions also mix , and the various gods lose their distinct personality . The classical dictionary is full of examples of all this . ' . Pipe thundering sky and the rainy sky , Jupiter Tonans and Jupiter Pluvius , came to be adored like two distinct beings . The Latin Neptunus and the Greek Poseidon , put together into one because both were sea . gods , form a curious divine compound . Under the name of Mercurius , god of trade , comes in another ancient deity , the Greek Hermes , messenger of the gods , leader of the dead into the land of Hades , god of thieves and merchants , of writing and science , // who himself bears traces of having been pieced together out of yet older deities , among them the writing-god of ancient Egypt , the ibis-headed Thoth . This will give a notion of the confusion which begins in religion as soon as the worshippers cease to think of a deity by his first meaning and purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose image stands in suchand-such a temple . The wonder is not that the origin of so many ancient gods is now hard to make out , but that so many show so clearly as they do what they were at first , a divine ancestor , or a sun , or sky , or river . The gods of barbaric religion also show plainly at work , in the minds of the rude theologians , a thought destined to vast importance in higher stages of civilization . Regarding the world as the battle-ground of good and evil spirits , some religions see these ranged in two contending armies with higher good and evil gods over them , and above all the sovereign good deity and evil deity . This system of dualism , as it is called , is worked out in the contest between the powers of light and darkness , under Ormuzd and Ahriman , the good and evil spirits , in the religion of ancient Persia . In barbaric stages of religion there appears also in rude forms the system of divine government , so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the worshippers themselves there are common men , and chiefs above them , . and great rulers or kings above all , with high and low officers to do their bidding ; so among their gods they frame schemes of lower and higher ranks of deities , with above all the majesty of a supreme deity . It is not agreed everywhere which god is to have this supremacy . As has been already said , men who look to the souls of the dead as their gods may hold even the highest divinity to be such a soul , an ancestor expanded into creator and ruler of the world . Often , and naturally , the heaven-god is looked upon as supreme creator and controller of the universe . Among the nations of West Africa , some say Heaven does his will through his servants , the lesser spirits of the air , but others think him too high above to trouble himself much with earthly things . The doctrine of the Congo negroes shows a thoughtful , if not a happy , philosophy of life . They say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls of the departed , who are still active in the concerns of life , and mostly the evil spirits have the best of it ; but now and then , when they have made the world unTHE // bearable , the great Heaven rouses himself , terrifies the bad demons with his thunder , and lets fly his thunderbolts at the most obstinate ; then he goes back to rest , and lets the spirits rule as before . A more cheerful view of nature-spirits working beneath heaven is familiar to us in the Homeric court of the gods on Olympus , where Zeus the personal sky , sits enthroned above , holding sway over the lower gods of earth , air , and sea . In other countries the Sun may be looked upon as supreme , as he is among many hill-tribes of India , where he rules over the gods of the forest and the plain , the tribe-gods , and the ancestral ghosts . Or there may be , as among the native tribes of North America , a Great Spirit , who is , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he created and still controls , supreme over even such mighty nature-gods as the sun and moon . When the reader goes on to study the religion and philosophy of the ancient civilized world , he will find men 's thoughts working in these same two ways toward pantheism or monotheism , according as they conceive the whole universe as one vast body animated by one divine soul , or raise to the same divine height the one deity who reigns supreme over the rest . I t lies beyond our range to follow this argument further here . Let us now look at the chief acts of barbaric worship , which are not hard to understand when it is borne in mind that the deities they are paid to are actual human souls , or transformed human souls , or beings modelled on human souls . Even among savages , prayer is already found ; indeed , nothing could be more natural than that the worshipper should address with respectful words and entreaties for help a divine being who is perhaps his own grandfather . The prayers of barbarians have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zulus , the sacrificer says : " There is your bullock , ye spirits of our people . I pray for a healthy body that I may live comfortably , and thou so-and-so , treat me with mercy , and thou so-and-so " ( mentioning by name the dead of the family ) . The following is part of a prayer of the Khonds , when offering a human sacrifice to the Earth-goddess : " By our cattle , our flocks , our pigs , and our grain we procured a victim and offered a sacrifice . Do you now enrich us . Let our herds be so numerous that they can not be housed ; let children so abound that the care of them shall be too much for the parents , as shall be seen by their // burnt hands ; let our heads ever strike against brass pots innumerable hanging from our roofs ; let the rats form their nests of shreds of scarlet cloth and silk ; let all the kites in the country be seen in the trees of our village , from beasts being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is good to ask for . You know what is good for us . Give it to us . " These two specimens of prayers are chosen because they show how closely prayer is connected with sacrifice , how the offering is brought and the favour asked with it , just as would be done to a living chief . Barbaric sacrifices are not mere formal tokens of respect ; they are mostly food , and will be consumed by the divinity , though he , being a spirit , is apt to take only the spirit , flavour , or essence , of the viands ; or he snuffs up the steam or smoke as it ascends from the altar fire , a spiritual food of much the same thin ethereal substance which the spirit or god himself is thought to be of . It is in the higher religions that the sacrificial rite loses its grosser sense of feeding the deity , so that although the drink offering is still poured out and the bullock burnt on the altar , the act has passed into the giving up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adoration acceptable to the god . There are several ways in which the worshipper can hold personal intercourse with his deities . These , being souls or spirits , are of course to be seen at times in dreams and visions , especially by their own priests or seers , who thus get ( or pretend to get ) divine answers or oracles from them . Being a soul , the god can also enter a human body , and act and speak through it , and thus hysterical and epileptic symptoms , which we have seen to be ascribed to an evil demon possessing the patient , are looked on more favourably when the spirit is considered to be a deity come to inspire his minister and talk by his voice . The convulsions , the unearthly voice in which the possessed priest answers in the name of the deity within , and his falling into stupor when his god departs , all fit together , and in all quarters of the world the oracle-priests and diviners by familiar spirits seem really diseased in body and mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cheating their votaries with sham symptoms and cunning answers . The inspiration or breathing-in of a spirit into the body of a priest or seer appears to such people a mechanical action , like pouring // water into a jug . Also , as in the ordinary transmigration of souls , a deity is considered able to enter into the body of an animal , as when he flies from place to place in the form of a , sacred bird , or lives in the divine snake fed and worshipped among the negroes of the Slave coast . This leads on to a belief which seems still stranger to our minds . The modern Englishman wonders that a human being , however ignorant , should prostrate himself before a. stake stick in the ground or a stone picked up by the wayside , and even talk to it and offer it food ; but when the African or Hindu explains that lie believes this stock or stone to be a receptacle in Nvhieh a. divine spirit has for a time embodied itself , this shows that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rudely carved figures of ancestors which the ( ) steaks set up in their buts , to the Greek statues shaped by Phididias or Brasileles to represent the heaven-god or the sun-god , are mostly formed in the likeness of man  --  an additional proof of bow these nature-gods are modelled on human beings . When such images stand to represent gods , the worshipper may look on them as mere signs or portraits , but commonly he is led by his spirit-philosophy to treat them as temporary bodies for the deities . A Tahitian priest , when asked about his carved wooden idol , would explain that his god was not always in the image , but only now and then flew to it in the body of a sacred bird , and at times would come out of the idol and enter his own ( the priest 's ) body , to give divine oracles by his voice . This takes us back to the times when fifteen hundred years ago , Al i n uci us Felix describes the heathen gods entering into their idols and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as thin spirits into the bodies of men , to distort their limbs and drive them mad , or making their own priests rave and whirl about . Lastly , rude tribes may believe in and worship spirits without having come to build houses for them and set up tables for their food . Yet such temples and altars appear far hack in barbaric religion , and remain still with the thoroughly human character of the worship as plain as ever in them ; as when in India the image of Vishnu is washed and dressed by his attendants , and set up in the place of honour in his temple with a choice feast before him , and musicians and dancing girls to divert him . This is the more instructive to us , because we know Vishnu before his // original meaning was so spoilt , when he was a sun-god , an animating principle or soul of the sun in personal human shape , and thus a remnant of prehistoric natural philosophy . We have hitherto only looked at barbaric religion as such an o/sly system of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which now seems so essential to any religion . The philosophical side of religion has been kept apart from the moral side , not only because a clearer view may be had by looking at them separately , but because many religions of the lower races have in fact little to do with moral conduct . A native American or African may have a distinct belief in souls and other spirits as the causes of his own life and of the events of the surrounding world , and he may worship these ghostly or divine beings , gaining their favour or appeasing their anger by prayers and offerings . But though these gods may require him to do his duty towards them , it does not follow that they should concern themselves with his doing his duty to his neighbour . Among such peoples , if a man robs or murders , that is for the party wronged or his friends to avenge ; if he is stingy , treacherous , brutal , then punishment may fall on him or he may be scouted by all good people ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in fact such a man is often a great medicine-man or priest . While they hold also that the soul will continue to exist after death , flitting as a ghost or demon among the living or passing to the gloomy under-world or the shining spirit-land , they often think its condition will be rather a keeping-up of earthly character and rank , than a reward or punishment for the earthly life . If some readers find it difficult to understand such theology separate from morals , they may be reminded how , among more civilized nations , religions may drop into the same state by losing the use of the moral laws they profess ; as when a Hindu may lead the wickedest of lives , while the priests for gifts make his peace with the gods , or as in Europe brigands are notoriously devout church goers . As a rule , the faiths of the higher nations have more and better moral influence than the faiths of the ruder tribes . Yet even among savages the practical effect of religion on men 's lives begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good morals ; for the ancestor who , when living , took care that his family should do right by one another , // does not cease this kindly rule when he becomes a divine ghost powerful to favour or punish . This manes-worship does not bring in new doctrines or reforms ; indeed it is felt that nothing displeases the ancestral deity like changing the old customs he was used to . But for keeping up old-fashioned family goodness , the worship of ancestors has an influence over the many nations among whom it still prevails , front the Zulu , who believes that he must not ill-treat his brothers lest the father should come in a dream and make hint ill , to the Chinese , who lives ever inpresence of the family spirits , and fears to do wrong lest they should leave hint to fall info distress and ( lie . In the great old-world religions , where a powerful priesthood are the intellectual class , the educators and controllers of society , we find moral teaching fully recognised among the great duties of religion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Heaven-god suites the perjurer with his thunderbolt , and the Nation-god brings sickness find death on the murderer . The doctrine of the transmigration of souls is brought to bear as a moral power ; as where the I I i nd a books threaten evid-doers with being reborn in other bodies in punishment for their sins clone in this , when the wicked shall he born again blind or deformed , the scandal-monger shall have foul breath and the horse-stealer shall go hone , the cruel man shall be born as a beast of prey , the grain-stealer as a rat ; and thus , eating the fruits of past actions , men shall work out the consequences of their deeds , souls sunk in darkness being degraded to brutes , while the good rise in successive births to become gods . Even more widely spread is the doctrine that man 's life is followed by judgment after death , when evil-doers are doomed to misery , and only those who have lived righteously on earth will enter into bliss . How this doctrine prevailed in ancient Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its pictures and hieroglyphic formulas on the mummy-cases , remain to show . Thus in any museum we may still see the scene of the weighing of the soul of the deceased , and his trial by Osiris , the judge of the dead , and the forty-two assessors , while Thoth , the writing-god , stands by to enter the dread record on his tablets . In the columns of hieroglyphics are set down the crimes of which the soul must clear itself , a curious mingling of what we should call ceremonial and moral sins among them the following : " I // have not privily done evil against mankind . I have not told falsehoods in the tribunal of Truth . I have not done any wicked thing . I have not made the labouring man do more than his task daily . I have not calumniated the slave to his master . I have not murdered . I have not done fraud to men . I have not changed the measures-of the country . I have not injured the images of the gods . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not committed adultery . I have not withheld milk from the mouths of sucklings . I have not hunted wild animals in the pasturage . I have not netted sacred birds . I am pure , I am pure , I am pure ! " Thus , among the cultured old-world nations , already in the earliest historical ages theology had joined with ethics , and religion as a moral power was holding sway over society . Animism , or the theory of souls , has thus been shown as the principle out of which arose the various systems of spirits and deities , in barbaric and ancient religions , and it has been noticed also , how already among rude races such beliefs begin to act on moral conduct . We here see under their simplest aspects the two sides of religion , its philosophical and its moral side , which the reader should keep steadily in view in further study of the faiths of the world . In looking at the history of a religion , he will have to judge how far It has served these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching man how to think of himself , the world around him , the awful boundless power pervading all  --  on the other hand that of practically guiding and strengthening him in the duties of life . One question the student will often ask himself  --  how it is that faiths once mighty and earnest fall into decay and others take their place . Of course to no small extent such changes have come by conquest , as where in Persia the religion of Mohammed well nigh stamped out the old Zoroastrian faith of Cyrus and Darius . But the sword of the conqueror is only a means by which religions have been set up and put down in the world by main force , and there are causes lying deeper in men 's minds . It needs but a glance through history at the wrecks of old religions to see how they failed from within . The priests of Egypt , who once represented the most advanced knowledge of their time , came to fancy that mankind had no more to learn , and upheld their tradition against all newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left them grovelling in superstition . The priests of Greece ministered in splendid temples and had their fill of wealth and honours , but men who sought the secret of a good life found that this was not the business of the sanctuary , and turned away to the philosophers . Unless a religion can hold its place in the front of science and of morals , it may only gradually , in the course of ages , lose its place in the nation , but all the power of statecraft and all the wealth of the templeswill not save it from eventually yielding io a belief that takes in higher knowledge and teaches better life . // CHAPTER XV .

H ISTORY is no longer looked to for a record of the earliest ages of man . As the first chapter of this volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancients themselves about the still more ancient ancients . Yet it does not at all follow that ancient history has lost its value . On the contrary , there are better means than ever of confirming what is really sound in it by such evidence as that of antiquities and language , while masses of very early writings are now newly opened to the historian . It was never more necessary to have clear ideas of what tradition , poetry , and written records can teach as to the times when history begins . The early history of nations consists more or less of traditions handed down by memory from ages before writing . Our own experience does not tell us much as to what such oral tradition may be worth , for it has so fallen out of use in the civilised world , that now one knows little of what happened beyond one 's great-grandfather 's time , unless it has been written down . But writing has not yet quite overspread the globe , and there are still peoples left whose whole history is the tradition of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite lately Fad no writing , were intelligent barbarians , much given to handing down recollections of bygone days , and in one or two cases which it has been possible to test among them , it seems as though memory may really keep a historical record long and correctly . It is related by Mr. Whitmee the missionary that in the island of Rotuma there was a very old tree , under which // according to tradition , the stone seat of a famous chief had been buried ; this tree was lately blown down , and , sure enough , there was a stone seat under its roots , which must have been out of sight for centuries . In the Ellice group , the natives declared that their ancestors came from a valley in the distant island of Samoa generations before , and they preserved an old worm-eaten staff , pieced to hold it together , which in their assemblies the orator held in his hand as the sign of having the right to speak ; this staff was lately t : ken to Samoa , and proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of the valley in question had a tradition of a great party going out to . sea exploring , who never came back . Among these Polynesian traditions the best known are those handed down by the Maoris as to the peopling of New Zealand by their ancestors . They tell how , after a civil war , their forefathers migrated in canoes from Hawaiki in the far north-east ; they give the names of the builders and crews of these vessels and show the places where they landed ; they repeat , generation by generation , the names of the chiefs descended from those who carne in the canoes , by which they reckon about eighteen generations , or 400 to 500 years , since their taking possession of the islands . Notwithstanding that , as might be expected , the traditions of various districts disagree a good deal , they are admitted as the title-deeds by which the natives hold land in the right of their ancestors who landed in the canoes Shark ( Arawa ) and God's-Eye ( Data-atua ) , and it can hardly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands depended on them , are founded on fact . Yet these Maori traditions are about half made up of the wildest wonder-tales ; when the builder of one of the canoes cuts down a great tree to make the hull , on coining back to the forest next morning he finds that the tree has got up again in the night ; and when the canoe is finished and puts to sea , a certain magician is left behind , but on getting to New Zealand there he is before them on the shore , having come across the ocean on the back of a sea-monster , like Arion on his dolphin . These traditions of a modern barbarous people may give us not an unfair idea of the mixture of real memory and mythic fancy in the early history of Egypt or Greece , where it has come down by tradition from // the distant past when there was as yet no scribe to engrave on a stone tablet even the names of kings . Traditions are yet more lasting when handed down in fixed words , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even now in England some notable event may be made into a ballad and sung through the length and breadth of the land . In days before printing , the importance of the poet as historian was far greater , and many an old European chant has touches of true chronicle . The old songs of Brittany are often very true to history , as where in one there is mention of Bertrand du Guesclin 's hair being like a lion 's mane , and in another , Jeanne de Montfort ( Jeanne-la-Flamme ) going forth from Hennebont with sword and burning brand to fire the French camp , is described as putting on her suit of armour , which history elsewhere records that she really wore . But though the poet or minstrel preserves many picturesque incidents like these , he has not the historian 's conscience about facts . Eager to rouse and delight his audience , to flatter the national pride of his people and the family pride of the chieftain in whose halls he sang , the singer brought in real names and events , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or he even made his own history outright . The great German epic , the Nibelimgen Lied , begins in Burgundy , where the three kings hold court at Worms on the Rhine , their sister is the lovely Kriemhilt , whose husband Sifrit is treacherously slain at the well by Hagen 's spear ; afterwards she marries Attila the Hun-king , and the tale of blood , ending with her vengeance and death , leaves Attila and Theodoric of Verona ( Etzel and Dietrich von Bern ) weeping together over the slaughter of their men . Here are places and personages historical enough to make a poem history , if history could be made by such means ; but the reader of Gibbon . knows that Attila really died two years before Theodoric was born . In fact the poem is a late version of a story preserved in an earlier shape in Scandinavia as the saga of the Volsungs ; the court at Worms , and the tournament , and the rest of the historic names and local circumstances , are worked in to give poetic substance and colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle ages , when the chronicles were there to convict them , how are we to tell fact from fiction in the poems of ages where the check of history is // wanting ? The Iliad and the Odyssey may contain many memories of real men and their deeds , an Agamemnon may have reigned in Mykenai , there may have been a real siege of Troy , perhaps round the very mound where Schliemann has dug out the golden cups and necklace . But it is too hard a task to sift out historic truth in Ilaitn'r , where natural events are as hopelessly mixed up with miracles as in the Maori legends . It is too hard to judge how far chronicles of old nations are impartially preserved by a hard whose rule it is ( as Mr. Gladstone points out in his Primer of Homer ) that no considerable Greek chieftain is ever slain in fair light , by a Trojan . Were nothing to be had out of ancient poetry except , distorted memories of historical events , the auathrepologist might be wise to set it aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view , it is one of his most perfect and exact sotarecs of knowledge . Although what the poet relates may be fiction , what he mentions is apt to he history . In the names of nations and countries and cities , he is unconsciously piautraying for its the world and its inhabitants as they were in his liege . The catalogue of ships and men in the second book of the Iliad is a chart and census of the Mediterranean . Homer knows of the . Egyptians , their irrigated fields and their skill in medicine , and of the ship-famed l'hu nicians and their purple stuffs . The name of Padmos belongs to the 1'ha'nician tongue , and signifies the " Eastern , " while the " seven-gated " Thebes built by his people shows that they had that reverence for the mystic number seven , which has its origin in the worship of the seven planets in Babylon . The poet can hardly have thought , when he told his wonder-tales with the circumstances of the actual world around him , how future ages would prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinging under the belly of the great ram , or sailing to the land of 11:ades to the weak shades of the dead , is mere myth . Yet the description of Polyphemos is one of the few ancient pictures of the manners of low barbarians , and the visit to Ilades is a chapter of old Greek religion , recording what men thought of the dull ghost-life beyond the tomb . So it is with the descriptions of life and manners . Ntusilma , the king 's daughter , drives the wain with the pair of mules down to the river 's mouth to carry the clothes to be washed . Odysseus walks through the streets of the seafaring Phaiahians , // wondering at the haven and the mighty walls and bastions , till he crosses the bronze threshold of the palace of Alkinoos , and entering , clasps the knees of Queen Arete ; then he crouches on the hearthstone in the ashes , till the king , mindful of Zeus the Thunderer standing near to care for the suppliant , takes the guest by the hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering seat . Thus following the romantic fortunes of the many-wiled Odysseus , we see as in the scenes of a dissolvingview how the heroes of old days went spear in hand with their swift dogs at their heel , how at the house-door they threw aside their garments to go into the bath-chamber , and came forth anointed with oil to the feast where with no such refinements as plates or knives they ate their fill of roast meat and cakes of bread ; how they diverted themselves with throwing quoits on the smooth turf , or lounged on outspread hides in the sunshine playing merells ; how in solemn rites they poured the libations of dark wine and burned the meat in sacrifice , with prayers for what their hearts desired , yet knowing all the while that the gods would , as they listed , this grant and that deny . All this is not only history , but history of the finest kind . Looked at by the student of culture , even the wild mixture of the natural and supernatural , so bewildering to the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious thought . The gods meet in council in the halls of cloud-gathering Zeus , to settle what shall be done with their contending armies of worshippers on the plains below . In the very fray of mortal warriors divine beings take part ; Poseidon plucks out the bronze-tipped spear from the shield of Aineias , lifts up the Trojan hero and bears him away unharmed over the heads of the warriors ; even the goddesses set on one another like mortal shrews , when Here tears away the bow and quiver of Artemis , and with scornful laughter boxes her ears with them till the virgin huntress goes off in tears , leaving her bow behind . It would be wrong to think that all this seemed mere make-believe and poetic orna- , ment to the men who first listened to the wondrous rhapsodies . They were in the changing state of religion described in the chapter which precedes this , when the spiritual beings , which to their ruder forefathers had served as personal causes of nature and events , were passing away from their first clearness , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // fering with men 's lives . Contrasting such a state of thought with that of the present day will help us to realize one of the greatest events in all history , the change of men 's minds from the mythological temper to the historical temper . This change did not happen all at once , but has for many ages been gradually coming about . There is hardly a more instructive chapter in Grote 's History of Greece , than that in which he describes the philosophic age , when the Greeks were beginning to notice with perplexity and pain that the Homeric poems , become to them a sacred book , agreed but ill with their own experience of life , - so that they asked themselves , can the world have really so changed since the days when non sat at table with the gods ? Much of what is called ancient history has to be looked at in this way . Historical criticism , that is , judgment , is practised not for the purpose of disbelieving but of believing . Its object is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of what he says may be reasonably taken as true . Thus a modern reader may have a sounder opinion about early Roman history than the Romans themselves had in the time of Livy and Cicero . We see more plainly than they , that the name of Home is less likely to have been given from a man called Romulus , than that the name of Romulus was invented to account : for the city being called Bono . To modern minds , the whole famous story of the wolf-fostermother of Romulus and Remus collapses when it is known to be only a version of the same old wonder-tale told by Herodotus as the story of the birth of Cyrus . Yet here again may be seen the indirect value of history even where its events are most questionable . Though there may never have been any such person as Romulus , the legend of the tracing of the city walls by his bronze plough-share is a true record of the ceremony with which cities were anciently founded . Even later history , where the historian had written records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Suppose a class reading the 35th book of Livy . Such matters as Hannibal 's oath , and the preparations for war with Antiochus , are taken without question as good history . But when it comes to the story that about this time an ox belonging to one of the consuls uttered the awful words " Roma , cave tibi ! " there is a laugh . Here it is not enough for the form-master simply to pass the story by as Livy 's nonsense . He has to admit that the historian // probably took it from the official record of prodigies , so that at any rate it is good historical evidence that in ancient Rome men not only believed that an ox might speak , but that its so doing would be a divine portent , and notions of this kind had so become part of the national religion and government , that the augurs took care a regular supply of such omens should be forthcoming to guide the rulers of the state , or at least to enable them to impose upon the multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight most silly and false , may be solid facts in the history of civilisation . It is plain that the compositions which serve as records of old-world life need not have been intended as history . If only the genuine words and thoughts of the ancients about anything have been handed down , it is for the moderns to extract history from them . Thus the Sanskrit hymns collected in the Veda serve as a record of the daily life of the early Aryans who chanted them . For when a hymn to the wind gods brings them in as driving in chariots with strong fellocs and well-fashioned reins and cracking whips , then it is plain to the modern reader that the Aryan people among whom the hymn was made drove themselves in such chariots . Where the bright gods have gold chains on their breasts for beauty , carry spears on their shoulders and daggers at their sides , this mythical fancy gives a real picture of the accoutrement of the Aryan warrior . Thus , piece by piece , this praehistoric hymn-book shows the old patriarchal Aryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastures or shut in the winter cow-stall , the ploughing of the fields and the reaping of the corn , the family ties and legal rights , the worship of the great nature-gods of sky and earth , sun and dawn , fire and water and winds , the intense belief in the shining regions of the immortal dead , the honour to the almsgiver and praise to the just man . In the sacred books of the old Persians , collected in the Avesta , have come down the long-remembered traditions of another branch of the Aryan race , who , dividing off from their Brahman kinsfolk , followed the faith of Zarathustra . The deep schism between the two religions is seen in the Zarathustrians having degraded the bright gods ( deva ) of the Brahmans into evil demons ( daeva ) . Their horror of defiling the sacred fire by burning corpses as the Brahmans ' do had already led them to expose the dead to be devoured bye // wild beasts and carrion birds , as the Parsis still do in their " towers of silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned as first and best of the good regions created by the good deity , the country called .1 ilr ! Jana vaejo , the " Aryan seed , " which afterwards the evil deity cursed with ten months ' winter ; this description of the climate looks as though the old Persians believed their early Aryan home was on the bleak slopes of Central Asia toward the sources of the Oxus and Yaxartes . Here and there among the sacred verses comes a touch of the life of these proud fierce hersmen and tillers of the soil , little like the corrupt Persian and the thrifty Parsi of modern times . Their enthusiasm for the rough work of making the earth fit for man 's abode is quaintly shown where they sing of the delight the earth feels when the husbandman drains the wet soil and waters the dry , how she brings wealth to him who tills her with the right arm and the left , with the left arm and the right : " When the corn grows , then the demons hiss ; When the shoots sprout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the demons weep ; When the thick ears come , then the demons fly . " So necessary were the fierce dogs which kept the wolf from the fold and the thief from the village , that there are solemn ordinances about them , how the dog who does not bark and is not right in his mind is to be muzzled and tied up , and what punishment is to be inflicted on the man who gives a dog bad food ; it is as sinful ( they say ) as if he had done it to a wellto-do householder . One forms a lifelike picture of the sturdy farmers who made these laws to be repeated to their children 's children and carried on to future ages . While these rough Aryans were handing on memories of the past by word of mouth ins ; their sacred Verses , more cultured nations had long since begin to write down memorials of their own times . The best way to bring to our minds what this earliest contemporary history was like , is to look at the translations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published under the directions of the Society of Biblical . Archwology . Here is to be found , for instance , Dr. Birch 's translation of the inscription recording the expeditions of Una , who was the crown-bearer to king Teta , before 2000 B.C. , and . // of the account on the sanctuary walls of Karnak , of the battle of Megiddo , where Thothmes III. , about 1500 B.C. , overcame the armies of Syria and Mesopotamia and opened the way into the interior of Asia . It is related how the king , marching from Gaza , reached the south of Megiddo on the shore of the waters of Kaner , where he pitched his tent and made a speech before his whole army : " Hasten ye , put on your helmets , for I shall rush to fight with the vile enemy in the morning ! " The watchword was passed , " Firm , firm , watch , watch , watch actively at the king 's pavilion ! " It was on the morning of the festival of the new moon that the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his army , the god Amun being the protection in his active limbs , and he prevailed over his enemies ; they fell prostrate before him , left their horses and chariots , and fled to the fort , where the garrison shut up inside pulled off their clothes to haul them up over the walls . The Egyptians slaughtered their enemies till they lay in rows like fish , and conquering entered the fort of Megiddo , where the chiefs of the land came bearing tribute , silver and gold , lapis lazuli and alabaster , vessels of wine and flocks . The lists of spoil , made with curious minuteness , include living captives 240 , hands ( cut off the dead ) 83 , mares 2,041 , fillies 191 , an ark of gold of the enemy , 892 chariots of the vile army , and so on . A. later part of the inscription commemorates the liberal endowments bestowed by the victorious king on the god Amen Ea , the fields and gardens to supply his temple , the pairs of geese to fill his lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sunset , a charge to remain forever , and so on with the loaves of bread and pots of beer for daily rations . As the king says in his inscription , he does not boast of what he has done , saying that he has done more when he has not , and so causing men to contradict him . Here we see the check of public opinion beginning to act in history . It does not really compel exact truth , it allows national victories to be exaggerated and defeats kept out of sight , but even the vainglorious scribes of Egypt would hardly venture to record events without a foundation of fact . Turning now to the inscriptions of the Babylonian-Assyrian district , we may take as an example a temple-brick of the famous city Ur of the Chaldees , now called Mugheir , which bears these words in cuneiform writing : // " To ( the god ) Ur , eldest son of Bel his king , Urukh , the powerful man , the fierce warrior , King of ( the city ) Ur , king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight built . " Sumir and Akkad , here mentioned , were the seats of the old Chaldtean civilisation . As early as the Nth century B.C. , Hammurabi overcame these nations , a great event in the change that absorbed their ancient culture and religion into the conquering Assyrian empire . in an inscription of this king of Babylon , he says , " the favour of Bel gave into my government the people of Sumir and Akkad , for them I slug out afresh the canal called by my name , the joy of men , a stream of abundant waters for the people , all its banks I restored to newness , new supporting walls I heaped up , perennial waters I provided for the people of Sumir and Akkad . " By the aid of such contemporary writings , historians are now able to check the recorded lists of ancient kings , mid to piece together something like a continuous line of dynasties in Egypt and Babylonia since the foundation of the great cities Memphis and Ur . We may notice where the records and traditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical books of the Old Testament , come in contact with ancient , history from the monuments . Israelite tradition records ( Gen. xi. , xii. ) that their ancestors had been in the Chalda'an district of 11r , and in Egypt , which is evidence of their intercourse with the two great nations of the ancient world . The mention in Exodus ( i. 11 ) of the Israelites being set to build for Pharaoh a city called Rameses , points to their oppression in Egypt having been under the Great Rameses II . of the Xl X. dynasty , apparently about 1400 B. C. , which makes a point of contact between Egyptian and Hebrew chronology . In the books of Kings there come into view later persons and events , well known in the contemporary records of other countries , as in the mention of Shishak , king of Egypt , who fought against Rehoboam and plundered the temple ( 1 K. xiv . 25 ) . It seems likely , when Herodotus ( ii . 141 ) describes the army of Sennacherib , king of Assyria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bows , that this is a version of the great disaster of Sennacherib , of which the Bible gives a different account ( 2 K. xix . ) . With Herodotus the student comes in view of the Old World // as it was known to a Greek traveller and geographer of the 5th century B. C. The Father of History , as he has been called , wrote not as a chronicler of his own nation , but with the larger view of an anthropologist to whom all knowledge of mankind was interesting The way in which modern discoveries have come in to confirm his statements , justifies us in relying on ancient historians when , like him , they are careful to distinguish mere legend or hearsay from what they have themselves enquired into . Thus Herodotus tells the strange story of the impostor who passed himself off as Smerdis , and sat on the throne of Persia till he was detected by his cropped ears , and Darius slew him . When , a few years ago , the cuneiform characters of the inscription sculptured in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it proved to be the very record set up by Darius the king in the three languages of the land , and it matches the account given by Herodotus closely enough to show what a real grasp he had of the course of events in Persia a century before his time . Yet more remarkable is the test which can be put to what Herodotus says he learnt from the priests in Egypt about their kings who reigned 2000 years before . From their dictation he wrote down the names of the pyramid-kings Cheops , Chephren , Mykerinos . In later ages critics had sometimes come to doubt whether these kings belonged to fact or fable , but when the lost meaning of the Egyptian hieroglyphics was anew interpreted by modern scholars , there stood the names recognisable as the Greek historian heard them . The best ancient history is apt to receive such confirmation from long-lost monuments . Thucydides relates ( vi . 54 ) that Peisistratos ( the younger ) dedicated two altars , from one of which the Athenians erased the inscription , but the other ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in faint letters : " this monument of his archonship Peisistratos son of Hippias set up in the enclosure of Pythian Apollo . " Professor Newton reports that this very stone with its inscription is declared to have been found in 1878 in a courtyard near the Ilissos . How lively a sense of reality such monuments give to history may be understood by the student who , fresh from his books , goes to the British Museum and sees among the ancient coins the grand head of Alexander the Great with the ram 's horns , commemorating that curious episode of his life when he was declared to be son of Zeus Ammon ; or // who notices with surprise the gold coins that prove Cymbeline , now best known in Shakspere , to have been a real British king who coined money with his name . Having thus looked at the sources of early history as belonging to the study of mankind , we need not go over the well-trodden ground of later history . I t rcn ( ains to notice myth , the stumbling block which historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be looked on as mere error and folly , but as an interesting product of the human mind . It is shah ( history , the fictitious narrative of events that , never halpl , ened . II istorians , especially in writing of early ages , Kaye coined flown the traditions of real events so mixed up wit l ( n ( ytus , that it is one of the hardest tasks of the student , to judge what 10 loll eve aril Whitt to reject . He is fortunate when he can allly the test of possihilify , and declare an event did not hal ( I ( en because he k(U)w , , enough of the course of nature to be sure it eonld not . For instance , cultured nations have learnt from seienue Ihat what appears to he a blue dome or firmament above our heads , the sky of heaven , is not really the solid vault the ancients ihongl t it was , out only thin air and watery vapour . The consequence of knowing this is that people have had to strike nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in palaces and holding courts in the skies , of men climbing or flying u i from earth into heaven , of giants heaping mountain Ossa on Pelion , to scale the cloudy heights and wage battle with the gods above . Resides this way of detecting myth by its relating what could not have taken place , there are other means of judging it . It is often I , ossil , le to satisfy oneself that some story is not really history , by knowing the causes which led to its being invented . We know how strong our own desire is to account for everything . This desire is as strong among barbarians , and accordingly they devise such explanations as satisfy their minds . But they are apt to go a stage further , and their explanations turn into the form of stories with names of places and persons , thus becoming full-made myths . Educated men do not now consider it honest to make fictitious history in this way , but people of untrained mind , in what is called the myth-making stage , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared among ourselves , have no such scruples about converting their guesses at what may have happened , into the most life-like // stories of what they say did happen . Thus , when comparative anatomy was hardly known , the finding of huge fossil bones in the ground led people to think they were the remains of huge beasts , and enormous men , or giants , who formerly lived on the earth . Modern science decides that they were right as to the beasts , which were ancient species of elephant , rhinoceros , &c.,; but wrong as to the giants , none of the great bones really belonging to any creature like man . But while the belief lasted that they were bones of giants , men 's imagination worked in making stories about these giants and their terrific doings , stories which are told still in all quarters of the globe as though they were traditions of real events . Thus the Sioux of the western prairies of North America say their land was once inhabited by great animals , bits of whose bones they still keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha-o-kah , who could stride over the largest rivers and the tallest pines , and to whom they sing and dance at their festivals . It appears that fossil bones , very likely of the mastodon , had to do with this native belief in old monstrous beasts , nor need we be surprised at the giants coming into the story , considering that so lately as the last century Dr. Cotton Mather , the Puritan divine , sent to our Royal Society an account of the discovery of such bones in New England , which he argued were remains of antediluvian giants . Another thing which in all parts of the world has set the imagination of myth-makers to work , is the fact that people live in tribes or nations , each known by a particular name , such as Ojibwa , Afghan , Frank . The easiest and favourite way of accounting for this is to suppose each tribe or nation to have had an ancestor or chief of the like name , so that his descendants or followers inherited their tribe-name from him . It really happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such an eponymic or name-ancestor arises from the makers of genealogies first inventing him out of the name of the tribe , and then treating him as a historical personage . They may now and then be caught in the act of doing this . Thus among the native race of Brazil and Paraguay , some tribes are called Tupi and others Guarani , so to account for this division , a tradition is related that two brothers named Tupi and Guarani came over the sea to Brazil , and with their children peopled the country , but a talking parrot made strife between the wives of the two // brothers , and this grew into a quarrel and separation , Tupi staying in the land , and Guarani going off with his family into the region of La Plata . Now there happens to be a means of checking this story , for Martius says that the name guarani ( meaning warrior ) was first ; given by the Jesuits to the southern Indians whom they collected in their missions , so that the tale of the two ancestor-brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myths of national ancestors were not only made in ancient times , hut are mixed up in the chronicles of Old World nations as though they were real history . The classical student knows the legends of the twin brothers Danaos and Aigyptos , ancestors of the Danaoi ( Greeks ) and /Egyptians ; and of Mellen , father of the Hellenes. , whose three sons Aiu.los , Doros , Xoulhos , were fathers of the .1'olious , I ) orians , &C.; Having looked at these two frequent kinds of myths derived from fossil bones and national names , it is worth while to notice how both come together in our own country . The History of the Britons , compiled in the 12th century by Geoffrey of Monmouth , relates that our island was in old time called Albion , and was only inhabited by a few giants ; but ljrrrin.s , a banished Trojan prince , landed with his followers and called the land Britain , after his own name , and his companions Britons . With him came a leader called ( ' orinru.v , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ' omen and Iris people Corineans , that is , Cornish . In that part the giants vsere most numerous , and one especially , named ( /Dram'jot ( elsewhere called Gogmagog ) was twelve cubits high , and could pull up an oak like a hazel wand . On a certain day , when there had been a battle and the Britons had overcome a party of giants and slain all except , this hugest monster , he and Corineus hail a wrestling-match , when Corineus caught the giant up in his arms , and running with him to the top of the cliff now called the Hoe at Plymouth , cast him over , wherefore ( says the chronicler ) the place is called " Goemagot 's leap " to this day . Quaint as this legend is , it is not hard to find the sense of it . It was the fashion to trace the origin of nations from Troy ; Brutus and Corineus were invented to account for the names of Britain and Cornwall ; Goemagot or Gogmagog is the Biblical Gog and Magog rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giants . But why the story of his having been thrown over the Hoe at Plymouth ? The // answer seems to be that this is a place where the bones of fossil animals are actually dug up , such as were looked upon as remains of giants . Even in modern times , when excavations were being made on the Hoe for the fortifications , huge jaws and teeth were found , which were at once settled by public opinion to be the remains of Gogmagog . These are examples of the myths easiest for modern civilised minds to enter into , for they are little more than inferences or guesses as to what may have actually happened , worked up with picturesque details which give them an air of reality . But to understand another kind of myths we must get our minds into a mood which is not that of scientific reasoning in the class-room , but of telling nursery tales in the twilight , or reading poetry in the woods on a summer afternoon . Former chapters have shown how , in old times and among uncultured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as poetic fancy were seriously believed . When to the rude philosopher the action of the world around him was best explained by supposing in it nature-life like human life , and divine nature-souls like human souls , then the sun seemed a personal lord climbing proudly up the sky , and descending dim and weary into the under-world at night ; the stormy sea was a fearful god ready to swallow up the rash sailor ; the beasts of the forest were half-human in thought and speech ; even the forest-trees were the bodily habitations of spirits , and the woodman , to whom the rustling of their leaves seemed voices , and their waving branches beckoning arms , hewed at their trunks with a half-guilty sense of doing murder . The world then seemed to be " such stuff as dreams aic made on " ; transformation of body and transmigration of spirit were ever going on ; a man or god might turn into a beast , a river , or a tree ; rocks might be people transformed into stones , and sticks transformed snakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are still tribes living in it , and they show what the men 's minds are like who make nature-myths . When a story-teller lives in this dreamland , any poetic fancy becomes a hint for a wondertale , and though ( one would think ) he must be aware that he is romancing , and that the adventures he relates are not quite history , yet when he is dead , and his story has been repeated by bards and priests for a few generations , then it would be disrespectful , or even sacrilegious , to question its truth . This has HISTORY AND MYTHOLOGY 80 ? happened all over the world , and the Greek myths of the great nature-gods which Nenophanes and Anaxagoras ventured to disbelieve with such ill consequences to themselves , were of much the same fabric as those of modern barbarians like the South Sea Islanders . Let us look at a few nature-myths , choosing such as most transparently show how they came to be made . The Tahitians tell tales of their sea-god Hiro , whose followers were sailing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the depths below ; then the wind-god raised a. furious storm to destroy the canoe , but the sailors cried to Hiro , till , rising to the surface , lie quelled the stone , and his votaries came safe to port . So in Monier , Poseidon the sea-god dweller in caves of ocean , sets on the winds to toss the frail bark of Odysseus among the thundering waves , till Ino conies to his rescue and bids hint strip and swim for the Phaiakian shore . Both tales are word-pictures of the stormy sea told in the language of nature-m , yth , only with different turns . The New Zealanders have a story of lllamii imprisoning the winds , all but the wild west-wind , whom he can not catch to shut into its cavern by a great stone rolled against its mouth ; all he can do is to chase it home sometimes , and then it hides in the cavern , and for a while dies away . All this is a mythic description of the weather , meaning that other winds are occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealanders had never heard of the classic myth of Aiiolus and the cave of the winds , yet how nearly they had come to the same mythic fancy , that it is from such blow-holes in the hill-sides that the winds come forth . The negros of the West Indies tell a tale of the great quarrel between Fire and Water , how the Fire came on slowly , stopped by the stream , till he called the Wind to his aid , who carried him across everything , and the great fight came off , the Pon Lieu looking on from behind a curtain of clouds . It is not likely that these negro slaves had ever heard of the twenty-first Iliad , to know how the same world-old contest of the elements is told in the great battle between the Fire-god and the Rivers , when the Winds were sent to help , and carried the fierce flames onward , and the eels and fish scuttled hither and thither as the hot breath of the blast came upon them . The beams of light darting down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's fancy in Europe // as being like the rope over the pulley of an old-fashioned drawwell , for this appearance is called in popular phrase , " the sun drawing water . " The Polynesians also see the resemblance of the rays to cords , which they say are the ropes the sun is fastened by , and they tell a myth how the sun once used to go faster , till a god set a noose at the horizon and caught him as he rose , so that he now travels bound and slowly along his daily appointed path . In English such an expression as That the sun is " swallowed up by night " is now a mere metaphor , but the idea is one which-in ancient and barbaric times people took more seriously . The Maoris have made out of it the story of the death of their divine hero Maui . You may see , they say , Maui 's ancestress , Great-Woman-Night , flashing and as it were opening and shutting out on the horizon where sea and sky come together ; Maui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but just at that moment the little flycatcher , the tiwakawalca , broke out with its merry note and awoke the Night , and she crushed Maui . That this is really a nature-myth of the setting sun dying as he plunges into the darkness , is proved by the mention of the bird , which has the peculiarity of singing at sunset . Of all the nature-myths of the world , few are so widely spread as those on this theme of night and day , where with mythic truth the devoured victims were afterwards disgorged or set free . The Zulu story-tellers describe the maw of the monster as a country where there are hills and houses and cattle and people living , and when the monster is cut open , all the creatures come out from the darkness ; with a neat touch of nature which shows that the story-teller is thinking of the dawn , the cock comes out first , crying , " kulculuku ! I see the world ! " Our English version of the old myth is the nursery tale of Little Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper end ( which German nurses have kept up with better memory ) , that when the hunter ripped up the sleeping wolf , out came the little damsel in her red satin cloak , safe and sound . Such stories are fanciful , but the fancy of the myth-maker can take yet further flights . The mythic persons as yet described have been visible objects like the sun , or at least what can be perceived by the senses and made real objects of , such as wind , or day . But when the poet is in the vein of myth-making , whatever he can express by a noun and put a verb to , becomes capable // of being treated as a person . If he can say , summer conies , sleep falls on men , hope rises , justice demands , then he can set up summer and sleep , hope and justice , in human figures , dress them , and make them walk and talk . Thus the formation of myth is helped by what Professor Max Muller has called a " disease of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole matter . We saw in the last chapter how the notion of soul or spirit helped men on to the notion of cause . When the cause of anything presents itself to the ancient mind as a kind of soul or spirit ; then the cause or spirit of summer , sleep , hope , justice , comes easily to look like a person . No one can really understand old poetry without knowing this.Homer could fancy on the field of battle the awful Ker , whose figure was shown on the shield of Achilles with blood-stained garment flung over her shoulders , as she seized some warrior wounded to the death , or dragged a corpse by the feet out of the fighting throng . This being is not merely a word turned into a reality , she is a personal cause , a spirit-reason , why one warrior is slain and not another . So far is the idea of her spread in Aryan mythology , that it appears again among the Northmen , when Odin sends to every battle the maidens who in Walhalla serve the feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heroes ; these maidens are the Valkyriur , who guide the event of victory , and choose the warriors who shall fall . Another well-known mythic group shows again how what to us moderns are but ideas expressed in words , took personal form in the minds of the ancients . In the classic books of Greece and Rome we read of the three fate-spinners , the Moirai or Pare , and their Scandinavian counterparts appear in the Edda as the three wise women whose dwelling is near the spring under the world-ash Ygdrasill , the Norns who fix the lives of men . The explanation of these three mythic beings is that they are in personal shape the Past , Present , and Future , as is shown by the names they bear , Was , Is , Shall ( Urrlhri Verdhanci , Skuld ) . Stories are always changing and losing their meanings , and from age to age new bards and tale-tellers shape the old myths into new forms to suit new hearers . Considering how stories thus grow and change , one must expect their origins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While , as we have seen , it may be often possible to make out what they came from , this // must be done cautiously . Clever writers are too apt to sit down and settle the mythic origin of any tale , as if this could be done by ingenious guessing . Even if it is nonsense and never was intended for anything else , the myth-interpreter can find a serious origin for it all the same . Thus a learned but rash mythologist declares that in our English nursery rhyme , " the cow jumped over the moon , " is a remnant of an old nature-myth , describing as a cow a cloud passing over the moon . What is really wanted in interpreting myths is something beyond simple guessing ; there must be reasons why one particular guess is more probable than any other . It would have been rash to judge that Prometheus the fire-bringer is a personification of the wooden fire-drill , were it not known as well that the Sanskrit name of this instrument is pramantha ; taken together , the correspondence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got back to the real origin of the Prometheus-legend . We may choose another example from the mythology of India , in the story of Vamana , the tiny Brahman , who , to humble the pride of King Bali , begs of him as much land as he can measure in three steps , but when the boon is granted , the little dwarf expands into the gigantic form of Vishnu , and , striding with one step across the earth , another across the air , and a third across the sky , drives Bali down into the infernal regions , where he still reigns . This most remarkable of all the Tom Thumb stories seems really a myth of the sun , rising tiny above the horizon , then swelling into majestic power and crossing the universe . For Winans , the " dwarf , " is one of the incarnations of Vishnu , and Vishnu was originally the Sun . In the hymns of the Veda the idea of his three steps is to be found before it had become a story , when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airy regions in his three strides . " Vishnu traversed ( the earth ) , thrice he put down his foot ; it was crushed under his dusty step . Three steps hence made Vishnu , unharmed preserver , upholding sacred things . " It remains to see how myths spread . Whenever a good story is told , whether real or made-up does not matter , it becomes part of the story-teller 's stock , who puts to it any new name that will suit , and often succeeds in planting it not only in popular legend , but even in history . There is a fragment by Demaratus preserved in the collection of Stobnus , where there is related with
