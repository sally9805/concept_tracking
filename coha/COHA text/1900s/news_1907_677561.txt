txt James J. Hill , President of the Great Northern Railway since its organization in 1889 , and personally the most conspicuome figure in the American railroad world , resigned to-day from the presidency of the road and was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors . He Is not to give up , at present at least , his management of the finances acid policies of the Great Northern , and will continue to perform as Chairman the duties with which he has been charged for the last eighteen years as President . His son , Louis W. Hill , has been elected President of the Great Northern , and Frank H. , who recently came to the Great Northern from the Grand Trunk Railway , was elected vice-president . These changes in the Great Northern management were announced in this statement , issued after a meeting of the Board of Directors , which Mr. 1-,11 attended : " At a meeting of the Board of Directors held here this afternoon , the ganization of the company was enlarged by the election of a Chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman , Louis W. Hill was elected President , and Frank H. First Vice President . Mr. will have I direct charge of the operating depart-1 ment , the other officers of the board remaining as at present . The company 's business has doubled ' in the past five or six years , which renders necessary the increase of the operating staff . " E. T. Nichols , Vice President of the Great Northern , said in this city last night that the action taken in St. Paul yesterday in no sense meant the retirement of Mr. Hill from the direction of Great Northern affairs . fie added that Mr. Hill 's duties as Chairman would be practically identical with the duties he has been performing In recent ears . These have had ? to do with the general direction of the road 's directly and . flt0,5el - rather than ' direy with the okertition of the property . A ' Step Toward , . Retirement.Neveitthelest , the election of Mr. Hill as Chairman of the board is believed to be a step in the direction of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , which it has been Mr. Hill 's desire to do for the last year . He has repeatedly said , however , In discussing with friends the possibility of his retirement , that he would stay with the road as long as there was ' any trouble to confront , and just at this I time , when railroad affairs are under such close scrutiny , it is not thought ' likely that he will turn over to others the task of directing the Great Northern 's affairs . The Great Northern as it stands today , one of the most important railroad systems in the country , is largely the result of the efforts which James J. Hill has devoted to the upbuilding of the Northwest . Mr. Hill , before he was President of the Great Northern , was President of the St. Paul , Minneapolis &-; Manitoba from 1883 to 1859 . For many years before he was with the St. Paul &; Pacific , which became a part of the Great Northern system . He entered the railroad service in 1865 , and has continuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later in important positions , in the railroad work of the Northwest . Mr. Hill long has been regarded as one of the most enterprising and successful railroad men identified with the upbuilding of the transportation system in the united States . Of late years he has extended his field of activity to Canada , and Is now engaged in the construction of a new line , from Winnipeg to the Pacific Coast . In his railroad undertakings in the Northwest Mr. Hill has on more than one occasion come into conflict with the plans of E. H. Harriman , and some battles royal have resulted from r efforts of these two men to carry ut their respective plans for the extension of the influence of their roads in the Northwestern States . Pelt He Had Earned a Rest . Before the Attorney General of Minnesota began suit against the Great Northern to prevent the issuance og $60,000,000 of new stock Mr. Hill 's friends thought that the successful flotation of this in- I crease in the Great Northern capital would probably mark the close of Mr. Hill 's active connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to friends in December last , said that he had made up his mind to retire ; that he was 08 years old , and felt that he had earned a rest . He meant , he said , to give up the Great Northern Presidency and to go abroad for a year , so that he could not again be drawn into active railroad affairs against his will . He added , however , tilat he would make no such announcement , because something might turn up to change his plans . That something , his friends agreed , came In the shape of the attack by the Attorney General of Minesota on the validity of the proposed new stock Issue , and the subsequent injunction proceedings which were dissolved only last week . With this difficulty out of the way , the Great Northern , along with other railroads of the country , still has to face the questions arising from the mbvement for closer control of the transportation lines by the ' Government . This is a situatiOn in which Mr. Hill 's friends would be loath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Northern . Mr. Hill , It is thought , is as little inclined to give up the task now as his friends are to have him do so .
