txt From an English source , the Sheffield correspondent of The Yorkshire Post. our Consul at Hull has taken Some striking figures as to the relative progress of the British and German production and export of iron and steel . The correspondent calls attention to the fart that England enjoys great advantages over Germany in the production of pig iron , the basis of the whole trade . The ore and coal are of about the same quality , but English coal is cheaper and the coal and iron can be assembled at lower cost . In Westphalia alone the cost of coal is higher than in the Cleveland district of England , but the cost for Sohth Wales and Scotland is put at from one-fourth to one-fifth the cost in Lorraine and Luxembourg . The result is that in the five years ending with 1904 the average price of German pig was $18 . Per ton as against $12.96 for English , or , roughly , one-half greater . For the next four years the difference was somewhat less : but was still nearly 40 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production has been much slower than that of the world 's production and still slower proportionately than the German . In the last , twenty-seven years the total production , of the world has tripled , that of Germany has quadrupled , and that of England has advanced less than one-fourth . In round numbers , the product of the world in 1880 was 20,000,000 tons , that of Germany was 3,300,000 , that of England was 8,100,000 tons . In 1901 ' the world 's product was 60,000,000 tons , that of Germany was 12,800,000. and that of England was but 9,900,000 tons . Meanwhile the proportion of manufactured products in the exports of Germany has amounted to 88 per cent. , while the proportion In English exports is but 65 per cent . Trie moral drawn from this situation by the British writer is nOtone thatwould commend itself to the protectionist . but it is extremely sensible and pertinent . He says : There is certainly nothing funda- ' mental in the ironmalting resources of Germany to enable that country to beat us , and whenever and wherever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or neutral markets , their success has been due , not to neutral favors , but to more careful technical training , more diligent attention to business opportunities , and a more highly organized system of sales than has yet been adopted by ourselves . The lesson for this country is plain and unmistakable .
