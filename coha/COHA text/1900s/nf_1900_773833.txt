txt // and pervaded by wonderful currents of electric force , and imponderable virgin matter that compass the universe with their vibrating energy . I'rof'essor Crookes says in reference to his experiments with the wonderful Crookes ' rays , that they brought him " face to face with matter in a fourth state , or condition ? a condition ai , s lien removed from the state of gas , as gas from the liquid . We had touched the border land where matter and force scem to merge into each other ? the shadowy realm between the known and the unknown . " He further adds that the greatest scientific problems of the future will find their solution in this border land and even beyond , where lay ultimate realities , subtle , far-reaching and wonderful . Have we not , lunml these in the marvelous powers , energies and agencies of electricity ? We have no evidence of loss of light or heat in the sun ; and the theory of scientists that it was fed by other worlds being drawn into its burning vortex is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the light and heat of the sun is supplied by his attracting energy as a great magnet ( hawing virgin atoms of matter into his atmosphere , thus evolving light , heat and electricity within his own photosphere , where there is no waste of energy . Every planet by this law of attraction and evolution shines with its own light measured by its own electric attracting energy , and warms itself from its solar centre and space that supplies its ever-growing strength . The power that appears upon the earth as sunlight is awakened into force within the earth 's atmosphere , by the resistance of the atmosphere and the attraction of the earth . The gaseous , the liquid , and the solid states of matter , all wait on the eleetro-magnetic elements of light and heat for their beginning and permanency of structure . It is said the dream of our ablest philosophers " that light and heat in the sun are generated by resistance to gravity , " is inOR , // terpreted by Minor to teach that resisted gravity is light and heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Light and heat , electricity thus evolved , are building forces lifting matter from space into body , and then surrendering it to cohesive affinities which is another form of electricity ... The same author says again , " The fact that chemical affinities are all under the control of electrical energy , and atoms enter into molecular unions from opposite electrical states teaches that the sources of supply are from electromagnetic currents . " Out of the dark cold void of space have been gathered the suns , and stellar systems that stud the heavens with their brilliant lights ? ever burning , never consuming ; with their electric fires undiminished through all the ages , earth gathers her electric fire and forces from the sun with its diameter of 865,000 miles of solid nucleus , as the revolving centre of the solar system , from which he sends out his radiating floods of energy to all the planets including Neptune , the outermost planet in his family of worlds . And so exhaustless is the electrical power that commands perpetual motion and wonderful velocities , that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between earth and sun move 186,000 miles ; and Mercury goes forward in his orbit 30.40 miles ; Venus 22.24 miles ; Earth 18.91 miles ; Mars 15.32 miles ; and Neptune at the distance of 2,272,325,000 miles from the sun moves three and onehalf miles . This shows the wonder-working power of the polar and equatorial electric currents of the solar system . They consist in the positive and negative or repellent currents flowing in opposite directions in space with equal strength and equal velocities . They are in stellar space the same forces that Joseph Cook calls the " coordinating forces that work back of the bioplasm arranging the growth of the whole ( animal ) body . " And of which he says , " Take out the bioplasts , you know // the power is there ; but you can not see it , you can not touch it . The coordinating forces which we know exist in the physical organism is the true body . " This weaves the network of forces through every organic form , and " presides over every generative embrace of atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well said , " to an American the question , what is electricity ? has a great national interest . " Benjamin Franklin , Joseph Henry , Edison and Tesla have been like electric lights on the mountain tops of this continent , and in America the practical applications of electricity have been so swift and extensive , its manifold transformations are peculiarly congenial to the American temperament . Electricity no longer stands apart , a mysterious force as Franklin regarded it , having no connection with light or heat . We can not now study it apart from the manifestations of light , licat , magnetism , force . As soon as we begun to measure the forces of attraction and repulsion , and the energy it makes manifest in heat , light and force , electrical knowledge took a herculean stride , and own saw clearly the transformation of mechanical work into heat , and the relation between the work of a horse in producing this transformation and the food which he eats . As soon as Faraday showed that motion could also be converted into electricity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electrical energy produced , the new electric era began . The subject of electricity took its great forward movement not from the side of the subject investigated by Franklin , but from the side of magnetism . It was the movement of a magnetized needle that led Faraday to his great discovery of induction and the conversion of motion into electricity . // Professor Trowbridge says , " We know little more of the properties of the loadstone and of permanent magnets , and of the magnetism of the earth , than was known to Count Rumford or Sir Isaac Newton , who thought that if all loadstones , the earth 's magnetism , and the permanent magnets were destroyed , that magnetism would disappear from the earth . A century ago there was no conception of the possibility of producing a magnetic condition in iron by means of a wire wrapped around the iron and connected with a voltaic cell ; for the principle of electro-magnetism was not discovered until 1819 . " IIe says further , to-day if there should be a destruction of all loadstones , permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world would only be incommoded by the substitution of observations on the sun and stars , for the observation of the ship 's compass . We could produce permanent magnets and powerful electromagnets by the use of voltaic cells . The question what is electricity , is closely allied to the question , what is magnetism ? what is light ? what is heat ? what is the perpetual motion and cosmic forces of nature ? I hold they are all one and the same , with different manifestations , offices and powers . I maintain the unity of all forces in nature , that they are all from the one original elemental force . That all the mysterious , creative , sustaining protean forces of nature is electricity in some of its forms , and are different manifestations of one fundamental power . That from electricity comes light and heat , and all material force , including attraction , cohesion and gravitation . Franklin said , " As to the magnetism which seems to be produced by electricity , my real opinion is these two powers of nature have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Franklin was mistaken ; and it now includes in electricity not only magnetism , but light , heat , force , and transformation of energy ; and needs to take but // one step more to include gravitation , and make electricity cover all the forces of nature . This I contend it should do , and that all light , heat and force in nature are electricity . The discovery made by Galvani and Volta of the galvanic battery and the voltaic pile , which were simple forms of electric machines , it was ascertained that an electric current was generated whenever two dissimilar metals connected by it wire are immersed in a liquid capable of conducting electricity . A voltaic pile in its first form consisted merely of discs of copper and zinc separated by pieces of blotting paper moistened with salt and water . " I f ' , " says Professor Trowbridge , " the handles of a silver spoon and an iron spoon are connected by a copper wire , and the bowls of the spoons immersed in a tumbler of salt and water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the copper wire , and in the water from the iron spoon to the silver spoon , and constitutes a battery sufficient to scud a signal under the Atlantic from America to England , ' But the supply of electricity now however is not obtained from batteries , but from dynamos , which supply it with the ease and abundance that gas and water may be supplied , and which give practical commercial uses to electricity . The discovery of currents of induction made by Faraday and Henry is the foundation of the action of the dynamo and of the telephone . Why two different metals immersed in a conducting fluid produce a current of electricity is not well understood , and brings forward the great problem of the connection of electrical action and molecular motion , which includes the fundamental principles of chemical action . And both chemistry and electricity are becoming a study of motion ; and the mystery of chemical and electrical action and motion constitute the difference in form and substance or appearance of all matter , producing the vapor , the fluid , // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the softness of wood and flesh . If we run the wires from a battery into ascidulated water we find that the water is broken up into its constituent elements ? the bubbles of hydrogen gas are given off at one end of the wire , and bubbles of oxygen at the other . This action is called electrolysis , and is intimately connected with molecular motion ; the electrical action having rent asunder the hydrogen molecule , and the oxygen molecule ? the bond that made the particles of water , and there is decomposition of the water , and the particles are then free to vibrate independent of each other , and form new combinations . The galvanometer has shown that electrical actions pervade all matter , and that there are electric waves in the ether of space ; it can detect slight molecular disturbances , and also reveal mysterious effects in the ether of space . It is the electrical microscope which has revealed the great world of electrical activity in which we move . The earth is a great magnet and the currents of electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other repels , and thus causes the earth to revolve round its axis . It is well said that the ancients could not have possessed dynamo machines or telephones for they knew not the art of making wire , nor the art of covering wire with cotton or silk . There is no trace of such wire in the ruins of Egypt , Greece or Rome , and it is the discovery and art of the present century . The modern dynamo is a machine that excites currents of electricity in a coil of wire passing rapidly near the poles of a magnet . The current is excited in the coil in one direction by movement near a south pole , and in the opposite direction by movement near a north pole , and a commutator directs these opposite currents through another coil in the same direction . The dynamo is a simple 8G INVISIBLE LIGHT , machine consisting of a number of coils on a revolving shaft surrounded by fixed pieces of iron , around which the currents formed in the revolving coils are made to circulate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached its highest development . Professor Trowbridge says : " We have learned that light , heat , electricity , are embraced under one head ? that of the transformations of energy . Electricity no longer stands apart , a mysterious force , as Franklin regarded it having no connection with light or heat . Before his day the knowledge of electrical phenomena was confined to the observation of the attraction of magnets , and of frictional electricity . As soon ns men abandoned theories of subtle fluids , and began to measure the forces of attraction and repusion , : Ind the equivalence between motion and the energy it makes manifest , the science of electricity took an immense stride . " Faraday 's discovery of the galvanometer and the law of magneto-induction , and 1 ax vell 's eleetro-magnetic theory of light , which gave the conception of electrical actions in the medium oI ' space , laid the foundation for the electrical science of modern times , and established the fact that the earth is a n:aguct , mid any motion of a wire on its surface will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enables one to signal nodes the sea through a cable by properly waving a coil or wire in the air . Faraday never realized the powerful effect that could be obtained when his lines of magnetic force were made to quiver with great speed . The telephone is an instrument based entirely upon his discovery of magneto-induction . The telephone into which we speak , corresponds to the electric dynamo , and the one to which we listen to the electric motor . But there is no commutator ; to and fro currents are // used ? that is an alternating current dynamo , and an alternating current motor . The electro-tonic state in the media surrounding wires carrying currents and magnets is made definite by the quivering of the magnetic lines of force . These lines stretch out from the poles of a magnet and seek the shortest passage from one pole to another . They pass from the North pole of the earth to the South pole through the atmosphere . The slightest movement of a wire anywhere on the earth 's surface , produces an electromotive force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of the earth . The oxygen of the air itself is magnetic , and more lines of force will pass through it than pass through copper . Faraday believed that all bodies are more or less magnetic , and this is the modern conception . The lines of magnetic force pass through all substances . They pass through wood , brick walls , copper , and all metals , and no substance cuts them off . The electric energy of the dynamo is not transmitted along the wire ; it is manifested in the ether of space , and in the insulating media about the wire ; so says Professor Lodge . Electricity therefore does not travel to a distant motor through the wires but through the air . The electricity of an Atlantic cable battery does not travel through the wire strands , but through the insulating sheath , which seems singular and paradoxical . Ile also says oscillations of electric waves or currents go far into the billions per second . Oscillations as rapid as ten millions a second can magnetize iron . When people imagine they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds to the earth , or from the earth to the sky , they must reflect on this oscillatory phenomenon , and consider the interval between such oscillations is less than one ten millionth of a second , and that an impression remains on the retina of the eye only // about one-sixteenth of a second . The human eye can not therefore distinguish direction in the electric spark . Light , heat and electricity are manifestations of electromagnetic waves which come to us from the sun . The waves of electricity travel with the velocity of light . The sun is a vast electric globe ; and the sun 's light is due to carbon burning in an atmosphere of oxygen . We can semi electro-magnetic waves through brick walls and detect them in neighboring rooms . We can photograph by means of waves that have passed through a brick wall , and those which have passed through opaque metallic screens , which cut oil ' entirely the light rays so considered . We can send them through blocks of wood and iron , and through the human body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in flesh . We can not detect the heat waves so far as we can detect the electric waves . The heat waves are nearer in length to the electric waves Nvhich we can detect , than the light waves . We can measure electro-magnetic waves generated by a spark , and we can measure heat waves which accompany them . Professor ' I'rowhridge says , the phenomena of electromagnetism compel us to assume the existence of a medium through which and I ) y means of'which the electrical energy is transmitted . And I hold that medium or substance is the invisible etheric atoms of space . These atoms contain all the elements of nature in invisible solution . As to those counteracting and complementary forces which we name carbon , oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen , gas and all the entities of creation , which with all their mysterious combinations constitute the varied visible things of the world ; we know about as much as Franklin knew a century and a half ago . The discussion of the wave theory in a medium , and a molecular theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms vibrate , // but with much smaller amplitude than the ether particles is of little consequence . We know there is a vibration or movement of atoms which is caused by electrical energy or force and that covers the whole question . There is among our best scientists a lack of clear distinction between electricity and magnetism , which I deem the simple phases of the same force . Ampere regarded magnets and currents as identical , and taught that " magnets are bodies traversed continually by electric currents . " Raffle , a French scientist , says , " Here are two series of facts , magnetic phenomena , and electric phenomena , separated to this day yet coming together and confounding themselves with one another . " IIe seems to adopt the thought of Ampere that " one and the same cause may produce effects differing from one another . " They are as I conceive but different effects of the same force . They are the coming and going force currents of nature in worlds and organisms . They move through our own bodies , going and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer space , perpetuating our being . They are the hum of the machinery that is working in all the various worlds , and inhabitants of all worlds . They are the living wheels of a vast system of machinery moved by the force currents of creative power . The suns and planets are the great reservoirs of working forces . Professor Trowbridge closes his recent book on " What is electricity ? " as follows : " What shall we therefore answer to the question , what is electricity ? Must we reply , we are ignorant , and we shall remain ignorant . We have already strong grounds for believing that we live in a medium which conveys to and fro , or periodic movements to us from the sun , and that these movements are electromagnetic , and that all the transformations of light and heat , and indeed the phenomena of life , are due to the electrical energy which comes to us across the vacuum which // exists between us and the sun ? a vacuum which is pervaded by the ether , and which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Says Professor S. E. Minor , " Heat , electricity , and magnetism are in their ordinary phenomena , very unlike each other , yet modern investigation has shown they are mutually convertible . Heat can be converted into electricity and electricity into magnetism . Magnetism can be converted into electricity , and electricity into heat . This indicates that these are not radically distinct , that their phenomena have a common origin , that in each we have the same force , manifested under different forms . " This is well expressed , for there is no force or attraction in nature but electricity . Ile says again , " By learning more about matter and its method of world-building we shall advance in the right line of progress toward an acquaintance with the Creator . The popular argument of first cause as a beginning in the work of creation we regard as fallacy . Al duality ) a/ ' coicoliu ' Ames must logically be the sources of all being , as when result follows cause there must be an entity outside of ' itself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true story of the creation of the heavens and the earth . The alphabet of creation 's history must he sought in the unseen forces that fashion matter , giving it place and motion , while they hide themselves iii elementary forms that move with the velocity of light , giving seed time and harvest to all worlds , and clothing them with the changing drapery of an eternal , creating potency . Our conception of these dual causative forces are the Eternal Creative Spirit , and the invisible forces of electricity operating upon etheric matter scattered through all space . CIIAPTER VI . ALL LIGHT , IIEAT AND FORCE IN NATURE IS ELECTRICITY IN SOME OF ITS FORMS . ALL light , heat , and force , in nature is electricity in some of its forms . This seems a radical statement , but the anal-ysis of scientific facts justify it . It does not trench upon the power and domain of spirit , which is back of it con-trolling and propelling it ; nor of atoms and matter which Is controlled and propelled by it . The sun is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions of the solar system . This is the present accepted scientific belief ; though it was questioned for sev-eral decades in the past half century , because the theory prevailed that if the sun was a magnet , its blazing streams of electric heat and light , were fed and kept up by frag-ments of worlds , and meteors falling into its burning bosom . Many scientists for a time refused to accept the theory that the sun was a great magnet , because of the theory that then went with it , that it was fed by burning worlds . They claimed that if true it would comparatively soon burn out , and exhaust itself , and moreover be irregu-lar in the force exerted ; whereas there has been little or no apparent diminution or irregularity of power . So that while the manner of keeping up its magnetic supply is questioned , the fact that it is a great magnet is now generally acknowledged . This being so , its rays or beams produce what ? First light , second heat , third force or power . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store it with force or power . 91 // Power to grow grass , and trees , shrubs , and flowers , and to produce all vegetable and animal life ? to produce motion , accretion and vital energy . If the life-giving rays of the sun in their wonderful alchemy contain light , heat , magnetism , and vital energy , which can not be questioned , and they are the product of electricity , then electricity contains all these , and they are but different properties of the same substance . Therefore light , heat , and force , are electricity , and they are one and interchangeable . Since the dynamic suns are the source of all light , heat , and force , iva the universe , all light , heat , and force in nature must he electricity in some of its forms . If its source is electricity , its elements are electricity . If the blazing sun is an electrical body , and the source of life-giving light , heat and force to atoms and worlds , then electricity is the power in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rays of light contain heat , the atoms of heat contain light , and both contain subtle force and energy . This is wonderfully exemplified in the recent discovery of the wonderful lloctcngeu or " . X-rays , " which have such force and power as to penetrate man 's body and illumine it , so that the bones and skeleton are plainly visible , and even the hardest substances are made transparent as glass . Who knows but what the sun looks through the earth , like we look through a crystal ? If it can look or penetrate through loan , animals , and all vegetables on its surface , why may it not penetrate the ocean , and the rock-ribbed earth ? As we know electricity is everywhere , and in everything , and the sun 's rays are electricity , what may be the effects of its penetration upon the internal fires and volcanic action of the earth ? These rays also contain all the colors of the rainbow , and photograph all nature like a mirror . Who knows but that the Almighty may look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the universe magnified and perceptible in all its details . Doctor March says : " Light is the crown and glory of the visible world . It is the source of life and energy to the body , and the symbol of truth to the soul . So far as we know it is the most beautiful and glorious of all the material works of God . The firstborn of creation , it is the ethereal body of the Omnipotent word at which it flashed into being . It is the chosen medium through which the Divine energy continues to bestow , and sustain life . Everything that lives and grows in the whole kingdom of nature derives strength and stimulus from light . " All our ideas of form and color and material beauty come to us through the agency of light . The pupil of the eye is the portal through which light brings all the riches and glories of the earth and heavens to adorn the inner chamber of the soul . The mind has only to lift the curtain of the eye , and millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hue and order of everything in the world of vision . I take in at one glance the whole range of the Alps , I gaze on the evening clouds swimming in a sea of fire around the setting sun . I see the stars bang out their golden lamps in the dome of heaven . The light has sent swift heralds from near and far to tell me the form and hue and distance of everything within the range of vision . Some of these messengers have brought their tidings in an instant , and some have been on their way a million years to tell me where of old the breath of God blew a million of suns into flame and sent them forth to sing and shine among the rival spheres of heaven . And to me it is as if this vast and varied scene were the creation of light . Take from me the faculty of vision and in place of this wondrous world of beauty , a blank and pitiless wall shuts me in on every side . The mightiest and most marvelous changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent agency of light . Light is the symbol of life of beauty and gladness . By it the gloom and horror of night vanish . The world which was silent and formless like chaos in the darkness , rises to view with clear and orderly proportions . The hills resume their wonted range , the rivers stretch their silvery haunt , the smoke of farmhouses rise , the song of birds welcome the day . All is life and action where before was silence and darkness . If we had seen but one such change from night to morning , we would think it a new creation , ? new horn realm of beauty snatched from " Chaos and Old Night , " with fresh " glory shrouded in its garb of fire. , ' The question which the most profound philosophers have never been ablc to answer , is where is the fountain from which light , springs ? And how does it fly upon its swift journeys ? All light , heat , and three , in nature is electricity in some of its furuis . Front what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lint other three or power in nature is there , except electricity ? There is none , science virtually admits it . Back of it is a greater power , the spirit of God , and the spirit of man , which propels and controls it ; before it is all matter which is its servant and plaything . But in all physicial : toms , forms and entities , there is no light , heat and force , but electricity . Even the coal , nines , the black diamonds of the earth , are but the imprisoned rays of the sun , ? but stored electricity in the bosom of nature for the use of man . The same is true of the glittering diamond , which is but a miniature sun , ? a baby tear from the dynamo of the universe , a crystallized spark of electricity . The same is true of the ruby , it is congealed fire , a frozen sunbeam , a dewdrop of sunset . // Ah ! but the physicists say , these are but stored carbon , or oxygen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and heat is electricity , and the difference is only in name . A distinction without a difference . " They say again light and heat and force and electricity are different . I answer they are only different as vapor , steam , water , ice are different . Both and all are different manifestations of the same enitity . The question may be asked " What causes the earthquake , ? those vast upheavals of the earth 's crust or surface ? " I answer ; " the heat of the internal fires causes what may be termed an etheric-clectro-chemical expansion , which displaces a part of the earth 's surface . The volcano is produced by the same cause , and are but the chimneys of mother earth for the outlet of the compressed heat , gases , and molten matter beneath her heaving bosom . " If at the Divine fiat " there was light , " light brought heat , and both brought force and life to physical existence , then all physical power is from these sources , and there is no other light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its numerous phases and functions . Electricity is stored in earth , air and water . In the earth it causes the growth of all vegetable and mineral substance . In the air and water , it mixes the elements of nature in just proportion to all the needs of inorganic and animal life . It shapes the forms , strengthens the tissue and muscles , gives action and force to all animal organism , and responds to thought and instinct . By it man wields his arm , lifts his foot , and controls his body . It converts water into vapor and vapor into steam , and propels the mighty locomotive , and the swift ocean steamer . Even now , the renowned Tesla , and the marvelous Edison , are preparing to utilize it for the world 's commerce and manufacturies , one by the direct use of the sun 's rays , and the other by the pressure and movement of the ocean 's // waves . Its use will eventually transform the world , and help to bring peace and the millennium . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such fearful explosives and engines of war , that war will mean annihilation , and the destruction of nations . Even now , the electrical appliances , and the electro-chemical combinations of dynamite , are so powerful and destructive , as to make men stand aghast at the very thought . So powerful is it , that the treacherous use of a few hundred pounds of this electrochemical combination , blew into fragments the mighty war ship , the Maine , which with its massive iron frame work , and tons of armor , sat like an island in Havana bay . And with it blew into eternity two hundred and fifty-eight unsuspecting American sailors , whose horrible , treacherous death shocked the world , and caused a long-suffering , patient nation to spring to arms to avenge the dastardly inhuman crime . A brier reference to the history of science shows that Copernicus less than four hundred years ago discovered the spherical ( ' grin of the earth , its revolution upon its axis in about twenty-lino ? hours , and its revolution around the sun in three htntdred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more difficult of acceptance than all the miraculous teachings of the preceding mythological ages . 1 t was a case where " truth is stranger than fiction . " They could much easier believe that the earth was flat , that the sun rose and set and swung round once in twenty-four hours , for this was the testimony of their senses ; or that dove and the immortal deities dwelt in the heavens just above the clouds , and met on Mount Olympus to counsel and direct the destiny of ambitious and contending mortals ; that Pluto reigned in the Inferno or dark caverns of the earth , and across the river Styx , presided over Hades , the land of departed spirits . This discovery presented to its inhabitants " a new // heaven and a new earth , " of which , in all their marvelous dreaming , they had never dreamed . Copernicus , Kepler and Newton were the true prophets of the past , the seers of the ages , the benefactors of all coin-ing generations . They lived as the rejected dreamers of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become scoffers at the discoverers of new truths . Thus the advanced thinkers find each age prepared to reject new discoveries that conflict with the old masters . Yet all new discoveries tend to simplify scientific teaching , and unify the forces and facts of nature . The Copernican system impressed Kepler with the thought that the motions of the heavenly bodies were governed by some universal law that could be reduced to exact mathematical formula , which he did ; and the same conviction led Newton to discover the law of universal gravitation . Franklin and Faraday , Harvey and Mesmer , Morse and Edison , by their discoveries , have taught us that as the potter and the clay must come together to form the rudest vessels , so creative electric force must touch every sensitive atom in organic being , and keep the wellsprings of life constantly flowing through all life forms . There is no unfolding of buds and blossom , tree and shrub , without the coming and going of electric life-giving sunlight and earth light . They pervade all bodies of mat-ter , whether world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic centres of sensation and vital or-ganisms . Atoms seek their affinities , life forces and life forms touch each other by the grasp of magnetic attraction and re-pulsion , and these give personal sensations and vital forms of being . Through the medium of electricity , material and mental forces meet together upon the plane of human consciousness . This is nature 's method of commun ' between the material and mental within the human which has been a puzzling and difficult problem of physical // science . Tyndall says " we must visualize the invisible when we transport ourselves beyond the world of senses . " Minor says " matter in its elementary state is as invisible and intangible as the forces that create and control it . " The chemist tells us " all atoms of matter are regarded as originally charged with either positive or negative electricity . " A molecule of water is made up of a positive atom of hydrogen and a negative atom of oxygen . All world building must be from atoms to combinations , from space to body . Draper says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then the electric energy of the sun is the great world-builder and life-giver . These two grand energies of space carry the great spheres so evenly poised upon the electro-magnetic floods of attraction and repulsion that all planetary motion is without resistance . They are the balancing units of universal energy , and preserve all power in universal harmony . Their home is in the silent cold and darkness of universal space . From these electric forces the cold steel and flint bring light , and the rubbed sticks of the savage produce fire , the scientist , by friction upon the revolving disc of his electric machine , gathers powerful electric currents for heat or illumination or force . Then electricity contains in its substance and forces latent heat , latent light , latent sound chords , latent sources of sun energy , earth energy and life energy , and is , in l iet , the only light , heat , force and energy in the physical universe . God built the world , but he built it under charge of the marvelous forces of electricity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixing the forms and tortes of ever-changing matter . As man is a magnetic electric body , like the sun-magnet and earth-magnet , the vibratory magnetic currents carry light to the eye , sound to the ear , heat to the body , taste to the tongue , flavor to the nostrils , and will and motive power from the mind to the body . // These same forces of electricity and magnetism uphold and move worlds as though held in the sensitive grasp of Omnipotence , and cause the planetary velocities that rival the flying radiance of the sunbeam , and produce sensations as delicate between sun and planets as between lovers at their bridal altar . With these sovereign forces there is nothing great nor nothing small ; there is infinite unity and infinitesimal diversity . There are distinct personalities and expanding impersonalities , from the mustard seed of the garden to the sun with his retinue of worlds . It is said wood and coal are simply frozen blocks of sunlight and gravity , and freezing is the rest point of attraction , as light and heat are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane of power is reached when coal and wood are converted into the heated , rushing steam ; then comes the vanishing line between ponderable and imponderable matter . But these are again converted into electricity , which is the highest dynamic state of invisible elementary substance or matter . Our civilization has seized upon the imponderable forces of electricity and converted them directly into mechanical potencies , revolving the wheels of commerce and heating and lighting our cities . It is evident , therefore , that these imponderable forces that have troubled science to classify , are supreme over matter , holding the possibilities of material forms , and the sources of all life . The great circles of forces that give us day and night , - heat and cold , are inwrought into all the circles of life , and there is close communion between the imponderable electric forces and the multiform evolutions of matter into living organisms ; and in attraction and repulsion , the choosing and refusing of these forces is an invisible organism that is more than the shadow of life in the animal and vegetable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im100 INVISIBLE LIGHT , ponderable forces . it has a real body and also a phantom body of delicate structure as real and mysterious as light , heat and life . It has a dual organism that unites the visible to the invisible world , the organic to the inorganic , the created to the uucreated and elemental . It has a centre of rest and chosen paths of motion . It has individuality , yet is part of a grand impersonality . It marks lines of latitude and longitude upon the earth , and holds communion with the sun in its daily circle , and quivers under auroral displays of electric power . The earth and magnetic needle have each an invisible electric or phantom body , manifested by currents of force that give them rest and motion . The sun also has his electro-magnetic or phantom body of forces and across ninety-two million miles separating earth from sun , he holds communion with earth and needle , with land and sea , and the multiform organisms of earthly matter . The forces of the magnet and the sunbeams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon earth and sun . ' I'liese 1in ? ces have bridged the great chasm separating sun and planets with a structure of ibrces as real and enduring as the steel of the magnet . Did the sun and planets antedate these forces , or these forces antedate the world 's ? This is answered by asking , did the Creator antedate creation ? These forces propelled the grand velocities of the planets , and created them , and all they contain , under the divine impulse or word of the creative spirit , when according to Moses , God said " Let there be light , and there was light . " What then is the cause of planetary growth , and planetary motion ? I answer , electricity or electro-magnetism , light , heat , force , magnetism , all included under the one word electricity . It creates the marvelous velocity without which the planets would stop , and fall into darkness and chaos . // No visible or physical forces could work such wonders , and the materialist who worships at the shrine of the material , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should bow his head in the dust before the Creator of the invisible cosmic forces that are the master-builders of the universe , and the right hand of infinite power . Professor Trowbridge , the eminent scientist of Harvard University , in his recent work on electricity , says " According to modern ideas , the continuance of all life on the earth is due to the electrical energy which we receive from the sun . " According to the electro-magnetic theory of light all phenomena of light , and heat , as well as those of electricity , are manifestations of electrical energy . The subject of physics can be said to be the study of the transformations of energy . Indeed the characteristics of physical science to-day is its reliance upon patient observation and the study of the transformation of electricity into light and heat , or the transformation of heat into electricity . " Maxwell 's theory that light and heat are phenomena of electro-magnetic waves which come to us from the sun is now the greatest generalization in physical science , and in stating it Maxwell lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entire world is now working upon this great hypothesis . According to the electromagnetic theory of light , the only difference between light , heat and electricity consists in the length of waves in the ether of space . The sun is the source of electro-magnetic waves , and the earth is the scene of transformation of electric energy . A piece of coal burning in a grate has therefore a long electro-magnetic history . It owed its origin to electromagnetic waves , and in burning it gives out again electromagnetic waves , of which we can only detect the light and heat manifestations . " The doctrine of the conservation of energy is little more than a hundred years old ; yet this great physical doctrine // has accomplished great results in the commercial world . In the medical world the doctrine is daily being recognized ; for the application of external heat to the human body to diminish the effort of the human organism to supply heat , or to supplement this effort in very young children , or very old people is now clearly understood . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the want of heat . Very young children also often perish because they are not supplied with sufficient heat . This external heat which is a form of electricity facilitates the various transformations of energy which are going on in the unman organism , so that too great a demand for it is not made on the internal mechanism . The transformations of energy in the human body are more difficult , than those of an ordinary steam engine , for they are more numerous and subtle . However there is a close relation between the amount of food consumed , and the work a man can do . The steam engine is still the most powerful instrument for studying the transformation of energy , and steam is still the most economical agent for producing electricity . In the best engines It pound of coal will produce a horsepower , which is cheaper than water-power , because regulation and control of the water supply is more difficult . Steam is produced by the combustion of a past vegetation . The original action of electro-magnetic waves is shown in the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages , which being exhumed , by combustion again becomes evident in a grand series of transformations . The burning of a fossilized tree produces steam , steam produces motion which is converted into electricity , and electricity into heat and light . The only difference between heat and light consists in wave length ; the heat waves are much longer than the light waves . // The coal which generates the steam which drives the engine was produced by electro-magnetic waves from the sun . These waves in the dim past , in the form of light and heat , nourished the great fern and palm trees and luxuriant vegetation , which being buried in earth became our vast coal mines . Now by the combustion of this coal , which produces again through the dynamo these light and heat waves , originally from the sun , the electric energy is again transformed into motion ; and the electricity from the sun that lighted and warmed the earth ages ago , again gives it light and heat and motion . Hardly a tenth of the electro-magnetic energy stored in coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make itself manifest , if we knew how to obtain electrical power direct from it . The steam engine is the chief source of electricity to-day , yet electricity is back of the steam engine and is in the coal and heat that runs it . The spectacle of the transformation of energy by the dynamo in our great cities is most impressive . At the central station are immense steam engines which are whirling the movable coils of the dynamos on axles which run at about one thousand evolutions a minute . The dynamos weigh tons , whereas the early dynamos could be lifted by one man . The electricity they send out along the wire , returns to them by the iron rails of the car lines , or through the earth . Let us consider man as an electric engine . The food he consumes answers to the fuel we put under the boiler of the engine , and the source of this is also vegetation the same as coal , and the ultimate source of all vegetation is the electro-magnetic radiation of the sun . Animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid . Joule points out that man resembles an electro-magnetic engine , and shows that man as an engine is far more efficient than any // known engine in which there is a consumption of fuel . In man food , together with oxidizing processes produce motion and animal heat . Many attempts have been made to measure the efficiency of the man-engine , by weighing the food consumed , and measuring the work done . The transformations of the food by electro-chemical process however are so varied and subtle , it is difficult to estimate them . In general the amount of work a man does bears a certain proportion to the fuel he puts into his boiler . In modern medicine the conservation of energy is recognized , and heat is supplied to invalids in order to relieve the human engine from supplying it . The excess of heat in cases of fever is checked by the application of cold water ; and various indicators used to ascertain the horsepower of engines are employed by physiologists to study the action of the heart as a pumping machine . Plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected by incn and animals . By the radiant energy of the sun they are able to decompose carhnuie acid . They fbrur a storage cell in which a current of electricity decomposes the liquid into oxygen and hydrogen , and fin ? nc materials which again give electricity , emotion , and heat . The sun enables the plant engine to work . The electrochemical or shortest waves of light are most effective in the plant engine in decomposition of carbonic acid , and in photography give the cold tar dyes and developers which are used to produce pictures of the very plants which have produced them . Professor Ray Lankaster says , " The simplest living things are the cells of plants and they are joined by threads of protoplasm . In the cells of plants it used to be supposed that each mass of protoplasm was shut off in solitary confinement from its neighbors , but now it is found that in vegetable tissue also there are exceedingly fine threads // passing through from one cell to another , thus insuring the continuity of the protoplasm in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protoplasm are that it must have food , must have access to oxygen and must be acted on by some external stimulus . The stimulus may be of various kinds , and may be afforded by light , heat , electricity and chemical conditions . " Thus light , heat , electricity are the creating , developing energies of the simplest original elementary life-forms of all matter , and the same electric energies develop the highest forms of all living organisms . These cells of protoplasm are infinitesimal magnets , all vegetables are but larger magnets , all animals still larger , till we get to worlds and suns , the greatest of them all . All the radiant garments of creation , in their varied colors of light and beauty that now appear to human vision , are woven from the same garments of immortality that wrap themselves around the initial centres of magnetic attraction and electrical forces , which are the centres of world creations . And as the worlds were created by invisible electric forces under the guidance of the Omnipotent Creative Spirit , so these same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfinished structures , and perfecting the unity and completing the harmony of creation . What we now call growth is electric attraction and accretion that was commenced at the beginning of nature 's work of creation , and which continues to be the occult forces that secure the growth of a blade of grass , the unfolding of the tiniest seed with its inwrapped life germ and the development of a world , and which brings us face to face with the creative force that was the starting point of the " beginning , " and will be the culminating centre of all ultimate perfected creation . It touches each growing seed , as at the beginning it touched each growing world centre , and // // reveals the power and wisdom of creation in every evolving form of life . The same electric radiate lines that give the parental image in the mirror by an instantaneous flash of light , give also the parental image in the germ life that evolves a new paternity . While we can not trace the lines of electrical union that are mingled in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radiant matter must have bridged the chasm between the old lives and the new , between parental duality and the dual forces of electricity , that produced a new germinal individuality . And the new life can not be possible without the separate unfolding of two distinct organisms meeting in generative embrace imparting a new seed-life . All germ life has its beginning in matter where positive and negative magnetic currents blend into unity . In the vegetable kingdom the circle of life from germ to fruitage is from magnetic centre to magnetic centre , the one an evolving centre , the other an involving , the magnetic or radial lines of matter converging from without iii the unfolding life , and from within the plant to the germ in the unfolding life . Our ideas of physical creation begin with the atoms of the sixty-four chemical substances in nature constituting matter , each atom having an identity fixed and immortal , and from which the world and all therein have been fashioned . l lectricity working upon these invisible etheric elements , and substances gathered from the infinitudes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creation . The germinal life , and the food supply of the plant , fix the boundaries of its being . There can be no evolution of plant life into animal life . It is not scientific to search for such an irrational order of development . Vegetable , plant and tree in their organic life structure never become ani- mals . They have no independent existence separate from the sun and earth , except as latent in seed-germ . Cut off the electric sun currents from their leaves , and the electric earth currents from their roots , and they are at once weakened and destroyed . From these electric currents the work of plant assimilation goes forward , building the plant structures from the germinal seed centre cell by cell both upward toward the sun and downward toward the centre of the earth , properly balancing the upward and down-ward growth to the unfolding organism . Thus by the blending of the positive and negative cir cles of the magnetic circuit where broken circuits reunite , are produced the mysterious circles of life . As all material organism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawing their atoms from electrical cur-rents , so all life germs take their growth from the magnetic centres of their growing forms . Here in the field of elec tric forces is to be found the generative forces of organic matter ? the mysterious births of all parental life . And the constantly revolving circle of periodic changes of growth and decay ? of life and death , ? of seed beginning and seed producing , like sunshine and shadow , light and darkness , are opposite points in the circle of physical life . The growing and dying life forms intervene between these two points of rest and renewal , of attraction and repulsion , of positive organism , and negative diffusion of matter . They are the results , of the great electric system of at tracting , and repelling currents of magnetism that are as fixed in their lines of force and order of work , as the rocks at the foundations of the mountains . In fact all that is strong and abiding in matter rests upon these currents of energy , and all of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these unseen electrical polem ics of creation . Life is a universal unity , as light , heat ; electricity and polarization which evolve it are unities. // The order of ascending life organism is from the simple to the complex , from the lowest plane of rock formation the series is upward , from the lowest form of vegetable life it is up to the highest and in the animal life upward till the crowning work is reached in the thinking animal we call man . To each ascending form there is an endowment of sell-perpetuation , by parentage , and seed fruitage which involy e the electroanaguetie condition of germ life . Thus , by electrical forces plants build within each other and form others by elementary atoms , with power of selfpropa , gation bridging the life gulf between silent atom and living or gall isel , as if they were the material work of some spiritual builder . Thus , by electrical forces nature builds all human and animal life forms and organisms . The primary atoms of matter have . their home in the electric-magnetic forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creation . ' When the elcet , ro-magnetic origin of light , heat , and force is 1 ' 111ly accepted and its dynamic energy traced to its potential body we have re ; i , ched the strength of primary electrical forces , and the unending circles of electrical potencies . This brings us to the border land of creative work , to the mysterious sea of all life-giving forces , and the universal basis of all existing creations . Here spirit , matter , and electricity , the three great basic entities of creation work together in full accord in evolving and fashioning all material growth and material structures . In material growth protoplasm gives the material conditions of life without which there could be no food supplies . They contain grouped elements of oxygen , nitrogen , hydrogen , and carbon , out of which living structures are reared . Life is dependent upon food supplies of matter , which supplies must be raised to radiant conditions by electric forces to secure its assimilation into living organic // forms . Life therefore like light seeks through magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its working presence . Upon such a plain all forms of life come to birth From a common parentage , ? from electric force and radiant matter , each form endowed with personality , and powers of production , that make them factors of life and growth upon the radiant plane of creative potencies . In tins electrical radiant elementary plane of matter , to which all forms of matter are transparent as the atmossphere is to sunlight , we find the material basis of all material life . The electric affinities in matter proclaim an electrical origin . This brings the problem of life to its nearest scientific solution . Here the mysteries of the origin of life is but little greater than the miracle of its continuance . By tracing the elements of matter to their source in electrical and magnetic energy we have reached the ultima thule and dug into the foundation upon which is built the eternal structures of the universe and the bounds of all creation . It is as far as the wisest scientist can go ; and yet he has not reached the eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undying soul . He has but fixed the natural boundaries at which complex forms of organic life take up their progressive orders of being . Science has been unable to discover the presence of indwelling intelligence at any of the sources of material life . The conditions of life in its radiant elemental forms and in the protoplasm , disclose no soul powers , or spiritual affinities in matter ; and yet the perfection of the immutable laws by which they are guided shows there is above and around them an Omniscient lawgiver , a divine intelligence , an Omnipotent spiritual power " unsearchable and past finding out . " Here the eternal intelligent spirit of man must recognize the work of his eternal spiritual father , // and reasoning from the known in matter to the unknown in matter and the known in revelations , exclaim " The heavens declare the glory of God , and the firmament showeth his handiwork . " CHAPTER VII . ELECTRICITY IS THE GREAT CHEMIST , WONDER-WORKER AND WORLD-BUILDER . ELECTRICITY is the great chemist and wonder-worker of the universe . Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It unites all the properties of water , all the elements of air , all the composition of metals , and forms all the homogeneous and heterogeneous substances of earth . It not only forms all visible objects , by producing and controlling the motion of atoms , and enforcing the laws of selection and affinity ; but it reduces them back to their original elements , causes the purification of nature , and preserves the immortality of atoms . At the behest of the Divine Spirit , it wrought the wonders of boundless creation . It took the invisible solution of etheric atoms scattered through- the void of space , and by the law of evolution shaped them into all the diversified forms and organisms of nature . It mixed in just proportion to the laws of life the elements of air and water , earth and seas . It caused the forms and growth of vegetable life , the organism of all animal structure , the survival of the fittest , and the development and modifications of species by the laws of descent and environments . It built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suns and planets , satellites and comets . It formed the sunbeam and the dewdrop , the prismatic colors of the rainbow , and set the tiny battery in the pulsing protoplasm , and the gigantic magnet in the blazing suns . It shoots the lightning through the clouded heavens with potentiality of a billion 111 // volts to send it one mile athwart the horizon . Who can estimate its power , fur by its invisible force it whirls the earth around its axis like a swift revolving wheel , and shoots it through space forty times faster than a cannon ball . It impresses spiritual law upon all matter , and is found in all atoms . I t sits at the throne of physical life , and works the miracle of health and growth . We have all heard of the wonderful " X-rays , " and the benefits they may be to science in penetrating dense substances , and making visible the internal organs of the body . So that by its wonderful rays the bones and skeleton of man and animals may be examined . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , and brain , and stomach , are being investigated in the interest of science . And some are claiming that the mysterious action of thought , and ideality are pictured and tirade visible in the brain , and their tracery and lineaments may be photographed by its means . So , that it would not be so wonderful a miracle for science by means of these electrical agents in a few decades to lay bare the secrets of the physical organism , and the mysteries of thought , and mental action . The " X-rays " are but the electric currents or element in light concentrated and intensilied . Electricity performs the miracle of digestion and assimilation of ( boil and the purification of the blood . It produces health and growth and decay and dissolution , and is the law of vitality and physical atoms . The recent news comes from Harvard University , that Professor Trowbridge is a new Jupiter of science who hurls his own thunderbolts , measures the lightning 's force , and has constructed an apparatus that upsets all time-honored theories . lie has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacuum , and produces queer photographic effects by turning the light on protected plates . Science is rapidly tearing aside the veil that hides the cause of all natural phenomena . Not content with tracking the // lightning to its lair , and forcing it to work for the comfort of man instead of terrifying , and occasionally killing him , it is now able to gauge the tremendous force behind it , that sends it to the earth in a flash , and to manufacture machinemade lightning . Professor Trowbridge found that to produce his four feet of lightning it took 1,200,000 volts , and the length of the flash varied directly with the force which is necessary to produce it . He then made the calculation that for the discharge of a flash of lightning one mile long , at least 1,000,000,000 volts would be required , showing the immense force that nature has stored away in her aerial workshop . It also upsets a scientific theory that has long been undisputed , and that is that electric sparks avoid a vacuum . But the powerful discharge from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have no power to resist them . The discharge through the so-called vacuum tubes were of a dazzling X-ray nature , and the skeleton of the hand could be plainly seen by their aid . This is destined to change the scientific conception of what constitutes a vacuum , and upset many theories . The photographic phenomena of this powerful machine are startling , showing various curious electrical effects which are invisible to the eyes , and may bring to light many wonderful things in connection with the mysterious action of electricity in passing through the air , and the rarefied spaces between us and the sun , which are ordinarily called a vacuum , and have been supposed to be a non-conductor of electricity . When we recognize the fact that it takes a billion of volts to send a flash of lightning one mile through the air , am I not justified in saying it is the most powerful force , and the only force in nature , that could work the miracle of creation . That it is the wonder-worker of the universe , ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // glowing constellations , and sent them forth as from the plastic hand of Deity to swing in the revolving cycles of the countless spheres . The master-builder of the universe , the architect of the eternal spirit . In the science of chemistry there are mathematic formulas by which atoms of matter of which chemists can gain no actual knowledge are united together in chemical unions under the rigid laws of atomic affinities . Thus they find , aft ponderable combinations of matter are built up from and by the unseen and imponderable . I n the formation of water two gases , oxygen and hydrogen unite in the proportion of eight parts oxygen to one of hydrogen . These gases the chemist may mete out but there is demanded the energy of an electric shock to form the union , and this third clement of power converts the union of the two gases into a new body . In this chemical union there is revealed the presence of a creative energy from the unseen and imponderable forces that is not inchided in matter in its three states ? this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elements of water , and no lifie upon the earth . Again the salt , held in solution in the waters of the ocean has electric affinities and prevents stagnation and impurity , and enhances evaporation which is necessary to the preservation of all life , and here electric energy presides over the union of sodium and chlorine creating a new form of matter or substance . 1 ; Iectro-positive sodium , and electro-negative chlorine unite according to the great law of electro-magnetism , namely unlike elements attract while like elements repel . Chemistry gives us nature 's formula for the second or liquid state of matter , ? three gases , oxygen , hydrogen , and chlorine , one metal , sodium , two of the elements , sodium and hydrogen being electro-positive , and two oxy-. gen and chlorine electro-negative , these elements thus bound together cover two-thirds of the earth , and is the // preservative of all life on the planet . Here again we find electrical energy the creating and preserving force on our planet . In like rigid formula is the solid state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon , which is necessary to both animal and vegetable life , and is an electro-positive element , and at a high temperature has a strong aflinity for oxygen . It is indestructible in the heat of combustion and in its union with hydrogen and oxygen the cells of plants , trees and vegetables are built up in the magnetic heat of the sunbeam . Without this wonderful element of plant life , animal life , and large portions of rock structures the continents could not have been built . The same laws of electro-magnetism apply to it. , and control all atoms , organic structures and affinities whether solid , liquid or gaseous : so that we may affirm that electricity is a dual substance , force or energy permeating all the elements of earth-building and which commands and preserves all creative work . It is the elementary all-indomitable creative power that controls , visible and invisible matter whether in one atom or an aggregation constituting suns and worlds . It was at " the beginning " and sprang forth in response to the divine fiat " Let there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life creator , and universe preserver , with tireless , ever-balanced , perpetual motion in atoms , worlds and space , with the sweep of Omnipotent strength , and the velocity of lightning . We learn that there are three states of matter , the solid , the liquid , and the gaseous . Professor Crookes says there is " a fourth state of matter , " which he names the " ultragaseous . " And Minor calls the fourth " gaseous and electro-magnetic . " ( In this classification light , heat , gravity , electricity and magnetism are left out , except by Minor , who thinks the electro-magnetic should be included . ) And yet he can give no definition of this fourth or elementary // state for he says " we can not ask after source , boundaries or foundation of either the elements or the energy that sweeps through space witli the invisible flow of the electric and magnetic waves . Like space and gravity there is nothing thinkable beyond , beneath , above or before them . " Electro-untignetie attraction like the power of falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravital centres of the worlds of space , and repnlsion lifts them again in mist from the ocean , and in waste gases from decaying matter , back to a place among the cicments of space from which they had been taken . Their energies are the carrying and transmuting forces of matter producing its changes , its motion and velocities , and fixing its paths of revolution . Prol*cssor Tyndall says " we conclude heat and electricity are modes of motion , we know that from electricity we can get Beat , mud from heat we can get electricity . But our ideas are very nuclear as to the precise nature of the change , ? in fiat , we know as yet nothing about it . " Certainly not whctu they are but different expressions of the saiwe force . 11 , Nvoidd be just as sensible to speak of the modes of a sunheam , or the fashion of a cyclone . Matter , end the forces that now touch matter in every atom are supposed to have separate beginnings , and been bronglit together by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when matter and the cosmic , electric fbives were blended , which unfold life forms wherever atmosphere , light , heat and moisture give living environments . The distinction between matter and the invisible forces that move ivaUer have never been clearly drawn , while the distinction between , mind and matter are treated as a basic principle . Docks , mountains and plains , rivers , seas and oceans , vegetables , shrubs , trees and animals , are all built into // place under the unfailing providence of these benign , invisible forces of sun and planet . Space is not a vacuum , but rather the home of these forces , whence came all motion , and the perennial fountain out of which come the forms of creative work , as vegetable , tree and animal , which are woven out of these electric sun forces and earth forces , establishing germ centres , and unfolding all possible forms of body and of life . The sweep of planets like the earth one thousand miles in a minute of time reveal the wonderful force of invisible electro-magnetism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to plant life and animal life , but the great sovereign builder is the sun forces , which gives the chief supply of carbon to plants and oxygen to animal life , and store the same in the rock-ribbed structure of the earth . The sun energy not only builds up but decomposes and builds again . Draper says " the light and heat that warm and illuminate our dwellings , and the light of the sun 's rays are the same . Force can not be created , it came from the sun . When we read by gas or by the rays of a petroleum lamp , the light we use was derived from the sun perhaps millions of years ago . " Carbon and oxygen are termed " flame-giving compounds , " they are derived from the atmosphere and the sun . But whence came the sun ? Draper says " heis the issue of nebular condensation . " But whence came the nebula ? and whence the power of condensation ? We answer , nebula came from the invisible etheric atoms , or elementary , imponderable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical attraction . Thus nebular condensation into worlds and organic forms , has been carried forward under the balancing energies of electric attraction and repulsion ; and they held nebulous matter under control then as they now control the // great globes of the solar system , and all their organic structures . Some scientists think " It is difficult to separate atoms of matter from the energy of matter . " They affirm " that the cncryy of world-building is in the atom , as truly as the ma.tcrial of world-building . " This is true , since electricity in some form pervades all atoms , all matter , and all worlds . These could have neither motion , affinity nor vitality without it . But it is a distinct entity poured into it , or surging through it , as water in a sponge , or as blood through animal organiser . It is not an integral elemental part of matter , yet it is essential to its life and activity , and is the soul of matter , the invisible , controlling spirit of matter , as intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . ' Phis electrical sun energy which is associated with all atoms and matter , has a never ending cycle from the sun to the plant an ( the animal now in the air , now a part of the plant or auinml , now back again in the air . Derived from the smilw un , it lad . hidden in plant or animal , awaiting its release under t1w finer of heat or decomposition , and then reniingling with tice universal electrical cosmic forces from which it land been of old derived from the sun , or from which the sun himself was derived . ' Plus t.le cycle is complete from electric cosmic energy and a.torns of space through the sunlight , heat and energy to plant luring and animal forms , back through the flame of combustion , or tl. release of decomposition to electric cosmic conditions of sun and space . Balfour Stewart declares " a simple elementary atom is truly an imuu ) rtal being , and enjoys the privilege of remaining unaltered , and essentially unaffected amid the most powerful blows that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ceaseless activity and change of form , but it is nevertheless always the same . This ceaseless activity is a barrier // to an intimate acquaintance with molecules and atoms . The limit upon our senses with respect to space and time preclude our acquaintance with these exceedingly - minute bodies which are the raw materials of which the whole universe is built . " These " immortal atoms and raw material , " give substance and form to all the varied combinations of matter , and are built up under the constant working energy of the electro-magnetic forces , which forces are Newton 's law of universal gravitation in its fullest , broadest sense . Thus we reach material universal unity , which the law of Kepler taught , and which the electro-positive and negative teach , and which electro-chemical action and uniformity of light from all worlds in all ages confirm . Professor Eliliu Thomson has invented a remarkable process called electric welding . With electric currents he speedily melts bars of iron and other metals and welds theirs together so that the strength at that point is superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metals can thus be welded together which can not be joined by brazing or soldering . By this process the heat is applied at the exact point , great heat is developed , the bars are raised to a white heat at their junction , and are then pushed together . This process is used in welding shells used in warfare , and annealing steel armor-plates , which are so hard they resist the action of ordinary tools , and have to be softened in order to allow the boring for bolts . It is said our inventors have been unconsciously imitating lightning in producing dynamos which will give to and fro , or fluctuating currents , for every bolt of lightning is not one continuous discharge , but an alternating current which pulsates to and fro ten or twelve times or even more in the millionth of a second . The ordinary electric car is propelled by a dynamo which is similar to the dynamo at the central station which generates the continuous current of electricity utilized by the // dynamo motor in the car . The dynamo motor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dynamo can thus he the counterpart of the other . The motor can be made the generator , or the generator the motor . Recent success in transmitting power over twenty-one miles is due to the alternating motor . All fit Ills of vegetable and animal life are electrical machines . The primordial cell is a simple tiny galvanic battery . So are : ill plants , some of which are so full of electricity they are called electric plants . So are the tiniest bugs and insects . So are the largest , and smallest animals , from the ant to the elephant , from the butterfly to man . They are all electrical machines , and their physical atoms , limbs and Inactions are influenced and controlled by electricity . I ii man , and in nearly all animals the electrical battery is in the head or brain , and from thence it sends out along the spinal column and nerves the life-giving electric currents , : nd receiy es in return by electric currents reports from all parts of the body . ' I'liere are also smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . All this is well known and accepted by anatomists. 1'hysicia , ns now recognize the importance of electricity to the health and strength of the body , and all kinds of electrical contriv:uices are now used to restore health and strengtha . ' Phcrc are of recent years , many electric physicians who restore strength and health to the feeble and sick by the electricity from their own bodies . By manipulating the diseased parts they restore them to their normal condition by supplying the electricity needed . Man 's body is an electrical machine , and electricity can be conveyed front one body to another . This largely accounts for mesmerism , hypnotism , and all forms of animal magnetism . It also , not infrequently saves the lives of very sick and weak persons to have them come in contact with a vigorous human body , the electricity therefrom bringing // renewed life and strength . One mother told me she had saved the lives of two of her children , when they were infants and very weak by continually holding them close to her body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickering spark of life almost went out , and only recovered when she pressed them close to her body . It is said that " light , heat , gravitation , mechanical force , electricity , magnetism and chemical affinity have been regarded as outside the universe of matter ; while space has been regarded as a vacuum simply affording a place for grand velocities . " Yet out of these realms come all the grand facts and forces that control the three visible forms of matter , solid , liquid and gaseous . From thence come the wonderful phenomena of life , soul , spirit , thought , consciousness , with all the elements of mind force . It is the magnetic field from which come all the changes of matter , and all that we know of life . In the veiled mysteries of these invisible realities is the realm of immortality and pure spiritual existences . Our knowledge of this radiant , imponderable state of matter must begin with matter in its solid or ponderable state . Mind or spirit in material structures stands back in the dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving forms of matter . Matter in its radiant or diffused state is not only without weight , but lifts weights , in its solid state it is seemingly without power , and is called dead or inert , while in its liquid state it has only the power of position , like a falling weight . Faraday saw lines of force traversing all space , and a medium through which they were manifested . Says Professor Mayer all material phenomena come into our field of vision as effects produced by an unseen potency . This potency consists of a universal presence surrounding bodies of matter in space , weaving around them lines of force of infinite fineness equal to the measure of the ele122 INVISIBLE LIGHT , mentary atoms of which such bodies have been formed . For the magnetic field of radiant matter surrounding the body is as truly a part of " its complete structure as are the solids , liquids and gases of its sensible form . " The sauce author says " The sweep of the great circular paths of the planets around the sun reveals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's energy of attraction . " These two forces of electrical energy deny the law of inertia in matter and proclaim the eternal , perpetual motion of atoms . These occult forces working through all of matter that is gathered in planetary form , saturate such planetary bodies with occult electric energy as the steel of the magnet is saturated with such forces . The electric radiant matter revealed in a sunbeam is the source of all power upon the earth , and their electric currents carry with them a power no ingenuity of man can measure . " In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth , " this creation was wrought out by the agency of electrical forces operating on invisible elementary matter , controlled lay the intellectual impulse of an infinite power . It seems impossible that divine power or impulse or spirit could work directly upon matter , it must work through a medium or agency . It could not impart velocity to planetary bodies by a spiritual agency equal to the so-called attraction of gravitation between bodies of matter , giving them a compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity of thirty miles in a second of time . But the eternal creative spirit using the marvelous creating forces of electricity first spoken into existence by the word of his spiritual power through their perpetual everworking influence on invisible ether on elementary forms of matter evolved all the varied forms of creation . Thus by creating electricity and condensing the sun and planets // into vast magnets revolving in a sea of electro-magnetic forces , the marvelous machinery of the universe was constructed . This machinery of the universe became self-propelling and self-sustaining by reason of the laws of motion , growth and evolution impressed upon it , or by the joint sovereignty of two equal correlative forces , magnetism , a form of electricity maintains the sovereignty of attraction over matter in body , while electricity , another phase of the same forces , maintains the sovereignty of repulsion over matter in space . Thus electricity is a universal power joining together the two kingdoms of the heavens and the earth  --  of matter in body , and matter in space . And these forces in their unity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust of the balance . " These forces working on invisible atoms , molecules , and suns and worlds give organic unity and universal harmony . These floods of electricity and magnetism effect the least and the greatest ? " directly as mass , and inversely as the square of the distance . " The sun and planets are vast magnets because they are held in charge of electro-magnetic forces in an immense magnetic field . These forces are not from these bodies originally , but these bodies are from the forces . The primary state of matter is the diffused etheric invisible radiant state , and the building of matter into body is the work of these forces when in charge of matter under organic affinities . Magnetic lines of force fix centres and build around such centres by drawing elemental matter from the radiant sea of space by magnetic energy into globular forms that become growing worlds ; drawing their power and increase of form from the sea of invisible matter in which they are fixed by their axis and orbit lines of motion and force constituting them working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // motion ever working , ever evolving and building world forms , vegetable and animal forms . The sun having grown from the sea of invisible etheric nebulous matter by means of these wonderful electric-magnetic forces into an immense magnet larger than all the planets of the solar system combined ; holds them in the magnetic field of his sovereign power , and is through these flowing currents of electricity the creating , governing force in the solar system . These same electric forces are formed into smaller magnets and electric machines which form electric centres . and build up all tangible forms of matter , human , animal and vegetable . W7ithont these floods of electric substance or power that come to us iu the light of the sun , that flow in currents of strength through our bodies as they propel the inflowing and outflow ing floods of atomic elements of matter that are ladened with incoming supplies of daily life , and outgoing wastes , by attraction and repulsion , assimilation of food , respiration and perspiration , our bodily forms would be wholly unlit li , r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing , tasting , smelling , feeling that connect us with the world of matter are entirely dependent on electricity and the invisible etheric forms of matter that surround its everywhere , and constitute the connecting ties , the invisible ligaments that pervade and bind all forms of life iat na'ture 's wondrous harmony . The chemists have discovered and numbered sixty-four elementary substances in matter , yet they are largely varied combinations of each other , and like solids , liquids , and gases and invisible ether are different forms of the everchanging atoms , but eternally the same indestructible matter . Sir John Herschel declares " The sun 's rays are the ultimate source of almost every motion that takes place upon the surface of the earth . By its heat are produced // all winds , and those disturbances in the electric equilibrium ' which give rise to the phenomena of lightning , and the aurora . By their vivifying action vegetables draw support from inorganic matter and become in their turn supporters of animals and man , and the source of those great deposits of dynamic efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strata . " While this is true , it is also true that the radiant imponderable matter of universal space is the primary source of all material power , or universal energy . The sun is the vast fountain and receptacle of that marvelous electrical energy and virgin matter diffused through all space ; but it is not necessarily the source of it . It is the central magnetic controlling source and expression of it through all the solar system . But other world systems have their controlling magnetic sun forces from the same exhaustless sources . And the boundless fountains of infinite energy through measureless space are superior to any mere sun form of visible expression of such energy . The flood of radiant electrical energy that saturate and enwrap the sun and planets in orbital lines of Omnipotent strength , are to these bodies the everlasting fountains from which flow their upholding and evolving power . As all visible forms of matter are built from elementary atoms , so the most efficient display of electrical power finds their expression and source in the same elementary atoms . Professor Tyndall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rays have a greater chemical and heating power than the illuminated lines . It is said " The universe of matter can neither melt with fervent heat , ' or be rolled together like a scroll , ' so long as the cold , dark , silent forces of gravitation maintain their power over matter . " As the sun and earth are huge magnets , the poles of the // earth are reversed to those of the sun , and laws of magnetic attraction teach us that positive and negative polar forces flowing oppositely between sun and earth establish the bond of union between them . If this be so the transfer of electric , energy must be equal between them , and the flow thronglI space at the low level of latent energy . These two oppositely moving floods of electrical energy , passing under the great law of electro-magnetic attraction pass through ninety-two million miles of radiant matter in eight minutes of time , and enter the resisting atmosphere of sun and earth , their currents thrilling with energy at the high tension of opposite polarities beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as gravitation , or electro-magnetism pours a constant flood of light and heat upon both sun and planets . Thus the electric light and heat of the sun and planets of the solar system evolved from their resisting atmosphere , become creative potencies , deriving their vast power from each other , and from their env ironing space of virgin imponderable matter , and thereby giving life motion and utility to all visible created things . According to this theory there is no solar waste , or planet waste , while the electro-magnetic creative power is evolved at the point of time and placein which the force is needed and the work accomplished . CHAPTER VIII . GOD CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE AS MAN CONTROLS HIS BODYBY ELECTRICITY . THE spirit of God " moving upon the face of the waters , " the word of his power that spoke light and life into existence , " the breath of life " he breathed into man were but names for a reality , a means used , a something employed to accomplish a result . What were they ? The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . " How can spirit speak to matter , or matter hear or feel the " word " or " movings of spirit " ? There must be a means of communication , a connecting-link , a vehicle of perception , a medium of transmission of spiritual will and purpose to insensate matter . This should be invisible like thought ? subtle like perception , and powerful like spirit . What substance or force in nature can approach these definitions , or is suitable for such a purpose ? We answer , only one ? electricity in its numerous forms and manifestations . How does God control the universe ? We answer , in the same way as man controls his body , by the forces of electricity operating upon matter . Back of these forces is the will of God , or the will of man , propelled by the living intelligent spirit . God is everywhere ? in everything in all the universe , in every atom . Certainly , because electricity is there responsive to his every will , and working out his divine behests ; just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish and purpose of his soul or spirit . Thus God is omnipresent and omnipotent . Just as the soul of man in a healthy body is omnipresent and omnipotent in that body , 127 // Only God is infinite and eternal in his domain , and man is transitory and imperfect in the control of his fleeting tenement of clay . All things originate and have their existence in God . " In him we live , move and have our being . " Ilow do we live , move and have our being in God ? The scriptures say he created us in his image , anal breathed into us the breath of life and " man became a living soul . " This " breath of life " is a part of the spirit of ' Cod , and constitutes the spiritual body of man . This spiritual body permeates every atom of the physical body , weaves its flesh through electric action , preserves its autonomy , and gives it intelligent vitalizing life and power . The spiritual body in man thus controls the atoms and functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit dominates and controls the physical universe . As electricity is the right hand of God 's power in governing all his visible creations , and the connecting-link between spirit and matter , so is it the right-hand of the soul of man in controlling through the dictates of spirit his physical body . I t is the medium of communication between soul and insensate matter ? it telegraphs the wish or the will , the thought or the impulse of mind to all its habiliments of flesh and nerve and blood . It obeys man 's spiritual and reasoning faculties , and runs along the nerve tissues as along connecting wires causing the body to obey the behests of spirit , and preserves life and harmony there , as in the boundless universe . Man has live senses , ? seeing , hearing , feeling , smelling , tasting . These are all communicated to the soul or spiritual body by electricity . Man feels through the electric flashes that come from every part of his body , ? that tingle on the nerves , beat upon the brain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees through the medium of the electric etheric // waves of light that come from the vibrations of the air around him . The infinitesimal rays of etheric light enter the retina of the eye , and touch the quick vision of the soul . ple hears by the atmospheric waves of electricity that beat upon his ear drums , and strike the sensitive chords of the listening spirit . 13e tastes and smells by the same electric process , and his five senses are but the outward communication of surrounding conditions and substances , to his mental or spiritual perception , by means of electricity . Truly , this wonderful substance gives marvelous touch and activity to the human hand , and skill to the cleft fingers , as they are directed by the majesty of mind . It makes the soul vibrate with exquisite pleasure or keenest pain , as it tenders to its spiritual seeing , feeling , throbbing master the external proofs of surrounding things and conditions . Thus , God from the spiritual centre of the universe sees , hears and knows all things . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch the hem of his mystic garments , and fall in beautiful rainbows at his feet . They bring to him the music of the singing spheres , and the silence of untenanted space speaks to him in the " still small voice " of the refined , electric currents . They bear his thoughts on the wings of invisible lightning and carry his saints to their eternal rest by his great white throne . They write his name on the granite hills , and in the rock-ribbed foundations of the earth they explode the earthquake , tread the pathway of the cyclone , and spread the fiery tresses of the blazing comet . They throw the aurora of eternal brightness above his fadeless brow , and canopy the dome of heaven with diamond coronets . They glisten in the sea of glass , and burnish the streets of gold , and make his abode the centre of universal power . This is one reason why I contend that the suns of the // universe are the spiritual centres of the universe , and the abodes of Deity . He dwells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created things the intelligent or spiritual directing and controlling power is always at the electric centre of all force and power . This in the sun systems is the sun , as in our solar system , and here is the only natural reasonable abode of Deity and his arelcuigels . And it is also the only place in the known universe that could possibly cover the Bible description of heaven , a place where there is " no need of a sun , " or moon , and " where there is no night . " It is also the only place where gold and all precious stones are likely to be so abun ? data , that the walls of their cities are of jasper , and onyx , and rul , ies and pearls , and the streets are of gold . Where from the brilliancy of electric illumination there is the great white throne and him that sits thereon , so brilliant that no mortal can look upon his face and live , and the lakes glisten iii the brilliancy of the great electric illumination like seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the electric phenomena of its photosphere justify the conclusion that the sine is inhabitable , and presents the most heavenly conditions of life , it is a most reasonable conclusion , that it is the promised heaven of the good and faithful in our solar system . ' l'here God or his viceroy reigns in supreme beneficent power . In our solar system at its sun centre God the Father may be represented by Christ , the son and redeemer of men , while the Great Eternal Spiritual Father may dwell in the vast central sun Alpha Lyra , or Sires , or Alcyone ; suns many thousand times larger than our own and billions of miles distant from the earth . Here all the electric forces of the universe center , and converge and diverge , carrying their life-giving energies to every star and world . And there the Almighty Creator rules in supreme beneficence , // while electric and spiritual floods of light and life and joy sweep forth in mighty circles of resistless love and power . And from thence the invisible arms of electricity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach forth in their cycles of measureless strength and uphold the universe . Through these mysterious electrical forces he maintains the fearful velocities of suns and worlds , and holds all things in the grasp of his intellectual spiritual sovereignty . Thus , through the invisible electric nerves of suns and space he sees , and hears , and knows all things , and rules the universe as man , sees , and hears and feels , and rules his own limited universe , his transient earthly body . Christianity should not fear to localize the central dwelling place of God or heaven . That he has one none will question . And he gave us reason for the purpose that we might discover his laws , his dwelling place , and the nature and purposes of all creation . Man will finally learn all these things . Then the godlike in aspiration will attain to the godlike in knowledge , for there is no limit to the possible bounds of knowledge in God 's universe . And what we do not learn here , we will learn in the hereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal realm of perfect knowledge and perfect happiness , whether it be in the sun , Alpha Lyra , Alcyone or elsewhere . This is the field of pure speculation , but from such a field have come at length all the facts and demonstrations of science . If my hypothesis can not be demonstrated , the same is true of half the accepted truths of science ; and as suggestion and as theory is the initial step in the acquiring of knowledge , mine may lead some scientist to more closely investigate these untrodden fields . My conviction is positive reasoning from accepted scientific facts , that God rules the universe as man rules his // body ? by electricity . That his abode or dwelling place is at the seat of central electric power ? the suns ; that they are inhabitable and occupied by the highest orders of intelligent beings . That they are the promised heaven or place of perfection to the inhabitants of each solar system of worlds and planets , and the only places in the physical universe that fulfils the Bible description of heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on earth . The ( creeks made their gods dwell just above the clouds and made them descend to Mount Olympus periodically to discuss and take part in the affairs of men . The same is true of the Romans and Egyptians . Only the Hebrews and Christians worship a God of Omnipotence dwelling in the far-off realms of the universe . CHAPTER IX . MAN IS BEGINNING TO USE ELECTRICITY AS GOD USES IT TO BLESS AND CONTROL THE WORLD . ELECTRICITY has solved many of the great problems of human life , and opened a pathway of earthly existence that promises more than the Utopian dreams of the wisest philosopher . Franklin , Morse , Edison , Tesla and others have learned to control the mysterious and immeasurable energy that is the origin and sustainer of life upon the planet . They have harnessed the electric fires of the sun to do their bidding , and work at their command . They flash living thoughts around the world , they light and heat houses of luxury and turn the wheels of commerce . The discovery and utility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that it can drive every wheel that revolves , make the night as brilliant as day , and give to the poorest home the generous warmth and light that illumes the mansion of the millionaire . It has produced the telegraph , the telephone , the phonograph , the electric light , the X-rays , the dynamo , the electric motor and railway , and brought innumerable blessings to the race . Even now the public press are discanting on the wonderful invention of Edison which is to convert the motion of the waves of the ocean into electric power . He is to build works and machinery out at Sandy Hook , utilizing the action of the sea by which the great city of New York may be heated and lighted and its machinery propeled at nominal expense . And it is also stated that that other great genius , Nichola Tesla , has invented a machinery and process by which the 133 // sun 's rays can be focused and utilized to turn all the wheels of commerce and manufacture , and light and heat cities and towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each home lighted and heated . One will capture the forces that agitate the sea , the other extract from the rays of the sun the electric tbrces of light , heat and power that give life and energy to the solar system . Testa , who is now planning to build an immense sun plant on Long Island , says in the New York World , of December ii , 1897 , " As to the cost to the individual citizen of heat , light and power when generated by means of the rays of the sun I think in a few years it will be merely nominal . I should not be surprised if every large city in the world should have a number of electric stations of this kind completed in two years , and after first cost of construction had been defrayed by public tax , the mere cost of maintenance would place the individual heat and light at less per month than the price of a tern bushels of coal . Vast trouble the human race will avoid in using only a natural substance as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearly probable that the day is surely coming when no human being will be forced to do any kind of manual work . The time does not seem ( hr distant when man will be able to desist from all mere brute labor , and pass his whole life in contented enjoyment of the state of ' things brought about by his own ingenuity in harnessing the elements to his peculiar advantage . " Ile further adds , " Most people will contend that the plan to harness the rays of the sun to compel them to operate machinery of man and give light and heat is the idle fancy of a dreamer . I would indeed be surprised if they were to contend otherwise . There has never yet been proposed a single big scientific enterprise that has not at first been met with ridicule , and laughed at as being something beyond the bounds of possibility . It was so in the days of horse cars , when electric street railways were first // talked about as possibilities . 1t will be the same with the motive power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two months that the generating stations are in operation they will be places of interest , but after that the people will think no more about them except as business places . I am certain that the new apparatus will come into speedy and general use . Its cost is so insignificant it can not be ignored . " Thus speaks with assurance one of the two greatest electric inventors and geniuses of this marvelous age . Various experiments made with solar engines by the French in Algeria where the sun is never overclouded , and shines with great power , has been attended with marked success . The best apparatus is said to be a simple arrangement of boiler and concave mirror , the steam generated being condensed in a coiled tube surrounded by water , this being intended merely for distilling water . In India an inventor has contrived machines with which more varied results are accomplished . One of these , a cooking box is made of wood , and lined with reflecting mirrors ; at the bottom of the box is a small copper boiler covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rays upon the boiler . In this contrivance any kind of food may be quickly cooked , the result being a stew or boil if the steam is retained , and if allowed to escape , a bake . The heat with this device may be augmented indefinitely by increasing the diameter of the box . Thus it may be but a short time until the world will be cooking , heating and lighting , and running all the wheels of commerce by the use of the direct electric rays of the sun . But this is not all , surprising results in vegetable growth have been obtained by electricity , so that it may furnish the vegetables and food , beside furnishing the light and heat for cooking them . Experiments from government agricultural station // Amherst , Mass. , indicate that electricity is soon to do for the farmer , as much as it has done for the pampered urbanite . The idea that electric currents introduced beneath growing crops would materially hasten growth , and improve quality and quantity , has been a scientific belief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been devised . An invention called the geomagnetifere s u c - c e s s f u l l y tested at Amherst proves the theory correct . It consists of a pole fifty feet high surmounted by a crown of copper spikes . These spikes collect the electricity in the atmosphere and it is conducted by the poles into the ground , where wires buried five or six feet beneath the surface distribute it throughout the area of the farm . One pole sunk es for several acres , and entails no operating expense . Experiment shows that by the use of the geomagnetifere the product has been doubled . Radishes have been produced eighteen inches long and six inches in diameter . Pansies were made to blossom in a week , and roses in ten ilia ys . The color amid fragrance of flowers were greatly intensified . In short , nature by this electric device has been keyed up to double duty , without apparent hurt to lief itality . The saccharine yield of sugar beets increased thirty per cent. , and in the beet industry alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric light is also used for stimulating the growth of plants , and its effect has been to hasten the maturity of lettuce , spinach and similar products . But these experiments are just beginnig to be made on a large scale . Professor L. II . Bailey , of Cornell University , has been asked to go to Finland to conduct a series of experiments in electric plant growing in connection with Professor Lernstrom , of the University of I-lelsingfors . They have nothing to do with electric light , or the running of electric wires through the soil to force the growth of plants by direct current stimulation . They are to be // based on observations made by Lemstrom on the effect of the aurora borealis on the plant growth of the north . It is a well-known fact that plants of the north arrive at maturity in a much shorter period than those grown further south . This is necessary as the summer season there is brief , and it has been considered a wise provision of providence that they were enabled to accomplish their purpose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , science is rapidly discovering providence and electricity are nearly related . And so Professor Lemstrom thinks , for he discards the providential idea , and states the rapid growth of plants in the north is due directly to the light of the aurora borealis , and the large amount of atmospheric electricity which causes its presence . Lemstrom has been carrying on a series of experiments , and now in conjunction with Professor Bailey proposes to extend them on a larger scale , in the way of an electric farm of a decidedly picturesque character . It is proposed to erect a line of posts around this farm with wires stretched through the air at convenient distances . Small knobs or points will project . A static current such as produced by the Holtz machine will be sent over the wires , and will be allowed to jump across the open space between the wires from one point or knob to another . Thus a constant flow of electricity will be obtained , and the atmosphere saturated with the current . At night the scene would be very picturesque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire and from knob to knob , in a background of darkness , that would make it seem a fable farm from fairyland . Professor Bailey says , " Our contemplated experiments point the application of atmospheric electricity to the growth of plants . Lemstrom and myself have devised a scheme by which we are to work in unison ? some work to be carried on in Finland and some in America . I go to Finland to look over his experiments , by which he shows // the influence of the aurora on the atmosphere and plant growth , through the electrification of the atmosphere . Ile went to Spitzhurgen and investigated the electrical phenomena and the meteorology of plant growing . I have recently pointed out to the Massachusetts horticultural society the great effect which atmospheric electricity has on the growth of plants . Atmospheric electricity exerts a very powerful innucleic upon vegetation . The experiments of ( aramica n determined this point . Grandeau found that plants deprived of atmospheric electricity gave fifty to seventy per cent . less bulk and fruit than plants subject to normal conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eli shortly afterward reached similar results . So did Leclerc . But by far the best investigations were those made in Finland and France by Lemstrom , physicist in the IJniversity of IIelsingfors . His experiments showed thirty-five per cent . increase in the harvest , and greatly improved quality of the product . " The various uses of electricity are not yet exhausted . We have said it perli ) ? med the miracle of digestion and assimilation of food , the purification of the blood , adjusted the properties of the air to the needs of vegetable and animal lilie , and brought the healthful ozone from the skies . It would take a volume to enumerate the known uses of electricity . I will quote briefly from a recent lecture by Professor A ! last Woolf , of New York , on " Electric Purification . " Speaking of antiseptics , he said , physicians now use them with great doubt and hesitation . He said " In in a perfectly healthy body currents of electricity are flowing whose action upon the blood is the same as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water arrange themselves in polarity , and the current jumps from molecule to molecule , and electrolosis or decomposition of the water , is the result . It is necessary to take a certain amount of salt into the body . The electricity decomposes // the salt in the blood , and this is nature 's disinfectant , destroying disease germs . The disinfecting agent is ozone , or free oxygen which is produced by the electrolosis . Ozone produced in large quantities by the use of a dynamo , and tanks of salt water can be used as a disinfectant in any locality , at an economical cost , and is absolutely non-poisonous ; while the disinfectants usually employed , viz , carbolic acid , corrosive sublimate , or sulphuric acid ? are poisonous . " These statements he illustrated by several experiments , one by the electrolytic action of the current by the insertion of the two poles of a battery into some sea water . Decomposition of both the water and salt was produced , free-. ing oxygen , hydrogen , chlorine , and sodium , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbles could be seen passing to the positive and negative poles . By using a small quantity of this electrolized solution , Professor Woolf said , a very large quantity of water could be purified , or rid of germs , and by sprinkling it over fermenting matter like garbage heaps , all fermentation could be stopped . " The quick growth of electricity has in twenty years revolutionized trade , " says the New York Times . Its continuous " Marvelous progress has been made in the industrial application of electricity in recent years . It is little over twenty years ago since electric lights were first used commercially , now they are in almost universal use , and constantly increasing . " Long distance transmission of power is an element of much consequence in electrical industrial developments . Through this water power can be utilized in places hitherto inaccessible . Important water power plants have been erected at Niagara Falls , Montreal , Blue Lakes , and other places . There will soon be in operation at Massena Falls a plant of 75,000 horse-power . In the Pacific coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power has made it possible to work mines and industries , other-
