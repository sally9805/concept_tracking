txt It is a maxim in the courts that Ignorance of fact excuses ; ignorance of the law , which every one is bound to know , excuses no one . A railroad freight rate is manifestly a fact , but when fixed , published , and filed it is also a law , os which the shipper can be ignorant only at his peril . Railroad freight rates are laws because Congress hp ' made them so . Congress may itself establish and declare rates . As this would be impracticable , it has delegated the power to establish and declare Inter-State rates to an administrative commission . The commission may fix a maximum reasonable rate , it may also receive and place on its files the rates fixed by the railroads . When so filed that rate and that alone becomes the true and lawful rate . It is , in fact , a law . The statute declares it to be " unlawful for any person , persons , or corporations to offer , grant , or give or to solicit , accept , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? whereby any such property shall by any device whatever be transported at a less rate than that named in the tariffs published and filed by such carrier . " The giving or receiving of a rate less than the published and filed rate is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000 . That shippers who are ignorant , even Innocently ignorant , of the true and lawful rate nevertheless by accepting a Iess rate make themselves liable to punishment , appears not only from the maxim of law , but from Judge LANDIS 'S ruling in inflicting the fine of $29,240,000 upon the Standard Oil Company of Indiana The Traffic Manager of the oil company testified that he applied to " the chief rate clerk at the office of - the General Freight Agent of the Chicago &; Alton Company for the rate on oil from Whiting to East St. Louis . " In response to this application , made in December , 1902 , 1903 , and 1904 , he received " a document purporting on its face to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 cents per hundredweight in carload lots . He further testified that upon each occasion " he inquired of the rate clerk whether the rate had been filed , and was assured that it had . " As to this testimony , that the Traffic Manager had been misled into an " honest belief " in the validity of the 6-cent rate , Judge LANDIS remarked that " a jury is not required to accept an obviously improbable thing as true , merely because in a lawsuit a witness may testify to its having happened . " Again , the defendant oil company offered to show beat the Chicago &; Eastern Illinois Road had a rate on oil of 6% cents to East St. Louis , a fact tending to confirm its belief in the validity of the Chicago &; Alton rate This testimony was excluded as not being admissible on the question of guilt or Innocence , but the court examined the schedules of the Eastern Illinois Road , and pointed out that the rate In question , though fixed In 1903 , " was not filed with the Inter-State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expiration of the period covered by the indictment , and nearly three years after its issue . " Here again was ignorance , which could not excuse . The 61-ie-cent rate of the Eastern Illinois was not the lawful rate because not filed . The 6-cent rate of the Chicago &; Alton was not the lawful rate . The rate filed , and there- , fore lawful , was 18 cents . The defendant insisted that it had been misled into an honest belief . The court did not ask the jury to believe it . . Referring to the " doleful predictions " of , the harrlehips upon honest ? shippers to be expected from the enforcement of its ruling , Judge LANDIS said that " the honest man who tend ers a commodity for transportation by a railway company will not be fraudulently misled by that company " into the acceptance of an unlawful rate . ' That is comforting , but not a sufa reDance . A good deal depends upon the ? character of the shipper , who may be honest now , but may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal depends , too , upon the temper of the Judge . The only safe rule is for the shipper to make sure that the rate sheet he receives from the ? Traffic Manager is filed with the Commission at Washington .. That will cause trouble an , 4 delay , no end of trouble and delay , but fines and imprisonment are yet more troublesome .
