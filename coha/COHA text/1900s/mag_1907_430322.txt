 |p501  TO SEE Mrs. Deland in her home , surrounded by the flowers she has nurtured so carefully , is surely to see her at her best , and such a privilege is yearly accorded her fellowtownsmen , when she holds her annual " jonquil sale , " the proceeds of which she gives to charity . As one forsakes the world of frost and snow without , for the flowery realm within the charming home on Newbury street , Boston , where Mrs. Deland has lived since her removal from her former dwelling-place , on Beacon Hill , the transition seems truly a step from winter into midsummer . Entering on the ground floor , the visitor passes through the colonial hallway , with its carved settle and tall clock , and up one flight to the floor above where a glimpse into the dining room reveals much beautiful blue-and-white china peering through the glass doors of the protecting cabinets . The drawing room across the hall is , like the entire house , most characteristic of its occupants , tasteful , cheerful and hospitable ; with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls , and many books , it has an air of serene comfort . Leaving the cozy-corner near the fireplace , where one is tempted to linger for a season , the visitor mounts another flight of stairs to find Mrs. Deland herself in the midst of a wealth of brilliant blossoms , moving about her pleasant living room , flooded with winter sunshine . To find her thus with a background of flowers and sunshine is to find her surrounded by the two properties most thoroughly characteristic of her own happy nature , for she is preeminently one who brings into the house the free , bright spirit of the outdoor world . She is a handsome woman , in the prime of life , of medium hight , with frank blue eyes , warm coloring and a cordial bearing , which speaks at once of her wholesouled , enthusiastic temperament . For over twelve years Mrs. Deland has held these flower sales , which are eagerly patronized ; her scores of pots in bloom melting away as rapidly as snow before a torrid sun . While her exhibits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surpass all previous ones . More than two hundred pots containing daffodils , many varieties of hyacinths , narcissus and the old-fashioned daffadowndilly , as well as @#  |p502  tulips and crocuses , went to make up the exhibit ; bookcases , tables and every available space in the room that could contain a pot bloomed gayly . The flowerpots , which were of special pottery , of unconventional shapes and sizes , formed in themselves an interesting feature ; they were oval and square and some were made of soft , white clay . The love of flowers , and of a garden , has been since childhood a passion with this versatile woman , whose faithful devotion to these objects of her affection has made her one of the most successful floriculturists , both in city and country . Her first published volume , entitled The Old Garden and Other Verse , seemed an extension of her loved pastime into the field of poetry . Left an orphan at three years of age , Margaret Campbell was brought up by an aunt and uncle , who lavished upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood one must look for her knowledge of such a place as Old Chester . The village of Manchester , Pennsylvania , where these early years were spent , now hopelessly transformed by the encroachments of Allegheny , was , in the sixties , a place of dignified houses , pleasant gardens , and meadows sloping to the picturesque river . Here the imaginative child delighted to entertain her playmates with impromptu stories ; in her home she had the freedom of a good library , although there books of fiction were not allowed to be read without permission . It would be hard to find the exact Old Chester to-day , save in its creator 's imagination , though she receives many demands for its particular location by those who long to rest awhile within its peaceful harbor . While it is generally regarded a typical New England village , one is inclined to credit it with being after all , perhaps more characteristic of Old England . At all events , Mrs. Deland brought to its composition her vivid recollections of her Pennsylvania environment , modified by a veritable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New England limits , as she was a pupil at the Misses Bolton 's famous school , the Priory , at Pelham on the Sound . In this pretty corner of Westchester County , New York , two maiden ladies had set up their school , run on English lines , and so English in appearance that it much resembled its namesake , Bolton Priory , England . When , s @#  |p503  therefore , at sixteen , this ambitious young woman decided that it was time to seek an independent career , she emerged from an atmosphere which was more like that of the Old World , combined with those Pennsylvania associations which were more genial and less rigid in their character than were those from which Miss Wilkins drew her inspiration . She studied drawing and designing at the Cooper Institute , in New York , and , after graduating at the head of her class , won the appointment of instructor in design at the girls ' normal college in New York city . Here she remained until her marriage with Mr. Lorin F. Deland , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proved a thoroughly harmonious one , Mrs. Deland sharing her husband 's enthusiasms for the athletic world and he being in perfect touch with all her literary interests . Mr. Deland , himself an editor , printer and publisher , has been also particularly interested in the college world of sport ; he is a well-known authority on football , and Harvard owes him a decided debt of gratitude for his aid , both by personal exertions and by published work , in this direction . It was not until six years after her marriage that Mrs. Deland published her first volume of verse , which brought her ii - mediate recognition in the world of letters . Two years later came John Ward , Preacher , her first novel ; she was urged to begin this production by her friend , Miss Derby , who , having determined that it should be undertaken , carried Mrs. Deland three rearns of yellow paper , two bottles of ink and a dozen pens , and peremptorily ordered a novel . In speaking of this , her first piece of fiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsmere , its author said : " It was my idea of a love story , the highest kind of love which is willing to make its object suffer for what it believes to be good . " In one of Mr. Chesterton 's recent essays he has pronounced the " lack of conviction " the greatest of the dangers which threaten the present generation . Mrs. Deland is certainly refreshingly free from this fault . Sincerity and moral earnestness of conviction are dominant traits with her . She has a keen interest in all current affairs , and for all great movements of the day . Her train504 GOOD HOU  |p504  ing as a child was to a large degree theological . Her mother 's family stood for the Episcopal church , while her girlhood was passed in a strictly Presbyterian household , where religious topics were kept constantly before her . From the first , she has felt and shown in her work a horror of religious fanaticism and her attitude toward her fellow-beings has always been characterized by a broad and generous liberality . Particularly has her spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for twenty years she has done a splendid work for these . unfortunate sisters . Some critic has announced that there have been but two genuine creations in American fiction ? " Uncle Tom " and " Uncle Remus , " ? and while such a selection will at once awaken a clamor of dissenting voices , and the suggestion of other book personages , the addition of Dr. Lavendar to such a list would undoubtedly meet with a widespread and enthusiastic indorsement . For Dr. Lavendar is one of the " real folks " who are scattered so sparingly through the pages of modern fiction . Indeed , so real is he to those who have followed his beneficent career , that his creator has many demands for more exact data concerning him ; she The library , hung with foliage wall-paper in shades is , however , forced to disappoint the hopes of those who would seek him in the flesh by assuring them that after all he exists only in her imagination . There , assuredly , he is still very much alive , and she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow him to die , although I presume it must come sometime in the natural order of things . " How little does his modest creator realize that the power over the existence of Dr. Lavendar has long since escaped her ; he is already in his place among the book immortals . Seekers for this delightful country parson in the flesh have been told that he was suggested by Mrs. Deland 's uncle , the Reverend Doctor William Campbell . Those who knew this gentleman think they discern in Dr. Lavendar some of his characteristics ; others , who recall Mrs. Deland 's warm friendship for Phillips Brooks , find in the Doctor a certain likeness to that beloved preacher , of whom some picture may be found in almost every room of the writer 's home . While undoubtedly both of these suggestions contain some truth , the fact remains that Dr. Lavendar is Mrs. Deland 's very own , and like all the " real folks " in fiction is quite too much himself to be anybody else but Dr. Lavendar. of brown . Mrs. Deland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction of having created , not only a character like Dr. Lavendar , but a town , an achievement which Barrie perhaps alone shares among her fellow-craftsmen , and she has also triumphed over the danger which threatens every writer who deals repeatedly with any one place , or character ; that she has done this successfully is more than evident to those who have followed Dr. Lavendar 's career through her latest and greatest piece of work , The Awakening of Helena Ritchie , and who have found their interest in this old friend not merely sustained but increased . In this last and most masterly production , she has shown as she has done many times before , her remarkable knowledge of the heart and mind of a child . Indeed her understanding of the child universe is one of the most striking characteristics , and one hardly approached by any other modern writer . From the city home which Mrs. Deland occupies only during the winter months she goes to her pleasant suburban dwelling in Dedham , ten miles outside of Boston . Her summer home , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most closely identified , is at Kennebunkport , Maine . Here her flower-embowered cottage is an ideal retreat . When the Delands first chose this summer resting-place , it was a little fishing village and life there was of the most simple , primitive kind . A cottage was selected close to the river and Mr. Deland 's yacht , with its picturesque red Venetian sails , became a feature of the scene . A disused barn in a nook among the hills was found to possess a charming outlook and this was at once turned into a study in which Mrs. Deland did much of her literary work . Kennebunk has grown into a popular and populous summer resort since those early times , but the Delands pass their days in much the same fashion as when the sparkling river and the charm of the surrounding country seemed to belong to them alone . Whether Mrs. Deland is seen tending her garden at 5 o'clock in the morning , or wielding her paddle with ease and skill as she and her husband glide over the tranquil waters in their canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation and that her heart is in whatever occupation she puts her hand to . Be it as hostess , manipulator of the chafing dish , gardener , athlete , or in her literary work ,  |p506  there is never the least suggestion of halfheartedness or of ennui . Mrs. Deland comes of Scottish ancestry , on her father 's side being descended from John of Gaunt , and there is something about her of the freedom and strength of the Highlands . Her love of outdoor work and exercise , her splendid flow of spirits , all these characteristics go to the making of that sense of genuineness which pervades this writer 's work . In the performance of this she is very systematic , sitting down regularly at her desk and denying herself to everyone in the morning hours . At present Mrs. Deland has for a constant companion a picturesque canine pet . This is a " bob-tailed sheep dog , " a product of Mrs. Richard Harding Davis ' kennels . When Mrs. Deland takes this pet upon the street his woolly and tailless appearance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , see the polar bear ! " Those familiar with the writer 's charming volume of essays The Common Way , will smilingly recall her own words regarding , " loving my dog . " In this little book she has embodied much of that sincere and common-sense philosophy of living , of which she is , herself , such a refreshing , practical illustration . One feels that she has long since learned to free herself from the " tyranny of things , " has applied to her daily living her knowledge that the " necessities of life are spiritual rather than material , " and that she will never be called upon to answer for the twofold " waste of happiness " which she deplores ; that which comes from " unconsciousness of the possession of happiness , " and that which arises from " indifference to opportunity . " Margaret Deland , like her creations Old Chester and Dr. Lavendar , can not be claimed as the exclusive property of New England , and yet New England insists upon a share in each , and takes pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
