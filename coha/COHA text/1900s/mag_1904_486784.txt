Tradition has been broken . an accidental President has won a second term by popular suffrage , and the event is all the more remarkable because Mr Roosevelt was a Vice-President in spite of himself . This is the reward of having a positive character , a qualification usually the last to be ' considered in making Vice-Presidential nominations . It is also the reward of intervening actively and managerially in the conduct of the campaign , with all the advantages of the ins over the outs And if this be objected to on the score of taste it must be admitted to have been condoned by the vast majority of Northern voters , along with the Panama iniquity and all Mr. Roosevelt 's defections from his civil-service-reform professions His complete subserviency to partisanship has knit his party together , to such a degree that whereas he threw his official weight against Mr. Folk in Missouri , he received the electoral vote of that State while Folk apparently was elected ; and whereas Mr Roosevelt has made his bed with the most bigoted protectionists , in Massachusetts he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolt was handsomely made Governor In other words , the two , and only two , cheering local manifestations of independence  --  of the duty of a State to look after its own concerns and not to be drawn off by a concurrent Federal party contest  --  add nothing to the laurels of the victorious President . The multiplicity of issues enormously favored the party and the Administration on trial The Opposition sought to force the tariff to the front , but it can hardly be said that the Republican defence was anything but languidly concerned with that topic  --  hardly mole than the Democrats with the currency But , over and above this  --  above the attack on imperialism and on what ( in default of a better term ) we may call Mr Roosevelt 's Cmsarism  --  the predominant issue for the block of Southern States on which Mr Parker 's fortunes depended was Mr. Roosevelt 's assumed propaganda against caste and disfranchisement . The result was the most pronounced sectional alignment at the polls since the civil war , and Mr. Parker 's entire following after the engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race injustice This is , after all , the greatest lesson of Tuesday 's election The North has rebuked  --  indli ectly , it is true , but with sledge-. hammer emphasis  --  the childish attempt to degrade Mr. Roosevelt socially for one of the simplest , most natural , and most commendable acts of his life , at his own table , in his own house . No one can estimate proportionately the influence of the South 's behavior in magnifying defeat by reviving the old anti-slavery sentiment of the North , but it was real , and let who will read the moral of it . Senator Fairbanks solemnly " deplored " in Indiana the " personal charges " which Judge Parker had been making against the managers of the Republican campaign Such personalities were shocking to the Senator . Then , to illustrate his own scrupulous consideration for the feelings of political opponents , he gently reminded the Democrats that they were bent on disgracing the nation , ruining business , and driving every workingman into the poorhouse But neither he nor any Republican can deny the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spoken so pungently " Undue protection that riches may be unfairly acquired ; contribution of riches so acquired that undue protection may be continued and extended " ? that return of corruption upon itself can no more be doubted or explained away than the circling of the Pleiades . It is the serpent of protection twined about the Republican party with its tail in its mouth Everybody knows it . There is no concealment The very Republican newspapers Which grew black in the face denouncing the charges made against Mr. Cortelyou , admitted that , " naturally , great industrial enterprises and others which see that an administration of the nation 's affairs by the party which formally declares that protection is robbery would force them into bankruptcy , hare contributed to the Republican campaign fund " The President himself , in the letter forced from him by Judge Parker , admits that " contributions " have been made to his campaign fund by corporations . Less cautious than Mr. Root , he does not limit the admission carefully to " the managers of corporations . " And because no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lien upon Government privileges , Mr. Roosevelt asserts that there is no impropriety in such gifts of money , and that to imply it Is to slander the most high-minded President that ever lived ? as if the mere acceptance of money from a Trust is not all the guarantee the Trust needs . The President was absolutely silent about the strongest part Of Judge Parker 's charge , namely , that the " stand-patters " were pouring money into the Republican campaign fund in order that their tariff favors might be perpetuated and enlarged . That has alWays been the true gravamen of the accusation . The President practically confessed that the famous Bureau of Corporations was a humbug He denied that Mr Cortelyou had " any knowledge " about corporations " gained while in any official position " . And Mr Root , amplifying the confession in a later speech , declared that " neither the Department nor Mr Cortelyou nor the President had any information or secret of any corporation " that was not " common to all the world . " Indeed ' Then what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning ! It was to have been the instrument , in the hands of a determined President , for " crushing " every " bad " Trust It has beea triumphantly adduced again and again as proof of the honest purpose of Mr Roosevelt and tue Republican party to save the people from oppression by the Trusts By the terms of the law creating the Bureau , enacted as long ago as February 14 , 1903 , the Commissioner of Corporations was to have " power and authority " to make " diligent investigation " into the organization and conduct of corporations , and to " gather such information and data as will enable the President " to recommend to Congress laws to " i egulate " them A year and nine months pass , and Mr Root calmly explains that nothing has been done Why nor Why did not the Commissioner exercise the power conferred upon him by the statute to " subpoina and compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence " 7 Plainly , it is now admitted , because nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sham and deception from the first Mr Cleveland 's speech at Newark served the excellent purpose of again reminding men whose memories are short that tariff reform is the historic cause for which the Democratic party has fought Voters who have reached their majority since 1896 may have been misled by President Roosevelt 's round assertion in his letter of acceptance that the high-tariff policy should now be " ac cepted as definitely established . " The Democratic platform of 1884 attacked the tariff and promised revision ; an I ih fulfilment of that promise President Cleveland wrote his famous tariff message . In 1888 and again in 1892 , when the Democrats carried the day , the tariff was the dominant issue . In 1896 and 1900 the fear of free silver thrust this question for the moment into the background . But while the tariff remains what it is , an unjust burden on the consumer , a bulwark of monopoly , and the most potent cause of political corruption in America , some political party  --  if not the Democratic , some other  --  will maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest men should be directed to prevent the beginning of such a mischief , and to destroy it where unhappily it has been permitted to take root " If men should hold their peace about the iniquity of the tariff , the stones would cry out , One of the meanest Republican performances of tho late campaign was a deliberate personal attack upon Mr. Carl Schurz in a widely distributed " appeal to the Germans " with many well-known signatures attached Most of the men who actually signed it , we prefer to believe , did so as most people sign appeals and petitions  --  at the solicitation of friends and without stopping to read , and were ashamed to find that they had inadvertently appended their names to the statement that Mr. Schurz has " changed his politics as often as his residence , " and that he " only had to pocket the reward held out to him for his temporary fidelity to a cause or a party " We say madvenently appended , for no men realize be , cer than some of the signers we could name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what it coats him in abuse and misrepresentation We are glad to learn from the Staats-Zettung that a larg ' number of the alleged signers of the appeal deny having put their names to it , that others have written their apologies to Mr. Schurz , and that still others are keenly mortified at the position in which they have been placed by their own carelessness . There can no longer be any doubt whether President Roosevelt is truly ' Labor 's Friend " The fact is certified by T J Shaffer , president of the Amalgamated Association of Iron Workers He declared in the Labor World that it was " the duty of the working classes to support their friends " , and Codlin was the friend , not Short Shaffer adds , in order to show how true a friend of labor the President is " I firmly believe that President Roosevelt intends to knock on the head every illegal combination of capital there is in this country ' As proof of the entire disinterestedness of this endorsement , it is merely necessary to remark that Mr T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Commissioner of Labor At last we have an official explanation of Gov Odell 's object in becoming State chairman He said last week that he had " assumed these great responsibilities " solely to put down electoral frauds in New York city . " It was for this reason and no other " But what a splendid chance he had to add that , immediately after the election , he would resign the chairmanship , and , after January 1 , retire to private life Such a statement by him would at once have removed the load under which the Republican party in this State was staggering , and would have been worth many votes for Mr Higgins What frightens people is that Odell proposes to remain at the head of the Republican machine , and to manage it with the same tyranny and self-seeking that have made " Odellism " an offence to thousands of Republicans They dread it more than they do a Democratic victory in this State This he knows perfectly well Yet his personal crgan , the Newburgh News , goes on calling Republicans who dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand will be still heavier upon them in the future . The fact that he succeeded in carrying New York though Higgins lagged far behind the national ticket , confirms the threat Any one who has deplored the failure of the House of Representatives to assert itself will find pleasant reading in the spirited correspondence which has recently taken place between Attorney-General Moody and Congressman Augustus P Gardner of Massachusetts . The trouble arose over the postmastership at Haverhill The place is in Mr Gardner 's district , and he had made a selection for it , when suddenly he learned that Mr. Moody , who lives in Haverhill , had recommended to the President the retention of the present postmaster . This the Congressman very promptly resented He had yielded to the Attorney-General early in the summer in the selection of delegates to the National Convention , but insisted on his prerogative now . " It is not a parallel case in Massachusetts , " he said , " with ' those other States where the Senators select the postmasters " Precedent as well as natural right was on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a little later , " that when the Hingham post-office became vacant some years ago , the necessary recommendation was made by the local Congressman , albeit the Hon John D Long , at that time Secretary of the Navy , was a resident of Hingham " Mr Moody 's share in the exchange of letters is just 13 lines out of 250 , but it is to be recorded that he got the appointment . Saying nothing of the likelihood that the Federal fabric will come tumbling about our heads , the Congressman 's plight is pathetic enough . " Even after I have given out the facts , " he says , " I shall suffer a tremendous loss of strength among my friends , as human nature is so constituted that it seldom believes what a politician says . " Thus it would appear that skepticism , in Massa chusetts , broadens down from Lodge to his son-in-law , irreverently known as " Gussie " Gardner . The Supreme Court , Mr Justice White dissenting , has upheld the Wisconsin Anti-Boycott law The case was an uncommonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial , no issue of labor and capital being involved The Milwaukee Journal having raised its advertising rates , two rival papers refused to print the notices of advertisers in the Journal except at its rates , meanwhile promising a handsome rebate to Journal advertisers who should refuse to continue on the new basis In other words , inducements were offered to make the patrons of a rival newspaper resist its increase of rates The defence naturallv was freedom of contract It was held that every step in the transaction was lawful The defendants had a right to charge what they chose for advertising service , and the public , naturally , a right to profit by such competitive rate-cutting On this matter Mr Justice Holmes , for the court , held that freedom of contract did not extend to including provisions clearly ma icious ana injurious , while on the point of the innocence of acts which lead to a wrongful result he read the following very interesting opinion .

So far as we are able to observe , Mr Washington 's political activity has been limited to giving extremely good advice when he was asked for it If , however , it is meant by the charge that the best-known colored citizen of the South has declined to accept as final the suffrage conditions of his race to-day , we presume he must plead guilty But , singularly enough , the one allegation which has been made against him by men of his own color has been his failure 10 be more active on behalf of their political rights As a matter of fact , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire career , that he is primarily the head of a great school  --  one of the greatest in the United States , and that his first duty is to it . Even the leadership of his people , to which his natural abilities call him , is secondary to his duties as principal . For Alabama to deprive his school of its appropriation at the behest of its Heflins , would be a grave step backward , which could only injure the State and the er tire South by causing a widespread feeling of resentment among all who believe in education as a solvent of the problems of our democracy Fortunate-y , the Legislature does not meet again for at least two years , by which time the hotheads should have cooled off How this city 's expenditures have swollen since consolidation is evident from the new $110,000,000 budget , now officially adopted . In its first year , Greater New York cost $77,559,232 In seven years departmental expenditures have gone up nearly $62,500,000 This increase , however , can not of itself be set down as proof of extravagance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlay , than our worst Thus , Mayor Low 's last budget exceeded Van Wyck 's last by some $8,000,000 Mayor McClellan , on the other hand , has taken a firm stand for economy He has increased the budget only $3,880,000 ? probably just about enough , with the enlarged population , to keep the city going as It is The increase , it is estimated , will be covered by larger valuations for purposes of taxation , and a substantial growth in the general fund , so that there will be no material change in the tax rate Probably departmental estimates were never more ruthlessly cut down Proposals for wholesale salary increases have not been tolerated . Building Supei intendent Hopper , who planned to reform his bureau by raising everybody 's salary , has received no consideration Tenement Commissioner Cram , whose department has also been generally criticised , gets precisely what he had this year Commissioner ' Woodbury said that he could not properly do his woik unless he had $1,113,000 more , he gets $245,000 Commissioner McAdoo , in order to carry out his plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,000,000 , he must do the best he can with a quarter of that amount And so all along the line . Under Mayor McClellan the departments will not undertake much new work Indeed , the only large increases are in departments where the Board of Estimate has now little discretion . The two main items are nearly $2,000,000 for interest on the city debt , and $1,084,000 for the Board of Education , mainly to equip and man the twenty-six new schools and additions now under way Here again we see how one Administration influences the financial policy of its successor , for most of these sorely needed schools were authorized under Mayor Low Like the fabled sword victim , who , until the pinch of snuff was administered , could not believe his head was off , our New York public has waited for oxygen percentages before it felt it was being half-suffocated in the subway Au examination of the air in many stations shows that , except at City Hall the percentage of oxygen is so low as to be prejudicial to health This on the platforms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , science comes to explain the dull feeling in transit and the depression afterwards Assurances that the trains act like a piston are palpably false In the London Tube , where the train fits the tunnel within a foot or so , that is the case ; in our large four-track gallery a train presenting a " piston " surface of less than a quarter of the section merely stirs the air about The true figure is not a piston , but a churn , and passing expresses and locals no more draw in fresh air than a dasher , however vigorously worked , draws in additional cream Forced ventilation should ire mediately be introduced at all the subway stations A report of the British Consul at Panama speaks of " the virtual economic annexation of Panama " by the Americans He shows how our first interpretation of the treaty took over not only the canal strip , but all of the cities of Panama and Colon except " two small patches wedged in at the two extremities of the American zone " And the rigid and precipitous application of Dingley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give American exporters a great advantage , but to ruin the trade beyond the border It is no wonder that the real Panamanians protested against the complete surrender of their rights by their pro-tempore Minister at " Washington , the discredited Bunau-Varilla . Before going to the country , Premier Global broke the long-standing alliance with the Socialists  --  the connubto , as the Italians love to call it ironically ; and though he has been reelected with all his ministers , the sources of his majority in the new Parliament are not yet apparent The Extreme Left , whose strength has been reduced , by estimate , from some ninety to about seventy seats , will unquestionably be in Opposition , and the Government will have to make up this loss from the relatively conservative groups of the Right That is , a majority already sufficiently composite must take on still another incongruous element , or fail altogether  --  a fact which explains the curious spectacle of a .

Indeed , the value of that fortress is chiefly naval . The only reason for pressing the siege would be a serious attempt to send the Baltic squadron around The strategy of Tokio finds its sole justification in the tremendous moral effect that the fall of Port Arthur would have upon the populace of Russia and the chancelleries or the world That effect Nogi will probably have bought too dearly .
