 | IT has been said that England is the garden-spot of Europe , and Oxford the garden-spot of England ; this may be true , for Oxford is about as beautiful as one can conceive . The beauty , however , is tame and civilized ; there is no rugged.nature , as yet undefiled by human touch ; no wild scenery , laughing to scorn the conceited attempts of man . Oxford is a quiet , beautiful , prudish spot and appropriately in it is situated a quiet , beautiful , prudish university ; a university steeped and fossilized in classic lore a university of five hundred years ago , externally altered to suit the needs of a vigorous , but non-demanding youthful generation . Oxford and the university ? the two fit exactly together . Because of its steadiness and conservatism thru all its history , all its excitements of changing centuries , all its vexatious troubles of superstitious ignorance , religious revolutions and persecutions , despotic sway and wilful authorities , because  | of these Oxford is the city most suitable for a sturdy , steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained standing firm by the ancients , changing as little as possible , reluctantly adding the new branches of study as discoverers and promoters pointed out and developed them . Today we find Oxford proudest by far of the universities of the world in her lore in Greek and Latin , ancient philosophy and history . Rightly is Oxford proud of her learning . The intellectual center of the world it is ; the center of cobwebbed learning , of dust-stained classics . We are glad it is so , and in all probability will remain so . Fortunate indeed is he who can taste of old Oxford , who can live a medieval life in a modern way , a modern life in a medieval way , who can imbibe traditions , and customs , and knowledge from the fountain-source of centuries of cultured life and inculcated learning . Fortunate is he , who , standing on the scene of the event . can imagine an unflinching Cranmer martyred for his persuasions , an Empress Maud stoutly defending her castle on the Thames , a pious Wesley working out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewdly planning in St. John 's College a pompous and powerful life . But fortunate above all are the Rhodes Scholars , men who can live in this quaintly modernized place and drink in long drafts of its custom , history , and knowledge for three long and yet fleeting years . It is not to be expected that Oxford will be found an up-to-date rustling university like one of our own country . In Oxford is found a delightfully entangled congregation of colleges , governed by its graduates , hoary-headed sticklers for precedence . As each generation graduates , and , by reason of its Masters ' degrees , becomes a part of the working machinery of its Alma Mater , it in turn becomes a set of hoary-headed sticklers for precedence . Thus changes come slowly ? if at all . This is right ; we would not see Oxford modern ! It will be a day long mourned by all true Oxonians when from the Statute Book are erased the foolish but ancient rules ; when that much-abused , short , loose gown with its two plaited straps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | embodiment of long ago , the antiquated don , who so patiently struggles to enlighten in the lore of Greece and Rome your non-classical mind , would be to lose Oxford itself . No . Oxford must remain as it is . Today in most countries we find the leading universities more and more tending to confine and relegate the learning of the ancients to a school which is apart and distinct from all others ; in many universities entrance requirements no longer include Latin and Greek ; German , and French , and mathematics are taking their place . Not so in Oxford . She still sleeps . She still compels every member of her body to know his Plato and his Virgil . Last year some presuming moderns suggested the elimination of Greek as an entrance requirement to the university . Oh , vanity of vanities ! Oh , presumption of presumptions ! The loyal hoary-headed sticklers for precedence were not betrayed ; Greek still exists as a study compulsory to admission . Again , we find that most universities have developed strong technical courses and schools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education to such a degree that they have infused new life into their nation , encouraged invention , and fostered independence of other peoples . Oxford has not developed these branches ; she has reluctantly admitted them into her curriculum , but that is about all ; she does not encourage them to an appreciable degree ; she has not practicalized her education . All that Oxford teaches is by no means useful ? in a practical sense ; some few things she teaches for customs ' sake only , other few because exigencies demand them ; the majority she teaches merely for knowledge 's sake . Oxford takes a youth fresh from the public school and plunges him into a chaotic mass of highly ideal knowledge ; she turns him loose into this common-sense and prosaic world , if possible to practicalize the knowledge he has gained ; if impossible , to acquire a new practical and necessary education . An Oxford graduate has still to fit himself for this real world of struggles and bard-gained prosperity . In short , Oxford does not fit her students for their life-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , then knowledge for the sake of practicability ? the opposite of the natural order of things ? In the United States the universities reverse this . There practical knowledge first , later ideally conceived knowledge , is found . There a man is first fitted for his life-work , then turned loose to build upon the foundation he has laid a confineless structure of ideal knowledge ; after a student has received a practical education , he is allowed to wander at will in the Elysian fields where knowledge for knowledge 's sake quintessentializes every flower and blade of grass , every thought and every act . I can not , however , condemn the Oxford system . It has its advantages , and is obviously the proper one for that university . Consider what class of men go to Oxford , and for what they go there . Because of the enormous expense it is impossible for a poor man to attend Oxford . One part of the undergraduates there belongs to the aristocratic class , another to the wealthy class ; a third part to the ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Oxford on scholarships and exhibitions , or on stinted incomes ? the last usually for research work . Men of the two first classes do not have to think of making a living in future days , they are provided for ; men of the last , if doing research work , it is to be presumed that they already have obtained a practical education ; if on scholarships , it will be found , in most cases , that they have specialized on some one subject already ; if on exhibitions , they have nothing to justify their being in Oxford except great and powerful ambitions . These facts granted , it is found that a truly practical education , is not demanded of Oxford ; only part of one class requiring to be fitted for life-work . Demand creates existence ; were there a sufficient demand for truly practical education in Oxford she would be compelled to install it . Why then should Oxford emphasize science and technical knowledge ? Let England establish . universities of that sort in other places ; for , of course , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; make those universities entirely of that sort if  | necessary ; but leave Oxford antiquated . If not to the advantage of England , it certainly is to the advantage of the world that this center of ancient learning remain active in its characteristic branches . But it may be argued that Oxford does fit men for the professions , and that all undergraduates there intend a profession . can only grant that it lays a foundation for a profession such as can be obtained at no other place in the world . If , in his profession a man depends upon his Oxford training he depends upon a narrow education , and altho it may be valuable , it is not always useful , for Oxford teaches valuable but not always useful knowledge ? useful from a practical point of view , I mean . Oxford does not only neglect the scientific side of its resident student , it also neglects the literary . The English Literary School , while it is rich in the professors and lecturers it has , still possesses too few of them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a university like Oxford ! The work in English is not pushed . In the weekly essays which men have to write in most of the schools , the style of the writing , the choice of language , the balance of sentences , the sequence of thoughts , are almost entirely ignored ; the matter is the all-important to an Oxford don ; if the facts are there the language matters not . To this is due the fact that tho we find good , deep thought , and perhaps originality in the written production of an ) xonian , we scarcely ever fail to notice that the thoughts are not logically arranged or clothed in well-chosen language . Professor Firth has deplored the lack of literary training in the History School in these words : " The literary side of the young Oxford historian 's training has been almost as defective as the scientific . . The school produces few historians and few genuine students in history . " But Oxford is experiencing a slight touch of modernism . Dr. Osier in the Medical School , Professor Walter Raleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School , and others , seem to be trying to modernize and practicalize and extend the work in each they desire to make it more useful and productive of worldly-able students . Then there are the Rhodes Scholars in Oxford . What influence they have or will have can only be surmised , but it is certain that they have and will have some decided influence . Again , the present generation in England seems more energetic and more inclined to take lessons from other nations . I believe that eventually the Oxford educational system will be modernized and modeled to suit the exigencies of the day , but I am certain that in no other way will Oxford change . Still it will be the sturdy conservative university ruling its decrees by the laws of the ancients , in the vicissitudes of time consulting past centuries . Oxford University itself is one big conglomeration of paradoxes ; its religious tone is paradoxical , its government is paradoxical , and its methods of education arc topsy-turvy . And yet out of this incongruous mass come men able and eager to grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong and glorious nation well in the van of civilization . The government is indeed queer , and , were it not for its antiquity , we should call it absurdly ludicrous ; as it is there is much at which one feels inclined to smile . Here are twenty-one colleges and four or five halls , each entirely independent of the other and each virtually complete in itself in the " Schools " of the university . One college may be particularly strong in the classics , another in history , a third noted for its attention to science . One may be composed almost entirely of Welshmen , another of English " bloods , " a third may contain a preponderance of Scotchmen . But most of the colleges are strong in all schools , and cosmopolitan in students . The university has little or no power over these separate corporations ; it prepares and sets examinations , looks after the performance of ceremonials , and runs the libraries and museums . But each college governs itself , how and as it pleases . On the university statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitum , numberless customs which must be regarded , even tho at the expense of much valuable time ? and occasionally money ? ceremonials to perform and traditions to be followed . At the head of the university is a Chancellor , a nobleman , who is appointed for life ; a fine figurehead . He visits the  | university once a year ? twice or three times , perhaps , if he feels so disposed ; at Oxford he dons his scarlet gown and presides at a meeting or two , dines with the Vice-Chancellor , then returns to his home . The Vice-Chancellor is appointed by him , but even this is done by custom , for the head of a college who ranks in seniority of service to it is appointed . The Vice-Chancellor has great , almost unlimited , lowers over university and city , which , however , custom and tradition forbid him to exercise . The ruling of the university lies in certain councils and assemblies whose exact statuses are difficult of comprehension . But despite all this confusion and red tape and congregations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as smoothly as well-oiled machinery . It is a wonderful mystery how all the cogs and springs and bands are kept in repair and working in apparent harmony . In the social life , too , there appears to be an incongruity ; for it is not conducive to study and is conducive to much that prevents study . An Oxonian 's day can well be divided into lecture periods , athletic hours , periods for social intercourse at luncheons , teas and coffees ; the spare moments are filled with reading and study . But here , again , Oxford can be justified by reason of the class of men who make up her student body . One is not expected to work much during term times , he is to take lectures , attend to his tutorial hour ? one a week ? and to absorb the culture and the spirit of Oxford ; during vacations he is expected to study diligently . This scheme is possible because of the fact that largely the leisured class attend Oxford ; they have plenty of time in vacations to read widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings to Oxford th learning which has been bor .. in him down thru generations he brings the culture which has been bred in his vcr. bones ; he brings the scholar ' : instinct which he has had tin- - to cultivate by the unr strained use of a manv-volumed paternal library , and by association with scholarly men . These things contribute to make up that so-much-talked-of spirit which men are told incessantly to absorb while in Oxford . This spirit is one of the great benefits to be derived from this old university . While it is not tangible or visible , nevertheless it is a living reality , and altho it can not be named or described , vet it exists truly , and its potent force can be readily felt . It is a subtle influence which enthuses one and gives him that true love of knowledge which at once marks him as a scholar . It wears down rough positiveness , softens the severity of prejudicetl criticism , cultures and refines thoughts ? intellectual thoughts at least . Another element productive of this spirit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Oxonian . Nowhere is this shown so well as on the athletic field ; here the Englishman shows , in its best form , that which is the essence of manliness , love of justice to all , fair play . On the field are no wrangling or disputes with the referee ; the Oxonian has chosen his referee , therefore he abides by the decisions of that official ; when an unfair  | decision is made there is no immediate uproar , nor is the referee howled at ; the Oxonian simply comments quietly to the effect , perhaps , that the referee has misjudged or has made a mistake , then he goes ahead and plays the game . If beaten , he contents himself with the fact that he did his best and lost at a fair game . If he wins , he knows he has won fairly and in a gentlemanly way . He plays the game as hard as he can , but never stoops to " dirty work " in order to win ; he has no desire to win at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fair play , if he can ; if he can not , then he loses in fair play after a hard-fought struggle . Ile admits frankly when he has met his better ; he does not try to excuse himself when beaten . Thus the Oxonian plays a clean and hard game and indulges in true sport . Paradoxical as it may seem , I believe : hat the careless way of the Oxonian also contributes to that famous Oxford spirit . The Englishman knows how to live . He accomplishes what he can with comfort and without sacrifice of health ; he does not slur over things in order merely to finish them . When he has so much work to do , he does it thoroly but at his convenience . The Oxonian takes time to read the papers and interest himself to some extent in politics ; he takes time also for the reading of general literature ; he will not sacrifice the pleasures of goodfellowship , he must have his pleasure times . But he is not wholly slack , he improves the moments he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind at any time he desires . He never entirely tires out his patience , his mind , or his body ; he exercises all , but never to excess . How this easy way of living conduces to encourage the Oxford spirit is in this wise : it stimulates the mind and body to healthy activity , never to feverish energy and sickening surfeit ; it instils a love of knowledge which in later years produces accurate scholarship . However , the careless way also has its disadvantages ; to a thoughtless youth it begets laziness and neglect of work , it makes of him a contented dolt or a worthless , quiet pedant . Further , this carelessness is liable to run into both smaller and greater faults , into inattention to manners , deterioration of thought and care of others , into vitiation of morals , disregard of religion , loss and abandonment of ambitions . Hence the saying that Oxford either makes or mars men . In the purely educational way there are two conditions in Oxford which are eminently admirable , the tutorial system , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first is admirable because of the value of personal contact , association with an intellectual superior . Even an hour a week is invaluable ; for the student is then not only shown his errors and shown why they are errors and what is right , but also he is forced to defend his own views or stand selfcondemned of shallow or total lack of thought . Personal instruction can not be too highly estimated . The tutor assigns work , the student is dependent upon himself to accomplish it . He is very independent , for he has few set books to  | study ; his tutor guides him in his work and advises him ; the tutor feels responsible for the class which the student under him obtains in the examinations , which are two or three years in the future to the Freshman . The tutor does not rebuke him for lack of work except in extreme cases . The student has no marks credited to him which mean either success or failure , he is responsible only to himself . This independence of work leads to originality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas concerning his work , to a knowledge of books and how to use them . This last , by the way , is extremely important in the United States , where the essence of knowledge is of greatest importance ; where general facts are striven after to the neglect of details ; where the ruling idea is to know a subject in the skeleton and know where readily to find the " fill out " and detail knowledge . These then are a few of the impressions which I have received in more than a year 's residence at Oxford . It is the duty and the privilege of every Rhodes Scholar , I believe , to observe and mark the best things in Oxford . A very few of these I have given here . The faults which are noticeable in Oxford should interest an American who is residing there in three ways : first , in so far as they are paralleled in his own country ; second , in so far as they help to show up the good points ; third , in so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insure avoidance of them in the United States . In the faults I have pointed out here I have kept in mind these three assertions . I have stated facts as I believe them to exist ; I have spoken for myself only , and if anywhere I have referred to the Rhodes Scholars as a whole , I have not by that meant to assert their views , but simply my own . I do not wish it to be thought that I am representing any consensus of opinion . There is current in America an idea among many , even of our educated men and women , that three years spent at Oxford are three years thrown away : that Oxford furnishes an education which is not only worthless but even deteriorates the American who acquires it ; that it produces effeminate men and turns Americans into deplorable half-breeds . The only remark needful to be made upon this is , that such people have not been at Oxford and are unacquainted with Oxford education ; are they in position to judge ? There are other people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because of this will prove less staunch and valuable citizens of the United States . There is nothing less likely to occur . Mr. Rhodes ' statement that the more the Rhodes Scholars see of other countries the better citizens of their own they will become is being proved true . Three years ' residence at Oxford is invaluable , and fortunate is he who can obtain it . I can not express my feelings upon the subject better than has already been done by one Rhodes Scholar : I am glad to be at Oxford .
