The Week . The time-worn question , " What constitutes a State ? " is much in order in the case of the bantling Republic of Panama . It has a self-appointed triumvirate , and an incipient diplomatic service named by three consuls . It has no discoverable Constitution , no legislature ; and what its judiciary is , let who knows answer . Clearly , some of the usual appurtenances of a State are lacking . Apparently there are more diplomats than soldiers or judges ; and this suggests the thought that when M. Bunau-Varilla tells the Czar of " the end which the obvious intentions of Providence have assigned " to the State of Panama , he means the capacity to make treaties Evidently , the Republic of Panama has no other reason for being ; and if it be a sufficient entity for treaty-making purposes , it could only superfluously burden itself with the minor accessories of nationality . In any case , it seems in no haste to do so . To the pundits in international law we must refer the unique case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Government that is merely a foreign-office . Oh " republican form of government , " What side-splitting jokes are committed in thy name ! The Panama " commissioners to negotiate a treaty " are Confronted , on their arrival in Washington , with a treaty already signed . The whole thing was done between luncheon and dinner . At one o'clock the Secretary of State had not got beyond the preliminary question whether there was need of a new treaty at all ; by six , everything was signed , sealed , and delivered , amid " hearty congratulations . " The commission to negotiate is now to he transformed into a commission to ratify . Why not ? The only real credentials of the commissioners are , like those of Cardinal Ximenes , nothing but artillery  --  the guns , in this instance , being on our warships . There is surely no need of waiting for Panama to frame a Constitution and form a government . A Panama Senate might conceivably object to a treaty alienating the sovereignty of a strip of land ten to twenty miles wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the treaty " ratified " before there was any Panama Senate . As for waiting for the Panama commissioners , it was obviously much easier to deal with one man than three , and he , being a Frenchman , would , plainly , have a facility greater than any native 's in giving away their territory . Indeed , our State Department never displayed greater resources . There was an awkward hitch , for a moment , over the seal of the Republic of Panama , which it was necessary to affix to the treaty . There was no seal , any more than there was a republic But a clerk came gravely forward with " an improvised seal " which he had thoughtfully provided Improvised republic , improvised seal . What could be neater " ? It is not surprising that Wall Street should have begun to discuss with -a good deal of interest the manner in which the " Panama payment " will be made , and the effect , of such payment on the markets . As matters stand , our Government is bound to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French shareholders in the Panama enterprise , and $10,000,000 more to the Isthmian State conceding the canal . On the face of things , this would appear to mean the " laying down , " on a given date , of $50,000,000 at Paris and Co16n . If shipment of such a sum were to be made in actual cash , a question of very great interest would arise , as to Whether the cash sent out of the country would be obtained from the Treasury vaults or from the money market . It might be drawn from either , for , in addition to the $144,000,000 actual cash in the Treasury 's own hands , the Government has $159,000,000 on deposit in banks and subject to demand . If only the idle cash in the Treasury vaults were used for the Panama remittance , no disturbance would occur in the money market If , on the other hand , the banks were required to send $50,000,000 gold abroad , the money market would naturally be much upset . - But the situation is not as simple as this description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , has $144,000,000 actual cash on hand . But of that sum , upwards of $10,000,000 is in the form of uncoined silver and fractional coin , while the balance is held against $100,000,000 demand liabilities of the Government , in the nature of outstanding checks , disbursing officers ' credits , national bank redemption fund , etc . It may be doubted whether the Treasury could with propriety draw as much as $50,000 000 out of this working fund . What it probably will do , is what it did when the $20,000,000 Philippine indemnity had to be paid to Spain in 1899 . It drew almost equally on the Treasury 's cash reserve and its bank deposits . The proceeds were invested in London drafts , to mature in sixty days . These drafts were remitted to the Spanish Government 's agents , who could have held them until maturity , or turned them at once into cash at the European discount houses . If this country 's accruing foreign credits , at the moment , had been large enough , the $20 , - ' 000,000 charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by shipments of wheat or cotton or securities . As the matter actually fell out , however , the New York market , when- the bills matured , sent to Europe almost exactly $20,000,000 gold . A fine moral crescendo appears . in the reasons which the State Department is reported to have given for being against the annexation of San Domingo . In the first place , annexation has not been offered ; second , we should be unwilling to annex a country of which the majority of the inhabitants are against A ( please do n't utter the word Philippines  --  that has nothing to do with the case ) ; third , San Domingo has nothing that we want . True , we used to want Sa-mana Bay consumedly ; but our war vessels draw so much more waiter than they did in the seventies that the harbor would now be of little use to us . Not really needing San Domingo , therefore , law and morals forbad our seizing it . If , however , it should in the future appear vitally necessary to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we might discover that Samana Bay " commanded " or " frowned " upon something , and- we should have to take it and let a contract . An appropriation of money by Congress is to be - asked for to- prolong the existence of the Commission on International Exchange . The reasons for it ought to be found in the Commission 's report of its recent labors in Europe . We there learn that our envoys gained the ready assent of the Powers to the proposition that it would be a wise thing for China to adopt a monetary system " based upon what is commonly called the gold-exchange standard . " This phrase , being new to economic science , is defined in the report as " similar to the plan recently adopted by the Congress of the United States for the Philippines . " ' If the plan referred to is carried out without mistake or peradventure , it is the gold standard pure and simple , since it provides that the Philippine Government shall redeem its silver pesos in gold on demand of the holder , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The approval of the European gevernments iv-as easily gained for the extension of the gold standard to other silver-using countries on the same terms , So they bade our commissioners godspeed , who thereupon came home and reported that their work had been entirely successful . They were able to give China the joyful news that no European country would put any obstacle in the way of - her adoption of the gold standard . Now the question arises whether this missionary enterprise ought to be prosecuted any farther at public expense . Other American missionaries in China are supported by private contributions , and it would be difficult to assign a reason why Congress should make an appropriation for the C. I. E. and not for the A. B. C. P. M. The Commission on International Exchange sets forth at great length the difficulties of accomplishing the:monetary reform contemplated for China . , Yet it thinks that the plan would work well " provided proper business judgment be employed " ? i. e. , by the Empress Dowager and her subordinates in Peking . No compensating advantages to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition , except a probable increase of trade resulting from a better monetary system in China . As this would be shared by other countries , it would seem fitting that they should share also in the expenses of the expedition . If asked to do so , ' they would perhaps reply that they have-their- own diplomatic channels Of communication , which enable them to make any suitable representations to the Chinese Government in -a more regular way and without extra cost . So have we , and why should not our embassy be used to that end if it be a desirable one ? If any other man than Mr. McCall had said what he is reported as declaring on Thursday in the House , he would have to pay a severe penalty . His independent course as a Republican in the past has given him a prescriptive right to say and do about what he pleases ; but there is a limit to everything . Certainly , from a party point of view , it was most improper for him to stand up in Congress and state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the price of sugar in this country , and that consequently the Cuban planter would get the benefit . That may be his opinion , and it may be a very sound one , too . But it is not the one with which the Sugar Trust has favored the people of this country in the past . It told - us that a reduction in the duty on raw sugar ( the differential on the refined being retained , of course ) would cheapen the price of the finished product to domestic consumers . It was pretty hard for some of us to believe that the Trust was going to share the profit from the decreased duty with its customers , and now Mr. McCall rises up and tells us that it will cost us as much to sweeten our coffee as before . His view is , of course , the common sense one . The Cuban planter will benefit by reelProcity , and so will the Sugar Trust , as long as it retains the differential of which we have advocated the removal . The House did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Sugar- Trust lost - interest in the treaty . Now it is getting its own again . Mr. John ? Sharp Williams of Mississippi , the Democratic leader in the House , in the able speech in which he closed the debate on the Cuban bill argued convincingly that the prosperity of this country is not due to the Republican tariff policy . He showed that the country would in the long run be prosperous , no matter what tariff policy was adopted , although , as he believed , the fewer the restrictions upon trade the greater would be the prosperity . He pointed out what were the causes that insured prosperity here , saying , among other things , that the United States " will continue to be prosperouS because we are the one people on the globe , except some of bur - British cousins in the colonies , where there is absolutely no caste , where a man knows that although he is working to-day pegging shoes , he may the next year be Governor , or something of that sort . Men work with hope and with incentive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which the eloquent gentleman comes , be as prosperous as it might otherwise be if 900 , - 000 of its people , constituting nearly 60 per cent . of its population , can not " work with hope " in the sense in which Mr. Williams uses the phrase , simply because they are colored ? Speaker Cannon has had the unhappy experience of seeming more strenuous than the President . In the conference on the Cuban reciprocity bill , Mr. Cannon roundly characterized the postponement of the Senate vote as unfair treatment of the President ; and , in fact , no better reason has been alleged for deferring the bill except that the Senate wishes to " put the President in a hole , " by showing that the extra session was superfluous . The President , however , realizing the possibilities of obstruction in the Senate , took his " rebuke " lying down and assented to the delay . His surrender is unfortunate , for his case was a good and a clear one . Had the Senate proved obdurate , it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to that accumulating unpopularity from which alone reform of its antiquated procedure will come . In this case delay by the Senate is a kind of perfidy . That issue should have been fairly made . Having ratified the Cuban treaty , the Senate was , though not legally , yet in honor , bound to pass the enabling act promptly and as a noncontentious measure To pass the treaty and then boggle over the legislation necessary to make it effective , is a bit of child 's play . The case shows'plainly how little public considerations weigh against the personal prejudices and small maneuvring of the Upper House . Speaker Cannon deserves everybody 's thanks for being more zealous than the President in the President 's fight . Fear that New York- State will go Democratic in the next election is written on the countenance of every Republican politician . The victory of- McClellan in Manhattan and Brooklyn , in spite of many Democratic votes against him , indicates that when the full party strength is enlisted , New York city may easily roll up a majority of 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Republican ' leaders will have the struggle of their lives , for Odell carried the State for Governor by less than 9,000 . These facts alone are enough to account for the eager buzzings in the corridors of the Fifth Avenue Hotel , and the anxious look on every face in the Amen Corner . But , to add to the excitement , the relations between Platt and Odell are apparently more strained than ever . The Senator wants to retain his old sway over the organization ; and the Governor has long since discovered that a man can not retain his self-respect in office and at the same time do the bidding of Platt . The Governor , then , has cut out for him the task of holding Platt in check and keeping the State in line . Walking the tightrope is , in comparison , an easy amusement . The performance will be watched with sympathetic interest by political equilibrists all over the country . The Platt organs have been expressing their sincere compassion for Mr. Odell , and their fear that such a mere tyro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible that this is the interpretation to be put on the conciliation meeting at the White House , from which both emerged with smiling faces for the reporters . Prof. John Spencer Bassett of Trinity College is said to have tendered his resignation because of the criticisms evoked by his recent article in the South Atlantic Quarterly , of which he is editor , entitled " Stirring up the Fires of Race Antipathy . " From the Northern point of view it was a fair and forcible appeal for justice for the negro . From the Southern standpoint it was revolutionary , not only because it leaned towards race equality ( that is , equality of opportunity ) , but also because Professor Bassett declared that Booker T. Washington was the greatest man the South has produced in a hundred years , with the exception of Robert E. Lee . This opinion has aroused a perfect storm of indignation and resent -- meat , particularly in the sanctums of such rabid anti-negro newspapers as the-Raleigh News and Observer . Ministers have threatened to withhold their support from the college and parents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration for the interests of Trinity College , has offered his resignation to the trustees Two years ago , it will be remembered , the trustees of Emory College in Georgia turned away Mr. Andrew Sledd , their professor of English , for daring to express unconventional views ( for a Southerner ) upon the race problem , in the Atlantic Monthly This action was universally condemned throughout the ' college world and by the best representatives of the American press But Southern Bourbonism learns nothing and forgets nothing . Some time ago we called attention to the Ohio statute that makes any county , in which a lynching occurs liable for damages to the estate of the victim It was thought by some that there would be few actions under this law , not only because lynchings in Ohio are rare , but also because the victims are generally outcasts . But the " heirs , administrators , and assigns " of one Charles W. Mitchell , who was lynched in Urbana in June , 1897 , have just obtained a verdict of $5,000 against Champaign County , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county are not all pleased by this judgment , and are paying for the misdeeds of the Urbana rioters with extremely wry faces . It is safe to say that they will look with very little leniency upon similar pleasures of the mob in the future . The Illinois State Journal thinks this Ohio idea a very good one , and hopes that it will widely spread . In view of the lynchings at Belleville and elsewhere in Illinois , that State ought to be one of the first to follow Ohio 's lead . The State Journal , however , calls attention to the South 's need of such legislation , with the flippant remark that " it would doubtless be opposed there on the ground that it would deprive the people of a source of innocent amusement . " Senator Hanna naturally had a sympathetic audience as he preached ship subsidy to the Marine Architects and Naval Engineers last Friday . His contribution to a well-worn theme was not strikingly original , but he dropped at least two hints of interest . first , the recent Ohio election was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any campaign of education for a subventioned auxiliary navy must " begin in the House . " Senator Hanna went about during the campaign against Tom Johnson telling the farmers of Ohio that , should we be caught again in a war , without an auxiliary navy , their grain " would rot in their granaries . " This was very literally talking rot to them . For the post-prandial hour , vague generalities about " the flagon every sea " and the " third line of defence " do very well But if ever the campaign of education which Senator Hanna so ardently desires is to begin , it must be conducted on a basis of facts and figures . If the navy needs auxiliary ships and crews , let us have an estimate , not from a dealer in shipbuilding ma'terials , but from a naval board . In that way we shall learn how many ships are wanted , and what it is worth to retain them . We may also hear some plain truth as to the relative value and expense of subsidized liners as compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean lines and the financing of shipbuilding and iron-making plants are not calculated to win that measure of public enthusiasm which Senator Hanna predicts for a moribund project . Senator Hanna continues to renounce his Presidential ambitions in the positive manner of the small boy who protested : " Mother told me I must not take a second piece of cake unless you urged me very hard . " To an enthusiastic admirer in Fort Scott , Kan. , Mr. Hanna writes that the result of the Ohio election is gratifying as a " personal vindication , " but really it does not " justify the claims of my friends with reference to the suggestions of my nomination for the Presidency . " He must therefore ask his friends not to place him in an " embarrassing position . " The failure of these friends to consider his tender sensibilities is one of the marvels or recent politics Only a fortnight or so ago , dispatches from Birmingham announced that quantities of Hanna boom " literature " were being received and distributed by the Lily White Republicans . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at work . We shudder to think of Mr Hanna 's wrath should a large number of Southern delegates come to the convention ready to do or die for him . He would be absolutely at the mercy of these devoted followers unless he could peisuade President Roosevelt to toss them a few offices in order to still their clamor . Painful as such a step might he , Mr. Hanna has , we trust , the courage to face the emergency . In the meantime he might learn by heart the words which another man uttered when he was talked of for the Presidency . Gen. Sherman used no soft phrases about " embarrassment , " but said flatly that he would not take the nomination if it were offered , and would not serve if he were elected . The decline of 3,500,000 tons this year in the shipments of iron ore from the Lake Superior region will not create surprise . History has been made very fast in the iron and steel ' industry in the last month or two , and what was considered for practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , a desirable state of affairs , has suddenly taken on an-opposite appearance . Down to a comparatively recent date the iron and steel brokers , and others to whom the public looks for authoritative views regarding the industry , represented conditions as in every way healthy But when the Steel Trust dividend was cut early , sm October , and it was stated that the concern 's orders were some 22 per cent . below those of a year previous , the fact could no longer be concealed that something more than a " moderate reaction " was in process The real trend was known , of course , months before the public was let into the secret . Such facts as the great building strikes and the increasing difficulty of placing railroad loans were not lost on the iron and steel manufacturers The fact that their deliveries on old contracts continued heavy , blinded the public pretty effectually , but not the trade . The point was not reached . until recently , when the . mills had so far caught up on their orders that , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down part of their plants . That is probably why even a larger decrease than 3,500,000 tons of ore has not been witnessed this year . No very tangible results are likely to follow the exchange of cordialities between the Italian and the English Kings , but the bond between Italy and England is so real that it needs no expression in formal treaties Italy is the only country in Europe where the English are not only tolerated , but liked Their habit of villa residence has resulted in many friendships and intermarriages between the aristocracy of the two nations Finally , England offered asylum to the refugees of the war of liberation , and gave counsel , encouragement , and the songs of her poets to that great uprising . An international understanding rarely has so solid a basis . Very naturally , then , the ceremonies and speeches , being matters of course , lack some of the enthusiasm and rhetoric that have characterized more flimsy demonstrations of international friendship . Looking to the future , the activity of King Victor Emmanuel in cultivating relations with France and England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that Italy is gradually depending less on the Triple Alliance . So much may be gathered from an interview with the new Foreign Secretary . Commending , as in duty bound , the old alliance , he said that on the Balkan question Italy and England were in perfect accord . That means that Italy looks askance at the preponderancy of Russia and Austria in the Levant . But more important than such immediate possibilities is the public assertion of common interest between the two kingdoms . On occasion this sentiment could lie converted into a treaty for joint action in the Mediterranean .
