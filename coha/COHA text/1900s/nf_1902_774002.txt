txt // power , and the tide of battle rolled backwards and forwards over the low meadows outside the royal burgh , victory inclining now to one side , now to the other . In the end , after great slaughter on both sides , the Saxons gave way , and the young king and his brother fell back from Reading , leaving the body of the brave and faithful Ethelwulf among the dead . It is said that the Pagans dragged it to Derby . What matter ! The strong soul had done its work , and gone to its reward . Small need of tomb for the bodies of the bravo and faithful ? of such men the whole land and the hearts of its people is the tomb . A few lines in a later chronicler have here deceived even so acute and accurate a writer as Dr. Pauli , who says that Ethelred and Alfred were pursued from Reading field as far as Twyford , and crossed the Thames at a ford near Windsor , which was unknown to the Danes . Had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , away from all their resources , and , the battle having been fought on the south bank of the Thames , must have crossed into Mercia , leaving the whole of Wessex open to the pagan host . Dr. Pauli , and the authorities he has followed , going on this hypothesis , are at a loss as to the scene of the next great battle , that of Ascesdune , not knowing apparently that there is a district of that name in Berkshire , at the western end of the country , on the summit of the chalk hills which run through the country as a backbone from Goring to Swindon . Tradition agrees with the description of the field in the oldest chroniclers in marking this Ashdown as the // spot where the great fight was fought . Ethelred and Alfred then fell back with their broken bands along the south bank of the Thames westward , until they struck the hills , and then still back along the ancient track known as the Ridgeway , past Ilsley and past the royal burgh of Wantage , Alfred 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justified them in turning to bay on the fourth day after the disaster at Reading . The Pagans were on their track with their whole host ( except King Guthrum and his men ) , in two divisions ; one com manded by the two kings Bagsac and Halfdene , the other by the j arls . Ethelred , on perceiving this dis position of the enemy , divided his forces , taking com mand himself of the division which was to act against the kings , and giving the other to Alfred . Each side threwup hasty earthworks , the remains of which may be seen to this day on at least three spots of the downs , the highest point of which is White Horse Hill ; and all of which , according to old maps , are included in the district known as Ashdown . That highest point had been seized by the Pagans , and here the opposing hosts rested by their watch-fires through the cold March night . We may fancy from the one camp the song of Regner Lodbrog beguiling the night watches : ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the conflict of arms . Man should meet man and never give ground . In this hath ever stood the nobleness of the warrior . He who aspires to the love of his mistress should be dauntless in the clash of arms . " In the other camp we know that 6 // by one fire lay a youth , who carried in his bosom the Psalms of David written out in a fair hand , which he was wont to read in all intervals of rest . Here too is a son of Odin of the pure royal lineage , who will come to the clash of arms on the morrow in the strength of " the Lord of Hosts , who teacheth his hands to war and his fingers to fight . " At early dawn the hosts are on foot . Let Alfred 's old friend tell the tale in his own words : ? " Alfred , we have been told by some who were there and would not lie , marched up promptly with his men to give battle . But King Ethelred stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , and sent word that he would not leave it till the priest had done , or abandon God 's help for that of man . And he did so too , which afterwards availed him much , as we shall declare more fully . Now the Christians had determined that King Ethelred with his men should fight the two pagan kings , and that Alfred his brother with his men should take the chance of war against the earls . Things being so arranged , the King remained long time in prayer , while the Pagans pressed on swiftly to the fight . Then Alfred , though holding the lower command , could no longer support the onslaught of the enemy without retreating , or charging upon them without waiting for his brother . " A moment of fearful anxiety this , we may note , for the young prince . But he has a strong heart for such a crisis ; and , dreading the effect on his men of one step backwards , puts himself at their head and leads them up the slope against the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boar " ( aprino more ) . " For he too relied on the help of God , " Asser goes on , and also we see had already learnt something from the Reading disaster , for " he formed his men in a dense phalanx to meet the foe , " which was never broken in that long fight . Mass being over , Ethelred comes up to the help of his brother , and the battle raged along the whole hill-side . " But here I must inform those who are ignorant of the fact , that the field of battle was not equal for both sides . The Pagans occupied the higher ground , and the Christians came up from below . There was also in that place a single stunted thorn tree , which we have seen with our own eyes . Round this tree the opposing hosts came together with loud shouts from all sides , the one party to pursue their wicked course , the other to fight for their lives , their wives and children , and their country . And , when both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pagans by God 's judgment gave way , being no longer able to abide the Christian onslaught , and after losing great part of their army broke in shameful flight . One of their two kings and five jarls were there slain , together with many thousand Pagans , who covered with their bodies the whole plain of Ashdown . There fell in that fight King Bagsac ( by the hand , as some say , of Ethelred ) ; Earl Sidroc the elder and Earl Sidroc the younger , Earl Osbern , Earl Frene , and Earl Ilarald . And all the pagan host pursued its flight , not only until night , but through the next day , even until they reached the stronghold from which they had come forth . The // Christians followed , slaying all they could reach until dark . " Ethelward the chronicler , the greatgrandson of Ethelred , adds , " Neither before or since was ever such slaughter known since the Saxons first gained England by their arms . " The whole story does not take more than ten lines in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty minutes at most , must have been in the life of Alfred . A youth for the first time in independent command , with the memory of the mishap four days back at Reading as his only experience in war , opposed to two hostile armies each as numerous as his own , flushed with their late victory , and led by the most terrible warriors of the time ? he has to decide there , peremptorily , the fate of England hanging on his judgment , whether he will give ground and wait for his brother , or himself attack . Stand still he can not , as the enemy swarm on the slopes above , and partially covered by the formation of the ground , already ply his men with missiles to which they can make no useful reply . After that Ashdown dawn every future supreme moment and crisis of his eventful life must have come on him as child's-play . " Bad sac and the two Sidrocs , at the top of the down , with double my numbers , already overlapping my flanks ? Ethelred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the name of God and St. Cuthbert , yes . " IIe who could so answer , and thereupon himself lead up the hill in wild-boar fashion ( aprino more ) , has hereafter no question he need fear in the domain of war . That moment has hardened his nerve to flint , and his // judgment amid the clash of arms , to steel . Through all those weary years of battle and misfortune that follow , there is in Alfred no sign of indecision or faint-heartedness . Against any enemy but the Danes , such a victory as that of Ashdown would have been decisive for a generation , but the hopeless nature of the war which the West Saxons had now to maintain can not be better illustrated than by the events which immediately follow . The scattered remains of the pagan army came back into the Reading entrenchments in the next fewjdays , and there seem to have found Guthrum and his troops , with newreinforcements of plunderers from East Anglia and over the sea , upon whom they rallied at once . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , avoiding the chalk hills , the scene of their late defeat , a large band of them strike across the Kennet , and so away south-west , through new country into Hampshire . Ethelred and Alfred hastening down after them , catch them at Basing in a strong position , before which the Saxons are worsted , but , as is significantly added , the Pagans get no spoil in the expedition . One more battle the brave Ethelred was destined , about two months later , to fight for his people . It is said to have happened at a place called Merton , but could scarely have been at the village in Surrey of that name , as is usually supposed . Guthrum would never have struck back through a eolmtry already pillaged , nor , had he done so , were Ethelred and Alfred likely to have followed , leaving the entrenched camp at Reading in their rear , and // their own homes open to the garrison . However , at the place called Merton by the chroniclers , wherever it may be , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwearied foes . Large reinforcements , " an innumerable summer army , " as Ethelward calls them , had come to the Danish headquarters at Reading in the last few weeps . They had now regained their old superiority in numbers , and fought again in two divisions . Through the greater part of the day the Saxons had the better , but towards evening fortune changed , and at last , after great loss on both sides , the Pagan " had possession of the place of death . " Edmund , the new bishop of Sherborne , successor to the . gallant Ealstan , was here slain , and AEthelred himself is said to have been mortall , y wounded . At any rate he died almost immediately after the battle , and was buried by Alfred , with kingly honours , in Wimbourne Minster . Sherborne , the burial-place of the family of Cerdic , had for the moment no bishop , was closed perhaps , may even have been in pagan hands . And thus , at the age of twenty-three , Alfred ascended the throne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its f all . // CHAPTER VII . ALFRED ON THE THRONE . " O Lord my God , Thou hast made Thy servant king ; and I am but a little child : I know not how to go out or to come in . " THE throne of the West Saxons was not an inheritance to be desired in the year 871 , when Alfred succeeded his gallant brother . It descended on him without comment or ceremony , as a matter of course . There was not even an assembly of the witan to declare the succession , as in ordinary times . With Guthrum. and Ilinguar in their entrenched camp at the confluence of the Thames and Bennet , and fresh bands of marauders sailing up the former river , and constantly swelling the ranks of the pagan army during these summer months , there was neither time nor heart amongst the wise men of the West Saxons for strict adherence to the letter of the constitution , however venerable . We have seen , too , that the succession had already been settled by the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's will , that his three sons should succeed to the exclusion of the children of any one of them . // The idea of strict hereditary succession has taken so strong a hold of us English in later times , that it is necessary constantly to insist that our old English kingship was elective . Alfred 's title was based on election ; and so little was the idea of usurpation , or of any wrong done to the two infant sons of Ethelred , connected with his accession , that even the lineal descendant of one of those sons , in his chronicle of that eventful year , does not pause to notice the fact that Ethelred left children . Ile is writing to his " beloved cousin Matilda , " to instruct her in the things which he had received from ancient traditions , " of the history of our race down to these two kings from whom we have our origin . " " The fourth son of Ethelwulf , " lie writes , " was Ethelred , who , after the death of Ethelbert , succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather . The fifth was Alfred , who succeeded after all the others to the whole sovereignty , and was your grandfather 's grandfather . " And so passes on to the neat facts , without a word as to the claims of his own lineal ancestor , though he had paused in his narrative at this point for the special purpose of introducing a little family episode . This Icing has indeed been anointed by the Pope , named by his royal father and brother , and elected by his people ; may not we add , taking Mr. Carlyle 's test , that lie had been also elected for them in heaven ? If it will not hold in his case , we must indeed throw up this idea of election altogether , and allow that Heaven has nothing to say to the business . But we who value our England as we have it will not just // now dispute about where or how Alfred got elected , or from whence the right came to him to stand forth in this dark hour , a shepherd who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to tread the winepress alone . Enough for us that he , and no other , was found there ; and so , that we have our own country , and not another kind of country altogether in which to live . When Alfred had buried his brother in the cloisters of Wimborne Minster , and had time to look out from his Dorsetshire resting-place , and take stock of the immediate prospects and work which lay before him , we can well believe that those historians are right who have told us that for the moment he lost heart and hope , and suffered himself to doubt whether God would by his hand deliver the afflicted nation from its terrible straits . In the eight pitched battles which we find by the Saxon Chronicle ( Asser giving seven only ) had already been fought with the pagan army , the flower of the youth of these parts of the West Salon kingdom must have fallen . The other Teutonic kingdoms of the island , of which he was overlord , and so bound to defend , bad ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Mercia , awaiting their doom . Dent , Sussex , and Surrey , which were now an integral part of the royal inheritance of his own family , were at the mercy of his enemies , and he without a hope of striking a blow for them . London had been pillaged , and was in ruins . Even in Wessex proper , Berkshire and Hampshire , with parts of Wilts and Dorset , had been crossed and // recrossed by marauding bands , in whose track only smoking ruins and dead bodies were found . " The . and was as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them a desolate wilderness . " These bands were at this very moment on foot , striking into new districts further to the south-west , than they had yet reached . If the rich lands of Somersetshire and Devonshire , and the yet unplundered parts of Wilts and Dorset , are to be saved , it must be by prompt and decisive fighting , and it is time for a king to be in the field . Rnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred can gather men enough round his standard to take the field openly . Even then , when he fights , it is " almost against his will , " for his ranks are sadly thin , and the whole pagan army are before him , at Wilton near Salisbury . Tlie action would seem to have been brought on by the impetuosity of Alfred 's own men , whose spirit was still unbroken , and their confidence in their young king enthuiastic . There was a long and fierce fight as usual , during the earlier part of which the Saxons had the advantage , though greatly outnumbered . But again we get glimpses of the old trap of a feigned flight and ambuscade , into which they fell , and so again lose " possession of the place of death , " the ultimate test of victory . " ' Phis year , " says the Saxon Chronicle , " nine general battles were fought against the army in the kingdom south of the Thames ; besides which , Alfred the king 's brother , and single aldermen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were not counted ; and within the year one king and // nine jarls were slain . " Wilton was the last of these general actions , and not long afterwards , probably in the auturnn , Alfred inade peace with the Pagans , on condition that they should quit Wessex at once , They were probably allowed to carry off whatever spoils they may have been able to accumulate in their Reading camp , but I can find no authority for believing that Alfred fell into the fatal and humiliating mistake of either paying ; them anything , or giving hostages , or promising tribute . There are constant notices of such payments in the chroniclers when arty such were actually made , as , for instance , in the case of Mercia in the following year ; so , in the absence of positive affirmative evidence , I am not prepared to believe that Guthrum and his swarm of pirates were bought out of Wessex by Alfred in the first year of his reign . It seems far more likely that they had had more desperate fighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nine months since they broke up their winter quarters at Tbetford , and were glad of peace for the present . This young king , who , as crown prince , led the West Saxons up the slopes at Ashdown , when Bagsae , the two Sidroes , and the rest were killed , and who bas very much their own way of fighting ? going into the clash of arms , " when the bard steel rings upon the high helmets , " and " the beasts of prey have ample spoil , " like a veritable child of Odin ? is clearly one whom it is best to let alone , at any rate so long ; as easy plunder and rich lands are to be found elsewhere , without such poison-mad fighting for every herd of cattle , and rood of ground . In92 ALFRED THE GREAT . deed I think the careful reader may trace from the date of Ashdown a decided unwillingness on the part of the Danes to meet Alfred , except when they could catch him at disastrous odds . They succeeded indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom , in driving him an exile for a few wretched weeks to the shelter of his own forests ; but whenever he was once fairly in the field , they preferred taking refuge in strong places , and offering treaties and hostages , to the actual arbitrament of battle . So the pawn army quitted reading , and wintered in 372 in the neighborhood of London , at which place they receive proposals from Buhred , king of the Mercians , Alfred 's brother-in-law , and for a money payment pass hint and his people contemptuously by for the time , malting some kind of treaty of peace with them , and go northward into what has now become their own country . They winter in Lincolnshire , gathering fresh strength during 873 from the never-failing sources of supply across the narrow seas . Again , however , in this year of ominous rest they renew their sham peace with poor Buhred and his Mercians , who thus manage to tide it over another winter . In 874 , however , their time has come . In the spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oskytal , and Amund , burst into Mercia . In this one only of the English Teutonic kingdoms they find neither fighting nor suffering hero to cross their way , and leave behind for a thousand years the memory of a noble end , cut out there in some half-dozen lines of // an old chronicler , but full of life and inspiration to this day for all Englishmen . Here we have neither a pious Algar , or lay brother Toly , calmly taking their last sacrament at sunbreak , within hearing of the pagan rites over their fallen king ; nor Alderman Ethehvulf with his faith in the captaincy of Christ ; nor Bing Edmund , " gentle landlord , " and slow in battle , but with the constancy that can brave all torture , if the will of God be so ; still less a king who carries the Psalms of David in his bosom under his armour , and will fight nine pitched battles in a year , whose presence lifts the hearts of men , and nerves their arms till they cease to reckon odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these poor Mercians do ? The whole country is overrun , and reduced under pagan rule without a blow struck , so far as we know , and within the year . This poor Buhred , titular king of the Mercians , who has made belief to rule this English kingdom these twenty-two years ? who in his time has marched with his father-in-law Ethelwulf across North Wales ? has beleaguered Nottingham with his brothers-in-law , Ethelred and Alfred , six years back , not without show of manhood ? sees for his part nothing for it under such circumstances but to get away as swiftly as possible , as many so-called kings have done before him and since . The West Saxon court is no place for him , quite other views of kingship prevailing in those parts . So the poor Bullred breaks away from his anchors , leaving his wife Ethelswitha even , in his baste , to take refuge with her brother ; or is it that the heart of the daughter of // the race of Cerdic swells against leaving the land which her sires had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of sorest need ? In any case Buhred drifts away alone across into France , and so towards the winter to Rome . ' there he dies at once , about Christmas time 574 , of shame and sorrow probably , or of a broken heart as we say ; at any rate having this kingly gift left in him , that he can not live and look on the ruin of his people , as St. Edmund 's brother Edwold is doing in these same years , " near a clear well at Carnelia , in Dorsetshire , " doing the hermit business there . on bread and water . The English in Lorne bury away poor Buhred , with all the honours , in the church of St. Mary 's , to which the English schools rebuilt by his father-inlaw Ethelwulf were attached . Ethelswitha visited , or started to visit , the tomb years later , we are told , in 855 , when Afercia had risen to new life under her great brother 's rule . Through these same months Guthrum , Oskytal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the cloister where the kingly line of Mercia lie ; disturbing perhaps the bones of the great Offa , whom Charlemagne had to treat as an equal . Neither of the pagan kings are inclined at this time to settle in Mercia ; so , casting about what to do with it , they light on " a certain foolish man , " a king 's thane , one Ceolwulf , and set him up as a sort of King Popinjay . From this Ceolwulf they take hostages for the payment of yearly tribute ( to be wrung out of these poor Mercians on pain of dethroneALFRED // ment ) , and for the surrender of the kingdom to them on whatever day they would have it back again . Foolish king 's thanes , turned into King Popinjays by Pagans , and left to play at government on such terms , are not pleasant or profitable objects in such times as these of 1,000 years since ? or indeed in any times for the matter of that . So let its finish with Ceoltivulf , just noting that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found much of the spoil of monasteries , and the pickings of earl and churl , of folkland and bookland , sticking to his fingers , instead of finding its way to their coffers . This was far from their meaning in setting him up in the high places of Mercia . So they just strip him , and thrust him out , and he dies in beggary . This then is the winter 's work of the great pagan army at Lepton , Alfred watching them and their work doubtless with keen eye ? not without misgivings too at their numbers , swollen again to terrible proportions since they sailed away down Thames after Wilton fight . It will take years yet before the gaps in the fighting strength of Wessex , left by those nine pitched battles , and other smaller fights , will be filled by the crop of youths passing from childhood to manhood . An anxious thought that for a young king . The Pagans , however , are not yet ready for another throw for Wessex ; and so when Mercia is sucked dry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great a host , they again sever . Halfdene , who would seem to have joined them recently , takes a large part of the army away from him northwards . // Settling his headquarters by the river Tyne , he subdues all the land , and " ofttimes spoils the Picts and the Strathclyde Britons . " Amongst other holy places in those parts , Halfdene visits the Isle of Lindisfarne , hoping perhaps in his pagan soul not only to commit ordinary sacrilege in the holy places there , which is every-clay work for the like of him , but even to lay impious hands on , and to treat with indignity , the remains of that holy man , St. Cuthbert , of whom we have already heard , and who has become in due course patron and guardian saint of hunters , and of that scourge of Pagans , Alfred the West Saxon . If such were his thought , he is disappointed of his sacrilege ; for Bishop Eardulf and Abbot Eadred ? devout and strennous persons ? having timely warning of his approach , carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years hide with it up and down the distracted northern countries , now here , now there , moving that sacred treasure from place to place until this bitterness is overpast , and holy persons and things , dead or living , are no longer in clanger , and the bodies of saints may rest safely in fixed shrines ; the pawn armies and disorderly persons of all kinds having been converted , or suppressed , in the meantime . For - which good deed , the royal Alfred ( in whose calendar St. Cuthbert , patron of huntsmen , stands very high ) will surely warmly befriend them hereafter , when he has settled his accounts with many persons and things . From the time of this incursion of Halfdene , Northumbria may be considered once more a settled state ; but a Danish , not a Saxon one . ALFRED ON THE THRONE . 97 The rest and greater part of the army , under Guthrmn , Oskytal , and Amund , on leaving Repton , strike south-east , through what was Landlord Edmund 's country , to Cambridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter of 875. // CHAPTER VIII . THE SECOND WAVE . TziE downfall , exile , and death of his brother-inlaw in 874 must have warned Alfred , if he had any need of warning , that no treaty could bind these foemen , and that he had nothing to look for but the same measure as soon as the pagan leaders felt themselves strong enough to mete it out to him and Wessex . In the following year we accordingly find him on the alert , and taking action in a new direction . These heathen pirates , he sees , fight his people at terrible advantage by reason of their command of the sea . This enables them to choose their own point of attack , not only along the sea-coast , but up every river as far as their light galleys can swim ; to retreat unmolested , at their own time , whenever the fortune of war turns against them ; to bring reinforcements of men and supplies to the scene of action without fear of hindrance . His Saxons have long since given up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural people , drawing almost everything they need from their own soil . The few foreign tastes they have are supplied by foreign traders . // However , if Wessex is to be made safe , the sea-kings must be met on their own element ; and so , with what expenditure of patience and nibney , and encouraging words and example we may easily conjecture , the young king gets together a small fleet , and himself takes command of it . We have no clue to the point on the south coast where the admiral of twenty-five fights his first naval action , but know only that in the summer of 875 he is cruising with his fleet , and meets seven tall ships of the enemy . One of these he captures , and the rest make off after a hard fight ? no small encouragement to the sailor king , who has thus for another year saved Saxon homesteads from devastation by fire and sword . The second wave of invasion had now at last gathered weight and volume enough , and broke on the king and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still young when the whole pagan army , which had wintered at and about Cambridge , marched to their ships , and put to sea . Guthrinn was in command , with the other two kings , Anketel and Amund , as his lieutenants , under whom was a host as formidable as that which had marched across Mercia through forest and waste , and sailed up the Thames five years before , to the assault of Reading . There must have been some few days of harassing suspense , for we can not suppose that Alfred was not aware of the movements of his terrible foes . Probably his new fleet cruised off the south coast on the watch for them , and all up the Thames there were gloomy watchings , and forebodings of a repetition of the evil // days of S71 . But the suspense was soon over . Passing by the Thames ' mouth , and through Dover Straits , the pagan fleet sailed , and westward still past many tempting harbours and rivers ' mouths , until they came off the coast of Dorsetshire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck of land between the rivers Frome and Piddle , on which stood , when they landed , a fortress of the West Saxons and a monastery of holy virgins . Fortress and monastery fell into the hands of the Danes , who set to work at once to throw up earthworks and otherwise fortify a space large enough to contain their army , and all spoil brought in by marauding bands from this hitherto unpluudered country . This fortified camp was soon very strong , except on the western side , upon which Alfred shortly appeared with a body of horsemen , and such other troops as could be gathered hastily together . The detachments of the Pagans , who were already out pillaging the whole neighbourhood , fell back apparently before him , concentrating on the Wareham camp . Before its outworks Alfred paused . He is too experienced a soldier now to risk at the outset of a campaign such a disaster as that which he and Ethelred had sustained in their attempt to assault the camp at Reading in 871 . IIe is just strong enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin to spare . So he sits down before the camp , but no battle is fought , neither he nor Guthrum caring to bring matters to that issue . Soon negotiations are commenced , and again a treaty is made . // On this occasion Alfred would seem to have taken special pains to bind his faithless foe . All the holy relics which could be procured from holy places in the neighbourhood were brought together , that he himself and his people might set the example of pledging themselves in the most solemn manner known to Christian men . Then a holy ring or bracelet , smeared with the blood of beasts sacrificed to Woden , was placed on a heathen altar . Upon this Guthrum and his fellow kings and earls swore on behalf of the army that they would quit the King 's country and give hostages . Such an oath had never been sworn by Danish leader on English soil before . It was the most solemn known to them . They would seem also to have sworn on Alfred 's relics , as an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostages " from amongst the most renowned men in the army " were duly handed over . Alfred now relaxed his watch , even if he did not withdraw with the main body of his army , leaving his horse to see that the terms of the treaty were performed , and to watch the Wareham camp until the departure of the pagan host . But neither oath on sacred ring , nor the risk of their hostages , weighed with Guthrum and his followers when any advantage was to be gained by treachery . They steal out of the camp by night , surprise and murder the Saxon horsemen , seize the horses , and strike across the country , the mounted men leading , to Exeter , but leaving a sufficient garrison to hold Wareham for the present . They surprise and get possession of the western capital , and there settle down to // pass the winter . Rollo , fiercest of the vikings , is said by Asser to have passed the winter with them in their Exeter quarters on his way to Normandy ; but whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certain that the channel swarmed with pirate fleets , who could put in to Wareham or Exeter at their discretion , and find a safe stronghold in either place from which to carry fire and sword through the unhappy country . Alfred had vainly endeavoured to overtake the march to Exeter in the autumn of 876 , and failing in the pursuit , had disbanded his own troops as usual , allowing then to go to their homes until the spring . Before he could be afoot again in the spring of 877 the main body of the Pagans at Exeter had made that city too strong for any attempt at assault , so the King and his troops could do no more than beleaguer it on the land side , as he had done at Wareham . But Guthrum could laugh at all efforts of his great antagonist , and wait in confidence the sure disbanding of the Saxon troops at harvest-time , so long as his ships held the sea . Supplies were soon running short in Exeter , but the Exe was open , and communications going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there shall be broken up , and the whole garrison with their spoil shall join head-quarters . 120 Danish war-galleys are freighted , and beat down channel , but are baffled by adverse winds for nearly a month . They and all their supplies may be looked for any day in the Exe when the wind changes . Alfred , from his camp before ExTHE // eter , sends to his little fleet to put to sea . He can not himself be with them as in their first action , for he - knows well that Guthrum will seize the first moment of his absence to sally from Exeter , break the Saxon lines , and scatter his army in roving bands over Devonshire , on their way back to the eastern kingdom . The Saxon fleet puts out , manned itself as some say , partly with sea-robbers , hired to fight their own people . However manned , it attacks bravely a portion of the pirates . But a mightier power than the fleet fought for Alfred at this crisis . First a dense fog , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast with such fury that the Pagans lost no less than 100 of their chief ships off Swanage ; as mighty a deliverance perhaps for England ? though the memory of it is nearly forgotten ? as that which began in the same seas 700 years later , when Drake and the sea-kings of the 16th century were hanging on the rear of the Spanish Armada along the Devon and Dorest coasts , while the beacons blazed up all over England , and the whole nation flew to arms . The destruction of the fleet decided the fate of the siege of Exeter . Once more negotiations are opened by the Pagans ; once more Alfred , fearful of driving them to extremities , listens , treats , and finally accepts oaths and more hostages , acknowledging probably in sorrow to himself that he can for the moment do no better . And on this occasion Guthrum , being caught far from home , and without supplies or ships , " keeps the peace well , " moving as we conjecture , watched jealously by Alfred , on the shortest line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avon , and so across into Mercia , where he arrives during harvest , and billets his army on Ceolwulf , camping them for the winter about the city of Gloster . There they run up huts for themselves , and make some pretence of permanent settlement on the Severn , dividing large tracts of land amongst those who cared to take them . The campaigns of 876 ? 7 are generally looked upon as disastrous ones for the Saxon arms , but this view is certainly not supported by the chroniclers . It is true that both at Wareham and Exeter the Pagans broke new ground , and secured their positions , from which no doubt they did sore damage in the neighbouring districts ; but we can trace in these years none of the old ostentatious daring , and thirst for battle with Alfred . Whenever lie appears the pirate bands draw back at once into their strongholds , and , exhausted as great part of Wessex must have been by the constant strain , the West Saxons show no signs yet of failing from their gallant king . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an army as fought at Ashdown , he can still , without much delay , bring to his side a sufficient force to hem the Pagans in and keep them behind their ramparts . But the nature of the service was telling sadly on the resources of the kingdom south of the Thames . To the Saxons there came no new levies , while from the north and east of England , as well as from over the sea , Guthrurn was ever drawing to his standard wandering bands of sturdy Northmen . The most important of these reinforcements came to him from an // unexpected quarter this autumn . We have not heard for some years of IIubba , the brother of Hinguai , the younger of the two vikings who planned and led the first great invasion in 868 . Perhaps he may have resented the arrival of Guthrum and other kings in the following years , to whom he had to give place . Whatever may have been the cause , he seems to have gone off on his own account , carrying with him the famous raven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other coasts under its ominous shade . This " war-flag which they call raven " was a sacred object to the Northmen . When Hinguar and Hubba had heard of the death of their father , Regner Lodbrog , and had resolved to . avenge him , while they were calling together their followers , their three sisters in one day wove for them this war-flag , in the midst of which was portrayed the figure of a raven . Whenever the flag went before them into battle , if they were to win the day the sacred raven would rouse itself and stretch its wings , but if defeat awaited them the flag would hang round its staff , and the bird remain motionless . This wonder had been proved in many a fight , so the wild Pagans who fought under the standard of Regner 's children believed . It was a power in itself , and Hubba and a strong fleet were with it . They had appeared in the Bristol Channel in this autumn of 877 , and had ruthlessly slaughtered and spoiled the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the country is wild mountain for the most part , and the people very poor , they will remain no longer than they can help . Already a large // part of the army about Gloster are getting restless . The story of their march from Devonshire , through rich districts of Wessex yet unplundered , goes round amongst the new-corners . Guthrum has no power , probably no will , to keep then to their oaths . In the early winter a joint attack is planned by him and Ilubba on the West Saxon territory . By Christmas they are strong enough to take the field , and so in mid-winter , shortly after Twelfth-night , the camp at Gloster breaks up , and the army " stole away to Chippenham , " recrossing the Avon once more into Wessex , under Guthrum . The fleet , after a short delay , cross to the Devonshire coast , under Hubba , in thirty war-ships . And now at last the courage of the West Saxons gives way . The surprise is complete . Wiltshire is at the mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chippenham , as head-quarters , overrun the whole district , drive many of the inhabitants " beyond the sea for want of the necessaries of life , " and reduce to subjection all those that remain . Alfred is at his post , but for the moment can make no head against them . Ilis own strong heart and trust in God are left him , and with them and a scanty band of followers he disappears into the forest of Selwood , which then stretched away from the confines of Wiltshire for thirty miles to the west . East Somerset , now one of the fairest and richest of English counties , was then for the most part thick wood and tangled swamp , but miserable as the lodging is it is welcome for the time to the King . In the first months of 87S , Selwood Forest holds in its recesses the hope of England . // CHAPTER IX . ATHELNEY . " Behold a King shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in judgment . And a man shall be as an hiding-place from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land . " AT first sight it seems hard to account for the sudden and complete collapse of the West Saxon power in January 878 . In the campaign of the last year Alfred had been successful on the whole , both by sea and land . He had cleared the soil of Wessex from the enemy , and had reduced the pagan leaders to sue humbly for terms , and to give whatever hostages he demanded . Yet three months later the simple crossing of the Avon and taking of Chippenham is enough , if we can believe the chroniclers , to paralyse the whole kingdom , and to leave Alfred a fugitive , hiding in Seiwood Forest , with a mere handful of followers and his own family . But there is no doubt or discrepancy in the accounts . The Saxon Chronicle says , in its short clear style , that the army stole away to Chippenham during mid-winter , after . Twelfth-night , and sat down there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the sea , and of the rest the greater part they subdued and forced to obey them , except King Alfred ; and he with a small band with difficulty retreated to the woods and the fastnesses of the moors . " Asser and the rest merely expand this statement in one form or another , leaving the main facts ? the complete success of the blow , and the inability of Alfred at the moment to ward it off , or return it , or recover from it ? altogether unquestioned . Some writers have thought to account for it by transposing a passage from Brompton , narrating obscurely a battle at Chippenham , and another at a place called Abendune , in both of which Alfred is defeated . This occurs in Brompton in the year 871 , and , being clear ; y out of place there , has been seized on to help out the difficulty in the year 878 . But there does not appear to be the least ground for taking this liberty with Brompton 's text , nor even , if there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any fact which is not to be found in the Saxon Chronicle , or Asser . Nor indeed is there need of any such explanation when the facts come to be carefully examined . In the first place , this winter inroad on Chippenham was made at a time of year when even the vikings and their followers were usually at rest . Guthrum and his host fell upon the Wiltshire and Somersetshire men when they were quite unprepared , and before they had had time to hide away their wives and children or any provision of corn or // beasts . Then the country was already exhausted . The Pagans , it is true , had not yet visited this part of Wessex , but the drain of men must have been felt here , in the last eight years , as well as further east and south . We remark , too , that these West Saxons are the nearest neighbours of the Mercians , amongst whom a considerable body of the Danes had been now settled for some years . Paganism was rife again at Gloster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These pagan setters , though insolent and overbearing , still lived side by side with the Saxon inhabitants ; did not attempt to drive them out or exterminate them ; left them some portion of their worldly goods . On the other hand , what hope is there . in fighting against a foe who has nothing to lose but his life , whose numbers are inexhaustible . Might it not be better to make any terms with them , such , for instance , as our Mercian brethren have made ? This young king of ours can not protect us , has spent all his treasure in former wars , has little indeed left but his name . Who is Alfred ? and what is the race of Cerdic ? Know ye not that we are consumed ? Here , for the first time , in 878 , we find traces of this kind of demoralization and of disloyalty to their king and land on the part of a portion of his people ; and the strong and patient soul of Alfred must have been wrung by an anguish such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his hiding-place of this apostasy . Here then our great king touches the lowest point in his history . So far as outward cire im$teaicee go , humiliation can indeed hardly go // further than this . Are we to believe the story that he had earned and prepared that humiliation for himself in those first few years of his reign between the autumn of 872 , when the camp at Reading broke up , and the early spring of 876 , when the pagan fleet appeared off Wareham ? , The form in which this story comes clown to us is in itself suspicious . It rests mainly on the authority of the " Life of St. Neot , " a work of the next century , the author of which is not known ; but only thus winch about him , that he was a monk bent on exalting the character and history of his saint , without . much care at whose expense this was to be done . The passage in Asser , apparently confirming the staternenl , is regarded by all the best scholars as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Life of 5t . Neot , " so that it could not possibly be of the same date as the rest of Asser 's book , wbieh was written during the Ding 's lifetime . " The Almighty , " so the anonymous author writes , " not only granted to this king glorious victories over his enemies , but also allowed him to be harassed by them , and weighed down by misfortunes and by the low estate of his followers , to the end that lie might learn that there is one Lord of all things to whom every knee must bow , and in whose hand are the hearts of kings ; who puts down the mighty from their seat , and exalts them of low degree ; who suffer " Ilis servants , when they are at the height of good fortune , to be touched by the rod of adversity , that in their humility they may not despair of God 's mercy , and in their prosperity may not boast of their // honours , but may also know to whom they owe qll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brought on the Bing because in the beginning of his reign , when be was a youth and swayed by a youth 's impulses , he would not listen to the petitions which his subjects made to him for help in their necessities , or for relief from their oppressors , but used to drive them from him and pay no heed to their requests . This conduct gave much pain to the holy man St. Neot , who was his relation , and often foretold to him in the spirit of prophecy that he would suffer great adversity on this account . But Alfred neither attended to the proof of the man of God , nor listened to his soothsaying . Wherefore , seeing that a man 's sins must be punished , either in this world or the next , the true and righteous Judge willed that his son should not go unpunished in this world , to the end that Ile might spare him in the world to come . For this cause , therefore , Ning Alfred often fell into such great misery that sometimes none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become of him . " So writes the monkish historian , upon whose statement one remarks , that in the only place where it can be tested it is not accurate . The one occasion on which Alfred fell into such misery that his subjects did not know where he was , was in this January of 87 S. We know that for many years before his accession he was anxiously bent on acquiring knowledge , and in disciplining himself for his work in life , whatever it might be . Patience , humility , and utter for112 ALFRED THE GREAT . getfulness of self , the true royal qualities , shine out through every word and act of his life wherever we can get at them . Indeed , I think no one can be familiar with the authentic records of his words and works and believe that he could ever have alienated his people by arrogance , or impatience , or superciliousness . His would seem to be rather one of those rare natures which march through life without haste and without faltering ; bearing all things , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the evil which is going on all round him , and of which he is conscious in his own soul . IIe may indeed have alienated some nobles and official persons in his kingdom , by eurbing vigorously , and at once , the powers of the aldermen and reeves . Indeed , it is said , that in one of those years he hanged as many as forty-four reeves for unjust judgments , even for stretching the King 's prerogative against suitors . 1 o doubt , also , his demands on the people generally for military service , the building of ships , and restoring of fortified places , were burdensome , and may have caused some discontent . But there is no trustworthy evidence , that I have been able to find , of any disaffection , nor does it need the suggestion of any such cause to account for the events of the winter of 878 . So much then for the monkish tradition of Alfred 's arrogant youth and its results . It can not be passed over , but must be read by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it in minute detail . The King then disappears in January 878 from // the eyes of Saxon and Northmen , and we must follow him , by such light as tradition throws upon these months , into the thickets and marshes of Selwood . It is at this point , as is natural enough , that romance has been roost busy , and it has become impossible to disentangle the actual facts from monkish legend and Saxon ballad . In happier times Alfred was in the habit himself of talking over the events of his wandering life pleasantly with his courtiers , and there is no reason to doubt that the foundation of most of the stories still current rests on those conversations of the truth-loving King , noted down by Bishop Asser and others . The best known of these is , of course , the story of the cakes . In the depths of the Saxon forests there were always a few neat-herds and swine-berds , scattered up and down , living in rough huts enough , we may be sure , and occupied with the care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these in Selwood was a neat-herd of the King , a faithful man , to whom the secret of Alfred 's disguise was entrusted , and who kept it even from his wife . To this man 's but the King came one day alone , and , sitting himself down by the burning logs on the hearth , began mending his bow and arrows . The neat-herd 's wife had just finished her baking , and having other household matters to attend , confided her loaves to the King , a poor tired-looking body , who might be glad of the warmth , and could make himself useful by turning the batch , and so earn his share while she got on with other business . But Alfred worked S // away at his weapons , thinking of anything but the good housewife 's batch of loaves , which in due course tivere not only done , but rapidly burning to a cinder . At this moment the neat-herd 's wife comes back , and flying to the hearth to rescue the bread , cries out , " D'rat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them burning . I'ze warrant you ready enough to eat them when they 're done . " But besides the Ding 's faithful neat-herd , whose name is not preserved , there are other churls in the forest , who must be Alfred 's comrades just now if he will have any . And even here lie has an eye for a good man , and will lose no opportunity to help one to the best of his power . Such an one he finds in a certain swine-herd called I ) enewulf , whom lie gets to know , a thoughtful Saxon man , minding his charge there in the oak woods . The rougli churl , or thrall , we know not which , has great capacity , as Alfred soon finds out , and desire to learn . So the Ding goes to work upon Denewulf under the oak trees , when the swine will let him , and is well satisfied with the results of his teaching and the progress of his pupil , as will ' appear in the sequel . But in those miserable days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by for the Ding and his few companions , and for his wife and farm , y , who soon joined him in the forest , even if they were not with him from the first . The poor foresters can not maintain them , nor are this band of exiles the men to live on the poor . So Alfred and his comrades are soon out foraging on the borders of the // forest , and getting what subsistence they can from the Pagans , or from the Christians who had submitted to their yoke . So we may imagine them dragging on life till near Easter , when a gleam of good news comes up from the west , to gladden the hearts , and strengthen the arms , of these . poor men in the depths of Sel- , vood . Soon after Guthrum and the main body of the Pagans moved from Gloster , southwards , the Viking Hubba , as had been agreed , sailed with thirty ships of war from his winter quarters on the . South Welsh coast , and landed in Devon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disappearance of the Ding , was no doubt already known in the west ; and in the face of it Odda the alderman can not gather strength to ineet the Pagan in the open field . But he is a brave and true man , and will make no terms with the spoilers ; so , with other faithful thegns of Ding Alfred and their followers , he throws himself into a castle or fort called Cynwith , or Cynnit , there to abide whatever issue of this business God shell send them . IIubba , with the War-flag Raven , and a host laden with the spoil of rich Devon vales , appear in due course before the place . It is not strong naturally , and has only " walls in our own fashion , " meaning probably rough earthworks . But there are resolute men behind them , and on the whole IIubba declines the assault , and sits down before the place . There is no spring of water , he hears , within the Saxon lines , and they are otherwise wholly unprepared for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter , and the sword or slavery will be the , portion of Odda and the rest of Alfred 's men ; meantime there is spoil enough in the camp from Devonshire homesteads , which brave men can revel in round the war-flag Raven , while they watch the Saxon ramparts . Odda , however , has quite other views than death from thirst , or surrender . Befon , any stress comes , early one morning , he and hi : whole force sally out over their earthworks , and frown the first " cut down the pagans in great numbers : " 840 warriors ( some say 1,200 ) , with IIubba himself , are slain before Cynnit fort ; the rest , few in number , escape to their ships . The war-flag Raven is left in the hands of Odda and the men of Devon . This is the news which comes to Alfred , Ethelnoth the alderman of Somerset , Denewulf the swineherd , and the rest of the Selwood Forest group , some time before Easter . These men of Devonshire , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives against the pagan . No doubt up and down Wessex , thrashed and trodden out as the nation is by this time , there are other good men and true , who will neither cross the sea , or the Welsh marches , or make terms with the Pagan ; some sprinkling of men who will yet set life at stake , for faith in Christ and love of England . If these can only be rallied , who can say what may follow ? So , in the lengthening days of spring , council is held in Selwood , and there will have been Easter services in some chapel , or hermitage , in the forest , or , at any rate , in some quiet glade . The " day of days " will surely have had its voice // of hope for this poor remnant . Christ is risen and reigns ; and it is not in these heathen Danes , or in all the 1 orthmen who ever sailed across the sea , to put back His kingdom , or enslave those whom He has freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern boundary of the forest , on a rising ground ? hill it can scarcely be called ? surrounded by dangerous marshes formed by the little rivers Thone and Parret , fordable only in summer , and even then dangerous to all who have not the secret , a small fortified camp is thrown up under Alfred 's eye , by Ethelnoth and the Somersetshire men , where he can once again raise his standard . The spot has been chosen by the King with the utmost care , for it is his last throw . He names it the Etheling 's eig or island , " Athelney . " Probably his young son , the Etheling of England , is there amongst the first , with his mother and his grandmother Eadburgha , the widow of Ethelred Mucil , the venerable lady whom Asser saw in later years , and who has now no country but her daughter 's . There are , as has been reckoned , some two acres of hard ground on the island , and around vast brakes of alder-bush , full of deer and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication with him , and a small army grows together . They are soon strong enough to make forays into the open country , and in many skirmisbes they cut off parties of the Pagans , and supplies . " For , even when overthrown and cast down , " says Malmesbury , " Alfred had always to be fought // with ; so then , when one would esteem him altogether worn down and broken , like a snake slipping from the hand of him who would grasp it , he would suddenly flash out again from his hiding-places , rising up to smite his foes in the height of their insolent confidence , and never more hard to beat than after a flight . " But it was still a trying life at Athelney . Followers came in slowly , and provender and supplies-of all kinds are hard to wring from the Pagan , and harder still to take from Christian men . One day , while it was yet so cold that the water was still frozen , the Ding 's people lead gone out " to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sustained themselves withal . " No one was left in the royal but for the moment but himself , and his mother-in-law IEadburglha . Tlie Ding ( after his constant wont whensoever he had opportunity ) was reading from the Psalms of David , out of the Manual which he carried always in his bosom . At this moment a poor man appeared at the door and begged for a morsel of bread " for Christ His sake . " Whereupon the Ding , receiving the stranger as a brother , called to his mother-in-law to give him to eat . Eadburgha replied that there was but one loaf in their store , and a little wine in a pitcher , a provision wholly insufficient for his own family , and people . But the Bing bade her nevertheless to give the stranger part of the last loaf , which she accordingly did . But when he had been served the stranger was no more seen , and the loaf remained whole , and the // pitcher full to the brim . Alfred , meantime , . had turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamt that St. Cuthbert of Lindisfarne stood by him , and told him it was he who had been his guest , and that God had seen his afflictions and those of his people , which were now about to end , in token whereof his people would return that day from their expedition with a great take of fish . The King awaking , and being much impressed with his dream , called to his mother-in-law and recounted it to her , who thereupon assured him that she too had been overcome with sleep , and had had the same dream . And while they yet talked together on what had happened so strangely to them , their servants came in , bringing fish enough , as it seemed to them , to have fed an army . The monkish legend goes on to tell that on the next morning the King crossed to the mainland in a boat , and wound his horn thrice , which drew to him before noon 500 men . What we may think of tho story and the dream , as Sir John pclman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " seeing that whether we deem it natural or supernatural , " the one as well as the other serves at God 's appointment , by raising or dejecting of the mind with hopes or fears , to lead man to the resolution of those things whereof He has before ordained the event . " Alfred , we may be sure , was ready to accept and be thankful for any help , let it come from whence it might , and soon after Easter it was becoming clear that the time is at hand for more than skirmishing // expeditions . Through all the neighbouring counties word is spreading that their hero king is alive , and on foot again , and that there will be another chance for brave men ere long of meeting once more these scourges of the land , under his leading . A popular legend is found in the later chroniclers which relates that at this crisis of his fortunes , Alfred , not daring to rely on any evidence but that of his own senses as to the numbers , disposition , and discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minstrel , and with one attendant visited the camp of Guthrum . Here he stayed , " showing tricks and making sport , " until he had penetrated to the King 's tents , and learned all that he wished to know . After satisfying himself as to the chances of a sudden attack he returns to Athelncy , and the time having come for a great effort , if his people will but make it , sends round messengers to the aldermen and king 's thegns of neighbouring shires , giving them a tryst for the seventh week after Easter the second week in May . // CHAPTER X. ETHANDUNE . " Unto whom Fudas answered , It is no hard matter for many to be shut up in the hands of a few : and with the God of heaven it is all one to deliver with a great multitude or a small company . " For the victory of battle standeth not in the multitude of an host , but strength cometh from heaven . " They come against us in much pride and iniquity , to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil us . " But we fight for our lives and our laws . " ON or about the 12th of May , 878 , King Alfred left his island in the great wood , and his wife and children and such household gods as he had gathered round him there , and came publicly forth amongst his people once more , riding to Egbert 's Stone ( probably Brixton ) , on the east of Selwood , a distance of 26 miles . Here met him the men of the neighbouring shires ? Odda , no doubt , with his men of Devonshire , full of courage and hope after their recent triumph ; the men of Somersetshire , under their brave and faithful Alderman Ethelnoth ; and the men of Wilts and Hants , such of them at least as had not fled the country or made submission to the // enemy . " And when they saw their king alive after such great tribulation , they received him , as he merited , with joy and . acclamation . " The gathering had been so carefully planned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence with him at Athelney , that the Saxon host was organized , and ready for immediate action , on the very day of muster . Whether Alfred had been his own spy we can not tell , but it is plain that he knew well what was passing in the pagan camp , and how necessary swiftness and secrecy were to the success of his attack . Local traditions can not be much relied upon for events which took place a thousand years ago , but where there is clearly nothing improbable in them they are at least worth mentioning . We may note , then , that according to Somersetshire tradition , first collected by Dr. Giles ( himself a Somersetshire man , and one who , besides his Life of Alfred and other excellent works bearing on the time , is the author of the " Harmony of the Chroniclers , " published by the Alfred Committee in 1852 ) , the signal for the actual gathering of the West Saxons at Egbert 's Stone was given by a beacon lighted on the top of Stourton Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be hidden from the Danes , who must have been encamped about Westbury , by the range of the Wiltshire hills , while it would be visible to the west over the low country towards the Bristol Channel , and to the south far into Dorsetshire . Not an hour was lost by Alfred at the place of muster . The bands which came together there were // composed of men well used to arms , each band under its own alderman , or reeve . The small army he had himself been disciplining at Athelney , and training in skirmishes during the last few months , would form a reliable centre on which the rest would have to form as best they could . So after one day 's halt he breaks up his camp at Egbert 's Stone and marches to IEglea , now called Clay Hill , an important height , commanding the vale to the north of Westbury , which the Danish army were now occupying . The day 's march of the army would be a short five miles . Here the annals record that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promised that on the morrow his misfortunes would end . There are still traces of rude earthworks round the top of Clay Hill , which are said to have been thrown up by Alfred 's army at this time . If there had been time for such a work , it would undoubtedly have been a wise step , as a fortified encampment here would have served Alfred in good stead in case of a reverse . But the few hours during which the army halted on Clay Hill would have been quite too short time for such an undertaking , which , moreover , would have exhausted the troops . It is more likely that the earthworks , which are of the oldest type , similar to those at White Horse Hill , above Ashdown , were there long before Alfred 's arrival in May 878 . After resting one night on Clay Hill , Alfred led out his men in close order of battle against the pagan host , which lay at Ethandune . There has been much doubt amongst antiquaries as to the site // of Ethandune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claims of Edington , a village seven miles from Clay Hill , on the north-east to be the spot where the strength of the second wave of pagan invasion was utterly broken , and rolled back weak and helpless from the rock of the West Saxon kingdom . Sir John Spelman , relying apparently only on the authority of Nicholas IIarpesfeld 's " Ecclesiastical History of England , " puts a speech into Alfred 's mouth , which he is supposed to have delivered before the battle of Edington . IIe tells them that the great sufferings of the land had been yet far short of what their sins had deserved . That God had only dealt with them as a loving lather , and was now about to succour them , having already stricken their foe with fear and astonishment , and given him , on the other hand , much encouragement by dreams and otherwise . That they had to do with pirates and robbers , who had broken faith with them over and over again ; and the issue they had to try that day was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be established in England . There is no trace of any such speech in the Saxon Chronicle or Asser , and the one reported does not ring like that of Judas Maccabeus . That Alfred 's soul was on fire that morning , on finding himself once more at the head of a force he could rely on , and before the enemy he had met so often , we may be sure enough , but shall never know how the fire kindled into speech , if indeed it did so at all . In // such supreme moments many of the strongest men have no word to say ? keep all their heat within . Nor have we any clue to the numbers who fought on either side at Ethandune , or indeed in any of Alfred 's battles . In the Chronicles there are only a few vague and general statements from which little can be gathered . The most precise of them is that in the Saxon Chronicle , which gives 840 as the number of men who were slain , as we heard , with IIubba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year . Such a death-roll , in an action in which only a small detachment of the pagan army was engaged , would lead to the conclusion that the armies were far larger than one would expect . On the other hand , it is difficult to imagine how any large bodies of men could find subsistence in a small country , which was the seat of so devastating a war , and in which so much land remained still unreclaimed . But whatever the power of either side amounted to we may be quite sure that it had been exerted to the utmost to bring as large a force as possible into line at Ethandune . Guthrum fought to protect Chippenham , his base of operations , some sixteen miles in his rear , and all the accumulated plunder of the busy months which had passed since Twelfth Night ; and it is clear that his men behaved with the most desperate gallantry . The fight began at noon ( one chronicler says at sunrise , but the distance makes this impossible unless Alfred marched in the night ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warned by many pre126 ALFRED THE GREAT . vious disasters , the Saxons never broke their close order , and so , though greatly outnumbered , hurled back again and again the onslaughts of the Northmen . At last Alfred and his Saxons prevailed , and smote his pagan foes with a very great slaughter , and pursued them up to their fortified camp on Bratton Hill or Edge , into which the great body of the fugitives threw themselves . All who were left outside were slain , and the great spoil was all recovered . The camp may still be seen , called Bratton Castle , with its double ditches and deep trenches , and barrow in the midst sixty yards long , and its two entrances guarded by mounds . It contains more than twenty acres , and commands the whole country side . There can be tilde doubt that this camp , and not Chippenham , which is sixteen mites away , was the last refuge of Gutlrrurn and the great Northern army on Saxon soil . So , in three days from the breaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more king of all England south of the Thames ; for this army of Pagans shut up within their earthworks on Bratton Edge are little better than a broken and disorderly rabble , with no supplies and no chance of succour from any quarter . Nevertheless he will make sure of them , and above all will guard jealously against any such mishap as that of 876 , when they stole out of Wareham , murdered the horsemen he had left to watch them , and got away to Exeter . So Bratton Camp is strictly besieged by AIfred with his whole power . ' // Guthrum , the destroyer , and now the King , of East Anglia , the strongest and ablest of all the Northmen who had ever landed in England , is now at last fairly in Alfred 's power . At Reading , Wareham , Exeter , he had always held a fortified camp , on a river easily navigable by the Danish war-ships , where he might look for speedy succour , or whence at the worst he might hope to escape to the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , are shut up in an inland fort with no ships on the Avon , the nearest river , even if they could cut their way out and reach it , and no hopes of reinforcements over land . IIalfdene is the nearest viking who might be called to the rescue , and he , in Northumbria , is far too distant . It is a matter of a few days only , for food runs short at once in the besieged camp . In former years , or against any other enemy , Guthrum would probably have preferred to salty out , and cut his way through the Saxon lines , or die sword in hand as a son of Odin should . Whether it were that the wild spirit in him is thoroughly broken for the time by the unexpected defeat at Ethandune , or that long residence in a Christian land and contact with Christian subjects have shaken his faith in his own gods , or that he has learnt to measure and appreciate the strength a , nd nobleness of the man he had so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued . At the end of fourteen days he sends to Alfred , suing humbly for terms of any kind ; offering on the part of the army as many hostages as may be required , without asking for any in return ; once again giving solemn // pledges to quit Wessex for good ; and , above all , declaring his own readiness to receive baptism . If it had not been for the last proposal , we may doubt whether even Alfred would have allowed the ruthless foes with whom he and his people had fought so often , and with such varying success , to escape now . Over and over again they had sworn to him , and broken their oaths the moment it suited their purpose ; had given hostages , and left them to their fate . In all English kingdoms they had now for ten years been destroying and pillaging the houses of God , and slaying even women and children . They had driven his sister 's husband from the throne of Mercia , and had grievously tortured the martyr Edmund . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the men . When David smote the children of Moab , he " measured them with a line , casting them down to the ground ; even with two lines measured he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive . " When he took Rabbah of the children of Ammon , " he brought forth the people that were therein , and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron , and made them pass through the brick-kiln . " That was the old Hebrew method , even under King David , and in the ninth century Christianity had as yet done little to soften the old heathen custom of " woe to the vanquished . " Charlemagne 's proselytizing campaigns had been as merciless as Mahomet 's . But there is about this English king a divine patience , the rArest // of all virtues in those who are set in high places . He accepts Guthrum 's proffered terms at once , rejoicing over the chance of adding these fierce heathen warriors to the Church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must feel . And so the remnant of the army are allowed to march out of their fortified camp , and to recross the Avon into Mercia , not quite five months after the day of their winter attack , and the seizing of Chippenham . The Northern army went away to Cirencester , where they stayed over the winter , and then returning into East Anglia settled down there , and Alfred and Wessex hear no more of them . Never was triumph more complete or better deserved ; and in all history there is no instance of more noble use of victory than this . The West Saxon army was not at once disbanded . Alfred led them back to Athelney ; where he had left his wife and children ; and while they are there , seven weeks after the surrender , Guthrum , with thirty of the bravest of his followers , arrive to make good their pledge . The ceremony of baptism was performed at Wedmore , a royal residence which had probably escaped the fate of Chippenham , and still contained a church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldiers of a greater than Woden , and the white linen cloth , the sign of their new faith , was bound round their heads . Alfred himself was godfather to the viking , giving him the Christian name of Athelstan ; and the chrism-loosing , or unbinding of the saeramental cloths , was performed on the eighth day by 9 // Ethelnoth , the faithful Alderman of Somersetshire . After the religious ceremony there still remained the task of settling the terms upon which the victors and vanquished were hereafter to live together side by side in the same island ; for Alfred had the wisdom , even in his enemy 's humiliation , to accept the accomplished fact , and to acknowledge East Anglia as a Danish kingdom . The Witenagemot had been summoned to Wedmore , and was sitting there , and with their advice the treaty was then made , from which , according to some historians , English history begins . We have still the text of the two documents which together contain Alfred and Guthrurn 's peace , or the Treaty of Wedmore ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on before the capitulation of the Danish army at Ghippenham , the latter the final terms settled between Alfred and his witan , and Guthrum and his thirty nobles , after mature deliberation and conference at Wedmore , but not formally executed until some years later . The shorter one , that made at the capitulation , runs as follows : ALFRED AND GUTHRUM 'S PEACE . " This is the peace that King Alfred , and King Guthrum , and the witan of all the English nation and all the people that are in East Anglia , have all ordained and with oaths confirmed , for themselves and their descendants , as well for born as unborn , who reek of God 's mercy , or of ours . // " First , concerning our land boundaries . These are up on the Thames , and then up on the Lea , and along the Lea unto its source , then straight to Bedford , then up the Ouse to Watling Street . " Then there is this : if a man be slain we reckon all equally dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , except the churl who dwells on gavel land and their leisings ; they are also equally dear at 200 shillings . And if a king 's thane be accused of manslaughter , if he desire to clear himself let him do so before twelve king 's thanes . If any man accuse a man who is of less degree than king 's thane , let him clear himself with eleven of his equals and one king 's thane . And so in every suit which may be for more than four mancuses ; and if he dare not , let him pay for it threefold as it may be valued . Of Warrantors . " And that every man know his warrantor , for men , and for horses , and for oxen . " And we all ordained , on that day that the oaths were sworn , that neither bondman nor freeman might go to the army without leave , nor any of them to us . But if it happen that any of them from necessity will have trailie with us , or we with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed on this wise : that hostages be given in pledge of peace , and as evidence whereby it may be known that the party has a clean book . " By the treaty Alfred is thus established as king of // the whole of England south of the Thames ; of all the old kingdom of Essex south of the Lea , including London , Hertford , and St. Albans ; of the whole of the great kingdom of Mercia , which lay to the west of Watling Street , and of so much to the east as lay south of the Ouse . That he should have regained so much proves the straits to which he had brought the Northern army , who would have to give up all their new settlements round Gloster . That he should have resigned so much of the kingdom which had acknowledged his grandfather , father , and brothers as overlords , proves how formidable his foe still was , even in defeat , and how thoroughly the north-eastern parts of the island had by this time been settled by the Danes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be provisional , and intended to settle the relations between Alfred 's subjects and the army while it remained within the limits of the new Saxon kingdom . Many of the soldiers would have to break up their homes in Glostershire ; and , with this view , the halt at Cirencester is allowed , where , as we have already heard , they rest until the winter . While they remain in the Saxon kingdom there is to be no distinction between Saxon and Dane . The were-gild , or life-ransom , is to be the same in each case for men of like rank ; and all suits for more than four mancuses ( about twenty-four shillings ) , are to be tried by a jury of peers of the accused . On the other hand , only necessary communications are to be allowed between the Northern army and the people ; and // where there must be trading , fair and peaceful dealing is to be ensured by the giving of hostages . This last provision , and the clause declaring that each man shall know his warrantor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the contracting parties must hold to be of the very first importance would find place , is another curious proof of the care with which our ancestors , and all Germanic tribes , guarded against social isolation ? the doctrine that one man has nothing to do with another ? a doctrine which the great body of their descendants , under the leading of Schultze , Delitzsch , and others , seem likely to repudiate with equal emphasis in these latter days , both in Germany and England . Thus , in July 8i8 , the foundations of the new kingdom of England were laid , for new it undoubtedly became when the treaty of Wedmore was signed . The Danish nation , no longer strangers and enemies , are recognized by the heir of Cerdic as lawful owners of the full half of England . Having achieved which result , Guthrum and the rest of the new converts leave the Saxon camp and return to Cirencester at the end of twelve days , loaded with such gifts as it was still in the power of their conquerors to bestow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a greater and more arduous task than any he had yet encountered . // CHAPTER XI . RETROSPECT . " Whatsoever is brought on thee take cheerfully , and be patient when thou art changed to a low estate . For gold is tried in the fire , and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity . " THE great Danish invasion of England in the ninth century , the history of which we have just concluded , is one of those facts which meet us at every turn in the life of the world , raising again and again the deepest of all questions . At first sight it stands out simply as the triumph of brute force , cruelty , and anarchy , over civilization and order . It was eminently successful , for the greater part of the kingdom remained subject to the invaders . In its progress all such civilization as had taken root in the land was for the time trodden out ; whole districts were depopulated ; lands thrown out of cultivation ; churches , abbeys , monasteries , the houses of nobles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as then existed ) and works of art ruthlessly burnt and destroyed . It threw back all Alfred 's reforms for eight years . To the poor East Anglian , or Vest Saxon churl or monk who had been living his quiet // life there , honestly and in the fear of God , according ' to his lights , ? to him hiding away in the swamps of the forest , amongst the swine , running wild now for lack of herdsmen , and thinking bitterly of the sack of his home , and murder of his brethren , or of his wife and children by red-handed Pagans , the heavens would indeed seem to be shut , and the earth delivered over to the powers of darkness . Would it not seem so to us , if we were in like case ? Have we any faith which would stand such a strain as that ? Who shall say for himself that he has ? and yet what Christian does not know , in his heart of hearts , that there is such a faith , for himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred through those fearful years , and strengthened him to build up a new and better England out of the ruins the Danes left behind them ? For , hard as it must be to keep alive any belief or hope during a time when all around us is reeling , and the powers of evil seem to be let loose on the earth , when we look back upon these " days of the Lord " there is no truth which stands out more clearly on the face of history than this , that they all and each have been working towards order and life , that " the messengers of death have been indeed messengers of resurrection . " In the case of our fathers , in the England of a thousand years ago , we have not to go far to learn what the Danes had to do for them . There is no need to accept the statements of later writers as to the condition of the Saxons and Angles at the time of the invasion . Hoveden , after dwelling on the // wars which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early part of the ninth centuries , sums up , that in process of time all " virtue had so utterly disappeared in them that no nation whatsoever might compare with them for treachery and villany ; " and in John Hardyng 's rhymed Chronicle we find : " Thus in defaute of lawe and peace conserved Common profyte was wasted and devoured , Partial profyte was sped and observed , And Venus also was commonly honoured ? Among them was common , as the carte waye , Ryot , robbery , oppressyou , night and daye . " Such pictures are , no doubt , very highly coloured , and there is nothing in contemporary writers to justify them ; nor can we believe that a nation in so utterly rotten a state would have met the Danes as the Angles and West Saxons did . But without going farther than Alfred 's own writings , and the Saxon Chronicle and Asser , which contain , after all , the whole of the evidence at first hand which is left to us , we may see clearly enough that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbery , and oppression , night and day , " was settling on its lees . The country had become rich for those times under the long and vigorous rule of Egbert , and the people were busy and skilful in growing corn , and multiplying flocks and herds , and heaping up silver and gold . But the " common profyte " was more and more neglected , as " parcial profyte , " individual gain , came to be the chief object in men 's eyes . Then the higher life of // the nation began to be undermined . The laws were unjustly interpreted and administered by hereditary aldermen , who by degrees became almost independent of the king in their own shires and districts , in all matters not directly affecting his personal prerogative . The religious orders , who had been the protectors and instructors of the people , were tainted as deeply as the laity with the same self-seeking spirit . Alfred , in his preface to Gregory 's pastoral , speaks sorrowfully of the wise men who were found formerly throughout the English race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kings , and they who then had the government of the folk , " obeyed God and His messengers , and maintained their peace , their customs , and their government at home , and also increased their country abroad , and sped well both in war and wisdom " ? how the religious orders were " earnest , both about doctrine and learning , and the services of God , so that men from abroad sought instruction in this land , which we must now get from them if we would have it . " In Ethelwulf 's reign both evils must have grown rapidly , for he was careless of his secular duties , and left alderman , and reeve , and sheriff more and more to follow their own ways , while he fostered the worst tendencies of his clergy , encouraging them to become more and more priests and keepers of the conscience , and less shepherds and instructors of the people . So religion wasbeing separated from morality , and the inner and spiritual life of the nation was consequently dying out , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind . Their religion had become chiefly a matter of custom and routine ; and , as a sure consequence , a sensual and grovelling life was spreading through all classes . Soon material decay would follow , if it had not already begun ; for healthy , manly effort , honest and patient digging and delving , planting and building , is not to be had out of man or nation whose conscience has been put to sleep . When the corn and wine and oil , the silver and the gold , have become the main object of worship ? that which men or nations do above all things desire ? sham work of all kinds , and short cuts , by what we call financing and the like , will be the means by which they will attempt to gain them . When that state comes , men who love their country will welcome Danish invasions , civil wars , potato diseases , cotton famines , Fenian agitations , whatever calamity may be needed to awake the higher life again , and bid the nation arise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of fact is as clear as that in certain states of the atmosphere we have thunderstorms . The thunder-storm comes with perfect certainty , and as part of a natural and fixed order . We are all agreed upon that now . We all believe , I suppose , that there is an order , ? that there are laws which govern the physical world , asserting themselves as much in storm and earthquake as in the succession of night and day , of seed-time and harvest . We who are Christians believe that order and those laws to proceed from God , to be expressions of His will . Do we not also // believe that men are under a divine order as much as natural things ? that there is a law of righteousness founded on the will of God , as sure and abiding as the law of gravitation ? that this law of righteousness , this divine order , under which human beings are living on this earth , mast and does assert and vindicate itself through and by the acts and lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts itself through the agency of the invisible powers in earth and sea and air ? Surely Christianity , whatever else it teaches , at any rate assures us of this . And when we have made this faith our own , when we believe it , and not merely believe that we believe it , we have in our hand the clue to all human history . Mysteries in abundance will always remain . We may not be able to trace the workings of the law of righteousness in the confusions and bewi derments of our own day , or through the darkness and mist which shrouds so much of the life of other times and other races . But we know that it is there , and that it has its ground in a righteous will , which was the same a thousand years ago as it is to-day , which every man and nation can get to know ; and just in so far as they know and obey which will they be founding families , institutions , states , which will abide . If we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only to take any question which has troubled , or is troubling , statesmen and rulers and nations , in our own clay . The slavery question is one of the greatest of these . In the divine order that // institution was not recognised , there was no place at all set apart for it ; on the contrary , He on whose will that order rests had said that He came to break every yoke . And so slavery would give our kindred in America no rest , just as it would give us no rest in the first thirty years of the century . The nation , desiring to go on living its life , making money , subduing a continent , " Pitching new states as old-world men pitch tents , " tried every plan for getting rid of the " irrepressible negro " question , except the only one recognised in the divine order ? that of making him free . The ablest and most moderate men , the Websters and Clays , thought and spoke and worked to keep it on its legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lines " laid down , joint committees of both Houses ? at last even a " crisis committee , " as it was called ? invented plan after plan to get it fairly out of the way by any means except the only one which the eternal law , the law of righteousness , prescribed . But IIe whose will must be done on earth was no party to Missouri compromises , and Mason and Dixon 's line was not laid down on His map of North America . And there never were wanting men who could recognise His will , and denounce every compromise , every endeavour to set it aside , or escape from it , as a " covenant with death and hell . " Despised and persecuted men ? Garrisons and John Browns ? were raised up to fight this battle , with tongue and pen and life 's blood , the // weak things of this world to confound the mighty ; men who could look bravely in the face the whole power and strength of their nation in the faith of the old prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces ; gather yourselves together and it shall come to nought , for God is with us . " And at last the thunderstorm broke , and when it cleared away the law of righteousness had asserted itself once again , and the nation was delivered . And so it has been , and is , and will be to the end of time with all nations . We have all our " irrepressible " questions of one kind or another , more or less urgent , rising up again and again to torment and baffle us , refusing to give us any peace until they have been settled in accordance with the law of righteousness , which is the will of God . No clever handling of them will put them to rest . Such work will not last . If we have wisdom and faith enough amongst us to ascertain and do that will , we may settle them for ourselves in clear skies . If not , the clouds will gather , the atmosphere grow heavy , and the storm break in due course , and they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or desire , for it is " . the Lord 's controversy . " In due course ! perhaps ; but what if this due course means lifetimes , centuries ? Alas ! this is indeed the cry which has been going up from the poor earth these thousands of years " The priests and the rulers are swift to wrong , And the xnille of God are slow to grind . " // How long , 0 Lord , how long ? The precise times and seasons man shall never know on this earth . These the Lord has kept in His own power . But courage , my brother ! Can we not see , the blindest of us , that the mills are working swiftly , at least in our day ? This is no age in which shams or untruths , whether old or new , are likely to have a quiet time or a long life of it . In all departments of human affairs ? religious , political , social ? we are travelling fast , in England and elsewhere , and under the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and is able and willing to take care of it .

' THE KING 'S BOARD OF WORKS . 1 ) CHAPTER XII . THE PINGS BOARD OF WORKS . " Except the Lord build the house , their labour is but lost that build . " " Except the Lord keep the city , the watchman waketh but in vain . " IT is scarcely possible to exaggerate the amount and difficulty of the work which lay before A.fred there at Wedmore , when he had at last got fairly rid of Guthrum and the army , and was able to think about something else than prompt fighting . The witan was assembled there , and may probably have counselled their king on many parts of that work . We only know , that they considered and passed the Treaty of Wedmore , and forfeited the lands of certain nobles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The council would not have remained sitting a day longer than they could help , as it must hav been already getting towards harvest-time . They left their king , still young in years , but old in experience and thoughtfulness , to set about his work of building up the nation again as best it might please him . 1d 1 ALFRED THE GREAT . We can not doubt that with Athelney and Ethandune fresh in his mind , and Guthrum 's army still undisbanded at Cirencester , his first thought and care will have been of the defence of the realm for the future , and one of his first acts to commence the restoration of the forts and strong places . Dr. Giles points out the striking contrast in these early wars between the Saxons and Danes in their skill in the erection and use of fortifications . Through the whole of these wars the former seem scarcely ever able to hold a town or fort , if we except Cynuit ; while the Danes never lose one . At the beginning of each year of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of strong place , such as Nottingham , Reading , Exeter , Chippenham , apparently without difficulty , certainly with no serious delay ; but when once they are in it they are never dislodged by force . In the same way , none of their fortified camps , such as that at Wareham , were ever taken ; and the remains at Uflington Castle and Bratton Castle show how skilful they were in these military earthworks , and what formidable places the crests of hills on the open clowns became under their hands . Alfred never lost a hint , for he had a mind thoroughly humble , and therefore open to the reception of new truth ; so in setting to work to restore the forts which had been destroyed or damaged , we may . be sure he profited by the lessons of the great struggle . At what time , or in what order , the restoration took place , we have no hint . In this , as in almost all parts of Alfred 's work , we // only know the results . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wedmore and the next great war , which broke out in 893 , we may gather from the fact that the great leader of that invasion , Hasting , was never able to take an important town or stronghold . That terrible viking , who for years had been the scourge of the French coasts , was in this same autumn of 879 at Fulham . Dr : Pauli , who has remarkable sagacity in suggesting what the short vague notices in the Chronicles really mean , thinks that Hasting had been with Guthrum both at Ethandune and Chippenham , and from thence accompanied the beaten army to Cirencester . That after the return of the Danish king and his thirty nobles from their baptism at Wedmore , he left the army , taking with him his own followers , and all those of the army who refused to become Christians , and with these sailed round the south coast , and up the Thames to Fulham . On the other hand , after such a lesson of the power wielded by Alfred , and his capacity as a leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hasting would have been ready at once to open another campaign in Wessex . The Saxon Chronicle simply says that " a body of pirates drew together , and sat down at Fulham on the Thames ; " Asser , that " a large army of Pagans sailed from foreign parts into the river Thames , and joined the army which was already in the country . " On the whole , it seems more probable that Hasting ; or whoever was the leader of the Danes who wintered 10 // at Fulham in this year , came from abroad , and was joined there by the wild spirits from Guthrum 's army , the resolute Pagans and pirates to whom peaceful life was thoroughly distasteful . The greater part of that army certainly never left Cirencester till the next spring , and remained faithful to the terms of the Treaty of Wedmore . So the Danes at Fulham , seeing no chance of rousing their countrymen to another attempt on Alfred 's crown and kind dom , and witnessing through the autumn and winter months the vigour with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed away to Ghent . And from this time , for upwards of four precious years , no band of Pagans landed on English soil , and the whole land had rest , and King Alfred leisure to turn to all the great reforms that he had in his mind . So , for one thing , the rebuilding and strengthening of the fortresses all along the coast could now go on without hindrance . The whole of the bookland of England was held subject to the building of bridges and fortresses , and marching against an enemy , so that the whole manhood of the kingdom might have been at once turned upon this work . But Alfred had learned in the first years of his reign that his people would not well bear forcing ; moreover , he had new ideas on the subject of building ; was feeling his way towards the substitution of stone for wood-work , and importing the most skilled masons to be found on the Continent to instruct his own people . In his scriptural readings , too , he will have become acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wisest of monarchs , by the forced labour on his magnificent public works , exhausted the energies and alienated the affections of his people , an examp:e to be carefully avoided by a Christian king . Such of the strong places , then , on the coast and elsewhere as belonged to the King himself , rose steadily without haste and without pause from their ruins , with all the newest improvements which the best foreign workmen , or the experience of the ate war , could suggest . At first it did not fare so well with those which had to be entrusted to others , and nothing can give us a more vivid impression of the dead weight of indifference and stupidity which Alfred had to contend against in his early efforts than the passage in Asser which speaks of ' this business , of restoring these fortified places . It occurs under the year 887 , by which time it is plain , from the end of the passage , that the King had triumphed over all his difficulties , and had inspired the officers in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy . " What shad I say , " writes his faithful friend , " of the cities and towns which he restored , and of others which he built where none had been before ? of the royal halls and chambers wonderfully erected by his command , with wood and stone ? of the royal residences , constructed of stone , removed from their old sites , and handsomely rebuilt under his direction in more suitable places ? " probably where they were less open to assaults , such as those which had taken Reading and Chippenham . " Besides the disease // above mentioned , he was disturbed by the quarrels of his friends , who would voluntarily undergo little or no toil , though it were for the common need of the kingdom ; but he alone , sustained by the aid of Heaven , 1ike a skilful pilot strove to steer his ship laden with much wealth into the safe and muchdesired harbour , though almost all his crew were tired , and suffered them not to faint , or hesitate , though sailing amidst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his bishops , earls , nobles , favourite ministers and prefects , who , next to God and the king , had the whole government of the kingdom , as is fitting , continually received from him instruction , respect , exhortation , and command ? nay , at last , when they continued disobedient , and his long patience was exhausted , he would reprove them severely , and censure their vulgar folly and obstinacy ; and thus he directed their attention to his own will , and to the common interests of the kingdom . Owing , however , to the sluggishness of his people , these admonitions of the King were either not fulfilled , or begun late in the hour of need , and so fell out the less to the advantage of those who executed them . For I will say nothing of the castles which he ordered to be built , but which , being begun late , were never finished , because the enemy broke in upon them by sea and land , and , as often fell out , the thwarters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were ashamed at their non-performance of his commands . I speak of repentance when it is too late , " the good Bishop indignantly continues , " on // the testimony of Scripture , by which it appears that numberless persons have had cause for too much sorrow after many insidious evils have come to pass . But though by these means , sad to say , they may be bitterly afflicted and roused to sorrow by the loss of fathers , wives , children , ministers , servant-men , servant-maids , and furniture and household stuff , what is the use of hateful repentance , when their kinsmen are dead , and they can not aid them , or redeem those who are captive from captivity ? for they are not able even to assist those who have escaped , as they have not wherewith to sustain even their own lives . They repented , therefore , when it was too late , and grieved at their incautious neglect of the King 's commands , and praised the King 's wisdom with one voice , and tried with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is to say , the erection of castles , and other things generally useful to the whole kingdom . " A vivid picture , - truly , of the state of things in England a thousand years ago , for all of which might we not without much research find parallels enough in our own day ? One would fain hope that we are not altogether without some equivalent in late years for that patient , never-faltering pressure of the King , sometimes lighting up into scathing reproof of the " vulgar folly and obstinacy " of many of those through whom he has to work . It is refreshing to find a bishop , fairly roused by these squabbles ? this unreasoning sluggishness of men who called themselves the King 's friends , and should have been // doing the work he had appointed them ? denouncing the repentance of such , after the mischief has been done , as " hateful , " not a worthy act at all , or one likely to deserve the approbation of God or the King , in this bishop 's judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy by land and sea " upon the unfinished fortifications , must point to the years between 872 and 878 ; for from the date of the peace of Wedmore no strong place of the Saxons was taken during Alfred 's life . It was not until 885 that the Northmen even ventured on any descent in force on the coast of England . In that year the army which had gathered round the band of old heathen rovers who followed Ilasting from Fulham to Ghent in the spring of 880 , and had been ravaging the banks of the Meuse and the Scheldt ever since , after wintering at Amiens , at last broke in two . One half , under a leader whose name has not come down to us , took to their ships , and , in their old form , stole up the Thames and Medway , and made a sudden dash at Rochester . But now for the first time they were completely foiled in their first onslaught . They could not storm the pace , which was well fortified and gallantly held , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of taking the town by famine or storm before succour could arrive . In this , however , they were soon undeceived . Alfred appeared promptly in Kent at the head of a strong force , and , without awaiting his attack , the Danes fled to their ships , leaving great spoil which they had brought with them from // France , including a number of horses and prisoners , in their fortified camp before Rochester Gate . And so they betake themselves to France again , having found this visit to England very decidedly unprofitable . We may fairly conclude then , that by the year 885 those provoking bishops , earls , nobles , favourite ministers , and prefects , had come to their senses , and had learnt to obey their king 's commands , and to see that there was good reason for anything he might set them to work on . Thus , as the fruit of years of patient and steady pressure. , at last Alfred has his forts in order , a chain of them all round the southern coast some say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part sufficiently protected against sudden attack , so far as walls and ditches will secure them . London only still lies in a miserably defenceless state , all the best parts in ruins , the respectable inhabitants fled across seas or into Wessex ; and only a wild , lawless population , the sweepings of many nations and tribes , left to haunt the river side , picking up a precarious living , no one can tell how , and ready to join any band of marauders who might be making use of the deserted houses . The - great city which had been almost able to stand alone , and assert its independence of Mercia or of any overlord , ever since Ethelwulf 's time , has fallen to be a mere colony of ' long-shore men , gathering round changing bands of pirates . The city has been Alfred 's ever since the Treaty of Wedmore , and he has been no doubt carefully considering what can be // done , and preparing to deal with it ; but it is an arduous and expensive undertaking , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary coast defences ? have been completed . At length in 886 all his preparations are made , and he marches on London with a sufficient force to deal with such organized bands of Northmen as might for the time be holding it , and with the ' longshore population . Ethelwerd 's Chronicle speaks of a siege , and Huntingdon 's of a great force of Danes , ' who fled when the place was invested ; but the Saxon Chronicle and Asser contain no hint , either of a siege , or of any organized force within the city . It is probable therefore that London submitted to Alfred at once without a blow . Here , in what had been even in Roman times the great commercial capital of England , his splendid organizing talents had full scope during the year . The accounts in the best authorities agree entirely as to this work of 886 . They are short and graphic . " In this year Alfred , King of the West Saxons , after the burning of cities and slaying of the people honourably rebuilt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave it into the custody of his son-in-law Ethelred , alderman of Mercia ; to which king all the Angles and Saxons who before had been dispersed everywhere , or were in bondage under the Pagans , voluntarily turned , and submitted themselves to his dominion . " The foreign masons and mechanics , of whom Alfred by this time had large numbers in his regular pay , made swift work with the rebuilding of // London ; and within a few years , under Ethelred 's rule , the city had regained its old pre-eminence . Saxons , Angles , and Danes thronged to it indiscriminately , the latter occupying their own quarters . A colony of them settled on the southern side of the river , and built Southwark ( Syd virke , the southern fortification ) , where one ' of the principal thoroughfares , Tooley Street ( a corruption of St. Olave 's Street ) , still bears the name of the patron saint of Norway . On the northern side of the Thames also , to the west of the city , they established another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named it St. Clement Danes . We may reckon the rebuilding and resettlement of London as the crowning act of the King 's work as a restorer of the fenced cities of his realm , and have now to follow him , as well as the confused materials at our command will allow us , in other departments no less difficult to handle than this of the Board of Works , in which his wise and unflagging energy was bringing order out of chaos , and economizing and developing the great resources of his kingdom . // CHAPTER XIII . THE KINGS WAR OFFICE AND ADMIRALTY . " And I took the chief of your tribes , wise men and known , and made them heads over you , captains over hundreds , and captains over fifties , and captains over tens , and officers amongst your tribes . " THE restoration of all the old fortresses of the kingdom , and the building of a number of fresh ones , though apparently the work which Alfred thought of first , and pressed on most vigorously , was after all only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent organization of his army and navy . This also he took in hand at once , going straight to the root of the matter , as indeed was always the habit with this king , his whole nature being of a thoroughness which would never allow him to work only on the surface . It is by no means easy to understand the military organization of the West Saxons before Alfred 's reign , if indeed they had anything that may be called an organization . That every freeman was liable to a call to arms whenever the country was threatened by an enemy , or the king was bent on invading his neighTHE // hour 's territory ? and that the king had no force of his own , but was in the hands of his aldermen and earls , and obliged to rely on what force they could . bring together ? this seems clear enough , but unfortunately we have no means of knowing with any accuracy how the call was made , what were the penalties for disobeying it , or the conditions of service in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rations , or had to support himself . So far as we can gather from the meagre accounts of the wars in Ethelwulf 's and Ethelred 's reign , and of Alfred 's early campaigns , as soon as danger threatened the hereditary alderman of the shire nearest the point of attack summoned all freeholders within his jurisdiction , and took the field at once , while the king , through their aldermen , gathered troops in other shires , and brought them up to the scene of action as fast as he could . Thus in 861 the Aldermen Osric and Ethelwulf , with the men of Rants and Perks , fell at once upon the pillagers of Winchester without waiting for King Ethelbert ; and again Ethelwulf , ten years later , in 871 , fights the battle of Engleficid with the first division of the Danish army from Reading , only three days after the arrival of the Pagans , before Ethelred and Alfred can come up . More instances might he cited , if needed , to show that either the penalties on slackness in coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Saxons for fighting was of the strongest . As a rule , the men of the shire might evidently be relied on to meet the first brunt of attack . It is equally clear that these levies could // not be depended upon for any lengthened time . They dwindled away after a few weeks , or months , on the approach of harvest or the failure in supplies , or zeal . In short , the system was practically , to a great extent , a voluntary one , and very uncertain in its operation , throwing altogether unfair burdens now on this district , now on the other , as the Pagans gained a fortified position in Berkshire , Dorsetshire , or Wiltshire . During his early campaigns Alfred must have seen the disadvantage at which he and the West Saxons were placed by this haphazard system , and have gradually matured the changes which he was now able to introduce . These were somewhat as follow . The whole fighting strength of the kingdom was divided into three parts or companies . Of these , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on duty , " night and day , for one month , after which they returned to their homes , and were relieved by the second company . At the end of the second month , in the same way , the third company relieved the second , who returned to their homes , where they spent two months , " until their turn for service came round again . No military service was required of any man beyond three months in the year , so that during the three winter months neither of the three military companies was on duty . Of the company on duty for the time being , a portion was told off for the defence of the principal fortresses , and the remainder constituted a body-guard or standing army , moving about under arms with the King and court . This at least is the account which has come down // to us , but it is obviously incomplete or incorrect . It is quite impossible that a third of the fighting strength of the whole kingdom could have been constantly maintained under arms by Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times of his father and brothers , there can be little doubt that he both maintained and paid his soldiers . This appears from his own writings , as well as from the chroniclers . After declaring that he had never much yearned after earthly power , the King goes on ( in the interpolation in the seventeenth chapter of his translation of Boethius ) : " Nevertheless I was desirous of materials for the work which I was commanded to perform ; that is , that I might honourably and fitly exercise the power which was entrusted to me . Moreover , no man can show any skill , or exercise or control any power , without tools and materials ; that is , of every craft the materials without which man can not exercise the craft . This , then , is a king 's material , and his tools to reign with ? that he have his land well peopled . He mast have bead-men and soldiers and workmen ; without these tools no king can show his craft . This is also his material that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three classes . This is then their provision ; land to live on , and pay , and weapons and meat , and ale , and clothes , and whatsoever is necessary for the three classes . He can not without these preserve the tools , or without the tools accomplish any of those things which he is commanded to perform . Therefore I was desirous of materials wherewith to exercise the power , that my work and // the report thereof should not be forgotten or hidden . For every craft and every power soon becomes old , and is passed over in silence , if it be without wisdom . Because whatsoever is done through folly no one can ever reckon for craft . This I will now truly say , that while I have lived I have striven to live worthily , and after my life to leave to the men who were after me my memory in good works . " I could not touch the passage without quoting it whole ; for , while treading on dangerous ground , it seems to me to vindicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to throw a gleam of light on his brave and pious life which we can not spare . " Kind craft " in the mouth of James I. meant the professional cleverness of the sovereign ? that cunning , a substitute for courage , by which he , as king , could gain his selfish ends and exalt his office , as he understood it . A contemptible , not to say hateful meaning , which the phrase has retained ever since in England . Alfred 's idea of kingeraft is " a work which he is commanded to perform , " which it is woe to him if he fail in performing . The two ideas are as wide apart as the character and work of the two kings . But the evidence does not rest on this passage . Asser , speaking of the division which the King made of his income , says that one-third of the part which he devoted to secular purposes went to pay his soldiers and ministers ; and Florence , that " he gave the first portion of his income yearly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inclined to reckon Alfred 's // income , it is quite impossible to suppose that one-sixth of it could have found weapons , meat , ale , and clothes , as well as pay , for anything like a third of his available force . It is probable , then , that only a small part of the company whose turn it might be for active service were actually called out , and kept under arms , either with the court , or in the fortresses . These were paid by the King , while the remainder of the company were not paid , unless they too were actually called out , though during their month they were no doubt constantly exercised , and kept in readiness to muster at any moment . It is not , however , of much importance , even if it were possible to ascertain the precise detail of Alfred 's military reforms . The essence and result of them is clear enough ; namely , that he had always a full third of his whole force ready to act against an enemy at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service were equally distributed over the whole kingdom . Side by side with the fortifications of his coasttowns , and the re-organization of his land-forces , the King pushed on with energy the construction of such a navy as would enable him to beat the Northmen on their own element . We have seen that , early in his first short interval of peace , he was busy with this work , having no doubt even then satisfied himself that his kingdom could only be effectually defended by sea . In 875 he puts to sea for the first time , and fights his first naval battle with success , taking one of the sea-king 's ships . This will have given him a
