 | THE WEST IN THE ORIENT III ? THE TRANSFORMATION OF TRANSPORTATION BY CHARLES M. PEPPER WITH the limitless desert we associate the caravan . Its mention brings before our mental vision the image of the long line of humped animals silhouetted in the clear atmosphere and swinging forward with rhythmic if ungraceful motion . We think of these common carriers as in Abraham 's time . In Western lands the change from burros and the mule pack-trains seems natural enough ; we should expect that the puffing locomotive of the steam railway would follow their trail over the mountains , through gorges and canyons , across valleys , and finally obliterate it . A score of such changing pictures rise before our eyes , and in reading of transportation improvements , the straightening of curves , the lessening of grades , the shortening of routes , we recall how literally the pioneer railroad builders followed the trails . In these days we seldom see a pack-train without wondering how long it will be till the railway line replaces it . Yet how rarely the sight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wound across the billow-v seas of sandy plains ; what is there to suggest that they will not continue to carry the commerce of arid regions for ages still to come ? First , then , the motor car is to be reck oned with in the transformation of transportation . It is used by British engineers and military officers in the Soudan . Various Egyptian desert roads are available for it . On the edges of the Sahara long automobile trips are not infrequent . Some use will develop for passengers , some for mail and prob  | ably also for light freight . But it will not supplant the camel caravans or anticipate the railway lines . Its functions have not reached that point . We feel nothing incongruous in the sight of a big red motor car , a roadster carrying its load of engineers across the waste stretches of Egypt and the Soudan or the edges of the Sahara , for we associate this vehicle with the personality of its occupants . But the locomotive and the chain of cars are associated with the landscape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the regions of drifting sands than do the trailing column of smoke , the fire-spitting engine , and the loosely jointed train . In the Orient , too , another reason for this fixedness is discoverable . We do not identify Mohammedan countries with material progress ; the politico-religious basis of Islam is against change . Mohammedanism born and nurtured in the sandy wilds and stony wastes of Arabia still lives and blossoms freshest amid arid surroundings , so that we might say it is the religion of the desert . Our conception of it is of tapering minarets and bulbous domes of the mosque in the cities of the sterile countries ; of nomads moving as they list ; of Bedouin tent-life with impassive and impressive sheiks ; of swift and beautiful horses ; in short , of existence unconfined . It is not a life likely to take an impression from alien civilizations as if it were wax . Some observers have said that if the Moslem Orient yields to the impact of a civilization that is represented by the railway , this will come not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on of the rod of the West . Yet this assumption is not supported by present tendencies . The awakening of the Mohammedan world is not entirely from without . Nor is it a rapid , buoyant , aggressive arousing ; instead there are lapses into drowsiness , spells of apathy . Yet in spite of lethargic moods the Ottoman Empire is vibrating with two twentieth century railway projects which are metamorphosing the camel caravans into puffing locomotives . Similar in motives the conditions surrounding them are widely  | different . One is profoundly religious and political or dynastic ; the other is fundamentally commercial and political . They converge and cross ; there is an intermingling of results if not of purposes . The railroad to Mecca , better known as the Hamidieh-Hedjaz or pilgrim line , has its inspiration in religious zeal , even fanaticism ; the Bagdad Railway is a commercial enterprise with political consequences in its intention and in its wake . In some respects the projects are alike . There is a topographical unity of the country which comprises Asiatic Turkey or that part of Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity in its history , for it includes the Assyrian and Babylonian Empires of antiquity with the vassal appanagesof Svria and Phoenicia and the always semi-independent Arabia . There is similarity in the physical conditions , for in both projects the desert tracts to be crossed are wide . The land that is to be of the rail , in terms of modern geographical description includes Syria , Palestine and the Arabian Penin-@#  | sula , Asia Minor and Mesopotamia . Their water boundaries are historic from the very dawn of human annals . There is the Mediterranean or the Great Sea as the Egyptians denominated it ; the Bosphorus and the Red Sea . The watercourses , too , are of the biblical past ? the fourth head of the river that went out of Eden , the eastern boundary of the Promised Land , the river on which Babylon was built , called The Flood , that is the Euphrates ; and the stream on which the Assyrian capital Nineveh was built , that is the Tigris . The non-commercial line , the HamidiehHedjaz Railway , revives the sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahomet . Its real starting place is at Haifa , the Mediterranean port under the lee of convent-crowned Mt . Carmel , where Elijah gathered to him all Israel and the prophets of Baal and confuted their false gods by himself bringing down fire from Heaven . Here , too , is the brook Kishon where he slew the priests of Baal . The railway route is through the plain of Esdraelon , past Nazareth and across Galilee and along the sweet and tranquil waters of Lake Tiberias with the Mount of Beatitudes in the background ; through the canyon of the river Hieromiax and up into the cultivated plains of the Hauran . The scenes are still scriptural except that the the Orient 311 uniformed boatmen of the excursion companies and the steam launches on the Sea of Galilee have a modernizing effect which is not entirely atoned for by the fishermen fishing from their boats as in the time of the Saviour . I took this journey starting on a black winter 's morning and finding place in the third-class passenger coach among the Bedouins , Arab pilgrims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train crew , dragomen , and mail sacks . The promise of tourist travel had not then become sufficiently alluring to secure better accommodation . But though the car was uncomfortably crowded by the mix-up of the Arabs and Bedouins with their guns and belts , their turbans , their striped blankets of black and white and their tunics ; they made room for the stranger with all the formal courtesy of their traditions . The railway may transform the desert ; the railway coach does not destroy the desert dweller 's sense of hospitality . The mail distribution was primitive ; long waits of the train while the carriers from beyond Lake Tiberias received their packets , receipted for them by affixing their signet seals and exchanged gossip . There were packages , even newspaper bundles , and letters with superscriptions in Arabic , French and English . I wondered if they  | had rural free delivery or through mails in the time of the patriarchs , and then recalled that communications were exchanged between Senemur , the Egyptian king , and Delebaras , the Assyrian monarch . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the grazing and farming districts and noted that the black tent roofs of the Bedouins were taking the place of the mud cabins , while the horsemen , sometimes solitary and sometimes in groups of twos and threes , became more common . The mountains encircling Galilee are not very lofty and there are natural openings in them . Nevertheless the railway location requires the grades to be climbed by many bold elliptical curves , and the ascent is shown by the nearness of the treeless mountain tops . Many tunnels are bored and there are a large number of stone bridges as well as some of iron and steel . The railway construction is an excellent monument to German substantiality , for the line was built by Germans . It was they who in building this railroad bridged the Jordan . In the early afternoon we were in the fertile plain of Hauran , whose richness was evidenced by the cascades that spill the water over the cliffs . It had taken from four o'clock in the morning till two in the afternoon to make the journey of zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was yet in the experimental stage . Many persons refused to travel on it at all because , as they thought , the roadbed had not been sufficiently settled and there was danger of landslides , washouts , insecure bridges , derailment and plunges into the gorges . But I had found no fault with the creeping pace of the train . Every section had offered its own variety of landscape , every unexpected stop had given glimpses of a strange and isolated life . Now we were content with the signs of good land we saw around us , the flocks and grazing herds , the villages with their mud mosques , the bullocks plowing the fields , the harvested wheat and barley piled in bags , the signs of the early spring planting ; it was all biblical and Oriental and the slow-moving caravan outlined against the crimson sky was a reminder , too , that the desert encroached on the alluvial plain . When we found our train backing into @#  | De'era over a network of switches and Ys we noted the roundhouse , the repair-shops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacious restaurant , with big signs in English telling that tea could be had . The up-train from Ma'an was just in . A company of dusty soldiers were alighting ; half a dozen dusty passengers were making for the eating-house ; an English traveller with grimy face and sandy red heard whitened by the dust was grumbling . Some Mohammedan women were shaking the dust from their voluminous dresses until it rose in clouds ; the engineer , a German , sooty with commingled oil and smoke , was giving orders to his grinning Arab fireman . The down-train from Damascus was just pulling across the Y from Mezrib . So here at De'era was the modern railway junction ? change cars from or for Haifa , Damascus , or Ma'an and beyond . Our route is not important , but while proceeding on it we may reN iew this railway to Mecca . Frequently it is called the Damascus-Mecca Line , and Damascus is assumed to be the starting point . But to reach Damascus Moslem pilgrims from northern and western countries must come to Beirut , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchfulness of the Powers . They must pass through Lebanon , which , while subject to the Porte , has its own semi-independent existence guaranteed . These incidents are not pleasant to devout Mussulmans , and though Damascus is the historic starting place for the pilgrimage , and was so with reason before the railway line from Haifa was built , its importance will be lessened since the pilgrims from Western lands can enter at Haifa , which is thoroughly and distinctively Mohammedan , and can pursue their way without too much contagion of unbelievers . But it is only seventy-five miles from Damascus to De'era , and , since the Haifa line is joined there , perhaps this junction place would better be taken as the beginning of the line for Medina and Mecca . The distance from either Haifa or Damascus to Mecca may be stated roughly at 1,150 to 1,18o miles . The project of building this 1,150 miles of narrow-gauge railway has been of gradual unfolding . The French system from Damascus to Mezrib and the French concession for prolongations along this route were taken over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locating was done by the French  | engineers , though the actual construction from Haifa has been in the hands of the Germans . The government is building the line out of its own funds and is employing its soldiers as laborers , but the voluntary contributions from devout Mohammedans the world over have exceeded $3,000,000 . The opening ceremonies were held at Ma'an on September I , 1904 , the anniyersary of the Sultan Abdul Hamid 's accession to the throne . They were attended by many high military and civil officials from Constantinople , Beirut , Damascus , a delegation from Medina and the personal representatives of the Sultan , whose message was conveyed and to whom greetings were sent . There was an oration , prayer by the mufti of Damascus , military manoeuvers by the Turkish troops , displays of horsemanship by the Bedouins , and at night fireworks . Medals were struck in honor of the occasion , showing on one side the Ottoman coat of arms and a locomotive and on the other side the inscription , " In commemoration of the opening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of the Mohammedan era ) ; and , O tribute to the most potential of Western instruments of progress ! the proceedings were reported by the special correspondents of the Constantinople newspapers. * From De'era to Ma'an the Palestine plateau slopes into the sands of Arabia , and there is little else but desert . The railway location is through that sacred and fascinating region east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea . The rock-hewn Petra of the Edomites with its Pharaohs ' treasure-house , the crossroads where the ancient caravans from @# Persia and India met those from Egypt and Syria , is within convenient distance for " routing " tourists . The engineering construction presents no striking features . When an'American engineer discovered that in places water could he had by artesian borings , the difficulties of the working forces were simplified . After the line reached Ma'an and the opening ceremonies were held the progress of the work was not continuous . The spirit of Oriental indifference and the resolution of Western character as embodied in @#  | the German contractors , were often in conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A large quantity of these rails came from the New World West , for they were shipped from Sparrow 's Point , Maryland . It was a question whether the ultra devout Mussulmans would use this modern convenience ; whether the hardships of the travel on foot and by camel caravans , the toll paid the robber bands of Bedouins , were not one of the necessary elements in the sacredness of the pilgrimage . But so fast as the line has been opened it has been patronized , and the number of pilgrims has increased . Wealthy Moslems supplied @#  | themselves with all the luxuries of first-class railroad travel , and by orders of the Sultan the indigent pilgrims who could not afford to pay fare were carried free . In 1906 the pilgrims travelled by rail from Damascus to Alakhzar , the other side of Tabouk , 560 miles south of Damascus . The Tourney to Tabouk only required thirty-six hours . It was here that the Prophet prepared to battle with the Romans , and a mosque has been erected at the place where he prayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each special train had its prayer car or mosque on wheels , in which the five daily prayers were performed regularly without stopping the train . Medina was reached after a journey by rail and road of twelve days , as against the thirty days formerly required . In 1907 the pilgrims were able to travel by the railway a section further on the extension beyond Tabank and to shorten the time still more . We may assume that by carrying on construction from Medina to meet the oncoming line , Mahomet 's burial place , the scene of so much that relates to the Prophet 's history , will have through railway communication with Damascus by 1910 , as promised . Then it will be settled whether the shrewd Arabs who began speculating in desert real estate , and so persistently forced the prices up , were justified . And here is one justification for the Arab land speculator ? Medina will be something more than @# a way-station . It will be an important head of a division . When the main trunk reaches Medina we may be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line to Mecca , which has been sanctioned by the Sultan , built for them . Then how long will it be till the pilgrimages are moved by rail the 280 miles from Medina and from Jeddah to Mecca also ? I do not know . Some observers , hopeful of the constructive element in the Turkish Government developing unexpected strength , say as early as 191 2 . A few years does not matter . When the rails were laid beyond De'era to Ma'an it meant that they one day would reach @#  | the religious capital of Islam . No circumstance can permanently stay their advance . It is fated that the locomotive shall enter Mecca , for its impelling power is that motive of all action in the East ? Religion . We may look forward confidently to the time when the shrieking engines shall draw in the long lines of pilgrim excursion trains and disembark their thousands of True Believers to become the prey of the moutamifs or lodginghouse keepers and the hackmen . In our imagination we may see the zealots among them hastening to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wav to the sacred black stone in the centre of the Kaaba mosque , hurrying through the prescribed observance for those about to perform Tawaf ; moving the seven times around the black stone while shouting the prayers , and then rushing forth and becoming an atom though a unit in the mass of 100,000 devotees facing the Kaaba , who bend the forehead to the earth . Perhaps their next move will be to join a pilgrimage out to Mozdalfa ? to spend the night in meditation and prayer and the next morning to move on to Mina , there to take part in stoning the three devils , seven stones for each Satan . Or perhaps they will first visit the holy well of Zemzem , and , after drinking of its waters , dip into their holy depths the strips of white cloth which will one day be used as their shrouds.  | Will one of the results of this pilgrim railwav be that others than True Believers , tourists among them , will enter Mecca and witness the ceremonies in which the pilgrimage culminates ? Its purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all parts of the globe have been to unite and strengthen Islam . Yet there have been leaders of orthodox Islam , travelled , intelligent , and familiar with the aggressive tendencies of the Western world ? that is the Christian world ? who have seen in this railway the fuse to a mine that will shatter , if not the faith of the Prophet , at least the political power which is so interwoven with that faith . Fanatics in the sandy wildernesses of Africa have had the same fear . The doubters among the Mussulmans see the shadow of a European nation , England or Germany , lengthening over Mecca . The Englishman himself is not averse to the suggestion . He points to the 6o,000,000 Mohammedan subjects in India as evidence of England 's ability to govern and guide an antagonistic religion . But there are also elements in the railway which promise to increase the Sultan 's political power by strengthening his claim to sovereignty over Arabia . Many sections of the line have been built only by the sufferance of the Bedouin tribes who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash subsidies instead . Gradually this kind of persuasion will cease and , moreover , the railway becomes an important line of military communication and a base for army movements . It will keep the route open for troops and will enable aggressive operations to be conducted against the rebellious tribes of the Yemen . There is a commercial side also . The desert does not fatten commerce , but increased travel facilities across it enhance traffic and the supplying of the pilgrims in itself creates freight . And even in a wilderness , when means of transporting products are afforded , the products appear . There are the date palms , for example , and coffee and hides and goatskins . Traffic is ' certainly expected to develop along the Hedjaz Railway , else Boo freight cars had not been provided in the beginning . There will be closer intercourse with the Western world and some enlarged trade as a result of changing the means of transportation in this borderland of the Arabian desert . The Bagdad Railway raises no question of undermining the influence of Islam , except such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Turkish Empire to twentieth century civilization . Geographically , commercially , and politically its sphere is wider than that of the Mecca Railway . It contemplates a connecting line of 2,000 miles uniting the great sea of the Rising Sun , or the Persian Gulf , with the upper ocean of the Setting Sun , as the Assvrian monarch Tiglath Pileser called the Mediterranean ; the Bosphorus with the Tigris , the Asia Minor of the Seven Churches with the Chaldea , the Assyria , the Babylon , and the Mesopotamia that were before the Seven Churches existed . From Constantinople to Bagdad the distance is about 1,500 miles , with the 600 miles to Eregli already built. * Like Damascus , the capital of the caliphs is a city with a continuous history , though the history runs back not so far . The glamour of Persian culture is over it . And then , too , Scheherezade 's tomb is there , and , when we shall step from the train in the city of the Arabian Nights , visions of Haroun al Raschid , the Caliphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tailor , and the Thieving Olive Merchant will pass before us . But our present vision is of the conditions surrounding the construction of the railway . We are reasonably familiar with the geography of the Asia Minor and Syria of today , yet we do not always fix their relation to the ancient caravan routes of commerce and the lines of march for troops . The overland trade route from the Persian Gulf through Asia to Europe is similar to that followed by the ancient caravans which made a detour of 25o miles in the journey to Damascus by way of Aleppo and the Orontes , traversing the Mesopotamia desert between Hit and Balis and leaving the Tigris above Bagdad . The shortest route to Bagdad and the Persian Gulf is not the one that furnishes the most encouragement for a railway . From Damascus to Bagdad , as the crow flies , is about 500 miles . This was the Syrian desert route via Tadmor or Palmyra and Thapsacus on the Euphrates . It offered small trade or agricultural advantages , its chief value being as a passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could be moved rapidly , as was done by Nebuchadnezzar in his forced march to make sure of his throne . In the present day this is a favorite way of travel for camping parties of tourists who would enjoy to their utmost the incomparable Syrian sun , and it is also the short cut for the Government fast mail , the swift riding dromedary , counterpart of the pony express of pioneer days in the United States , which carries correspondence from Damascus to Bagdad in nine days . The line of location for the Bagdad system traverses the regions of antiquity which enjoyed the greatest natural fertility and those whose crops were wrung from unbounteous nature by the artificial means of irrigation ? Assyria , Chaldea , the Babylonia that absorbed them both , including the alluvial tracts towards the mouth of the Euphrates and the Tigris , the two great rivers of western Asia . Whatever location an international railway connecting Europe and Asia may take it will be over historic routes of commerce that the camel caravans have followed for centuries . Koniah usually is taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point at which the German concessionaires who acquired the Anatolian Railroad began the constuction of the line ; but the real beginnings are at the seaports of the Levant where the Orient and the Occident meet . Across from Constantinople , in sight of the Golden Horn and the grouped masts of the vessels flying the flags of all the maritime nations of the world , is the new port of Haidar Pasha on the Asiatic mainland , with modern quays , huge elevators and warehouses , electric cranes for loading and unloading grain rapidly , and all the latest hoisting improvements for transferring cargoes . In the railroad yards are not only the freight trains but passenger coaches fitted with Westinghouse air-brakes and all manner of electrical appliances . The German engine pulls out a very comfortable train for Koniah and farther on . Crossing the ferry  | from the old bridge you may look back on twelve centuries of history in Stamboul when in the early morning you get the sunrise view of its 300 mosques . But there is another turnstile of traffic through which East and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smyrna , Homer 's birthplace , the city of figs , a commercial mart when Constantinople was not . Here is the mingling of races and religions more Hellenic than Turkish or Arabic , a vast shipping centre and , unlike Constantinople , situated on the Asiatic mainland and therefore a natural terminus or starting point for an Asiatic railroad . The camel caravans may be seen in Smyrna 's narrow and hilly streets to-day bearing their burdens as they have borne them for centuries , bringing products from the interior and carrying back the output of Western looms . But the caravans are not so numerous as formerly , because transportation in this section of Asia Minor has been in transformation during several years and two railway systems spread ou from the seaboard . One of these joins the Anatolian Railway at Afion Kara Hissari , and thus Smyrna will be in direct railway communication with Bagdad . Damascus and Aleppo are connected by a railroad which will be a branch or a spur of the main trunk of the Bagdad line that will pass to the north of Aleppo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German capitalists to whom the concessions were granted secured considerable latitude in the matter of routes and branches . But the location line most favored , beginning at Koniah , will cross the tablelands and mountains of Carmania , the Taurus Range , and running northeast through the Djihan Valley and the mountain region of Ghwair Dagh , across the Bogtche Gorge , will turn south and southeast through the passes to Tel Habesch , thirty-seven miles north of Aleppo . The Cilician Gates summit of the Taurus range can be surmounted at 3,500 feet and the crest of the Ghwair Dagh can be tunneled 1,000 feet lower . Leaving Tel Habesch the railway will run in an easterly direction and cross the Euphrates near Europus , whence it will take a southeasterly course across upper Mesopotamia to the Tigris at Mossul , opposite the site of the Nineveh that ceased to be 3,000 years ago , and will continue along the river bank to Bagdad , cornpeting with the present means of transportation , which is by rafts of inflated sheepskin . A branch to Chanekin on the Persian frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic that might be had from the Shiite Mohammedans of Persia in their pilgrimages to the holy city of Kerbela , and also from the transportation of the corpses of the faithful whose wishes to be buried at Kerbela are piously fulfilled . The continuation of the route from Bagdad will be along the Tigris to Basoorah or Busra , on the navigable waters of the Gulf . But the real head of ocean navigation is at Koweit , which is outside of the admitted Turkish dominion and within the sphere of British control . Hence the international complications and " world questions . " It is evident that two agencies must be combined to insure the completion of the railway . These are government aid and the commerce to be created by the development of resources . Since for strategic reasons the later plans have caused the route to be deviated from some of the most promising agricultural regions and centres of population to the arid tracts , this furnishes ground for the concessionaires to insist on substantial cash aid from the Turkish Government in the form of a fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oil exploitation , of agricultural monopolies and of installations of electricity and other industrial enterprises are broad enough to justify a reasonable expenditure of capital if only to determine their real worth . Some of the German engineers who made preliminary surveys for the railway location reported on these possibilities with a warmth of imagination that was Oriental rather than Teutonic . Soberly considered , the prospect of cotton culture in Western Asia seems to warrant the opening up of considerable areas to cultivation . But the chief agricultural wealth to be developed is of the grain fields . Cognate to this development is the restoration of the ancient irrigation , and this is dependent on railway construction . For the restoration of the old irrigation system and the building of the railway the appeal is to the West . Professor Sayce , disputing the claim of Egypt , tells us that the Babylonian region was where irrigation and river engineering were originally developed . Of the As-e  | Syrian 's country we are told on higher authority that " The waters made him great ; the deep set him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants and sent out her little rivers into all the trees of the field . " Rawlinson has shown the prodigal productiveness of the Babylonian wheatfields . We know that the plains between the Euphrates and the Tigris and the bordering regions towards Media and Persia and towards Arabia nurtured large masses of population , else those conquering empires could not have existed through the @# @# centuries and extended their dominions as they did . We know also that much of this prosperity was from the desert subdued and reclaimed . We do not have to do here with theories of the origin of the irrigation canals of these ancient empires , though historically we may feel assured that the beginnings were under the Chaldean monarchy 2,100 years before Christ and that . whoever built the great Nahrawan canal , a careful system of irrigation prevailed from remote times . The many remains of ancient watercourses in Mesopotamia at  | some distance from the main streams are satisfying evidence that the system had advanced far beyond the primitive stages . We may come down to the comparatively recent times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great canal builders and irrigation engineers who came after Joseph acid who may have drawn wisdom from what he had seen of the Nile works . He is a commanding personality in the ancient world , this Nebuchadnezzar II , who in the judgment of modern investigators built the Kerez Sandih canal , 400 miles long ; constructed a reservoir 140 miles round , and 140 feet deep ; dug channels connecting the Euphrates and the Tigris and extended the use of irrigation along the southwestern or Arabian frontier . Before him Sennacherib , the shipbuilder who brought the ships in pieces by caravan across from Tyre , had confined the Tigris to its banks by building an embankment of bricks , and had constructed canals or aqueducts to bring good water to the Assyrian capital . But the military exploits of Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar live after them because theirs was an age of the human race when deeds of destruction by arms were accounted of greater consequence than works of sustenance , such as irrigation . The Euphrates and the Tigris region in the twentieth century awaits the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be from the West , but he will not come until the railway brings him , for irrigation and railway construction are both essential to the development of this region . Nebuchadnezzar 's twentieth century successor will have to study the story which the ruins of the ancient irrigation works may tell , because he will need to draw lessons from them . Of course he will have his own theory of how Chaldea 's fatal day came , how the Tigris deserted its ancient and respectable bed and in changing its course cut a new channel , gnawed away the feeder canal and then ate away the main Nahrawan itself , devouring the protective works and the attempted repairs faster than they could be completed ; so that one day a moving mountain of water was roaring across the plain , crushing and engulfing all before it . But whatever the cause we may be sure , with Sir William Willcocks , that the rails of the Bagdad Railway will he laid along the banks of a renewed and remodelled Nahrawan canal , for the construction of a railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicable and economically desirable . The plan of this eminent irrigation engineer is , when the international political complications are settled , to begin the construction of the Persian Gulf section of the line at the same time with the restoration of the ancient irrigation system . The plain between the Tigris and the Euphrates is 18,000 square miles in extent ; the area between the Euphrates and Arabia is 9,000 square miles ; the delta of the Tigris and the Euphrates covers 5,000,000 acres . Here is the means of creating crops that would develop the commercial basis of the railroad . In the region which is described as Upper Chaldea and which includes the Tigris districts around Bagdad it is estimated that 1,300,000 acres could be brought under cultivation at a cost of $10,000,000 , and with a value of $95,000,00 ; in Lower Chaldea 1,500,000 acres at a cost of $17,000,000 , and with a value of $55,000,000 ; or a total of 2,800,000 acres reclaimed at a cost of $27,000,000 and an addition of $150,000,000 to the wealth of the region. * Another estimate by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reclaimed by an outlay of $40,000,000 on canals and repairs , and the raising of lands whose value is now zero to $150 per acre . Skeptics smile at dreams of what may be done and at the estimates of costs and values ; but though the dreams may not always come true in the dreamer 's lifetime it is well not rashly to ridicule the grand projects of men whose record of achievement already is written . The West of the New World is linked with these projects not only in sympathy , but in the lessons of experience . Suggestions for the swamp lands of the Euphrates are drawn from the Mississippi ; the winning of the alkali plains of the southwest offers precedents for the sandy clays between Bagdad and Babylon . There is also the wider field for the application of the new force of electricity in old lands , because the general plan of reclaiming the swamp regions is to operate small pumps on the banks of the main drain by electricity distributed from one central station .  | The Turkish Government with the assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice lands of the ancient Babylon and in other ways preserving and improving the existing Euphrates canals . These plans have been extended also to some of the Tigris districts , but the general scheme for restoring the old works of Mesopotamia is yet to be inaugurated . When we consider that the population of the regions adjacent to the Tigris is only one-fourth of what it was in the ninth century , it does not seem beyond the power of the engineers to bring it from the 1,500,000 of the present day up to the 6,000,000 of Haroun-al-Raschid 's time , just as the Egyptian population has been brought to equal that of the period of the Roman conquest and the Arab occupation of the Nile valley . This brings us to the Bagdad Railway and the relation of its construction to river and canal engineering , and to European politics and the international aspect of the project . Before the railway can be completed many questions affecting Turkey 's relation to world politics are to be settled and , in the meantime , the prolongations from Koniah which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the local traffic which they develop . No illusions exist about immediate prospects when it is recalled that the original concession was granted in 1899 , that $87,000,000 was estimated as the capital necessary for the construction of the line , and that it was to be completed to Bagdad in eight years . It is one of the misfortunes of the Ottoman Empire that the cross purposes of the European nations , which insure its political and territorial integrity because of their inability to agree on the division of the spoils that would follow partition , interfere with railway building and other material development . When the original concession was given to the German capitalists , an alarmist body of English public opinion wanted the construction to be " forbidden " by the British lion , and Mr. Balfour was sharply criticised for his statement in Parliament that it was an enterprise in which the German Government was not concerned and that sooner or later this great undertaking would be embarked on . One faction was divided between satisfaction over a railway which would be a strategic defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French financial interests in Constantinople to join with the German banks in financing the undertaking . A third view was that of those who saw no commercial basis for what they looked upon as a permanently unprofitable enterprise , and were willing that the Turkish Government and the German and French capitalists should sink as much money as suited them . Since that time there have been changes in European politics ? a British n jproc/u'mcnt with France and Russia ? and to Germany alone is left the task of financing the project with such help as can be afforded by the Porte . No European nation or combination of nations may keep Germany from reaching the Tigris , because the route thither is through undisputed Turkish territory and the Sultan 's irade in granting the concession must be respected . But Bagdad is well up the river , navigable only for small boats and rafts . Basoorah is 500 miles farther down and is nearer the mouth of the Tigris and the Euphrates at the Persian Gulf . Yet it is not the proper place for a terminus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far as there is political overlordship of the Persian Gulf , England claims it and affirms the Asiatic Monroe Doctrine , enunciated by Lord Lansdowne for guarding the approaches to the Indian Empire . The Persian Gulf ports are only four or five days fast steaming from Karachi and Bombay . As early as 183o the English , in seeking a shorter route to bndia , discussed not only Suez but also the Euphrates which was surveyed as the future " way to India . " The firman which was at that time secured from the Sultan , gave English companies rights of navigation on the Euphrates and the Tigris , and was regarded as part of a general scheme of overland communication , instead of being merely the local navigation which it has remained for three-quarters of a century . Undoubtedly the Bagdad Railway , if not a rival of the Suez Canal , would be a parallel route and competitive at least to the point of taking care of the freight traffic which , in spite of constant enlargement and improvements , Suez , through the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mails through Suez  | were expedited there would still be passenger travel overland to the Persian Gulf . The German engineers calculated the time between Constantinople and Bagdad at . fty-five hours , with another twenty-four hours to Basoorah . Two plans have been proposed for overcoming the obstacles to the construction of the Bagdad line and for securing the financial resources . One is by neutralizing and internationalizing it as advocated by Englishmen and Frenchmen . Berlin to Bagdad is no more alliterative than Bagdad to the Bosphorus , yet the former term evokes the goblin of German influence . Germany might consent to internationalization and the aid of English and French capital , with the full assurance that she would yet receive the greatest benefit from the enterprise . German colonies are certain to spread through Asia Minor and German farmers will garner the wheatfields of Mesopotamia , whether their own nation or a combination of nations construct the railway line . The alternative plan I first heard in India , and it was reinforced in Constantinople by arguments of more or less weight . This was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . Knowing the rich field which the capital of the United States has found for exploitation at home and the indifference and timidity with which it views foreign ventures , this suggestion does not impress an American strongly . But the Anglo-Indian and the cosmopolite of Constantinople , the one with the clearer perspective which comes from proximity and the other with the closer knowledge of European-Asiatic politics which is acquired by life in that atmosphere of cross purposeful diplomacy , have a line of reasoning . They hold that the restless energy of the American industrial capitalist can not be curbed and that when his field is no longer capable of extension at home he will seek big projects abroad . Then they reason that internationally every difficulty would vanish if the citizens of a country which has no possible territorial ambitions in Europe or Western Asia were to enter upon the undertaking which each strong European nation dreads to see accomplished by some other Power . Those who hold this view maintain that the transfer of rights already acquired would be easily arranged if the construction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German , English and French capital would willingly cooperate with the United States should the latter take the lead in this plan of international financing . The suggestion of Western influence , so pronounced as that of the New World restoring the ancient prosperity of the old East that lies between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf , whether carried out or not , reflects the spirit of the age . But why should it not have a part in transforming the desert caravan , changing the camels for railway engines , just as it has changed the mule-pack trains of its own West ? In considering the changes from the caravan to the locomotive as exemplified in the Bagdad Railway and the Damascus-Mecca Line the results have been viewed solely with reference to Islam , for Asiatic Turkey is entirely Moslem . But other changes are taking place or are in prospect which bring together sections that are not within any one sphere , either Moslem or Christian . The Khedive of Egypt has been credited with a fanciful ambition in his plans for extending the present system of Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line would be commercially valuable after it left the delta area which is capable of reclamation and began to link up the oases , can not be determined on speculative grounds . At the time of the Roman conquest the population on this northern fringe of the Sahara was considerably in excess of what it now is and there was a flourishing nomad civilization . The Sultan of Turkey hardly could fail to encourage a project which brought his subjects in the Barbary States , who question neither his political nor his spiritual sovereignty , in closer contact with his adherents in Egypt . The Alexandria and Tripoli line most likely would be regarded by Great Britain as an encouragement to the dreaded Pan Islam agitation , and back of the scheme is the shadow of a new Morocco question , so it may reasonably be anticipated that the English overlordship in Egypt will be exerted in a manner to keep the Khedive 's project from becoming too definite . Yet it has the Western spirit , for it is voiced by the nationalistic movement of young Egypt whose political ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of the Cape-toCairo Line , both on its sentimental and its practical side , and the interrelation of the African railroads , were discussed with comprehensive clearness by Major Girouard in SCRIBNER 'S MAGAZINE for May , 1906 . Since the publication of that article the Berber Soudan Line to the Red Sea has been completed and Khartoum is now accessible either up the Nile and across the desert from Wadi Halfa or by the shorter route from Port Soudan across the desert stretch to the river . That the trade of the Soudan ultimately will go and come by the Red Sea is unquestionable , for the commercial movement has begun and the freight train will convey the commodities part of the way along the ancient caravan route . This opening up of the Soudan by means of the railway is one of the most conspicuous instances of Western progress , but its significance is not yet appreciated . Another Red Sea line which , when completed , will supplant the caravans is that which a French company is building from Djibti to Addis Ababa , the capital of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final stops . Menelek , the Emperor of historic Ethiopia , has given many evidences of his enlightenment , and he granted the original concession with the purpose of opening up the vast natural wealth of Abyssinia . Yet it must be with mixed emotions that he watches the progress , slow though it is , of the line . Occupying an impregnable country with a brave and hardy race to maintain its natural defences , he might view with equanimity the benevolently forcible partition of other parts of Africa by European nations . The lesson taught Italy at Adowa he might rightfully conclude would not be without effect . And secure in the mountain strongholds he might also regard with unconcern the lack of an Abyssinian port on the Red Sea which could be easily taken and held by European war vessels . With a railroad leading into the heart of his empire the natural defences are weakened . However , the completion of the French railway under what substantially amounts to its internationalization by France , Great Britain , and Italy , may be looked forward to as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long caravan journey of twenty-two days be reduced to two days of comfortable travelling . It is not , though , the question of passenger travel so much as of frieght traffic that is of consequence in facilitating the development of Abyssinia and the extension of trade to the White Nile for which a railway project also exists . The concession for this proposed line is held by a British subject , and the observance of the compact is included in the treaty arrangement of the three Powers . Offering larger possibilities in the substitution of the railway train for the caravan are the projects for connecting India with Persia . An imaginative German engineer some years ago worked out an elaborate plan for a line from Alexandria , Egypt , to Shanghai , China , covering a distance of 6,400 miles . His proposed route was from Alexandria to Sinai and Akaba , thence to Koweit and Basoorah , through southern Persia to the Baluchistan frontier , to Karachi , across India.and Burma , from Kimlong via Shantung and along the Yangstekiang from Chungking to Shanghai . Shanghai will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Pekin extension , while the Bagdad Line furnishes the means of arriving at Koweit . On that system the crossing place where a change can be made to the Damascus-Mecca Line , will be at Tel Habesch , north of Aleppo , and since it is within the range of probability that railroads will be built from Alexandria to the Sinai Peninsula travellers some day may count on journeying by that means . But the reason for being of the Bagdad Line is to reach the Persian Gulf , while the proposed Indian extension would be considerably to the east of it so that there would still be a gap to cover . The real junction for the railway which , coming from the west , may reach China through Assam and Burma will be at Ruk on the Indus River , a point that disputes with Jacocobad , a little farther on , the claim of being the hottest place in which human existence is possible . It is already the junction for the lines which , coming from Bombay and Calcutta , spread to Karachi on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and centre at Quetta , the capital of British Baluchistan . There is a commercial reason for the extension of the Indian lines from this junction of Ruk , or rather from their present terminus on the frontier of the native Baluchistan ,  | along the caravan route . As in the case of most of the other Indian railways , the Government built the line to Quetta , across the western desert and through the Bolan Pass , which presented formidable engineering difficulties , primarily for military purposes . The enemy might gain predominance in Afghanistan and sweep through the Kyber Pass down to the plains of British India , but once on the plains the country would be far from open to him , for he would be flanked by the British garrisons on account of the facilities for mobilization which the railroad would afford a great army stationed at Quetta . In later years the Anglo-Indian policy adheres to military considerations , but there has been a tendency to look more particularly to the commercial side . Since the Anglo-Russian agreement has been affirmed and spheres of influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persia to England , the old jealousies should disappear . Moscow-Teheran , Moscow-Herat , Moscow-India projects need no longer spoil the sleep of the British Imperialist or keep the British taxpayer awake . The existing Trans-Caspian Railway ceases to be a menace to Great Britain . Khiva is no longer the key to Herat and the danger of theTrans-CaspianLine sere ing a s the base for a spur starting from either Samarkand or Bokhara and extending to Kabul is eliminated . British India is free to utilize the railways which now parallel the Afghanistan frontier , and since the Amir is not likely to depart from his policy of keeping railroads out of Afghanistan until he can maintain an army large enough to control them i the Orient 327 as a means of military defence , the gridironing of this buffer state or even the building of the 450 miles of links which would be necessary in order to join Chaman , the British India railway terminus on the Afghan frontier , with Kushk , the Russian Asiatic terminus is not within present view . Quetta is the real starting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravan route which is known as the QuettaSeistan route . The trade of southern Persia is valuable , geographically it belongs to India , and this region is a natural market for Indian cotton cloths in exchange for dates and other products of Persia . Mohammedan pilgrims also follow it in order to reach Karachi , where they take the steamers for Jeddah on the Red Sea . European competition through the Persian Gulf routes affects Indian trade adversely and the caravan to Seistan makes the traffic very costly . The Indian Government seeks to offset this by giving a rebate on the freight shipped over the railways for Quetta , but government rebates on government railways do not fully meet the situation . The extension of the Bolan Pass and Quetta Line itself is necessary and this is recognized in the current discussion in India of the feasibility of prolonging it along the caravan route to Seistan . If this should be done , and the expected commercial advantages should accrue , it would be some atonement to India for the vast sums that have been spent unnecessarily on military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transformation of transportation in the desert from the camel caravan to the railway locomotive .
