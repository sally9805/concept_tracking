txt VIZCACHERAS are more abundant in generic and specific types than any other existing order of mammals ; and the reason for their abundance and variation may perhaps he sought for in their small size and retiring ways . They skulk , burrow , hide in holes , secrete themselves in leafy retreats , dive under the water , and generally shun observation . Besides the few forms of rodents which will be noticed in the following pages , a good many forms are usually on view in the Zoological Gardens . There are , for instance , commonly to be seen beavers , once , and that within the historic period , a denizen of the British Islands ; squirrels of many kinds , besides the so-called " flying " squirrels with a parachute stretching from arm to leg ; the marmot of the Alps , and that of India ; many rats of diverse kinds ; the South American agouti , and its ally the guinea pig ( really Guiana pig ) ; the hopping jerboa of the East , so like a small kangaroo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little sandy coloured gerbilles and other rat-like creatures . THE VIZCACHA South America , which fosters the muff-producing chinchilla , also is inhabited by the vizcach a or Lagostomus trichodactylus , a smallish rodent of the same family , Chinchillidae . The tail is long and the colour is dark , agreeably diversified by white patches on the cheeks and below . Unlike the chinchilla , the vizcacha dwells on the Pampas , and constructs there burrows in the soil , which are associated in number to form veritable cities , the so-called " vizcacheras . " Like many of the cursorial rodents , the Lagostomus has its toes reduced to four on each front limb , and three on each hind limb . The underground cities which the vizcachas build and inhabit , consist of many burrows which intercommunicate , so that if an enemy enters by one door the vizcacha can bolt by another , like a pickpocket through // those convenient houses modified for his benefit . Like the burrowing marmot of North America miscalled the prairie dog , the vizcacha harbours , apparently not unwillingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of the animal kingdom . A fox is the largest of these boarders , and though he and his vixen devour the young vizcachas , it is apparently regarded merely as " churchyard luck " by the parents , who exhibit no particular symptoms of animosity against vulpes . A weasel also lives almost entirely with the vizcachas , and in his sheer innocence of intent it is hard to believe . Quite harmless are two species of swallow which build their nests upon the sides of the burrows like sand martins at home . Various wasps and beetles complete the list . In North America the rattlesnake and the burrowing owl live with the prairie dog in harmony . In South America the same owl visits the vizcacheras occasionally , and sits outside . This seems to be pure sociability on the owl 's part , for the bird does not apparently make any use of its acquaintance . The chief foes of the vizcachas are the jaguar and the puma ; the domestic dog they do not care about , but baffle his frantic attempts to catch them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moments necessary for the action , dive into their burrow just before his jaws close upon them . Mr. Hudson , who is the chief authority upon the habits of this sociable little rodent , doubts if there is " any other four-footed beast so loquacious or with a dialect so extensive " as is the vizcacha . Being a white-fleshed rodent who does not lead too active a life the meat of the vizcacha is good to eat . PORCUPINES Such terms as " the sharp quilled porpentyne " and the " werely porpapyne , " though bewildering in their I2I DERIVATION OF PORCUPINE spelling , and tending to the concealment of the origin of its name , illustrate the principal external feature of this large rodent . You can not , however , tell the " warlike porcupine " by its quills ; for such thick , solid and sharp hairs , they are nothing else , are common , not only among rodents , but in the insectivora , and even in the spiny anteater of Australia , which is a representative of the most ancient type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be distinguished from an overgrown rat , a magnified representative of the spiny mice ? For one thing , it has spines on its tail , which the spiny mice have not . But to be absolutely certain , recourse must be had to bony and other internal characters . The porcupines are also larger than any other spiny rodent , and there is of course no possibility of confusing them with sharp-nosed and sharp-toothed hedgehog , or Cen/etes . The tail will betray the mouse Show him a mouse 's tail and he will guess With metaphysic swiftness at the mouse and at the Porcupine . The spines have of course given its name to the Porcupine . But it is not certain whether the derivation from " Porc Epic , " i.e. pigspine , is correct , or the more probable " Porte Epic , " i.e. spine bearer . As to the pig alternative , the fondness for calling beasts pigs with a qualification , is universal . The porpoise is the pig fish ; the " Porcus marinus " of the ancients was a beast of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only claim which the porcupine puts forth to this derivation is that , according to the Indian naturalist , Jerdon , the flesh of the porcupine resembles roast pig , with a dash of veal , however , a flavour that seems , according to travellers and gastronomic experimenters , to be the flavour of almost everything new to the palate . The spines enter largely into the genuine natural history of the porcupine , as well as into legend . They are plainly I22 THE PORCUPINE IN HERALDRY a protective armature , and it will be noticed at the Zoo that , if a porcupine is alarmed or threatened , it instinctively bristles out its spines and turns its back upon the quarter whence threatens the supposed aggression . Yet it is clear that these fixed bayonets are not inexpugnable . For we are told that the tiger will make a meal of a porcupine . As to legend , there is of course the story that the porcupine shoots its quills . This legend is utilised in the coat of arms of the French king , Louis XII. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et eminus , " i.e. prepared for enemies close at hand and at a distance . There is a pig-like suggestion too in the legend that the porcupine is especially infuriated by , and will savagely attack , venomous serpents ; for it is well known that a pig will encounter , trample to death , and munch up the fierce Fer de Lance of the West Indies . The porcupine is alleged to roll upon the snake and transfix it with its spines , just as the purely insect-eating hedgehog of this country is alleged to roll over fallen apples in the orchard and bear them off to its lair . If the common porcupine of Asia , Africa , and even of certain parts of Southern Europe , be watched , the origin of the legend concerning the shooting off of its spines will be clear to the onlooker . It has the habit when annoyed of rustling its spines , and in the effort of rustling some of the spines will fall to the ground , or even be shaken to a little distance away . To such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a remarkable fact that the porcupines of north and South America are arboreal , and that those of South America , which have a long tail , have that tail prehensile . There is thus an exact parallel between the monkey of the two hemispheres and the porcupines of the Old and New Worlds . Of the Canadian Urson and of the South American tree porcupines ( Synetheres or Coendou ) , at any rate , of the latter , there are often , if // not usually , specimens at the Zoo . It is a curious fact that a peculiar long-tailed porcupine of the Old World has such a habit of ridding itself of that tail by misadventure , that the original specimen was ineptly called Trichys lipura . THE LEMMING There are several kinds of lemmings , at fewest two , which are circumpolar in range , and are found in the extreme of North America and Greenland , in Siberia and the north of Europe . They are little rodents , especially closely allied to the real water-rat , or vole , and belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which embraces anything and everything that can be really termed a rat . The most familiar kind of lemming is the little animal which lives in the central highlands of Norway , and whose migrations are referred to in every book on popular zoology . It has been an inmate of the Zoo , though at the moment of writing there are no examples of it . So associated is this little beast with its restless and persevering habits , that but a trifle is known about it when really at home in central Norway . The migrations seem to be associated with hunger ; unusual fertility produced lemmings in excess of available food . It is exactly the same thing that occasionally occurs with other rodents , more particularly with the field vole , of which there were phenomenal swarms in Scotland a few years back . When this event occurs , which is at quite irregular intervals , the lemmings put their best foot forward and set forth on their journey . So suddenly , and in such hordes , do they appear , that in old days they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many persons believe with regard to frogs at the present day . They cross streams , descend and ascend cliffs , on their journeyings , and in fact are impeded by no obstacle surmount- // able or apparently insurmountable . This perseverance , however , leads to nothing ; for from these exodus no lemming ever returns . Like the Crusaders of old , they die from various causes on their travels . From falling into water , from fights with one another , and a vast quantity of them fall a prey to wolves and gluttons , buzzards and ravens , who haunt their route and take abundant toll of the migrants . Occasionally during a lemming year a fever arises along the route among the human inhabitants , which is called lemming fever . This is due to the numerous putrefying corpses left along the way , and is a testimony to their multitudes . The rapidity with which lemmings multiply is well put by Dr. Brehm , who says , " All the young of the first litter of the various lemming females thrive , and six weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents have brought forth a second and a third litter , and these in their turn bring forth young . " In past times lemmings lived in this country , and the interesting observation has been lately made of quite fresh-looking skeletons , with skins attached , in Portugal . It seems possible that lemmings still lurk among the fastnesses of the Iberian peninsula . THE CAPYBARA Apart from the mysterious , and until this year almost fabulous Dinomys , of which the first and only example known until lately was met with casually wandering round the courtyard of a house in a remote Peruvian town , without visible means of subsistence or ascertainable residence , the capybara , or carpincho , is the largest existing rodent . There was once upon a time ? literally " when pigs were swine , " for the Sui e were of a generalized type , and could be better called swine than pig , which denotes the Chinese domestic variety ? a rodent I25 AN AQUATIC RODENT obviously termed Megamys , with a body as big as an ox . The capybara is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rodent whose nearest living allies are the Patagonian cavy , which looks like a weird long-legged hare , and of which there are always examples in the Gardens , and of the restless cavy , better known , when domesticated , as the Guinea pig . It might be thought that the name of the latter forbade any close alliance with the American carpincho . But Guinea in this case is merely a corruption of Guiana . All the members of this family of rodents are in fact limited to the southern half of the American continent . The capybara , whose scientific name is Hydrochoerus capybara , which of course ? the generic name that is ? signifies water hog , is much addicted to water , and has distinct points of likeness to the ungulates generally , if not to the pigs in particular . The skin is thick , and rather sparsely haired , with coarse hairs as compared to such a rodent as the squirrel , or even its ally , the Guiana pig . The toes are reduced in number , which is , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are approaching towards hoofs in character ; and finally the last molar tooth is of great length , as in the wart hog and , indeed , the elephant . Being largely aquatic it is not surprising to find that the hind toes are to some extent webbed . These creatures are sociable and frequent banks of rivers , whence they constantly plunge into the water , in which element they are adept swimmers . They delight in wallowing in mud like other thickskinned beasts . Their gait is a clumsy gallop , and is compared by Mr. Aplin with that of the Guiana pig . The step of the carpincho in fact betrays the cavian . The blundering way in which these heavy rodents charge when disturbed is a source of terror to horses , who will not face them . They are literally thick skinned ; but in recompense they have the most complicated and furrowed brain of all rodents . I26 ALLIES OF THE HEDGEHOG ORDER INSECTIVORA Some of the characters of this archaic group have been already referred to under the carnivora . Others will be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodging-house for weird and ancient beasts who have found sanctuary in its impenetrable forests , unfrequented by many carnivorous animals , and have thus escaped the extinction which their relatives have suffered elsewhere . Thus it is in Madagascar that the vast majority of the lemurs , those archaic forerunners of the monkey tribe , are to be found . The more modern types , such as the monkeys themselves , and the bears and antelopes and feline carnivora , have never , as it appears , even gained access to Madagascar , which was cut off , it is believed , from the African continent some ages since . Among the peculiar beasts of that great island is the hedgehog-like Centetes , which belongs to the insectivora , a group which represents , as it would seem , an archaic state of affairs . Like the rodents , the insectivores have habituated themselves to almost every kind of life ; they burrow like the moles , swim like certain shrews , and the West African " otter " Potamogale , even fly , when we remember that the Colugo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group ; they especially favour a lurking existence , slinking in the underwood , and dwelling in holes ; in fact they do everything except lead an open and ravening life . It is perhaps for these reasons , coupled with their small size , that the insectivora , as a group , have persisted , and are indeed so numerous in their varied kinds . Centetes is not by any means unlike a hedgehog in general aspect . It is a small brownish creature with a long snout , and with hairs which are stiff and yet are called hairs . A different name will be given by any one // who handles the Centetes incautiously . It is really not far inferior to the hedgehog in spininess . In young stages it has definite bands of long spines down the body . Spines of course are a common feature of the whole race of insectivorous animals . They have , too , sharp teeth and well-developed canines . The bite of Centetes is a serious matter . It feeds upon earthworms chiefly . The Tendrec , Tanrec or Tenrec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most prolific of mammals . It is said to produce twenty-one young at a birth . It has no tail and a very small brain , so small , indeed , that it is no larger in comparison to the skull than the extremely minute brains of certain extinct animals of the dim past belonging to quite other groups , and whose disappearance is perhaps partly to be explained by their lack of cunning . Measured by this standard the Tenrec is not long for this world . Few insectivores are to be seen at the Zoo . They do not readily lend themselves to captivity . It is clear that moles and shrews are not suitable exhibits . The Tupaia , however , a Malayan insectivora that seems to mimic a squirrel , is one of the few types that has been at the Zoo . ORDER EDENTATA This is a heterogeneous assemblage of peculiarly weirdlooking beasts of doubtful relations to other mammals , and indeed to each other . Though it is plain enough from anatomical considerations , and from the analysis of extinct forms , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closely related assemblage , it is not at all plain that these have any relation whatever to the Manis and the Orycteropus of the Old World , or that the two latter are in any way related to each other . Why then , it may fairly be asked , are all those creatures placed in one order , Edentata . The reasons in truth are of a negative character , and are simply an expression of the // present powerlessness of zoologists to do any better . They fit in nowhere else , and in the meantime the group Edentata may be retained as an assemblage of creatures which admittedly require sorting out when we arc able to do it . THE AMERICAN ANT-EATER One of the most remarkable types of animal life which frequent the gloomy forests of South America is the great ant-bear , Myrmecophaga jubata , the maned anteater as it might be better called , in deference to its Linn2ean name . Claws , tail and tongue , are its most striking attributes , and are most intimately concerned with its mode of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greyish black colour , with a conspicuous stripe over the shoulder , a small head at the end of a longish neck , and with a great bushy tail , which is carried in an arched fashion . Including this tail the ant-bear gets to be as long as seven feet , and the two sexes are of the same build and colour . The claws are so long and stout that the beast has to walk upon the sides of them . Their massive character is in association with the fact that the animal tears open the high ant-hills inhabited by the termites , or white ants of South America , which are often constructed with great solidity . The emerging ants are then licked up by the extraordinarily long and thin tongue , aided by a copious secretion of saliva . In most mammals the salivary glands are limited to the head and throat . But in Myrmecophaga these glands extend right over the breast , and are thus in a position to produce an enormous quantity of the necessary birdlime for the capture of its prey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as toothless as that of the crone . But what it lacks in offensiveness in the mouth it makes up for by its claws , which can rip open any dog in a stroke or two . Their more effective use as an instru- USE OF BUSHY TAIL meat and as a weapon is arrived at by the exaggeration of one of them , the middle claw ; this has grown at the expense of the rest , and has thus been able with the same available material to reach a larger size and strength than if the material were distributed fairly through the hand . It will be just as well not to investigate in the Zoo the nature and uses of these claws . An individual possessed by the idea that the umbrella of commerce was an implement of use in the study of zoological problems , proceeded to roke out an ant-bear . The ant-bear retaliated , and the result was that there was no evidence on the umbrella , but only in the paws of the bear , that it had ever had a silk cover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first scouted as improbable , but is now upheld . During sleep and in stormy weather , Myrmecophaga winds its tail round its head and body in such a way that they must be protected from the weather . This ant-bear is never arboreal . But South America nourishes two allied genera , viz. Tamandua and Cyclothurus , which both live in trees . The former is not unfrequently to be seen at the Zoo . THE SLOTH An exceedingly dependent animal is the sloth . It lives in a continual state of suspense , as Sidney Smith remarked , like a curate distantly related to a bishop . The same reverend and witty author furthermore added that the uses of a sloth hanging from the branches of a Brazilian forest were not obvious ; but that on the other hand it might be fairly asked , " What was the use of a gentleman in Bond Street ? " We need not now ask such a question concerning the sloth ; there are other and more pressing queries . There is no better instance in the whole animal kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly suited to its mode of life . Cut down forests and sloths must inevitably disappear . It is as purely arboreal as the whale is aquatic . But while many partly or wholly arboreal beasts ( for example , the tree kangaroo , described later ) are much like their immediate relatives which live upon the ground , the sloth is so constructed that it differs absolutely from its nearest allies ; its closely approximated and bent claws can only serve as hooks for suspension . Nevertheless , the sloth can progress upon the ground , but only with difficulty and pain . Waterton relates in his Wanderings , that he kept a tame sloth ; but , indeed , the term tame as applied to perhaps the most peaceful even among vegetarian creatures ; seems unnecessary . And upon this sloth he made observations as to its walking powers . The melancholy , and at the same time slightly comic , aspect of the sloth , incited M. de Buffon to the following singular series of remarks in his natural history . The life of the sloth being restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal has retained their impress ; for " all these circumstances announce their wretchedness and call to our mind those imperfect sketches of Nature , which , having scarcely the power of existence , only remained a short time in the world , and were then effaced from the list of beings . " It was further the great French naturalist 's opinion that some animals , like some men , seem to be created only for sadness . De Buff on had to write with a vigilant and aggressive clergy in his mind and was compelled to adopt these somewhat hypocritical sentiments . But in spite of this , which was at the time the orthodox view of the animal creation , the sloth is by no means an animal to be pitied . No creature that is perfectly in accord and harmony with surrounding nature , inanimate as well as animate , can be distressful . The visitor to the Zoo will note at once two distinct features about the sloth ; firstly , its close and shaggy // covering of long and coarse hair secondly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fore limbs in the case of the two-toed sloth , Chola ' pus , and three in Bradypus . It has no fingers to crook to retain its hold upon a branch ; nature has already hooked them for it in a permanent fashion . It can only clutch . The long , wiry hair droops over its body , and forms an excellent shelter against a tropical downpour . As to this hair , it has been pointed out that it fadges well with the sloth 's habits . Instead of lying in different directions in different regions of the body , as is so generally the case with the mammalia , the hair " flows " only downwards ; it can not therefore get wet . But a third danger remains besides the chance of falling , and of getting a soaking . The sloth has tender flesh , and is an appetizing morsel to tree-frequenting beasts of prey ; and South America harbours one of the largest of these , to wit , the jaguar . Defenceless as the sloth is against such attacks , nature has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will very possibly be noticed in examining carefully the hair of the sloth , that this has often a distinctly green colour . Now it was ascertained a good many years ago that this green colour was not in the least due to an actual green colour of the individual hairs , but to the presence within them of minute green plants similar to those which colour so vividly the weather side of trees , to microscopic algae in fact . This gives to the pelage of our sloth a not unstriking likeness to lichens , which is borne out by its bunched-up body , not unlike a tree stump . There is , in fact , in one sloth at least ? there are several species of sloth ? a mark in the middle of the back which suggests a broken end of a branch . Thus we see that the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb , if , indeed , so very shaggy a creature may be used as an illustration of this dictum . // THE ARMADILLO The " little knight in armour " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps about as unlike the " dreaming sloth of pallid hue " of the same continent as any two beasts can well be , that are admittedly both mammals . And yet , while some of the other types ? the Manis and the Orycteropus which are by some placed in the same order , that of Edentates , are really unlike the armadillo , there are numerous facts in the structure of the sloth which show it to be akin . In no other part of the world than in America are there , or have there been ever , so far as our knowledge enables us to state , animals belonging to these three types , the sloths , armadillos and anteaters . The unique structural peculiarity which they share is that the vertebrae of the back are fastened together successively by joints additional to those which exist in other mammals . It is curious that the opinion of the zoologist is reinforced by that of a practical hunter , who thought of a rare kind of armadillo , remarkable for possessing its bony skin plates only along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an hybrid between the armadillo and the ant-bear . Fundamentally related though the armadillo and the Myrmecophaga are , they are obviously most diverse in external form and feature . The immovable stolidity of the sloth and its comical face , the stately gait of the ant-eater and its huge bushy tail , contrast with the cheerful pattering waddle of the armadillo , sheathed in its thick armour . The armadillo ? or , rather , the armadillos , for there are at least six distinct genera , many of which contain several species ? has the unique peculiarity among mammals both living and extinct ( with the single exception of certain armoured whales of great antiquity ) of possessing a defensive armature composed of bony plates imbedded in the skin . But these bony plates do not make it a tortoise any more than the scales of the Manis make it a // lizard . They clash with a vast series of important facts which differentiate mammals from animals lying lower in the series , which have been already enumerated , and , quite apart from the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoise or turtle , no more affine the two than does the beak of the tortoise , or the Ornithorhynchus , bridge over the gulf between those creatures and the bird . The huge , and we may almost say , " therefore , " extinct , Glyptodons , which were allies of the armadillos , were boxed up in their carapaces ; the modern armadillos enjoy a freedom of movement within theirs , since the bony pieces are often distributed in bands . A species often to be seen at the Zoo , and known as Tolypcutcs h'icinctus , has its chest protected , as ought his to be who first crosses the seas , by a triple band , not of brass , but of bone . In others again there are six bands ; and the tiny Chlamydophorus ( which will probably not be seen at the Zoo ) has a point of likeness to the effete Glyptodonts , in having a rigid box enveloping it without jointing . So thoroughly movable are these bands as a rule , that the armadillo can roll up into a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with impunity played at ball with by a hungry jaguar , intent rather on solid food than playful trifling . Nor could the jaguar easily solve the difficulty by swallowing the armadillo like a pill . In its own choice of food the armadillo is decidedly a carrion lover , and approaches its food after the devious fashion of a burying beetle . Instead of openly making for the carcass , the armadillo circuitously tunnels underground and comes up underneath it . We are told that on the pampas a carcass is rarely found that has not beneath it a tunnel formed by some epicurean armadillo intent on luxury . At the Zoo this taste is severely restricted , and a diet of pap and chopped meat offered in its place . Mr. Hudson relates another way the armadillo has of providing itself // with meat . It will attack , and literally saw in two with the sharp edges of its carapace , a living snake . THE PANGOLIN The pangolin is a corruption of the Malay word , Tagiling , " which is the vernacular name for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to us in general , as the scaly ant-cater . The genus Manis , of which there arc some seven species , inhabits both Asia and Africa . It looks , as it has been well expressed , " like an animated spruce fir cone . " The scales in fact with which it is thickly beset are brown and withered-looking , and loosely attached at the base in quite a vegetable fashion . They suggest that a good shake will scatter them . Nevertheless , the scales are very firm , and offer a double protection to their possessor . When harried and worried by a dog or other carnivore searching a meal , the scaly ant-eater rolls itself up into something like a ball , and presents a hard smooth surface to the enemy . Should the latter attempt a nearer investigation of the Manis , the scales contract still closer to the body , and often carry with them a fragment of flesh from the aggressor 's nose , pinched off by their sharp edges . In two parts of the world , namely in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legend has spread from the one place to the other the Manis is believed to make another use of its scales . It erects them and then pretends to be dead . The inquisitive ant , in the fashion which everybody knows , wanders in multitudes over the body , and creeps between the scales . When a sufficient number of ants have thus begun to investigate the Manis , the latter closes his scales , and entering the nearest piece of water again erects his scales , and laps up the ants as they float out . The food of this , // animal is entirely ants ; like the American ant-eaters , but unlike the African Oryctero jars , the Manis has no teeth in its mouth , though the tongue is long and helped by large salivary glands . Like the American ant-cater , the Manis has a stomach which may be almost compared to a bird 's gizzard . That is its walls are much thickened with muscle , and small pebbles seem to be also swallowed to help in crushing the food which in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any hag the Manis triumphs over nature by adventitious help . It is said , however , to be a particularly stupid animal . When kept in confinement it wanders on at night in a straight line , like a Roman making a road , and if a chair happens to be in the way , climbs over it and falls down on the other side . All these ant-eaters are not purely ground-living creatures , like the aard vark . Many arc , it is true ; and burrow therein to a very great length and depth . An Indian species makes a tunnel shelving downwards of twelve feet in length , and terminates it with a comfortable chamber of six feet circumference , to rest in . Some pangolins , however , climb ; and in these the toes are turned inwards and downwards as they are in the great American ant-eater . The largest Manis is six feet long ; and one species , which obviously had to be called Manis macruva , has the distinction of being one of not more than three animals which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly twice as long as the body . The same doubt surrounds the origin of the Manis as does that of the aard vark . Its birth is " wrop up in a mistry . " And here again no fossils can be appealed to , to help us out of the impasse . The brain is not so helpful as it appears to be in the aardvark . There are , however , rather more grounds in this case than in that for linking on the Manis to the American ant-eaters , though , as already said , they are at present not entirely trustworthy . // THE AARD VARK A sight of this undoubtedly one of the strangest of the mammalia will convince the observer of the justice of the Dutch name for it , viz. the " earth hog . " It is also distinctly like the figure of the Devil in Albert Durer 's picture of Sintram . The piggish appearance is mainly due to the soft snout broadened and flattened at the end with the nostrils on the flattened region . The long ears , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to the likeness , and contribute towards the building up of a beast that , if it were figured as a " restoration " of some extinct form , would cause jeers at the expense of the draughtsman . Nature in fact in constructing the aard vark seems at first sight to have blundered . That will not be the view of anyone who has had the opportunity of watching the aard yard on its native Karoo . It buries itself in the earth with such rapidity , that it can only be followed by digging ahead in the presumed direction in which it is going . The Orycteropus is an underground creature living in burrows of its own excavation , which are thoughtfully and conveniently placed in the neighbourhood of the tall hills erected by the white ants upon which this ant-eater of the Cape preys . The body is eminently suited for burrowing for it dwindles at the two ends ; the tail is but little distinct from the body , and has been correctly described as " a tapering of the body to a point . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African and burrowing creature , the little rodent Heterocephalus . It appears that for burrowing animals the two extremes of hairiness are the most suitable . At one extreme we have Heterocephalus and the armadillos , and at the other the mole ; but in the latter beast the fur is so dense and close that it presents an even surface comparable to nakedness . The reason for the extreme // is thus seen . Orycteropuus feeds upon ants and it is said to impatiently thump with its heavy tail before commencing operations upon an ant hill ; this throws the small inhabitants into such a panic that they run hither and thither in their confusion and pour out into the jaws of their foe . As it feeds on ants it is not surprising to find that Orycteropus has a particularly long and viscid tongue like the tongue of other formicivorous creatures . It is surprising , however , to find in its mouth , besides a long tongue , an extensive range of teeth . Other ant-eating creatures , for instance the anteater , have no teeth . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not an inheritance from the not very remote days when the Orycteropus , so to speak , chewed the cud like an ox . The mystery of its origin is one upon which but little light has been thrown .. While the discovery of numerous fossil links bind together other groups of mammals , no such connexions are forthcoming in the case of our aard vark . It is an isolated and friendless type declining to be allied even to its neighbour , the Mantis or pangolin . The old idea that it came near to the ant-eater of America has long since been exploded . Probably it is not an exaggeration to say that no two mammals are further apart than these two . The only hints that we seem able to get are in the brain . The nervous system generally among animals is an exceedingly conservative system , changing but slightly with other changes , and then showing up unexpected likenesses in beasts apparently remote . It has been pointed out that the brain of the Orycteropus is singularly like that of an ungulate animal ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likeness . In the meantime there are at least two distinct species of aard vark found in Africa , a northern and a southern form , while in former times , as shown by its fossil // remains , the Orycteropus was an inhabitant of the land of Samos and the kingdom of Persia . ORDER MARSUPIALS , OR KANGAROOS , WOMBATS AND THE LIKE The name marsupial indicates the most salient external feature of this order of mammals , viz. the possession of a pouch . Constantly it will be possible to observe this pouch in the case of kangaroos which happen to have young ones ; for the infant kangaroo can be seen peering out of the maternal pouch . The reason for this pouch , or at any rate a fact which accompanies the possession of this pouch , is the very imperfect condition of the newborn young ; they are tiny blind and naked creatures , not longer than the little finger . To the eye of the visitor this pouch is about the only visible character which links together the marsupial tribe . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thicktailed , leaping kangaroos with their long ears , and donkey-like face , are extraordinarily different from . the fat marmot-like wombat , or from the comparatively recently discovered marsupial mole , the golden coloured , burrowing Notoryctes . The fierce Tasmanian wolf , Tasmanian devil , and ursine Dasyure , represent another type of this most diverse order , carnivorous in habit and with a smaller pouch backwardly directed instead of forwardly as in the kangaroos . The Phalangers of Australia and the Koala or " native bear " are softfurred arboreal marsupials , quite as different in external appearance from any of the types that have been mentioned , as are the latter among themselves . The American opossums are different again ; and another extreme of this curiously diverse order is realized by the tiny " flying " forms which skim from branch to branch like the flying squirrels of the order Rodentia. // All these marsupials possess also a pair of bones diverging from each other like a " V " , which support the walls of the pouch , and are not found in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the skin ; and though it has been said that the dog possesses a similar pair of structures , it is not by any means clear that there is a real correspondence . It will be noticed that these bones , although they support the wall of the pouch , are not in the least developed to that end ; for they occur in the male as well as in the female . With the exception of the American opossums and a small creature known as " Raton runcho , " or technically as Canolestes , the marsupials are at the present day only found in Australia and some of the islands to the north of that continent as well as in Tasmania in the south . They do not get to New Zealand , which is an island without indigenous mammals at all except a bat or two . THE GIANT KANGAROO One of the principal improvements at the Zoo of late years has been the formation of a respectable paddock for the enjoyment of the leaping kangaroos , who can now show us something of their strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they vegetated gave no chance to realize that a kangaroo can clear at a single leap a space of some twenty feet . The kangaroo is certainly like no other animal , except , of course , its own immediate relatives the other kangaroo-like genera . Its rather small head with long ears is not unsuggestive of that of a donkey ; it has a mild look which is not an index of its nature , for the kangaroo when at close quarters and with its back against a wall is not by any means a mild antagonist . The body with its huge tail , powerful hind legs , and diminutive fore limbs is only paralleled by the jerboa // and the jerboa-rats of Australia , and by the Cape jumping hare ( Pedetes eager ) of Africa . To be agile , to traverse arid wastes in the search for water or for herbage , with rapidity , is a sine qud non with all these creatures which have a partiality for plains , and arid ones at that . It is interesting and most instructive to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the due carrying of their owners over the ground . In the ungulates either the middle toe or the third and fourth has or have been especially strengthened to meet the demand . In the jerboa the Perissodactyle type of foot has been , we must suppose , quite independently acquired ; for in them digit number three is in the middle and strikes the ground first . In the kangaroos , on the other hand , it is the fourth toe which is predominant ; and it is , as may be easily seen in the living animal , particularly strong and furnished with a huge nail . In bipedal man it is the innermost toe , the first , which mainly bears the weight of the body . There is thus nearly every possible arrangement , which varies according to the group . In the kangaroo the peculiarly tiny third and fourth toes will be noticed to be tied up in a common integument . How thick blood is among the marsupials is shown by the fact that in the phalangers , arboreal creatures quite unlike the kangaroos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in skin . There are between twenty and thirty kinds of kangaroos , including the so called wallabies which are not now distinguished from the kangaroos ; the only difference that ever existed was merely one of size . THE TREE KANGAROO The idea of a kangaroo up a tree suggests a purely metaphorical use of the term to most persons for whom 1 // kangaroos are essentially ground-hopping creatures . Nevertheless there is a whole genus of kangaroos known by the technical name of Dendrolagus , which name , it will be observed , expresses the fact of their arboreal proclivities , whose life is spent hopping along branches and not bounding over the grass . There are about three different species of these tree kangaroos , of which a new one has been lately found and named after the traveller Lumholz . The build of the kangaroo does not seem at first sight to be suitable to nice balancing and clambering upon branches . Yet it is highly interesting to notice how , with the minimum expenditure of energy in the way of alteration , Nature has been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as distinctively arboreal . The long tail remains ; but it is furry throughout and of somewhat more slender dimensions ; it is no longer wanted as a prop for the animal when progressing slowly along the ground . It rather serves the Dendrolagus as a balancing pole to aid in its successful leaps from branch to branch . And for this purpose it need not be quite so massive and so comparatively short-haired as in kangaroos and wallabies . The toes also , which have greatly prolonged nails in the leaping kangaroo , have these nails much shorter in the tree-frequenting beast . The fore limbs , too , are rather longer in proportion than those of kangaroos ; otherwise there is but little change in habit . Dendrolagus has the mild somewhat asinine features of kangaroos , the same two projecting under incisors like French caricatures of the English " Mees , " which it is to be presumed can work upon each other like the blades of a pair of scissors ; they can at any rate in the common kangaroo , a fact which was shown a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of far reaching importance either externally or internally , that differentiates this creature from other kangaroos. // WOMBATS The Zoological Gardens are rarely , if ever , without these fat somewhat uncouth marsupials , suggestive of an overgrown marmot . They are coarsely hairy , and waddle when unexcited , though when needs must they can run with some rapidity . The stumpy tail heightens the likeness to the European marmot , as do also the strong and rodent-like incisor teeth in the front of the jaws . In fact , as has been often pointed out , the wombat is an excellent example of what is known as convergence ; starting from a totally different place in the order of nature it has arrived at much the same goal as has the marmot or some such burrowing rodent . It walks heavily on the flat of the feet , and cats roots for which it digs . In the burrows there is some degree of sociability exhibited ; and this again is a rodentlike character . One has only to recall the prairie marmots , and the vizcachas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pouch of the ordinary marsupial pattern ; and its young are doubtless born in imperfection as those of other marsupials , though that matter is for the present shrouded in some obscurity . Although nocturnal in their native Australia and Tasmania , the wombats at the Zoo show themselves during the day like other nocturnal beasts do in that institution . Like many other marsupials , the " pouched mouse , " to translate its scientific name of Phascolomys is for the most part silent ; it is not without interest that silence is apt to be an attribute of primitiveness and chatter due to higher specialization . We all of us know the silent man whose few recorded words were not indicative of great brain power . Anyhow newts are silent and so are reptiles and many of the older types of birds , while the marsupials and rodents and insectivores carry on the generalization into the mammals . At times , however , the wombat hisses ; one species is said to // give vent to a " groan . " In captivity it is as a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Everard Home , however , the famous surgeon and anatomist of the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries , thought the wombat not unintelligent though he agreed from personal observation as to its amiability . THE VULPINE PHALANGER The vulpine phalanges is not especially fox-like in aspect though it has somewhat of the sharp-snouted eagerness of that animal , toned down , however , by marsupial stupidity . Trichosuyus vulpecula ( between this name and Phalangista vulpina choice may be made ) has departed considerably from , or rather has not nearly arrived at , the kangaroo type of structure . Still there arc numerous facts which show it to be allied to the kangaroos . For instance the second and third toes are bound together in a common integument as in the leaping and long-tailed Diprotodont ; and it has the same strong lower incisors which , however , it is alleged , do not meet and move upon each other in the scissors-like way that has been recorded in the grazing kangaroos . Trichosurus , in fact , is purely arboreal , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions it walks in a flat-footed and archaic way . It is , however , most suited to a life in trees , and it has as an aid to effective climbing , a prehensile tail , so common a feature in tree-dwelling animals . It chiefly affects the blue gum tree of its native Australia and eats the leaves and shoots of that tree , occasionally varying its diet , as is the way with many vegetablefeeding animals marsupial and otherwise , with animal food . In captivity small birds are enjoyed by it . It is often called " opossum , " but it has of course nothing to do with the opossums of North and South America , // save the bare fact that it is , like them , a marsupial . The real and genuine opossums belong to the carnivorous section of the marsupials , the Polyprotodonts . They are , however , tree climbers and have the same prehensile tail and sharp claws which distinguish our Trichosurus . The pouch of Trichosurus only harbours at most two young ones and more usually one only . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' possum . " In Australia and Tasmania it is hotly pursued on account of its moderately valuable fur . This is its attraction to the white man . The black man thinks less of the fur than of the flesh beneath it , and regards Trichosurus , in spite of its rankness in the European nostril , as desirable meat . BELIDEUS BREVICEPS We must not leave the diprotodont marsupials without a reference to the flying forms of which the present representative ( also called Petaurus breviceps ) is often to be found at the Zoo . It is a small , soft-furred , mousy-looking creature of grey colour with a black stripe down the back . It is not more than eight inches long and has a bushy tail of about the same length . The term " flying " as applied to these phalangers must not of course be taken literally . They can not soar upward like a bird ; the most that can be done is a series of skims from bough to bough , the distance to the ground being lessened at each effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a parachute-like membrane attached along the sides of the body between the limbs . It seems to be likely that all kinds of flying really originated from some such mechanism , which gradually became restricted to the fore-limbs in the more perfectly flying birds and bats . A loose fold of skin at the sides is sufficient for a beginning ; this becomes intensified , and then the " patagium " in birds is limited to the Z.G. 145 L POLYPROTODONTS front of the fore limbs , a trace of the primitive lateral membrane being left in what is called in those animals the metapatagium . There is a kind of a hint that in the earliest known bird , Archo ptcryx , a lateral feathered membrane existed besides the special patagium with its feathers in front of the fore limb . A remarkable fact about these small flying phalangers is that the power of flight appears to have been independently produced more than once in the group . For we find several types of them each of which is separately related to a non-flying form ; we suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same conclusion can be come to with regard to the flying squirrels , real squirrels that is to say , for the marsupials which we are now considering are sometimes termed flying squirrels In Scinropterus and Anomcalurus , of which the former is often to be seen at the Zoo , we have parachuted squirrels not nearly akin to each other , and therefore possibly to be derived from different forms of merely arboreal squirrels . The carnivorous polyprotodont marsupials have not as yet produced any flying forms . THE TASMANIAN WOLF OR THYLACINE This wolf-like creature is not a wolf but a representative of the polyprotodont section of the marsupials , called polyprotodont because the lower incisors are numerous instead of reduced to two as in the vegetablefeeding diprotodonts . The thylacine and its polyprotodont allies show another feature , not found in any other mammals , except the whales , and that is that the total number of the teeth exceed the normal forty-four . This is the original number of teeth , as it appears , in the higher mammals , as testified to by various extinct forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have degenerated . Another feature // about this and of course other marsupials is the existence of a pouch ; but the thylacine is remarkable in the fact that the male has very considerable traces of this pouch , which are not , however , large enough to render it a functional organ for the protection of the newly born young . The name thylacine signifies , of course , pouched clog . The inhabitants of Tasmania call it also tiger and hyaena , these names being suggested by the transverse stripes upon the body . It is more like a dog than anything else ; its head is long with a long muzzle , and the skull at first sight is so like that of Canis that it was frequently used as a " catch " in examinations . The proper marsupial characters are there , but masked by superficial resemblances . The thylacine is now limited to Tasmania , and it has been suggested that the advent of the dingo dog , which accompanied as is thought the Australians in their wanderings , is partly responsible for its disappearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its days will probably not be long in the land where it now abides ; for it has the pernicious habit of sheep stealing and the further habit of killing a new sheep each time that it feels in want of a snack . So the Tasmanian farmers , probably influenced more by economic than zoological considerations , will see to it that the thylacine does not multiply excessively . It has , however , this advantage in battling for life with the colonists , that it apparently can produce four young at a birth . We have spoken of the superficial likeness which the thylacine bears to a dog . This likeness is more apparent in stuffed animals than in the live Tasmanian wolf . The spry alertness of the dog is replaced in life by a gloomy , distrustful , and unintellectual appearance , which is most unsuggestive of any dog . The thylacine has a curious habit which has been lately adverted upon . When standing at ease it plants down // its tail firmly so that it forms a support for the body . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tail . It has been remarked that the thylacine shows a preference for mutton over any other article of diet . Before Van Diemen 's land was discovered there were plenty of thylacines but no mutton . In those days it had to content itself with marsupials only ; an observer , however , has stated that nowadays its palate has been so vitiated by civilization that it will not satisfy a healthy appetite by devouring the wombat , which often occurs in plenty near to its haunts . But on the other hand a spiny ant-eater ( Echidna ) was once dug out of the stomach of a thylacine , showing that when pressed for food it is not particular . The first specimens ever acquired by the Zoological Society came over in the year 185o . They were shipped in company with twelve fat sheep to serve them on the voyage . The next thylacines were procured in 1863 , and then until 1883 there were no specimens of this animal procured for the Zoo . Since that date , however , there have been several ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Gardens this the largest of existing polyprotodont marsupials . It is more likely , however , that several of its allies , such as the dasyure and the American opossums will be on view . ORDER MONOTREMATA , THE ECHIDNA AND THE ORNYTHORYNCHUS In the general sketch of mammalian organization we have dealt with this group , which occupy most certainly the lowest position among the mammalia and still retain more than one early and non-mammalian character in their anatomy . // THE AUSTRALIA ANT-EATER This animal is undoubtedly Australian and is also an eater of ants , and yet the name seems ill chosen , for it suggests a comparison with the ant-eaters of America and of the Old World . Echidna has nothing whatever to do with those Edentates since it belongs to a quite different order whose general characters have been sketched out , Of Echidna aculeata there is as a rule , or at least often , a specimen to be seen at the Zoo . Its general characters mark it out as distinct from any other mammal , from which indeed it can readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and toothless snout recalls the Myrmecophaga and the Old World Manis ; and a long and viscid tongue protrudes itself in the same way from these toothless jaws . But the body is covered with a dense covering of sharp spines , mingled with hairs , in a fashion more like that of the hedgehog than of any other mammal . The ways of the Echidna , when in search of termites , are much those of its ant-eating representatives in other countries . Its stout claws are able to make a breach in the walls of the fortress manned by the ants , and into this breach it thrusts its long tongue and waits until the exploratory and indignant ants have limed themselves thereon . In default of ants the Echidna will put up with worms , and larvae , which it extracts by means of the same long and thin tongue , which can be inserted into crevices and can draw therefrom the lurking insect . Nature has tempered the wind to this exceedingly unshorn lamb by endowing it with a nocturnal way of life , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does not entirely free it from persecution . For in spite of its spines the thylacine , as we have already said , has been known to swallow a spiny ant-eater whole , just as the leopard in India will grapple with the equally spiny porcupine . The // Echidna moves with a shuffling gait and walks badly upon the sides of its feet . This is precisely the way in which the Myrmccophaga walks , and in both cases the habit has at least the result of preserving unimpaired the sharp claws so necessary to dig down the foundations of ant-hills . Everybody knows nowadays that this mammal lays eggs . And furthermore as in other egglaying vertebrates , the young , when ready for hatching , has a knob on its snout which enables it to break the shell and emerge into the world . When it does emerge it is still taken care of by the mother , who keeps it in her pouch for certain time , and afterwards allows its out for a run and at stated intervals picks it up again and puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends to rove far she thinks of her infant and places it securely in a burrow dug for the purpose . It is a very interesting fact that an abundance of termites in various parts of the world has resulted in the medication of such diverse types of animals for their enjoyment . The Echidna was made for the termites , not the termites for the Echidna. 15o BIRDS AND FEATHERS CHAPTER VI Birds THE most uninitiated can recognize without the faintest difficulty the characters that distinguish birds from other animals . But it must not be assumed at once that to define them as feathered bipeds is quite enough . For , to begin with , birds are scaly as well as feathered , thus showing a glimpse , externally visible , of their unquestioned relationship to the lower lying reptiles . The feet are always scaly , in parts at least , and generally entirely so . Anyhow , no creature that is not a bird has feathers or even anything at all approaching to feathers , in nature ; and per contra , no bird is without feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the wrongly called Apteryx , which has tiny wings concealed beneath its feathers . The term wing here , it will be observed , does not necessarily mean an organ of flight . Though all birds possess wings , all birds can not fly . Besides the Apteryx , the ostrich tribe generally are purely cursorial , and so are certain rails and one or two other birds . What is meant by wing in this sense is a fore limb , actually and accurately comparable to the arm of man or the fore legs of a cat , in which the number of fingers is reduced from five to three , and the proportions of the remaining bones is somewhat altered from what is found in reptiles and mammals . This being the case , all birds are bipedal , which is another distinguishing character , though it is // very faintly discounted by the fact of the " quadrupedal " movements of the young of the Hoatzin and a few others . No birds have teeth ; that is , no living birds , for a few now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horny beak , which in some sense stands in lieu of teeth . It is noticeable that birds have an erect and alert attitude , which contrasts with that of the gloomy reptile . The eyes are clear and open , not closed , except , indeed , during actual sleep , in a drowsy fashion . Hearing as well as sight is well developed , and , indeed , the only sense in which birds are as a rule rather deficient is that of smell ; but some experiments have gone far toward showing that after all , birds can detect varying odours rather more accurately than has been supposed . In external form birds are most obviously built upon one common plan . This is recognized in popular parlance by the fact that a given bird is apt to be spoken of merely as a bird , while a mammal is more usually classified roughly ; it is spoken of as a cat , or an elephant , etc . The flight of birds , as well as their lightness of movement when hopping upon the ground or among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is associated with air spaces which ramify among the organs of the body and in the substance of the bones . These air spaces are outgrowths of the lungs ; and while they assist in producing a light frame suitable for flying , must also , one would imagine , improve the respiration of the creatures by bringing air into contact with the entire system . No living reptile or mammal has anything approaching to this aeration of the body . It is possible , however , that certain extinct reptiles , particularly the flying Pterodactyles , had something of the kind ; so too had , in the opinion of most , the hopping and often gigantic Dinosaurs of the past . Associated with , and perhaps due to , this is the hotbloodedness of birds . Their temperature is higher // than that of mammals , and the older authors saw in this physiological likeness a reason for associating together birds and mammals . Every fact of structure , however , contradicts such an association , which is nowadays held by no one acquainted with the facts . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprightly , intelligent bird to the sullen and unintelligent lizard has been perhaps a little overrated . The group of birds , in fact , is a group which is quite equivalent to that of reptiles on the one hand and to mammals on the other ; but the two first arc rather nearer to each other than either are to birds . In fact , the common starting point of both birds and reptiles was , as far as we can see , something in the nature of a very simply organized reptile . To return , however , to our living birds , with which alone we are concerned here . It will be noticed , particularly well in the case of a long-legged bird such as a crane or stork , that when a bird is standing upright it stands upon its toes only . Above the toes , which are either three or four in number , with a few exceptions , such as the ostrich , is a long bone which is not , as might be supposed , the equivalent of our shin bone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus what are technically termed the metatarsals , i.e. those bones which in ourselves lie between the ankle bones proper and the phalanges or bones of the toes themselves . In the human foot the phalanges are the separated toes , while the metatarsals occupy the greater part of the foot . Birds , therefore , have this region of the foot enormously elongated . But the feature is not absolutely distinctive of them , since even in mammals which walk upon their toes , like the horse , the metatarsals are also long . There are other instances of the same elongation of the middle part of the foot . All birds , so far as is known , lay eggs , from which are hatched in due course young birds that resemble their // parents much more closely than do the newly hatched young of the majority of the Amphibia . No bird is ovoviviparous , as are some reptiles . Moreover , as a very general rule the eggs of birds are not merely dropped promiscuously , but laid , sometimes even in a regular position , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some architectual pretensions . The eggs are for the most part coloured , while the eggs of reptiles are never coloured , but always white . A good many birds also lay white eggs . While a reptile emerges from the egg in the likeness of its parents , the young bird does show some differences from its parents , though these are never of a kind such as to justify the use of the term larva for a newly hatched bird . The only suggestion of a larval form among birds is perhaps the Hoatzin , where the mobile fingers with well developed claws at the ends are organs modified for the purposes of the nestling , and thus just come under the category of what is meant by a larva . All these facts , except perhaps the last , are familiar enough to every one ; but it is just as well to emphasize them in order to point out the distinctions between birds and other vertebrated animals . Newly hatched birds differ in different cases . In some species they are completely nude and devoid of feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shed by being thrust up upon the tips of the subsequently produced nestling plumage , which itself gives way later to the final and annually deciduous plumage . The twittering and " cheeping " of the young is succeeded in many birds by a most elaborate voice , produced by the movement of a vibrating membrane at the junction of the two bronchi , into which the at first single air tube ( trachea ) , leading to the lungs , divides . More is said of the bird 's voice later . In the meantime , it is as well to note that the possession of a voice of the kind which reaches its maximum for i // beauty and variety in the nightingale , is a character of birds which is not found in any reptile or indeed in any other vertebrate , in spite of Mr. Ruskin 's singing serpents ! There are more kinds of birds in the world than of any other group of vertebrated animals , very many more . They are the insects among vertebrates by reason of these numbers , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in variety among other vertebrates . In spite of their general uniformity , the " aery caravan " can be divided up into a number of distinct groups , which , however , have by no means the value of the major , or even of the minor , subdivisions of the mammalia or of the reptiles . The range of structural variation among birds is possibly about equal to that of the lizards among reptiles , or of the frogs and toads among Amphibians . We may acknowledge the following groups , to which we shall not apply the term orders , as that would suggest an equivalence with the orders in the mammalia : ( Z ) Passeres , all the small perching birds , such as crows , thrushes , wagtails , birds of paradise , swallows , etc. , etc. ; ( 2 ) Pici , that is , woodpeckers , barbets , and toucans ; ( 3 ) Alcedines , including kingfishers only ; ( 4 ) Colii , - an assemblage of very limited extent , confined to the African mouse birds or colies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ) Coracicae , i.e. rollers , bee-eaters , motmots , todies , puff birds ; ( 7 ) hornbills and hoopoes constitute the group Bucerotes ; ( 8 ) Macrochires , humming-birds and swifts ; ( g ) Caj5rimulgi , goat suckers ; ( to ) Striges , or owls ; ( II ) Psittaci , or parrots ; ( 12 ) Cuculi , cuckoos ( 13 ) Musothagi , touracous ; ( 14 ) Oj5isthocomi , the Hoatzin only ; ( 15 ) Gatti , the gallinaceous birds , pheasants , curassows , turkeys , megapodes , guinea fowls , quails , etc. ; ( 16 ) Colurnbw , pigeons ; ( 17 ) Pterocletes , sand grouse ; ( 18 ) Turnices , the quail-like birds Turnix // and Pedionomus ; ( 19 ) Ralli , rails and coots ; ( 20 ) Otides , bustards ; ( 21 ) Limicolae , snipes , plovers , curlews , etc. ; ( 22 ) Alcae , auks , guillemots ; ( 23 ) Grues , cranes , the New Caledonian kagu , the American cariama , the trumpeters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divers and grebes ; ( 25 ) Sphenisci , penguins ; ( 26 ) Steganopodes , pelicans , cormorants , etc. ; ( 27 ) Herodiones , herons and storks ; ( 28 ) Tubinares , albatross and petrels ; ( 29 ) Palamedeae , screamers ; ( 30 ) Anseres , ducks , geese , and swans ; ( 31 ) Accipitres , eagles , vultures , hawks ; ( 32 ) Tinami , tinamous ; ( 33 ) Struthiones , ostrich tribe . In the following pages will be found accounts of birds belonging to the majority of these groups . THE COW-PEN BIRD The enormous preponderance of Passerine birds over all others is shown by the fact that in the list of animals published by the Zoological Society , no less than 516 species out of a total of 1,676 are members of the Passerine group , which are , or have been , on view in the Society 's menagerie . This being the case , we can not hope to give an adequate idea of their endless variety of colour and , though to a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with saying something about one or two types only . Passerine birds do not run large . The biggest is the raven ; but they are some of them excessively small , though the humming birds seem to include the smallest members of the bird creation , and the humming birds are not Passerine , but members of a distinct group . In the Passerines the organ of voice , or the syrinx , to use Prof. Huxley 's term , reaches its highest complications in the way of structure and consequent efficiency as an organ of soundproduction . A larger number of muscles , each moving the sound-producing membrane and the cartilages to // which it is attached in a slightly different fashion , and thus ensuring variability of sound , exists in the Passerines than in any other birds . The birds that come nearest to them are the parrots , with whose powers of varied utterance every one is familiar . It is curious that perfection of voice organ does not go hand in hand with variability of voice . The hoarse crow and the melodious nightingale have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the voice of the prima donna is more flexible and varied than that of the itinerant vendor of cat 's meat , though both have a voice-producing organ of identical structure . Externally the Passerinea are to be detected by the four toes , of which the hind toe is very prominent and turned backwards , and by the fewness of the scales upon the legs . With this much by way of a preface we shall consider a typical Passerine bird , the cow bird , or more correctly the cow-pen bird , so called on account of its fondness for visiting cow-pens . This bird , known to science as Molothrus ( or , more correctly , as it appears , Molobrus , the former name having been originally a misprint ) bonariensis , is black in hue throughout , and is naturally also called the blackbird . It is of about the same size as the blackbird of this country , and is like it , a typical Passerine , with the same voice organ and structure in general . It is , indeed , the habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting and unexpected . Every one knows of the parasitic way of life of the immoral cuckoo , who entrusts to strangers the rearing of its young , and who , besides thus evading the duties as well as the pleasure of maternity and paternity , is , when young and in the foreign nest , a bloodthirsty tyrant to its fellow nestlings ; these , the rightful owners of the nest , it turns out and leaves to die upon the hard ground beneath . This very same habit is inherent in the Molothrus bonariensis , and in some of the other species // of the genus . Moreover , just as a criminal will practise upon his own class , just as there is no honour among thieves , but thief will rob thief , so one species of Molothrus , viz. , M. rufo-axillaris , will lay its eggs in the nest of M. badius , a form which is not itself parasitic . Nature has aided and abetted this iniquitous mode of life in many and varied ways . These have been carefully studied upon the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society we shall quote . The cow bird appears to have adopted the habits of the cuckoo at a later period in the history of its race than that bird , for it often makes rather serious mistakes . For example , Molothrus has been known to drop its eggs on the ground , omitting to remove them carefully and subsequently in its bill to some adjacent nest , as does the cuckoo . Its instincts are as yet so primitive and uncultured that the bird will lay its eggs in an old and deserted nest , or fail to hit the right time for egg laying , when its young , being born too late , perish of neglect at the hands of their foster parents . This latter error , however , appears to be remedied by the fact that the young are hatched especially early , and are also peculiarly strong . Molothrus , when it does successfully lay its eggs in a stranger 's nest , is apt to make assurance doubly sure by pecking at and destroying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will occasionally peck at its own eggs , or rather those of another Molothrus who has been beforehand with it . This danger to future generations of Molothri is to some extent evaded by the very hard nature of the shell , which resists pecking more efficiently than do the eggs of the unconsulted hosts . The cuckoo 's eggs , as a matter of quite common knowledge , are varied in hue , so as to give them a better chance of escaping unnoticed in the nests of their unwilling hosts . Precisely the 158 " ' ESTHETIC BIRDS same variation in colour characterizes the eggs of Molothrus bonariensis , which range from pure white through a spotty condition to eggs of a fine red throughout . Another fact which seems to show the comparative recentness of the parasitic habit is that Molothrus occasionally builds nests for itself , and inspects and shows a general interest in the nests of other birds , sometimes even altering their structure and adding a finish . BOWER BII2DS The last compartment of the Western Aviary has for a long series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violaceus ) , and , as a rule , at least some attempt is made every year by these birds to construct the " bowers " which arc known , by name at least , to most persons . This and the other kinds of bower birds are Passerine birds with no special features of structural interest except the difference , so marked , in the coloration of the two sexes . In the present species the male is a glossy violet shot black , while the female is a speckly greenish . It is the minds , however , rather than the bodies of these birds which are of such great interest , and so hard to understand . It is invariably the case that when there is a considerable difference of appearance between the two sexes , when sexual dimorphism , as it is called , occurs , that the male bird is the more brilliant in its hues of the two , and that its brilliancy of hue is emphasized by various antics which are performed in the breeding season ; this behaviour is , it is thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt to gain her favours at the exexpense of a less ably performing and duller-hued rival . As a matter of fact , such performances are not exclusively indulged in at the breeding season by all these diversely coloured birds . With the bower bird this // behaviour is complicated by a course of action which was first made known by that well equipped ornithologist , the late Mr. Gould , who went to Australia in 1837 for the joint purpose of collection and observation . The male builds with some little , but not much , assistance from the female , whose main role is to look on and admire , a kind of archway or bower made upon a platform of twigs by other twigs , interlaced where they meet at the top . Round and in this are scattered attractive objects , coloured , or startling by their whiteness . Bleached bones end gaily coloured shells and pebbles combine to form an aesthetic playing ground . Round and through this the male rushes in amorous play , delighting the female by his beauty and activity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cardinal 's ruby ring is a germ of the same , and in the bower bird more fully developed , habit . The nest , it should be remarked , has nothing to do with the bower ; it is constructed for business purposes only , and is plain and unadorned . THE GREEN WOODPECKER Woodpeckers are numerous , wherever there are trees , in nearly all parts of the world ; but they do not occur in Australia , or in that peculiarly peopled island , Madagascar . Woodpeckers are apt to be gay in colour , and of all colours . Green , red , yellow , pure white , and more dingy hues ornament the birds . Our own green woodpecker ( Gecinus viridis ) is a good type of the race to consider more closely ; and , indeed , one woodpecker is as good as another , or nearly so , to illustrate the peculiarities of this rather sharply marked off group of birds . A thick strong bill and ( save in one or two kinds ) four toes , of which two are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip upon the bark l6o HABITS OF WOODPECKER of a tree , characterize these birds . The green woodpecker , which the Nature writer genially calls " Yoffie , " is a denizen of most parts of England , and is one of our handsomest birds , green , with a yellow patch upon the back and red streaks on the head . It frequents trees , as do other woodpeckers , and extracts from crevices by means of an extraordinarily elongated tongue ( another character of the family Picidae , but not of the rest of the group Pici ) insects , upon which it feeds . The " tap , tap " of the woodpecker which , as a matter of fact , seems to be usually the nuthatch , not the woodpecker ? is , in spite of Henry Kirke White , not applied to " the hollow beech tree . " It has been justly pointed out that this is the one tree not at all suitable to woodpeckers , for the bark clings tight and does not furnish crevices wherein may lurk insects . The variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copperfield is better . The bill as an instrument serves the woodpecker for another purpose besides dislodging insects . With this heavy combined hammer and chisel the bird excavates a hole for its nest . In the hole are laid the white eggs which characterize this , as they do so many birds which deposit their eggs in concealed situations . The woodpecker exhibits the truth of the oft-quoted half line , " Sic vos non vobis , " for , after the woodpecker has arduously excavated a suitable cavern , a pair of starlings at once take possession of it for their nursery . The somewhat mocking cry of the green woodpecker has been rendered " glu-glu-glu-gluk . " It seems that there are about 350 known species of woodpeckers in the world , but only three of these live regularly in this country , though the number may of course be increased by casual visitors . Anatomically the woodpeckers seem to come nearest to the toucans and barbets . But they are a very clearly marked family , notwithstanding . Z.G. 161 M THE HORNBILL THE RHINOCEROS BIRD In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often called toucans , which is an unnecessary conHORNBILL. fusion between two perfectly distinct kinds of birds . The exclusively American toucans have , it is true , 16 ? TOUCANS AND HORNBILLS prominent bills like the hornbills of India and Africa ; but their feet have the toes in twos , one pair behind and one in front ; they are like the cuckoos and some other arboreal birds , " zygodactyle . " The hornbills have a foot which is efficient for grasping purposes , but three toes closely applied look forwards and only one backward . Still , the two families of birds are not very remote , and the one takes the place of the other in forests of the tropics of New and Old Worlds . You can tell a hornbill , as its very name denotes , by its huge bill . This would seem to necessitate an unusually strong head to sustain it . As a matter of fact , additional resistant power is arrived at in these birds by a complete fusion between the two first vertebrae of the neck , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one upon the other . Besides , the conviction of impossible top-heaviness forced upon the uninformed mind by the look of a hornbill is dissipated when the dried skull of one of these birds is inspected . It is then seen to be formed of the most delicate bony substance , arranged in a loose network of bony thread . To watch a hornbill hop lightly from bough to bough finally sets the mind at rest , and shows that Nature here , as elsewhere , has known what she was about in framing the hornbill . The bizarre suggestion of the bill , with its superincumbent casque ( not present , however , in all hornbills ) , is not borne out by an acquaintance with the way of life of the bird . It lives largely upon fruits , which a long bill enables it to wrench off from their native branches , the leverage being thereby increased . Large though these birds are , they are exceedingly light , and for reasons revealed to the anatomist . When a hornbill is dissected , it is only necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscles , nerves , and vessels stand out as if separated by painstaking use of the scalpel . The reason for this is that the flesh is dry , 163 TREE HORNBILLS AND GROUND HORNBILLS like that of a hare or an antelope , and air spaces traverse the body throughout . The bodies of all birds are aerated by expansions of the lung ; but the hornbills are particularly so , and the absence of fat conduces to this spareness of appearance . Their flight appears heavy in spite of this , and they make a great deal of noise , especially at getting off , which has been compared by Dr. Russell Wallace to the puffing of a steam engine . It is not all hornbills that lead an arboreal life . In Africa are at least two different species of ground hornbills , which are rightly placed in a distinct genus and termed Bucorax and Bucorvus . Their beak is not quite so huge as in the more exaggerated form in which it is found in Buceros and its allied tree dwellers . But it is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stateliness , and , instead of living upon fruits , catches reptiles . It is not unravenlike in aspect , and is distinctly intelligent , to judge from the numerous specimens which have been on view at the Zoo in late years . The gait of this bird has produced some alteration in the structure of the foot . It is still of the pattern of its tree-frequenting relatives ; but the inner toe of the three forwardly-directed ones has a much more massive formation than that of Buceros , and is of greater length . It is noteworthy that the same effect has been produced here as in man compared with the arboreal apes . Our great toe is the strongest of the toes , and bears most of the weight of the foot . So in the Bucorvus it is the physiological equivalent of the great toe which is correspondingly increased , for the real big toe is turned back . Now in ungulate animals which are also digitigrade , pressure upon the foot is associated with the disappearance of the outer toes and the predominance of the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeding habits that the hornbill is so remarkable and different from other birds . THE HOME OF THE HORNBILL Buceros and its allies lay white eggs and deposit them in a hole in a tree . It has been pointed out that birds that lay white eggs generally deposit them in a situation remote from the light . But this is by no means universally true . Some exceptions referred to in the present book are certain cuckoos and the podargus ; there are others . Still , the hornbills conform to this partial generalization . When the time has arrived for egglaying and incubation , the male bird carefully plasters up his wife within her dwelling and takes upon himself the care of feeding her . He remarks , in effect , that she must attend to her family and not gad about ; but at the same time does not spare himself , for males in the breeding season are frequently in a miserable physical condition . They are merely , as it has been expressed , a bag of rattling bones . On the other hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , featherless , and impotent to help themselves . This careful guarding of the family may be a defence against the prowling and marauding cat , as well as other carnivores and snakes . It is certain that the visitor will find several hornbills at the Zoo . There are in Nature more than sixty species at present known . THE " MORE-PORK , " CUVIER 'S PODARGUS Aristophanes made birds talk , and so too did Chaucer . This practice is continued by those who in modern times have invented pseudo-vernacular names for birds based upon their supposed utterances . Some of the remarks thus put into the mouths of the feathered creation have a point , others have not . As an instance of the latter is a weird-looking bird of which there have been several examples at the Zoo , the last but one of which was harboured in the insect house . This bird , Podargus cuvieri , is one of the churn owls or goatsuckers , and is a // native of Australia . The goatsuckers , or Caprimulgidae , show characters which are magnified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enormous mouths , which are carried agape in their flight and catch innumerable insects . The bill is small , since it is not needed as an assistance to feeding or fighting , the two principal occupations of the " lower " animals . The plumage of Podargus is , as is that of other goatsuckers , a soft mixture of browns and greys , a " crepuscular " hue , in fact , which assorts well with a nocturnal life . The " More-Pork " looks something like a caricature of a bird by Lear . Its head is enormous , and its body shrunken . A pair of large yellow eyes complete a picture which is ludicrous . One specimen at the Zoo was fed with new-born mice , which were gulped with ease down its huge throat . In Australia it feeds on insects . The proper name of this bird appears to be Podargus strigoides , and the name is suggestive of the resemblances of the bird . Since the owls have been by almost universal consent divorced from the hawks , their likeness to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have the same retiring shades of browns in their plumage , they fly softly like aerial Agags or moths , and they are nocturnal . All this , of course , is hardly enough to prove a close alliance . But the facts may be slight indications which will be confirmed by later studies of the birds . It is curious , too , and not unsuggestive , that in New Zealand the name " More-Pork " is applied to an owl . Our bird is naturally considered to be a bird of ill-omen on account of its really ghastly looks , and its habit of sitting upon tombstones confirms the popular view . Its near ally , the oil-bird , or guacharo , of South America , shares its ill-omencd reputation , which is enhanced by a living in caves . The Podargus is remarkable among goatsuckers for building a nest on branches . The others lay eggs on the ground . The tribe generally does not lend itself to confinement , and it is unlikely that the visitor will meet with more than one example of the 167 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zoo ; and that will doubtless be a Podaygus . THE SNOWY OWL It is true that visitors to the Zoological Gardens are not so much in search of British animals as of unfamiliar exotics ; but the snowy owl ( Nyctea nivea ) may be fairly taken as an example of the owl tribe , though it does occasionally creep , intrude , or climb into the fold of British birds . It can not , however , be really considered to be a British bird in the full sense of the adjective , inasmuch as it is at most a rare straggler . As its plumage really tells us , the snowy owl is a fowl of circumpolar range , though some ornithologists have differentiated an American from an European form . These birds prefer the desolate and snowy tracts of the extreme north , and " there , " as Isaiah said , " shall the great owl make her nest , and lay , and hatch , and gather under her shadow . " The late Dr. Stanley , in his well-known book upon birds , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when surprised in more temperate latitudes , as it has been on more than one occasion , hopped from snowy patch to snowy patch , and avoided the snowless intervals , where it would be more conspicuous . The bird is , in fact , one of those polar creatures , like the white bear , which appear to be coloured in relation to their normal surroundings , and in which this white colour is borne winter and summer alike . Nyctea , however , is not wholly white , but spotted with black . This owl is typically owl-like in its form ; indeed , the group of Strigid is one which is sharply marked off from other birds ; there is never any doubt whatever about a given bird as to whether it is or is not an owl . It is also one of the largest of owls , and dispels in its own person a common belief about owls , i.e. that they are not only nocturnal , but can not bear to look upon i68 NAMES OF OWLS the sun . The snowy owl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of perpetual daylight , would fare but badly were it to be nocturnal or even crepuscular . The popular belief in the night-loving habits of owls is , of course , accurate in so far that the majority of owls do , as a matter of fact , hunt at night . But that is quite a different thing from saying that no owl can suffer the day . The names Heliodilus , " sun-fearer , " and Photodilus , " light fearer , " serve only to perpetuate this inaccuracy . These names are those of two Madagascar genera of owls . The snowy owl does not share in a curious defect of organization which mars many owls . The earholes , particularly large , do not show either superficially or in the underlying skull an asymmetry which is a common feature of strigine architecture . Like others of its kind , Nyctea nivea ( or scandiaca ; it has several names , like most birds that have been long known ) is rapacious in mode of life , a characteristic which involves adequate beak and claw , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawks , eagles , and vultures , and separating them only from those birds as nocturnal Rapaces . On the other hand , the noiseless flight , the dull greys and browns of colour have led some to associate these birds with the tribe of goatsuckers ; a likeness of plumage and flight which may be , after all , not so delusive as a test of affinity as some such resemblances are apt to be . All that one can say at present with even moderate certainty is that the Striges are not hawks ; they are not by any means to be placed in the same division with the Accipitres . What they are exactly is left to future enquirers ; at present the anatomical knowledge , and also the absence of intermediate types which show a leaning , forbids any dogmatism . The snowy owl pursues birds , and has , as have most carnivorous creatures , a distinct partiality for the wounded and therefore defenceless birds . It is // said also to fish . Though the snowy owl is no longer to be reckoned an inhabitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late years is probably to be looked upon as due to amelioration of climate . For the discovery of bones , or , to be accurate , a single bone , in the celebrated cavern , Kent 's Hole , near Torquay , shows unmistakably that the snowy owl in former and colder periods was a genuine dweller in the south of England . In relation to the colour of this owl and its habitat , it is interesting to note that the Virginian eagle owl ( Bubo virginianus ) , a bird also to be found in the Gardens ) , is whiter as it approaches nearer to the north . THE KEA PARROT . New Zealand has only a few kinds of parrots to boast of , unlike the neighbouring Australia . There are not more than half a dozen species or so , but two at least of these are of extreme interest ; these two are the owl parrot or kakapo ( Strigops habroptilus ) , a flightless form with the face of an owl , as its name denotes , and of peculiar structure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we shall speak here . This bird , which is known by the scientific name of Nestor notabilis , is of a dull olive-green hue for the most part , the feathers being tipped with black . The rump and the inside of the wing are red . It has a long bill and is a good-sized parrot altogether . It used to be classed with the Australian and Eastern lories ; but Dr. Garrod , at one time Prosector of the Zoological Society , proved that it is not akin to those brush-tongued parrots , although the tongue is slightly frayed out at the end . He thought it to be a near ally of the typical parrots represented in almost every house in this country by the familiar and African grey parrot . Others have thought that it should be raised to the dignity of a special family among the I70 I HABITS OF THE KEA parrots , and in that position we shall leave it without further comment . The general aspect of the bird will leave no doubt upon the mind of the visitor that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not occur to him that this bird is a murderous fowl , which has as it were deliberately trodden the Accipitrine path and deserted the innocent and frugivorous ways of most of the parrot tribe . Inasmuch as there are , or were , some ornithologists who regarded the parrots in general as modified hawks , this revived taste for flesh seems to have a meaning ; but , on the whole , it is to be pointed out that the parrot tribe , whatever their real affinities are , are not to be placed anywhere near to the eagles , vultures , and hawks , in spite of their hooked beak and sere at the nostril . Probably they are to be looked upon as nearer to the plantain-eaters of Africa and to various allies of those . In days gone by the kea was a vegetarian , or at most an insect-eating bird . But with the colonization of New Zealand came in due course mutton , and the kea adopted the habit of loafing round sheep-killing establishments and nibbling at garbage . From this comparatively harmless taste the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nowadays a herd of keas will surround and kill a live sheep , particularly perhaps a weakly one . So successful did these raids become that the government was invoked to protect the farmer and the slaughterer . It seems to have taken some time for the kea to develop fully this noxious and carnivorous habit . For the facts of its depredations were only published for the first time in a scientific journal so lately as 1871 ; and the advent of specimens at the Zoo have never failed to elicit from the daily press further comments on what is indeed a genuinely remarkable fact . It is frequently remarked in such communications that the goal of the kea 's bill is the kidney fat . It is true that the lumbar region is the one // generally attacked , and a well-known surgeon exhibited some years since a preparation of a sheep so treated , in which the bird had performed the operation of " colotomy , " or cutting into the large intestine . But it is now certain that the kea actually prefers lean to fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike that gentleman , will eat both substances . One might think possibly that this change of feeding habits ? which may ultimately be responsible for a change in at least the digestive organs of subsequent keas , and be thus a most excellent example of the influence of man upon faunas ? having been acquired would be fixed , and that animal food would now be a necessity . This , however , is not so . Specimens at the Zoo have been fed on ordinary parrot food , and have thriven thereon and showed no symptoms of pining for unnatural mutton chops . Nevertheless , mutton chops have often been freely supplied to these birds when in the parrot house . The capacity for an entire change of diet gives the philosopher room " furiously to think , " for it seems likely that many kinds of beasts in the past have disappeared from the face of nature through inability to adopt such liberal opinions , and it is a fact that omnivorous creatures , who need therefore place but little dependence upon the vagaries of Nature , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like others , has a voice . Sir Walter Buller asserts that it mews like a cat , and that it also utters a " whistle , a chuckle , and a suppressed scream , " a round of noises which is unsurpassed in the bird tribe . This flexibility of voice ( and it may be added that the kea can be instructed in the art of the usual parrot unpolite conversation ) depends partly in these birds upon the complicated structure of the voice organ . That organ has several muscles pulling different ways , and thus allowing of much change in the shape of the air column , which causes the vocal chords to vibrate // and thus sound . It lives a good deal on the ground , as might be supposed from its propensities to convert sheep into mutton . And when on the ground it hops in a corvine fashion instead of adopting the more usual psittacine waddle . Nestor meridionalis is the only other living species , and its Maori vernacular name is caption Kaka . This Nestor does not appear to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds upon insects , and is more arboreal than its ally . Both species may be seen at the Zoo from time to time . Both also nest in crevices of rocks , and of course , as all parrots do , lay white eggs . The laying of white eggs is correlated with a concealed nest , but the correlation does not amount at all to anything like cause and effect . For eggs placed in exposed // nests are sometimes white , and coloured eggs are often secretly hidden from prying pard and other egg eaters . The New Zealand archipelago once nourished two other species of Nestor , both of which are now quite extinct , so far as we know , though the recent occurrence of the supposed extinct rail , Notornis manic/1i , makes us careful in making too clear a statement on the point . It seems unlikely , however , that we shall ever see again either Nestor productus or Nestor norfolcensis . THE KOEL As a representative , and that a very typical one , of the cuckoo tribe we shall select the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name apparently more correctly runs ) . This bird , like other cuckoos , has what is called a zygodactyle foot ; that is , the toes are arranged in twos , one pair being turned forwards and the other backwards . The " great " toe and the fourth toe are those which are turned backwards , and the result of this is an effective grasping organ , from which alone it might be safely inferred that the cuckoos are arboreal birds . And yet this generalization is marred by the fact that there are cuckoos which pass at least a great deal of their time upon the ground , such as the American Roadrunner ( Geococcyx ) . That originally cuckoos were typical " insessores " seems however to be clear . The koel is at least often to be seen at the Gardens , and it is one of the few cuckoos in which the two sexes vary greatly in colour . In fact the variation in plumage from the cock to the hen is as great as in any bird . The cock bird is black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In our common cuckoo , Cuculus canorus , a careful examination shows slight , but very slight , differences of colour in the two sexes . It has a good strong curved beak and yet , unlike our cuckoo , who seems to take a delight in the most bristly // and " warningly coloured " of caterpillars , the koel is a pure vegetarian . This bird in its several species is widely ranging in the East , but belongs entirely to the eastern hemisphere . Its name is plainly onomatopoeic . Its voice is melodious , and we are informed that it is used by the youthful oriental as a comparison standard of the voice of his beloved as is its plumage of her beauty . But on the other hand it is black of heart like other cuckoos , and leaves to others the care of bringing up its offspring . This cuckoo lays its eggs for choice in the nests of the Indian crow ( Corvus sp , lendens ) , and it is remarkable that the wiliest among Indian birds does not frustrate its unbidden guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crow in colour , though smaller ; it is said that the newly hatched cuckoo ejects its foster brethren in the good old fashion of the British cuckoo . It diverges from its ally in this country in the fact that it is not migratory , and is entirely stay-athome . Some would write the name cuckoo " cuckow , " a reversion to an older , but not in our opinion " more scholarly , " method of orthography . For as the word is , like the word " koel , " distinctly formed in imitation of the note of the bird itself , other old transliterations might be invoked . Thus we might insist upon calling the bird " Gukgo , " and indeed that word is a trifle more suggestive of the bird when he " alters his tune " in June . There are at least two remarkable facts about the cuckoo tribe , with the outlines of which every one is acquainted , and about which it is necessary to say something . The parasitical habits have been known from the remotest antiquity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are still problems that require solution . It is always mentioned as a curiosity of the history of Natural History , that the habits of the cuckoo were largely elucidated by the discoverer of vaccination , Jenner . What the cuckoo 175 r ti PARASITISM OF CUCKOOS actually does is broadly this . The eggs are produced rather continuously , so that the bird could not very well place them all in one nest and then proceed to the duties of incubation . The process would be too long for the life of the parent . Thus it has had recourse to its well-known habit . In accordance with the varied hospitality upon which the cuckoo insists , the eggs vary greatly in colour ; but whether there is always a correspondence between the nest selected and the colour of the eggs laid therein is not so certain . It has been suggested that individual cuckoos acquire the habit of laying their eggs in the nests of a given species , or even for a series of seasons in the nests of the same individual . That therefore the eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those of the adopted foster parent , and that the variety of egg coloration in the cuckoo is a matter of individual cuckoos , and not individual eggs of the same cuckoo . It is furthermore plain that the young cuckoo is stronger and more muscular than its fellow nestlings and that it actually does forcibly eject them . But this predatory instinct on behalf of its young is not universal in the cuckoo tribe . All the immediate allies of the Cuculus canorus of our islands are parasitic . But Eudynamis is the one exception apparently among the group of cuckoos to which it belongs that shows this characteristically cuculine habit . This shows of course that the habit is but a recent one , a point of view that is supported by the rare occurrence ( one case at any rate has been authenticated ) , of common cuckoos building a nest of their own , and attending to their own offspring The lark-footed cuckoo ( Centro pus ) , usually to be seen in the Zoo , is not parasitic . Now it is interesting that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assistance of other birds , lays a white egg . The parasitic species have apparently all of them spotted and // blotched eggs , so that they are more or less like the average bird 's egg . Another matter of interest concerning cuckoos is the frequently close likeness which many of them bear to other birds of quite different groups . This " mimicry " is to be seen in our own cuckoo , whose likeness to a hawk was commented upon by Aristotle . That small birds share in the deception seems to be shown by the fact that they will " mob " a cuckoo , apparently under the impression that they are annoying their hereditary enemy . The Indian " brain fever bird " ( Hierococcyx ) , is still more like a hawk , and it has deceived into a state of excitement small birds at the Zoo . The advantage of such a likeness may be held to be proved in these cases where a superficial resemblance may protect a feeble bird from assaults on the part of ravening , but timid and suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat different in their nature . A large Sumatran ground cuckoo ( Carpococcyx radiatus ) lately exhibited in the Insect House at the Zoo , had the swaggering strut of that " miles gloriosus " among birds , the " game bird . " It may be that here the aspect of the cuckoo suggested to the hawk that under the swaggering gait lay an armature of spurs . The cuckoo to which we have already referred , viz. Centro pus , includes a species which is named " phasianus , " a name which suggests precisely the same kind of similarity . TOURACOU The touracous with their brilliant colours , often red and green , are common occupants of the cages at the Zoo . These beautiful birds are African , and only African , in range . They are eminently tree-frequenting birds , and the outer toe is reversible in order that it can enable the bird to grapple with different needs as it moves from branch to branch . It is generally held that the Z.G. I77 N COLOURS OF TOURACOU touracous come nearest to the cuckoos in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , they are a somewhat isolated race . The principal fact of interest about them is the red colouring matter of the wing feathers . In considering the peacock , it is pointed out that colours in birds ' feathers may or may not depend upon the presence in the feather of a pigment of that particular hue . In the peacock the bright metallic tints are the product of the feather structure and of a blackish pigment below . In the touracou , on the contrary , the red feathers contain a red pigment , which can be dissolved out , and which shows in solution the same fine colour that it shows when embedded in the substance of the feathers . Some characteristics of this pigment have given rise to what must be regarded as rather a legendary history . It has been noticed that in wet weather these birds confine themselves to the densest shades of their native thickets , a proceeding on their part which is not at all unusual for a bird . But a special reason for this was alleged in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved out by the warm tropical rain , leaving the feather blanched . It was furthermore added , with perhaps an eye to paradox and effect , that when the bird was shot and happened to fall into water , it dyed the stream red , not with its own blood , but with the dissolved crimson pigment . The actual facts upon which these statements have been based is that the colour can be removed from the feathers by steeping them in alkalis . And furthermore that ordinary tap water , which is as a rule slightly alkaline , will be tinged to a perceptible extent after a feather has been steeped in it , particularly if the water be warm . It is , however , doubtful whether a touracou is bleached by exposure to a tropical or any downpour . The name turacin has been applied to this pigment , and it is characterized , a somewhat 178 ( I CRANES AND STORKS rare occurrence among animal pigments , by having a spectrum with absorption bands . It furthermore contains copper . It is a highly interesting fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the family is termed , to the cuckoos , that the same pigment has been found in a cuckoo . THE GOLDEN CROWNED CRANE This bird , the handsomest though not the largest of the cranes , sensu siricto , is one of those birds which may certainly be found in one of the outside paddocks of the Zoo . In fact , cranes generally are a strong feature in the Gardens , and nearly all the known species have been exhibited . A great many may usually be seen at any given time , and thus the visitor can note the points in which this crane differs from its allies . It has , as in cranes generally , a sharp and longish beak , though not so long as in the typical cranes of the genus Grus ; its legs again are long , but not so long as in the typical cranes . It has , however , what no other crane has , a Lift of golden coloured feathers , consisting merely of the stems of the feathers without their lateral branches , the barbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its popular name . The cranes , as a race , could only be confounded with the storks , to which their long and pointed bills ally them . But this apparent likeness , as well as the fact that both groups of birds have long legs , is not a sufficient reason for placing them near together in the face of certain profound differences . Even by external characters it is easy to draw a line between the storks and cranes . The latter have a small hind toe , and the nostrils are far forward on the beak ; in storks the hind toe is large and the nostril is at the base of the beak . Internally there are important differences , especially in the skull . In the stork tribe the bony palate is continuous across the // mouth , while in the cranes a soft interval is left in the middle line . Cranes , moreover , do not as a rule perch high up in trees or upon buildings ; while both herons and storks do . Our particular crane is a native of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two species , to which the scientific names of Balearica chrysopelargus and B. pavonina are applied . Balearica suggests another habitat ; but apparently the occurrence of either species of crane away from Africa is extremely rare . It has , however , been alleged to have been , in the eighteenth century , an inhabitant of the Balearic islands . This evidence however , when duly sifted , appears to amount to a statement by a Spanish gentleman who died in 1784 , that he had heard it said that a specimen was found in those islands in the year 1780 . Its rarity in Europe and Northern Africa and its occasional wanderings into these countries , coupled with its beautiful crown of gold , may perhaps be at the bottom of the phoenix stories . Tacitus tells how in the consulship of Fabius and Vitellius , " Post longum. saeculorum ambitum avis phoenix in Aegyptum venit . " Now so rare is the crowned crane in Egypt that the late Mr. Blyth could find no record of its occurrence in that country . Thus a rarely appearing bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feathers , would strike an imaginative people as something odd ; and out of these actual facts one hardly knows what superstructure may have been built . There is a pretty tall one if the phoenix has anything to do with this bird . Barring the eagle 's beak , the crowned crane would serve as an excellent replica of the phoenix in the so-called Life Assurance Corporation 's advertisement . We are , however , concerned here with a living and very real , and not with a fabulous , bird . In the skull of the crowned crane is a curious feature which is not a little deceptive . Underneath the crest the fore-i8o r HORNS IN BIRDS head shows a pair of elevations of the bone which suggest exactly the bony horn basis in certain mammals . It seems to us very probable that if nothing were known concerning this crane save its skull-cap , it would have gone down to posterity as a horned bird . And very likely the tiny horn on the head of the horned screamer ( Palamedea cornuta ) , a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another page , would have been quoted as the last vestige in a living bird of a former horned race . But the crane is not horned , only crested . The deep note of cranes , of intense loudness , is familiar to all visitors to the Zoo , and is especially to be heard at evening . It is aided by the long windpipe , which is coiled like a trumpet and adds of course by this increase of length to the volume of the sound produced . This special arrangement is not found in our crowned cranes , who are thus less specialized and more primitive representatives of the crane tribe than the remaining forms . THE SCREAMER South America is the home of many waning races of birds and beasts ; in its dense forests there lurk representatives of whole groups , which once flourished abundantly upon the the land , but are now reduced to scarce waifs and strays , the flotsam and jetsam of a previous order of things . There is one living " diprotodont " marsupial , the sole remnant of the otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with two allies in Africa and the East , the sole remains of a group of birds possibly antecedent to the widely spread rails and water hens of the rest of the world ; the mysterious Guacharo or oil-bird is of a type peculiar to itself at present , and the " Four-footed " bird of the northern parts of the South American continent ( Opisthocomus cristatus ) has not a single close ally living anywhere else . Among this wreckage are to be // placed the birds known as Screamers or Kamichis , known to us by three species , usually referred to two distinct genera , viz. Chauna and Palaniedea . The Derbian or the crested screamer ( Chauna derhiana and C. cristata ) is a bird which looks like nothing else in the bird way . It has the head of a fowl attached to the body of a good-sized goose , the whole surmounted upon longish legs with straddling toes . The long legs suggest wading , and the large " feet " with divaricated toes safe progression upon treacherous and marshy soil . The bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likeness to a goose is not wholly a matter of outward appearance . But it can not be definitely placed in that large order , which includes the geese , swans and ducks ; rather is it to be looked upon as the vestige of a group which perhaps produced , as a mere side issue , the anatiform birds . The main stem with its archaic characters has come down to us in these three desolate birds which form the subject of the present article . The chaunas have a puffed out and even gouty appearance about the legs . Coupled with a slowish gait this suggests overfeeding , a complaint which is not unknown at the Zoo through the unnecessary kindness of visitors . It is , however , merely a conspicuous expression of a state of affairs which characterizes birds in general and not the screamers only . These birds , like others , are literally " puffed out with wind and the rank mist they draw " in order to lighten their sometimes cumbrous bodies . The lungs of birds are not simply bags more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they communicate with a complex system of ramifying air cavities spread through the body and permeating even their very bones . There is hardly a portion of the bird 's body which is free from air-containing spaces , a state of affairs which obviously aids it in spurning the // dull earth . But curiously enough , in view of the fact that in nature the coat seems to be invariably cut according to the cloth , the amount of aeration is not precisely correspondent with the capacity for flight . So thoroughly is the body of the screamer lightened in this way that when the skin is pressed it absolutely crackles with exploding bubbles . The chauna , however , though largely a ground bird , can fly and soar to a great height . Mr. W. H. Hudson described it as circling upwards like the lark and uttering continuously its melodious sounds from the topmost air . The visitor will perhaps hardly agree with the author of that delightful and instructive work , The Naturalist in la Plata in considering the screams of the chauna as tuneful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melody is lost ; and in any case a distance and rarefied air may produce a softening of the ear-piercing-shrieks of the captive bird more reminiscent of the lark than one is disposed to admit after a visit to the Zoo . For when a pair of these birds , aided by the friendly rivalry of the cariama , the other screamer , really lay themselves out for a prolonged conversation , the noise is almost insupportable . Far out in the wilds of Regent 's Park this awful din can be heard , farther away than any of the multitudinous sounds inherent in the menagerie . The Palamedea differs in a number of points from Chauna . The most striking unlikeness is in its possession of a single and small horn upon the forehead . It can not be very serviceable either for defensive or offensive purposes , on account of its weakness and flexibility . Besides , if Palamedea , or for that matter Chauna too , feel any desire for aggression , and they often do , each wing has a hard and exceedingly serviceable horny outgrowth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurs are found in some other birds , for instance in the appropriately named " Spur-winged Goose . " // The horn on the head must therefore be either a sexual adornment or a relic from the past . In the latter case it may perhaps be looked upon as an inheritance from those long since defunct and bird-like reptiles , the Dinosaurs ; and like an armorial bearing of a military kind , be rather a mark of aristocracy than an indication of a pugnacious and offensive character . We have intimated that the screamers are of ancient lineage . That conclusion is accepted on account of the fact that they can not be definitely referred to any existing group of birds , coupled with certain traces of reptilian conditions in their organization . The most noteworthy of these is the character of the ribs , which have not , as have all other existing birds without exception , certain 185
