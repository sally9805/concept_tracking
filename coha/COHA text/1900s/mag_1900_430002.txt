" By the time July is well started , " observes the gentle author of " Friends Worth Knowing , " in his newer work , " Nature 's Calendar , " the rains have ceased , the woods are deep in the shadow of completed leafage and growing twigs , the soil is dry and is throwing out an increasing crop of curious agarics , and walking in the dusty roads or open uplands is unpleasant . Naturally enough , then , we turn in our rambles towards the watercourses and seek to read the ' books in the running brooks . ' " Mr. Ingersoll does not say , as he could have said , that the opening of July is the very crown and summit of the year ; nor could he have known that this year of grace , 1900 , finds it a most exceptional time for seeing the outdoor world at its very best , abundant and early rains and moderate temperatures having given promise of a July that does not need to have its face washed for the dust upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to observe the real beauties of this earth of ours , so far removed from the political turmoil in which that country is about to plunge . Nor should we , unless we know them thoroughly , neglect the lessons that are to be gained from so charming an assortment of books as have been provided for summer instruction and entertainment . " Nature 's Calendar " is a book for the year , containing on its broad pages " a slender rivulet of text " of much charm and pertinency , while beside and under it is a space of white marked for every day of the year , whereon notes may be made to supplement the observations of the author . But it is a calendar in another sense as well , for at the end of each of the months is set forth such a summary of the habits of live things , birds , reptiles , fishes , and insects , that the least observant can load himself with hints to make obvious and familiar at least a part of a world before invisible . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taste in all its essentials , twelve reproductions of as many photographs by Mr. Clarence Lown afford typical views of fields , forests , and rivers . Beautifully printed on paper which leaves one vexed that glazed surfaces have ever been tolerated , with nearly a hundred illustrations by Mr. Oliver Kemp to interpret the thought in another medium , Dr. Charles C. Abbott 's " In Nature 's Realm " is a book to be treasured . Serenely philosophical , keenly observant , intellectually suggestive , the placid marshalling of the less obvious facts of nature , with their gentle spiritual interpretation from Dr. Abbott 's pen to make us all human together , is a real triumph of literature . He discusses , to take one example from scores , " My Point of View , " and his breadth is made ours if we read him aright when he says : " I am what I am to nature , not what another , from his point of view , judges I should be . I am a part of nature and nature is a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am ruined . Hence the futility of attempting radical changes ; for nations and countries and climates have their peculiar points of view , and the Christianized pagan is still but a pagan Christianized . His idol may be a fraud , but it will never cease to be his idol . The outward sign of respect may be withheld , but the inward feeling of regard can never die . Who has seen the world with another 's eyes ? There is a cuttle-fish that can blacken the waters about it until the animal disappears , but the water is water still , and the animal is only bidden , not changed nor annihilated . The oak does not ask the elm to change its leaves , nor roses red taunt the violets because they are blue , ? why then seek to change my point of view and blur the landscape that to me is beautiful and so a joy forever ? The intensity of a personality that dwarfs others is more likely to prove a curse than a blessing . My limited individuality has its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature is a better director than man in this regard . " There is much more of this delightful and humane philanthropy , which contrasts so abruptly with the turmoil and warfare of the world ? due chiefly , it may be remarked , to the fact that we are not satisfied with burghers as burghers , Filipinos as Filipinos , or Mongols as Mongols , but are madly seeking to make them British , or American , or Caucasian , as the case may be . When the world has learned , like Dr. Abbott , that a man 's point of view is his own , and that he is accountable for it to God alone , we shall all of us be in a fair way of being civilized , instead of merely thinking ourselves so . Mrs. William Starr Dana 's " How to Know the Wild Flowers " can hardly need extended  | notice at this time , since the new edition announces itself the fifty-sixth thousand . It differs from its predecessors by the inclusion of forty-eight colored plates after the water-color sketches by Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained in former editions being omitted here , and almost as many new ones being added from the faithful flower portraits of Miss Marion Satterlee . The text stands as it did seven years ago , and the book in its present form leaves little to be desired . Miss Alice Lounsberry 's " Guide to the Trees " and Mrs. Harriet L. Keeler 's " Our Native Trees " differ chiefly in the personal equation of the two writers . Both give , with all the fulness desirable , the means whereby component members of American forests can be distinguished one from another , and their names ascertained with the least amount of trouble . In addition to this groundwork , which includes a complete description of the tree in all its details , ? bark , leaves , flowers , and fruit , ? Miss Lounsberry 's book contains a great number of colored and black-and-white pictures and diagrams made by Mrs. Ellis Rowan , and a brief introduction by Dr. N. L. Britton . Mrs. Keeler 's work is illustrated by reproductions of photographs direct from nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many drawings of details . It is a work which is less formal than the other , and with more of the literary quality . Quite as instructive , it sets forth the technicalities in popular language , while the photographs of leaves serve a better purpose in the process of identification . Either of the books is a desirable addition to the library . Mr. Charles A. Keeler is already well known for his delightful writings after the manner of a Californian Thoreau , and " Bird Notes Afield " will enhance his reputation both as a man of letters and of science . He deals with the birds of the Pacific coast more particularly , and his statement of the differences and resemblances of these with the feathered folk of regions nearer the rising sun makes very delightful reading . Many of his studies have been made in the vicinity of Berkeley , for which the pleasant book of Miss Eva IT . Carlin , published more than a year ago , serves as an introduction . He tells of the domestic life of the hummingbird , as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered an unfinished nest , you may observe the mother bird 's methods of work . She settles upon it and rounds it with her breast . Seemingly with difficulty the head is raised and the long , slender beak arranges here and there a bit of lichen , bark , or cobweb in its proper place on the outside . Thus she works until the compact little structure of softest thistledown , covered on the outside with small fragments of moss , lichen , bark , and similar materials , is ready to receive the invariable two white eggs . In due course of time the most helpless young imaginable are hatched , to be tended with unremitting care . They soon grow so large that their diminutive home can scarcely contain them until , at last , from the sheer physical necessity of overcrowded quarters , they are forced to essay a flight . Wonderful , indeed , is the domestic life of these smallest of birds , in whose minute frame is compacted so much of intelligence and passion ? so much that we fondly claim as human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper on " Patrolling the Beach , " in which nature in her most ferocious aspect , after a storm at sea , is followed in her work of devastation . The book , which is most alluringly designed , concludes with a key whereby the various birds of California may be differentiated and identified , the arrangement being such that no scientific knowledge is required for its use . " Bird Homes , " by Mr. Radclyffe Dugmore , is such a book as every lover of birds must welcome , since it really admits the reader into the privacy of their family life . It is , moreover , an eloquent plea for acquaintance with our tiny neighbors as the best means of preserving them from the cruelties which make us ashamed of the name of human . One or two of the instances Mr. Dugmore cites are quite too harrowing for repetition here . But such a paragraph as this is worth taking to heart : " I think any woman who had seen a mother-thrush on the nest , with her anxious , wild little eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again wear a stuffed bird as a hat ornament , to be used for a short month or two and then thrown away . For herein lies , perhaps , the chief cause of the partial extermination of our birds , both those that are sombre in color ( for they can be dyed to any desired shade ) and those that are by nature of brilliant hues . And who gains by this cruel sacrifice to a heartless fashion save the dealers ? " A similar warning is addressed to the boy who begins an egg collection . Instructions are given which will enable the eggs to be taken without inflicting the birds with calamity , but a still stronger argument is made for observing the conduct of the young when hatched . It is to descriptions of this sort , admirably illustrated by instantaneous photographs in reproduction of the birds , old and young , in various stages of home building and family rearing . that the book is chiefly devoted ; and no better argument for the use of a camera instead of a  | gun could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his text : " Have you numbered all the birds of the wood , Without a gun ? Have you loved the wild rose ? And left it on its stalk ? 0 be my friend , and teach me to be thine . " Not only does the book abound in photographic reproductions , many of them in color , but there are several plates of eggs which will give the reader most of the advantages of a collection without the possibility of inflicting misery upon the small friends whom self-interest no less than humanity urges us to protect . Mr. Dugmore is to be congratulated on the execution of his gentle and pious task . Of even greater interest than the book just noticed is Mr. F. M. Chapman 's pleasant narrative of " Bird Studies with a Camera . " Mr. Chapman is the first American to discern the advantages which the exceedingly clever book of the Messrs . Kearton , " Wild Life at Home , " held out to those happy folk who are amateurs in both photography and ornithology . Though his book is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , and ground of another sort , without being quite so detailed . The two works , taken together , will form a course both elementary and advanced in the pleasant application of the two sciences of which it treats . Mr. Chapman has been along the Atlantic coast and to the islands in the St. Lawrence in search of subjects , and he discourses on pelicans and plovers with the ease which Mr. Dugmore bestows on bobolinks and blackbirds . Nests and eggs play their part with both , and so do the facts about lenses and hyposulphites ; Mr. Chapman being more specific in respect to the latter . So ends a charming task , most amiably suited to the crowning season of the year . Insects and flowers , butterflies and roses , birds and trees , fields and rivers , these are surely among the loveliest things on earth .  |
