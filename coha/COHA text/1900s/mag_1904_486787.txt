With the current week ends the Presidential canvass , the least excited , noisy and demonstrative  --  we might almost say the least conversational  --  within the memory of man . This paradox  --  in view of the spectacular attributes of one of the candidates , as well as of the number and gravity of the issues at stake  --  has engaged the attention of the thoughtful , and awaits the light which the election may throw upon it . No single issue has asserted its preeminence , and no bugaboo has been maintainable since Judge Parker took the currency out of the debate . " The Street " has been absolutely unaffected by the political movement : Indeed , the chief interest of the hour has attached to State rather than to national fortunes . The feeble signs of life in the Republican machine corpse , evidenced by what has been going on in Wisconsin , Illinois , and Massachusetts ; the revolt against corruption in Missouri  --  have saved the periodic function from being stale and featureless ; and that way lies the hope of reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison Square Garden on Monday night  --  so great that , for a wonder , it could not be rated as a " frost " in the headlines of the Republican organs  --  is but one sign more of a rising Democratic tide in this city and State . No one can be blind to IL , whatever inference he may draW . New York , we may remark , has been more familiar with Mr. Roosevelt 's career than any other portion of the Union , and is therefore in a position correctly to measure his value and usefulness . In this it does not need any assistance from Messrs . Hay and Root and other official apologists and eulogists . Judge Parker 's speeches are certainly of the kind to win him votes wherever he goes , for he is direct , earnest , sincere , and weighty , and makes friends the instant he t3hows himself . In discussing the tariff on Friday , he was both lucid and forcible . His illustration should have brought home to his listeners the real nature of the burden which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , a collector went through the country urging that every man , woman , and child contribute according to his means to the coffers of the United States Steel Corporation , the proposal would be received With jeers . No argument could persuade people that " the good of the country " required from everybody even While the commissioning of Gen. Leonard Wood and Collector Crum during a " constructive recess " of the Senate is not one of the great issues of the campaign , it is yet extremely interesting for the light it throws on Mr. Roosevelt 's attitude toward the constitutional limitations of his power . The Parker Constitution Club , therefore , made a wise selection in devoting its third report to this subject . On what is primarily a legal question , the opinion of the eminent lawyers whose names are signed to the report should carry great weight . But , to the layman , the lesson of the whole transaction is very simple . The straightforward , shoulder-hitting Administration , in order to keep a few favored military and civil appointees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicalities . The notion that , between twelve o'clock and twelve , o'clock of a certain day there was a " recess of the Senate " within the meaning of the Constitution , as the Club 's lawyers put it , " finds its parallel only in the arguments of the Scholiasts . " A veteran legislator like Senator Hale called it " a strained construction of which I have never been able to find a father , " while so adroit an advocate as Senator Spooner said , " I do not intend to give approval to the notion that there can be a constructive recess . " The " chimera ruminating in a vacuum " belonged no more exclusively to the realm of metaphysics than Mr. Root 's explanation that " there can be no end of a session until a time is reached when there is no session , and the time when there is no session is a recess . " The question is not merely a nice point for the lawyers , bearing only on some appointments and the collectorship of one district . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he the President attempted to make a permanent appointment by means of a succession of temporary appointments , thus seeking to do indirectly what he was not permitted to do directly . - Such a proceeding constituted a most serious and menacing departure from the Constitution . " For one who has had so much experience with Philippine affairs , Secretary Taft made a remarkably inexact statement in Brooklyn the other day . According to the newspaper report of his speech he said " By taking Manila , Dewey took the Philippine Islands . " But surely the Secretary ought to have known that the Court of Claims has-passed upon this very question in the case of Warner , Barnes &; Co. against the United States , in which the company sued for the repayment of certain duties levied between April 11 , 1899 , and November 15 , 1901 . When the case was argued , the whole contention of the War Department and of its officers who testified went to show that the duties levied were not collected in time of peace , or when the islands were under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Claims held that , in the state of war existing in the Philippines , all things were done " as if the war had been a public one with a foreign nation . " And it carefully explained that the treaty of peace merely gave the United States the right to take the islands and try to establish its sovereignty . Not until July 1 , 1902 , was this done , according to the Court of Claims , and then only by employing 126,468 soldiers and at a cost of 4,374 American lives . For Mr. Taft to give the impression to-day that the islands were ours from the moment that Dewey sailed into Manila Bay , is distinctly misleading . " How would the Opposition 's remedy of free trade in Trust-made articles hurt the Standard Oil Company ? " asked Sen- , ator Beveridge in a campaign speech the other day . " There is no tariff on oil . " It is true that the tariff law imposes no specific duties on oil , but Se &ion; 626 provides that in every case where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the United States shall collect an equal duty on these same articles . Instead of there being no duty on oil , there are so many duties that it takes a sizable Government pamphlet to enumerate them . Russia 's duty , for in : stance , is 1 ruble per pood , and is equivalent in our standards to $0.002852 per gallon . Allowing 81/2 pounds to the gal --  Ion , the unit familiar to the consumer , the rates from the important foreign countries work out approximately as follows : Austro-Hungary , 15.6 cents ; Finland , 1.7 cents ; France , 6.6 cents ; Germany , 5.6 cents ; Greece , 29 cents ; Italy , 35.7 cents ; Netherlands , 0 8 cent ; Portugal , 27.8 cents ; Russia , 2.4 cents ; Spain , 18.5 cents ; Switzerland , 0.9 cent ; Canada , 5.5 cents . Of course , in these cases we have practically delegated the power of fixing our tariff schedules to foreign Gov. - ernments , but the duties are there ; and so long as they exist it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hay 's presentation of the reasons for a second Hague conference should be of much help in making it a success . The Russian-British agreement for an international commission to inquire into the actual facts of the North Sea incident makes the hour of the invitation timely . Indeed , the war in the East had already done that , for even if Japan and Russia should be unwilling to meet the other nations at The Hague , the horrible slaughter in Mantchuria should make the rest of the world the more zealous in the cause of peace . There are many questions of international law to be settled , upon which there should easily be agreement . The rights and duties of neutrals , the exemption of private property at sea , not contraband of war  --  these ate matters never more pressing than at this moment . The new distinction between absolute and conditional contraband of war , and the inviolability of the official and private correspondence of neutrals , are fresh issues brought to the front by the activity of Russia 's cruisers . How great a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition would be Is apparent if we but consider the dangerous friction between Russia and England over the Red Sea seizures three months ago . A Washington dispatch to an Administration newspaper states that " a disagreeable impression " has been made upon she State Department by the news that the courts in Venezuela have decided against the New York and Bermudez Asphalt Company . This was the case in which the company was sued for having financed a revolution against the constituted Government . We believe it is not denied that the proof was absolutely conclusive , being largely documentary , and furnished by a former employee of the company . But the fact that our Government is displeased at the decision , is not the most significant thing in the dispatch . It goes on to say that " the State Department has always reserved the right to review the radicial proceedings in this celebrated case , and has already more than ? once indicated plainly that it did not regard the ' step taken in the asphalt controversy as legal . " There we have a fine illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister republics on this continent " as equals . He proposes to interpret their laws for them . Their judicial proceedings are to be reviewed and overriden by him . He is to be their court of final appeal . The very statement of ! his position is enough to condemn it . It may be explained as a mere bit of that arrogant contempt for Spanish Americans which Mr. Hay has unfortunately too little concealed , but in any case it is an attitude at once unjustifiable and provocative . Dr. Chandler , the anti-Addicks Republican who was nominated for Governor in Delaware , refuses to get off the tick . et in the interest of " harmony " so that the State may be carried for Addicks and Roosevelt . He declares that he enlisted against Addle:kis until the end of the war , and that , no matter if Others surrender , he wT11 fight to the last . The nomination came to him , he explains , without has seeking , and was accepted on the distinet condition that it should stand until the votes were counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piratical Addicks . To old-fashioned people this may seem an instanve of unbending virtue ; but the President 's favorite doctrine of " the practical " and " the larger good " tells heavily against it . Impracticable Dr. Chandler Should be made to understand that it is better for a dozen Delawares to be debauched by a dozen Addickses than for the party of purity and reform to fail to elect its President . Gov . Garvin of Rhode Island has offered a reward for the conviction of bribers , $150 each for the first five , and $50 each for the rest . He will not , it is safe to say , bankrupt the State , not because Rhode Island will be free from bribery on November 8 , but because the corrupters of that corrupt little commonwealth will , if we may judge the future by the past , be rich and powerful enough to escape punishment . The ring headed by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich has made the term popular government almost a mockery in that State ; it buys and sells legislation and offices with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Clark . The condition of affairs was briefly described by Gov . Garvin in a speech at Olneyville last week . " Rhode Island people , " he said , " are exploited by their Legislature . Their right to a just representation in the General Assembly , their right to an equal suffrage in the cities , their Constitutional right to have the three great departments of the State Government kept equal and apart , their right to a non-partisan judiciary , their right to a fair return from the granting of public franchises to private individuals , their right to the enactment of just laws without purchase  --  all these rights and many others are denied to the people of the State by the General Assembly . " This year the Republicans are so nervous over the outcome that they are spending money with unusual liberality ; and they have tried to strengthen the ticket by inducing Chief Justice John H. Stiness to run for Congress . The obvious purpose of this step is to divert attention from the disreputable ring to a respectable candidate . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The death of Mr. Van Cott gives President Roosevelt what should be a welcome opportunity to put the local post , office ' on a sound business basis . In many respects its management has been disgraceful . We refer not merely to the political activities of the late postmaster , but to the fact that the New York post-office is years-behind the great offices of Berlin and London . For this , Congress must , of course , share the responsibility , but every large business house in this city is " aware that in efficiency and promptness of delivery the New York service is sadly lacking . The handling of newspaper mails is especially open to criticism , and repeated complaints bring no satisfaction . If Mr. Roosevelt feels as he used to feel about the need of efficiency in such , an office , he - will appoint a man of the type of the late Mr. Henry G. Pearson , whose bust stands near the entrance of the post-office building . What is needed is not a political leader , whether his tendency be in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose standing will of itself give assurance that he will properly conduct this great office without regard to the affairs of any political party , and with the sole desire to make the postal service in this city the best possible . The subway opened last week adds to our habitable area territory- at least ten times the size of Manhattan Island itself . The bearing of this upon social conditions can hardly be overestimated . Our tenement system at its worst has its basis in unchecked human greed , and only curbing legislation such as the new tenement law can stop it . But its peculiarity is that it comprehends all classes except the very rich , so that private dwellings have ceased to be built on Manhattan Island , less than 100 going up last year With the new transit system , however , the man of moderate means will no longer be inevitably forced into five or six ridiculously high-priced and ill-ventilated rooms . At present , residential property within thirty minutes of the City Hall is valued at from $20,000 to $30,000 a lot ; the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time limit an abundance of lots valued at $1,000 , $2,000 , and $3,000 . Its effect is already illustrated in the movement of the Jewish population . Thousands of East Side families have moved up into the sections of Harlem penetrated by the new railroad . Great preparations are already under way to build up for their accommodation vast areas which have lain waste for years , but which are now brought within the hinterland of the subway . How a slight transit improvement impels the people from the fiat to the one-family house is evident from the great growth of South Brooklyn since the trolleys crossed the bridge . Living conditions on Manhattan are not to be radically changed , for nearly all the vacant land is occupied and its great growth in population will keep up land values . But the subway will enormously increase the residential area , and give the city elbow room . " Peace with honor " is Mr. Balfour'h phrase for the adjustment of the North Sea imbroglio , and only the most daunt less Chauvinists of the British press take any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Great Britain has not wrung a more summary satisfaCtion from Russia is to regret that war is averted , for the affair was of extreme difficulty . Probably it never could have been settled by direct negotiation . The point of honor was involved hopelessly . Russia could not have cashiered an admiral overnight , and yet English indignation would tolerate no delay . England could not have remained long in the anomalous position of impounding a friendly fleet . Something must have broken before even the preliminaries of an investigation and amends were effected . Precisely because the point of honor was definitely in question , the - reference of this controversy to a cpmmission appointed by the Hague Tribunal is of the highest historical moment . It extends the principle of deliberation and arbitration to a class of cases generally supposed to be too delicate to admit of such a disposition . Recall only that virtually all existing arbitration treaties have excepted matters of national honor from the compact , as if offences too outrageous to admit the intervention of an arbiter might arise ; as if , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of business , but degrading when more serious national issues were at stake . Fortunately , Mr. Balfour and the Tsar have taken no such short-sighted view . On what is the most delicate punctilio that could arise , they appeal to an impartial commission for the facts . Nothing could more effectually discredit the theory that arbitration will forever be but a halting and limited expedient . The reflections of the London Times - correspondent on the value of the Tibetan treaty fall as coldly as soda after wine . He reminds all concerned that the treaty was made by a provisional government , whose engagements the Tibetans may or may not honor ; in the name of a deposed sovereign , the Grand Lama , whom they venerate . It is recalled that the chief signatory , the Tashi-Lama , was being treated as a heretic and usurper while Lhasa lay under General Macdonald 's guns , that the position of the Amban will be untenable when the British withdraw . In short , the sig natories of the Tibetan treaty are precisely like the young clerks who serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference , however , that , in the case of Tibet , no principals may ever be found at all . The moral of the whole affair is that quite as sat isfactory a treaty could have been drawn and signed at Gyangtse or Calcutta . The march to Lhasa has been unproductive even of prestige , unless Mr. Balfour is willing to go the whole way and establish a crown colony on the roof of the world . In other words , Great Britain has been at infinite pains and expense to execute a formal instrument with a nation incapable of furnishing a bond . In the business world such incompetent parties are provided with guardians or let alone . Billow , when reproached with the numerous secret conventions into which Germany had entered , declared the Empire to be extraordinarily " treatyable . " Obviously this is not the case with Tibet . The real animus of the Younghusband mission appears in the retention of the Chumbi valley . The treaty Is merely a soothing application for the British conscience . Morally , Premier Combes was defeated on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army  --  a resolution absolutely without point unless the accusations against Gen. Andr ? were believed . Against such an expression of opinion a majority of four , on a vote of confidence , is of little weight . It is too early to know whether there is any foundation for the charges that Gen. Andre uses the army for partisan purposes and conducts an odious system of spying upon his officers . The character of the man makes it seem unlikely that such practices , if they exist , have his countenance . But the readiness with which M. Combes 's normal majority of about eighty has melted away , shows the essential weakness of his position . On all anti-clerical measures he is strong ; on all others most vulnerable . No Government of recent years has rested on so narrow a base . Friday 's mishap , then , will presumably fix the Premier in his resolvE to concentrate upon the abolition of the Concordat  --  the only issue upon which he can surely rally the discordant elements of his composite majority . Premier Combes 's bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly moderate . It allows an interval for the parishes to provide for self-support , promises to the priests a pittance of 400 francs annually for four years after the separation , as well as pensions for the high dignitaries of the Church now in service . Nothing about the change will be abrupt except the abolishing of the embassy at the Vatican . Considered broadly , the measure seems almost conciliatory , and unexpectedly regardful of the historic relations between France and the Holy See . It shows a very - different spirit from the wholesale proscription which M Combes visited upon the recalcitrant religious orders . In judging a measure of this importance , several questions arise : Is. the policy desirable in itself ? Are the means taken to secure it fair and honorable ? Is it expedient ? On all scores except expediency , much is to be said for Premier Comb es 's project of separation . The ideal for all nations is a free Church in a free State , but it is politically doubtful if at the present time France would be better off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pope is at liberty to send Ultramontane bishops who could fill the parishes of every Department with scheming , disloyal priests , of which a natural consequence would be the formation of a Clerical party that might become formidable , and in any case would present a constant embarrassment to the Republic compared with which the Clerical perils imagined by M. . Combes are so many phantoms . Some inkling of this danger he clearly has , since his bill provides for the continuation of the Ministry of Cults , a portfolio which , after the complete separation of Church and State , would seem as superfluous as a sixth toe Evidently the Premier contemplates some ill-defined jurisdiction over the Church through such a ministry . The London Times has discovered an interesting letter written by Li Hung Chang , a few weeks before his death in 1901 , to Yung-lu , at that time one of the most influential of the Empress-Dowager 's advisers . The Russian Government was then urging China to agree to a convention making the de facto situation in Mantchuria permanent Li Hung Chang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and advanced some reasons why the Empress-Dowager should agree , which now sound very much as if he had had an insight into the future . If , he said , Russia was left in possession of Mantchuria , no serious harm would ensue , for in that event friction would certainly arise between Russia and Japan on the frontiers of Korea , and an actual conflict would be inevitable . To his own country he assigned the ignoble part of siding with the victor . Should the Japanese win , the proper policy for the Chinese , in Li Hung Chang 's opinion , would be to join them in driving the Russians out of Mantchuria . In the other event , China should win Russia 's gratitude and receive back Mantchuria by giving Korea to the Czar , and by aiding in the complete overthrow of the Japanese . Thus he felt certain that , either way , China would regain Mantchuria  --  a belief hardly to be shared by unbiassed observers of the Russian tenacity in holding on to any territory once acquired . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China as clearly as in Japan , and this makes the Russian blindness to impending events all the more astonishing .
