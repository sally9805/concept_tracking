txt Sighted at 10 o'Clock Yesterday Only Seventy-five Miles Out , but Going Fast Headed East . The German schooner Hambuig was leading the ocean race for the Kabler 's Cup early yesterday morning . She was then 130 miles out , heading northeast , making apparently for the Nantucket Lightship . A mile and a half behind her was the Atlantic on the same tack and footing at a good rate . Both boats were Crowding on all the sail they could handle close hauled , and were beating against the fifteen-knot breeze blowing from the northeast . E. C. Benedict , on his steam yacht , the Oneida , fololwed the racers all of Wednesday , and left them early yesterday morning . It was foggy , and the haze was thickening fast . When he turned back he could make little of the two boats . He turned back at dawn , and while returning saw no signs of the other racers until at 10 o'clock yesterday morning he met the Ailsa seventyfive miles out heading east . He was not able to learn what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making good headway , and to be driving hard to make up lost ground . The other vessels in the fleet scattered early in the race , and are probably pursuing widely divergent courses . The Oneida returned to Greenwich and was berthed at 11 o'clock last night at Indian Harbor . The party aboard her went to the Benedict place for the night . In the time elapsed from the ' start of the race until the Oneida lost the two boats in the fog they had made good progress , footing fast all the way . Both boats were admirably handled and took advantage of every possible point . The showing made by the Hamburg was a big surprise to those watching her . While it was known she was speedy , it was not thought she would pass the Atlantic in that kind of work . The impression left by her splendid work was that the Marshall boat would have all it could do to beat her on an even basis . If the two have equal luck with the weather they will furnish as pretty a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on the choice of a course . Both are likely to go well to north , chancels ' danger to the limit of reasonable safety , hoping to get strong winds in the northern circle . The Ailsa 's showing is most puzzling . rh at she had only : ) roceeded seventy-five - miles in twenty-two hours-under. : conditions peculiarly favorable to her is most surprising . Some mishap must have occurred to account for her poor showing . Whatever the accident was it is unquestioningly remedied , for no sign of disability was apparent to the Benedict party . It will be regretted by her wellwishers that she has lost the opportunity offered by weather to which she is better adapted than any other of the boats in the fleet . What courses the other boats are pro , ceeding upon is a question . It is doubtful Ilf the square riggers , in the face of conditions existing all afternoon and night could have reached Nantucket in any case until late in the day . A dense fog prevailed all morning about the shoal light , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there without being seen . That all passed that way is by no means certain . Shortly after noon the northeast winds that had been blowing from the start freshened and shifted . From fourteen miles an hour they increased to eighteen ' and then to twenty . The direction of the wind altered to north and then northwest . This would give the square-riggers a chance to make up some of their lost ground . It will take southwesterly winds to put them on anything like favorable equal grounds with the fore and aftersi until they pass the Banks , so that it is probable they are still miles astern the leaders at this hour . There is no hope of any further information of the positions of the boats I until they are heard from on ocean liners incoming . Even then their relative post- ' tions can not be determined unless the extremely unlikely circumstance should occur that a liner should meet more than one boat . All that such a report could tell would be the position of one yacht at a given time , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some idea of the progress she was making , but even this would show nothing of the place she held in the advance of the fleet . From this time on , therefore , it is likely that no definite news , giving an idea of the outcome of the race , will be received until the first boat is sighted off the Lizard.
