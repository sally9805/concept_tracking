txt We have not the slightest desire to ? , underestimate the sincerity of the pubspirit of those who are opposing the Brough bill to regulate the sale of liquor in this city . The feature that attracts the greatest and the most ear -- nest opposition is the provision that does away with the secret sale of liquor - on the Sabbath and - substitutes legal sale within limited hours and subject to rigid restrictions calculated to abolish the evils and scandals now prevalent This opposition is based on respect for the Christian Sabbath in part , and in part on objection to the sale of liquor on the one day of rest It is claimed that any sale of liquor on Sunday is contrary to the wish and condemned by the judgment of a majority of the dwellers in the city . There is no proof of this . The obvious facts are inconsistent with the statement Nearly all the large foreign population of the city , ' the population wholly or in part of foreign parentage , which was some 2,600,000 in 1900 , and a considerable part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice against the sale of liquor under reason ' able restraint . So far as the democratic principle of the sentiment of the majority prevails , there is little reason to doubt that the Brough bill would be approved . But apart from that principle , the alternative presented to the sincere respecters of the Sabbath is not actual suppression of the traffic . No such suppression has ever been accomplished for more than a short time , and not completely then . The secret , Illegal sale of liquor goes on Sunday after Sunday . It is accompanied by revolting evils in many cases . The back rooms of the ordinary saloons and the premises of most of the so-called " hotels , " established primarily to secure a liquor license , are notoriously given over to promoting the most corrupting vice . To this the Brough bill would put a stop . The back room would be done away with , the vicious hotel made unprofitable . That , it seems to us , is well worth the concession of such Sunday sales as are permitted by the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible the varied evils now connected with Sunday selling .
