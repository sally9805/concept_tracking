txt English Vessel 's Captain Detected Attempt at Violation and Refused to Bring Them  --  Our Consul Willing . Upon the arrival of the Royal Mail s ? Steam Packet Company 's steamer Trent from Colon yesterday it became known that an attempt bad been made in behalf of railroad labor contractors of St. Louis to smuggle into the United States hundreds of contract laborers from the Pane= Canal who were dissatisfied with Conditions on the Isthiinis . ' The attempt was defeated by the vigilance of the English Captain of the steamer Trent , T. R. Pierce , who seemed to 132X e more knowledge of our alien contract labor laws than the American Consul at Colon . The Consul , according to the Captain of the Trent , was willing to permit the men to embark for the United States . It la not contended , however , that the Consul was aware that the men were tinder contract to come to this country . Incidentally , while it developed that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction among the laborers on the Isthmus and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government is determined to keep all the men it possibly can who have come to work on the canal . The demand for labor everywhere is so keen that labor agents have little trouble la inducing the men to quit with promises of better conditions elsewhere . Planned to Send Hundreds of Aliens . It seems that the Italian agent at Colon of the contractors booked seventy secondclass passages from Colon to New York on the Trent at the rate of $40 Der head , and said that if the company would take them he was prepared to send from seventy to 150 men by each of the company 's steamers which leave Colon fortnightly for this port . ' When Capt . Pierce of the Trent was told by Parker , the steamship agent , that Seventy Greeks , Turks , and Armenians had been booked as second class passengers for New York ' be remembered the United-States contract - labor laws and became suspicious . His doubts were confirmed after questioning one of the men who spoke English , and he refused to take them on board at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian labor agent asked him if he would take the men as far as Kingston , Jamaica . The Captain agreed to that proposition , and carried the fifty-five of them to Jamaica as deck passengers , where they landed to watt for a chance to get up by one of the fruit steamers to New York or Boston . Capt . Pierce said yesterday : " My suspicions were aroused directly our agent . Mr. Parker , told me that such a large body of men who could not speak 1:riglish had booked in the second cabin for New York . I said that I could not accept them until I had gone thoroughly into the matter . The man who wanted to ship these laborers was an Italian living in Colon , whose name I have forgotten , as I only saw him on two occasions . He assured me that the men were perfectly clean and respectable in their habits , as he thought that I might object to carrying Greeks or Turks on my ship , and had forty of them lined up for my inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The men were a fine , healthy looking lot , and were all shaved and well dressed . The majority appeared to be Greeks , and the remainder Turks and Armenians . After I had taken a good look at them I sang out : ' Is there any man here that can speak English ? ' One man replied : ' I can , Sir , ' and I questioned him . He said he was a Greek . who had been working ' on the canal and wanted to go to America . " ' Are all these men with you ? ' I asked . " ' Yes , Sir . ' " ' Where are you going ? ' " ' To St. Louis . ' " ' What for ? ' " ' To work on a railroad . ' " ' Have you got a. contract ? ' " ' No , Sir , but we have a letter . ' " I said : ' That is enough for me . You do not come on my ship . ' " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men he swore that they were not under contract in the United States , but were simply going up there to look for work , and the Greek who spoke English came up to me again and said that I had misunderstood him about having a letter for all the men . He meant to tell me , he said , that the letter to the St. Louis railroad padrone only was intended for himself and two friends , but I waived him away and refused to discuss , the matter further . My decision was final . " Parker , our agent , was ' disappointed at my refusal to take the men , as it ? meant a loss of $2,800 to the company , so I went with him to see James C. Kellogg , the American Consul in Colon . We put the matter before him , and he said : ' Well , Captain . I do not see anything against your carrying these passengers , as they are respectable workingmen . ' " When I questioned him about the labor laws he did not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consular documents , and r discovered that . I was liable to have the ship fined $1,000 per head for each contract man I carried to New York , and for doing it with my eyes open in a tact. : like this I stood to get six months ' imprisonment . - I agreed finally to take to Jamaica fifty-five of the men who had $110 each . They landed there last Friday . After our - arrival there they begged me to let them come on to New York . I Instructed our agent there not to book any second-class passengers who had Greek , Turkish , or Armenian nanes . ' ' ' , Labor Unrest at the istimina . When asked about the labor conditions ' on the Isthmus , Capt . Pierce said that he not know exactly , what the trouble Contlaueil on , Page 2 . PLOT TO IMPORT PANAMA LABORERS // was down there , but a great deal of dirtsatisfication certainly- did exist . At the present ' time there were reported to be 14,000 Greeks , Armenians , . and Bulgarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Louis railroad , contractors , knowing of this dissatisfaction , had gone to them and offered better terms . for their labor on the Western railroads . " Spaniards are being shipped from VI. : go In great numbers to the Isthmus , " said Capt . Pierce . " We carted 150 this trip , and our- steamer , the Severn , was chartered by the Canal Commission to bring TOO men froth Cuba , but Sir William Van Horn and the chief employers of labor there made such a protest that we had to get away quickly ? with only 120 instead of the full complement . " Capt . Pierce was asked if in his opinion the laborers who- wanted to come to New York on the Trent had broken their contracts with the canal company . " Well , that I can not answer , ' he replied . " That may have finished them , because I heard that a big batch of Spanish imported laborers had refused duty and tried to get away on the French steamer , but were marched back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bayonet . The American Government is being put to great expense In order to import labor for the canal from all parts of Europe , and It is hardly likely that they will allow their men to be enticed away until their contract has been completed . " Immigration Commissioner Watchorn , at Ellis Island , was much interested yester ? day when a TIMES reporter told him of the attempt to get contract laborers into the United States from the Isthmus . He said : This is the first I have heard of the matter since I received instructions from the Department of Commerce and Labor atk Washington to have a strict watch kept on all vessels coming up from Panama . No laborers have come into this port from Panama so far . Pays IMO Per Head for Workers . " I presume this St. Louis agency Is the same organization in St. Louis that has been sending agents to Bulgaria , Bosnia , and Roumania recently to get labor and paying $S0 bonus per head . Since May we have deported 344 Bulgarians alone who came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of money . " Failing in their attempt to get labor from Eastern Europe , I suppose they have turned their attention to the Isthmus and sent down their agents to round up the dissatisfied laborers and ship them to this country . No doubt the Idea of paying the secondclass fare was to get the men in easier than if they had been sent steerage , but they will find out their mistake . Capt . Pierce did quite right in refusing to allow these Greeks and Turks to come on his ship . If he had carried them there would have been trouble for him and the owners of the steamer . These fifty-five men who have been dumped at Kingston , Jamaica , by the Trent will try to get up here-on some of the fruit steamers , and I will have a strict watch kept to see that they are brought to Ellis Island . " The scarcity of labor in the West Is responsible for these expensive attempts to import contract labor for the railroads . We discovered yesterday a leak of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baltic , and intend to stop it . The Lituania , which left for Libau yesterday , brought in three stowaways from Russia , who were ordered to be deported , but they escaped from the steamer and she sailed without them . " Commissioner Watchorn issued instructions to boarding officers to search all steamers arriving from the West Indies . whether they carried passengers or not . " Do not be satisfied with asking , " he said , " but see for yourselves that there are none of these Greeks , Turks , Armenians , or any other laborers on board . and bring all the steerage passengers to Ellis Island . " These instructions will be in the official orders at Ellis Island to-1 day . The steamer Trent sails to-day at 3 P.1 M , for Colon , via Kingston . with loo passengers . Capt . Pierce is one of the senior commanders in the company and was in charge of the Orinoco when she collided with the Kaiser Wilhelm off Cherbourg last Fall . The verdict was in his favor .

Deputy O'Keeffe Says He 's Tried in Vain to Close Rockaway Places . When interviewed yesterday afternoon concerning a story to the effect that Commissioner Bingham had instituted an investigation into the truth of the charge that gambling houses are permitted to run without molestation by the police at Arverno and Far Rockaway , Deputy Police Commissioner O'Keeffe stated that he was being treated unjustly in the matter by the press .
