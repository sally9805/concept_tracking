 | ALMOST every mail brings to me from all sorts of sources ? indi viduals , financial institutions , newspapers , etc. ? the question , in sundry forms : " What effect is the so-called Steamship Merger likely to have upon the future of shipbuilding in this country ? " It is impracticable to answer all these inquiries separately ; and therefore it has occurred to me that the best way would be to reply to them in bulk , through an article accessible to everybody . I am not familiar with the detailed plans of the new organization of steamship lines , and my views of it are necessarily based , therefore , upon such information as has been already to a great extent laid before the reading public . I assume , however , that generally or in outline the impressions which the public has derived from what has been printed , either by authority or otherwise , are correct ; and I see in the situation no cause for alarm either to the American ship-builder or ship-owner or to the people in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , provided our Government will take adequate measures to meet the policy already operating in Germany and Great Britain . I am sure that it is not the intention of those who control or are to control the merged lines to raise materially the prices of ocean freights either way . Their object is rather to maintain a uniform rate or schedule of rates , and to add to their profits by the general reduction of operating expenses ; also to prevent the ruinous rate wars which have occurred under the old regime . If they can establish and maintain a uniform schedule of rates upon which shippers may confidently rely for a long time in advance , they will confer a substantial benefit upon the commercial public .  | Coming now to consider its effect upon shipbuilding in this country , I may say that it is commonly reported and generally believed that part of the arrangement under which the merger has been formed is an agreement that all of the new vessels to be built abroad from time to time for the combination shall be constructed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the management of the famous British architect , Mr. Pirrie . Such an agreement or understanding is a proper thing in such premises . The Belfast ship-yard is among the first of the best foreign yards , and vessels built in a single yard and under the same management must be more nearly homogeneous in design and structure , and better in all respects , than they would be if constructed promiscuously in all sorts of ship-yards and by people of varied capabilities . The Belfast concern , however , extensive as it may be in plant and organization , would hardly be able to keep up , at the highest standard of efficiency , the number of ships that the great new merger will need . The agreement with the Belfast concern , therefore , will by no means prevent the management of the merger from building some of their ships in the United States , if a section of the management is to be , as it ought to be , American , and if our Government will enact legislation which will enable any American to build and operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags . But , even apart from this consideration , it can easily be shown , or must logically appear , that it would be of the greatest importance to the success of the new company to stimulate energy and ingenuity abroad by building American ships , whose performance and quality would be put in competition or in comparison with those built abroad . I have no doubt that some sort of an American section , or department , or subordinate company , will be maintained in the organization of the merger . This is a natural supposition , because the American traveller is a most important factor in the patronage of steamship lines , and many , if not most , Americans prefer , all other things being equal , to patronize vessels of their own nationality rather than those built abroad . The question involved is , from one important point of view , historical ; that is to say , it can not be clearly understood nor can the causes which brought it about be distinctly measured without reverting to certain incidents in the history of transatlantic construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | The supremacy in the ocean-carrying trade which Great Britain had begun to attain at the outbreak of our Civil War , and which was made overwhelming during that war and for eight or ten years afterwards , was really the result of the stimulus given to her energies and her apprehensions by the organization of the American Collins Line . This line , some years before the outbreak of the Civil War , revolutionized the ocean steam-transit of that day . It was the result of a policy of assistance or subvention by our Government . The English had already adopted that policy and had applied it principally , so far as American trade was concerned , to the line founded by the late Samuel Cunard . When the Collins Line was put on , the British were thoroughly alarmed and , it might be said , stampeded . Their Government increased the subsidy of the Cunard Line to an extent which enabled Mr. Cunard to add to his fleet of four ships already built at the rate of another and a better ship each year . Our Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got into a quarrel over the subsidy question which resulted in the withdrawal of its assistance from the Collins Line , and in consequence that line collapsed , leaving not even a vestige of its existence . The British , however , continued to build new ships and establish new companies , although little , if any , advance was made in the type of ships they built or in their performance . However , as they had no competition on the part of the Americans , and as the Continental steamship lines were either not extant or in very feeble embryo at that time , the British were not compelled to improve upon the quality or performance of their ships ; but they went on making their own freight and passenger rates and , in general , commanding all the trade and all its benefits , including the extremely important one of controlling the markets which they supplied . Things remained in this condition until 1870-1871 , when . the announcement was made that an American Company had been formed with the intention of building four ships , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . These ships were built by the Cramps and were known as the " Pennsylvania , " " Ohio , " " Indiana " and " Illinois . " The prime requirement of these vessels was that they were to beat the British " City of Brussels , " then the crack Atlantic greyhound in the British fleet . This was the beginning of the second era , and we had precipitated another panic upon our British  | friends . Every one of the principal British companies then existing started at least two new ships , each of larger dimensions , of greater passenger accommodations and of higher speed than the four American ships . They also re-cast their subsidy system , so as to make it much more effective than it had been before . Among their expedients in this direction was the Naval Reserve Subvention , the operation of which is well known . In the mean time our Government did nothing for the new American line . Its ships , however , struggled along ; they were extremely popular , notwithstanding the efforts of the British to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for their day , they were exceedingly comfortable , stanch and safe seaboats . Part of their economy of performance was due to the use of compound-engines , which had been recently introduced at that time . This type of machinery was adopted also by the White Star Company in its first ship , the old " Oceanic , " and in the National Line steamer " Italy . " But while our Government neglected the American Line , the British Government continued to promote and foster its lines until the company that had built the four American ships was forced to the wall . The four ships were sold to the Red Star Line , a new American Company that had been started after having received a subsidy from the Belgian Government . These Red Star ships were sailing under the Belgian flag but their ownership was American . The substantial aid given this Company by the Belgian Government gave it a start and enabled it to add some American ships to its line ? and its owners were willing to struggle along with them and take chances for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to overcome the disabilities that their American ships would be subjected to by reason of greater continuous operating cost due to higher wages , more costly supplies , etc . No further building was done here , and the American ships were so far outclassed in size and speed by the subsidized British ships that they ceased to be a menace to British supremacy , and the characteristic self-complacency of the English once more re-asserted itself . It might be worth while to speculate what the result would have been if our Government had emulated , in respect to the Collins Line , what the British Government did for Cunard . If the United States Government had aided the Collins Company to an extent  | that would have enabled it to build a new ship each year , does any one suppose that , under such circumstances , the Collins Line would have gone to pieces , or that the Cunard or the other British lines that speedily followed would have so easily gained the unquestioned supremacy they did gain ? Or would it be unprofitable to speculate what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had emulated the policy towards it that the British Government immediately inaugurated towards its own steamship lines in order to enable them to crush their American rival ? I will not attempt to answer these questions ; but they ought to be food for reflection . Fruitless as these experiments turned out to be , so far as the development of the American merchant marine was concerned , their operations and the policy which they forced the British Government to adopt and pursue left an indelible impress upon the management of the ocean merchant marine of Great Britain . From the time that the American Line of 1871-2 passed out of the lists of serious competition , the British monopoly grew year by year until its unquestioned supremacy was fully recognized . This brings us down to the latter part of the seventies ? say , about 1877 . At this time , the competition of the French and German lines was not sufficient to disturb the British monopoly . The English went on from that time increasing the size and speed of their transatlantic passenger ships , and turning out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " tramps " ; but the improvements they made in ocean liners were not commensurate with the rapidly increasing demands of the travelling public . As for the freight ships , no improvement was attempted in them at all during this period . On the contrary , as has been wittily said of the tramp ships in those days : " The English built them by the mile and cut them off in lengths to suit . " As I have often said elsewhere , it is a rule in human affairs that neither a man nor a nation can stand still ; if they do not go ahead they must retrograde ; and , with exceptions not worth mentioning here , the British stopped and stood still in the matter of steamship development several years ago . To discuss the causes of this supineness in detail would take too much space ; but it may be said that the first great palpable evidence of the decline of British supremacy in the ocean-carrying trade appeared when they  | took up such an immense quantity of tonnage for transport service at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the stress of this emergency the decline became more obvious than it had seemed under normal conditions ; but , while the British were standing still and therefore retrograding , the Germans went ahead with giant strides . Up to about 1887 , while the two great German lines had from time to time increased their fleets to some extent , they had bought all their first-class ships in England or had had them built in English yards , and they had made little or no effort to develop a shipbuilding industry of their own on a large scale . As early as 1887 , however , they had laid down two first-class ships in their own yards , these vessels being simply imitations of the British models they already possessed . The real development of German shipbuilding on a great modern scale began with the accession of the present Emperor in 1888 . That enterprising monarch from his earliest manhood had evinced a strong predilection for commercial and . business pursuits , and his special ambition was directed to the extension of Germany 's foreign commerce . He at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ships can permanently hold first rank in the ocean-carrying trade ; and , from that moment until the present time , he has bent all the energies of his nature and all the power of his exalted position to the promotion of German shipbuilding and of the foreign commerce of his Empire . The result of this strong and well defined policy was soon apparent . The Germans not only began to build their own ships , but also began to build better ships than they could buy in Great Britain . I have heard an interesting anecdote in connection with this branch of the subject . In the Fall of 1887 , an American gentleman connected with the shipbuilding industry here was a homeward-bound passenger on the " Trave " of the North German Lloyd Line . Among his fellow-passengers was the eminent English architect , Mr. William John , the designer of our ship of war , the " Texas , " and he was on his way to this country to aid in developing his plans , which had been purchased by Secretary Whitney . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for a little speech ; and he chose for his subject the comfort and other good qualities of the German Line . In the course of his remarks ,  | he made some comparisons between the management of the British and German lines , not altogether favorable to the former . To this Mr. William John in his turn responded . Among other things , he said that Germany had a respectable merchant marine , while the United States had none at all or none worth speaking of . The cause of it was that the German Government permitted its citizens to buy their ships where they could get them built most economically , but that the American Government would not permit its citizens to place a foreign-built ship under their own flag . He then proceeded to say that in this the Germans displayed sound business sense . Realizing that they could never excel in shipbuilding or that Germany could never become a great shipbuilding nation , they adopted the next best expedient and supplied their lines with British-built ships . To this , the Captain of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it was true that the Germans had previously bought all their firstclass ships in England , of which the good ship then under their feet was an example , they had prepared and would soon launch forth a great scheme of home-shipbuilding . " I venture to prophesy , " said the Captain of the " Trave , " " that , within ten or twelve years from this time , you will see in the service of the North German Lloyd Company a passenger steamship or ocean greyhound that will excel in size , comfort , safety , speed and all other desirable qualities , any ship ever built in Great Britain or to be built there . " The English naval architect smiled at this ; but , of course , politeness restrained him from further comment . This was in the Fall of 1887 . Ten years from that time , the North German Lloyd Company put on its line the " Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse , " a ship which the English have not thus far succeeded in equalling , much less in excelling . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present time . Their effects were very greatly accentuated when the English withdrew such a large amount of tonnage for the uses of the South-African War , and the Germans made haste to take up in all directions the traffic that the British had in that manner wholly or partly abandoned . The result is that Germany has practically taken the first place in the oceancarrying trade , and Great Britain has been relegated to the second place . Of course , there is a great deal more British tonnage than German tonnage , but the German ships are nearly all of modern  | types , many of them new and in the total average superior in capacity and performance to the total average of British tonnage in the ratio of more than two to one . This marked the third great era in the history of the British merchant marine . Something had to be done ; but the British did not seem capable of developing any scheme or enterprise that might avail to restore their waning fortunes . At this moment , certain American steamship men , perceiving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having obtained assistance to American shipping from our own Government , saw that there was an opportunity for heroic treatment , and they secured the assistance of Mr. Morgan in a scheme to Americanize in fact , if not in name , a very large amount of hitherto foreign ocean steam-tonnage . This , however , was only the beginning of what has since occurred . The so-called merger as it stands , though not of British conception or British origin , may prove the salvation of the British merchant marine . The English were helpless in the matter , because they apparently had no mind or personality of their own capable of organizing it . But it has aroused the British public from the lethargy of years ' duration and has turned their normal self-complacency into an almost feverish realization of the actual conditions which confront them . This was the reason why certain English steamship lines so readily and so gladly fell in with the plans of Mr. Morgan and his associates in the merger . The British newspapers and other organs of public expression took great alarm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their downfall . The greatest British newspaper coined the term " Morganeering " as a descriptive epithet . Still , the common-sense left in England even on this most delicate of subjects , has been strongly and ably voiced by Lord Brassey at the annual meeting of the London Chamber of Coinmerce , of which he is President . This meeting occurred on May 28th last , and it was so numerously attended that the room in which the annual meeting has been held from time immemorial could not accommodate the crowd , so that it had to be adjourned to a more spacious place . In the course of his presidential address , Lord Brassey said that it was idle for the British to expect or claim a monopoly of the North Atlantic ; it  | was certain that , sooner or later , some movement similar to that initiated by Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan would be brought about by the United States . He then proceeded as follows : " Let us not lose our national dignity in unavailing and groundless alarms . Our position as a maritime nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all corners because we build ships more cheaply and , with or without foreign crews , sail them more cheaply than any of our rivals . " Lord Brassey admitted , however , that the British shipbuilders must look to their laurels in the construction of ocean steamships of the type of the Hamburg-American line steamer " Deutschland , " and he urged more liberal subsidies for mail-carrying . In a session of the House of Commons the same night , the shipping question was again brought up on the motion for the reappointment of the Committee on Ships ' Subsidies , and discussion of this motion elicited expressions of opinion from all parts of the House that it was desirable to enlarge the scope of the Committee , so as to enable it to report upon the latest developments in the ocean-carrying trade , and there was general assent to a proposition that an important increase of subsidies for mailcarrying and for other purposes was imperative . That the English have been thoroughly roused from their lethargy , and that their traditional self-complacency has given place to an almost morbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 5th of June . This information is to the effect , that the Cunard Line will not only not come into the American merger , but that powerful interests in Great Britain have determined to use it with the Elder-Dempster , the Canadian Pacific Steamship connections and other lines , as a basis of what may , and probably will , result in a great English merger , organized on lines somewhat similar to the one already effected . If this determination is carried out , it will be to the general advantage of the commercial and shipping world at large , because it will have the effect of preventing a universal merger of all the great lines . Whether such a universal merger was contemplated , as the probable or even possible outcome of Mr. Morgan 's plans , there are no means of knowing . It would have been extremely difficult to bring all the great steamship lines under several different hags into a great and all-embracing combine . There would have been  | financial difficulties , though these might not have been so nearly insuperable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point of view , it is to be hoped that the English will carry into effect their evident purpose to use the Cunard Line as the basis of a great merger that shall be purely British in finance and in management . It is really the only expedient now left open to them , if they are to retain , not the absolute supremacy they once had , but at best a share of it more or less relatively important . Manifestly , the power and resources of the Morgan American merger can be adequately met only by a combination equal in financial strength and material equipment . It could not be met by isolated companies , operating separately . But it must be borne in mind that this great British merger will be backed by all the resources of the British Government , and therefore it must become a menace to our shipping interests in the absence of action on the part of our Government to meet it . Having thus shown the conditions which existed in ship-owning and the effect which the merger is likely to have upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect upon shipbuilding . In the first place , it is bound to stimulate or , a better phrase would be , to compel a very marked advance in the type and character of British-built ships , and it must also , for reasons which I suggested early in this paper , beneficially affect American shipbuilding , particularly in ship-yards which represent a high state of modern development in plant , appliances , methods and organization . At this time American rivalry is a subject that has awakened the interest of the British more than at any other period in history . The reason why first-class American shipbuilders and their capacities should be considered by the merger is , that it must stimulate all parties to the development of vessels of greater speed , greater comfort and greater relative economy in fuel consumption and in other elements of operating cost . The sudden augmentation in the size of merchant ships has revolutionized all the methods of work and of manipulating the various materials of construction . Man-handling of the materials that enter into the make-up of the mammoth ships now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powerful and newly  | designed machinery , together with increased yard-space , is imperatively demanded to handle , fashion and work into place the elements of these immense structures . At this point in order to illustrate my meaning by a practical object lesson it becomes necessary for me to refer briefly to the establishment under my own control . Radical and sweeping changes have been made , amounting to a complete revolution of plant , methods and working organism . These changes are now complete ; but they have been made so quietly and with so little self-advertisement that the importance and significance of the progress achieved has but just begun to be suspected , and is hardly yet realized by the trade at large , or even by those who should be interested in it above all others . The ship-yard with its miles of railroad tracks of standard gauge , and with its locomotives , travelling locomotive cranes , and freight cars able to load and unload at every point necessary for receiving plates , etc. , and for their trans-shipment to the localities where they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great work in the New Departure ; the electric overhead travelling cranes and their appliances for giving the highest effectiveness to its power , plant , etc. , as a second section ; and as a third section , the great air-power plant with its riveting , drilling , chipping and caulking appliances , making Cramp 's the foremost ship-yard on the planet in its preparations for the New Departure . Difficulties experienced by the builders of large ships abroad have compelled their appreciation of the gravity of the situation there , and they have just discovered the great strides that the Cramp Company has made in providing for the future . The present result is that that company is in continuous correspondence with the foremost shipbuilders in Great Britain ( some of whom have already visited the works ) , who have recently organized a committee of their most prominent men to visit the company 's yard for the purpose of personally investigating the design , construction and operations of the new system . As an instance of this attentiveness we may quote briefly from " Engineearing " of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We refer to the use of pneumatic tools in the construction of the hulls of ships . The wonderful adaptability of these tools to the many and varying operations necessary in the construction of the steel framing and plating of vessels , whether it be for drilling , riveting , caulking ,  | or chipping , can not long be overlooked . Let us see what others are doing in the matter . The Americans , who so often seem to look ahead of us , appear to have done so again with regard to this question , and have in consequence gained experience in the use of pneumatic tools for shipwork which we have yet to acquire . " Take , for instance , the works of Messrs . Cramp , of Philadelphia , where these tools have been adopted throughout the shipbuilding yards , and are employed on the very heaviest work . During last year , a part of the work carried out there was the construction of two steamers for the American Line . The length of these steamers is 560 ft. , and the registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship is approximately 647,000 , and their dimensions are as follows ; In the shear strake , 1 1/8 in. in diameter ; in bottom strake , 1 in. in diameter ; and in the general work 7/8 in. in diameter Practically , the whole of the riveting on the above ships was done by pneumatic tools The actual cost of the riveting , as compared to handwork , was 40 per cent . less The aggregate capacity of the air compressors in the above works is 15,000 cubic feet of free air per minute , compressed to 100 lb. per square inch At present , the pneumatic riveters at work at Southampton Dock are being operated by men who have come over from Messrs . Cramp and Co. ' s works , until the English workmen get accustomed to their use . " The foreman and the men referred to as being at Southampton have recently returned to this country , having perfected successfully the work they were sent over to do . Their presence in Southampton was a notable event in the shipbuilding world of Europe , and visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These visitors came not only from British yards but also from the Continent . A newspaper cable despatch of a few days ago announcing the intention of the Chief Constructor of the German Navy to visit Cramp 's ship-yard for the purpose of examining into the new system , indicates the widespread influence that Cramp 's New Departure has had upon the shipbuilding art in the world at large .
