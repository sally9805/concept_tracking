 | LITTLE DUCK ISLAND , nine 4 miles south of Northeast Harbor , Mount Desert Island , Maine , is the nesting place for three species of sea birds ? the herring gull , the black guillemot , or sea pigeon , and the Leach 's petrel , also called white-rumped or forked-tailed petrel . This island is about half a mile long and a third of a mile wide , partly covered with scrub pines , underbrush , and wild raspberry bushes . Although its shores are very rocky , the interior is fairly well covered with soil , which is , however , not deep , as rocky ridges are to be seen in all directions . Among the birds above mentioned , the herring gulls , whose rookery is well known and who nest there from May until August , are to be seen by the thousand . I doubt if it is generally known that the petrel lives there at all , though , as a matter of fact , I think I am conservative in saying that ten petrels nest on the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the daytime for the purpose of seeing the gulls , one would never know from any outward sign that the petrel is in point of numbers the chief inhabitant . I have visited Little Duck Island a number of times , and studied the burrows of the petrel , which are found there in large numbers . These burrows or  | tunnels are found in the banks and on the ground or under rocks all over the island . The petrels are especially fond of making them among the raspberry bushes , probably because of the fact that the ground is softer there , and consequently easier to tunnel . The tunnels are from IS to 24 inches in length , with at least one turn , and descend at an angle of about 30 degrees . At the end the tunnel is slightly enlarged or scooped out , and a few straws and blades of grass gathered in a little heap constitute the nest on which the bird lays its one egg . This egg is about one and a quarter inches in length , white , with small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fragile . One of the birds is always on the nest during the day , while its mate is far out at sea . I say far out , as the petrel is very rarely seen near the coast . Some ornithologists have stated that the male bird usually sits on the nest during the day . While I am not in a position actually to disprove this , I doubt if it is the rule , my belief being founded upon recent observations , when spending the night among the petrels watching their nocturnal habits as they return from sea . Their burrows or tunnels will just admit the hand and arm , and if one has a fairly long reach one can withdraw the sitting bird from the nest . They are comparatively tame , although , as a means of defense against any intruder in their nest , they will emit from the mouth about a teaspoonful of a reddish-brown fluid , which is most pungent and of a strong musky odor . When brought into the light the birds seem to be somewhat blinded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerately ; but they shortly become used to the change , and will work their way clear of the long grass and other obstructions until their wings are free , when they take to flight . On the  | ground they are most awkward , their very long wings , together with their webbed feet , interfering with their progress . The night that I spent on the island gave me a better opportunity of watching the habits of this bird than I could have obtained in any other way . About dusk I walked to a certain spot where I knew there was a large number of their burrows , and sat down on a rock to await their return from sea . There were burrows within four feet of where I sat , and I speculated with much interest as to what effect my close proximity would have on the occupants when their mates returned . About this time hundreds of gulls were returning to the island for the night , and before me , sitting on the rocks and flying in the air , were thousands of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying . As soon as night settled down , they in turn found roosting places on the rocks near the shore , and their cries became more and more faint , until at last the occasional note of but one or two could be heard , showing that nearly all the birds were asleep ; then one faint cry and all was still , and a death-like silence fell upon the island . Hardly had I time to appreciate the relief from the hours made hideous by the noise of the gulls , when from far out over the water there floated in a strange note , which I knew at once must be that of the petrel . Louder and louder this note grew , until at last two birds flew over my head , sailed around me , all the time uttering their sharp , wild , and guttural call . These two birds suddenly disappeared in the darkness , shortly to return with hundreds and hundreds of their kind , until the whole night seemed alive with them , flying with bat-like mo-  | tions , each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swooped down on me and around me , in one instance brushing my hat with their wings . They all seemed to be laboring under the greatest excitement , so great was the confusion . The whole island had come to life again ; wherever one looked , wherever one went , the place swarmed with petrel ; and they had it to themselves , for all the gulls leave the fields at night and roost on the rocks near the sea . After some fifteen minutes another note was heard , and on following the direction from where it came , I was led to one of the burrows , at the entrance of which stood the bird that had been on its nest all day , calling to its mate among the hundreds flying around in a most plaintive , sad little note . They seem to have absolutely no fear of man ? in fact , to ignore his presence ? and will meet their mates almost at one 's feet . After watching them for some time I returned to my tent , which I had erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of their burrows On arriving there , however , I was greatly surprised to find as many petrels as I had left behind , and it seemed as though they came out of the ground in every direction like so many ants . Sleep was impossible , so great was the noise they made ; but it was a different note from the one they uttered when arriving ? a constant twitter , ending in a deep chirp , never ceasing for a moment . During all this time the birds were flying about , truly the busiest , most active little fellows I have ever seen . Just before dawn they suddenly stopped , and , on looking out of my tent , I found they were gone , every one of them , quicker even than they had come , six hours before . Hardly had I returned to the tent when the gulls awoke , and reigned supreme for another day . One might almost be led to believe that the petrel time their arrival and departure by the hours during which the gulls are silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits on the nest , and that her mate is the bird that is hunting far at sea , returning at night to feed her , busy  | in that occupation until dawn , when he is off again . They have three very distinct calls ; one might be named " heralding their arrival " ; another , when calling their mates to their respective homes , " the song of greeting , " and a third , when they are flying about their nests , " the feeding notes . " After their departure in the morning the atmosphere is impregnated for a few hours with the odor of musk . They must emit this liquid while flying about their nests , for the bird has no odor beyond a slightly oily scent . Perhaps it is an instinctive habit , to make the surroundings objectionable to any of their possible enemies during the nesting season . The young are hatched during the latter part of July , and by September 15 they are gone , not to return until the following year . The young are completely covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand resemble a ladies ' powder puff , both in size and texture . The parent birds as a rule leave the nest during the day after the young are hatched , returning at night for the purpose of feeding them . The young birds do not leave the nest until they attain - nearly their full growth and plumage . While the shores of the Bay of Fundy are the principal nesting-places for this bird , Little Duck Island certainly does its share as a nursery for the Leach 's petrel . Thousands and thousands of these birds return to rear their young where they themselves were hatched . One marvels at the instinct which guides them on a foggy night , from several hundred miles out at sea , to a small spot on the ocean scarcely half a square mile in size , and on a course straighter than any ship could be steered . Upon arrival , each flies straight to his own burrow , although there are a hundred next to his , and to the human eye all look alike . Perhaps it is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build their nests , as their ancestors have done , on the cliffs and fields of Little Duck Island .
