President Roosevelt knew , when he called Mr. Henry C. Payne to his Cabinet , after Mr. McKinley 's refusal to give him office , that his political standards were much those of Quay or Platt . Hence Mr. Roosevelt was not entitled to sympathy when Mr. Payne failed to do him credit in office . We are assured that , after the gravity of the postal scandals was recognized , Mr. Payne did his utmost to ' ferret out the offenders But when the first proofs were brought to his attention he denounced them as " hot air , " and did what he could to suppress them , even to the extent of attacking and wrongfully accusing Mr. Seymour W. Tulloch . to whom he never made due reparation . With many genial personal qualities , his first thought was for the party ; the public service came next , and he owed his retention in office to Mr. Roosevelt 's unwillingness to dismiss a Cabinet officer under fire , and turning to Mr. Bristow , to do the actual work of reform . Secretary Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding in his speech at Indianapolis that it is " by no means certain " that the Constitution gives Congress the right to investigate an executive department of the Government . Congress may , it is true , make the laws governing the administrative officials , hut , once made , they have " sole authority . " It is a pity that ' this comfortable doctrine was not discovered long ago . It would have come in uncommonly handy to estop some of the disagreeable inquiries Congress has made  --  into the Conduct of the War , for example , or into the Credit Mobilier and Pacific Mail Subsidy scandals . It is really amusing to see a Secretary puffing himself out in thrs way , as if beyond the reach of the grand inquest of the nation . Mr. Shaw has once or twice come perilously near setting himself above the law , but some one ought ' do tell him that his high and mighty airs will not be stomached by Congress . " I fancy it would cause a commotion , " he says , " if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress " ; but it would be nothing , we can ' assure him , to the commotion that would be caused by a Secretary of the Treasury refusing information to a Congressional committee of investigation . He Would soon find out that the breath whach had made him could also destroy . Secretary Shaw is on the wrong tack . What he should try to convince people is , not that a Democratic House could not lawfully thrusta probe into the department% but that it Would find no rottenness there . Senator Fairbanks is to speak in Wisconsin under the auspices of the La Follette and not the Spooner Republicans . To this extent the National Committee has reversed the position it took last June when it seated the Stalwart delegates in the National Convention . This is undoubtedly a heavy blow to the faction dominated by the " Federal crowd , " led by the two United States Senators and the chairman of the Congressional Committee . Yet according to the standards which the party maintains elsewhere , there would be no excuse for withholding recognition . Even Addicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the other side , receives recognition in every way that the party and President Roosevelt can give it . It is now perfectly certain that if anybody can " deliver the goods " for the national ticket it is La Follette He has received the sanction of the highest State court , and in the caucuses of last week he snatched the city of Milwaukee from the hands of his opponents . " Call off the third ticket , " cry the La Follette Republicans of Wisconsin to Chairman Cortelyou . " The ' Stalwarts were the ones who went to court for vindication . Now that the decision is in our favor , it is ' time for them to withdraw . If the national ticket suffers , it will be their own fault . " Mr. Cortelyou in in the position of a tamer of wild animals who finds two of his charges tearing each other 's throats five minutes before the curtain rises , yet he must present to the audience " our happy family , in which ' savage ' beasts from all quarters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one suppose that the Wisconsin fight can ' be " called off " by any power on earth ? Roth sides long ago passed the point where even a temporary truce could be patched up . The differences , while . small enough on the sur-face , are irreconcilable . The withdrawal of ' the third candidate will not make the Stalwarts vote the regular Republican ticket . His presence in the field is important only ' because ' a vote for Schofield will hurt La Follette but half as much as a vote for Peck . The new appeal unto Csar , however , has another aspect . It places ? on the nati'ona'l leaders once more the responsibility of putting their fingers into the Wisconsin mess . La Follette and his partisans had every reason to feel aggrieved ' at the contenaptumrs and offensive way in which they were " thrown down " ' at ' the Chicago convention . If now the national chairman fails to do what the ? Governor asks ? which , there is much reason to believe , he could not do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Regular Republicans of Wisconsin to feel any obligation to support the national ticket . What crimes men will commit in the name of electing a President , we see again in the news from Delaware . The Addicks and the anti-Addicks Republicans have fused  --  that iS , corruption and decency have fallen into each other 's arms in order to save the State for Roosevelt . Party pressure has been too strong for common honesty . The fight which the anti-Addicks Republicans have been waging for so many years , in the hope of saving Delaware from the foul hands of a public debaucher , they now give over lest the three electoral votes of their State ' be lost to the great preacher of political - purity and the arch enemy of compromise with sin . Better that thirty or three hundred votes were lost to bim than that a single one should be won with the Addicks smirch upon it . The " fusiOn " in Delaware  --  this political mixture of light and darkness , honor and shame  --  was attended by every circumstance of ignominy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor , provided the latter would promise to appoint an Addicks tool Secretary of State When this infamous agreement was first proposed , the Wilmington Evening Journal said of it that not only would it be in plain violation of the Delaware Constitution , but that " the man who would accept on these conditions would be such an obnoxious worm that it would be a proper act to spurn him with our feet . " Pleasant reading for Mr. Preston Lea of Wilmington , the " fused " candidate ! A single word of but three letters marks the only important difference between the Massachusetts Republican platform and that adopted by the National Convention , yet this is all that distinguishes a plank which means something from one that means nothing at all . " Commercial reciprocity " the national platform wanted when it could be secured " without injury to American agriculture , American labor , or any American industry . " One sawmill , one boatload of herrings , could , under this , stand in the way of liberal statesmanship . It took no more courage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " than for a New England RepubliCan to reject this little " any . " Still , in advocating reciprocity with Canada , there was no such rashness as the Democrats shdwed in naming coal , lumber , fish , and natural products as the articles velt will carry the State of New York , but he does not disguise the fact that " a sharp fight " is being made against Mr. Higgins . If there is any soreness in the Republican party , Woodruff is the man to know about it . At this very minute he is lying outside the-breastworks among his bleeding followers , where his eye can note every wound , his ear catch every groan . No marvel that this scene of misery renders him skeptical about the extravagant claims of the Odell managers , based on a " private poll , " and about the " developments before election day which will amaze the Opposition and cement the Republicans into a solid and united party " It was ex-Gov Frank S. Black who , in his speech nominating Roosevelt , sneered at the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Black follows the method of those church fathers who used to recommend as a spiritual exercise the contemplation first of the sin of the angels , and then the sin of Adam and Eve . If he is interested in the spectacle of factional strife , upon which he philosophizes with so much vivacity , he has but to look about him in his own party . The theory that Mayor McClellan 's removal of the Civil Service Commission was nothing but a political trick is too clever by half . It was not only- a " McCarren man " who had to go , but two " Murphy men " as well . In any case , the reasons given for the dismissals are sound and sufficient Officials who violate the law must not whimper when they are visited by the penalties of the law . And it must not be forgotten that the Mayor 's sincerity will soon be in the way of a conclusive test . He is now under double bonds to act similarly in any new cases of the kind brought to his attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to him with every well-founded complaint . He will be bound to follow his own precedent . No doubt the new Civil Service Commission will bear watching . Mr. Coler 's record is not inspiring to reformers , but he has the fate of his delinquent predecessor before his eyes . When Judge Parker quoted a decision of the Supreme Court in support of his contention that the common law provides a remedy for the evils caused by Trusts , he did not realize upon what a feeble reed he leaned . The whole question has been carried to the October term of the Review of Reviews ; and that august tribunal , the entire editorial board sitting in bane ? , has unanimously reversed the Supreme Court . The opinion , which was delivered by Shaw , C. J. , states that the defendant , one Parker , although " a gentleman of fine mental poise , " has not shown " a very masterful grasp of national affairs . " This , the opinion continues , " was to be expected " from one who had devoted himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kindly , but firmly , Mr. Justice Shaw lays down what is now the law of the land , and shows that " the common law has no application to matters of national concern , " and that the Trusts can " be dealt with from the national standpoint " only by " the enactment of Federal ' statutes . " This is the end of the matter ; henceforth the case of the Rough Rider vs. the Judge is res adiudicata . While the question was before the lower courts , we expressed the belief that the weight of authority was on the side of the Judge . That opinion we are now obliged to recall . We admit , with shame , that we had no basis for it except a decision of the Supreme Court ; but now that the law has uttered its final word , we hasten to correct ? the error . Like the House of Lords , the Review of Reviews can not reverse itself ; add there is nothing for the Judge to do but to take to the tall grass . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had- himself killed four men at different times and yet gone unpunished , has stirred Southern newspapers to further denunciations of the prevalent lawlessness . They have at last awakened to the fact that so insidious a moral disease must be checked the instant it first shows itself unless the whole surrounding country is to be infected . The Atlanta Constitution , the Columbia ( S. C. ) State , the Charlotte Observer , and many others are daily calling upon their readers to redeem the South 's good name . The State , for one , realizes what material injury is being done to the cotton States by the frightening away of capital and immigrants . All this , as we have said before , is highly encouraging . But the Southern newspapers will not do their whole duty unless they are ready to follow the State 's lead and include in their denunciations the Tillmans , Vardamans , Jeff Davises , and others who seek political honors by abusing negroes and by inciting to lawlessness and race hatred . The latest offender is Congressman J. T. Heflin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that no harm would have been done if Roosevelt and Booker Washington had been blown up when they dined together . This , he now explains , was only a joke , but he said in earnest that if Mr. Washington interfered in the Congressional contest , " there is a way of stopping him . We have a way of influencing negroes down here when it becomes necessary . " In a noteworthy article in the Forum Prof. Kelly Miller calls attention to the readiness with which the entire negro race is condemned for certain crimes , - just as if no white men were ever guilty of them . In 1890 no less than 81 white persons were convicted in the United States of the " unmentionable crime . " In the city of Chicago in one year , more white men were arrested and convicted for this offence than there were negroes charged with it in the entire South . In 1902 there were 148 persons arrested for it in New York city alone , as against fifty negroes who were done to death for the crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nobody comments on the New York or Chicago offenders , or is particularly excited over them , while the whole country is informed of the " black scourge . " " If , " he adds , " cases of lightning-stroke were advertised with as much horrifying particularity , we should all live in momentary dread of the terror of the sky . " A recent study of lynching by a Yale graduate shows that of 1,872 negro victims of mob law , only 35 per cent . were killed on the charge of rape . How many innocent men there were even among them nobody can tell . Kuropatkin has begun his advance southward , and has already engaged the enemy in force . This shows his entire confidence in the Siberian railroad , whose successful operation has been the marvel of the war . When the first blow was struck , there was a general assumption that the management would collapse . The rails were too light , and there were too few sidetracks to permit the handling of many troop trains . The crossing of Lake Baikal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese bandits , or daring raiding parties were certain to blow up bridges and cut the line with sufficient frequency to make it unworkable . Finally , it was pointed out that the supplying of an army at such a distance by one frail line of railroad was an unheard-of undertaking . Yet the Siberian railway has done more than was expected of it , having been blocked only for two weeks early in the summer . No spies or raiders have done any injury worth speaking of , and the building of the line around Lake Baikal has just been successfully finished . More than that , Gen Kuropatkin has had all the rolling stock he needed at his immediate disposal at his end of the line . The comparative ease with which he retreated from Liaoyang , leaving only insignificant stores to fall into the hands of his disappointed pursuers , is conclusive proof of this . And , despite the retention of emergency and hospital trains , the Siberian railway has brought him more and more men with unceasing regularity , while from no source has there been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food or were in need of ammunition . A winter campaign is in prospect . One thousand millions is the estimate of the cost of the war to Japan made by Count Okuma in a public address at Tokio on Thursday . He doubtless Jiases this on the belief that hostilities can not last more than two years , within which time one or the other of the contestants must stop for very exhaustion . Whatever the outcome , the issue has been bravely faced by the Japanese statesmen . Their financial plans have not thus far miscarried in any particular . Not content with providing for the passing hour , they are looking far into the.financial future . They have shown . our Re- . I ublican editors and politicians who deny the possibility of retrenchment in national expenditures , that they can use the pruning-knife at a time when nations are generally most reckless in their expenditures , by lopping off $10,000,000 in prefectural expenses . If necessary , they will cut clown the schools and Tramper popular education . What a comment upon the alleged benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own development because of a dispute with another Power over the pi cperty of a third , and burden its people with an enormous debt to be paid by future generations ! That an open breach between Chamberlain and Balfour can long be delayed seems improbable after the former 's speech of Wednesday week . There was a distinct note of resentment and warning in it . The Premier 's announcement at Edinburgh a couple of days before that he did not favor protection , seems to have nettled Mr Chamberlain . He himself does not desire " the protection of fifty years ago " , all he wants is that foreigners be made to " pay toll on shipments to the British market " ? in other words , the old protectionist nonsense about the foreigner paying the tax . When it came to the question of a colonial conference and waiting for a general election , Mr. Chamberlain was even sharper in his criticism of the Prime Minister . The prospect of " endless delay , " with repeated consultation of the constituencies , is naturally distasteful to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he is an old man in a hurry . Besides , he now has full control of the CoaservatiVe party organization . He feels that he is master , and that it is Balfour 's part meekly to obey . If anybody wonders how Mr. Joseph Chamberlain finances his protectionist campaign , let him ponder the following incident . A year ago , Mr. White , chairman of the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers , stated that " if the wisdom and statesmanship of the country should declare that duties on some manufactures should be levied , cement was an article that would cry aloud to be included . " The same gentleman hasjust new reported that the profits of his concern had increased during the past twelvemonth by some $100,000 . Evidently , therefore , what his industry is " crying aloud " for is not protection , but swollen gains . And equally evident is the fact that the men who hope to see their profits multiplied by law , are willing to help Mr. Chamberlain get control of the lawmaking body , in expectation of favors to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of corruption that has always attended protective tariffs . English sticklers for purity in public life will have got a severe shock in the election of Mr. Marks for the Isle of Thanet . Though successful by a reduced Conservative majority , this candidate 's private character had been openly assailed He was charged with financial irregularities of a grave sort . So intense was the dislike to having a man of his record stand for Parliament that the London Times kicked over the party traces and said that Mr. Marks ought to be defeated ; while a letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury was used against him , though it merely insisted in general terms upon the duty of giving a seat in the Commons only to reputable men . But the constituency was doggedly Conservative , and doubtless thought it was better to elect a protectionist under a cloud than a free-trader above challenge personally . " The German Empire must be very ' strongly welded together if it is not to be injured by such discussions and happenings , " is the view of the Berlin Yossisehe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lippe-Detmold succession . The truth is , that there is friction from time to time betw een the component parts of the Empire and the Federal Government , and , though Lippe is but a tiny part of the Emperor 's domains , his remarkable attempt to influence its affairs Is bound to cause uneasiness elsewhere . In Detmold there is natural indignation . The chief minister has dared to " hurl defiance at the forces trying to overturn the present order , " and the delegate to the Reichstag would express his views if only the law of leze-majesty permitted . The dynastic questions involved were thoroughly threshed out in 1897 when the late regent was installed , and it is therefore particularly annoying to his subjects to have the Kaiser reopen it now in favor of his brother-in-law , vlhose pretensions to the regency were unfavorably passed upon by a special court of arbitration composed of six members of the Supreme Court of the empire . This court held that the late regent was entitled to the succession . It is for a reversal of this carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
