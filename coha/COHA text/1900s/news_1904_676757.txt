txt Two rushing storms burst over the city yesterday , carrying death and destruction ? principally across the East River in Kings and Queens . Two persons , a man and a boy , were instantly killed by lightning bolts in Brooklyn during the second storm . The records show that death came to them at exactly the same time , 5:20 o'clock , although they were six miles apart at the time . The first storm sent people scurrying everywhere for safety in the belief that something approaching a cyclone was coming . Then came a fall of rain that made it seem as if the clouds had burst . The play of lightning was almost continuous . Several hours later came the second storm , with even more brilliant electric displays and more violent thunder crashes than the first . The boy killed in Brooklyn was Samuel Kaplan of 312 Osborne Street , East New York . Young Kaplan had been to Jamaica Bay during the day , and was returning home wi , h two boy companions . They took shelter during the early downpour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get home reached an open field at Christopher Street and Newport Avenue , which was covered by about a foot of water . The boy sat down to take off his shoes to wade when a bolt of lightning struck him on the right side of the head , literally scalping him . The doctors said that the 1 bolt passed clear through the boy 's body . The lad was thrown over on his face and half buried in the soft sand on which he had been sitting . When the police dug him out they found that his clothing had been turn off . Kaplan 's two boy companions were thrown down by the shock , but were not badly injured . William Hagan , a truckman , of Grand Avenue and Dean Street , was driving his truck on Seventh Avenue near Third Street , Brooklyn . when a bolt struck him on the 1 shoulder . lie was hurled from his seat and landed in the street twenty feet away . A number of persons who witnessed the occurrence said that a ball of fire seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue haze . When he was picked up dead it was found that Hagan 's clothing had been cut down from the right shoulder to his feet , as if with a keen razor . At about 2:40 o'clock great banks of clouds E- , athered in the southwest . These seemed to be driven hither and thither fur a time . Then a great mass of cloud gathered over the bay , gradually becoming thicker until it resembled a huge clay bank in the sky . A blackness , almost that of night , fell over the city , and throughout the down-town section lights glimmered in the big office buildings . Except for the temperature , it looked as though the end of a Winter day had suddenly been transplanted into August . A flash of lightning and a crash of thunder , like the boom of a hundred guns , marked the beginning of the rainfall , which for twenty minutes was little short of a cloudburst . Between 2:50 and nelli o'clock there fell . according to the official records , 5t ; - 100 of an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downpour . Many , however , who were caught in the deluge and had to wade , would be willing to swear that at least a foot of rain fell . The downpour played all kinds of pranks with shipping . Ferryboats abandoned their schedules entire:y during the hour and thirteen minutes that the first storm lasted . It was impossible in midstream to see a boat 's length ahead . The damage dune by the lightning during this storm was especially severe in Brooklyn . A Gates Avenue trolley car was struck at Bushwick and Gates Avenues . and if it had nut been that all of the fifteen persons in it were huddled in the two front seats to get away from the rain there would have been a story of fatalities to tell . The bolt struck the trolley pole , and burned a hole through the roof of the car . It struck the back of one of the seats in the middle of the car , and ran down the side of the seat to the steps and into the ground . The vivid flash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers . and one woman fainted . Two others jumped off the swiftly moving car , which was then stop7ed . The women were picked up , suffering only from a few bruin ' s. calvary Episcopal Church . on Bushwick Avenue . opposite Ralph Street , Brooklyn , has a wrecked bell tower as a result of the storm . The lightning hit the square tower in the middle of the frame structure , and , besides wrecking the tower , scattered shingles and sla'es for 104 ) feet around . A hole was burned in the roof of the church , which might well have been destroyed but for the downpour , which effectually put out the fire . There was a lively time in the corset factory of T. J. Menahan. half a block from the church , when the lightning struck one of the chimneys . Six hundred girls are employed in the place , and when they heard the crash and saw the lightning playing about the roof , they abandoned their machines , and fled screaming to the street . Beyond a wrecked chimney no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of 125 Sumner Avenue , and Mrs. Edna Rodgers of 22 Church Street , East New York , were so badly shocked by lightning that they had to be taken to their homes in ambulances after having been ' brought to Conscious- 1 ness . The women had sought shelter from the second storm in a doorway at Jamaica and Alabama Avenues and Fulton Street . Just opposite is Charles Emlas 's hotel , on which was a tall flagpole . The lightning struck the pole , shattering it . and a large section dropped to the street . The electricity then played about the net of trolley wires at this point , and several hundred people who were near were temporarily blinded by the glare . After the terrific crash of thunder that followed it was found that several people had been thrown down , but only Miss Bennett and Mrs. Rodgers were unconscious . When lightning struck the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Lourdes , at Aberdeen Street and Broadway , Brooklyn , 200 persons praying in the church were thrown into half a panic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results might have been serious . He quieted the people , mostly women , and then all prayed for the storm to abate . The heavy flagpole surmounting the northern tower of the church was cut off at the base , as if with a saw , and was hurled into the street . The roof was afire for a time , but the rain soon put ft out . The only place in which the wind did any damage was in Coney Island , where it had a full sweep during the second storm . A veritable whirlwind came from the sea at 5:30 o'clock . Directly in its path was an encampment of tents at the foot of West Thirty-first Street . In them were fortytwo sick children . mostly sufferers from tuberculosis . The camp was instituted by the Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor . The tents were blown down and the little sufferers in them were drenched by the rain . The nurses , headed ty Miss Alice Thompson , kept their heads about them , however , and soon had the little ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan and Brooklyn the afternoon rainfall was heaviest ; at the came time it was comparatively light in Harlem and the Bronx .
