 |p655  In the twenty-five years that I have been before the public . I have been pressed some hundreds of times by young people , and some no longer young , natives of various parts of the globe , to express my opinion with regard to the stage as offering a career for ambiticus talent , and more particularly relating to the business of the stage , in which , I am supposed to excel . By business I refer to that phase of the profession which deserves consideration quite apart from the artistic side , and something that seems to be quite beneath the genius of the average aspirant . My answer to these questions has always been practically the same ? that sincerity alone wins with an American audience ; and that however much native talent one may have , without sincerity , and secondly , the ability to - withstand repeated discouragements , the footlights oiler a poor recompense for fears tied tears , abundant toil on small compensation and energy untiring . And looking back over these years , I can see a vast change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer the haphazard , wildcat. marionette affair that recruited its bright lights from Vagabondia , synonymous with tie-walking , greasy gowns and a trail of dissipation from province to province , when theater-going was indulged in on the sly , the actress mortally shunned and the play house the horrible example of nearly every pulpit Thanks to a few uplifting geniuses , both players and managers , and above all to the better eIement of the great American public , which refuses to patronize the meretricious and the inartistic , the stage to-day is a perfect Iv running machine as unlike that of the past as a wooden-cog clock to a judge 's stop-watch . The play has become a business as much as banking and insurance : and whatever individual aptitude the aspirant may have , the business phase of it mast enter largely into the equation . The public taste has changed , and is constantly changing , and the stage is what the public makes it ? reflects the public mind as the snxlnth lake mirrors the image that bends to its very depth , though apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made my debut in the western part of this state , fresh from Canada , with a fund of health and ambition as a singer , though a mere tot , the stage was a very shabby institution . I have watched it improve year by year , and what is more , improve on purely American lines . This is a great gratification to me , for I am American to the bone , even though I was born of Scotch parentage in the forests of the North . Morally as well as artistically , the standard of intelligence of audiences , as well as actors , has improved , till now- I believe it to be one of the most powerful instruments for good in our whole social well-being ; and  |p656  the few exceptions only serve to prove the rule . Kings and princes have allowed the rigid barriers between thrones and the footlights to melt away the pulpit has consented to regard the stage seriously as an educational factor : society , which is usually spelled with a capital to distinguish its exclusive prerogatives , has met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supercilious manner of the past , but as a legitimate and altogether worthy aspirant for public favor . meriting the regard of all classes . I believe this largely due to the sincerity and earnestness with which young people enter the ranks of the profession with an eye to making it a business and not a pastime , a profession and not a quick corridor into the ranks of lower bohemia : a worthy end , and not a makeshift or haphazard expedient till something supposed to be better happens along , presumably a titled husband or a banker 's daughter . People who regard the stage through the glamour of the footlights do not realize that that apparent fairyland is as monotonous in its system as a countinghouse , that its rules are as rigorously exact as a military barracks in time of war . Every one is bent upon fulfilling some ditty to the best of the artist 's ability : and with the least slip . the whole company ? yes , the whole playhouse , audience and all , is compromised . It is this continual strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture for the benefit of whitings and the vicious simply impossible . It seems to the audience that it is the easiest thing in the world to go through an act ? that everything is fortuitous , and nothing delicately planned , from the setting of the scene to an inflection of the voice that brings a laugh or tear . Every member of a company carries a portion of the entire burden and takes personally the lash of criticism for the lapse , the blunder , or the failure of any one to maintain the standard of excellence which may be called the collective honor of the company that all are bound to uphold through all . And this business of the stage grows more complicated and exact every year , and further removed from it in consequence is all the mountebank flippancy that characterized the average theater in the past . Midnight suppers birds , bottles , and high jiuks generally , are no more possible to one who would succeed in it than to one who would become a successful banker or drive the Limited Express with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The responsibility is too great , and the danger of lapsing in public regard too certain , to make ant thing but singleness of aim and absolute fidelity to the individual part , as well as to the honor of the company as a whole , the paramount gospel of the footlights . So much for the nonsense believed by the unthinking and disseminated by the unjust , that stage-life is the easiest of all careers , that time hangs so heavily on the actor 's hands that when not actually prancing along the footlights he is giving himself up to the flatteries of women and the reductions of the cup that cheers and also inebriates . But I suppose that this delusion will pervade some porof the public mind as long as there are paragraphers who will exploit cynicism at the expense of truth , and caricaturists who will perpetrate dressing-room imaginings of impossible women in fraudulent periodicals upon a farce-loving public . And this brings me to another conviction that must come to the mind of every stageworker sooner or later , particularly here in America : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very transient commodity to count upon . In England I have seen an audience go wild over some poor , brokendown singer . listening with rapt awe , not for the glory of his present effort , but in reverence for what he was twenty years  |p657  before . That is because in England recreation is a serious business , and theater-going is not regarded as it is here ? a mere forgetting -- time between long struggles in the money-mad whirl of the metropolis . In London a bank clerk will save up for a week to afford a stall at the opera or theater , dreaming of it for days before and after the actual enjoyment . and his impression is lasting . With us it is all so different . We may be challenged with the trite reproof that republics are ungrateful . but the facts remain , and the public entertainer is in the best possible position to know that the success of yesterday does not insure the success of to-day , and today 's prosperity with a good play will not in the least atone , nor save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who live in the present . the past is little or nothing , and the future brings little worry , for fortunes are made , unmade and made again almost in a day . The actor , then , who does not achieve a high standard by hard labor and by harder labor maintain it , is simply lost in the handicap . The shout and hurrah , the flowers lifted over the bass drum , and the lurid press notices , of to-night 's performance do not insure against the absolute downfall of the one given a year hence : and even an auspicious first night may see an apathetic public sniffing at the bill-boards and roving down the street a day or two later . I never take nay initial cue at any performance , the first or the five-hundred-and-first night of the run , without a little qualm of uncertainty and a fear that the applause of last night 's audience will give way to a cold patronage This is an illustration of the little faith that I have in the lasting affections of the public . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowing to the inevitable result of our American institutions which I nevertheless revere and honor , of which I am a part and parcel , and proud to be so . It is merely yielding to the spirit of the times , an acknowledgment of the ephemeral nature of our most accepted enterprises and the restless , nobly discontented trend of our national character with which I myself am imbued to the core . But if this keeps the player ever on the brink of oblivion , as it were , it also quickens the spirit to ever-renewed effort , and is alter all the grandest stimulant . The artist knows that the audience is saying : " Yes . that is good . Let us cheer with a will . But all the saute -- - ' ' And here they do not say , " You should have seen Edwin Forrest or Mrs. Siddons forty years ago , " but , " Wait six months or a year . and there will come along a play or a star that will make all this look like a firefly in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very uncertainty of the actor 's hold upon it makes him strain mightily to retain that which he has striven mightily to attain , for heaven help hint if he fail . But again , if there is seeming ingratitude on the part of the public , it is nothing to that which the leader in the profession must contend with from the unthankfulness of those taken from the ranks of obscurity and licked into a shape that is acceptable to the public ' . I can recall few instances of positive and lasting gratitude on the part of any of my support in whom I have discerned some inkling of genius and developed it patiently and conscientiously to  |p658  their lasting benefit . I must say in all justice that there are some exceptions , and the remembrance of these I hold very dear . But after a star has coached and drilled , labored over and encouraged step by step the embryonic Thespian till the aspirant has found favor with the public , like as not the youth will repay these efforts by going over to a rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . allow the flatteries and hospitality of stagedoor satellites to beguile the favorite into dissipation and prodigality , to the banishment of artistic ideals and the inevitable ruin of the person of promise . The artist does not seen to realize that as long as one is an accepted idol of the public 's evanescent w orship , one will be sought out , lauded and champagned into the illusion that one has attained the acme of human achievement : but that the moment the player is relegated to the rear ranks rivalrous connection on the part of sycophants and knaves ceases , and the dupe is abandoned by the very sirens that contributed to the ruin . These temptations that beset the actor or actress are manifold and disastrous ; and strong indeed is the character that resists them . A subtle perception of the hidden value of every line is part of the business of the stage , and something that requires the most constant study and development . I have taken a keen ? perhaps even abnormally keen -- perception of the humorous and the surprising , in either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have transposed a single line a score of times to bring out more clearly its meaning , and more than that , have rehearsed it in a hundred different ways , trying it on the public variously , so as to get the best laugh at the quickest moment after delivery . Still more , I have tried every expression of countenance to suit the line , from a broad grill or a funereal severity to absolute marble blankness of countenance , keenly noting the effect on the audience and almost every person of the audience . People who are not familiar with life before the public can not realize the value of absolute . reciprocity between artist and audience . Nothing escapes the player 's keen eye . a listless yawner of the front row sending down the spirits more than the roar of both galleries has the power to elate . And not only do I watch the effect of my own lines on the audience , but those of every one of the cast , with whose parts I ant of course equally familiar . One can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience is with one ? whether it is going to be plain dallying over a clover meadow- , or a veritable San Juan hill of conquest Audiences seem oftentimes to take the color and spirit of some one or two strong souls that dominate thcnt , whether receptive or surly , repellent or genially enconraging . Sometimes struggling through tIt jolliest act is like battering down a stony wall , so unresponsive is the audience , while again , one single burst of laughter will go off like a percussion-cap and start a whole cannonading of merriment . after which all is easy . It is part of the business of the  |p659  stage to maintain like composure in both extremes , never to be unduly elated with Vociferous response , nor yet show by gesture or intonation the depression that may the eating away at your very heart . In fact , the chief business of the stage is being always the master of the situation . It is a hard lesson to learn , for one can acquire it only by experience , and that takes years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes for American plays . as for expressions of American talent generally . I think our national life is varied and stirring enough to furnish the strongest situations without rumchronism or straining points to accomplish tllenl . In the last decade we have produced two or three Veritable classics , and I know of scarcely a district of our wide domain that is not capable of great things ill the hands of a master . I think the persistent foreign worship that has afflicted us for some years past is fast disappearing , and that Americans are giving more and more support to native talent . This is very gratifying to one who has seen the stage pass through many cycles of rages and fads , and come out at last clear and strong for wholesome American drama . More than that , our plays ate receiving higher recognition year by year in foreign countries , which shows that we have approached the best transatlantic standards . Our future in this direction is most promising , and of particular consolation to those who insist upon American drama for Americans , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play is in itself part of the business of the stage ? that is. the reconstruction that a play always undergoes more or less after the assigning of the parts . Here is another chance for the inventive genius of the ambitious player , not only to help bring out the spirit of the author , but to assist him in coaching up every part and every line of the part to the required standard . However conversant with stage business a play tight may he , the actor always sees chances for changes to the betterment of the situation and the more telling effect of the lines upon the audience . An intimacy with the literary side of the institution is essential to perfect mastery of stagecraft , and the aspirant can not afford to regard this important factor lightlv . Play wrights are clever people : but few indeed are they that ever see their productions set upon the Stage as they are written . With all his intimate knowledge of literary effect and of stage machinery , after the author has done his best there come two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actor and the manager , both of whom are in a position to make the success of the play or bring defeat , if not ruin . upon all three . To advise every star to become his or her own manager will strike the novitiate as overleaping counsel : but that is about what things will resolve themselves to , after the player is an accepted entertainer and instructor of the public . This brings me to another phase of the business of the  |p660  stage ? one which would re quire several chapters to do justice . A good manager must be a good lawyer , con- with business rules . an accomplished press agent and advertising authority in the front office , and a thorough stage mechanic . scene-painter , musician and all-round genius of expedients behind scenes . When the player achieves such an intimacy with all phases of the craft that to be his or her own manager becomes finite in the nature of things . all these accomplishments must be on the side , as it were . It is plain . then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few years , when an actor who thought if he ( lid a ten-minute turn every night and two matinees he was earning his salary and with two encores was overworked now is compelled to be the most versatile genius in Christendom . These several departments of the business of the stage which I have touched upon include those which can he acquired by patience and industry unflagging , and above all , the ability to bear up against repeated discouragemeuts . But there is one quality which mast be inherent , winch can he learned in no school , and which , while it may be developed greatly for a little , must have a foundation in the natural character . I do not know how to designate this elusive factor in the-player 's very life and success . nor does anybody , for it seems to overleap the most palpable expression . We may term it personal magnetism , if we will , but the truth is , there is nothing that quite defines the necessary reciprocity between player and audience , without which there can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience to applaud and recommend , and the player to endeavor to excel . The human page that nightly spreads so brilliantly before the player is capable of deep reading between the lines , and lost is he whom it es capes . Nightly this page is turned , revealing new lines that are capable of a new reading . Sometimes I think I understand it , sometimes I am in mortal doubt ; but nevertheless , I read it earnestly , eagerly , up and down from margin to margin , between the lines and all , and every sincere etlort is worthy . Witliout this deeper reading of the public mind no player can hope to maintain high position in the public esteem for long . With it , all things are possible , for this gift of genius can reach hidden depths that the ordinary mind can not understand ; and therein lies power .
