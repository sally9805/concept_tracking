At 8:10 o'clock Chairman Patterson called the convention to order , and after a selection by the band , he , recognized Mr. Washburn of Massachusetts , who had the floor when the afternoon session adjourned . Mr. Washbui n spoke at some length in favor of his plan of submitting a list of lire then for Vice President . He yielded the floor to Gen. Weaver , who told the convention that lie was willing to be an ally of the Democratic Party , but wished to do all the dictating to those allies instead of working in concert with them .

" He closed with an appeal to the convention to adopt the plan of Mr. Washburn . Half a dozen delegates were on their feet clamoring for recognition the instant Gen. Weaver concluded , but the Chair recognized E Gerry Brown of Massachusetts , who deprecated the sharp tone the debate was taking . . " Stop throwing bricks at one another , " said be . " If you have anything to say , say it on principle , not on men . " Mr. Brown then came Out in strong opposition to the conference plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas City under any consideration whatever . In the first place , because we have received no invitation , in the second place because no one here is guaranteed to authorize us that , when we step up to the counter at Kansas City with our valises full of credentials of our favorite sons , we Wo n't find the master of the house busy . " ' Mr. Brown closed with an appeal for harmony , no matter what the decision of the convention might be . FREE FIGHT IMMINENT . Edward S. Grece of Michigan was then recognized . But just here an incident occurred that threw the convention into an uproar , and which for a few moments threatened to result in a free fight . " Before Mr. Grece speaks , " said the Chairman , " the Chair wishes to announce that there is a package of letters here for the South Dakota delegation . It was found on a chair and was probably lost by some member of the delegation . " Ex-Congressman John F. Kelly of South Dakota , who had been clamoring for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice shaking with anger said : " The South Dakota delegation is glad to receive this recognition from the chair , for it is the only recognition it has received from you . You are a miserable bunko steerer , " Mr. Kelly shouted . " You came into this convention with professions of good faith . You are not fit to preside over a Populist convention , and you never will again . " : In an instant there was an uproar , and cries of " Put him out ! " were heard . " I rise to a point of order , " shouted Mr. Kelly . " I stand on my rights and you ca n't bunco me out of them . Then , turning toward the wildly shouting delegates . he yelled : " I defy you . I defy you ' to put me out . " Pale with passion he again turned toward Chairman Patterson and . pointing his finger at him , cried : ' You . Sir , are trying to gratify a petty spite originating m to-day 's conference . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shut up ! " and " Shame on you ! " Mr. Kelly returned to his delegation , every member of which was standing on his feet . THE LIE GIVEN . During all the uproar Chairman Patter%on , flushed and apparently nervous , kept pounding with his gavel in a vain effort to restore order . Finally the excited delegates quieted somewhat for a moment . The Chair desires to make an eXplanathen , " said Chairman Patterson . " I have ? apnestly endeavored to let the convention bear from both sides in succession . " " I deny that as a falsehood , " broke in Mr. Kelly , and again the convention became a perfect pandemonium . Several excited delegates stripped off their coats , reade for business , while one gray-bearded , braetny delegate ran toward Mr. Kelly . He was stopped , however , before he reached bine " It was the purpose of the Chairman as soon . as the gentleman recognized conchided to recognize the gentleman from South Dakota , " continued Chairman Patterson , pale with anger . " Because the gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question Mr. Grece was recognized . Therefore I resent the imputation . " , The uproar at this moment became so great that . the Chairman could not be heard , renewed cries of " Put him out ! " wonting from the delegates . As soon as he could be heard Chairman Patterson continued : ' After Mr. Grece concludes I will recognize him , not because he is Mr. Kelly , but because he represents our host , the State of South Dakota . The gentlemen is trying to intimidate the chair . Let me , assure him the chair will not be intimidated . " KELLY RECOGNIZED . Mr. Kelly , surrounded ' by several members of the South Dakaa delegation , was on his feet again by this time and attempted to speak , but a chorus of " Take your seat ! " and " Oh , shut up ! " greeted him , and after a moment 's hesitation he sat down and the convention gradually came to order . Mr. Grece spoke urgently in favor of . sending a committee of conference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chair then recognized Mr. Kelly of South Dakota , who said : " I very much regret the little altercation I had a short time ago , and I also regret that the Chairman should think I intended to intimidate him . I give you my word of honor as a man I intended nothing of the kind . " ? ? Point of order , Mr. Chairman , " shouted a delegate from Nebraska . " I claim the gentleman has no right to take the floor for making personal remarks . " There were loud cries of " Go on , go on , " directed toward Mr. Kelly . " The Chair hopes , " said Chairman Patterson , " that the gentleman will be permitted to say whatever is on his mind regarding the Chairman . " Mr. Kelly resumed : " When the Chairman remarked early this afternoon that he wished all those who desired to take part in this debate to send their names to his desk , I sent in my name within three minutes . Three and one-half hours later I went personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A gentleman of the South Dakota delegation went without my knowledge and asked the same thing . He was promised recognition for me as soon as the speaker then on the floor was through , but it was not given to me . " While I deeply regret what has happened , 1 can not find it in my heart to apologize , especially as I have several times during the day risen to a point of order and have been persistently ignored . I have been all day denied my simple plain rights as a delegate . Personally I do not care to make a speech to this convention , but I have been asked to do so by the delegation of Soutn Dakota , which has done me the honor to make me its Chairman . " Mr. Kelly then turned his attention to the pending question and urged that a nomination be made at once , telling the convention that it was inconsistent with the dignity of the " party to refrain from making it . Mr. Kelly was given an ovation by his fellow-delegates as he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook him by the shoulders until his coat was nearly torn from him . SIMPSON MAKES A SPEECH . or Chairman Patterson asked the convention if they desired any further debate on the question of Vice President . After a long discussion on the parliamentary position of the various motions , amendments , and substitutes , the Chairman held that the original question was the amendment offered by Jerry Simpson , which provided that the National Committee should go to Kansas City for conference with the Free Silver Republicans and Democrats , regarding the Vice Presidency . Mr. Simpson was given the floor for the closing argument in behalf of his amendment . He began by deploring the statements of some of the speakers who predicted the death of the People 's Party . " We have had some little fun here tonight , " he said , " and a little scrap . That sort of thing does n't presage the death of the party . it betokens mental activity . " He then went on in a happy , humorous way , amid much laughter and applause , urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . During his address Mr. Simpson made as eloquent eulogy on Mr. Towne , declaring that he was too good a friend of his to wish to see him put into political cold storage . " How does Mr. Towne feel about it ? " asked Gen. Weaver . " I 'll tell you how he feels , " said Mr. Simpson . " I saw a telegram in this city to-day from Mr. Towne in which he said that he would not think it wise to nominate a Vice President at this time . " This statement provoked a storm , particularly in the ranks of the Minnesota delegation , who loudly demanded to see the telegram . " I have n't got it , " replied Mr. Simpson , " but it is here in the possession of some one , and I promised not to divulge his name . " " Do n't believe a word of it , " shouted Senator Butler , with a laugh . DECIDE TO NOMINATE . Mr. Simpson then concluded with a strong appeal to the convention to appoint a committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of applause when he took his seat . Several delegates attempted to secure recognition , but were shut off by calls of " call the roll . " The substitute introduced by Mr. Simpson was then read by the Secretary , Gen. Weaver 's resolution having been withdrawn by agreement . Mr. Schilling of Wisconsin demanded the roll call on the question , it being Mr. Simpson 's resolution providing for the appointment of a committee to go to reansas City and confer with the Democratic committee in regard to a Vice Presidential candidate . Amid perfect quiet the roll call then began . Faint applause greeted the vote of the Kansas delegation , which was 83 for and 1 against . Minnesota 's forty-six votes were cast against the resolution , as was expected . Twelve votes from the Nebraska delegation went agdInst the resolution . When North Carolina cast 77 votes against the resolution appeared to be beaten , and wheneTexas voted her 121 votes solidly against the resolution the delegation was cheered wildly . Amid much confusion the vote resulted eee votes for and 492 votes against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement of the result Senator Allen arose . Mr. Chairman , " he said , " I desire to name Charles A. Towne of Minnesota for the office of Vice President , and to move that the nomination be made unanimous . " Cries of " No ! No ! " came from several delegates . Jerry Simpson made the point of order that Mr. Washburn 's compromise measure . providing for the selection by ballot of five names to be presented by a committee to the Democratic and Silver Republican Conventions , and from which to endeavor to select a candidate for Vice President , should be acted upon , and the Chair ruled the point well taken . The roll call was ordered on the resolution , which was also defeated , and the Vice Presidential question was at last settled . Senator Allen then took the chair , Chairman Patterson 's voice having given out . Mr. Allen at once announced that nominations of candidates for Vice President were in order , and the call of States for the announcement of names was demanded . Howard S. Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Towne of Minnesota . John Breidenthal of Kansas . J. H. ( " Cyclone " ) Davis of Texas ; T. T. Rhinder of Pennsylvania , and John J.
