 |p733  THE OUTLOOK has asked me to set down on paper some of the changes in the United States which have struck me on revisiting that country . Thirty-four years have passed since I first saw it , and twenty-one years since I spent in it a time long enough to form impressions . The invitation interests me , for much has happened in the period over which I can now look back . Yet it is with diffidence that I comply with the request , because the older a man grows the more does he feel the difficulty of discerning and interpreting social phenomena , and because every time an observer visits America he finds many more phenomena to study than he had found before . My friends , however , say that if it is worth while to discover and point out the changes that are passing on a country , this is most easily done by the visitor who comes at long intervals . As one who has been away from home for some years notices on his return changes of which the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slender youth has filled out into a man , and that the dark locks of thirty have begun to silver at fifty , so he who comes back to any country after a long absence is struck by novel aspects of things which the home-stayer , living continuously among them , has scarcely observed , because the process of change has been slow and unobtrusive . Accordingly , I shall try to enumerate sundry differences between the United States of 1905 and the United States of 1870 or 1883 . About some of them I may be mistaken . Some , again , may be superficial or transient , and yet they may deserve to be remarked , because one may thus be led to think of the underlying influences that are at work . All the changes of which I am about to speak i Copyright , 1905 , the Outlook Company , New York . have come gradually and naturally . In retrospect , one can see that they are such as might have been expected to come , though most of them were not in fact predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and large fact has appeared which nobody looked for , a fact due partly to a sort of contagion spreading from Europe , partly to an unpredictable series of historical accidents ( if anything in history is an accident ) . Of this new fact more hereafter . The other changes seem due to causes which were already at work forty years ago . They have moved on broad and well-marked lines . Most of them show a relation to one another which makes them appear part of the same great movement . Some ? and these are of peculiar interest ? show that America is being more and more drawn into the general current of the world 's movement , not always , perhaps , to her advantage . That which most strikes the visitor to America to-day is its prodigious material development . Industrial growth , swift thirty or forty years ago , advances more swiftly now . The rural districts are being studded with villages , the villages are growing into cities , the cities are stretching out long arms of suburbs which follow the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , even more remarkable than the increase of population , impresses a European more deeply now than ever before because the contrast with Europe is greater . In America every class seems rich compared with the corresponding class in the Old World . The huge fortunes , the fortunes of those whose income reaches or exceeds a million dollars a year , are of course far more numerous than in any other country . But the absence of pauperism is still more remarkable . In 1870 I carefully examined the  |p734  poor-law system of two great Eastern cities , and found that , although there were very few persons needing or receiving support at the public expense , the number was expected to grow steadily and quickly as the cities grew . To-day I am told that in these cities pauperism , though of course absolutely larger , increases more slowly than population . Life has for a long time been comfortable and easy for the workingman and the clerk or shopman , as compared with life for the like class in Europe . But for the classes standing next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1870 in general plain and simple , simpler than the life led by the richer class in England or France . Luxury was then confined to a very few . Simplicity is not so common to-day . The incomes of those who correspond to the so-called " upper middle class " of Europe are much larger than such persons enjoy in Europe , and they live on a more lavish scale . The " easier life , " however , does not mean that life is taken easily . It consists in having and spending more money , not in doing less work . On the contrary , the stress and rush of life seems greater to-day in America than it ever was before . Everybody , from the workman to the millionaire , has a larger head of steam on than his father had . Whether it be true , as many say , that the vital powers are sooner exhausted , I do not know . It would not be strange if this were so . Time is more precious . More pains are taken to save it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this age , more than in any preceding age , wealth means power , offensive power in war as well as financial power in peace . It was an old and favorite commonplace of political moralists that the rich nations , dwelling in fertile plains and enervated by luxury , became the victims of the poor nations , who , inhabiting barren mountains , were hardier and fiercer in fight . It is not so now . Naval war is , above all things , an affair of scientific apparatus , of ironclads , of torpedoes , of guns with long range and quick fire . Land war depends on the best artillery , the best rifles and ammuvtlook 25 March nition , the best commissariat . War is an affair of science , and science is costly . All the great nations can produce good fighting men , and all may happen to have a good general . But some have far greater pecuniary resources than others . None has resources comparable to those of the United States . The Republic is as wealthy as any two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she chooses , of quickly calling into being a vast fleet and a vast army . Her wealth and power has in it something almost alarming . With this extraordinary material development it is natural that , in the United States , business , that is to say industry , commerce , and finance , should have more and more come to overshadow and dwarf all other interests , all other occupations . Every European who visited the country since the beginning of last century seems to have been struck by this fact . It is more striking now than it was thirty-five years ago . But the contrast with Europe is not greater now than it was then . Rather is it less , for in this respect England and Germany have been following in America 's footsteps . In them , too , business interests hold a far more conspicuous place than formerly . The landowner , the professional man , the man of letters , are in those countries relatively less important than they were ; the financier and manufacturer more important . Business is king . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an old one . But one illustration of it struck me as new . Lawyers are now to a greater extent than formerly business men , a part of the great organized system of industrial and financial enterprise . They are less than formerly the students of a particular kind of learning , the practitioners of a particular art . And they do not seem to be quite so much of a distinct professional class . Some one seventy years ago called them the aristocracy of the United States , meaning that they led public opinion in the same way as the aristocracy of England led opinion there . They still comprise a large part of the finest intellect of the Nation . But one is told that they do not take so keen an interest in purely legal and constitutional  |p735  questions as they did in the days of Story and Webster , or even in those of William M. Evarts and Charles O'Conor . Business is king . Commerce and industry themselves have developed new features . Twentytwo years ago there were no Trusts ; and trade-unions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less pervasive , much less thoroughly organized than they were in England . Even then , how ever , corporations had covered a larger proportion of the whole field of industry and commerce in America than in Europe , and their structure was more flexible and more efficient . To-day this is still more the case ; while as for Trusts , they have become one of the most salient phenomena of the country . They fix the attention , they excite the alarm , of economists and politicians as well as of traders in the Old World , while they exercise and baffle the ingenuity of American legislators . Workingmen follow , though hitherto with unequal steps , the efforts at combination which the lords of production and distribution have been making . The consumer stands by , if not with folded hands , yet so far with no clear view as to the steps which he may take for his own protection . Perhaps his prosperity ? for he is prosperous ? helps him to be acquiescent . The example of the United States , the land in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that the world is passing out of the stage of individualism and returning to that earlier stage in which groups of men formed the units of society . The bond of association was , in those early days , kinship , real or supposed , and a servile or quasi-servile dependence of the weak upon the strong . Now it is the power of wealth which enables the few to combine so as to gain command of the sources of wealth ; and the stronger the employers become and the less they have a personal tie ( such as employers once had ) with the workmen , so much the more do the workmen feel compelled to try how they can advance their material interests by the use of similar methods . In both cases there is a loss of that individual liberty which the last generation was taught to expect from the progress of civilization . Power becomes concentrated in few hands , be they those of the men who control the Trusts or those of the men who lead the Unions . Is it a paradox to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individualistic of peoples that they are now the people among whom the art of combination has reached its maximum ? The amazing keenness and energy which were stimulated by the commercial conditions of the country have evoked and have ripened a brilliant talent for organization . This talent has applied new methods to production and to distribution , and has enabled wealth , gathered into a small number of hands , to dominate even the enormous market of America . The growth of manufactures might have been predicted half a century ago , for even then it was known that there were vast deposits of coal and iron , that the American people were highly inventive , and that the increase of population would create a prodigious demand for goods . One result , however , of the extension of manufactures may not have been so fully foreseen . I mean the change in the character of the occupations and dwelling-places of the people . They are ceasing to be a folk of country dwellers . It is not only that the greater cities extend themselves with amazing speed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with villages as to differ little from cities . There is a general disposition to migrate from rural districts to centers of population , where a brisker life and more amusements can be enjoyed . The change is all the more remarkable because agriculture continues to be prosperous . It has been accelerated by those applications of machinery to agricultural work which enable a farm to be worked by a smaller staff than was formerly needed . Wherever one travels in the Eastern and Northern States one sees new towns rising along the lines of railroad and the older towns spreading out . The eye as well as the census table tells one that the people are becoming a people subject to city influences . Already , though the population which lives outside towns with less than eight thousand inhabitants is numerically larger ( almost two-thirds ) , still it is  |p736  urban ways and habits , urban opinion , urban tendencies , that are beginning to prevail in the United States . This process goes on steadily . It will go on all the faster because the good land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically all taken up , while even the irrigation of the dry lands of the south central West can not redress the balance by providing a new rural population to set against the increase of the cities . This is one of the new facts which strikes a visitor , and especially an Englishman . Thirty-five years ago England was already a country of city dwellers , and the United States seemed by contrast a country of agriculturists . Before long the United States will be like England , and , one may almost add , like Germany also , a land in which the urban type of mind and life will preponderate . The change may be regrettable . Jefferson would have regretted it . But it is unavoidable . It will tend to increase that nervous strain , that sense of tension , which Americans are already deemed to show as compared with the more sluggish races of Europe . There will be less repose than ever in life . Health may not suffer , nor the deathrate increase , for cities can now be made to show as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London we have brought down the rate since 1870 from 23 to 17 per thousand . Yet the physical strength of the average man may not be quite the same ; and his mental constitution will almost certainly be different . It may not be inferior ? indeed it may be more alert and versatile . But it will be different . All the changes I have been enumerating tend to make men occupy themselves more than over with their work and with material interests in general . It is true that they have more money , and some of them more leisure . Hours of labor are shortening , as they have shortened , and more generally , in Australia . But as labor is more intense while it lasts , leisure is necessarily given chiefly to amusement . Such conditions may seem unfavorable to intellectual progress . But here comes in another remarkable change which casts a new light upon the landscape and fundamentally affects our estimate of the prospect that lies before the Nation . There has been within these last thirtyfive years a development of the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Previously the Eastern States had but a very few universities whose best teachers were on a level with the teachers in the universities of western Europe . There were a great many institutions bearing the name of university over the Northern and Middle States and'the West , and a smaller number in the South , but they gave an instruction which , though in some places ( and especially in New England ) it was sound and thorough as far as it went , was really the instruction rather of a secondary school than of a university in the proper sense . In the West and South the teaching , often ambitious when it figured in the programme , was apt to be superficial and flimsy , giving the appearance without the solid reality of knowledge . The scientific side was generally even weaker than the literary . These universities or colleges had their value , for their very existence was a recognition of the need for an education above that which the school is intended to supply . I ventured even then to hazard the opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to turn them into schools , reserving the degree-granting power to a selected few only , were mistaken , because improvement and development might be expected . But I did not expect that the development would come so fast and go so far . No doubt there are still a great many whose standard of teaching and examination is that of a school , not of a true university . But there are also many which have risen to the European level , and many others which are moving rapidly towards it . Roughly speaking ? for it is impossible to speak with exactness ? America has now not less , than fifteen or perhaps even twenty seats of learning fit to be ranked beside the universities of Germany , France , and England as respects the completeness of the instruction which they provide and the thoroughness at which they aim . Only a few have a professorial staff containing names equal to those which adorn  |p737  the Faculties of Berlin and Leipzig and Vienna , of Oxford , Cambridge , Edinburgh , and Glasgow . Men of brilliant gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hardly been time to produce a supply equal to the immense demand for the highest instruction which has lately shown itself . It is the advance in the standard aimed at , and in the efforts to attain that standard , that is so remarkable . Even more noticeable is the amplitude of the provision now made for the study of the natural sciences , and of those arts in which science is applied to practical ends . In this respect the United States has gone ahead of Great Britain , aided no doubt by the greater pecuniary resources which not a few of her universities possess , and which they owe to the wise liberality of private benefactors . In England nothing is so hard as to get money from private persons for any educational purpose . Mr. Carnegie 's splendid gift to the universities of Scotland stands almost alone . In America nothing is so easy . There is , indeed , no better indication of the prosperity of the country and of its intelligence than the annual record of the endowments bestowed on the universities by successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a common-school education . Only in one respect does that poverty which Europe has long associated with learning reappear in America . The salaries of presidents and professors remain low as compared with the average incomes of persons in the same social rank , and as compared with the cost of living . That so many men of an energy and ability sufficient to win success and wealth in a business career do nevertheless devote themselves to a career of teaching and research is a remarkable evidence of the intellectual zeal which pervades the people . The improvement in the range and quality of university teaching is a change scarcely more remarkable than the increased affiux of students . It seems ( for I have not worked the matter out in figures , as I am giving impressions and not statistics ) to have grown much faster than population has grown , and to betoken an increased desire among parents and young men to obtain a complete intellectual equipment for life . The number of undergraduates at Harvard is much larger than is the number who resort to Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cambridge ( England ) . Five leading universities of the Eastern States ? Harvard , Yale , Columbia , Princeton , Pennsylvania ? count as many students as do all the universities of England ( omitting in both cases those who attend evening classes only ) , although there are twice as many universities in England now as there were forty years ago , and although the English students have much more than doubled in number . And whereas in England the vast majority of students go to prepare themselves for some profession ? law , journalism , medicine , engineering , or the ministry of the Established Church there is in America a considerable proportion ( in one institution I heard it reckoned at a third or more ) who intend to choose a business career , such as manufactures , or banking , or commerce , or railroading . In England nearly every youth belonging to the middle or upper class who takes to business goes into a commercial office or a workshop not later than seventeen . In the United States , if he graduates at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is twenty-one or twenty-two . This practical people does not deem these three years lost time . They believe that the young man is all the more likely to succeed in business if he goes to it with a mind widely and thoroughly trained . To say that the proportion of college graduates to the whole population is larger in America than in any European country would not mean much , because graduation from a good many of the colleges means very little . But if we take only those colleges which approach or equal the Vest European standard , I think the proportion will be as high as it is in Germany or Switzerland or Scotland , and higher than it is in England . This feature of recent American development has an important bearing on the  |p738  National life . It is a counterpoise to the passion , growing always more intense , for material progress , to the eagerness to seize every chance , to save every moment , to get the most out of every enterprise . It tends to diffuse a taste for scientific and literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries , few opportunities have been opened for acquiring such a taste . It adds to the number of those who may find some occasion in their business life for turning a knowledge of natural science to practical account , and so benefiting the country as well as themselves . Nor is its social influence to be overlooked . One is frequently impressed in America by the attachment of the graduates to the place of their education , by their interest in its fortunes , by their willingness to respond when it asks them for money . In the great cities there are always University Clubs , and in some cities these clubs have become centers for social and political action for good publ : c ends . Not unfrequently they take the lead in municipal reform movements . When I pass from the places set apart for the cultivation of letters and learning to the general state of letters and learning in the community , it is much more difficult to formulate any positive impressions . One feels a change in the spirit of the books produced , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one can not say exactly in what the alteration consists , nor how it has come , nor whether it will last . Having no sufficient materials for a theory on the subject , I can venture only on a few scattered remarks . Literary criticism , formerly at a low ebb , seems to have sensibly improved , whereas in England many people doubt if it is as acute , as judicious , and as delicate as it was in the sixties . The love of poetry and the love of art are more widely diffused in America than ever before ; one finds , for instance , a far greater number of good pictures in private houses than could have been seen thirty years ago , and the building up of public art galleries has occupied much of the thought and skill of leading citizens as well as required the expenditure of vast sums . Great ardor is shown in the investigation of , dry subjects , such as questions of local history . The interest taken in constitutional topics and economic questions , indeed in everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great as it is in Germany or France , and greater than in Britain . This interest is , indeed , confined to one class , which chiefly consists of university teachers , but it is a new and a noteworthy phenomenon . Few people thought or wrote on these matters thirty years ago . On the other hand , it is said , and that by some who have the best special opportunities for knowing , that serious books , i. e. , books other than fiction and the lighter forms of belles-lettres , find no larger sale now , when readers are more numerous and richer , than they did in the seventies . No one can fail to observe the increasing number and popularity of the magazines : and it seems likely that they are now more read , in proportion to books . than they used to be . The same thing is happening in England . It is a natural , consequence of the low prices at which , owing to the vast market , magazines containing good matter and abundant illustrations can be sold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes the ordinary American little disposed to sit down to work his way through a book . Both these factors are more potent in the United States than they were ever before , or than they are in Europe . If in America as well as in England the growth of population has not been accompanied by a growing demand for books ( other than fiction ) , let us remember and allow for the results of another change which has passed upon both countries . It is a change which is all the more noticeable in America because it is there quite recent . It is the passion for looking on at and reading about athletic sports . The love of playing and watching games which require strength and skill is as old as mankind , and needs no explanation . So the desire not to play but to look on at chariot races and gladiatorial combats was a passion among the people of Rome for many centuries . The circus factions at Constantinople have their place in history ,  |p739  and a bad place it is . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has now grown to vast proportions . It occupies the minds not only of the youth at the universities , but also of their parents and of the general public . Baseball matches and football matches excite an interest greater than any other public events except the Presidential election , and that comes only once in four years . The curse of betting which dogs football as well as horse-racing in England seems to be less prevalent in America ; nor do the cities support professional football clubs like those which exist in the towns of northern England and even of Scotland . But the interest in one of the great contests , such as those which draw forty thousand spectators to the great " Stadium " recently erected at Cambridge , Massachusetts , appears to pervade nearly all classes more than does any " sporting event " in Great Britain . The American love of excitement and love of competition has seized upon these games , but the fashion , like that of playing golf and that of playing bridge , seems to have come from England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations between the two countries that speak the same language that fashions of this kind pass so quickly from the one to the other and do not pass from either to Continental Europe . There has been no development of the devotion to athletic sports in Germany or in France coincident with that which is so marked a ' feature of modern England and so novel a feature in America . No subject fixes the attention of social philosophers in Europe who seek for light from the New World more than does the problem of divorce . The States of the Union have tried many experiments , and some rash experiments , in this field . The results , momentous for America , may be instructive for the rest of mankind , and are being watched with curiosity by European sociologists . Mr. Gladstone was so profoundly interested in the matter that whenever conversation turned upon the United States he began to inquire about the divorce laws and their working . Such information as I could gather does not enable me to say whether the position is substantially different from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many observers regret had , in most States , come into operation . There does , however , seem to be a growing reaction against the laxity of procedure in divorce suits , as well as against the freedom granted by the States which have gone furthest ; and though little is heard of the proposal that Congress should receive power to pass a general divorce law for the whole country , the suggestion that efforts should be made to induce the States to introduce greater uniformity , and to make the procedure for obtaining divorce less liable to abuse , finds increasing favor . It is encouraging to note a stronger sense , among thinking men , of the evils which laxity tends to produce . Serious as these evils are , the general moral standard of the United States still appears to me , as it did twenty years ago , to be , on the whole , higher than that of western Europe . ( The differences between France , Germany , and England are not so great as is commonly supposed . ) Even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lays men and women most open to temptation , there are apparently fewer scandals than the same class shows elsewhere . Nor is the morality of any country to be measured by the number of divorces . Its condition maybe really worse if people cynically abstain from obtaining divorces where there are grounds for obtaining them . Although there is more wealth in America than in England , luxury is less diffused , and that idle and self-indulgent class which sets a bad example to other classes is relatively smaller . Among minor changes which the traveler notes , he must not forget the growth of what may be called esthetic sentiment . The desire to have beauty around one , to adorn the house within and the grounds without , if not new , has developed apace since 1870 . In one respect it is much more active in the United States than in most parts of Europe . We have in England , so far as I know , none of those Village Improvement Societies which have arisen in some of the Northern States , and especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself with such a superb ring of parks and open spaces , some hilly and rocky , some covered with wood , some studded with lakes , as Boston now possesses . America used to be pointed at by European censors as a country where utility was everything and beauty nothing . No one could make such a reproach now . One melancholy exception may , however , be referred to . Niagara has lost much of the charm that surrounded it in 1870 . Hideous buildings line the banks of the river below the Falls , almost as far down as the railway bridge . The air is full of smoke . Goat Island has , indeed , been preserved ; the Canadians have laid out a park just below the Horseshoe Fall ; and the volume of the green flood that rushes over the precipice has not been visibly diminished by all that is now abstracted to work the great turbines . But the wildness of nature and the clear purity of the sky have departed . It is a loss to the whole world , for the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorn cities and improve the amenity of villages is near of kin to the sentiment which cherishes the scenes of historical events and the places associated with eminent men . Here , too , one feels in the United States the breath of a new spirit . Reverence for the past and a desire to maintain every sort of connection with it has now become a strong and growing force among educated people . A slight but significant illustration of the changed attitude may be found in the disposition to expect university and ( in some places ) judicial officials to wear on formal occasions an official dress . Thirty years ago no such dress was worn by any functionary in the United States except the judges of the Supreme Court sitting at Washington . I must pass over many other points in which new facts , disclosing new tendencies , present themselves to the observer 's eye . One among them is the attitude of the churches towards one another , and the wider channels in which religious opinion now flows . Another is the position of women , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who seemed to be impartial told me that this had not brought women any more into politics , as a similar change has done in England . They said , indeed , that the woman suffrage movement , which at one time seemed to be rapidly advancing , had of late years experienced a check . But I am far from trying to reckon up all or even most of the changes of thirty-five years . Sensible of the difficulty of conveying to my younger readers an idea of the impression that America made on European travelers just after the war , still more sensible of the still greater difficulty of conveying the impression which America , now far vaster and more complex , makes on the traveler to-day , I attempt no more than to indicate some of the more obvious differences between those days and the present . The subtler differences , of which there are many , would need a fuller and more analytic treatment . I reserve for another paper those aspects of the subject , also comparatively patent and capable of explanation , which belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps I have been overbold in venturing , after a brief visit , to record so many impressions , hastily formed , upon large questions . But I am encouraged by the kindness wherewith the comments on American affairs which I made sixteen years ago have been received . And it is hard to resist the temptation to express one 's admiration for the richness and variety of the forms in which civilization has developed itself in the United States , for the inexhaustible inventiveness and tireless energy of the people . for the growing passion for knowledge . the growing desire to diffuse happiness and enlightenment through every part of the community .
