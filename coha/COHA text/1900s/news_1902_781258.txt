txt Confirmation of the report that the visit of Dr. Kuyper , the Dutch Premier , to London this week was connected with the proposed reopening-of the peace negotiations between the Boers and the English seems positive in spite of the craftily qualified denials Of Dr. Kuyper to the journalists at The Hague and of Lord Salisbury to Lord Rosebery in the House of Lords . The belief pevails here that peace is in sight and City men are more certain of it than ever and the croakers out of Parliament are silenced for the moment . On Thursday there was much ado because it was learned that the Government had commandeered the telegraph to South Africa for its own use , and this . coupled with the news of Dr. lettyper 's hurried and mysterious visit created great excitement , but the War Office or the Colonial Office often needs all the wires for it s own use for some hours , and The visit of the Dureh Premier from his home on only a ten hours ' journey w-as not amazing of itself .

Parliament has resumed its sittings with small promise now of any decrease in.the flood of all but purposeless talk , which , in later years , chiefly distinguishes that august and ancient body . When we have said that some of the talk thus early in the session has been pretty good talk , we have said all . Lord Rosebery continues to occupy his ennmalous , isolated position in the House of Lords , and in the Commons Sir Henry cnmpbell-Bannerman continues to try to hold together the various utterly discordant branches of the Opposition in his usual bungling way . Lord Rosebery 's speech on the first day was a delight to hear , and reads well , as all his speeches do . but it was not the sort of utterance likely to produce anything advantageous to his party . His and Lord Spencer 's harping on old strings certainly suggests that neither of these noble Lords has an inkling that the Government is more nearly out of its troubles than at the close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems so  --  ought to have some knowledge of what is going on in high circles . THE IRISH QUESTION . The Irish question , in all its various manifestations , arose with the very opening of the session in all its might and with all its characteristic bewilderment of surprises and humors . Poor , nervous , irascible Swift MacNeill stuttered the first bull of the season from the Nationalist benches . Yesterday he cried , out to A , J. Balfour , Government leader in the House of Commons : " Wien will the Buller heliogrant and telegrams be published ? Answer ' es or no . " And roars of appreciative laughter arose from the Conservative side . Unhappily , there is no promise of any of the perennial Irish problems being solved this session , If , indeed , any whole-hearted attempt will be made to solve them while the present Government is in power . The great body of rather sodden middle-class English sentiment is stubbornly opposed to any intelligent reforms in Ireland , and the temper and training of the most influential , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Parliament harm rather than help their cause from year to year . tr . PROSPEROUS IRELAND . Meanwhile , comparatively speaking , Ireland has been lately the most prosperous and progressive section of the United Kingdom . Irishmen who do not meddle in politics or fight landlordism , whatever their private political sentiments may be . have been tilling the few good acres to excellent advantage , and the manufactures and other industries have experienced a notable awakening . Mr. George Wyndham , the Chief Secretary for Ireland . has declared definitely that no compulsory Land bill will be passed by the present Government , but the session is likely to see the usual amount of piffling legislation aimed at the national evil  --  I mean landlordism , not rum  --  and witness the usual obstacles put in its way by the Zlationalists , who would probably oppose the wisest legislation to better Ireland in the same lately taken a new tack , and declare that he was in South Africa only as a newspaper correspondent , but they have been boasting too long of his achievements in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely that he will ever appear at St. Stephen 's . MR . CHAMBERLAIN . In the political wprld , and , indeed , out of it . the hero of the hour is Joseph Chamberlain , who has gained greatly in Public esteem because of the unjust accusations made against him in Germany and on the Continent generally , and who has shown his usual skill in meeting the situation squarely and unflinchingly . He is to get an address in a gold box from the City of London ; which is nothing if not Conservative , and he has quite overshadowed Lord Rosebery in prominence ' in the public prints here and abroad for the last few days . It is Lord Rosebery 's idea that in boasting of the Government 's foreign policy he is spreading the tail of his coat to be walked on , and the noble Lord proceeds to walk on it , but poor as may have been the foreign policy , it is at least a policy to which Lord Rosebery offgrs no alternative , and has no party to carry it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly tempest of Continental fury is subsiding , and lo ! it is Mr. Chamberlain , and not his enemies , who is getting the credit for calming it down . As for the prominence given this international incident by the leading London journals , the unprejudiced observer can not but think it unwise , and it has been well said lately that many German prints . which otherwise had been unheard of out of the immediate neighborhood of their offices , had received a splendid lot of European and American advertising . The London Times has been marshaling this week the insults of the most brutal sort , generally devoid of humor , bestowed on English persons and institutions , more particularly on Victoria and Edward VII. , since the Boer war began , to the amazement ' of people uninformed of the course of malice and spite in Germany . Many of these pictures are really artistic in their way , and much money has been expended in this campaign of hatred .
