txt AT THE PLAYHOUSES . Passing Comment on the Frivolous En4 tertainMents of the Day . It may or it may not be a significant s/gtr of the times that the theatres at which the largest crowds of ? people at the present time are to be found are those in which frivolity reigns . All the serious dramas on exhibition in New York at the present are receiving only a modicum of the patronage which they deserve . The public has elected to like Mr. Hackett 's Don Caesar de Bazan in a ' mild and complacent manner , and his audiences are tolerably large . But there is a large element of comedy in the drama , and though it can not be fairly called a frivolous entertainment , it is at least fantastical and airy . " The Messenger Boy " at Daly 's has imprinted itself upon : the hearts of the populace , and at the Madison Square Theatre there are nightly enacted scenes of strenuous eagerness upon the part of a public determined to see a young woman who disports herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays of the ? species to - which " The Liberty Belles " belongs the exposition of the female form divine is one of the most potent elements of attractiveness with the theatregoer . Suet exactly how this fundamentai truth bears itself-In the presence of pajamas , is difficult to define , but certainly the flowing robes of the East are not favorable to a display of figures . On the contrary , there is a , certain formlessness about the pajama affair which leads to the suspicion that curiosity has been piqued by . the mystery of the present voluminous concealment . The Bitola Theatre is a. palace of discome fort just now to all who have not taken the precaution to procure their seats in advance . Mr. David Warfield is there enacting that Hebrew character which he has for several years utilized . as the vehicle for the revelation of his talents . Not he has a play built around this character , and the populace rejoice and are exceeding glad . Fragmentary and episodical as this production is , it is not without features of real dramatic effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most truly humorous , is that in which Mr. Warfield as the Hebrew bsfcre mentioned , and Marie Bates as the intoxicated Irish woman whom she has played in several plays , sit upon the steps and dispute over the naming of their grandchildren . It may be noted that the father and mother of these prospective grandchildren are not yet born , and that there is ' something of ingenuous speculation in the episode whichonakes it singularly fascinating , even to confirmed bachelors . " The Rogers Brothers , in Washington HI continues to draw crowds at the Knicker. bocker Theatre . There is nothing serious about the diverting spectacle . The Rogers Brothers talk and talk and talk , and the audience laughs and laughs and laughs , and that is the sum of the entire matter . Down at Weber &; Fields 's one may hear conversations of a similar nature . but with three comedians to do the talking . But the fun is not confined to the doings and sayings of Messrs . Weber , Fields , and Bernard . There are the insinuating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hopper says that in New York it is not a man 's beginnings that count , but his finish , he gives a fair sample of the sort of humor out of which the whole entertainment is made . There are a lot of truth and a good deal of sound philosophy in the humorous remarks in the piece , and whatever else one may chose to say of the talk one can not deny that It contains a heap.of sense . Mr. Williams , escaped from the restrictions of the polite drama , and let loose in the sportive domain of Weber-and-Fieldism , is an inspiring sight . He still wears garments of a cut which combines The features of fashion with those of sport , and he still has the air of one to whom recondite knowledge as to what is what is a familiar friend . Mr. Williams also sings and dances . Nimble feet and elastic limbs nature kindly gave to this actor and he has cultivated their use with no little judgment . But in the matter of voice Mr. Will . lams was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he travels along the dizzy brink of disaster with a courage and a nicety of discretion which are altogether admirable . Whatever this performer does is prompted by a pretty appreciation of the lights and shadows of stage craft . In. a word Mr. Williams , even in a hotel ' , potch variety show , continues to be a very ! artistic comedian . Mr. Daniel Daly and Miss - Virginia Earl are again with us The lean and statuesque comedian is amusing in his old way to those who like his sort of humor . Mr. Daly has a fathomless capacity for expressing weariness . No one was ever so tired of livin as he seems to be on the stage with- out shuffling off this mortal coil . He makes one recall the delightful lines of John Brougham in his fascinating burlesque , " Pocahontas . " John Smith remarked , " life 's a conundrum , " to which the chief Powhatan , armed with his ready club ; responded , : " .. rhen lie down and give it up . " As for Miss Earl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the de .. parting , Buttercup , " A plump and pleasing person . "
