txt THE HOOKWORM FUND . Dissents from Bishop Candler 's Opinion of Mr. Rockefeller 's Gift . It seems to me that if Blishop Warren A. Candler were seeking a way to advertise himself as a narrow . uninformed , and prejudiced person , he could have found no surer method of bringing this fact to the attention of the public than by heaping abuse and criticism upon Mr. Rockefeller for giving a million dollars for the Prevention and extermination of disease , and ten millions for education In the South . It is strange that the Bishop did not accuse Mr. Rockefeller of having been the cause of the disease and illiteracy below the Mason and Dixon Line . It is fortunate that in this self-appointed task of criticism that few , if any . will believe that the Bishop expresses the sentiment of the Southern people . The majority of Southerners , as well as Northerners , know that Mr. Rockefeller bases his gifts upon scientific knowledge of facts , and that his gifts are invariably for constructive work and the betterment of mankind .
