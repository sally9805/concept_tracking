txt With one turbulent session that tasten - until the dawn was breaking and ended with the nomination of William Jennings Bryan for President , and a quiet afternoon session that resulted in the nomination of John Worth Kern of Indiana for Vice President , the Democratic National Convention ended its labors to-day . It had completed a ticket that was consistent , at any rate , ror a man twice defeated for the Presidency was at the head of it , and a man twice defeated for Governor of his State was at the tail of it . Only the reluctance of the New York leaders to present a candidate for second place on the Bryan ticket was responsible for the nomination of Mr. Kern . William 3 . Bryan , according to his spokesmen here , since It became certain that Judge Gray of Delaware would not consent to become his running mate , was very anxious to have the New York delegation unite on some conservative Democrat who could lend prestige to the ticket in the East . Place Went Begging . To state facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though there was a superabundance of small fry candidates , who would have been only too happy to accept it . At the session this afternoon the one salient feature in all the speechmaking was the announcement on the part of the men who had been chosen spokesmen of the several States which were heard from that " they had intended to present " such and such a man 's name , but that the candidate had begged that his name be not presented . It was this situation that the managers of the Kern boom used to advantage . They got to work immediately after the word had come authoritatively from Tammany Leader Murphy that New York would have no candidate . The Indiana delegation appointed a committee to promote it . Mr. Kern had exacted one condition from his friends  --  that his name should not go before the convention unless there was reasonable assurance that the required two-thirds vote could be rallied to his support . His boom had been little heard of since the early stage of the preconvention activities . It had been completely eclipsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Judge Gaynor of New York , and John Mitchell , the labor leader . When it became evident that men of this calibre were unwilling to go on the Bryan ticket the Kern boom took a new lease of life . Round-Up By Indiana Men . Thomas Taggart . Chairman of the Democratic National Committee , was the most persistent advocate of Mr. Kern ' nomination , and it was he who engineered the appointment of the boom committee . It was composed of former : Mayor John N. Holtzman of Indianapolis , : Democratic State Chairman 1.1 . S. Jackson . and Congressman Lincoln Dickson .. They were instructed to visit all the delegations . With the Vice Presidential candidates at . a premium , the committee found the outlook good . They worked all night and practically up to the last minute before the convention went into session this aft .. ernoon . At that time they made their report to Mr. Taggart , Roger Sullivan of Illinois , Mayor Brown of Lincoln , and Charles W. Bryan , the Presidential candidate 's brother . These leaders felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was consulted and sent a telegram to his brother in which he dedared that he would be satisfied with Kern or any other candidate who looked good enough to the convention to be its nominee . It should be stated , perhaps , that en route for the convention city Mr. Kern and Chairman Jackson stopped off at Lincoln and had a talk with Mr. Bryan . " Mr. Bryan received us very pleasantly , and said he would be quite delighted to have Mr. Kern for his running mate , " said Mr. Jackson to a correspondent for THE TIMES on his arrival . " But I suppose , " he added somewhat ruefully , " that he told all the other Vice Presidential aspirants the same . " When the delegates gathered at the Auditorium between 1 and 2 o'clock the word had already gone forth that Kern was to be the nominee , but as the leaders had heard the final word from Lincoln only half an hour earlier the fact was not known among the visitors , and there were hopes that there would be a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didates would be presented . Clayton Unable to Preside . Cute James of Kentucky called the convention to order for the last time , Mi. , Clayton of Alabama , the permanent Chairman , suffering from a sore ifiniat ... The session began at 1:50 . Senator Steno of Missouri moved that the nominating speeches be limited to ten tolnutei and the seconding speeches to fiva.rninutea The delegates as well as ' the visit:nu 1124 had enough of oratory during the long night session , and the motion was carried with a roar , the galleries joining In . When the roll of the States for nominations began Alabama gave way to Indiana . That meant Kern , and practically every one knew it . Thomas FL Marshall , the Democratic nominee for Governor in Indiana , mounted the platform , and in a speech that was meant to be stirring and which last night would have created excitement named Mr. Kern . Such demonstration as there was came almost solidly from the Indiana delegation , which paled itself hoarse , but was not able to Loose the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of Charles A. Towne of New York . Such applause as there Was came almost entirely from the galleries . J. J. Walsh of . Connecticut proposed . Archibald Menet11 of Bridgeport , a warm friend of Mr. Bryan . Those who did not know that the oracle of Lincoln had spoken thought he might still have a chance for the nomination . Georgia , through J. T. Hill , placed in nomination Clark Howell , and the delegation made the welkin ring as far as they Were able , but they got very little help . Warm Greeting for Folk . Florida ? yielded to Missouri and Gov. ijoseph Polk went to the platform . He got a greater reception than had been accorded the mention of Kern 's name ; greater , in fact , than any demonstration given during the course of the session . He bowed and smiled , and it was several minutes before he could make himself heard . When quiet was restored he made a brief speech seconding the nomination of Kern which was very well received . Idaho seconded the nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his State had desired to put in nomination John Mitchell . but that the labor leader , whom he praised highly , had refused to accept . Illinois therefore seconded Kern . At this the Indiana delegation yelled So loudly and so long that it became very hoarse indeed . Its turn came next , . and It yielded back to Alabama , which seconded Kern . Iowa followed suit , ' though her spokesman said that it had been the desire of his State to name Jere Sullivan of Des Moines . Kentucky , through 011ie James , joined the Kern . forces . Maryland seconded Towne . Michigan supported Kern . Minnesota , to the surprise of several , seconded Nevada seconded Towne , and then New Hampshire got out its parachute and displayed a Kern sign . New York was called , and there was a buzz of excitement . Charles F. Murphy arose , while the crowd listened . He Quietly announced : " No candidate . " North Dakota , Ohio , and Pennsylvania seconded Kern . As each of these announcements was made there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration . Gray Declination Is Read . Texas created a stir when Thomas Ball said his State would have nominated Judge Gray but for the fact that it had been urgently requested not to . Mr. Handy of Delaware , who placed Gray In nomination last night , read this telegram from the jurist : Do not under any circumstances allow my name to be presented for Vice Presidential Domination , as I would under no circumstances accept the same if nominated . " The Chair recognizes Mr. Towne of New York , " said the Chairman . The break had come . Mr. Towne 's appearance had provoked cheers . He announced his withdrawal and got more cheers . Immediately Hill of . Georgia withdrew the name of Clark Virginia sent to the platform ex-Gov . Is : Hogue Tyler , who made a quiet and eloquent speech . have to present on behalf of my State one of her ? " he began . - Some one ran to the platform and whised to the speaker . He laughed and crowd laughed . Then he said that had understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that he had just been told his State wished to second the nomination of Kern . Virginia had almost missed the parachute . Gov . Haskell of Oklahoma and Gov . Higgins of Rhode Island seconded Kern , and still Connecticut did not withdraw VicNeil . There was some impatience manifested . The nomination could have been made by acclamation half an hour before but for the action of the Nutmeg State . Pledge of New York 's Support . New York asked that it be called , and Daniel F. Cohalan was introduced . " New York . " he said , " came to the convention without a candidate either for the Vice Presidency or the Presidency . We were under instructions from our State Convention to consult with leaders from all parts of the country to see what best might be done for the party . " We are convinced that the voice of the party in no uncertain terms called for the nomination of William Jennings Bryan , and we now feel there is the same call for Mr. Kern . New York therefore desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militant Democracy of the Empire State I desire to pledge our earnest support and to say to you that all that can be done by harmony , intellect , energy , or force to bring about victory in November for our ticket will be done . " Mr. Cohalan 's use of " force " caused a laugh . ' When he concluded he was loudly cheered . Back to the platform after Mr. Cohalan came Mr. Walsh of Connecticut . He withdrew the name of Mr. and the crowd shouted its approval . It was three minutes after 4 when Mr. Walsh stopped . Half a dimen people made the necessary motions at once . The question teas put and carried . John W. Kern of Indiana had been nominated by acclamation . The demonstration the announcement of this got was scarcely worthy of the name . There followe I at once , as the delegates began to leave by dozens and scores , the usual resolutions of thanks , the announcement of the meeting- of the National Committee , and the empowering of that body to fill vacancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put and carried , and the convention was over .
