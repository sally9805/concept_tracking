THE PARTHENON *** Produced by David Widger THE PARTHENON BY WAY OF PAPENDRECHT By F. Hopkinson Smith 1909 " WILYUM ! ..... Wilyum ! ..... WILYUM ! " It was mine host of the Ferry Inn at Cook-ham who was calling , and at the top of his voice  --  and a big-chested voice it was  --  the sound leaping into crescendo as the object of his search remained hidden . Then he turned to me : " He 's somewheres ' round the boat house  --  you ca n't miss him  --  there 's too much of him ! " " Are ye wantin ' me , sor ? " came another shout as I rounded the squat building stuffed with boats  --  literally so  --  bottom , top , and sides . " Yes  --  are you the boatman ? " " I am , sor  --  and bloody sick of me job . Do ye see that wherry shovin ' off  --  the one with the lady in a sweater ? Yes  --  that 's right  --  just slipped under the bridge . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Look at it , sor ! " ( Here he held out his hand , in which lay a half-penny . ) " And me a-washin ' out ' is boat , feedin ' of ' is dog , and keepin ' an eye on ' is togs and ' is ladies  --  and then shoves off and ' ands me this  --  a ' a'penny , sor  --  a ' a'penny  --  from the likes o ' ' im to the likes o ' me ! Damn ' im ! "  --  and away went the coin into the river . " You 'll excuse me , sor , but i could n't choke it down . Is it a punt ye 're lookin ' for ? " The landlord was right  --  there was a good deal of him  --  six feet and an inch , I should think ; straight as an oar , his bared arms swinging free ; waist , thighs , and back tough as a saw-log . To this was added two big blue eyes set in a clean-shaven face bronzed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shamed an ear of corn . I caught , too , the muscles of his chest rounding out his boating shirt , and particularly the muscles of the neck supporting the round head crowned with closely cropped hair  --  evidently a young Englishman of that great middle class which the nation depends upon in an emergency . My inspection also settled any question I might have had as to why he was " William , " and never " Bill , " to those about him . The one thing lacking in his make-up  --  and which only came into view when he turned his head  --  was the upper part of one ear . This was clipped as close as a terrier 's . Again he repeated the question  --  with a deprecatory smile , as if he already regretted his outburst . " Is it a punt ye 're wantin ' , sor ? " " Yes  --  and a man to pole it and look after me while I paint . I had old Norris for the past few years , but I hear he 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other work ? " " Time ! I 'll chuck my job if I do n't . " " No ,  --  you can do both ,  --  Norris did . You can pole me out to where I want to work ; bring me my lunch when you have yours , and come for me at night . You were n't here two years ago  --  were you ? " " No  --  I was with General French . Got this clip outside Kimberly  --  " and he touched his ear . " Been all my life on the river  --  Maidenhead and Bourne 's End mostly  --  and so when my time was up I come home and the boss here put me on . " " A soldier ! I thought so . I see now why you got mad . Wonder you did n't throw that chap into the river . " I am a crank on the happiness one gets from the giving of tips  --  and a half-penny man is the rock bottom of meanness . His face straightened . " Well , we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk back . Got to grin and bear it or lose yer job . Learned that in the Hussahs . I did n't care for his money  --  maybe it was the way he did it that set me goin '  --  as if I was  --  Well  --  let it go ! And it 's a punt ye want ?  --  Yes , sor  --  come and pick it out . " After that it was plain sailing  --  or punting . The picture of that London cad sprawling in the water , which my approval had created in his mind , had done it . And it was early and late too ( there were few visitors that month ) ; down by the Weir below the lock as far as Cliveden ; up the backwater to the Mill  --  William stretched beside me while I worked , or pulling back and forth when a cool bottle  --  beer , of course  --  or a kettle and an alcohol lamp would add to my comfort . ***** Many years of tramping and boating up and down the Thames from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river . I know it as I do my own pocket ( and there is more in that statement than you think  --  especially during regatta week ) . First comes Sonning with its rose gardens and quaint brick bridge ; and then Marlowe with that long stretch of silver bordered by nodding trees and dominated by the robber Inn  --  four shillings and six for a sawdust sandwich ! Then Maidenhead , swarming with boats and city folks after dark ( it is only a step from the landing to any number of curtained sitting-rooms with shaded candles  --  and there be gay times at Maidenhead , let me tell you ! ) . And , between , best of all , lovely Cookham . Here the river , crazy with delight , seems to lose its head and goes meandering about , poking its nose up backwaters , creeping across meadows , flooding limpid shallows , mirroring oaks and willows upside down , surging up as if to sweep away a velvet-shorn lawn , only to pour itself  --  its united self  --  into an open-mouthed lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level stretch beyond . If you want a map giving these vagaries , spill a cup of tea and follow its big and little puddles with their connecting rivulets : ten chances to one it will come out right . All this William and I took in for three unbroken weeks , my usual summer allotment on the Thames . Never was there such a breesy , wholesome companion ; stories of his life in the Veldt ; of his hospital experience over that same ear  --  " The only crack I got , sor , thank God !  --  except bein ' ' alf starved for a week and down two months with the fever  --  " neither of which seemed to have caused him a moment 's inconvenience ; stories of the people living about him and those who came from London with a " ' am sandwidge in a noospaper , and precious little more , " rolled out of him by the hour . And the poise of the man ! When he lay stretched out beside me on the grass while I worked  --  an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs or stretching of arms  --  lay as a big hound does , whose blood and breeding necessitate repose . And we were never separated . First a plunge overboard , and then a pull back for breakfast , and off again with the luncheon tucked under the seat  --  and so on until the sun dropped behind the hills . The only days on which this routine of work and play had to be changed were Sundays and holidays . Then my white umbrella would loom up as large as a circus tent , the usual crowd surging about its doors . As you can not see London for the people , so you can not see the river for boats on these days  --  all sorts of boats  --  wherries , tubs , launches , racing crafts , shells , punts  --  everything that can be poled , pulled , or wobbled , and in each one the invariable combination  --  a man , a girl , and a dog  --  a dog , a girl , and a man . This has been going on for ages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornings William and I have our bath early  --  ahead of the crowd really , who generally arrive two hours after sunrise and keep up the pace until the last train leaves for Paddington . This bath is at the end of one of the teacup spillways , and is called the Weir . There is a plateau , a plunge down some twenty feet into a deep pool , and the usual surroundings of fresh morning air , gay tree-tops , and the splash of cool water sparkling in the sunlight . To-day as my boat grated on the gravel my eyes fell on a young English lord who was holding the centre of the stage in the sunlight . He was dressed from head to foot in a skin-tight suit of underwear which had been cut for him by a Garden-of-Eden tailor . He was just out of the water  --  a straight , well-built , ruddy-skinned fellow  --  every inch a man ! What birth and station had done for him would become apparent when his valet began to hand him his Bond Street outfit . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wriggle about the shoulders , the slip of a buckle , and he was overboard and out again before my lord had discarded his third towel . I fell to thinking . Naked they were equals . That was the way they came into the world and that 's the way they would go out . And yet within the hour my lord would be back to his muffins and silver service , with two flunkies behind his chair , and William would be swabbing out a boat or poling me home through the pond lilies . But why ?  --  I kept asking myself . A totally idiotic and illogical question , of course . Both were of an age ; both would be a joy to a sculptor looking for modern gods with which to imitate the Greek ones . Both were equal in the sight of their Maker . Both had served their country  --  my lord , I learned later , being one of the first to draw a bead on Spion Kop close enough to be of any use  --  and both were honest  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no answer  --  never can be . And yet the picture of the two as they stood glistening in the sunlight continues to rise in my memory , and with it always comes this same query  --  one which will never down  --  Why should there be the difference ? ***** But the summer is moving on apace . There is another Inn and another William  --  or rather , there was one several hundred years ago before he went off crusading . It is an old resort of mine . Seven years now has old Leah filled my breakfast cup with a coffee that deserves a hymn of praise in its honor . I like it hot  --  boiling , blistering hot , and the old woman brings it on the run , her white sabots clattering across the flower-smothered courtyard . During all these years I have followed with reverent fingers not only the slopes of its roof but the loops of swinging clematis that crowd its balconies and gabies as well . I say " my " because I have known this Inn of William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many good ones I frequent over Europe  --  the Bellevue , for instance , at Dordrecht , over against Papendrecht ( I shall be there in another month ) . And the Britannia in Venice , and I hope still a third in unknown Athens  --  unknown to me  --  my objective point this year . This particular Inn with the roof and the clematis , is at Dives , twenty miles from Trouville on the coast . You never saw anything like it , and you never will again . I hold no brief for my old friend Le Remois , the proprietor , but the coffee is not the only thing over which grateful men chant hymns . There is a kitchen , resplendent in polished brass , with three French chefs in attendance , and a two-century-old spit for roasting . There is the wine-cellar , in which cobwebs and not labels record the age and the vintage ; there is a dining-room  --  three of them  --  with baronial fireplaces , sixteenth-century furniture , and linen and glass to match  --  to say nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivories , and pewter  --  the whole a sight to turn bric-a-brac fiends into burglars  --  not a difficult thing by the way  --  and then , of course  --  there is the bill ! " Where have you been , M. Le Remois ? " asked a charming woman . " To church , Madame . " " Did you say your prayers ? " " Yes , Madame , " answered this good boni-face , with a twinkle . " What did you pray for ? " " I said  --  ' Oh , Lord !  --  do not make me rich , but place me next to the rich ' "  --  and he kept on his way rubbing his hands and chuckling . And yet I must say it is worth the price . I have no need of a William here  --  nor of anybody else . The water for my cups is within my reach ; convenient umbrellas on movable pedestals can be shoved into place ; a sheltered back porch hives for the night all my paraphernalia and unfinished sketches , and a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobster fresh from the sea and a peculiar peach ablaze in a peculiar sauce  --  the whole washed down by a pint of  --  ( No  --  you ca n't have the brand  --  there were only seven bottles left when I paid my bill )  --  and besides I am going back  --  help to ease the cares that beset a painter 's life . But even this oasis of a garden , hemmed about as if by the froth of Trouville and the suds of Cabourg ; through which floats the gay life of Paris resplendent in toilets never excelled or exceeded anywhere  --  can not keep me from Holland very long . And it is a pity too , for of late years I have been looked upon as a harmless fixture at the Inn  --  so much so that men and women pass and repass my easel , or look over my shoulder while I work without a break in their confidences  --  quite as if I was a deaf , dumb , and blind waiter , or twin-brother to old Coco the cockatoo , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past thirty years . None of these unconscious ear-droppings am I going to betray  --  delightful , startling  --  improper , if you must have it  --  as some of them were . Not the most interesting , at all events , for I promised her I would n't  --  but there is no question as to the diversion obtained by keeping the latch-string of your ears on the outside . None of all this ever drips into my auricles in Holland . A country so small that they build dikes to keep the inhabitants from being spilt off the edge , is hardly the place for a scandal  --  certainly not in stolid Dordrecht or in that fly-speck of a Papendrecht , whose dormer windows peer over the edge of the dike as if in mortal fear of another inundation . And yet , small as it is , it is still big enough for me to approach it  --  the fly-speck , of course  --  by half a dozen different routes . I can come by boat from Rotterdam . Fop Smit owns and runs it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  or by train from Amsterdam ; or by carriage from any number of ' dams , ' drechts , and ' bergs . Or I can tramp it on foot , or be wheeled in on a dog-wagon . I have tried them all , and know . Being now a staid old painter and past such foolishness , I take the train . Toot ! Toot !  --  and I am out on the platform , through the door of the station and aboard the one-horse tram that wiggles and swings over the cobble-scoured streets of Dordrecht , and so on to the Bellevue . Why I stop at the Bellevue ( apart from it being one of my Inns ) is that from its windows I can not only watch the life of the tawny-colored , boat-crowded Maas , but see every curl of smoke that mounts from the chimneys of Papendrecht strung along its opposite bank . My dear friend , Herr Boudier , of years gone by , has retired from its ownership , but his successor , Herr Teitsma , is as hearty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled his last oar some two years back , and one " Bop " takes his place . There is another " p " and an " e " tacked on to Bop , but I have eliminated the unnecessary and call him " Bob " for short . They made Bob out of what was left of Peter , but they left out all trace of William . This wooden-shod curiosity is anywhere from seventy to one hundred and fifty years old , gray , knock-kneed , bent in the back , and goes to sleep standing up  --  and stays asleep . He is the exact duplicate of the tramp in the comic opera of " Miss Hook of Holland "  --  except that the actor-sleeper occasionally topples over and has to be braced up . Bob is past-master of the art and goes it alone , without propping of any kind . He is the only man in Dordrecht , or Papendrecht , or the country round about , who can pull a boat and speak English . He says so , and I am forced not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants it in advance , too  --  having had some experience with " painter-man , " he explains to Herr Teitsma . I shall , of course , miss my delightful William , but I am accustomed to that . And , then , again , while Bob asleep is an interesting physiological study , Bob awake adds to the gayety of nations , samples of which crowd about my easel , Holland being one of the main highways of the earth . I have known Dort and the little ' drecht across the way for some fifteen years , five of which have slipped by since I last opened my umbrella along its quaint quays . To my great joy nothing has changed . The old potato boat still lies close to the quay , under the overhanging elms . The same dear old man and his equally dear old wife still make their home beneath its hipped roof . I know , for it is here I lunch , the cargo forming the chief dish , followed by a saucer of stewed currants , a cup of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread from the baker 's . The old Groote Kirk still towers aloft  --  the highest building in Holland , they say ; the lazy , red-sailed luggers drift up and down , their decks gay with potted plants ; swiss curtains at the cabin windows , the wife holding the tiller while the man trims the sail . The boys still clatter over the polished cobbles  --  an aggressive mob when school lets out  --  and a larger crop , I think , than in the years gone by , and with more noise  --  my umbrella being the target . Often a spoilt fish or half a last week 's cabbage comes my way , whereupon Bob awakes to instant action with a consequent scattering , the bravest and most agile making faces from behind wharf spiles and corners . Peter used to build a fence of oars around me to keep them off , but Bob takes it out in swearing . Only once did he silence them . They were full grown , this squad , and had crowded the old man against a tree under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There came a blow straight from the shoulder , a sprawling boy , and Bob was in the midst of them , his right sleeve rolled up , showing a full-rigged ship tattooed in India ink . What poured from him I learned afterward was an account of his many voyages to the Arctic and around the Horn , as the label on his arm proved  --  an experience which , he shouted , would be utilized in pounding them up into fish bait if they did not take to their heels . After that he always went to sleep with one eye open , the boys keeping awake with two  --  and out of my way  --  a result which interested me the more . If my Luigi was not growing restless in my beloved Venice ( it is wonderful how large a portion of the earth I own ) I would love to pass the rest of my summer along these gray canals , especially since Bob 's development brings a daily surprise . Only to-day I caught sight of him half hidden in an angle of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were begging him for paper pin-wheels which a vender had stopped to sell , an infinitesimal small coin the size of a cuff button purchasing a dozen or more . When I again looked up from a canvas each tot had a pin-wheel , and later on Bob , that much poorer in pocket , sneaked back and promptly went to sleep . But even Bob 's future beatification can not hold me . I yearn for the white , blinding light and breathless lagoons , and all that makes Venice the Queen City of the World . Luigi meets me inside the station . It takes a soldo to get in , and Luigi has but few of them , but he is always there . His gondola is moored to the landing steps outside  --  a black swan of a boat , all morocco cushions and silk fringes ; the product of a thousand years of tinkering by the most fastidious and luxurious people of ancient or modern times , and still to-day the most comfortable conveyance known to man . ' Hurry up , you who have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuggity-chug is forcing its way up every crooked canal , no matter how narrow . Two Venetian shipyards are hammering away on their hulls or polishing their motors . Soon the cost of production will drop to that of a gondola . Then look out ! There are eight thousand machinists in the Arsenal earning but five francs a day , any one of whom can learn to run a motor boat in a week , thus doubling their wages . Worse yet  --  the world is getting keener every hour for speedy things . I may be wrong  --  I hope and pray I am  --  but it seems to me that the handwriting is already on the wall . " This way to the Museo Civico , " it reads  --  " if you want to find a gondola of twenty-five years ago . " As for the Luigis and the Esperos  --  they will then have given up the unequal struggle . The only hope rests with the Venetians themselves . They have restored the scarred Library , and are rebuilding the Campanile , with a reverence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect of the artistic world . The gondola is as much a part of Venice as its sunsets , pigeons , and palaces . Let them by special license keep the Tragfaetti intact , with their shuttles of gondolas crossing bade and forth  --  then , perhaps , the catastrophe may be deferred for a few decades . ***** As it was in Dort and Papendrecht so it is in Venice . Except these beastly , vile-smelling boats there is nothing new , thank God . Everything else is faded , weather-worn , and old , everything filled with sensuous beauty  --  sky , earth , lagoon , garden wall , murmuring ripples  --  the same wonderful Venice that thrills its lovers the world over . And the old painters are still here  --  Walter Brown , Bunce , Bompard , Faulkner , and the rest  --  successors of Ziem and Rico  --  men who have loved her all their lives . And with them a new band of devotees  --  Monet and Louis Aston Knight among them . " For a few days , " they said in explanation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return , I predict , as Jong as they can hold a brush . As for Luigi and me  --  we keep on our accustomed way , leading our accustomed lives . Seventeen years now since he bent to his oar behind my cushions  --  twenty-six in all since I began to idle about her canals . It is either the little canal next the Public Garden , or up the Giudecca , or under the bronze horses of San Marco ; or it may be we are camped out in the Piazzetta before the Porta della Carta ; or perhaps up the narrow canal of San Rocco , or in the Fruit Market near the Rialto while the boats unload their cargoes . All old subjects and yet ever new ; each has been painted a thousand times , and in as many different lights and perspectives . And yet each canvas differs from its fellows as do two ripples or two morning skies . For weeks we drift about . One day Carlotta , the fishwife up the Fondamenta della Pallada , makes us our coffee ; the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This with a roll , a bit of Gorgonzola , and a bunch of grapes , or half a dozen figs , is our luncheon , to which is added two curls of blue smoke , one from Luigi 's pipe and the other from my cigarette . Then we fall to work again . But this will never do ! While I have been loafing with Luigi not only has the summer slipped away , but the cool winds of October have crept down from the Alps . There are fresh subjects to tackle  --  some I have never seen . Athens beckons to me . The columns of the Parthenon loom up ! ***** If there are half a dozen ways of getting into Papendrecht  --  there is only one of reaching Athens  --  that is , if you start from Venice . Trieste first , either by rail or boat , and then aboard one of the Austrian Lloyds , and so on down the Adriatic to Patras . It is October , remember  --  when every spear of grass from a six months ' drought  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will rain to-morrow , or next week , they will tell you  --  but it does n't  --  never has in October  --  and never will . Strange to say , you never miss it  --  neither in the color of the mountains flanking the Adriatic or in any of the ports on the way down , or in Patras itself . The green note to which I have been accustomed  --  which I have labored over all my life  --  is lacking , and a new palette takes its place  --  of mauve , violet , indescribable blues , and evanescent soap-bubble reds . The slopes of the hills are mother-of-pearl , their tops melting into cloud shadows so delicate in tone that you can not distinguish where one leaves off and the other begins . And it is so in Patras , except for a riotous , defiant pine  --  green as a spring cabbage or a newly painted shutter  --  that sucks its moisture from nobody knows where  --  has n't any , perhaps , and glories in its shame . All along the railroad from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same  --  bare fields , bare hills , streets and roads choked with dust . And so , too , when you arrive at the station and take the omnibus for the Grand Bretagne . By this time you are accustomed to it  --  in fact you rather enjoy it . If you have a doubt of it , step out on the balcony at the front of the hotel and look up ! Hanging in the sky  --  in an air of pure ether , set in films of silver grays in which shimmer millions of tones , delicate as the shadings of a pearl , towers the Acropolis , its crest fringed by the ruins of the greatest temples the world possesses . I rang a bell . " Get me a carriage and send me up a guide  --  anybody who can speak English and who is big enough to carry a sketch trap . " He must have been outside , so quickly did he answer the call . He was two-thirds the size of William , one-half the length of Luigi , and one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Vlassopoulos . " " Anything else ? " " Yes  --  Panis . " " Then we 'll drop the last half . Put those traps in the carriage  --  and take me to the Parthenon . " I never left it for fourteen consecutive days  --  nor did I see a square inch of Athens other than the streets I drove through up and back on my way to work . Nor have I in all my experience ever had a more competent , obliging , and companionable guide  --  always excepting my beloved Luigi , who is not only my guide , but my protector and friend as well . It was then that I blessed the dust . Green things , wet things , soggy things  --  such as mud and dull skies  --  have no place in the scheme of the Parthenon and its contiguous temples and ruins . That wonderful tea-rose marble , with its stains of burnt sienna marking the flutings of endless broken columns , needs no varnishing of moisture to enhance its beauty . That will do for the facade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moss-encrusted tower of the Groote Kirk , but never here . It was this fear , perhaps , that kept me at work , haunted as I was by the bogy of " Rain to-morrow . It always comes , and keeps on for a month when it starts in . " Blessed be the weather clerk ! It never started in  --  not until I reached Brindisi on my way back to Paris ; then , if I remember , there was some falling weather  --  at the rate of two inches an hour . And yet I might as well confess that my fourteen days of consecutive study of the Acropolis , beginning at the recently uncovered entrance gate and ending in the Museum behind the Parthenon , added nothing to my previous historical or other knowledge  --  meagre as it had been . Where the Venetians wrought the greatest havoc , how many and what columns were thrown down ; how high and thick and massive they were ; what parts of the marvellous ruin that High Robber Chief Lord Elgin stole and carted off to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence " ; how wide and long and spacious was the superb chamber that held the statue the gods loved  --  none of these things interested me  --  do not now . What I saw was an epoch in stone ; a chronicle telling the story of civilization ; a glove thrown down to posterity , challenging the competition of the world . And with this came a feeling of reverence so profound , so awe-inspiring , so humbling , that I caught myself speaking to Panis in whispers  --  as one does in a temple when the service is in progress . This , as the sun sped its course and the purple shadows of the coming night began to creep up the steps and columns of the marvellous pile , its pediment bathed in the rose-glow of the fading day , was followed by a silence that neither of us cared to break . For then the wondrous temple took on the semblance of some old sage , the sunlight on his forehead , the shadow of the future about his knees .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
