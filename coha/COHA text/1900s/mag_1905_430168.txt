 |p915  JAPAN has given the world many surprises since she entered upon her " era of enlightenment " and began to adopt the methods and appliances of Western civilization ; but it may well be doubted whether , in all the long list of her achievements and triumphs , anything is more extraordinary and astonishing than her rapid creation of a navy and her wonderful exhibition of fighting capacity in the field of naval warfare . If , twenty years ago , Captain Mahan had ventured to predict that an Asiatic people ? a people almost universally regarded as semi-barbarous ? would shortly have a navy of the first rank , would completely crush the sea power of one of the greatest States in Europe , and would produce a naval commander worthy to take rank with Nelson , his prediction would have been regarded as too wild and absurd for discussion . People would have said , " Preposterous ! The Chinese and Japanese , only thirty years ago , were going to war in high-sterned wooden junks propelled by sails . How are they going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare , and produce a commander like Nelson , in a single generation ? The most gifted and civilized nation in Europe could not do it . It 's a long step from gongs , firecrackers , and wooden junks to high-powered guns and armored battle-ships ; and as for a commander worthy to take rank with Nelson ? you might as well look to Asia for a yellowskinned Napoleon ! " Such a judgment as this in 1885 would have been regarded as reasonable and conclusive by nine Americans out of ten ; ad yet , at that very time , the Japanese navy was in process of creation ; Japanese naval officers were learning in England and Germany how to make highpowered guns ; and the Asiatic Nelson , after seven years of training in Great Britain , was serving as a lieutenant in the Japanese cruiser Asama . How quickly the Asiatic islanders assimilated the knowledge that the Occident could give them , and how thoroughly and effectively they put it into practice , we may see from a brief review of the results of the present war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly created navy of this small Asiatic empire , with some cooperation from the army at Port Arthur , has sunk or captured sixty-five Russian vessels , including fourteen battle-ships of the first class , twelve armored or protected cruisers , four auxiliary cruisers , three coast-defense ironclads , eleven gunboats , and twenty-one torpedo-boats and destroyers . It has also killed or captured eleven Russian admirals , and has taken as prisoners about ten thousand men of the naval rank and file . It has not suffered a single defeat , and although twelve of its vessels have been destroyed by accidental collisions and percussion mines , it has not lost , in action , a single ship larger than a torpedo-boat , and it is probably stronger and more efficient now than it was a year ago . Such a record as this is not only extraordinary , but absolutely unparalleled ; and when we consider the fact that these results have been attained , not by accident or luck , but by organization , practice , good judgment , and consummate skill , we must give Japan credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval commanders worthy to take rank with the first in the world . Among the men who have been identified with the Japanese navy from the very beginning , who have been most active in its training , and who have contributed most to its efficiency , is the distinguished admiral whose name stands at the head of this article . Other officers , perhaps , have had more influence in shaping the maritime policy of Japan , in creating her fleet , and in perfecting her naval organization ; but Togo , Kamimura , Uriu , Kataoka , Shimamura , and Dewa have given to the men of the navy  |p916  the training that has made them so efficient , and Togo has directed the operations that have finally resulted in the destruction of the Baltic fleet and the almost complete annihilation of Russia 's sea power . In view of the extraordinary achievements that have marked his career , and the influence of his latest victory in determining the future of the Far East , one naturally inquires , " Who is Togo ? From what stock does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what were the influences that formed his character and made him the great naval commander that he is ? " Materials for a full and satisfactory biography of Admiral Togo do not exist ? or , at ' least , have not been collected ? but it is my purpose to bring together in this article such facts as I have been able to learn , and to describe the personal impression that the Admiral made upon me when I saw him first , on his flag-ship the Mikasa , off the coast of southern Manchuria in the summer of 1904 . At the time of Togo 's birth the Empire of Japan had , nominally , two rulers , viz. , the Mikado and the Shogun . Although the former was theoretically the head of the nation , the whole power of the State was practically in the hands of the Shogun , or generalissimo of the forces , who acted in the Mikado 's name , but , as a rule , without any regard to the latter 's wishes . The organization of society was feudal in form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each of which took the name of the province that it occupied . The feudal lords at the head of these clans were called " daimyos , " and every daimyo had a standing force of armed retainers known as " samurai , " who assisted him in the government of his province , fought for him when necessary , and looked to him for equipment and maintenance . The daimyos and their retainers were supported by the peasant farmers , who had no political rights and who were virtually serfs . Among the most warlike and powerful of the clans that rendered allegiance to the Shoguns of the Tokugawa family , in the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries , was the clan of Satsuma , which inhabited a comparatively small mountainous promontory at the southern end of the island of Kyushiu , fifty or sixty miles from the city of Nagasaki . Heihachiro Togo , the subject of the present sketch , was born at Kagoshima , in the province of Satsuma , on the 22d of December , 1847 , five years and and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter into commercial relations with the United States . His father , Kichiizaemon Togo , was a trusted samurai in the service of Prince Shimadzu , the feudal lord of Satsuma ; and his mother , who is said to have been an educated woman of character and much ability , was a descendant of Kiyomori , the head of the great feudal house of Taira . Inasmuch as Kichizaemon Togo , the father , was local governor of the district in which he lived , and received a yearly allowance of five hundred bushels of rice from his feudal lord , the family had a good social position , and , according to the standard of that time , was well-to-do With regard to the early boyhood of Heihachiro Togo little is known . Until he was twelve years of age he seems to have had no instruction other than that which his mother could give him ; but in 1859 or 1860 he became a pupil of a very distinguished samurai of Satsuma , who is known in Japanese history as Takemori Saigo . Although Saigo was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreigners and the adoption of Western civilization , he seems to have been a sincere patriot and a man of pure and upright character ; and he exercised , throughout his life , a strong influence upon the whole Togo family . In the period of disorder that preceded the abolition of the Shogunate and the restoration of the Mikado , he fought on the Imperial side , and eventually became commander-in-chief of the Emperor 's armies ; but when , in 1877 , it became apparent that the Mikado 's Government intended to pursue a Europeanizing policy , Saigo broke off relations with his colleagues and headed the clansmen of Satsuma in a vigorous protest , which eventually took the form of armed resistance , and culminated in the civil war known as the " Satsuma  |p917  Rebellion . " After a fierce and sanguinary struggle of eight or nine months , the rebels were defeated in a decisive battle , on the 27th of September , 1877 , and the town of Kagoshima was destroyed by firee . Two of Admiral . Togo 's brothers and five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saigo himself , seeing that all was lost , committed suicide in a cave just back of the town . Such were the character and the career of Admiral Togo 's first teacher . For a period of about four years ? 1859 to 1862 ? young Togo studied , under the direction of Saigo , all the branches of knowledge and all the accomplishments which were taught in Japan at that time ; viz. , ideographic penmanship , the Chinese classics , fencing , jiu-jitsu wrestling , and military exercises with sword , halberd , and gun . Friends of the family , who remember him as a boy , say that he was a diligent student , and that among the boisterous and turbulent youth of Satsuma he was distinguished for modesty and quiet seriousness of demeanor ; but no one who knew him gave him credit for anything more than ordinary ability . Saigo 's strong personality doubtless made a deep and permanent impression upon his character , and among the precepts of the teacher that are still remembered , and that seem to have influenced the pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see faults , take the blame of them yourself ; where there is merit , attribute it to others . Act resolutely , and the very gods and devils shall flee before you . " In Togo 's official report of the battle of , the Japan Sea there is hardly a referece to his own personal action or management , and when I once asked the captain of the Japanese battle-ship Asahi what was the Admiral 's distinguishing characteristic , he replied , in Russian , On ochen reshitelni " ( He is very resolute ) . Among Togo 's youthful friends and associates at Kagoshima was another Satsuma boy , who was also a pupil of Saigo , and who has since become known to the world as General Kuroki , the commander of Marshal Oyama 's First Army . Togo and Kuroki studied together and played together for a period of about four years , and then , leaving their teacher Saigo , they both entered upon a military career , Togo as naval apprentice on one of Prince Shimadzu 's war-ships , and Kuroki as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was destined to see active service very early in life . On the 14th of September , 1862 , after Yokohama had been made an open port and foreigners had settled there , Prince Shimadzu , the daimyo of Satsuma , happened to be traveling in state , with a large armed retinue , along the Tokaido ? the imperial highway which connects Tokyo with Kyoto . A short distance from Yokohama , near the post-station of Kanagawa , a small party of English residents , including one lady , got in the way of the procession by which the daimyo was attended . The retainers of the Prince , regarding the behavior of the Englishmen as disrespectful to their lord , drew their swords and attacked the party with great ferocity , and in the affray that followed , C. L. Richardson was killed . The British Government at once demanded reparation and indemnity . The daimyo of Satsuma replied defiantly that Richardson and his associates , " having been guilty of rudeness , had been punished in accordance with the laws of the Empire , and that , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Failing to get satisfaction , the British Government finally sent Admiral Kuper , with seven war-ships , to punish Prince Shimadzu for his contumacy ; and on the 15th of August , 1863 , the fleet bombarded Kagoshima , where Togo , then a lad of seventeen , was serving in one of the forts . The fight that ensued is described by a contemporary Japanese historian as follows : " On the morning of the 15th of August , when the men-of-war advanced , the Satsuma clansmen could not restrain their ardor and impatience . The rain and wind were very violent this day , which they looked upon as a special favor from heaven , and joyfully therefore they fired several shots from the batteries which lined the shore . The barbarian vessels fired several shots and engaged . The combat lasted the whole day , and the Shinsei kuan was burnt by the  |p918  shells fired from the barbarian ships . Although the Satsuma clan thus lost many killed and wounded , the ships were terribly knocked about by their fire , and two persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides these , the enemy lost more than sixty killed and wounded . The Satsuma clan became more and more enthusiastic . All the intrepid samurai of the province hastened to the spot , and exhausted their efforts in pouring forth an unceasing fire . The noise of the cannon re-echoed among the hills and valleys , and the sea seemed to boil over . The land and the sea strove together like a couple of bulls , until the robber vessels , unable to endure it any longer , were entirely defeated , and fled in disorder to the ocean . " Whether Midshipman Togo distinguished himself in this engagement or not , the historian fails to state ; but it is fair to presume that he fought with courage and intelligence , as a good samurai should . The gun-practice and the tactics of the British ships probably made a strong impression upon him , and it is not at all unlikely that his resolution to go to England , for the purpose of studying naval science , was formed at this time and as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no other opportunity of seeing British war-ships in action . Between 1863 and 1869 Togo seems to have served as a midshipman on one of the Satsuma war-ships ; but with regard to this part of his life very little is known . In the struggle for supremacy between the Shogun and the Mikado the clan of Satsuma took the side of the latter , and Togo 's ship , the Kasuga , participated in a number of engagements with the Shogun 's fleet . In a fierce naval battle off Hakodate , in 1869 , one of the Imperial ships ? the Taibo was so cut up by the enemy 's fire that she withdrew from the fighting line . Togo , then a young officer of twenty-two , was so filled with indignation at the sight of the Taibo 's retreat that he shook his fist at the withdrawing vessel and shouted " in a voice of thunder , " " O you coward i " His brother officers still remember this denunciation , and often refer to it as Togo 's thundering against the ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended and peace was restored under the rule of the Mikado , Togo returned to Tokyo . His determination to complete his naval education in England had by this time become stronger than ever , and at the first opportunity he went to Yokohama to live , and began there the study of the English language . He had to content himself at first with such help as he could get from the British soldiers who guarded the foreign concession ; but he finally made the acquaintance of a teacher named Wackman , or Wakeman , who gave him regular instruction . Meanwhile he asked the Government repeatedly to send him as a naval student to Great Britain , and finally begged the intercession and assistance of Okubo , the Minister of Home Affairs , who was a Satsuma man and who might be expected to take some interest in an ambitious student of his own clan . So anxious did Togo feel with regard to the outcome of his application that , according to his fellow-students , he even consulted a Japanese fortune-teller . In March , 1871 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain to study naval science , and among them were Heihachiro Togo , now commander-in-chief of the Japanese navy , and Tosuke Harada , the present superintendent of the Japanese naval arsenal . Togo was then a little more than twenty-three years of age . Before they embarked for Southampton the students decided to put on European dress , but as there were few European shops in Yokohama at that time , the young men had to wear such clothes as they could pick up , and it is said that when they went on board the steamer in ill-fitting , slop-chest coats and trousers , and worn , second-hand boots , they presented a laughable if not ridiculolls appearance . With regard to Togo 's life in England there is , again , an almost complete lack of information . All we definitely know is that , after an unsuccessful attempt to get admission to the Thames Naval Academy , he became a cadet on the training-ship Worcester , at Plymouth . That  |p919  vessel is still in commission , and on the occasion of the presentation of the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wales last year , Captain Henderson Smith , who commanded her thirty years ago , happened to be present . Speaking of the Japanese admiral , he said : " Togo was an excellent fellow . He was not what you would call brilliant , but a great plodder , slow to learn , but very sure when he had learnt ; and he wanted to learn everything ! He was a quiet , good-tempered young fellow , and as brave as a lion . You know what English boys are ; they used to tease him unmercifully and call him ' Johnny Chinaman . ' When he got tired of that , he would quietly put his books on one side and say , No , I am not a Chinaman , and I will break the bones of any one who says so again . ' Then he would raise his arm , and my youngsters would bolt . They knew how strong he was , and did not tease him beyond endurance . He was one of the best sailors the Worcester has ever turned out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have trained the greatest admiral in the Far East . " Togo must have made satisfactory progress in his studies , for his Government , on receipt of his first year 's record , appointed him sub-lieutenant in the Imperial navy . It is a noteworthy fact that none of the people who knew Togo in the earlier part of his life gave him credit for talent or for exceptional ability of any kind . His fellow-townsmen in Kagoshima described him merely as a modest , diligent student ; Wakeman , his English teacher in Yokohama , said that he was " a quiet , honest student , but would never make any mark ; " and Captain Smith , of the training-ship Worcester , could find nothing better to say of him than that he was " a great plodder , slow to learn , but very sure when he had learnt . " The judgment of his contemporaries was doubtless accurate , so far as it went , but it failed to take fully into account that backbone of manhood ? character ; and in the serious business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important than intellectual brilliancy alone . When Togo returned to Japan , on the newly built Japanese cruiser Hiyei , in May , 1878. he was a man thirty years of age , and the outlines of his character had taken definite and final shape . He was modest , brave , thoughtful , painstaking , and resolute , and he knew as much of naval science , in theory and in practice , as Great Britain could teach him . Although he rose steadily in his profession after his return from England , he did not reach the rank of captain until 1890 , when he was appointed to command the Amagi . Two or three years later he was transferred to the Naniwo , a larger and more powerful vessel , and in her he made a voyage to the Sandwich Islands . At the outbreak of the Japan-China war , in 1894 , he was already forty-seven years of age ; but his name was wholly unknown abroad , and his career had attracted little attention at home . He had discharged faithfully all the duties assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prudent and capable officer ; but the people of Japan , in general , knew as little about him as the people of the United States knew about U. S. Grant at the beginning of the American civil war . The act that gave him a national reputation was the sinking of the Chinese transport Kowshing . On the 25th of July , 1894 , the cruiser Naniwo , under Togo 's command , overhauled the transport Kowshing on her way to Korea with eleven hundred Chinese troops and fourteen guns . Stopping her by firing a blank cartridge or two , Togo sent a boat off to her , and , after examining her papers and discovering that she had a British registry , he ordered her to follow the Naniwo . Captain Galsworthy , the Englishman in command of the transport , prepared to obey this order ; but the Chinese officers and soldiers overpowered him , took possession of the ship , and refused to surrender . Togo then sent a second boat , with directions to bring away the Kowshing 's European officers ; but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , and still maintained a defiant attitude , Togo opened fire on the transport , and sunk her in about twenty minutes . Most of her European  |p920  officers , including the captain , were picked up by the Naniwo 's boats ; but all ? or nearly all ? of the Chinese perished . This was the first blow struck in the Japan-China war , and it made Togo 's name known to the whole Japanese nation . In the subsequent fighting off the mouth of the Yalu , at Port Arthur , and at Weihaiwei , Togo greatly distinguished himself , and in February , 1895 , he was promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral . At the close of the war the Emperor conferred upon him the order of the Rising Sun , and shortly afterward made him commander-in-chief of the Standing Squadron . When Japan was compelled , by the pressure of Russia , Germany , and France , to surrender all the fruits of her victory , and to withdraw from the Asiatic mainland , it became apparent to Japanese statesmen that they would soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea and China , if not for their own national existence ; and they proceeded to make every possible preparation for the impending conflict . Appreciating the fact that they could not carry on military operations in Korea or Manchuria without retaining command of the sea , they devoted particular attention to their navy ; and since they were not in a condition , financially , to spend as much money as Russia could spend in the construction of new ships , they decided to increase , as far as practicable , the power and efficiency of those that they had . Who first conceived the idea of practicing incessantly with heavy guns at very long ranges , and in all conditions of sea and weather , I do not know ; but it was the skill thus acquired that gave the Japanese navy its pre-eminence , and to Togo and his associates the credit is probably due . In Europe and America naval officers were then practicing at fixed targets , in smooth water , and at an average range of two thousand yards . The Japanese reasoned , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving target , in all conditions of wind and weather , at a distance of four or five thousand yards , they would have a great advantage , and they began at once to practice high-angle fire at ranges varying from two and a half to five miles . An officer of the battle-ship Fuji told me that , a year ago , his gunners could strike the target almost every time at a range of four thousand meters , and , under favorable conditions , could make a good percentage of hits at twice that distance , viz. , five miles . It will readily be seen that this acquired skill practically doubled the efficiency of the Japanese ships , and when the Russians came into collision with them , they ( the Russians ) were overwhelmed and disabled by accuracte gun practice long before they themselves could get near enough to make their own fire effective . This was particularly noticeable in the Battle of the Japan Sea . Admiral Rojesvensky 's most powerful ships were disabled and virtually put out of action at distances ranging from three to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan-China campaign , and in the training and discipline of the navy afterward , made him so conspicuous a figure that , when war with Russia was decided upon , he was promoted to the rank of full Admiral , and was appointed Commanderin-Chief of the combined fleets . The record that he has since made is so well known that I need not review it . I met Admiral Togo , for the first time . in the summer of 1904 , when the Manshumaru visited the Elliott Islands , off the coast of the Liaotung peninsula , and her passengers were given a reception on board the Mikasa , the flag-ship of the Japanese fleet . He came into the wardroom , where we were assembled , and Captain Takarabe , of the Manshumaru. presented us to him with the words . " Gentlemen : Admiral Togo ! " We all sprang to our feet and bowed low to a rather small , compactly built man , fiftyfive or sixty years of age , dressed in a simple uniform of white duck , which bore no other insignia of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was apparently about five feet three inches in height , weighed perhaps one hundred and forty pounds , and had an upright figure and good carriage . His well-shaped head was covered with close-cropped black hair , sprinkled a little with gray ; his small mustache and rather scanty beard had also begun to turn  |p921  gray ; and the pleasant smile with which he responded to our greeting revealed small , slightly defective teeth . His personal bearing was quiet and modest , and it seemed to me that he was somewhat embarrassed by the scrutiny to which he was subjected . His face , however , like the faces of Japanese generally , gave little expression to his emotions , and even when the foreign newspaper correspondents , without preamble or permission , began taking snap-shots at him with their kodaks across the ward-room table , he showed no sign of the annoyance that he must have felt . The photographers were , for the time being , his guests , and Japanese courtesy does not permit a host to rebuke rudeness on the part of gentlemen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much whether an American Admiral would have allowed half a dozen foreign newspaper men to photograph him in the ward-room of his own flag-ship , without even paying him respect enough to ask his permission . When Captain Takarabe presented me personally to the Admiral , the thought that he would probably class me among the men who were capable of taking such photographic liberties with him deprived me of most of my own self-possession , and I could only inquire , in a hesitating , shamefaced way , how he could maintain an effective blockade of Port Arthur at a distance of sixty miles from the mouth of the harbor . He replied pleasantly that this long-range blockade had been made possible by the invention of wireless telegraphy . " The channel , " he said , " is so obstructed that it takes the Russian ships five or six hours to get out . Our scouting boats watch them night and day , and as soon as they make a move it is reported to us by wireless telegraphy . We then have plenty of time to intercept them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way at five o'clock in the morning , but it was eleven before they had cleared a passage through the mine fields and gained the open sea . By that time we were there ready to receive them . " The Admiral spoke English correctly and with a good accent , but he often hesitated for words , and it was evident that he had had little practice in the use of the English language since leaving the training-ship Worcester . After twenty minutes of introductions and conversation , champagne was brought , and Admiral Togo drank to the health of his guests . We , officers and passengers of the Manshumaru , then drank his health , and gave him three English " hurrahs " as he retired from the ward-room . With regard to Admiral Togo 's private life little need be said . He married , in 1882 or 1883 , a daughter of Viscount Kaiyeda , and he has two sons and a daughter . When he is at home he lives simply , in an unpretentious house in Tokyo , and devotes his leisure hours to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , hates receptions and crowds , and would rather grow chrysanthemums in his little garden than receive the thanks and plaudits of a grateful , enthusiastic , and admiring people . In his profession Admiral Togo shows the characteristics that were noticeable in his early manhood and that have shaped his whole career ; viz. , great capacity for work , thoroughness in preparation , unshakable resolution , and remarkable steadiness and self-poise . Intellectually he is not a brilliant man , and as a naval strategist he is said to be surpassed by Admiral Shimamura , his chief of staff ; but in soundness of judgment and firmness of purpose he takes first rank , and as commander-in-chief of a fleet in action he is probably the most capable and trustworthy man that Japan has pro duced.
