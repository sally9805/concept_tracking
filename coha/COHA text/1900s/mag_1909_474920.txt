THE new science of radioactivity has had a stimulating effect upon subjects of natural knowledge far removed from physics and chemistry . It has set men thinking that possibly , in branches of knowledge wholly different , long-established doctrines and concepts might not have the impregnability that appeared ? that , in fact , it was time for the keepers of the house of natural knowledge to have a general house-cleaning . Radioactivity has to do , primarily , with matter , but as the concomitant term for matter in the mind of nearly everybody is " life , " revelations in the one have inspired reinvestigation in the other , and now in every tongue voices are again calling the questions : What is Life ? Whence came it ? and , Whither does it go ? But in all this scientific imbroglio there has appeared no basis of agreement whatever . This inability of thinking men to arrive at , at least , some kind of a concordat appears in the very definitions of the life that they discuss . Life is self-movement ; life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist death ; life is the principle of individuation or the power that unites a given all into a whole ; life is the continuous adjustment of internal to external relations . When one examines closely into these most diverse definitions , one sees that their only agreement lies in an unconscious or subconscious evasion . The minds that formulated these definitions defined the properties and powers of a thing , a something which they were unwilling or too tender to postulate . These properties and powers defined above must inhere in something , must they not ? ? must be possessed by something ? and this something behind the definitions describing its powers is what men mean by " Life . " But if " Life " is an existent entity ruling over the gross matter which it inhabits there ought to be some evidence for it , something other than " the evidence of things unseen , " and hence any paper dealing with the relation of " Life " to the body ought to proceed first to answer the question , not what is " Life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quest has been deemed wholly within the province of the biologist , and through it he has found a beautiful , wonderful mechanism ? and nothing more . It seems to be accepted by the great body of present-day biologists that there is in the living body no evidence of an inner god , and this doctrine , under the name of mechanism , now blares its challenge through all the uncouth terminologies of modern science . But a mechanism appears to imply a mechanic , and so a few believe that though they can not see him , there abides secretly in the living being a maker and worker of the machine ? a master mechanic ? called " Life . " Now chemistry looks deeper than biology , and it may be , then , that through chemistry , and within the mazy configuration of the body 's very atoms , we may behold the face of the workman . The first obvious thing about any " living " being is the substance of it ? the pounds of material of which it is composed . Is there anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is esoteric ; anything that might show the action or the presence of this " Life " ? There is this about the substances that constitute a " living " being : there is the bewildering complexity of them , and their lability or irritability . These two characteristics of " living " matter are so salient as to appear at first sight transcendental . But this is not so ; the complexity of these substances is due chiefly to the carbon atoms that in such large measure comprise them . There is nothing transcendental about this power of the carbon atom ; it is a long-known , perfectly recognized fact of general chemistry ? " vitality " has nothing to do with it . As for the lability of " living " matter , it is due in the main to the nitrogen atom , the most powerful , mutable entity in nature . Thera is nothing occult about it ; in fact , the restless character of the nitrogen atom is much more pronounced in guncotton , nitroglycerine , and in gunpowder than it is in the proteids of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most salient characteristics of " living " matter nothing that is mysterious , ultra-knowledgeable , or extra-scientific . As for the intrinsic nature of these substances , there is this to be said : that when the chemist can make in his laboratory bodies identical in composition and in property with substances of vegetable or animal origin , there is no longer any mystery in these substances per se ? i. e. , except in so far as everything is mystery . He has been able to do this , and every year brings its increasing swarm of synthesized natural products . To take a few examples : he has recently made in his laboratory the indigo of the indigo plant ; vanillin of the vanilla pod ; chrysin of poplar buds ; apigenin of parsley ; luteolin of the broom plant ; fieetin of yellow cedar ; quercetin of sumac ; kiimpferol of the blue larkspur ; galangin of the galanga root ; camphor of the camphor tree , and even nicotine of tobacco . Others have been made in the laboratory that are the products of the animal organism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leucine , indoleacetic acid , and even turacin , the red pigment of the feathers of the plantain-eating birds . Searching through the nooks and crannies of living things , and , of course , taking the easier ones first , the chemist is gradually building up by the artificial means of his laboratory ' the natural substances of the animal and the plant . For the synthesis of many substances the difficulties for the nonce are too great . He does what he can . Thus , if he can not synthesize the substance , he may determine its constitution , and if he can not determine its constitution he may at least isolate it . Thus , with the proteids , those indefinitely complex and mobile constituents of living tissue ; these substances are not the beautiful , precipi table , separable , crystalline substances of the inorganic world , but are , on the contrary , " messy " gelatinous mixtures called " colloids . " Out of the muck of this enveloping and interpenetrating mixture he drags his quarry , some one chemical substance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the reasons of his past successes for believing that he will ultimately analyze it and synthesize it . With the proteids success proceeds apace . Emil Fischer of Berlin , his students , and his emulating colleagues the world over , have succeeded not only in isolating proteid bodies , but in splitting them down into determinable " cleavage products , " and have , as a matter of fact , actually succeeded in synthesizing one or two of the simpler type . Just so surely as the years pass , so surely will chemistry devour the mystery of living matter . For , what is the teaching of these thousands of laboratory syntheses ? Just this : that there is no substance in plant or animal that does not lie prone under the domination of chemical science ; that there is visible in these substances per se no entity , no principle , no power called " Life . " There is a certain objection that will be , has been , urged against this conclusion of science . According to the objector : " You have pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reconstruct in your laboratory , and I am willing to admit that you may accomplish this to an indefinite extent , but are your laboratory methods those of Nature ? And if not , may not Nature 's methods be due to a presiding entity ? " This objection has ' force ; it is true : the laboratory methods of organic synthesis have little relation , have barely an analogy with the processes that go on in the living organism . The chemist uses violent reagents , and he uses fire ; the plant , on the contrary , proceeds to the elaboration of its complex compounds in the smoothest , mildest way , and within a degree or two of temperature . The action of the plant seems transcendental . But not at all ; if the chemist can not imitate the plant process , he has clues , several of them , to the mystery . One of these clues is catalysis , the discovery of which is transforming the face of chemical science . There exist in the bodies of plants and animals substances that bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being there ; substances that dictate what reactions shall , or shall not , take place therein ; these substances are , for the most part , called enzymes . Thus , there is diastase from barley malt , which , like the ptyalin of the saliva , has the power of transforming starch into sugar ; there is pepsin in the gastric juice which decomposes insoluble albuminous food products into a soluble form ; there is invertase from " yeast , " which has the power to transform 200,000 times its weight of sugar into invert sugar , quite a different substance ; there is rennet , which will transform 400,000 times its weight of soluble casein . Such sub-stances , the most of thorn , remain quite unaffected by their valuable exertions . All the kinks and corners of the bodies of plants and animals have these efficient little chemical substances , which , at the right time and the right place , exert their powerful " personality " upon the juices of the organisms to their consequent reaction . Very remarkable are some contemporary discoveries of this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lining of the small intestine , passes into the blood , and when , in the course of its circulation , it comes into the pancreas , it causes by its mere presence the secretion of the pancreatic fluid , which itself contains an enzyme ; secretin is the enzyme of an enzyme . There are other substances elaborated in the body of the prospective mother , which , introducing themselves into the blood , determine , again by their mere presence , the changes necessary for the proper emplacement of the unborn child . There are still others which , formed in the tissues of this child , will , when they pass into the blood of the mother , evoke in the mother 's breast , at the proper time , the nourishment for the child when born Organic substances such as these enzymes that do not , apparently , enter into a reaction , but , instead , cause it , are known as catalysts , and the process as catalysis . The presence of these influential substances in Were it not for the limitations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " vitality " through certain activities of " living " matter has led us to chemical catalysis , so should we be led through others to photo-chemistry , and through still others , such as excitability , reproduction , and nervous action , to general physical chemistry . Wherever we look at a point in all the vast expanse of special properties connected with " living " matter that point resolves itself into a chemical mechanism , and into nothing else . One of the phenomena of " living " matter , peculiarly " vital " in the hyper-mechanical explanations afforded for it , is " response , " the power of an animal or a plant to respond to a stimulus . The muscles move in response to a nerve , the retina responds to light , the sensitive-plant to a touch , and so on . This power to respond , or irritability , is one of the signal manifestations of " Life . " It has been discovered that one of the best methods of measuring this response is electrical in its nature , and through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as animals and plants respond to a stimulus , so do metals and other inorganic substances . Furthermore . just as animals and plants become fatigued , and refuse to respond under a stimulation that is continuous , so do metals . Living beings and metals are alike , too , in their action under stimulants , substances that have the faculty of exalting this power of response ; they are alike in temporarily losing this power under the action of anaesthetics ; they are alike in the diminution of the intensity of this power under the action of depressants like potassium bromide ; they are alike in losing it permanently under the action of poisons ; and in a multitude of other similitudes , it has been shown that this whole business of the power of an animal or a plant to respond to stimuli is a function , not of " Life , " but of matter , and with the out-and-out proof of this has passed away the necessity of postulating for it any unknowable and arbitrary " vital " force . But outside the substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereare the forms of them -- so different from the substances of the mineral world that they seem of a wholly different order . Persistent investigation , however , tells a different story . The difference between the organic and the inorganic worlds is by no means so accentuated as appears . Thus , from crystallography , we hear of " sterile " liquids containing substances in solution that require the presence of a crystalline " germ " to bring about the " birth " of crystals ? curiously biological language for crystallography to indulge itself in unnecessarily . We hear of veritable artificial tissues that simulate in a marvellous way the cellular tissues of the living plant , even to their division and segmentation . We hear of multitudes of mineral forms , artificially constituted , that betray the most manifold likeness to the beautiful forms of the smaller organisms ? artificial amoebae , diatoms , radiolaria , and many others , made out of mineral silicates . The studies of the relations of mineral forms to the forms of living organisms constitute a new science ? plasmology . This science is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no uncertain tone , that the form and structure of " living " things are due solely to the interplay of physical and chemical forces , and that they are in no fashion the expression of an inner " Life " ; that even man , in form and action so divine , is , speaking physically , just as much so , and no more than the veriest water-worn rock of ocean . Then , again , there is the energy of the " living " body . If there is in the body any presiding entity it must be , from the very definitions of this " Life , " a working entity , and hence there is entire propriety in expecting evidence of its existence in some difference between the income and the outgo of bodily energy . It may be that " Life " would add to the bodily energy , it may be that it would subtract it , but simple reasonableness demands that if it is as " energetic " as defined , it ought to alter it . But refined experimentation denies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most convincing manner that the body derives all its energy from the food consumed , or , if the food is insufficient , ? from its own body-tissue . The outgo of energy is exactly equal to the income , and it may be regarded as established by his experiments with the respiration calorimeter that the law of the conservation of energy holds for the animal body . Hubner is still another hivestigator who has done yeoman service in proving this same fact . There is , therefore , in the employment of energy by the " living " body no hint whatever of the existence of a " Life . " It is positively what it ought to be , were the body solely a mass of matter undergoing chemical change . Finally , there are other functions of a living organism , general functions , such as movement , reproduction , assimilation . May it not be that one or some of these are extra-chemical ? For example , there are the parallel processes of constructive and destructive metabolism , the mysterious weaving and unweaving of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being there arise , unceasingly , complicating molecules of substance ; there are islands of atoms , kingdoms of atoms , and finally , as worlds of atoms , these protoplasmic molecules break into their disintegration products ; all this over and over again , and so we " live " in the stream of energy produced there-through . The inorganic world has many analogies to this ; erode little analogies , but such as are sufficient to show that this upbuilding and upbuilding in a stream of energy are by no means peculiar to the " vital " process . It may be that the light that is shining on this page is emitted by a gas-mantle . This mantle consists of 999 volumes of thoria to 1 volume of ceria . This speck of ceria is absolutely essential to the light emissivity of the mantle . Its powers , apparently , lie in this , that in the burning lamp the ceria is constantly taking up oxygen from the air which it hands over to the gas for burning , producing thereby the incandescence of the enveloping thoria ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incessantly building and breaking throughout the life of the lamp . If this explanation of its powers is true , it gives us the simplest example of this constructive and destructive metabolism . The great mystery about this process has always been the constructive phase vol. cxvni ? No , rr08. - 114of it , the growth of " living " matter through assimilation . I shall take space to examine this assimilation , for it has always been the hCite noire of the mechanists . Since assimilation is a phenomenon of all " living " matter , it simplifies things to examine one of the elemental forms of " life . " There is an acknowledgedly " living " thing ? a bacterium ? which , for convenience , is called A , and it is examined at the time T. At this precise moment it consists of a substances chemically defined . It exists in a liquid medium , beef broth , which contains m substances , also chemically defined . Is there anything more ? Nothing that we know of . Between these as ? rn substances certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant , T , , the bacterium A is changed ; it now consists not of a , but of a , substances . Now , behold a miracle : At the end of a certain time this changed bacterium undergoes a succession of further changes , and finally divides into two bacteria , B ? and B ? each of which at the time T , consists of n substances , the same substances as are contained in A at the time T but doubled in quantity . Nor is this the end of the process , for , remaining in the same medium , these two bacteria B , and B , change just as A did , and , at a given moment , they too divide , so that there result four bacteria ? C ? C , , C2 , and C , ? also at a given instant containing these same a substances as A at the time T but quadrupled in quantity . Finally , as the result of the indefinite successive division and redivision of C ? C ? 02 , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each containing at a given instant the same n substances as arc contained in A at the time T. how curious is all this to the chemist ! That a mass of chemical substance , having a certain composition at a given time , should change and grow , and in that change and growth should suddenly reduplicate itself , and this over and over again , until this multiplication of the initial substance is extreme . Ali well , this is assimilation , the one phenomenon beyond all others that has led man to believe in the existence of a transcendental " Life " governing matter . But re-examine the phenomenon described . This beef broth in which the bacteria are now swarming has changed profoundly from its original condition . There has been a large evolution of carbonic acid , and many new substances have appeared in it that are discoverable through chemical analysis . Evidently these swarms of bacteria are due to chemical interaction with the broth . In fact , this " assimilation " seems to resolve itself into this : That in the original bacterium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium to reproduce themselves up to the chemical destruction of the broth . This is a curious chemistry , and a new chemistry , but I fail to see anything in it but chemistry . Just why these plastic substances react with the medium to reproduce their identical substance nobody knows ; lint neither does anybody know , one whit more , why oxygen and hydrogen react together to produce a substance wholly different ? water . Of course , chemistry knows more with every passing son , but in the mean time it is satisfactory that this mysterious " assimilation , " this multiplication of plastic substance , may be represented in the form of an equation . There is the plastic substance a , and the medium Q , and the products of the reaction R , and , hence , a + Q ? Xa + R , where X is a number greater than 1 . No " Life " figures in this equation ; nothing superchemical ? nothing hyper-mechanical ; nor is there any visible reason why there should . And as with " assimilation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with the mysterious phenomena such as contagion , immunity , the actions of anti-toxins , veinans , etc. ; in no phenomenon of living matter is there to be found the necessity of postulating anything other than chemistry . The search has proved unavailing ; instead of and lifeless matter there has been found justmatter ; we have sought for " Life " and we have found " Law . " It is true that there have been here examined but the sparsest few of the known facts of natural knowledge . This has been done in order to make these few significant , and with the idea of saying in this place advisedly and plainly that all the related facts of contemporary science declare the same story , thatthere is no supernal oral entity visible in the activities of living matter . Further , it . is true that that which we know is as nothing to what remains to be known ; that science knows the secrets of " living " matter would be as preposterous a statement as man could make . There exist in the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintest glimpse , though we are sure that the secrets therein are chemical . Our knowledge is but a pinhole in the veil of our ignorance , but through this pinhole this much may be seen , that the complex mobile mass of matter undergoing chemical reaction that passes as a " living " being proceeds in substance , action , form , and motion as much under the laws of chemistry as any piece of zinc in a test-tube of sulphuric acid . We have seen the master workman at his work , but the face disclosed is Chemistry , not " Life . " We come , then , to the conclusion that every bodily action takes place through the operation of , and in accordance with , natural laws . Tf by Life is meant a transcendental entity that acts in place of these laws , or transects them , there is no evidence of its existence in living matter ; the body is a mechanism through and through . Arid yet , however unreasonable it may appear , and unnecessary and even absurd , this Iaw-ridden living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangled up in it , somehow ? associated with it strange things called perceiv-ings , thinkings , willings , feelings , and consciousness , things that are not matter at all . There are , thus , the two parts of us , the matter part of us and the not matter part of us . What is the relation between them ? In this , of course , is asked the riddle of the world . The answers are not so many , and they are as old as thought . It may safely be said that many , perhaps most . Melt of science ? physiological chemists , biologists , and psychologists ? are agreed upon one . " There is no Life ' apparently necessary to , or visible in , the body : there is no ' Life . ' " Upon this assumption they believe and they teach that all our feelings , thinkings , and willings , our very consciousness , are the products of the play of the physicochemical processes in the brain . They believe that were it possible to understand . completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be possible to account completely for his conduct : that man is an automaton , the most delicate mechanism in the world , composed of differentiated structures exquisitely sensitive to the play of physical and chemical forces , and wholly accounted for by them . They believe that mind is wholly a product of matter ( collateral product , they call it ) , that consciousness simply " holds a candle " to our activities , and that the power of the will is illusory . In other words , there is no entity called " Life . " This belief , which is , of course , very old , is now under a new name , mechanism , blowing about the world from corner to corner . But the men who are militant in preaching this creed are men of science , men whose philosophy is essentially an avocation ; and consequently the question arises as to how acceptable this creed is to modern philosophers , men whose sole business it is to study these high matters . It is safe to say that there is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any prominence who is a mechanist , nor , indeed , any of the highest standing in Europe . This fact seems very significant , and it leads one to ask why men of science are so generally mechanists , and why philosophers are not ? The belief of the man of science , when carefully considered , seems to depend , not on reason , but on motive . The positive function of science is to arrange all phenomena in an orderly causative array ; its ultimate ambition is to find for all the happenings of the universe one single vast equation , in which figures every past and every future event ; the object of science is to destroy chaos . In dealing with matter the man of science finds himself most encouragingly successful in his efforts , and to such an extent that when confronted with mind he obtains an intense desire , in order to facilitate this great business of setting his house in order , to tag it on to matter as a product. , thus bringing mind into the causal array of an exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science . " But this materialism is really illegitimate . The philosophers have shown that it takes its rise in a pure assumption , that it is self-contradictory , that it is unimaginable , that it does not explain , and that it is the result of a prejudice for an orderly universe at the expense of a significant one . The great fundamental assumption of the mechanist lies apparently in placing in a logical sequence the two statements : There is no " Life " visible ? There is no " Life " ; the hyphen between them is actually a chasm of illogicality . That the body is a mechanism in which every muscle and gland and nerve functions through chemical law , and through nothing else , is a conviction that grows with every passing day ; furthermore , if by " Life " is meant a spiritual entity that is interfering with these chemical processes , its existence may with reasonable safety be denied . But if by " Life " is meant a spiritual entity that abides within the body , and to a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetics , we can not possibly deny its existence ; our only means of detecting such an entity is through interference . That there may be in the body a resident entity that guides without interfering is not by any means contra-scientific . For example , it may be that the relation between the chemical nerve processes and the psychic processes is one of induction , crudely analogous , let us say , to electro-magnetic induction , and it is possible even to-day to draw a parallel between the two processes to a very persuasive degree . With the ever growing establishment of the fact that biology is nothing but a branch of chemistry it is not forbidden us to imagine that ultimately in the far future it may be possible through a new science , chemical-psychology , to correlate the chemical processes of nervous action with the psychic processes of a spiritual being enveloping them in such a way that it will appear . demonstrably , that " we , also , are His children .
