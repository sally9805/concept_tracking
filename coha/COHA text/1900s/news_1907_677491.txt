When you call Mr. Choate to account to-day for designating before the Rapid Transit Commission the corner of Twenty-third Street and Broadway as the " Dead Man 's Curve , " while you adhere to the ancient distinction of the Fourteenth Street corner for that name , you are mistaken : it deserves it no longer .

This is the real " Dead Man 's Curve " of to-day .
