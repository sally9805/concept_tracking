 | NUMBER ? " The Voice is of pleasant quality ; daily one hears it and often . But on the Voice 's part the conversation is restricted to a few set words . The Voice seems strangely impersonal ; little more than the sound from an automaton , wound up always to say the same things over and over again . But the irritating effect of the " line-is-busy " phonographic attachment , now pretty generally discarded , indicates that the average telephone-user appreciates , subconsciously at least , that , after all , the Voice is something more than impersonal ; that its owner acts as a friendly guide to our conversational ends . In the earlier days of the service there was more latitude for the exercise of amicable offices on the part of the telephone operator . But now the friendly manifestations are those very appreciable ones that come from a highly organized system , rigidly disciplined , yet flexibly disposed to meet the best requirements of its patrons . In those days , however , conversation between telephone operators and telephone users was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , in busy hours ; lengthier chats when traffic was quiet . For instance , the writer remembers how , in that period , he had occasion to call up a friend at his business office one day early in the year . " He 's a fine man ! " remarked the girl at the switchboard . " He is ? How do you know ? " " He sent me a V for Christmas . " Our friend doubtless received good returns for his generosity in the way of  | exceptionally prompt service . But , nowadays he could gain nothing from such an outlay , even were it possible to identify his operator . Another memory of those times is that of the day after a closely contested election in the early eighties . The writer , who had voted on the winning side , called up a suburban friend who had been an intense champion of the defeated candidate , and gave a close imitation of a crowing rooste whereupon a merry peal of laughter from the telephone girl mingled with some emphatic remarks from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise be impossible now . There are traditions about susceptible subscribers , charmed by pleasing voices , falling in love with telephone girls ; of courtships conducted by telephone , the parties not meeting till after the engagement . Mark Twain 's Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur 's Court " had a sweetheart whom he called " Hello Central ! " He fell in love with her in some such way , and pined for her out of the legendary past , back into which he had so strangely slidden . But all tales of telephonic courtships , so far as the girls at the switchboard are involved , belong to a past that is rapidly growing remote . We of the great public who may be disposed to be petulant with the telephone girl ? too often scolding her as well are little aware that the troubles complained of can not , as a rule , be in the least degree of her making or in any way connected with her , but due to circumstances of outside origin . Hence telephonic amenities are too apt to be of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most remarkable aspect of the case is that such offenses , as a rule , are very much greater at the top of the social ladder than at the lower rungs ; that in the swellest residential district of a great city the ordinary courtesies of life are much less observed in telephonic intercourse than in the humbler sections . In the former there is apt to be not only much imperious conduct but no little rudeness and even abusiveness , together with a generally inconsiderate and unreasonable attitude that would hardly he looked for among intelligent , not to say well-mannered , people . While such things are far from the rule , they are altogether so frequent as to justify some question as to the politeness of polite society . The absence of face-to-face relations is responsible for such scant courtesy . As we have seen , the Voice at the switchboard seems to most of us more of an abstraction than a presence ? merely a factor in the complex mechanism of vocal exchange . Hence , telephone users are tempted to allow themselves liberties of speech towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought face to face with the same person . A somewhat extreme instance of this sort of thing , though perhaps not untypical , is the case of a prominent business man in a certain great city , who , in his daily use of the long-distance service , resorted to such violent profanity in addressing the operators that he had to be expostulated with from headquarters . " Now suppose one of your customers should come in and use such language to your stenographer ? " he was asked . " He would be kicked out of the door before he could put in another yip ! " was the frank response . The man was quick to see the parallel . But the habit was too strong upon him . At present only an insignificant fraction of telephone users have more than the vaguest idea of the operations that make possible their daily exchanges of speech . They picture , perhaps , a room where some girls are receiving their calls and crying them out in shrill tones to other girls somewhere across the room ? the latter somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , filling the place like the maze of clothes-lines in a tenement back yard . That is apt to be the limit to which the imagination goes , if exercised at all . Let us look for a while at the actual workings of a great telephone exchange . Telephone managements say they welcome the public to such inspections . There is a very good reason why they should . Every telephone patron has had some annoying or exasperating experience in connection with the service . Almost invariably the blame is laid to  | the service itself rather than upon circumstances beyond its control . Hence all sorts of hard feelings are cherished . In the light of his new understanding the open-minded visitor is likely to declare that whatever complaints he may have to make in the future will be made with reservations and in a more charitable frame of mind . One finds such a great exchange quite other than the gossip-shop that the mind may have pictured . The first thing noted is the absence of chatter , of confusion . This seems astonishing . The volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapped and let out all at once , would make a veritable Niagara of words ? surpassing the clamor of a stock exchange , even that of an afternoon tea ! But here the first impression is one of orderliness , of quietness , almost of silence , for the atmosphere is that of subdued and repressed utterance . As we come into the center of the room we see on all sides of it , seated back towards us , scores of girls , all facing their tasks at the switchboard . Behind these , at intervals , other girls are standing or passing to and fro . The operations are so deft , systematic , and well ordered as to justify a military comparison . Outside of the great factories , it is doubtful if any other aggregation of girls in our modern industrial life is so indicative of organization , of discipline , of collective activity.in a great public service . One quickly perceives how thoroughly the telephone operator has been misrepresented by the cheap wit of the " pert paragrapher " in his talk about the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giddy , inattentive , and gumchewing creature , over-curious as to the affairs of the community at large , depicted in the funny columns . The girls are all seriously busy at their posts , but there is no effect of bustle whatever , their activities are so well adjusted . Looking along the ranks of youthful femininity , one notes the dominance of distinctively American types , notwithstanding the modifying tokens of various peculiarly racial characters imparted by the divers foreign elements that are blending themselves in the populations of our great cities . A correct-featured quality is the rule among these scores of maiden profiles . As an attribute of the gentler sex the word " pretty " has been somewhat overworked ; at times our public conveyances suggest some doubt as to its justification . But no doubt occurs here ! The charm of youthful good looks is heightened by the air of intelligence necessary to the task . Altogether the telephone girl represents almost precisely the same social grades as the stenographers and typewriters ? the wholesome American middle class . In attractiveness for young women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to that of typewriter and stenographer . The pay is better , on the whole ; the working hours are shorter and more regular ; there are more openings for promotion ; there is less nervous strain . The telephone girl , to be sure , is subject to no little vexation from the capricious tempers of her public . But the burden of such relations is borne by the " desk " operators , who have considerable responsibility in their relations with the community at large . The work of the ordinary operator is one of routine , devoted to the expeditious discharge of functions that , on the whole , vary little from time to time . Let us watch the work for a few minutes . With their tasteful dress , quietly appropriate to their occupation , bearing the dainty touches of individual adornment , these girls are altogether charming to look upon . They sit comfortably in high chairs designed with special reference to ease of position . Held in place on the head and covering the ear is the receiver ; before the mouth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoke-like contrivance , regalia-like in effect . With a nice deference to the natural feminine regard for presentable appearance at all times , these instruments are inconspicuous in design and not in the least disfiguring . They are likewise extraordinarily light , contrived with a wise consideration for the fact that weight means fatigue and impairs good service . At the back of every nine operators a supervisor paces to and fro ? a young woman who has been promoted from the  | ranks for exceptional efficiency . This divides the working force into companies of ten ? the supervisor , a sort of sergeant in this army of gentle Amazons , ever vigilant to see that the work is going well , lending a hand whenever any situation out of the ordinary develops . Each girl keeps a close watch upon her section of the switchboard , quick to see the opalescent dots of electric light that respectively appear and disappear at various points , according to the demands of the moment ; in response inserting and removing little metallic plugs with their attached cords , as connections are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls seem like weavers at some gigantic loom , the numerous cords crossing and recrossing as if in the execution of some wondrous fabric . Indeed , a wondrous fabric of speech is here woven into the record of each day . Were it but phonographically recorded , and shown with all its intricate interrelations of conversation , it might make much marvel in the world . The switchboard is a wonderful affair , a phenomenon of costliness . When one learns the expensive character of this huge instrument , it seems almost remarkable that telephone service can be as cheaply performed as it is . In the quarter-century of practical telephony switchboard types have several times been successively adopted and discarded at enormous outlays . Apparatus costing millions of dollars has been ruthlessly consigned ! to the scrap-heap upon the invention of something better . In the present type perfection appears to have been reached . Yet it is not impossible that some great innovation may yet send this equipment the way of its predecessors . The switchboard in one of the central exchanges of a great city represents an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of a goodly public building . All this exceedingly complicated mechanism must be kept in absolutely perfect order , free at all times from the suspicion of a fault . In the great exchange at Chicago , for instance , there was much trouble from the foulness of the soot-laden atmosphere of the city . The metal-work would get so grimy and dirty that insulation was seriously affected and satisfactory service was impossible . So the windows were hermetically sealed , and , at a great cost , an elaborate system was installed whereby the  | air , washed and filtered , absolutely free from all smoke and dust , was pumped into all the rooms under ideal conditions of purity , humidity , and temperature . This not only remedied the electrical and mechanical troubles ; the health of the employees was correspondingly improved , with a marked . diminution of coughs , colds , and bronchial affections . In the Bell companies of the United States the switchboards alone have cost at least $20,000,000 . Nearly half that figure has been invested in the central stations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlay of almost nine million dollars . In these there are seven million sockets and sixty-five thousand miles of speech - transmitting wire , not to mention the more than two hundred thousand miles of fine wire wound around the numerous magnets and relays . The switchboard before us directly serves 13,176 subscribers ' stations . The huge mechanism forms a sort of high dado , not only around one room , but several . This exchange , it should be noted , occupies adjacent floors in two great neighboring office buildings . On other floors are the switchboards for the toll lines and long-distance systems that connect with the other districts of the company and with all the allied companies of the parent corporation throughout the country . This single switchboard has the glimmerings of 6,354 little lamps that incessantly flash up and go out , somewhat after the manner of the intermittent lighthouse signals strung along the coast . To describe in detail the various operations necessary to bring two persons into speaking relations would be hardly worth while here . To be really understood the process would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well be attempted . Every subscriber 's telephone in the exchange has its circuit that connects it with every section of the switchboard . In the first place , it is represented by a switch-socket and a linelamp , with its corresponding number , in the lower part of a given section . In the second place , itis again represented by another switchsocket , with its number repeated , in the upper part of each and every section . It is thus repeated dozens of times . Before each operator is a battery of flexible cords arranged in pairs and terminating in little metallic plugs , When not in use these cords are kept down by the weights that are attached below . A line-lamp suddenly glows . The operator touches a switch that connects her own personal telephone with a certain pair of cords . She inserts one of the plugs into the socket by the lamp , and the connection with the subscriber is made . The turning of a small key enables her to speak to him and hear his reply . " Number ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inserts the other plug of the cord-pair into the upper switch-socket that bears the number called for . A turn of the " ringing key " sets the telephone bell to jingling . The connection is thus made , and if the subscriber whose number is called  | page deleted  | numbers asked for are called . Since these repeat every number in every section of the switchboard , they are termed " multiple jacks . " Then we have " a operators " and " b operators . " The " a operators " receive and transmit the calls from the subscribers direct . The " b operators " need more experience and skill for their work . They receive and transmit the trunk-line calls between other exchanges and systems and the great switchboard . The " b operator 's " position is the first step in the line of promotion . As the supervisors are the sergeants of this little army , so the " b operators " may be called the corporals . The great exchanges usually have commodious lunch-rooms attached . With many companies it is customary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulated vessels and served free to the employees ; some even run restaurants , where a liberal range of wholesome food is supplied at cost . Every such exchange has its " rest-room , " for use during the leisure moments of the day . Here is an air of comfort and refinement -- lounges , easy chairs , magazines , good pictures on the walls , a sympathetic matron in charge . Some exchanges have co-operative societies and associations for mutual benefit and social enjoyment . For instance , every girl in a certain exchange agrees to pay an assessment of five cents a week into a fund for adorning the rest-room with statuettes and pictures . Such an association in one of the Boston exchanges gave a delightful concert of high-class music in the finest public hall in the city , all the talent coming from its own membership . In one of the Chicago exchanges the girls instituted a rest-room scrap-book . " The idea spread to other exchanges , and the results were so interesting that the company offered two prizes for the best collections . The highest prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to books for a library in the rest-room . The company contributed the bookcase , and a committee of the girls selected the books . The choice did credit to their literary taste . This led to a regular library system , the company duplicating the girls ' subscriptions . Three of the Chicago exchanges are supplied from the Public Library , the latter collecting and delivering the books . The large exchanges customarily have an emergency-room for the proper treatment of any cases of illness that may suddenly develop . Another aspect of welfare work is the employment of some competent young woman to discuss with the girls their social and intellectual needs , and make recommendations for improvement . This has led to systematic courses of reading and study ; also to classes for sewing and for physical culture . In various suburban exchanges where there is ground-room about the building , the girls are encouraged to establish and cultivate flower gardens , the products of which charmingly adorn the rest-rooms . The tendency is towards a steady increase of these efforts to make the telephone girl 's lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsiderate subscribers occasionally may cause her . Among the attractive new propositions for her benefit is one for roof gardens in connection with the great office buildings where large exchanges are often located . These would be outdoor summer rest-rooms , with refreshing breezes and wide prospects at command . The average period of service for operators is about three years . The reasons for resignation are numerous ? matrimony a leading one , as in all forms of feminine employment . It would augur well for the improvement of mankind if wives and mothers were generally of so high a grade , physically and mentally , as these telephone girls are . The telephone operators ' ranks are kept up by a constant stream of new recruits . The demand is greater than the supply . With the steady increase of this army the standard of intelligence and capacity tends to rise . To meet this demand schools for telephone operators are now maintained by the companies in several of the great cities . Here the girls serve a brief cadetship ; instead of paying for tuition they are paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point the youth are ? a novelty in civil education .
