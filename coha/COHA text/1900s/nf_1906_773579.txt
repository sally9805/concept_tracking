txt 5o THE AMATEUR ARTIST a silk handkerchief , or a piece of chamois leather . The leather , when soiled by the color , may be repeatedly washed . The surface requiring to be acted upon is thus treated : ? charging the brush with pure water , carefully wet that part of the under-tint or color where the light is required ; then apply to the spot a piece of blotting-paper , by which the superfluous moisture will be absorbed ; by the omission of this , you would fail in producing the desired effect . The moisture being thus removed , immediately apply the art gum , rubbing cautiously at first , until you ascertain whether the friction has been sufficient ; if it has not , proceed more freely , until the intended effect has been produced . If the object be not gained in this manner , repeat the entire process , until it is properly effected . Should the handkerchief be used , the blotting-paper may be dispensed with ; for the surface having been moistened to the required extent , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing , upon the moistened portion , the finger covered with the handkerchief or with the leather . The lights also may be subsequently tinted , if necessary ; or , should they be found to be injurious to the effect , the former tone may be recovered by placing upon them a tint of the removed color . The lights procured by these means are small points , which can not , in the first instance , be left as all the broad lights of the composition should be . Previous to any of these attempts at putting lights into a drawing , the paper must be perfectly dry ; otherwise the operation may do serious injury to the surrounding parts . ON THE HANDLING OF THE BRUSH . Much of the freedom necessary to spirited and effective execution , particularly in the working of details , will depend on the care and attention bestowed on the manner of using the brush . The hand may be lightly rested , but it must be in such a manner as to secure the perfectly free action of the wrist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In laying on the tints be careful to begin by laying them boldly and at once close to the outline , and not by repeated touches or by dragging the pencil timidly backward and forward . // It is especially to be observed , that , as a general rule , the brush should be tolerably full of color , in order that it may float freely , for upon this the cleanness of the work much depends . The tints should be made moderately liquid before the brush be charged ; and they should be laid upon the paper in a state as fluid as the requisite depth of tint and the preservation of the forms will allow , in order that the interstices of the paper may be well filled , and solidity of effect thus obtained . In working details , the brush , after it is filled with color , should he drawn over a piece of paper provided for this purpose , to bring the hairs , if necessary , to a point , that the markings may be made with neatness and precision ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent a blotty appearance , which sometimes is caused by the over-charging of the brush with color . In such cases the brush , being only moderately filled , should not , after covering the space intended , have too much left in it ; the effect of this will be , that it may be taken off the paper without leaving a floating spot or drop of color at the point of removal . If , however , there should by any mismanagement be left such a floating drop of surplus color , it may be removed by absorbing it into the somewhat dry hair of the pencil . ON THE METHOD OF WORKING A LANDSCAPE . ON LANDSCAPE OUTLINE . The paper having been properly strained upon a drawing-board and being quite dry , the outline of the proposed drawing should be carefully made . This is a preliminary so important and indispensable that we will dwell somewhat minutely upon it . An accurate outline saves an infinity of trouble by securing the hand against errors in the progress of the work ; it ensures confidence in the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the confidence thus communicated is , that the tints are left clean and bright . The outline should be sketched at first lightly , but carefully . The lines may afterwards be strengthened , where necessary , by a more decisive and vigorous touch , but if , in the first efforts to copy an object , the proportions be not correct , it is better to rub out the whole // than to tint upon a multiplicity of lines , which only indicate weakness and cause confusion . Draw , then , with a fine but faithful and firm line , the remote distance , making the lines stronger in touch as they approach the foreground . The foreground itself should be laid in with something of spirit and decision ; and you thus define , even at the outset of your work , the different degrees of distance intended . No shading , however , with the lead pencil must be attempted in any stage of drawing the outline . If mountains constitute the utmost distance , the lines upon their edges should be extremely faint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless outline may involve you in difficulties which may ultimately cause you to abandon your work in disgust . After the mountains have received their first tints of color , so as to define their forms , be careful to efface the pencil outline with india rubber , or with art gum , the color being perfectly dry . The result of this will be a charming aerial effect , and the removal of any hardness on the edge of the wash . In tracing distant objects , delineate their general forms only , without . attempting detail ; as , for example , in sketching a mountain , it will be sufficient to give the extreme outline . In the outline of the foreground , however , greater minuteness must be observed ; and the objects which usually constitute this portion of the picture ? such as plants , figures , weeds , the bark of trees , and the like ? should be carefully drawn from correct studies made from Nature . In drawing the outlines of trees , their stems and branches , as far as they are visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a slight indication of form ; it should be described rather by a series of short lines or dots than by anything approaching to careful manipulation . The extremities require a free touch : for , in fact , were every spray of foliage to be drawn in outline , the brush could not follow the pencil , without the sacrifice of all freedom and effective breadth of execution . In that portion where buildings of any kind are introduced , the greatest accuracy is indispensable in drawing the form of the winLANDSCAPE // dows , doors , chimneys , and other such details , as well as any other ornamental parts . To efface the pencil lines , when any alteration may be necessary , the bit of art gum will be found to be a better material than india-rubber , as it is less likely than the latter would be to smear or injure the surface of the paper . We have particularly recommended a neat and light outline for many reasons , and especially for this : that , if any force or depth of pencilling were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vitiate the color . THE COLORING OF A LANDSCAPE . Sky. ? It has been generally recommended to the student to complete this portion of his work first ; and in some cases , where strongly marked trees or buildings occur , and appear in direct opposition to the sky , it may be advisable to lay the intended amount of color in the sky before attempting to work up the remainder of the landscape : yet this is frequently not the best method of proceeding . The tones of the sky , if carried over distant mountains , assist greatly in blending and harmonising them with it . It is even best , sometimes , to proceed so far as to get a certain amount of broad light and shade into the picture ( according to the character of the composition ) , in order afterwards to arrange the clouds in a manner most suitable to the effect ; or at least so as that they may not appear out of character with it . The drawing-board should be inclined at a sufficient angle to allow the tint to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush ; and previously to commencing the sky , a wash of clear water may be passed , with the flat brush , completely over the paper . The moisture having nearly evaporated , the sky is commenced as follows : In order to produce an evening effect , a light tint of Lake is to he carried to the distance of about one-fourth from the top of the picture , and there a small portion of Indian Yellow is to be gradually added to the wash . This wash must not be abruptly terminated , but carried to the bottom of the paper . The result should be a tint graduating downwards from a pale pink into orange ; becoming warmer towards the horizon , and gradually vanishing into the foreground . // When the surface is quite dry , after this operation , turn the drawing upside down , and repeat the wash of clean water , passing the flat brush very lightly across the surface , so that it may not disturb the tints . Next , prepare a pale wash of pure Cobalt in a saucer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too wet , and of course inverted , wash in the blue from near the line to which you first carried the lake ; increasing the strength of the tint as you approach the upper part of the sky . If this be properly done , the sky will , when dry , show a gradation of light blue and purple , in addition to the tint applied in the first instance . Suppose that the object is a piece of moor scenery , having the distance closed with remote grey hills = a simple and useful subject to begin with . Having replaced the work in its first position , tint the distance with Cobalt and Madder Brown ; these , upon the somewhat orange sky tint carried over the distance , will give a beautiful pearlygrey hue . More of the Madder Brown may be added , as you approach the middle distance , and the tint may then run into Vandyke Brown , or Brown Pink , carried over the foreground . There may occur a pool of water reflecting the sky : ? a passage which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions have been carefully observed , the drawing ought now to present , in color and effect , a tolerable idea of what the finished work will be . It will now be found that the strength of the ground tints has reduced the tone of the sky , which , when first washed in , appeared perhaps of a strength nearly sufficient ; hence , to a certain extent , a repetition of the process is necessary . For this purpose the student must proceed as before . It will not , however , be required to strengthen or force the blue of the upper sky ( a common error with beginners ) ; but simply to strengthen the warmer tints below . Light Red may , in these subsequent washes , be substituted for Lake , and Yellow Ochre for Indian Yellow ; for these colors , being less brilliant than the former , will assist in giving a quieter tone , should it be required . It may be here remarked that it is a good practice to begin genLANDSCAPE // erally with the purer and richer colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued by others , while it is by no means so easy to give due brightness to a dull one . A few somewhat horizontal clouds at the lower portion of the sky , near the hills , may now be touched in , and their shadows made out by pale Cobalt and Lake . The distant hills should be strengthened with a tint of French Blue and Lake ; to which , as you approach The middle distance , add a mixture of Indigo and Brown Pink , which will form a greenish grey , and which may be washed into the Vandyke Brown first carried over the foreground . Let the foreground be much paler in tone than the middle distance , and if any lines occur in the latter , keep them as nearly horizontal as possible ; for this will communicate to that part of the composition the necessary appearance of retiring . The sky being supposed complete , the distribution of light and shade in the picture is the next object of attention . In a scene of the kind supposed , the principal shade will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be said to be the principal light of the subject . But in order to counteract the heaviness inseparable from a large mass of shade , it is necessary that some object or objects , much darker in tone than the general shade of the middle distance , should be introduced ; and in the effective placing of these darker objects lies the skill of the artist . A small hut , and some turf or peat stacks on the distant moor , form valuable materials for introducing these dark masses ; whilst some light smoke curling from the cottage will assist in giving life and spirit to the whole . Irregular patches of furze may be put in , in the middle distance , with the same color as that used for these dark parts ; that is , with a tint either of Sepia and Cobalt , or a mixture of Vandyke Brown and Indigo , Olive Green or Brown Pink being added as the foreground is approached . Sepia and Indian Yellow , Brown Pink , or Vandyke Brown with Lake , will be found admirable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too violent , they may all be reduced by the use of a little Indigo or Cobalt . A few rushes and large weeds , with their reflection in the near water , will aid the effect ; but they should not be too much elaborated , nor made so dark as to interfere with the principal shade . i // Lights procured in the manner already described will give a finish to the picture . On this principle the light smoke may be made out ; as also , leading into the middle distance , a straggling path , on which a small figure on horseback , or a man driving cattle , will afford an opportunity for a bit of bright color ; and this , if well placed , will materially improve the drawing , by lowering the surrounding tones . The great end to be aimed at is the preservation of the tints in the first purity , and the avoidance of the necessity of corrections . The student should therefore , in his early works , neither attempt sponging out , nor aim at too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first all he may desire , nor allow himself to be disheartened because he may see a manifest difference between that which he has clone and that which he hoped to do . ' He should determine to persevere ; for he may rest assured , that with every succeeding attempt a greater degree of success will continually reward his efforts . ON TREES AND FOREGROUNDS . It may be said that no two persons ever painted a tree with precisely the same feeling . Some artists employ the color as wet as possible , and merely blot the forms of the trees in , mingling light and shadow together , and trusting to the lights intended to be taken out by the handkerchief when the work is dry . Others work in a manner altogether different . They employ their color in a state almost dry ; and the hairs of the brush , spread abroad like a fan , are made use of rather to scumble the forms in than to define them properly . A medium between these extremes is best to be pursued . The brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stems and such other details having been carefully drawn in according to the foregoing instructions , the tree may be commenced from the upper part . Let us suppose , for illustration , that it is desired to represent an ashtree . Prepare a quiet green with Gamboge and Indigo and a portion of Burnt Sienna , and with this fill a small saucer . Prepare in like manner a cool grey , composed of Cobalt and Light Red , having a brush for each tint so prepared . The sky being supposed to be finished upwards , the student , having his brush moderately filled with the green tint , must endeavor with a free touch to give the effect of a light tracery of leaves , beginning at // the top of the tree ; the extremities of the masses ? or , in other words , the general outline ? it will be remembered , must define the character of the tree . Care must be taken to avoid filling up the masses , but numerous small interstices should be left to show the lights piercing them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing the grey tint , may now be exchanged quickly for the other . It is supposed that the student has carried the green tint as far down as the lower edge of the highest mass of the part of the foliage which is in light . The color being still wet , let him apply the grey tint in continuation of the first , until the form of the shadow or inner part of the tree at that place is marked . He must now resume the green tint ; and so on alternately to the lower part of the tree , finishing with greys to express the dark shade under the lowest foliage . This method of running or blending the two tints of the green and the grey together often affords accidental circumstances , which , when skilfully and tastefully turned to account , are highly suggestive of good effects . It should be mentioned , that when the green is intended to represent leaves in sunlight , it should incline rather to a yellow hue , so as to give the effect of light and warmth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case be added with advantage . The trunks should be put in with Grey qualified by a little Vandyke Brown . The stems and branches also may be drawn as seen at intervals in those shaded or retiring passages of the foliage where the Grey has been used , but never across the light or sunny parts . With the Grey and Green mixed , you may now mark the shadow touches in between the masses , taking advantage of those parts where the former tints may have run accidentally and irregularly together , and being careful to make those near the edges of the tree somewhat fainter than those in the centre . Olive Green or Brown Pink mixed with a little Indigo will now be useful to strengthen and modify the green portions ; and the same , when mixed with Sepia or Vandyke Brown , may be employed to give the shadowings and markings on the stem and branches . In a winter scene , when the trees are denuded of foliage , the network of the small branches at the tops of them may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry , and applied with // a brush having its hairs spread out either by the fingers or by drawing them through a fine-tooth comb before working . Grass is also represented readily by similar means , as well as small trees on the summit of a cliff and in similar positions . Some of the most beautifully composed foregrounds are those in which clear water flows or ripples over small stones or pebbles . In this case the different stones should be defined simply by the shadows between them . A wash of Indigo and Brown Pink or Vandyke Brown may be carried over the portions of the stones supposed to be covered with water ; and while this latter wash is damp , a few touches of strong dark color may be matte to blend in some deeper and richer tones amongst the rocks and masses at the bottom . Lastly , a few lines erased horizontally , when the work is dry , will give the effect of clear water above the stones by the expression of surface . OF FIGURES IN LANDSCAPE . Small gures or cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving interest and life to his work . But in scenes of a highly romantic character ( as a wild rocky river or a foaming cataract ) figures are better altogether omitted . In mere studies from Nature , figures are also out of place . To a pastoral scene , on the contrary , living objects are indispensable : a group of cows beneath the shade ? the husbandman plodding homewards in the glowing eve ? the shepherd 's dog quickening the pace of the loiterers of his master 's flock ? may all be made to contribute to the delicious sentiment of such a scene . A single figure is often introduced as a scale of measure , to enable the spectator to judge of the real dimensions of large objects . A flock of sheep frequently and greatly accord with the character of a rural or even of a rocky or mountainous scene . An important use of bright color is derived from the circumstance , that the hue of any one particular tint may be materially increased by the immediate contrast of it with its complementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and purple by yellow . SUNSET . The student who really looks to Nature for color , and studies careLANDSCAPE // fully her combinations , will very rarely err materially in his work . Thus , at sunset , orange is the prevailing color , not merely in the sky , but also on all objects lighted by the sun 's rays . The proper contrast to orange is blue ; and accordingly we find that in Nature bluish or purple shadows are continually opposed to the warm orange lights . In a grey twilight , on the contrary , where the lights are sparkling but cold , the shadows partake of a warm or brownish hue . This principle must be borne in mind , as being one of the most important in painting . In all effects , then , which depend upon sunlight , contrast is the great object of attainment . By contrast is meant , not only the power possessed by cool tints of increasing the hue of warm ones , but also the powerful opposition of dark tones against the lights of the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky as follows : ? at the top , with cool grey , graduated into pale orange , tending to red towards the horizon . The colors are to be employed according to the instructions given in the preceding pages . The colors may appear warm , but let some well-defined distant mountains be now put in with a sombre grey , composed of French Blue and Madder Brown , with a very little Indian Yellow or Gamboge . The distant part of the sky will now be luminous , and what before was merely warmth will now become light . A middle distance of rocks , or wood , added with Vandyke Brown , Brown Pink , and Indigo , will cause the mountains to retire ; and the sky and other objects , reflected in a rocky river in the foreground , may complete the work . There are several methods of representing a glowing sunset . The sun may be painted with pure Chinese White , laid on sufficiently thick to hide the sky tint completely . This , when dry , is to be glazed with Cadmium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow , orange , or red is required . This method gives a much greater degree of brilliancy than can be obtained by mixing the white with the colors . Another way is to scrape out the lights of the sun 's disc ; and the part being smoothed , it may be tinted in the manner above described . Clouds of a cool tint are often observed about the horizon , sometimes partially obscuring or crossing the sun ; for these clouds Cobalt and Lake with a little White will be found effective , as they will increase the warmth of the luminary : they must 6o THE AMATEUR ARTIST not , however , look chalky , which would result from using too much White in the color . In studying such effects from Nature , where the color-box is not at hand , or when too much time would be lost in obtaining the requisite tints , the soft crayons with which colored crayon drawings are executed will be found of great service . The most powerful effect may be conveyed to paper by their aid in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were , afterwards studied and introduced at leisure with the ordinary water colors . Some artists possess portfolios of skies , put in this manner on tinted paper : they may be caught thus from a window at a moment 's notice , when all might have changed into sombre gloom long before color could even have been prepared on the palette . Moonlight or moonrise may be imitated in the same manner as sunset ; but Gamboge or Indian Yellow will be best for tinting the moon , over the lower portion of which a faint tone of warmth may , when the moon is near the horizon , be given with Light Red . The sky in moonlight may be laid in with Indigo and a little Vandyke Brown and Lake : dark clouds , with Lamp Black and French Blue . With the two latter colors alone various beautiful stormy skies may be represented ; the contrast of the blue causing the black to assume , if desired , a warm tone in shadows . CHAPTER IV . FLOWER PAINTING IN WATER COLORS . ON DRAWING SINGLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three simply grouped without background , the importance of copying Nature as exactly as possible must be impressed on the mind of the learner . It is true that for pictorial purposes , Nature often may , and often should be altered and adapted , judicious selections only being made from her vast stores ; but these liberties are for the eye , hand , and taste of experience alone ; the beginner must be content with endeavoring to copy as closely as possible the object of study , leaving out nothing ; for , as remarked by one of the greatest authorities , " in the practice of drawing or painting from Nature , there can be no doubt that , until correctness of eye and obedience of hand are attained , the closest possible , the most minute , imitation is the best " ; and until the taste is in some degree formed , it is highly dangerous to attempt to generalize . " We should he able to put everything we see in Nature into a picture before we venture to leave anything out . " Undeterred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to represent faithfully every incident of outline , and every variety of shade and color , however minute . The effect may often be spoiled at first by the greater difficulty of this plan of proceeding ; but a few failures will , in all probability , teach more than many apparently successful efforts . The student must , at first , be content with learning only . The reader must also be warned against being carried away by the very common and natural desire of sketching . Sketches are properly the notes ? the memoranda . or perhaps the recreation , of the experienced artist ; and facility , always so much prized and overrated by the amateur , is by no means an end at which to aim : if not a natural gift , it must at least be the natural result of well-directed efforts for general improvement . It is generally believed that considerable talent 6i // is necessary to make any progress in painting , but however valuable may be the higher qualifications of imagination in the more elevated walks of art , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural objects , yet , to do this not only tolerably , but even well , the only qualifications really necessary are a correct eye , a steady hand , and a moderate portion of common sense . One great and peculiar difficulty in representing flowers arises from their perishable nature ; they change so rapidly that in some instances , even while drawing the outline , the object of study is completely altered . Besides this difficulty , the splendor of some flowers is such that many pigments , which are extremely unmanageable , are for the sake of their brightness pressed into service , and many troublesome means must be resorted to in order to realize that brilliancy which constitutes their chief beauty . For these reasons , it is better to begin by selecting specimens as little complicated as possible ; whilst easier to imitate , they also require less time , so that there is a reasonable chance of completing the drawing while the model retains its freshness . MATERIALS . For materials and method of preparing them for use , see foregoing chapter on Landscape Painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : Chrome Yellow , No. i Crimson Lake , Indigo , Indian Yellow , Cobalt , Carmine , Vandyke Brown , Pink Madder , Sepia , Indian Red , Chinese White , Gamboge . The following also , though not often required , are indispensable for the painting of some particular flowers ; it is , therefore , well to be provided with them : // A little dissolved gum-arabic , or water-color megilp , and a small sponge , will also be found useful . THE PROCESS OF PAINTING . The light best adapted for painting is that obtained from one window only , the student being seated so that the light may come over the left shoulder . If there are more windows than one in the room , it is desirable that the light of all but one be obscured as much as possible , the object of study being so placed that no light can come behind it . By closing the lower part of the window , from which light is obtained in the usual manner of painters , much stronger effects of light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers are light and air , such effects can not certainly be so much in harmony with the ideas they suggest as those resulting from a more diffused light . Indeed , but for the difficulty of so studying them , nothing could be more desirable and beautiful than the effects obtained by painting them in the open air . A flower having been selected as a study , it must be placed as naturally as possible in a vase of water . Any small-necked vessel that will support the subject will answer the purpose . The first object now is good outline , which here means simply a correct one . The greatest pains must he taken to draw carefully and correctly every part of the flower , beginning generally in the centre , particularly if it is a full view which is to be represented . Every petal must have its own complete outline , not only indicated , but carefully defined . As regards improvement and accuracy , the drawing should be as nearly as possible of the size of the natural object . A small brush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flower , is the best instrument with which to draw the outline ; but until a little practice has given ease and readiness in use of the brush , an HB black-lead pencil will be found more convenient , as the markings from this are easily effaced . Care , however , must be taken that the lines drawn with the pencil are so pale as to be barely visible ; for nothing can be more disagreeable to the eye , or more unnatural , than a dark line , which no subsequent operation of the brush can efface . The flow &; should now be washed smoothly over with a tint match64 THE AMATEUR ARTIST ing as closely as possible the lighter tones of its own local color . This wash should be begun at the upper left-hand side , proceeding quickly to the right and downwards . Beginners generally experience a little difficulty in-this process at first ; but if attention be paid to keeping the brush equally full of color until it is completed , the difficulty will be easily surmounted . Beginners frequently exhaust the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is , that the new supply of color flows back into the former , leaving , when dry , a distinct mark , which is not only undesirable , but impossible to be obliterated without sponging the whole entirely out with clean water and recommencing . Fresh color must , therefore , be taken so frequently that no difference can be perceived between the tint of that which flows from the brush , and that which is already laid on ; the large pool left when the wash is completed ( so constantly a difficulty until dexterity in handling is obtained ) can be best disposed of by drawing the brush gradually to a fine point against the extreme outline . When the color thus laid on is perfectly dry , the shadows must be carefully painted in , and washed , in the manner already described , pains being taken to match their color with that of Nature . The shadows generally appear , in some parts , to be insensibly lost and blended with the pure color of the flower . This effect may be produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean brush ; rather dryer than that with which they have been painted . The local color may then be deepened where necessary , and the darker shadows may be worked upon until they are of the proper depth , and finished by small touches wherever great nicety is required . Some artists endeavor to finish their works entirely with soft washes , whilst others execute them completely with large or small touches ; * but perhaps a middle course between these extremes produces an effect more like Nature than either . A strict and constant study of Nature is the surest means of improvement ; for it is certain that there is always much more difficulty in really seeing Nature as she is than imitating what we see . To the practised and observant eye , every shade which once appeared but one monotonous tone of grey will contain a multitude of tints , each more // delicately beautiful than another ? a thousand gradations of light and shade will be discerned which were before invisible , and the discovery of new beauties in every part of the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imitation . The leaves must be executed in the same manner as the flower . When of a glossy surface , and therefore affording brilliant lights as well as shadows , they must be washed over with a very pale shade of cobalt and Indian red mixed , the veins only being left ( if they appear of a very bright green ) , and those lights which appear absolutely white . When this is dry , the local color , composed of chrome yellow , No. i , and indigo , must be laid on carefully , the lights only being left , The shadows must then be painted in with the same color or a little gamboge , and indigo , with a very small addition of Indian red ; then the veins , if dark , with the same color ; and the whole , finished with small touches , where necessary , as directed for the flowers . Some leaves are of a silvery greyish tone ; for these the local color must be composed of cobalt and chrome yellow , No. i , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have a less proportion of yellow than those of brighter leaves . When white is used it should be the permanent " Chinese white , " the only preparation which to undoubted durability adds facility in working . In order to assist these remarks , a few examples will now be given of the best and easiest method of painting some of the flowers most commonly met with , and most suitable for representation . THE PRIMROSE . The common primrose , being very simple both in form and color , is a good subject for a first study , if it can be procured . The outline being drawn carefully , beginning in the centre of the flower , and all the parts intended for coloring wetted with clean water , it should be washed over with a thin tint of lemon yellow such as will match the depth of the larger portion of the flower , leaving only those parts , if any , which appear to be white or nearly so . The color must be softened into these with a clean brush , as already explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobalt , pink madder , and a very little gamboge ; the two former being mixed together first , and // then the yellow added , always matching the tints used with those of the flower itself . When quite dry the yellow must be deepened where necessary , the green in the centre painted in with a little gamboge and indigo , and the deep yellow marks which surround it with gamboge alone . The local color for the leaves may be composed of chrome yellow , No . I , and indigo , with a very slight admixture of Indian Red : for the darker shadows , a little gamboge will be required instead of chrome yellow . THE YELLOW CROCUS . This flower is of a tone so deep that chrome yellow , No. 3 , must be used for the local color ; and after the shadows are finished with a mixture of pink madder and a very little cobalt , it must also be glazed with gamboge . A great number of flowers are variegated with orange and yellow . For these , the chrome yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , and the orange parts then painted in with chrome , No. 3 , glazing the whole , when finished , with gamboge . For scarlet and yellow flowers , the chrome must be washed over the yellow parts only , and after the scarlet is painted the whole must be glazed with gamboge . THE GERANIUM . The only color by which anything approaching to the brilliancy of the scarlet geranium can be obtained is pure scarlet . Exposure to the atmosphere , and the contact of metals , are the evils to be avoided in using scarlet . As soon , therefore , as the flower is finished , the bright shadows having been painted with carmine , and the dull ones with Indian red , it must be glazed thickly with a solution of gum-arabic , which will , by excluding the air , obviate the former difficulty . The latter must be provided against by never mixing it with a metallic color ; indeed it is safer always to use it alone . Many varieties of the geranium are of a beautiful rose color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by washing , first with a thin tint of scarlet ( sometimes very pale indeed ) , according to the depth or redness of the color , and then covering this with pink madder . The shadows of these flowers should be painted with pink madder , a very little cobalt , and still less of Indian yellow , mixed // together . The upper large and pencilled petals are redder and darker than the rest . The scarlet must , therefore , be laid on more thickly , washing them over afterwards with pink madder ; but great care must be taken to keep the white near the centre of the flower quite pure , both colors being softened into it with a clean brush . The dark patch of color in the large petals must then be laid on with carmine carefully softened ; and the beautiful pencilling must be imitated as exactly as possible , with a mixture of sepia and crimson lake . A very little gum68 THE AMATEUR ARTIST arabic may also sometimes be used to increase the transparency of very dark shades of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarlet must of course be entirely omitted , pink madder only being used for the local color . For those flowers partaking of a violet color , a little cobalt must be mixed with the madder , and the dark pencilling imitated with indigo and crimson lake . For the white varieties the reader is referred to the general directions for painting white flowers , using for the dark petals either of the mixed colors recommended above which most resembles Nature . I // THE ROSE . The rose is an extremely difficult flower to paint , because , whilst itself particularly perishable , the representation of it is equally tedious . The time necessary for completing the intricate outline often changes so completely the state of the flower , that it can scarcely be recognized . The student is therefore recommended , until a little advanced , to attempt this flower only in the autumn , when it is much more lasting than during the heat of the summer weather . In pink roses , the local color is best imitated with pink madder , a pale tint of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly white lights . When quite dry , the darker petals must be again covered with a deeper hue , and again with a deeper still the dark ones near the centre . Sometimes the color of these , in parts , is extremely red ; if so , a little scarlet must be washed over them first . The shadows must then be laid on ; but so great is the transparency of the petals , that very little grey will be perceived in them . A very small proportion of cobalt and Indian yellow must , therefore , be mixed with the madder with which they are painted , and for the darker ones carmine only may be used . For dark roses , crimson lake will be found the best color , instead of pink madder and carmine . Yellow roses should be painted in the same manner , with either lemon yellow or chrome , No . I , for the local color , the darker shades of yellow being finished with gamboge . The shadows can be painted with the same grey as recommended for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink madder , and a little gamboge . WHITE FLOWERS . In painting white flowers , it is unfortunately totally impossible to produce the brilliant whiteness of Nature . The paper on which the drawing is to be executed , and the purest white pigments , are only of the same degree of whiteness as the flower in its half shade ; if , therefore , either of these is used for the prevailing tone , which it most resembles , there will be no means left to represent , or even to attempt to imitate , the high lights . The whole flower , therefore , to be in keeping , must be painted a degree lower than Nature , and washed over // with a pale grey , just as the local color is laid on in other flowers , leaving only the high and most brilliant lights . For this grey the same colors may be used as before ? viz. , pink madder , cobalt , and a very little Indian yellow , mixing the two former together first , and then adding the yellow cautiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much warmer grey ? that is , with a less proportion of blue in it . In painting a white lily , chrome yellow , No. 3 , may be used for the anthers ; but in the white azalea or other white flowers , where they appear pale , a little Chinese white , mixed with chrome , No . I , will be more appropriate . // Very dark flowers , such as some poppies and hollyhocks , must be begun with a very pale wash of cold grey . Indigo , with a little crimson lake and sepia , will be a convenient mixture for this , as the same colors , although in very different proportions , must be used for the local color . In laying this on , care must be taken to leave the lights clear , and if any of these appear quite white , they must also be left in the first wash of grey , which will itself represent the lesser lights . COMPOSITION AND ARRANGEMENT . If after having , by practice and experience , attained some degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt to form groups and to make pictures , the reader must be reminded that arrangement and composition belong solely to the province of art . There are many forms of compositions used , but of these the pyramidal is the best , if not the only one adapted to the representation of flowers ; but , like all other artificial arrangements , it must be so carefully concealed as not even to be suggested to the eye . If symmetry demands precision and balance of form , attention must not be called to the fact , but the outline must be so varied and broken that it may pass unnoticed . Sharp or conspicuous lines of any length must always be avoided , either by interweaving them with others in the manner of Van Huysum ( whose forms are so graceful that even an engraving from his works is beautiful ) or by softening or concealing them entirely at intervals . Even the outline of one particular object , if clearly defined and sharp throughout , will be extremely disagreeable to the eye , and unnatural in its effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a manner as to sacrifice the drawing ; for an undecided woolliness of outline is another error equally to be avoided . The outline must be lost , and again reproduced , wherever a few sharp and sparkling touches will give force and interest . Great attention must be paid to perspective , which should be as correct in the drawing of a single rose-leaf as in that of a Gothic abbey . The group should appear round , and receding from the eye at the extremities . Neglect of this is a common error ; care , therefore , must be taken ( both in form and coloring ) not to bring these parts too forward , as if every object were on exactly the same plane . A diligent // observation of natural flowers , grouped together , will best give an understanding of the effect to be produced . The greater the variety of form , the more pleasing will be the effect . For pictorial excellence , it is therefore easier to group several kinds of flowers than to form a composition of one species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unavoidable monotony of form and limited range of color . The student should use judgment in selecting his flowers , as an illogical combination of wild and cultivated flowers , for instance , or of those whose periods of blossoming are not contemporaneous form not only an inharmonious but a ludicrous picture . The background , too , must harmonize with its subject . For who would place an orchid on a rush-matting or a stalk of corn-flowers on a velvet cushion ? This part of composition of whatever constituted must be strictly subordinate and assist the general idea , as also the coloring and forms whilst remaining itself almost unnoticed . In a few words , truth , elegance , and variety are the primary qualities which the student must seek to attain in the outlines or form of a composition of flowers . figure There are papers manufactured expressly for crayon painting ; and these have the advantage of greatly assisting the labors of the artist , and in facilitating his progress , especially by readily receiving the crayon . A preference for color in paper is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? blue , grey , buff , straw , olive , drab , and stone color ; but in the employment of strongly-colored papers there is no real advantage . A dark ground in flesh painting is more difficult to deal with than a light one . Blue paper has been extensively used , but it has this disadvantage . At the commencement of a drawing , the colors appear warm and harmonious by opposition ; but when the whole is covered , 73 // a grey tone prevails throughout the work , which deprives it of life-like warmth and freshness . In using a paper of a warm grey or yellowish tint , similar to that of canvases prepared for oil painting , the artist would be more sure of the results he might desire to accomplish . A good paper for portraiture , and agreeable to work upon , is the pumice paper . As the crayon tints arc rubbed in with the finger , it will be necessary , before commencing a picture upon a coarse pumiced ground , to rub clown with paper the rougher parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will quickly be abraded from the finger . Before proceeding to draw upon the paper , it must be mounted on a deal drawing-board , and secured by thumb-tacks . THE METHOD OF WORKING IN COLORED CRAYONS . The practice of painting in crayons consists of drawing the outline , laying in the tints in their graduated shades , and blending them into harmony with the forefinger of the right hand . Some artists use the finger covered with a portion of a white kid glove ; but the leather has this disadvantage ? in working very delicate colors , they are likely to become vitiated by other colors being carried into them by the glove . A rapid and ready method of executing small portraits consists in working the crayon lightly ( or chalk , for it is equally applicable to that material ) by means of a stump made of leather or grey paper . When the sketch of the features is made , the tints are laid in with the stump , and when the breadths are completed , the whole is modelled , retouched , and hatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine outline , to define form , and communicate sharpness here and there where it may be necessary , and ultimately to correct the drawing . But the student must be cautioned that the breadth of the stump is the rule ? the point of the crayon is the exception . If there be more than a certain proportion of sharp lines in a portrait , it becomes hard , and unlike nature . The execution of a life-sized head or portrait is thus carried out : the outline may be made with a firm crayon , either brown or red . Grey is also used ; hence it will be seen that the color of the crayon is entirely discretional . The drawing must be made lightly , in order // that the crayon does not enter the texture of the paper so as to render the markings difficult to be superseded subsequently by the necessary color . Black-lead pencil , for instance , would be unsuitable for this purpose , as the metallic surface that it leaves will not receive crayon . When the outline is complete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crayon and a stump , working especially for the degrees of shade . When the likeness is as satisfactory as it can be made in a first sketch , the complexion may then be proceeded with , beginning with the lights . The whites , yellows , reds , and greys must be worked in by superposition , and blended to an imitation of the reality of nature . From the highest lights , the student must proceed by gradations to the deepest shades , and these , in order to secure roundness and substance , must be put in equal in strength to nature ; after which , the middle tones must be very carefully blended , so as to unite the lights and shades by imperceptible gradations . The markings must be definitely made out , and the reflexes also , if there be any . As the fresher tints occur principally in the lights , it would be well to keep the color rather high , and of a warm tone , in order to reserve the brightest and most effective tints till the last . When all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat resembling mosaic ? when the head is in a satisfactory state as to form , color , and expression ? then , with the forefinger , or the little finger , the whole is passed over , and the colors worked and blended into harmony . In this operation the finger acts as a stump , and nothing else will be found so effective . The result of this treatment will be a flattening and softening of the whole work , the breadths as well as the outline , and also a marked reduction in the freshness and spirit of the color ; and hence the necessity of a forcible sketch to work upon . When this operation is concluded , the crayons will be again used to bring up the color and tone to those of the life ? to modify and correct those which may require retouching . Those passages which are heavy must be relieved , and those which may be too cold or too warm must be reduced to harmony . Working with the finger will be found at once the most available // method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the desirable result is unattainable by any other means . The errors into which a learner may fall arise from the constant and indiscriminate use of the finger . The results of this are as already stated ? the enfeebling of the drawing , the loss of outline , and the reduction of the tints to flatness and opacity . COLOR , AND THE COMPOSITION OF TINTS . The shade of flesh tints is warm or cold according to the warmth or coldness of the breadths of the light . If the lights be of a healthy hue , the shades may be warm , inclining to brown , mixed of various colors , broken with light red , carmine , yellow , and blue or grey . It is advisable generally to follow the Italian feeling ? of leaving the dark passages warm . The deepest shades even should be relieved by a certain transparency , obtainable by half-tints . Without such relief , they will always be expressionless and heavy . In feminine portraits or studies , the work must be brought up to the utmost brilliancy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , Naples yellow , vermilion , and madder , mellowed with yellows , or slightly empurpled with lake or carmine , according to the prevalent tint of the subject . In the masculine subject the colors will be stronger , and the halftints more positive . Great care must be observed lest the high and delicate passages be soiled or stained . They must only be approached by , and blended with , other shades at their extremities ; and these shades are , in most cases , half-tints . Those half-tints , or warm or cold greys , which are employed as intermediates to meet and reconcile tones of remoter degrees , must be qualified with the colors with which they are associated ; otherwise they will not harmonize . It will be obvious that , if the intermediate tint be too cold , it must be treated with the reds or yellows ; if too warm , reduced by grey or blue . The lights and shades should be carefully graduated , and harmony prevail throughout the work . DRAPERIES . BACKGROUNDS , ETC . The draperies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and decision than can be used in the features ; and this larger manner will , in contrast with the delicate drawing of the features , serve to give value to the latter . Backgrounds are not to be rubbed in mechanically , with the persuasion that any dark will relieve any light , or that any middle tint that may be cut by shade will suffice . It will be understood , as a general rule , that the background immediately round the head should be lower in tone than the half-tints of the face , and lighter than the shades , to give air and space ? to disengage the head . It frequently occurs that in passing repeatedly over , certain parts of the work , the paper becomes glazed or greasy , under the frequent application of the pastel , and thus refuses to receive the color . In this case , in order to restore a practicable surface , it will be necessary to rub it gently with pumice pounce , very fine glass-paper , or , what is still better , with cattle-fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . It is firm , and the surface does not become coarse by being rubbed . It receives color very agreeably , and retains it satisfactorily . In the selection of the vellum , some care must be exercised , in order to procure a skin entirely free from blemish , and as uniform in substance throughout as possible . If any thin parts occur towards the centre , it would be well to avoid placing on such a part any very prominent feature of the picture ; it were better , if possible , to model the face so as to avoid this part of the skin . In order to prepare a surface for the crayon , the skin must be fixed by a few nails to a perfectly smooth board or table . The reason why the board or table should be perfectly smooth is that any inequality of surface must tell upon the surface of the skin . Any indent will cause the vellum to be stretched , or left imperfectly rubbed up in that part ; any , even minute , elevation rising above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut through . There is a rough and a smooth side to the vellum , and it is scarcely necessary to say that it is the even smooth side that must be worked into texture , for which purpose the fine glass paper , known as No. i , is used . A piece of this paper , held in the fingers , and rubbed with // firmness on the skin , will break up the vellum into that rough surface favorable for reception of the crayon . The method of effecting this is to rub circularly ( not back and forward ) and thus to pass over the entire piece of vellum , until the whole presents a surface similar to , but much more uniform than , the wrong side of a piece of leather . When the face has been sufficiently roughened , it is transferred to a stretching frame , and strained over a backing of very fine canvas , or canvas over which smooth paper has been pasted ; and the vellum must be laid down so carefully , that no inequality exist in the cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easel . COLORING ON VELLUM . In treating of the manipulation of pastel , we confine ourselves properly to the method of working in this material . For feminine and youthful portraiture , vellum is preferable to paper ; it supports the delicacy and brilliancy of the complexion of women and children , and the surface better represents the fine textures natural to such studies . The drawing of the head may he made out with red chalk , or a hard grey crayon . The outline and first drawing will be superseded by color ; the lines , therefore , are slight , so as to be easily effaceable . In drawing , however , a head in which the color and workings are stronger than in feminine and youthful portraiture , charcoal or a dark hard crayon may be used . With the following colors and gradations , portraits and heads of any degree of force or delicacy may be executed : // figure In executing the portrait of a lady , after the first outline , draw and carefully make out , with color true to nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the breadths of the face , the gradations of shade had better be rubbed in first with some flat tinted grey , but short of the force and depth of nature . This must be done with the finger , and if the tones of nature be observed and followed , it will produce some resemblance to the sitter , as to the drawing , though perhaps , not as to the complexion . It is sometimes usual to commence the breadths of the face by rubbing in white where the brightest lights occur , as a suitable dead color for the high tints which must follow . Although the colors are reduced to tints and gradations in crayon painting , it must not be supposed that they can be laid in such a sequence on the vellum , and be so left ; they must be mixed and blended with the finger , for without manipulation of this kind , even the most cunning art in the mixture of tints avails little . The highest lights may be wrought with tints of vermilion and Naples yellow , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a softness in which neither the red nor the yellow shall prevail . According to the strength of the color which may tint the cheeks , the lighter degrees of vermilion or madder may be employed , and these must be blended and softened into the general complexion , working always with the finger . In order that the endless diversity of hue generally observable in a face may be successfully imitated , it will be necessary to follow nature by working yellows into reds , and reds into yellows , in such a manner as to leave neither color in undue preponderance . Having worked the lighter breadths into harmony , and nearly up to the force and brilliancy of nature , it will be necessary to harmonize the shadows . It was a principle of Vandyke that there was no color in the shade of flesh . This is the true principle of the shade of delicate tints : and , in order to realize this neutral , of which grey is always the base , the 8o THE AMATEUR ARTIST grey which was rubbed into the shaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or raw umber ; or , perhaps a tint of the three , composed with the finger on the vellum . The more strongly tinted masculine complexion may be imitated from the same selection of colors and tints , employing the stronger tones of yellow ochre , light red , vermilion , and lake . The shades and markings may be of umber , slightly qualified with lake or Indian red . When the coloring has been brought up as nearly as possible to nature , the features may be finished by defining the markings and drawing of the eyes , slightly forcing the shade which relieves the nose and rounds the shaded side of the head . The drawing of the mouth must be retouched , and the shades relieving the chin laid in to the strength of nature . The colors for light hair are formed of white , yellow , and the lighter tints of the umbers , burnt sienna , and black ; and for dark hair , the same colors in their strongest tones , as also Cologne earth , Vandyke and other browns . LANDSCAPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the soft powdery kind required in portraiture ; they are manufactured expressly for landscape ; and in their consistency resemble the substance of firm chalk . Indeed , as to substance and texture , the quality of chalk is a desideratum in these crayons . Between a material of such consistence and the paper , there is a certain affinity , technically called a " bite , " to which the artist is indebted for much of the beauty of his work . The following is a list of the most useful crayons ; and it will be observed that among them there are very few bright and positive colors : WHITE . White Italian Chalk . STRAW COLOR AND LIGHT YELLOW . Pale and middle , deepening to sober full yellows of the yellow and brown ochre hues . BLUE . Bright azure tints of varied strength , pale and dark . GREY . Pale and deep , of blue , neutral , and warm tones . // REDS . Vermilion tints , pale and middle . Indian red , various degrees . BLACKS . Conte crayons , Nos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian chalk is used not only for the lightest touches , but to blend and qualify all the other crayons into which it may be worked . The black Conte chalks are also of the utmost importance . Nos. i and 2 , the harder degrees , are used for outlining ; and the softest degree , No. 3 , may be blended with many colors to reduce their tones . The methods of using this material will be explained as we proceed . THE PAPER . Any of the soft machine-made drawing-papers may be used ; but it is indispensable that the tone of the paper will be such as will support and bear out the colors of the crayons . The paper , in fact , must supply an available middle tint ; for , in this manner of crayon painting , the color of the paper appears through almost every passage of the finished work . If , therefore , the tone of the paper be either too glaring or too dull , it will be altogether unsuited for an effective and harmonious picture . The paper upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft paper of a low-toned olive tint , which has been found , by long experience , to be better adapted than any other for landscape drawing , as affording an agreeable neutral , upon which warm or cold tones , lights or shadows , may be placed with the best effect . The paper is attached to a deal drawing-board , by means of pins placed at intervals round the edges . The paper must be larger than the intended drawing ; for from the necessarily spirited manner of working , the exact dimensions of the drawing are sure to be exceeded ; but , when finished , this margin is cut off . THE SKETCH AND EXECUTION . The composition must be very lightly defined with the Conte crayon , No . T the whole of the objects being made out just sufficiently to guide the artist in the flat tints of the sky and distances . // The difference between the crayons used in portrait painting , and those employed in landscape , has been already spoken of ; and the difference in the manipulation must now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the value of this difference will at once be understood , as soon as the crayon is applied to the paper . The breadths of the composition are not laid by working with the point of the crayon ; but a portion of the crayon , sufficient for the purpose required , is broken off , and applied flat , or lengthwise , to the paper ; being held between the thumb and two fingers . In this manner it is worked lightly over those parts of the drawing which it is desired to tint ; and the spirit and lightness of the tint is derived from the hardness of the crayon , which is " bitten " by the surface of the paper , and leaves on it a moderate quantity of color . This tint is rubbed vigorously with the two forefingers , so as to work the color well into the texture of the paper . For the same purpose , also , the breadth of the thumb is employed , and the fleshy part of the palm of the hand . As the operation leaves but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary strength of tone is obtained , varying and blending the colors by working them into each other , as the subject may require . By this means , the flat or fundamental tints of the sky are laid ; upon these are superposed the clouds , and passages of aerial effect , by means of pieces of crayon used lengthwise in the manner above described , working them obliquely , horizontally , or vertically . In this way may be obtained such effects as are procurable by flat tints in water or oilcolor . The fundamental breadth of the sky may be brought below the line of the horizon ; and it will thus serve as a base whereon to mark the distant mountains , or other extreme passages of the composition ; drawing the remote forms with pieces of crayon , held flat or lengthwise . These tints are blended with the fingers , and the tones repeated where necessary . The distant ridges of the mountains being made out , the middle distance and the nearer objects are approached by the neutral tints ; still drawing with broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the feeling to be expressed . The broken pieces of // crayon , are used as drawing tools , just as brushes and pencils are employed in oil and water-color painting . The sky and distances exclude the more decided markings which occur as we approach the foreground ; there the black Conte , Nos. r and 2 , are used ; and in the near parts of the picture these are very important . With these Conte 's all the striking features of the near composition , such as trees , rocks , and buildings , are drawn , and the material is used in the manner already described ; that is , in its length and breadth ? broken into fragments , suitable in size to the object to be drawn . Where any fine lines arc necessary , these are not made by the crayon cut to a point , but by the sharp edge of the fracture of the crayon . Each object , after having been drawn in with the Conte , is then appropriately tinted or colored , by working over the black markings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is performed is like the operation of . glazing in oil painting ; because under the light network tracery of the colored crayon the Conte drawing is still visible . By blending , and again drawing with Conte , and again glazing , as often as may be necessary , we approach the finish of the picture , which is completed by sharp and spirited touches of light , put in with the sharpest parts of the fractured end of the colored crayon . It is advisable that beginners should , for their initiatory essays , select easy subjects , in order to acquire neatness of execution , which is indispensable in crayon landscape drawing . The color should be used but sparingly , and the black chalk should appear as a prominent material in the drawing . And if over the black markings the colored crayon be lightly drawn , color enough will be left to tint the object , without concealing or breaking up the Conte drawing beneath ; the surface-color forming a light network tracery over the black . The result of the application of the crayon lengthwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of the hog-hair brush in oilpainting ; and this touch is made to vary in breadth , according to the manner in which the piece of crayon is held ; as it may be worked flatly in its entire length on the paper , or held transversely at any angle , to yield a touch of any breadth , varying from the finest line to its entire length . Perhaps the great charm and novelty of this method of drawing is // the successful imitation of the transparency of oil-painting . By attempting to load , or rub in color in finishing a work , this beautiful effect is destroyed . The texture of the crayon does not admit of massing color ? the beauty of the work depends upon the paper being yet perceptible through the ultimate finish . It is only in the last sharp finishing touches or points of light that color in quantity and force is required . All the colors laid in the earlier and progressive stages of the work should be laid with a view to the acquisition of transparency . Any markings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger , and , when necessary , tints may be worked into those previously laid , leaving wholly or partially all that is necessary for the drawing or color . These markings and retouchings are repeated until the desired effect be obtained ; but it must never be forgotten that by an extravagant loading or rubbing in of color the transparency of the work is lost ; the result being a coarse , smeary , and opaque effect . TO FIX CRAYON DRAWINGS . To fix and solidify crayon drawings has long been a desideratum . As it is now practised , we shall give the best known recipes . The means which have been employed with greater or less success are transudation , or moistening at the back , immersion , aspersion , and steaming . But which of those means soever may be used , the result will always be a reduction and flattening of the tones ; the brilliancy of the lights will be reduced , and the shades will be deprived of much of their depth . It will therefore be necessary to retouch those passages which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material that in anywise approaches the qualities required in a fixing liquid is isinglass , which is employed in the following man-ner : FIXING BY TRANSUDATION . Infuse an ounce and a half of the best isinglass , during twenty-four hours , in five ounces of distilled vinegar . Add to this one quart of hot water , and keep the liquor at a gentle heat , but not warmer than can be borne by the finger . Stir it often with a wooden spatula until the isinglass he entirely dissolved , then filter it through paper . // When the liquor is filtered , it is put into a large bottle , pouring in alternately a glass of this compound and a glass of spirits of wine . The bottle may then be corked , and the liquid shaken for about seven or ten minutes , to mix the whole sufficiently . This terminates the composition of a fixing liquid , which , if skilfully employed , will be found to answer the desired end extremely well . When this mixture is to be used , place the picture horizontally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides or corners so that the color does not touch the table . The liquid is then applied to the back , with a brush of about an inch in diameter , until the liquid has penetrated through to the crayoned surface , and all the colors become moistened and shining , as if varnish had been passed over them . The first application will penetrate quickly , in consequence of the dryness of the paper , and the absorbent nature of the colors . This is repeated , but with less liquid , and every care must be observed to spread the mixture with great evenness over the back of the picture , in order that there be no stain . When this process is completed , the work may be turned with its face upwards , and allowed to dry . It sometimes occurs that there are colors which are not properly set by being once subjected to the process . In such case , it becomes necessary to apply the mixture again in the same manner as before . When the process is concluded , there may still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the liquid . Some of these particles might become detached from the background , and cause mischief to the flesh colors . They must , therefore , be removed by passing the finger over the background , in the same manner in which the picture was painted . This method of fixing pastel drawings is simple , easy , and tolerably certain . The change which it causes in the picture is inconsiderable , and the firmness is such that the pictures may be cleaned without injury to the colors . Pastel drawings mounted upon canvas may be treated in the same way , if the canvas has been prepared with starch . Should the drawing have become flattened in tone , or should it appear that a greater degree of decision or force is anywhere required after the work has been fixed , a portion of crayon may be dissolved in a small quantity of this liquid , and in this way the crayon may be // employed , like body color , to touch upon and strengthen these parts which may require additional force . FIXING BY IMMERSION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alum as the water will dissolve . When the water has become saturated , pour it off carefully , in order that no particles of undissolved alum may remain in it . Add about half an ounce of good isinglass , and let it remain thirty-six hours . Warm this compound in a water-bath , in order that the isinglass be thoroughly melted ; strain it through fine muslin and pour it into a glass bottle , into which there has already been put three pints of pale brandy , or spirits of wine . In order to effect the immersion , a large , flat dish may be used ; but a large zinc pan would be better . Into this is poured the fixing liquid , which has been previously heated in the water-bath , every care being taken that no deposit is admitted . The picture is held horizontally , the crayoned surface downwards ; it is dipped into the mixture , and quickly withdrawn in the same horizontal position . It is then placed in the shade . and when dry ( it can be determined whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the crayon ought not to come off ; and if the process has been properly conducted , no great change will have taken place . After having been fixed in this way , pictures executed in pastel may be varnished . If this be desirable , the picture should first receive a coat or two of a strong solution of isinglass , to which is added onethird of spirits of wine , or of good pale brandy . When this is dry , it may he varnished . Crayon pictures thus fixed , but not yet varnished , can be retouched with the pastel , dry , or moistened with the fixing liquid , as already described . FIXING BY ASPERSION . Dissolve in a water-bath two drams of isinglass , in a pint of water , and to this add two pints of spirits of wine . This compound is applied to the back of the picture by means of a brush , which , being dipped in it , the hair is bent back , and by being allowed to recover itself by its own elasticity , distributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BY STEAM . For this process , a tin vessel , with a tight-fitting lid , is necessary . From the side of this vessel , near to the lid , projects a pipe five or six inches long , having a small rose head , perforated with numerous small holes , after the manner of the common garden watering-pot . Into tins vessel is put two ounces of spirits of wine , and two drains of powdered sugar-candy . While tins compound is boiling , the steam which issues from the rose head of the pipe must be directed to the back of the picture , until the paper and the colors are perfectly saturated . Sometimes the steam is directed on to the pastel ; but it must not be allowed to condense and form drops . The picture must be held at such distance from the vessel , that too much of the steam be not deposited at once . If the steam has sufficiently penetrated the colors , they become perfectly fixed when dry . CHAPTER VI . CHINA PAINTING . MATERIALS . Lacroix colors are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in no branch of painting is it so essential to have good brushes as in china painting , where the surface offers so little assistance to the brush . Camel-hair brushes are the best , but good sable brushes are used extensively . A large round brush for painting grounds , two fine tracers , one for gold and one for color , a square shader , No. 6 , and a sable pointer , No. 4 , will suffice . Care of one 's brushes is a very important duty . After using , they should be thoroughly rinsed in turpentine , then carefully washed in 89 // warm water and Ivory soap . Rinse in clear water and point with the lips . Keep them away from dust , points up , in a tall vase or glass , so that nothing can come into contact with the hairs . GOLD . As the gold is really pure gold , ground down in flux and oil , it must be carefully cherished . Never use any of the implements used for gold , for any other purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove any considerable amount of gold that you wish to replace in your gold receptacle , but never wash the slab . Indeed it is better to have a separate box for gold and implements and put your gold palette away uncleaned . Keep a tiny vial of alcohol - in which to wash brush and palette knife . After a little use in this manner , the vial will be found to contain quite a deposit of gold at the bottom . The alcohol can then be poured off and the gold rescued for future use . The liquid bright gold is very much cheaper than the roman gold , but is very hideous , being seen only on extremely cheap pieces of decorated china . But used in conjunction with roman gold , it is quite a money saver . Say , for instance , you have the handle of a cream-jug to gild . Paint for the first fire , with liquid gold . Then have fired . Now put on a second coat of roman gold and fire again and burnish . You will find that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have incurred , had you used two coats of roman gold . For it is essential to have two separate coats and fires , properly to cover the china . I spoke of burnishing the roman gold after firing . When it returns from the kiln , it looks like a dingy yellow paint ; but by vigorous rubbing with the glass brush the gold comes out beautiful and gleaming . Gold can not be used over color unless an especially prepared " unfluxed " gold be used . Even then it has not the brilliancy of gold placed directly upon the ware . I find it much better to scrape away the color ( of course before firing ) , and then apply the gold to the bare surface . RELIEF GOLD . Gold in relief makes an exceptionally rich ornamentation . It is done in this wise : Take as much " paste for raised gold " as you think you require from the bottle , grind thoroughly , with muller , and add CHINA PAINTING nz enough Dresden thick oil to form a stiff paste . Then thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fine brush in ridges or dots , as you desire . It may be applied over color , before firing , if the color is well dried in a warm oven . Great care must be used to keep the paste lines smooth , and not patchy . After a fire the paste is gilded with the usual fluxed roman gold . Never use raised gold on tableware , as it cuts off with a knife and can even be chipped off by striking against other pieces of china . For enameled clots of white or color , which are beautiful when placed over a gold background , use the German relief-white or " aufsetz-weiss . " It can be used as it is , in the white , or tinted with turquoise , green , pink , or any delicate color . It is first mixed with taroil to a consistency which will admit of its being applied in relief and olor added as desired . Too much oil will cause the enamel to " spit " or bubble and destroy its beauty . Enamels should have but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a vitreous cement for applying them to the surface of the ware . They are used only on artpieces and run such great risks in the kiln that it is advisable for the amateur to shun them . They are often set into raised paste and the paste afterward gilded to form a setting for the jewel . THE WHEEL . From time immemorial the potter 's wheel has been in use . By its means , beautiful even bands and lines of color or gold may be applied to plates , saucers , cups ; in short , to anything circular in shape . The article to be painted is set upon the wheel . Then the hand holding the brush , charged with gold or color , is placed upon a rest at the side . The point of the brush is lightly rested upon the point of the circle nearest the rest and the wheel slowly turned with the left hand . And presto ! a beautiful , smooth , perfect circle has been described . If the student intends doing much work , I should certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the list of materials the reader doubtless noticed an item of silk for flushing . Therein is contained quite a chapter on china-painting . The silk required is a soft India or Sarcenet . It should be light col92 THE AMATEUR ARTIST ored or white and of a good quality . No silk with a twilled surface will answer . Old handkerchiefs make the very best pads to be had . If the silk is new , wash thoroughly in castile soap and water . After using with paint , it can be cleansed with turpentine and re-washed in warm soapy water . Never discard until the holes begin to appear . To make a pad , take a piece of fine cotton batting about the size of a peach and smoothly cover with a six-inch square of silk . Gather in the edges and corners and tie firmly with a thread . See that there are no folds or wrinkles on the bottom or working surface of the pad . Having applied the design to your china , take a large clean tile or palette and thoroughly grind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from one part Dresden thick oil to two parts of lavender oil . If color is too thick to flow smoothly from the brush , add more lavender oil . Now take a large brush and quickly and rather evenly paint on the color as desired . Then , taking up the pad by the tied-up end as a handle , dab lightly and evenly over the entire painted surface . Pad over whole surface and then if not as smooth and even as desired , go round and round until all is alike . If white spots appear , the cotton has become damp . Then you must open your pad , fold in wet side of cotton and readjust silk . Change the surface of the silk , too , if it becomes too charged with color . When desiring to blend two or more colors , either use separate pads or different spots of a large one , on different colors . About handles and feet , where a pad will not reach use a dry camel's-hair blender . Now you will probably find that your tint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case wipe the edges clean with a cloth slightly dampened with turpentine . In cleaning up in this way , it is very essential that it be done neatly , as it will all come out in the fire exactly as you leave it , finger-marks and all . If small corners must be cleaned that can not be reached with a rag on finger or brush , let the piece dry in a warm oven , then scratch out difficult places with a pen-knife . If the piece presents a dry powdery appearance after the fire , rub down some flux a little thick oil and lavender and paint and pad over with this exactly as you did in the flushing , and refire. // To be successful in flushing , have the china moderately warm . Sometimes the weather conditions are such that it is impossible for art expert to do successful flushing , as before electric storms . In this event put the china aside and turn to painting . In applying a ground that is not to be flushed , . rub color down in less oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep tint is desired , paint lightly for the first fire and deepen for the second . For if too much color is applied for the first fire , it is apt to chip off and leave little white spots of china showing through , which are utterly irremediable . Royal Worcester and all " matt " backgrounds are soft and waxy in appearance . The matt colors can be had in delicate blues , pinks , yellows and ivories . They are in powder form , put up in glass bottles . They form the grounding of most of the art pieces turned out by the celebrated factories of Worcester and Doulton . One method of applying them is to mix turpentine , or , better , lavender oil and English grounding oil in equal parts and paint and pad the china with this , exactly as you would for flushing . Then let the piece stand for ten minutes . Meanwhile rub down your powdery color dry , with the glass muller . Then , taking a piece of cotton batting , use exactly as you would a powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tacky " surface of the china . Then set aside or in a warm oven to dry . Coral pink , of the matt colors , can be fired but once . Oftener , and it loses its color . FIRING . And speaking of firing , I wish to advise the beginner not to attempt any himself if he can possibly find anyone within a hundred miles who can do it for him . It requires a great deal of experience , and many failures . For some pieces of work must receive a great deal of heat , while others demand less , and it is only the practiced operator who can handle his kiln satisfactorily . Better pack the china carefully in wooden boxes and send to the nearest kiln . But if it is impossible for the beginner to send to a nottoo-distant one , there are many excellent ones on the market , which with labor and patience any person of intelligence can master . // TO TRANSFER DESIGN TO CHINA . Make your design in pencil on a piece of smooth paper . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracing paper or ordinary tissue . Now , reversing ' the tissue paper , go over the lines on the wrong side with a soft pencil . Next paint your china over with turpentine spirits and let dry . Now place your tissue , with soft-pencilled side down , upon the china . Hold firmly in place , while with your hard pencil you run over the lines with a firm touch . You will now find the design transferred to the china . For conventional designs India ink is used with a brush to sketch in the design . Or it may be used to run over the lines transferred as above . This will give a line which is not so easily erased as is pencil . But for unconventional work it cramps and prevents easy outlines , tending to make edges sharp or hard . The India ink of course disappears in the fire , as do the pencil markings . DECORATIONS . The most popular decorations to-day are masses of flowers or fruit with softly tinted backgrounds running to strong tints at bases and edges , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there is the conventional . And at present there is a great revival of this style of decoration , enamels being used to portray conventionalized fruits and flowers . There is so much scope for the individuality of the painter , in this field , that it offers many charms for the beginner . But it is a very painstaking sort of work , as it must be very exact . Beauty of design must be supplemented by harmony of color , and accuracy of touch . // figure LESSON I A light room must be selected to paint in , and the table arranged so that the light may come from the left . There should be no carpets , curtains or upholstered furniture in the room , as all these dust gatherers are inimical to paint . A big painting apron with long sleeves is a delight , as it not only keeps one 's clothes clean , but suppresses the lint arising from woolen garments . So much for environment . Now to proceed to the lesson . Before attempting anything to fire , let the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square shader No. 6 and , say , some olive green . Grind the color well with your palette knife , upon the palette , and add about half as much of the painting oil which you have mixed in a little salt or butter dish . This has been mixed of about one part of Dresden thick oil to two ( or possibly a little more ) of lavender oil . See that your color flows smoothly . Now charge the brush with // color and practice different strokes . Try to make a complete leaf with one stroke of the brush . Then when dry , add the shadows at a stroke . Now , flattening the brush , and with the addition of a little black to the paint , use the fine sharp side of it to make the veins and a hint of an outline . Keep the work clean and clear . Fussing over it will destroy the effect of clearness and freshness . Practice differently shaped leaves and flowers , as the daisy , wheatear , violet leaf , rose leaf , etc Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , until you have learned to use your brush . The touch must be firm and decided , and the only way to acquire it is by practice . I would say another word here about our mutual enemy , dust , or lint : While painting is in progress no one should be allowed to stir about , especially when a delicate piece of flushing is in progress . If , as sometimes will happen , particles of lint settle upon the paint , they should be removed with the point of a needle . For , if allowed to dry in and be fired , the particle itself disappears , but you will find that it has gathered unto itself . quite an accumulation of color , which will show up very badly in the fire . LESSON II . Select a tile and draw or transfer the design of the accompanying cut to it . Then grind some Lacroix dark blue with the prescribed quantity of Dresden and lavender oils . Paint in background below horizon line . Use a broad brush and paint in smoothly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , with less oil , to insure a deeper color , paint in the hair , dress , bundle and shoe of the figure . Proceed to lay in the flat tints of the scroll and title . With a fine brush paint in all outlines . Remove with a knife the white lines in foreground which represent the stubble . Now the tile must be fired . When it returns from the kiln add delicately with a small square shader the shadows on the face and those on the apron , bundle , shoe and dress . Now , using the edge of the same brush , put in lines of hair , dress , kerchief , bundle , grass , etc . Also paint in the wheat , and the defining lines of the distant landscape . Proceed in the same manner with title and scroll , finally adding the border . // LESSON III ON ROSES . This will mean quite a jump from a simple tile in monochrome , to a plate of roses . But if one has any knowledge of painting in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First prepare your palette ? and I hope you have bought for one dollar , one of the covered ones . For by so doing , you can keep your paint moist and free from dust from one day to the next , and thus need not throw it away . Even if it should dry a little , it can be ground up with a little turpentine . // Do not make the mistake of taking out a greater amount of paint than you need , as that is extravagance . Yet to take out too little wastes the time required to replenish the palette . Find a happy medium and adhere to it . Take a little ruby purple ( as it is expensive ) , some banding blue , powder black , purple black , lemon yellow , apple green , olive green , yellow green , moss green , yellow brown and peach-blossom pink . Thoroughly grind each color with the medium before mentioned . The powders require more Dresden thick oil . Do not be afraid of grinding up the colors . They require thoroughness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without a flange ) , sketch or transfer a design that shall form a wreath of roses and leaves . Place the roses in about five clusters of two or three roses each , and connect them with sprays of leaves and trailing stems . Now with your flat shader paint in one or two roses of each cluster with the peach-blossom pink . The secret of delicacy in china painting lies in the faintness of the first coat of paint . So make this first very delicate . Use peach blossom and a little ruby purple for the deep shades in the centre and for a few defining touches . This is enough for the pink roses for the first fire . Now taking peach-blossom pink and a little ruby purple , faintly , but not so faintly as for the pink ones , paint in the ground of the red rose . This should be crowded close to the pink one for contrast . Make centre of ruby purple and a bit of black . ( Ruby-purple should never be used clear , as it is too vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define the rose . Now turn to the leaves . They are by far the most difficult . Those above the roses should be kept lighter in tone than those below , and they all should form a complete setting for the roses , allowing no break in the background they make . immediately about the flowers . This will round out the blossoms . Now put in a few olive green leaves . Simply map them in . Then with moss green and ruby purple map in a few below the roses . Now taking a bit of banding blue and ruby purple and a bit of black , to make a purply shadow , clot in a few shadowy sprays about the edges of the design . Some brown leaves also help in the foliage effect . A few prominent good-sized leaves may be faintly tinted with yellow green for the first fire , some tipped with lemon yellow . A little banding-blue with apple green makes a light aerial green for the upper part of the design . A few // vine-like stems with projecting thorns may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like manner with each group , until all the design has had a faint color put upon it . Now let dry and if you desire any gold on the plate , apply a line of liquid gold to the edge . Stippled gold is away out of fashion . Send to fire . When the plate returns , have palette arranged as before . Now shade the pink roses with peachblossom pink and ruby purple . The red ones with ruby purple and purple black ( mixed with the brush ) . Add shadows to the olive green leaves of olive and purple and black mixed . Also vein with same , using sharp edge of brush or a fine pointed liner . Purple and black with a suggestion of olive will do for shading and defining the moss green and ruby purple leaves . The pale brown leaves may be shaded with olive and a bit of black . The lighter leaves may be veined , shaded and slightly outlined with moss green and olive , or moss green and a bit of black . The black is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? never alone . Now about the deeper portions of the work , and right over the shadows that have been fired , paint in soft cloudings of banding blue and purple , mixed . A few dark splashes of green and banding blue among the shadows , below the design , will tend to throw it out . A little brown and ruby may be clouded in above , as well as some lemon yellow . Now taking a pad , blend these shadowings together so as to nearly cover the plate . But be careful not to venture near the design with your pad , as you would blot out all your work . Let dry , go over the bright gold with a coat of roman gold and send plate to be fired . When it returns burnish the gold with glass brush and the work is complete . SOME COLOR HINTS . Ruby purple and banding blue are mixed for violets . A few of pure banding blue are interspersed . Shadowy ones are made of banding blue mixed with a little black , also of brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also painted of banding blue , purple and black . Anemones are painted with Rosa or peach-blossom , shaded with a little ruby purple . The centres are of lemon yellow deepened in the shadows with yellow brown , and brown green . roa THE AMATEUR ARTIST Jonquils are painted with Lacroix jonquil yellow , yellow brown for depth of color and yellow brown with a bit of black for shadows . Pompadour red makes beautiful dashes of red color in cloudings for grounds . For painting in dark grounds use anise oil and lavender oil to mix color , and use anise on brush . Lacroix deep red brown makes a rich red for solid grounds . CHAPTER VII . PEN-AND-INK DRAWING . Of late years several influences have tended to raise the importance of Pen-and-Ink drawing as an independent art . Chief among these is the gradual substitution of photo-chemical processes for the hand work of the wood engraver ; the cheapness which has resulted , has occasioned an enormous increase in the number of illustrated books and periodicals . There are two distinct methods of obtaining effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other by many lines drawn with rapidity . If the intention is to see what effect may be obtained with comparatively few lines slowly and deliberately laid , we may refer from amongst the Old Masters to the woodcuts after Albert Durer and Holbein , and the line engraving of Marc Antonio . The engraved plates by Diirer furnish us excellent examples of work with more and finer lines than his woodcuts . Some of the etchings of Rembrandt are on the other hand perfect samples of what may be fairly reproduced in penand-ink . In them we find the effect to depend upon innumerable lines in all directions . For economy of line with extraordinary power of suggesting a great deal with very little work , perhaps Mr. Caldecott 's designs rank as high as any . The illustrations by Adolf Menzel to the life of Frederick the Great are perfect mines of study . // It is excellent practice occasionally to make pen-and-ink studies very rapidly from nature without any previous pencilling whatever . I have found this equally useful in landscape or figurework . Studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion , but are rarely deficient in emphasis . Before commencing a design , for a book illustration , for instance , it is not a bad plan to make some preliminary studies in this hurried manner ; and then after the careful drawing has been completed with all the finish that an unlimited bestowal of time can effect , to compare the two . It will usually be found that there is something in the first , unsatisfactory as it seemed perhaps when just done , that may with advantage be incorporated into the second . Touching the question of direction of lines as indicating that of surface , observe these few points : " If lines are to be distinctly shown , it is better that , so far as they can indicate anything by their direction , they should explain rather than oppose the general character of the object . And Albert Diirer , whose work was chiefly engraving , sets himself always thus to make his lines as valuable as possible , telling much by them , both of shade and direction of surface . But inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without lines , you will find that the great painters do not much trust to direction of line , but will often scratch in the shade of a rounded surface with nearly straight lines , that is to say , with the easiest and quickest lines possible to themselves . When the hand is free , the easiest line for it to draw is one inclining from the left upwards to the right , or vice versa from the right downwards to the left ; and when done very quickly , the line is hooked a little at the end by the effort at return to the next . Fence , you will always find the pencil , chalk , or pen-sketch of a very great master full of this kind of lines ; and even if he draws carefully , you will find him using simple straight lines from left to right , when an inferior master would have used curved ones . Even the careful drawings of Leonardo da Vinci are shaded most commonly with straight lines ; and you may always assume it as a point increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find rounded surfaces , such as those of cheeks or lips , shaded with straight lines . " Our illustration , by Mr. E. J. Gregory , is an excellent example of // simplicity in execution , the lines hardly ever being crossed , and yet a great deal of variety in tone and texture being attained . As in the case of writing with the pen , we are often able to recognise at a glance the individual hand , so , and much more so , should it be with a drawing . This strong point is sure to be attained unconsciously caption if an artist 's work is simple and sincere , and not the mannered imitation of another 's style . When making a pen-and-ink drawing , or any study in black and white ( other than outline ) , there are two distinct motives which should be kept apart in the mind of the student , though in his work they are // bound to overlap each other more or less . The first is the representation of the light and shade , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is important to dwell on these two different aims , because I have often noticed an absolute confusion in the use of the terms amongst students and amateurs , such as is shown by the remark , " I thought the black and white of a picture meant the same thing as its light and shade . " A couple of examples will make my meaning more clear than any amount of explanation . In Mr. Charles Keene 's drawings in Punch , particularly in his early ones , he made no difference in the treatment of a black silk hat and a straw hat of pale yellow , or between a black coat and a smock frock ; every object having the half which is turned towards the light left white , or nearly so , while the other half has a medium tint of lines to represent shade . If this treatment be contrasted with Mr. Du Maurier 's later drawings , the difference that I mean will be seen at once.In the latter we find black coats represented as nearly uniformly dark , while a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality most essential is color , so in pen-and-ink drawing or etching , it is the suggestion of color which i the most caption PEN-AND-INK DRAWING ion important . The main reasons for this seem to be , firstly , that we see all objects in nature as variously colored masses , our perception of the local color remaining through all the changes of light and shade ; secondly , that the light and shade is more subject throughout to fixed rules than the color , and so the translating of the different colors of a picture into black and white shows us infinite varieties of subtle and broken tones with occasionally startling and pleasing surprises . There are however some cases in which the light and shade and the black and white of a subject are pretty nearly identical in tone ; as , for instance , in the portrayal of sculpture , or in the representation of an interior lighted from a single small window , and where the principal objects happen to be draperies and furniture of a lightish color . In the latter case we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given by a head of black hair , or of light value as a white cap ; because they tend to give suggestions of delicate color to the rest of the picture . Many of the etchings of Whistler depend for their effect upon large spaces of paper being left white , and the judgment with which this is done shows mastery quite as much as the lines actually drawn . An excellent example is shown in the picture of his mother . To express the greatest number of facts with the smallest possible number of lines , and to put down those lines with perfect freedom of handling , is to be master of the art . I can not conclude these general remarks better than by again quoting from our great art teacher , who after telling the student not to be impatient with his pen and ink , " for all great painters , however delicate their perception of color , are fond of the peculiar effect of light which may be got in a pen-and-ink sketch and in a woodcut , by the gleaming of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following emphatic piece of advice : " Do not , therefore , think that your drawing must be weak because you have a finely-pointed pen in your hand . Till you can draw with that , you can draw with nothing ; when you can draw with that you can draw with a log of wood charred at the end . " io6 THE AMATEUR ARTIST PRACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS . As most of the pen-and-ink drawings are now done with a view to reproduction in the printing-press it should materially assist the student to understand how this is brought about . The following is a simplified description of the ordinary line block ' method : ? A photographic negative is first taken of the drawing , in which the aim is to secure perfectly clear glass where the lines are , and an opaque black for the white paper . A polished plate of copper or zinc is coated with a thin film of gelatine to which a small percentage of bichromate of potassium has been added . This metal plate is then put into a photographic printing-frame under the negative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the light . After sufficient exposure it is removed from the printing-frame and placed in warm water , when the unexposed parts of the film dissolve away , leaving only lines of gelatine hardened and insoluble where the light has pellet . ated . When dry it is submitted to the action of a corrosive liquid ( perchloride of iron ) which attacks the metal where free from gelatine , and so eventually lowers the surface of all but the lines : these remain standing to be printed from , along with the raised type of the letter-press . The importance of perfectly black lines and clean white paper can hardly be exaggerated from the technical point of view . A pen drawing may be either sketched in pencil to be removed afterwards with india-rubber , or made in pencil on another piece of paper and traced . If the first plan is adopted , a soft pencil must be used and the drawing should be lightly touched , as hard rubbing with the india-rubber may affect the ink lines . There is a third method , that of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then choosing a thin semi-transparent paper on which to make the pen drawing . This is laid over the pencil study so that it may be seen through and may serve as a guide for the finished drawing . Even tracing paper itself is said to be used in this way , but it must be the comparatively thick sort which is a bluish white rather than yellowish in color . In making corrections a very sharp pen-knife should be used : if white is used , such as Chinese White or Winsor &; Newton 's Albanine. care must be taken to keep the touches sufficiently opaque . It is // curious how any flaws such as broken lines or patched-up places seem to get exaggerated reproduction : ? hence it is very often worth while to stick a clean piece of paper over a damaged spot and re-draw the unsatisfactory passage . The special requirements in an ink for line reproduction are an intense black which shall photograph well , and sufficient fluidity to work easily and not clog the pen . Some varieties are praised because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I have never found that a slight shine on the surface has affected the photograph . There are many inks specially prepared for the purpose . Winsor &; Newton 's " Process Black " is much used , and " Higgins ' Drawing Ink " is very excellent . Whatever make is employed it is wise to shake the bottle before beginning to work , as there is generally caption some tendency to separate into a watery fluid and a thick deposit . Mr. Ruskin , in his Elements of Drawing , ' sets the pupil down for a considerable time to the simple task of laying a flat tint by means of pen and ink . He advises the student to draw a square and try to fill it in with crossed lines so completely and evenly , that it shall look like a square patch of grey silk or cloth , cut out and laid on the white paper . He is to cover it quickly , first with straightish lines in any direction he likes , not troubling himself to draw them very closely or neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lines in all directions , care being particularly taken that each set of lines be in turn allowed to dry thoroughly before being crossed by another set . rob THE AMATEUR ARTIST In this exercise swiftness of execution is recommended to avoid the dot of ink liable to be left by the pen at the end of any line which is drawn slowly , even though the pen-knife should be occasionally called into requisition to remove the ends of such lines as have gone over the edge of the square . The pen-knife should not , however , be used till the last thing ; as , where the surface of the paper has been disturbed by it , fresh lines are apt to run into blots . A few delicate washes added to an elaborate drawing in Indian ink . will often produce a good effect by blending some of the tints together and by softening the shaded parts will somewhat obliterate the evidence of excessive labor . Such washes must , however , be applied with caution , care being taken not to go over any part a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy may be lghtened somewhat with india-rubber , and still more with gentle use of ink-eraser . In Mr. Hamerton 's Graphic Arts , ' attention is called to the value of " the black blot " as a technical means in pen-and-ink drawing . We have flat whites in abundance ; why not admit flat blacks ? All that the artist means by them , is that at those places the ( larks of Nature went down below a certain level . The holes and corners of picturesque buildings are darker than Indian ink with the light upon it , and so are the shady side of all caption dark draperies ; other darks come nearly no to Indian ink , and others ( greys and browns in nature ) are just equivalent to it . The flat black represents all these together , quite as fairly and legitimately as the flat white represents luminous greys and greens . " Since the idea of book decoration has largely superseded that of merely pictorial illustration , the use of the black blot is frequently resorted to without any realistic regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is often boldly used for the simple purpose of satisfying the eye with its rich full effect . Mr. Herkomer 's " Happy Old Age , " is a very effective instance of the use of the black blot . Mr. Ruskin strongly advocates the invariable use of a perfectly black ink , recommending , for instance , ordinary writing ink that has been allowed to stand till it has become thick ( but not so much as to clog the pen ) believing that " if you can not gradate well with pure black lines , you will never gradate with pale ones . " A very smooth hand-made paper is perhaps the best surface for pen-and-ink drawing . The granulated surface of rough paper is apt to give the lines a broken appearance , and to hinder the free movement ofthe pen . Bristol boards are perhaps the most generally useful , while London boards are to be preferred for any work not especially minute in detail . These cardboards have the advantage that the drawings made on them do not need to be mounted afterwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamped and stretched . The be afterwards reproduced by photo-mechanical processes . It is said to be a coating of china clay with which the surface of the paper is prepared ; and its specialty is that black lines can be easily erased with a penknife , while white lines or clots can be added with a needle in any parts that happen to be too dark . A powerful effect which is sometimes useful can be obtained by putting in a solid black ? preferably lamp black with a brush ? over large spaces of the drawing and then working out the details with white lines produced by a sharp point . Some of Mr. Heywood Sumner most striking decorative drawings are said to have been clone this way . Winsor &; Newton 's Albanine ' can also be used to produce white lines of varying thickness on a black ground : for this purpose it is much superior to ordinary Chinese White , as it flows more readily from the brush owing to its having less gum or glycerine mixed with it . As regards pens , a careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Gillott Mapping pen  --  Gillott 192 , coarse r ro THE AMATEUR ARTIST but still small point ? Gillott 303 , a shade larger , a very good average size ; the last-named have less spring , and so give a more uniform set of lines when required . Gillott 404 is as coarse as is likely to be useful . Messrs . Perry &; Co. manufacture some pens expressly for drawing , which they have numbered thus : boo Crow-quill pen , 601 Eaching pen , and 602 Tracing pen , all these being admirably suited for fine work . The penholder sketched is made by Messrs . Woodward , who call it the IXL ; it is convenient to the fingers , as being a holder of the usual size , while the pen is a small Crow-quill . One advantage of Gillott 's larger pens over the crow-quill is that they do not require replenishing with ink so often . It is a good plan to use different pens for different parts of a drawing , just as an etcher uses different needles on different parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be utilized , even occasionally the broad-nibbed J. For producing a bold line of even thickness stylographic pens of different makes are often employed . The solid glass pen with grooves which hold the ink may be classed with them . It is generally felt to be rather hard and unsympathetic irk the handling , but is said to be preferred by the celebrated Vierge , possibly because of the property that pens of this class have of allowing the stroke to be made with equal facility in any direction . Though the lines made with the glass pen are as a rule of the same thickness , yet a very rapidly drawn line will often be perceptibly thinner ; and there are sometimes slight irregularities in what should be its perfectly round point , so that it will be found that by shifting the pen a little in the fingers a thicker or thinner line may be produced at will . For very large work , especially in ornamental lettering , the oldfashioned reed pen is useful ; it works very freely and so saves time . The character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecclesiastical purposes , is particularly well rendered by the reed pen . The preparation known by us as Indian ink is really of Chinese manufacture . The true China ink will break to almost a polished surface , and is moderately scented with musk . Indian ink has one quality which is sometimes found to be a disadvantage . It is extremely di Eficult to remove when once applied to the paper , being very little PEN-AND-INK DRAWING . affected by the use of a wet brush , sponge , or blotting paper . In this respect , it is the antithesis of charcoal grey , which is a beautiful pearly grey color for monochrome , but attaches itself to the paper so slightly that a second wash , if not very dexterously applied , is pretty sure to disturb the first . " Ivory black is obtained by charring ivory in closed retorts . It is a full silky black , and is serviceable where the sooty density of lamp black would be out of place . It has a tendency to brown in its pale washes . " Lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so intense and transparent as ivoryt'black , but less brown in its pale washes . Liquid brown ink is gradually becoming popular , particularly for the caption purpose of perspective elevations of architects . Washes of this ink can be used along with the ordinary work of the pen . When compared with the other elevations outlined and tinted either with Indian ink or Sepia , those in brown ink certainly look the most effective . The warm tone of the brown ink , as used in this manner , is decidedly agreeable . The following is a list of the best Nankin Indian inks : Extra large Double Dragon , Hexagon , Super-super , Mandarin , Pearl , Stork gilt , Square gilt , Lion 's head , besides smaller sizes of several of these brands . The Super-super and Lion 's head brands are in practice found to be the most generally useful . T I2 THE AMATEUR ARTIST For such work in pure line as is required to be very exact for purposes of publication , it is not unusual to employ a finely-pointed sable brush instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few would imagine they were not looking at a pen-and-ink drawing . The sable brushes known as tracers , ' liners , ' or riggers , ' are specially adapted to this kind of work , all of them being very long in proportion to their thickness . Any small sable brush may be trimmed with a sharp penknife to the required proportion as shown in the accompanying illustration . Their shape facilitates the task of shading by means of parallel lines of regular width . With practice , considerable rapidity may be acquired ; and those who have once become accustomed to the use of the brush as a substitute for the pen , are seldom known to recur to the use of the latter . In this method of working , such pigments as Indian ink , lamp black , ivory black , are all available as substitutes for the fluid ink . Some draughtsmen add a little gamboge or crimson lake to whatever black pigment they use in order to ensure its photographing properly . Advice is sometimes given to keep your lines on the thin side as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is done with too thick an ink must obviously widen the lines , or if too much pressure is applied . In making designs to be reproduced by photo-mechanical processes , it is usual to draw them considerably larger than they are to be eventually printed . This proceeding , by rendering all the lines finer and closer , adds a general appearance of delicacy and finish to the whole . Experience , however , shows that this added finish of execution does not necessarily mean finish of effect , for where great difference of scale exists between the original and the reproduction , the balance of tone is altered and frequently upset . A warning on this subject appeared in " Harper 's Magazine , " from the pen of Mr. Timothy Cole , one of the ablest living wood engravers . He writes : " The secret of so many recent failures of engravers to do justice to the artist lies in the fact that artists make their drawings too large , and when these are reduced by photography and put on the block very small the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduce the original effect ; and he fails in the endeavor because through the reduction in size the effect has been lost ! " The greys which will PEN-AND-INK DRAWING iii probably compose the chief part of the design , remain substantially the same , while the whites and blacks diminish in importance , so that the usual result when a drawing has been made on a large scale , is , that the reduction is pronounced weak or grey throughout . In practice it is best to make drawings for " photographic reduction " to a scale of about twice the linear measurement required ; in other words , four times the area . If , for instance , the size of the illustrations is to be six inches in height , it is preferable to make the drawings twelve incites ; but be careful in these cases to keep the work very open , and the white and black spaces larger than would look well caption on the scale being used . To work in this way requires some effort and constant self-control , so as not to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists find it on the whole less troublesome to work on a scale nearer to that of the intended reduction . Some artists find that if the linear measurement is one-third larger than the reduction , the latter is found to be sensibly improved in the direction of delicacy without much alteration of general effect . The original of Mr. East 's impressive drawing of the " Dark Island " measured about 13 inches by 9 , and the drawing of " Grig weels " nearly filled a page of note paper . A curious fact has come under my observation while trying upon // my friends the effect of tints composed of parallel lines ; my object being to see how many lines in a given space were required to suggest the appearance of a wash of grey color . I was , of course , prepared to find considerable difference in the clearness of vision of different individuals , all of whom supposed themselves to have exceptionally good sight . The strange point that came under my notice is that to many persons the same tint of parallel lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to present the lines horizontally , from what it did when the lines were perpendicular ; the commonest case being that what appeared a flat wash when the lines were horizontal , would resolve itself into distinct lines when turned , so that the caption lines were perpendicular . In other words , one might put it that perpendicular lines are more easily seen than horizontal ones . When drawing in line for the press , I would give the reader a caution not to go over the light parts of the drawing with either penknife or ink-eraser for the purpose of adding delicacy of effect . The interference with the photographic result is much greater than would naturally be anticipated ; the lines after this treatment , tending to . become broken ( or " rotten " as it is called ) , to an extraordinary degree . There is an easy device for putting a tint over parts of the drawing which will reproduce along with the pen lines . It is obtained by charging a tooth-brush with the ink , holding it face downwards over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle along the // surface so as to produce a shower or spray of small black drops on the part of the drawing exposed . The parts that are to be kept free from the spray are covered . with extra pieces of paper cut to the exact shapes of the spaces to be preserved . It is very difficult to keep the spray even , and it is perhaps most effective when sparingly used to suggest the weather-worn appearance of old stone-work . Besides this so-called " spatter " or " splatter " method , other ingenious means have been tried for getting a tone with little work , such as blacking a piece of coarsely woven material and pressing it on the paper so as to get a rough imprint of the threads ; even thumbprints such as are used for the identification of criminals have been employed . CHAPTER VIII . THE ART OF PYROGRAPHY OR POKER DRAWING . As a first step , the student must purchase a set of tools , and of these , no cheaper and better selection can be obtained than that comprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be found in the box ; the platinum " point " or pencil and the cork handle with swivel joint to prevent tube twisting ; bottles for benzine , india-rubber bellows , and tubing , and several other articles , the use of which shall be explained . Platinum is , as most people know , one of the perfect metals , upon which no single acid has any effect . It is the only metal suitable for the Pyrographic point because it possesses the unique property of taking up and absorbing the benzine gas used to obtain the heat , and , as it were , feeding upon the vapor conveyed to the point by the india rubber bellows . The point supplied with the " Pelican " is of pure platinum , and , although it appears costly , it will outlast two or three cheaper ones in which there is any admixture of other metals . The interior arrangement consists of a small platinum sheath , partially enclosing a fine coiled platinum wire , which , extending some way beyond it , is again enclosed by the outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheath is the " point " from which the heat is conveyed direct in the wood . On the end opposite to the platinum is a small screw with a milled ridge at the base of it . This screw fits into the end of the cork handle , and it must be most emphatically borne in mind , that should the point become too tightly screwed into the socket for the fingers to remove it , the pincers must be applied to the milled ridge only , as their use upon the platinum part ( that metal being somewhat soft ) would undoubtedly result in its destruction . Of course , the point being the only part of the apparatus that comes directly in contact with the wood , it is absolutely necessary that it should be of most convenient I16 // form to suit the artist 's taste , as well as the various effects and touches . For what may be termed general all round service , Fig. 7 is the best . In concluding my remarks upon the " point , " I would impress most forcibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable part of it is composed , is almost as valuable as gold , and should therefore be treated in a manner suitable to its rank among metals . If it get out of order , or , as the expression goes , " refuses to act , " intense heat should be applied by holding it in the lamp for some time and blowing somewhat forcibly with the bellows . If this fail to effect a cure , the safest and best remedy is to send it to the manufacturers , who will repair it at a small cost . Should it become encrusted with potash from working upon a soft wood , in such a manner that heat does not remove it , the extreme point only may be clipped in warm nitric acid , when the corrosion will soon disappear . Care must be taken that the acid is not brought in contact with the brass fitting of the point , on which it would act in a most destructive manner , and the platinum must never , whilst hot , be brought in contact with lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the point be destroyed . In ordinary use the point will last a considerable time without apparent deterioration . The first sign of " over work " being the appearance of small perforations on those parts of its surface that have had most friction upon the wood . It may then be made useful for a certain kind of work , to be hereafter described , but if not required for that purpose , it can be returned to the manufacturers , who will deduct the value of the platinum from the cost of a new one . THE HANDLE . The handle supplied with the " Pelican " outfit is a metal tube about six inches long , with a screw hole at each end , and surrounded by a surface covering of cork . THE BOTTLES . Two of these are supplied ; one will be required to hold the benzine while at work , the other will be found useful for a reserve supply , as , being stoppered , it does not permit unnecessary evaporation , and being made to fit into the box , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparatus . // THE METAL UNION CORK . This is a hollow tubular arrangement which has two smaller tubes branching from it . Round the body of this junction a cork collar is placed , by means of which it fits tightly into the neck of the benzine bottle . This brings us to the INDIA-RUBBER BELLOWS , to which a piece of tubing is fixed at one end ; there is also an odd piece of tubing not at present fastened to anything . If the piece of tubing attached to the bellows be pinched tightly in the thumb and finger , and the smaller ball in the bellows be pressed two or three times , it will be found that the ball surrounded by netting has become inflated with air , which escapes with a puff from the end of the tubing when the pressure of the thumb and finger is removed . It is therefore evident that if the free end of the tube be fastened on to one of the metal forks of the junction and the other fork stopped , the air will find its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . If , however , instead of stopping the other metal fork we fasten an end of the loose piece of tubing securely on to it , the air , which can not find room in the bottle , will find its way down the tube . We next fasten one end of the cork handle on to the free end of the tubing , and the other end screw tightly into the platinum point , thus driving the air right into the point , from which it only escapes , after being burned , from a small hole drilled in the side . It will be easily understood , that if the bottle be three-parts filled with benzine , which is of a most volatile nature , the air driven into the bottle by the bellows mixes with and drives out the gas given off by the benzine . This escapes down the tubing into the point , and by its inflammable properties feeds and keeps up the heat there . THE SPIRIT LAMP . This should be used with alcohol on1 ' , and is necessary for heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once red hot the lamp can be extinguished , and will not be required again , unless from some accident the point is allowed to get cold . p Ito THE AMATEUR ARTIST BENZINE . The ordinary quality , purchased at a paint shop , has been found best for the purpose . Should it not possess sufficient evaporating power , an increased amount of heat can be obtained by putting pieces of cotton wool or lamp wick into the bottle , so that points of it rise mountain-like out of the fluid , this will give a larger evaporating surface . It is well to remind the reader that the benzine is highly inflammable , and therefore must not be tampered with . Under ordinary circumstances there is absolutely no danger in the use of it , but upsetting the bottle near a fire or lamp might result in a serious accident . If by any accident the benzine should be tipped over , immediately raise the point above its level , as should the benzine run into the tube and reach the platinum point , it would corrode it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a subject to which the really serious student of Pyrography can not devote too much attention , if he contemplates a piece of work that is likely to be of some value when completed . The reader will see the truth of this when he remembers that it is absolutely the ground upon which his work will appear . In Pyrographic work , if the wood be unsuitable for the purpose , every stroke will be a failure , and if it be the right kind of wood but unsound , the artists ' labor will be so much waste of time . It is therefore absolutely necessary that the wood be sound , free from knots and well seasoned , particularly the latter , for if it be at all green , the heat of the point will cause its contraction on one side , thus giving the picture a boat-shaped appearance , with the chance of its splitting down the centre if an attempt be made to straighten it . If a board should begin to curve from unequal drying , the best remedy is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will keep it flat , and in course of time it will dry all through . The woods most generally useful for Pyrography are : basswood , oak , elm , ash , holly , lime , sycamore , chestnut , cedar , aspen poplar , tulip , and the wood from Assam tea chests . American white wood presents a very good surface for burning but it is so eccentric in its
