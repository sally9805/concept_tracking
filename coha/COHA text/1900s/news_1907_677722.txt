txt The sudden change of torte of the German press regarding the French and Spanish expedition into Morocco , to avenge the killing of Europeans , mostly Frenchmen , can have escaped no attentive reader . At first the German press generally grumbled . Why warships and " troops , that press asked , when the mandate of Algeciras had empowered France and Spain to police Morocco in the interest of " Christendom " ? Now this jealousy has disappeared . The German press seems to acquiesce in the French occupation of the coast of Morocco " for the pacification thereof . " It seems even to acquiesce in the extension of this occupation into a ? rotectorate , provided only German commercial privileges are preserved , the same privileges in behalf of which the German Emperor harangued the German merchants of Tangier in that speech which has continually been talked about but never reported . Why this change ? Obviously , to most observers , it illustrates the peculiar docility of the German press . The German official press has received the 1 official " word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harmony arises from the discord of the preliminary " tuning up . " But why the word of order ? Why the authoritative wave of the baton ? It is not cynical to suggest that somebody In authority has seen a great light , that the fanatical courage and death-defiance of the Moors have shown that the real policing of ) Morocco is a task far beyond the imagination of France when she entered upon it , that it is a work of a long time , of ? much treasure , and of many lives . For that time France will be the weaker for any European conflict by the withdrawal of so many men and of so much money . Remember Algeria . The conquest of Algeria took full fifteen years , cost scores of thousands of French lives and uncounted and uncountable out/ays of French money . Even yet the conquest of Algeria is not com1plete . A European may go back into the Eastern " hinterland " for hundreds of miles without running any " extra hazardous " risk . But not for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marches with Morocco . True , the Moroccans have not yet developed an ABD EL DER . They have not yet developed al Mandi to preach the Holy War . ? They have developed only a predatory Raik Utz . But all the more formidable does the French task appears of pacifying Morocco when " the mere unguided fanaticism of its Mohammedans , cornbined with the opportunities for loot and for anticipating the joys of the Mohammedan paradise , have been potent to hold a strong French force on the defensive at Casablanca and to prevent the French commander from even considering an incursion into the interior , whence the cloud of Moorish cavalry has emerged and whither it has returned . It is not a matter of months , it seems , of this French conquest of Algeria , but a matter of years . It is not a matter of brigades or of divisions , but of army corps . A hundred thousand French troops were operating at once in Algeria before Algeria was reduced even to its present - condition of docility . France could afford those troops then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can she afford them now for a diversion from her force available for self-defense ? The question is one that is likely to excite reflections in Paris . Apparently it has already excited reflection in Berlin .
