We are inclined to disagree with those who assert that the instinct to travel is the lowest mental incentive that urges mankind to seek strange lands and new sights . Moreover , we believe that this migratory or nomadic instinct , this wanderlust , has a distinct literary value . How tasteless is a book of travels that recounts with statistical dryness the dull catalogue of common things found in a venturesome journey ' Darwin , among the scientists , in his " Voyage of the Beagle , " Henry M. Stanley among the great explorers , and Mrs. Bishop among those who travel for descriptive material , had this instinct and managed to impart a goodly share of it to their books . Nor is this instinct confined to the records of actual travel . Nowhere can it be found to better advantage than in " Robinson Crusoe " and " Gulliver 's Travels . " On the other hand , we miss this wander-spirit in many otherwise commendable books . Longfellow 's " Outre Mer , " Hawthorne 's note-books of travel , Holmes 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Traits , " ? to limit our list to books by Americans , ? are lacking in this zest of the human desire to go a-wandering . Certainly so good a traveller and writer as the author of " Travels with a Donkey " and " An Inland Voyage " would not make the spirit of travel a minor motive in mankind or a minimum literary force in books of travel . Nowhere is this spirit more apparent than in books dealing with the attempts to find the two poles of the earth . The great sums of money , the sacrifice of life , the rivalry of the nations , and the undying energy exhibited , are sufficient evidence that mankind is prompted to seek the unknown in order to satisfy a powerful human passion . Indomitable courage , the will to do , and the endurance of heart-breaking hardships , characterize those men who would discover a point of zero in the earth 's latitude and longitude . Such is the spirit that infuses the vivid and instructive book entitled " The Siege of the South Pole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | who admits that he has never been within two thousand miles of the Antarctic Circle , has had the rare fortune " to possess the personal friendship of all , or almost all , the living explorers and promoters of exploration in the Antarctic Regions . " He can , consequently , give a personal touch to his summary of Antarctic travel . His volume is very complete in its descriptions of all the efforts that have been made to reach the South Pole . We find a good summary of the earlier voyages which fell short of the Circle ; then we read at great length of the noteworthy voyages from the time of Cook , in 1772 , down to our own time , ? to the voyages of Scott , Drygalski , Nordenskjold , Bruce , and Charcot . Nearly all of these explorers left personal records of their trips ; but many of their accounts , especially those between the voyages of the " Resolution " in 1772 and the " Challenger " in 1874 , are now out of print or are difficult to consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his voyage and discoveries , made in 181921 , and hitherto accessible only in the Russian language and in a German translation made in 1902 . For these reasons , Dr. Mill 's book is a very acceptable contribution to the literature of exploration at the South Pole . That " the siege of the South Pole has been a spasmodic operation , proceeding by magnificent efforts separated by long intervals of inertness and inattention , " and that each fresh expedition had to begin at the beginning , acquiring its own experience by repeating the errors of its predecessors , is only too evident in reading this volume . Dr. Mill , however , is not pessimistic about the ultimate discovery of the South Pole . Soon , probably within the first quarter of the present century , some explorer , the author thinks , will wipe " the reproach of Terra Incognita from the surface of our little globe . " Our space forbids our making even the briefest summary of a book that is intended to be a compact handbook . We do not hesitate to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antarctic exploration what General A. W. Greely 's " Handbook of Arctic Discoveries " does for the history of exploration at the North Pole , and that it does it equally well . After the somewhat heavy but wholesome fare of Dr. Mill 's volume , one relishes the slighter and more superficial quality of Mr. Richard Arthur 's " Ten Thousand Miles in a Yacht . " Ten men and a lad left New York in November , 1904 , in the palatial yacht " Virginia , " captained by Mr. E. C. Benedict ; they visited Bermuda , sailed across the tropical sapphire seas , along the palm-fringed Carribean islandcoasts , " touching at Dominica , Martinique , Santa Lucia , Barbadoes , and thence passed up the Amazon for a thousand miles , past Para and Santarem to Mangos , where they remained a week , thence voyaging back along the coasts of South America to Jamaica and Havana , and finally , on January 30 , 1905 , they dropped anchor in East River in " Little Old New York . " We have chosen the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Many optimistic people look forward to the time when the Amazon country will be thickly populated , and prosperous plantations will occupy the river front on each side for thousands of miles . I am aware that it is generally as rash a thing to foretell what will not happen as to predict what will happen ; but I can not see in the future the thick population and the prosperous plantations that have been prophesied . There certainly will be development on the higher lands ; but on the lower Amazon , for some hundreds of miles , there seems little prospect of reclaiming the alluvial flats from the grip of the river . A great deal of this land is submerged in the high-river season , and if the forest were stripped from it the river would eat it up like so much salt . " Here is a fish story : " It was the evening of January 5 , about 10 o'clock . The yacht was gliding through the sea at nearly fifteen knots an hour and rolling about twenty-five degrees . One of the stewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dreaming ? doubtless of the girl he left behind . Suddenly he was awakened by something swishing through the open window , over his right shoulder close to his face . Before he could open his eyes he heard the flop of something weighty on the floor beneath the dining-room table , and then , to his amazement , he saw the gleaming back of a good-sized , tail-flapping all-alive-o fish . A brother steward was immediately summoned , and then nearly the whole crew , and the fish was duly measured and weighed . The official report made him 2 feet 3 inches long and gave him 31 pounds avoirdupois . He certainly made a famous leap to get out of the sea into the dining room . " One of the best features of the volume is the introduction , written by Mr. William M. Ivins . Mr. Ivins , who has business interests in Brazil , and has made other trips to that country , is evidently well informed about the land and the people ? so well , indeed , that some readers may wish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benares has always had a strangely fascinating interest for travellers in India . The reason is apparent : there is seen , in all its degradation and splendor , the microcosm of Indian religious life . To know all the ramifications of this life , with its three hundred million  | deities , is probably beyond the psychology of the ordinary western mind . Hence one appreciates a calm , dispassionate , well-ordered , and studious unravelling of the labyrinth of Hindu life and religion . Principal E. B. Havell , of the Government School of Art at Calcutta , has done this in a masterly manner in his book entitled ? Benares , the Sacred City . " We read in his book about the Vedic times , the great Hindu epics , the latest discoveries at Sarnath the birthplace of Buddhism , the rise of modern Hinduism , and , at more length , of the worship of Shiva , the presiding deity of Benares . We voyage with him along the Ganges river , seeing the wonderful rites and ceremonies of the bathers , visiting the ghats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and making the pilgrimages to the various holy places . No part of his interesting book is more graphic and picturesque than the following account of one of the Hindu festivals : The most beautiful of all the latter is the Diwali , or Feast of Lamps , in honor of Lakshmi , the goddess of Fortune . In the evening , when the short Eastern gloaming is merging into night , numbers of girls and young women , graceful as Greek nymphs in their manycoloured saris , come silently down to the ghats , bearing little earthen lamps , which they light and carefully set afloat . Then with eager faces they watch them carried away on the rippling surface of the water , still shimmering with opalescent tints from the last rays of the afterglow . For if a tiny wavelet should upset the frail craft , or if the light should flicker and go out , it bodes misfortune in the coming year . But if the light burns strong and well , till the lamp is borne far away by the current in midstream , happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters . By the time the twilight fades there are hundreds of twinkling lights dotted over the river , as if holy Ganga had borrowed the stars from heaven , whence she came , to adorn her earthly robes . " Principal Havell , in closing his book , says : " No doubt Hinduism will continue to be modified by the inflow of Western ideas . There can be no greater mistake than to consider Hinduism as so many immutable customs and forms of ritual and belief , which may be uprooted , but can not be trained or adapted . " The volume is well illustrated with appropriate pictures ? pictures that assist the text . Mr. G. F. Abbott 's book entitled " Through India with the Prince " covers the whole country and touches on every imaginable topic that India offers to a writer . As special correspondent for the Calcutta " Statesman , " a journal of which he has for some years been editor , the author accompanied their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales on their recent Indian tour . The royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peshawar ; thence , turning east and south , they visited Amritsar , Delphi , Agra , Lucknow , and Calcutta , whence they sailed to Burma , where they stopped at Rangoon and Mandalay , thence back to Madras , and then , turning north again , they visited Hyderabad , Benares , Nepal , and finally , cutting across northern India , after a stop at Simla , they departed from the country at Karachi . Though we give the route of the royal party , we do not , wish to imply that Mr. Abbott 's book is mainly concerned with the . doings and receptions that were everywhere held in honor of the visit of the royal pair . On the contrary , it gives but little more than a decent amount of attention to the many durbars of the native princes , and still less attention to the Prince and Princess of Wales . As the royal party did not remain long at any one place , we need not wonder that the author 's descriptions are at times rather blase and thin . The Taj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me think of Euclid , or of a toy-shop . The Taj seems to me to need a glass case . " The volume records a traveller 's impressions , marked by a certain quality of mixed cynicism , acerbity , and egotism . Such sentences as the following are not infrequent in the book : " They tigers never attack human beings so long as they can obtain a respectable animal " ; and , " after all , death is only one of the minor tragedies of life . " The want of descriptive power and the too pronounced personal note are the two blemishes that detract from the main value of the book , which is found in the writer 's comments and observations on the political status of India . On this subject he is sound and earnest , although his views are probably not in accord with government views and reports . Mr. Abbott asserts that the British Government in India has failed to earn the love of the people , and that , if the present government is to hold , it must make concessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyderabad , he wrote : " The only condition of success ? the condition on the observance of which depends the very permanence of the British Empire in India ? is sincere cooperation between the Englishman and the native ; and as the native becomes more and more educated he is entitled to a greater and yet greater share in the government of his own country . The example of a native state like Baroda brilliantly proves that the talent for self-government is not a monopoly of the West . The moral qualities and the material means necessary for the work are quite as plentiful in the East . " But , says the author , self-government for India , as well as many other Western ideas , is yet very distant . The photographic reproductions  | in the book are the best we have seen of Indian sights for some time . " It is a curious fact that , notwithstanding our boasted nineteenth-century progress in methods , discovery , and invention , up to the coming of the motor-car man had made absolutely no progress since the dawn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These words , challenging us to a debate , introduce us to the spirited and enthusiastic account of a confirmed automobilist , who , with two equally enthusiastic and jolly companions , made a motor-car trip through England , thence across to Paris by way of Rouen , to Lucerne by way of Basle , Switzerland , to Geneva , and then back to Paris through Aix-les-Bains . Mr. Winthrop E. Scarritt , a former President of the Automobile Club of America , tells the story of this trip very well in his little volume entitled " Three Men in a Motor Car , " although he adds nothing to our stock of information about the places he visited . The intrinsic value of the book lies in the specific information that he gives to other automobilists as to how to " do " Europe in a motor-car . We learn , for example , that there is an automobile bureau in Paris , in London , and in Stuttgardt , where an automobilist may have every want supplied and every petty foreign interference removed . Much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consideration of the future automobile , automobile legislation , good roads , automobile contests , and other like subjects dear to the automobilist . After reading Mr. Scarritt 's volume , one can readily agree with those charming writers on the automobile , C. N. and A. M. Williamson , who write the introduction to this book , when they say , " It is the deliberate opinion of all who have tried it , that life can offer few more vivid joys than a tour in a motor-car through a beautiful country . " Although Mr. George Milton Fowles , the author of the book entitled " Down in Porto Rico , " disclaims to write in a spirit of adverse criticism , the shadow is more pronounced than the light in his summary of observations based on a year 's residence in the island . His account , moreover , is marked by a strong religious bias . He believes that the ultimate regeneration of the Porto Ricans must come through the Protestant religion . There is , to be sure , some truth in this last statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so evident . We believe that the author makes a far more important observation when he writes : " If the people learn to read American literature and come to know our ideals of national life , if they are able to converse in an intelligent manner with the American officials and citizens who reside in Porto Rico , it will not be long until this people shall be thoroughly American . " For this reason the author believes that English instead of Spanish should be the basic language used in the schools . Among other changes that are needed , or are being made , the author cites the separation of Church and State , the " rapidly rising moral tone of family life , " the increasing trade with the United States , the change of sentiment toward manual labor , and the establishment of the rights of American citizenship . For those who have read but little about Porto Rico , Mr. Fowles 's book will give much detailed information concerning the mental , physical , and spiritual characteristics of the Porto Ricans , and about the educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The book also contains a sufficient amount of historical background to help to explain many of the existing conditions . Thoreau once boasted of the treasures he found on the barren sands of a desolate creek . A similar spirit pervades and animates Mr. J. A. Harvie-Brown 's two-volume work bearing the title " Travels of a Naturalist in Europe . " The region of the author 's trips lies in Norway , and in extreme northeastern Russia at Archangel , near the Dvina Delta , and at Petchora , near the Arctic Circle . An unusual feature of the book is the fact that it recounts the travels of the author made as long ago as 1871 , 1872 , and 1875 . The publication of the author 's journal at this late date is but scantily justified by " the very antiquity of the relation . " The real purpose and value of the book , however , lie in the observations of the author and his companions on bird and animal life , ? observations that are minutely correct and scientific , and will be of interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there are minor observations and reflections on the natives and their modes of living . One appendix is devoted to the Samoyedes of extreme northern Russia . An excerpt will illustrate the spirit and purpose of the book . The naturalists were anxious to find specimens and eggs of the Little Stint and the Grey Plover . One day , so says the author : " Seebohm had grand success , returning shortly after me , and with a triumphant thump laid on the table , first a Grey plover , then a Snow Bunting ; . . lastly , and most triumphantly ? hurrah ! ? five Little Stints , long looked for , found at last . " Such a spirit of discovery of small things has  | almost a kinship with Columbus 's first sight of land , Sverdrup 's view of a new land , or Balboa 's long-wished-for vision of the Pacific . All the discoveries and observations made by the author have been tabulated and arranged in order . The volumes are well printed , and well illustrated with colored plates necessary to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
