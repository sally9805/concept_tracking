txt Riot and bloodshed marked the progress of the teamsters ' strike to-day . There were numerous fights between the police and the strikers and their sympathizers . Street-car traffic was stopped while the fighting went on . Fists , stones , and clubs were brought into requisition by the strikers , and the police used their batons and the butt ends of revolvers freely . The fighting began on the West Side shortly after noon , and in different parts of the city continued practically all of the afternoon . The most serious trouble of the day occurred in Crosby Street , in the district which is known in police circles as " Little Hell . " A. detachment of policemen under the command of Lieut . Collins was escorting a number of wagons loaded with meat to the distributing stations down town . A large crowd followed the wagons , shouting and jeering , and now and then sending a stone over the heads of the officers in the direction of the men on the meat wagons . The line of wagons escorted by the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull across the street just in the proper place to prevent the meat wagons from making any progress . The police would order the man away and in a few minutes the performance would be repeated , much to the delight of the immense crowd that was following on . Finally one teamster refused to pull his team out of the way of the meat wagons , and the police placed him under arrest . Then the fight commenced . In an instant a shower of stones , mud , and sticks fell around and upon the officers , bruising some of them badly . Lieut . Collins ordered the march of the meat wagons to be stopped , and at once charged the crowd . The sight of a policeman on the aggressive is nothing new to the inhabitants of " Little Hell , " and the crowd refused to budge when the police came on . A large number of women came up to the aid of the strikers and were the fiercest fighters of the lot . One officer was knocked down with a brick and his companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a few minutes the street was filled with men with bleeding heads . The mob was led by a large man , who came from the gashouse near Crosby Street , and who continually called to his followers to " Kill the coppers first and hang the scabs afterward . " Finally a big policeman got to the man from the gashouse , and when it was over the leader was carried off by his friends with his head and face covered with blood . The police made no attempt to.arrest him , for they had their hands full with the hundreds of men atsd women who crowded around them and fought viciously with anything they could lay their hands upon . The crowd increased so rapidly that Lieut . Collins soon saw that his men would be overpowered unless he took vigorous action at once . He ordered the men to fall back slowly toward the wagons , and the crowd , seeing in this action a token of victory , pressed on with shouts , and the volleys of stones came more thickly . The police fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagons and then , at Lieut . Collins 's order , they drew their revolvers and charged the crowd once more . This time the fight was more desperate than before , and it was over in much less time . The police struck down numbers of men , and used their clubs and revolver butts with energy , and in three minutes the crowd was broken and in full flight . Forming his men around the wagons once more , Lieut . Collins started on his march . As soon as the police started away , the mob formed again , and although at a respectful distance , they kept after the wagons until they had reached the barns at Halsted and rivision Streets . In this fight about a dozen of the officers were badly bruised , and nearly all of them had torn clothing . Many more of the mob were badly used up , but as they were all taken off by their friends , it is impossible to guess at the number . By the time the barns were reached the anger of ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to cross Halsted Street , but in less than a minute a blockade had been formed which it took two hours to release . The trouble at this point began when a Halsted Street electric car stopped directly on the crossing . The car was filled with passengers on their way home from work . CITIZENS DEFY POLICE . It was a peculiar coincidence that just as the packing house wagons approached the crossing the current was cut off . It was said that the trolley wire had been cut . A Police Sergeant approached the car and ordered the motorman to proceed . " Do n't you do it , " shouted the passengers . " We 'll stay here all night . Do n't move a step . " The motorman informed the Police Sergeant that the current was turned off and showed this to be a fact by turning the controller . Hundreds of factory hands were being dismissed from the neighboring shops . Scores of heavily loaded wagons drove up , and in five minutes Halsted Street was packed and jammed with teams and wagons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose in such a way as to form a complete blockade . The crowd shouted and jeered at the police when they attempted to induco the teamsters to move on . The police attempted a display of force , only to arouse the crowd again . Stones were thrown at the police , and the rioters were clubbed and dragged into the patrol wagons . Finally , after pushing and fighting for a long time , the police managed to get the wagons to the barns and the doors were closed . To-night another serious fight took place at Twelfth and State Streets . Meat was being removed from the packing house plants by two ' retail firms , Froehlin &; Heppe and Rettinger &; Hoffherr . In the afternoon the wagons had been loaded , and then a request was made for a police escort to accompany the loads . The owners of the butchers ' shops were with the loads to encourage their men and offer such assistance as they could . A crowd awaited the wagons . The drivers were hooted and jeered , but they kept their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant . Shortly after 6 o'clock in the evening the wagons started . Three policemen were detailed to follow the men and prevent trouble . The crowd held back from open violence until the wagons reached the Twelfth Street viaduct . The wagons first passed the viaduct on State Street , but as the crowd enlarged and the threats were increased it was deemed advisable to return the wagons to the packing house plants . The crowd had rapidly increased , and the wagons could not be driven through the dense masses . The three policemen tried to frighten the crowd by a display of weapons , but while they were attempting to guard two . wagons each the strikers and their sympathizers removed the nuts on the axles and cut the traces . The strikers climbed into the wagons and threw the meat into the street . The three policemen and the eight drivers , aided by the owners of the shops , fought the mob , but they were hang rapidly overpowered . Police Sergeant Mooney was passing on a State Street car . He pushed his way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagons where the fighting was the thickest . As he did so he was seen by Edward Allen . colored . Allen , it is said , was six months ago sent to the Bridewell by Sergt. Mooney . The colored man was wielding a razor , and he threw himself at the Police Sergeant . The two grappled and fought in the mud until the colored man , it is said , had cut the Sergeant twice over the head with the razor . Allen was pulled away by another policeman . Mooney was taken to the Samaritan Hospital . His injuries are not fatal . POLICEMEN FIGHT CROWD . Policeman Weber had forced his way to a patrol box and sent in a riot call . Patrol wagons from the Central , Harrison Street , Twenty-second Street , Cottage Grove Avenue , and Thirty-fifth Street Police Stations were sent to the scene .

First the meat owners rescued the meat from the muddy street and then , under heavy guard , drove to their places of business . The six prisoners were placed in a patrol wagon and started for the Harrison Street station . A crowd followed the wagon and threatened the policemen . At Taylor Street the wagon stopped . The horses could not be driven through the crowd . As the wagon stopped and the policemen ordered back the crowd , another fight started . The horses were taken from the patrol wagon and the six prisoners were for a time released . The officers fought hard and the crowd was forced back . The prisoners were again loaded into the wagon and the horses attached . With the crowd shouting and threatening , the patrol wagon was driven to the police station without a stop and the six men were locked in cells .
