 |p1156  IN THE INDEPENDENT of September 26th , 1907 , appeared an article written by the Hon. Walter Clark , of North Carolina , under the head of " Is the Supreme Court Constitutional ? " It is not my intention to take issue with the distinguished jurist as to his views , but there are some misstatements of historical facts which I think should be corrected in order to prevent any misapprehensions as to those facts . The distinguished gentleman in his article says : " In the great convention of 1787 , when the Constitution of the United States was framed , a proposition was made that the Judges should pass upon the constitutionality of the acts of Congress . That was defeated June 5th , receiving the vote of only two of the States . It was renewed June 6th and again July 21st , and for the fourth time it was urged on the 15th of August , but altho it had the powerful support of Mr. Madison and Mr. James Wilson , at no time did it receive the votes of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four States , New Jersey , Rhode Island , Virginia and North Carolina , had expressed an opinion that they could hold the acts of a Legislature unconstitutional . " It is true , as alleged , that the courts of the four States named and also of New York had , prior to the convention of 1787 , assumed the right to declare acts of the Legislature which were in conflict with the constitutions of the respective States void , but it is not true that any proposition giving to the courts or judges the power to pass upon the constitutionality of the acts of Congress was ever defeated , as no such proposition had ever been submitted to that body . The proposition which was before the convention on June 4th and was defeated was the eighth proposition of Mr. Randolph 's resolution for a constitution , which had been proposed on May 29th . This proposition was for a Council of Revision with power to veto all acts of Congress . This council was to be composed of the Executive and any convenient number of the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By referring to Madison 's journal of that convention , Vol . V , Elliott 's Debates , p. 151 , it will be found that the proposition before the convention was the eighth resolution of Mr. Randolph , which was as follows : " Resolved , That the Executive , and a convenient number of the national judiciary , ought to compose a council of revision , with authority to examine every act of the National Legislature , before it shall operate , and every act of a particular Legislature before a negative thereon shall be final ; and that the dissent of the said council.shall amount to a rejection , unless the act of the National Legislature be again passed , or that of a particular . Legislature be again negatived by  - -  -  of the members of each branch . " Vol . V , Elliott 's Debates , p. 128 . On June 4th , p. 151 , the following is found : " The first clause of the eighth resolution , relating to a council of revision , was next taken into consideration . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , as they will have a sufficient check against encroachments on their own department by their exposition of the laws . which involved a power of deciding on their constitutionality . In some States the Judges had actually set aside laws as being against the Constitution . This was done , too ,  |p1157  with general approbation . It was quite foreign from the nature of their office to make them judges of the policy of public measures . He moves to postpone the clause , in order to propose , ' that the National Executive shall have a right to negative any legislative act which shall not be afterwards passed by  - -  -  parts of each branch of the National Legislature . ' " Mr. King seconded the motion , observing that the Judges ought to be able to expound the law as it should come before them , free from the bias of having participated in its formation . " This resolution of Mr. Randolph 's was defeated , evidently upon the ground as stated by Mr. Gerry : " as the judiciary will have a sufficient check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws , which involved a power of deciding on their constitutionality . " The proceedings on July 21st referred to by Judge Clark practically related to the same resolution as found in V Elliott 's Debates , p. 344 . The proposition was made by Mr. Wilson , who moved as an amendment to the tenth resolution " that the supreme national judiciary should be associated with the executive in the revisionary power . " This was negatived . The proceedings on August 15th , which Judge Clark claims were an effort to vest in the judiciary the power to declare acts unconstitutional , were merely another effort to make the judiciary a part of the revisionary council , authorizing them , with the President , to veto bills enacted by Congress , and not an effort to authorize them to declare acts unconstitutional . The resolution , which was introduced by Mr. Madison and seconded by Mr. Wilson , was as follows : " Every bill which shall have passed the two Houses shall , before it becomes a law , he severally presented to the President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the revision of each . If , upon such revision , they shall approve of it , they shall respectively signify their approbation by signing it ; but if . upon such revision , it shall appear improper to either , or both , to be passed into law , it shall be returned , with the objection against it , to that House in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on . their journal , and proceed to reconsider the bill ; but if , after such reconsideration , two thirds of that House , when either the President or a majority of the Judges shall object , or three-fourths , where both shall object , shall agree to pass it , it shall , together with the objections , be sent to the other House , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and , if approved by two-thirds , or three-fourths of the other House , as the case may be , it shall become a law . " This resolution had the approval of Mr. Mercer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Judge Clark , but he did not say that the courts did not have the power to declare an act of the Legislature unconstitutional , but he " disapproved of the doctrine that the judges , as expositors of the Constitution , should have authority to declare a law void . He thought laws ought to be well and cautiously made , and then to be uncontrollable . " This motion of Mr. Madison 's was rejected , but not any motion that the judiciary should be granted the power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional . In view of the fact that all the courts which had ever past upon that question had , prior to the meeting of the convention , assumed that power , a fact which must have been well known to the members of the convention , among whom were some of the greatest jurists of the time , if the framers of the Constitution thought that power should be denied to them , why did not some member offer a resolution to that effect ? There was no necessity to grant them a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition as stated by Judge Clark was made . It would be folly to have a written Constitution , which is declared to be the supreme law of the land , " limiting the powers of the legislative department , if that department could enact laws regardless of the Constitution . If there is a conflict , certainly the supreme law of the land must prevail over every other . A very valuable article on this subject , written by William M. Meigs , of Pennsylvania , will be found in 19 American Law Review , p. 175.
