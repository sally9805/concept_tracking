" made some unusual observations on the negro question and said : " I think the Republican Party in the North has come to the conclusion that the . Fifteenth Amendment was a hideous mistake . There is a growing sentiment among the Republicans In the North to let the Democrats in the South deal with the race problem . We ought to let our . Southern brothers , who have to live with the negro . solve the negro question . " The law has become commercialised . It has woefully deteriorated In many respects . Commercialism has perverted many of the legal Ideas and purposes of the old schooL Instead of looking upon the law as a. profession , incidentally furnishing a livelihood for the lawyer , our young men to-day are going into law because they think they can make more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole legal principle . If t here Is any class I detest it is the ? ambulance chaser . ' It is the motto of every decent member of the legal profession th a the client must hunt the lawyer , not the lawyer the client . " But while there has been a decline in some features of the law It Is no worse than other profesaiens . What is the literature of to-day and who are literary giants ? Where will you find a great novelist in this country ? Name , if you can , a truly great poet ? Where are our great orators ? Are there any Websters or Choates in our profession any longer ? " You will find the same baneful effects of commercialism in the Church : Larger congregations and more beautiful buildings do n't take the place of real religion . " What we need is an ethical revival . We need higher standards in all our professional and personal activities . The law . In particular , must be uncommercialized .
