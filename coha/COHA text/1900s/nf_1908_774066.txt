txt rzo THOMAS ALVA EDISON the new light called at the laboratory and were admitted , afterwards being eagerly buttonholed by the reporters as they made their reappearance ; but they had been placed under injunctions of secrecy and would not talk . Edison , sympathizing with the " newspaper boys , " as he called them , sent out a message saying that " he had encountered several difficulties which he had overcome by inventions already patented , but he had made other discoveries more important than all in the way of making the electric light available , and to disclose them to the public would endanger the success of the entire enterprise . Some delay would occur before application could be made for patents , as they related to materials which were not easily obtained in this country . " It was on October 21 , 1879 , that Edison discovered the carbonized cotton filament , and in January of the following year letters patent were granted him for his new and , improved electric lamp . The specification in this interesting document , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Be it known that I , Thomas Alva Edison , of Menlo Park , New Jersey , United States of America , have invented an improvement in electric lamps and in the method of manufacturing the same of which the following is a specification : " The object of this invention is to produce electric lamps giving light by incandescence , which lamps shall have high resistance , so as to allow of the practical subdivision of the electric light . The invention consists in a light-giving body of carbon wire coiled or arranged in such a manner as to offer great resistance to the passage of the electric current and , at the same time , present but a slight surface from which radiation can take place . The invention further consists in THE ELECTRIC LIGHT iii placing such burner of great resistance in a nearly perfect vacuum to prevent oxidation and injury to the conductor by the atmosphere . The current so conducted into the vacuum bulb through platina wires scaled into the glass . The invention further consists in the method of manufacturing carbon conductors of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' by incandescence . " Heretofore , light by incandescence has been obtained from rods of carbon of r to 4 ohms resistance and placed in closed vessels , in which the atmospheric air has been replaced by gases that do not combine chemically . The leading wires have always been large , so that their resistance shall be many times less than the burner , and , in general , the attempts of previous workers have been to reduce the resistance of the carbon rod . The disadvantages of following this practice are that a lamp having but r to 4 ohms resistance can not be worked in great numbers in multiple arc without the employment of main conductors of enormous dimensions ; that owing to the low resistance of the lamp , the leading wires must be of large dimensions and good conductors , and a glass globe can not be kept tight at the place where the wires pass in and are cemented ; hence the carbon is consumed , because there must be always a perfect vacuum to render the carbon stable , especially when such carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The use of gas in the receiver at the atmospheric pressure , although not attacking the carbon , serves to destroy it in time by air-washing or the attrition produced by the rapid passage of the gas over the slightly coherent , highly heated surface of the carbon . I have reversed this practice . I have discovered that even a cotton thread properly carbonized and placed // in a sealed glass bulb exhausted to one millionth of an atmosphere , offers from one hundred to five hundred ohms resistance to the passage of the current , and that it is absolutely stable at very high temperatures ; that if the thread be coiled as a spiral and carbonized , or if any fibrous vegetable substance which will have a carbon residue after heating in a closed chamber be so coiled , as much as 2000 ohms resistance can be obtained without presenting a radiating surface greater than three-sixteenths of an inch . I have carbonized and used cotton and linen thread , wood-splints , papers coiled in various ways , also lampblack , plumbago , and carbon in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various lengths and diameters . " It is generally believed that the above was the first statement made in writing by Edison in reference to his incandescent electric light . Previous patents , however , had been granted to him covering a new generator , a modification of the Sprengel quicksilverpump for the production of a vacuum , and other parts of the process . Since then he has taken out one hundred and sixty-nine patents on electric lights . Having solved the difficulty of a suitable filament , he made a number of lamps which were strung along a wire and suspended from the trees in Menlo Park . They attracted world-wide attention , and the fact that they remained burning night and day for more than a week appeared marvellous to the thousands who journeyed to Menlo Park to view the wonderful lamps . " The lamps , " wrote one of the visitors at the time , " are about four inches long , small and delicate , and comely enough for use in any apartment . They can be removed from a chandelier as readily as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The current is turned on and off by the simple means of // pressing a button . The lamp is simplicity itself in form and construction , and can be made for a very small sum . A few of the lamps which have been in use longest appear a little duller than the others , but this defect the inventor says will disappear as soon as he has carried out a few changes in the construction of the globe , which he contemplates doing at an early date . " During the early days of January a general illumination of Menlo Park took place for the special edification of the New York Board of Aldermen , who went out to the laboratory at Edison 's invitation on a special train . The inventor so arranged matters that the visitors arrived after dark , and the effect of the hundreds of brilliant incandescent lamps glowing among the leafless trees was very remarkable . The lamps were strung along two big wires , and the way in which one could be extinguished or lit without interfering with the others appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors on this memorable occasion was Hiram Maxim . And during all this time that Edison had been perfecting the incandescent lamp his mind had been busy with another great idea ? that of a central station from which consumers might obtain their electric light in the same way that they drew their gas . The initial difficulties of such an undertaking were gigantic . It must be remembered that electric lighting was an absolutely new art , and outside the Edison laboratory there was no one who knew what it was all about . There were no factories to manufacture the apparatus , no skilled artisans to carry out the installing of an electric light system ; no one , in fact , with the exception of Edison 's immediate associates , who could be trusted even to put a carbon filament in an exhausted // globe . But Edison 's mind had long been made up . His ambition was to see a central station built somewhere in New York , and he never rested until his ambition was realized . The story of how this first central station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole history of electric lighting . Many years ago Edison related some of his experiences in connection with this work in the Electrical Review ? the first and , I believe , last occasion on which he referred to the subject at any length ? and to the editor of this magazine I tender my thanks for permission to reproduce here some of the inventor 's remarks : " I had the central station idea in my mind all the time that I was pursuing my investigations in electric lighting . I got an insurance map of New York , in which every elevator shaft and boiler and house-top and fire-wall was set down and studied it carefully . Then I laid out a district and figured out an idea of the central station to feed that part of the town from just south of Wall Street up to Canal and over from Broadway to the East River . I worked on a system , and soon knew where every hatchway and bulkhead door in the district I had marked was and what every man paid for his gas . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hired a man to start in every day about two o'clock and walk around through the district noting the number of gas lights burning in the various premises ; then at three o'clock he went around again and made more notes , and at four o'clock and up to every other hour to two or three o'clock in the morning . In that way it was easy enough to figure out the gas consumption of every tenant and of the whole district ; other men took other sections . " After various other preliminaries we were fairly committed to the lighting project and started in to // build the central station . You can not imagine how hard it was . There was nothing that we could buy or that anybody else could make for us . We built the thing with our hands , as it were . At Menlo Park we started a lamp factory . Krusei was set to work making the tubes over in Washington Street , and we hired a kind of a second-class machine shop in Goerck Street and there started out making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Side where he made gas fixtures , and he went into making sockets and fixtures for us and did well with them . We started with our own money and credit ? mostly credit . But we soon got the money put up for the station by starting the New York Edison Illuminating Company . " I planned out the station and found where it ought to go , but we could not get real estate where it was wanted . It cost us $150,000 for two old buildings down in Pearl Street where we finally settled . We had very little room and we wanted a big output . There was nothing else for it but to get high-speed engines , and ? there were no high-speed engines in those days . I had conceived the idea of a directcoupled machine , and wanted to hitch the dynamo direct to the engine without belting . I could not see why , if a locomotive could run on that speed , a 150 horse-power engine could not be made to run 350 turns a minute . The engine builders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and said , Impossible ! ' I did n't think so . I found C. H. Porter , and I said to him , Mr. Porter , I want a 150 horse-power engine to run 700 revolutions per minute . ' He hummed and hawed a little while , and then agreed to build it ? if I could pay for it ! I believe he charged me $4200 for it . He got it finished and sent it out to the Park . // " We set the machine up in the old shop , and we had some idea of what might happen . So we tied a chain around the throttle valve and ran it out through a window into the wood shed , where we stood to work it . Now the old shop stood on one of those New jersey shale hills , and every time we opened up the engine and she got to about 300 revolutions the whole hill shook under her . We shut her off and rebalanced and tried again , and after a good deal of trouble we finally did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her run ! Why , every time the connecting rod went up she tried to lift that whole hill with her ! After we got through with this business we tamed her down to 350 revolutions ( which was all I wanted ) , and then everybody said , Why , how beautifully it runs , and how practicable such an engine is ! ' We closed a bill for six engines , and I went to work in Goerck Street to build the dynamos on to them . Of course , we built them by guesswork . I guessed at 1 io volts ? and I did n't guess enough . So we put extra pole-pieces on them , and in that way managed to raise the voltage to what I wanted . " While all this was going on in the shop we had dug ditches and laid mains all around the district . I used to sleep nights on piles of pipes in the station , and I saw every box poured and every connection made on the whole job . There was nobody else who could superintend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to put on an engine and turn over one of the machines to see how things were . My heart was in my mouth at first , but everything worked all right , and we had more than 500 ohms insulation resistance . Then we started another engine and threw them in parallel . Of all the circuses since Adam was born we had the worst then . One engine // would stop and the other would run up to about a thousand revolutions , and then they would see-saw . " What was the matter ? Why , it was these Porter governors ! When the circus commenced the men who were standing around ran out precipitately , and some of them kept running for a block or two . I grabbed the throttle of one engine and E. H. Johnson , who was the only one present to keep his wits , caught hold of the other and we shut them off . Of course I discovered then that what had happened was that one set was running the other one as a motor . I then put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought this would certainly cure the trouble , but it did n't . The torsion of the shaft was so great that one governor still managed to get ahead of the others . Then I went to Goerck Street and got a piece of shafting and a tube in which it fitted . I twisted the shaft one way and the tube the other as far as I could and pinned them together . In this way , by straining the whole outfit up to its elastic limit in opposite directions , the torsion was practically eliminated , and after that the governors ran together all right . " About that time I got hold of Gardiner C. Sims , and he undertook to build an engine to run at 350 revolutions and give 175 horse-power . He went back to Providence and set to work and brought the engine back with him . It worked , but only a few minutes , when it busted . That man sat around that shop and slept in it for three weeks until he got his engine right and made it work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period I gave orders for the works to run night and day until we got enough engines , and when all was ready we started the engine . The date was September 4 , 1882 ? a Saturday night . That was // when we first turned the current on to the mains for regular light distribution , and it stayed on for eight years with only one insignificant stoppage . One of these engines that Sims built ran twenty-four hours a day for 365 days before it was stopped . " In those days we used the old chemical meters , and these gave us a lot of trouble , for , as they contained two jars of a liquid solution , there was always a danger of freezing in the cold weather . So I set to work to negative this difficulty and succeeded , as I thought , by putting an incandescent lamp in each meter with a thermostat strip , which would make a contact through the lamp when the temperature fell to 40 degrees . That idea , simple as it was , caused us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the telephone in our office began to ring every five minutes and people would say ? " Our meter 's red hot . Is that all right ? ' " Then some one else would call up and say ? " Our meter 's on fire inside , and we poured water on it . Did that hurt it ? ' " As to voltmeters , we did n't have any . We used lamps . And I had n't much use for mathematicians either , for I soon found that I could guess a good deal closer than they could figure , so I went on guessing . We used to hang up a shingle nail , tie it on a string alongside one of the feeders , and used that for a heavy current ammeter . It worked all right . When the nail came close to the feeder we screwed up the rheostat a little , and in this way kept the lamps looking about right . " I invented the fuse wire about the time of the aldermen 's visit to Menlo Park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , and I had thought out the scheme of putting some fine copper THE ELECTRIC LIGHT rzq wire in as fuses in various places . And when the aldermen came one fellow in the party who had a little piece of heavy wire in his hand managed to shortcircuit the mains with his wire . He was very much surprised because only three lamps went out . The real reason that led me to think of the fuse wire was that we were not very flush of dynamos in those days . I had burned out two or three , and I saw that something was needed to prevent that happening again . After my experience with my short-circuiting friend , I had fuses put in all over . " To the late Luther Stieringer I am indebted for the following brief description of the various methods adopted by Edison for registering the quantity of current supplied to consumers in those days : " Many experiments were made with all sorts of mechanism , motors , clockwork , electro-magnets , springs , heat , electrolysis , and electro-deposition . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer perfectly . It consists of a small glass cell , containing a solution in which two zinc plates are immersed . A certain proportion of the current entering the building is diverted through this combination , and an electro-plating action is set up in the cell , zinc being deposited on one plate from the other . According to a well-known scientific law , a current of certain strength will deposit just so much zinc in a given time , no more and no less . Therefore , it is easy to see that if the plates are periodically weighed , the amount of current supplied between the times of weighing can be calculated to a nicety . " Mr. Edison has also invented various other instruments for measuring electric-light currents , such as a weighing voltmeter , in which the current acts on coils of wire at one end of the beam , the other end being // balanced by a cup filled with shot . The deflection of the pointer indicates the pressure of the current traversing the coil . In another instrument he causes the pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sheet of paper , revolved by clockwork ; and in a third , which he has styled the sonorous voltameter , ' the action of the current makes itself known by a series of small explosions in a glass cell . Two platinum wires are immersed in water in the cell , and the current passing between them decomposes the water , causing small bubbles to rise to the surface and explode ; the cell is closed over , with the exception of an aperture provided with a funnel to magnify the sound . " It is interesting at this date , when the thirtieth anniversary of the invention of the incandescent lamp is in sight , to look back and note the buildings which were first illuminated by electric light . It is claimed that the first office building to adopt the incandescent lamp was that of the New York Herald , where a complete plant was installed , and when that enterprising paper sent out the sailing vessel Jeanette to find the North Pole , one of her chief novelties was a complete installation of the Edison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so it is more than possible that some of Edison 's first lamps are still reposing beneath the waters of those icy regions . The first church lighted by electricity is generally supposed to have been the City Temple , London , while the first theatre was the Bijou , Boston , which was lighted by an Edison isolated plant , December 12 , 1882 . There were 65o lamps used , and the first attraction given with the new illumination was , very appropriately , Gilbert and Sullivan 's fairy opera " Iolanthe . " The proscenium arch was surrounded THE ELECTRIC LIGHT 12T by 192 lamps ; 140 were placed in the borders , and 6o in the chandelier of the auditorium , making a total of 392 lamps ? the balance being placed in different parts of the building . No other method of lighting was provided , and there were no footlights . The first hotel to be lighted by electricity was the Blue Mountain House , in the Adirondacks , where an Edison plant was started in 1881 . There were 125 lamps , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also at this hotel that the first electric lamp was placed in an elevator car ? July 12 , 1882 . The Blue Mountain House is situated at an elevation of 3500 feet above the sea , and was , at the time of the electric-light installation , forty miles from the railroad . The machinery was taken in pieces on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain . The boilers were fired with wood , as the commercial transportation of coal was a physical impossibility . For a six hours ' run of the electric plant , one-quarter of a cord of wood was required at a cost of 25 cents per cord . Regulation of the dynamo was effected by a rheostat in the office , about roo feet from the centre of distribution . The first electrolier was wired and placed in service some time during 1880 , at the residence of Mr. Francis R. Upton , at Menlo Park , near Edison 's laboratory . Great care was taken to distinguish the polarity of each conductor , the positive wires being of red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were from the first placed in an inverted posi tion , which is now so familiar but was then so novel . This electrolier was shown at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904 . The first private residence to be lighted by Edison lamps was that of J. Hood Wright , New York , while the first steam vessel to employ the same illu122 THOMAS ALVA EDISON minant was the Columbia , running between San Francisco and Portland , Oregon . The country which probably lagged longest behind in a general adoption of the electric light was England , due , no doubt , to the fact that in 188o Parliament passed a law whereby it was enacted that at the expiration of twenty years electric-light plants were to be bought by the Government . The result can be imagined . Private enterprise was strangled , and gas as an illuminant remained triumphant . Eight years later , however , the law was repealed , and soon the electric light began to glow in every village and hamlet throughout the country . Over the electric light there has been more litigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he himself says : " I fought for the lamp for fourteen years , and when I finally won my rights there were but three years of the allotted seventeen left for my patent to live . Now it has become the property of anybody and everybody . " One writer , in a letter addressed to the press , endeavored to show that the incandescent light was used in the thirteenth century , and to prove his point quoted the following from a work entitled " Sorcery and Magic , " published in 1852 : " During the thirteenth century , for profit of the common people , Virgilius , on a great mighty marble pillar , did make a bridge that came to the palace . The palace and bridge stood in the middle of Rome , and upon this pillar made he a lamp of glass that always burned without going out , and nobody might put it out ; and this lamp lightened over all the city of Rome from the one corner to the other ; and there was not so little a street but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did stand ; and upon the // walls of the palace made he a metal man that held in his hand a metal bow that pointed over and upon the lamp to shoot it out ; but always burned the lamp and gave light over all Rome . " And upon a time went the burgesses ' daughters to play in the palace , and they beheld the metal man , and one of them asked in sport why he shot not ; and then she came to the man and with her hand touched the bow , and then the bolt flew out and break the lamp that Virgilius made . And it was wonderful that the maid went not out of her mind for the great fear she had , and also the other burgesses ' daughters that were in her company , of the great stroke that it gave when it hit the lamp . And this forsaid lamp was abyding after the death of Virgilius by the space of three hundred years or more . " According to this original correspondent , the lamp of Virgilius was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper that published his curious letter plaintively inquired , " What will the Patent Office do about it ? " The Patent Office , however , took no action in the matter , but confined its attention to those living claimants who labored wider the delusion that they had invented the incandescent electric-light system , and who cropped up as suddenly as mushrooms in June . While Edison was still experimenting at Menlo Park , and soon after he had given the exhibition of his first electric lamps , considerable excitement was caused by some humorous newspaper man spreading the report that what every one thought was the evening star was really an electric lamp which Edison had sent up attached to an invisible balloon . It seems almost incredible , but by thousands of people the story was believed , and for many nights within a radius of a hundred miles faces were turned upward to gaze on the J24 THOMAS ALVA EDISON mysterious light . After a time people in other states declared that they also could see the wonderful sight . The newspapers were inundated with letters asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what Edison 's object was in sending it up such a height . When the papers assured the public that the wonderful light was nothing but the evening star , at least half the people did n't believe it , and for years afterwards the subject would be revived from time to time by the publication of letters in the local press . As late as 1895 the light was referred to as the " Edison Star , " and the inventor often had a quiet chuckle over the idea that he should have attempted the illumination of the firmament . Edison himself received many letters on the subject , but he never replied to them , hoping that the absurd story would die a natural death  --  which it did after reaching years of discretion . No other industry has grown to such mighty proportions as that of the incandescent electric light . Twenty years after its invention the investment in electric-lighting plants in the United States alone amounted to the enormous sum of $750,000,000 . " This extraordinary achievement , " said the statistician who made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition of a longestablished industry ? that of gas illumination . It made its way against bitter opposition , against corrupt councils , and the difficulties and failures consequent upon over-capitalization , to where it is now ? one of the solid , certain industries of the world . Beyond any question the most marvellous development of this or any other century in the field of applied science may be seen in the electric-lighting industry . There is nothing comparable to it in the whole history of civilization . The average layman who sees the streets of the // modern city and its stores made light as day has little conception of the amazing growth of the industry that has reached the highways of human progress with millions upon millions of incandescent bulbs . " CHAPTER IX EXPERIMENTS WITH PLATINUM WIRE EDISON has not often lectured in public , and the majority of those lectures which he has delivered have not , unfortunately , been preserved . One of his most valuable addresses , however , he still possesses , and as it shows some of the inexhaustible energy he displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his invention of the incandescent light , besides describing many curious phenomena arising from the heating of metal in vacuo by means of the electric current , we reproduce it here with the inventor 's permission . It was delivered before a New York audience on September 2 , 7879 , a short time prior to his discovery of the bamboo filament . " In the course of my experiments on electric lighting , " read Mr. F. R. Upton from the writer 's exquisite manuscript ? for Edison himself was too busy to deliver the lecture ? " I have developed some striking phenomena arising from the heating of metal by flames and by electric current , especially wires of platinum and platinum alloyed with iridium . These experiments are still in progress . The first fact observed was that platinum lost weight when heated in a flame of hydrogen , that the metal colored the flame green , and that these two results continued until the whole of the platinum in contact with the flame had disappeared . Platinum wire i of an inch in diameter , and weighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hydrogen flame . It lost weight at the rate of a fraction less than i milligramme per hour as long as it was suspended in the flame . When a platinum wire is stretched between two clamping-posts , and arranged to pass through a hydrogen flame , it is colored a light green , but when the temperature of the wire is raised above that of the flame , by passing a current through it , the flame is colored a deep green . " To ascertain the diminution in the weight of a platinum wire when heated by the electric current , I placed between two clamping-posts a wire i o as of an inch in diameter , and weighing 266 milligrammes . This wire , after it was brought to incandescence for about twenty minutes by the current , lost z milligramme . The same wire was then raised to incandescence ; for about twenty minutes it gave a loss of 3 milligrammes . Afterward it was kept incandescent for one hour and ten minutes , at which time it weighed 258 milligrammes , a total loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept moderately incandescent for nine hours , after which it weighed 201 milligrammes , showing a total loss of 42 milligrammes . " A platinum wire i o 0 0 of an inch in diameter was wound in the form of a spiral a of an inch in diameter and 2 an inch in length . The two ends of the spiral were secured to clamping-posts , and the whole apparatus was covered with a glass shade 4 inches in diameter and 3 inches high . Upon bringing the spiral to incandescence for twenty minutes that part of the globe in line with the sides of the spiral became slightly darkened ; in five hours the deposit became so thick that the incandescent spiral could not be seen through the deposit . This film , which was most perfect , con128 THOMAS ALVA EDISON sisted of platinum , and I have no doubt but that large plates of glass might be coated economically by placing them on each side of a large sheet of platinum kept incandescent by the electric current . " This loss in weight , together with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the use of metallic wires for giving light by incandescence , but this was easily surmounted after the cause was ascertained . I coated the wire forming the spiral with oxide of magnesium by dusting upon it finely powdered acetate of magnesium ; while incandescent the salt was decomposed by the heat , and there remained a strongly adherent coating of the oxide . This spiral so coated was covered with a glass shade and brought to incandescence for several minutes , but instead of a deposit of platinum upon the glass there was a deposit of the oxide of magnesia . " From this and other experiments I became convinced that this effect was due to the washing action of the air upon the spiral ; that the loss of weight in , and the coloration of , the hydrogen flame was also due to the wearing away of the surface of the platina by the attrition produced by the impact of the stream of gases upon the highly incandescent surface , and not to volatilization , as commonly understood . And I venture to say , though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be volatilized in high vacua by the heat derived from incandescent platinum ; in effect , what may be produced will be due to the washing action of the residual air . " After the experiments last described I placed a spiral of platinum in the receiver of a common air pump , and arranged it in such a manner that the current could pass through it while the receiver was exhausted . At a pressure of two millimetres the spiral // was kept at incandescence for two hours before the deposit was sufficient to become visible . In another experiment at a higher exhaustion it required five hours before a deposit became visible . " In a sealed glass bulb , exhausted by a Sprengel pump to a point where a quarter of an inch spark from an induction coil would not pass between points one millimetre apart , was placed a spiral , the connecting wires passing through the glass . The spiral was kept at the most dazzling incandescence for hours without the slightest deposit becoming visible . " I will now describe other and far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of platinum wire , 101oa of an inch in diameter , be held in the flame of a Bunsen burner , at some part it will f use and a piece of the wire will be bent at an angle by the action of the globule of melted platinum ; in some cases there are several globules formed simultaneously , and the wire assumes a zigzag shape . With a wire in o of an inch in diameter this effect does not take place , as the temperature can not be raised to equal that of a smaller wire owing to the increased radiating surface and mass . After heating , if the wire be examined under the microscope , that part of the surface which has been incandescent will be found covered with innumerable cracks . If the wire be placed between clamping-posts and heated to incandescence for twenty minutes by the passage of an electric current , cracks will be so enlarged as to be seen with the naked eye , the wire under the microscope presents a shrunken appearance and is full of deep cracks . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will so increase that the wire will fall to pieces . " This disintegration has been noticed in platina long subject to the action of a flame by Professor John // W. Draper . The failure of the process of lighting invented by the French chemist Tessic du Motay , who raised sheets of platinum to incandescence by introducing them into a hydrogen flame , was due to the rapid disintegration of the metal . I have ascertained the cause of this phenomenon , and have succeeded in eliminating that which produces it , and in doing so have produced a metal in a state hitherto unknown , and which is absolutely stable at a temperature where nearly all substances melt or are consumed ; a metal which , although originally soft and pliable , becomes as homogeneous as glass and rigid as steel . When wound in the form of a spiral it is as springy and elastic when at the most dazzling incandescence as when cold , and can not be annealed by any process now commonly known . " For the cause of this shrinking and cracking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air in the mechanical and physical pores of the platinum and the contraction upon the escape of the air . Platinum , as sold in commerce , may be compared to sandstone in which the whole is made up of a great number of particles , with many air spaces . The sandstone upon melting becomes homogeneous , and no air spaces exist . With platinum or any metal the air spaces may be eliminated and the metal made homogeneous by a very simple process . This process I will now describe . " I have made a large number of platinum spirals all of the same size and from the same quality of wire ; each spiral presented to the air a radiating surface of three-sixteenths of an inch ; five of these were brought by the electric current up to the melting-point , the light was measured by a photometer , and the average light was equal to four standard candles for each spiral just // at the melting-point . One of the same kind of spirals was placed in the receiver of an air-pump and the air exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the wire slightly warming it for the purpose of assisting the passage of the air from the pores of the metal into the vacuum . The temperature of the wire was gradually augmented at intervals of ten minutes until it became red . The object of slowly increasing the temperature was to allow the air to pass out gradually and not explosively . " Afterward the current was increased at intervals of fifteen minutes . Before each increase in the current the wire was allowed to cool , and the contraction and expansion at these high temperatures caused the wire to weld together at the point previously containing the air . In one hour and forty minutes this spiral had reached such a temperature without melting that it was giving a light of twenty-five standard candles , whereas it would undoubtedly have melted before it gave a light of five candles had it not been put through the above process . Several more spirals were afterward tried with the same result . One spiral , which had been brought to these high temperatures more slowly , gave a light equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiral gave nearly the same light , although it required some current to keep it at the same temperature . " Upon examination of these spirals , which had passed through the vacuum process , by the aid of a microscope , no cracks were visible ; the wire had become as white as silver , and had a polish which could not be given it by any other means . The wire had a less diameter than before treatment , and it was exceedingly difficult to melt in the oxyhydrogen flame . As compared with untreated platinum it was found that // it was as hard as the steel wire used in pianos , and that it could not be annealed at any temperature . " My experiments with many metals treated by this process have proved to my satisfaction , and I have no hesitation in stating , that what is known as annealing of metals to make them soft and pliable is nothing more than the cracking of the metal . In every case where a hard drawn wire had been annealed a powerful microscope revealed myriads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I have just spoken , I have , by the aid of Sprengel mercury pumps , produced higher exhaustions , and have by consuming five hours in excluding the air from the wire and intermitting the current a great number of times , succeeded in obtaining a light of eight standard candles from a spiral of wire with a total radiating surface of 2 of an inch , or a surface about equal to a grain of buckwheat . With spirals of this small size , each having passed through the process , the average amount of light given out before melting is less than one standard candle . Thus I am enabled , by the increased capacity of platinum , to withstand the high temperatures , to employ small radiating surfaces , and thus reduce the energy required for candle-light . " I can now obtain eight separate jets , each giving out absolutely steady light , and each equal to sixteen standard candles or a total of 128 candles by the expenditure of 30,000 foot-pounds of energy , or less than one horse-power . " As a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded the air from them in the manner stated . Common iron wire may be made to give a light greater than platinum not heated . The iron becomes as hard as steel and just as elastic . Nickel is far more refractory than iron . Steel wire used in // pianos becomes decarbonized , but remains hard and assumes the color of silver . Aluminium melts only at a white heat . " In conclusion it may be interesting to state that the melting-point of many oxides is dependent upon the manner of applying the heat . For instance , pure oxide of zerconium does not fuse in the flame of the oxyhydrogen blow-pipe , while it melts like wax and conducts electricity when on an incandescent platinum spiral which is at a far lower temperature ; on the other hand , oxide of aluminium easily melts in the oxyhydrogen flame , while it only vitrifies on the platinum spiral . " CHAPTER X THE PHONOGRAPH THE phonograph was the result of pure reason based upon a very happy inspiration . In his early work with automatic telegraphs operating at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips impressed with dashes and dots thereon which were moved rapidly beneath a stylus to vibrate it . It was observed that this stylus in vibrating produced audible sounds . A small thing such as this would pass unnoticed by the ordinary observer as of no interest , but to a mind that is not only intensely alert but highly analytical it was regarded as a curious phenomenon . At this time Edison was actively working on his telephone experiments , so that his attention was largely absorbed by matters connected with acoustics . Simply as a matter of inspiration the idea of a talking machine occurred to him , and , remembering his experiments with the automatic telegraph transmitter , he concluded that , if the undulations on the strip could be given the proper form and arrangement , the diaphragm could be vibrated so as to reproduce any desired sounds . The next step was to form the proper undulations in the strip , and the idea was then suggested to Edison 's mind that these undulations could be produced by sounds themselves , which could then be reproduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced . Obviously , the change from a 134 // strip of material capable of being impressed by soundwaves to a cylinder of such material on which the sound-waves could be impressed in a spiral line was a refinement of the original conception which simply involved mechanical considerations . It is , therefore , rather an interesting fact that in the development of the phonograph the reproduction of the sounds preceded the original production of the record . Ten years after inventing the phonograph Edison wrote an article on the subject for the pages of the North American Review . From this interesting paper we quote the following paragraphs : " In the phonograph , " he writes , " we find an illustration of the truth that human speech is governed by the laws of number , harmony , and rhythm . And by these laws we are now able to register all sorts of sounds and all articulating utterances ? even to the lightest shades and variations of the voice ? in lines or dots which are an absolute equivalent for the emission of sound by the lips ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lines and dots to give forth again the sound of the voice , of music , and all other sounds recorded by them , whether audible or inaudible . For it is a very extraordinary fact that , while the deepest tone that our ears are capable of recognizing is one containing sixteen vibrations a second , the phonograph will record ten or less , and can then raise the pitch until we hear a reproduction of them . Similarly , vibrations above the highest rate audible to the ear can be recorded by the phonograph and then reproduced by lowering the pitch until we actually hear the record of these inaudible pulsations . " To make the idea of the recording of sound more clear , let me remark one or two points . We have all been struck by the precision with which even the // faintest sea-waves impress upon the surface of a beach the fine , sinuous line which is formed by the rippling edge of their advance . Almost as familiar is the fact that grains of sand sprinkled on a smooth surface of glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various lines and curves according to the vibrations of the melody played on the piano keys . These things indicate how easily the particles of solid matter may receive an imparted motion , or take an impression , from delicate liquid waves , air-waves , or waves of sound . Yet , well known though these phenomena were , they apparently never suggested until within a few years that the sound-waves set going by a human voice might be so directed as to trace an impression upon some solid substance with a nicety equal to that of the tide recording its flow upon a sand beach . " My own discovery that this could be done came to me almost accidentally while I was busy with experiments having a different object in view . I was engaged upon a machine intended to repeat Morse characters which were recorded on paper by indentations that transferred their message to another circuit automatically when passed under a tracing-point connected with a circuit-closing apparatus . In manipulating this machine I found that when the cylinder carrying the indented paper was turned with great swiftness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a musical , rhythmic sound resembling that of human talk heard indistinctly . This led me to try fitting a diaphragm to the machine , which would receive the vibrations or sound-waves made by my voice when I talked to it , and register these vibrations upon an impressible material placed on the cylinder . The material selected for immediate use was paraffined paper , and the results obtained were excellent . The indentaTHE // tions on the cylinder , when rapidly revolved , caused a repetition of the original vibrations to reach the ear through a recorder , just as if the machine itself were speaking . I saw at once that the problem of registering human speech so that it could be repeated by mechanical means as often as might be desired was solved . " John Krusei , the man who made the first phonograph , died in 1899 , but his voice is still preserved among hundreds of other records in the store closets of the Orange laboratory . Edison has often affirmed that Krusei was the cleverest mechanic who ever worked for him , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention of the phonograph was brought to so speedy and successful an issue . He was wonderfully quick at grasping the principles of any new discovery , and was an adept at making models which would perform all the duties expected of them . When Edison had conceived the phonograph he called Krusei to him , showed him a rough sketch of the proposed machine , and asked him to build a model as quickly as he could . In those days Edison 's model makers worked by piece , and it was customary to mark the price on each model . In this instance the cost agreed upon was eight dollars . Krusei was asked how long it would take him to complete the model , and he replied that he could n't tell , but he promised that he would n't rest until it was finished . This was in the Menlo Park days , when Edison was looked upon as the sleepless wonder . He was accustomed to his chief assistants ' working with him for two and three days at a stretch without rest , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with as little repose as the inventor himself , and would become so absorbed in his work that fatigue was unfelt and time forgotten . The principles of the // phonograph he absorbed with lightning rapidity , but it took him thirty hours to make the model ? thirty hours without rest and very little food . At the end of that time he brought to Edison the historic machine which is now preserved in the South Kensington Museum . It was a large , clumsy affair ; tinfoil was used as the material on which the indentations were to be made , and the cylinder was revolved by hand . If Edison was in any way excited on receiving the first model of his invention for recording human speech he did not show it , and those who were with him on that memorable occasion affirm that he regarded it at the time more in the light of a queer toy than that of a machine which would create any great sensation . Among those who were present when Krusei brought in his model was Carman , the foreman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe what he had been told , bet Edison a box of cigars that the thing would n't work . The inventor , with much good-humor , accepted the wager , and then with a smile , born of absolute faith in his deductions , slowly turned the handle of the machine and spoke into the receiver the first verse of " Mary had a little Lamb . " Then the cylinder was returned to the starting-point , and faint , but distinct , came back the words of that juvenile classic faithfully repeated in Edison 's familiar tones . Those present were awed rather than astonished , and the tension was not broken until Carman , in accents of pretended disappointment , and with a look of assumed disgust , exclaimed , " Well , I guess I 've lost . " The first patent on the phonograph was filed in the United States , December 24 , 1877 , and was granted February 19 , 1878 , No. 200,521 . Prior to this , however , in an application filed in Great Britain on July 30 , 1877 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phonograph , but also an apparatus embodying his original conception of an embossed strip . Under these circumstances , perhaps , it is not unreasonable that Great Britain should now possess Krusei 's original model , though its loss is one which America will doubtless deplore in years to come . The phonograph has been described as the simplest machine ever invented ? there is absolutely no complicated mechanism of any kind in its make-up ? yet it is difficult to believe this when confronted by a description subsequently given in a court of law when " infringements " began to come in with that customary regularity attendant upon every new and successful invention . A document was filed describing the " talking machine " in a way which made the inventor smile . " The phonograph , " it declared , " is a machine for recording and reproducing sound , and from a commercial standpoint consists of two articles , one of which is commonly known to the public as the phonograph ' and the other as the record . ' The phonograph , ' as designated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a revolving shaft to which is attached a tapering mandrel , connected by intermediate gearing , with which is a frame arrangement to move longitudinally with the shaft as the shaft revolves ; in this frame may be placed either of two apparatuses which are called respectively a recorder ' and a reproducer . ' Each of these consists of a glass diaphragm to which by intermediate mechanism is attached either a cuttingpoint or a reproducing-point ; the mechanism having attached to it a cutting-point is called a recorder , ' and the one having attached to it a reproducing-point is called the reproducer . ' " The record referred to consists of a tubular tablet zqo THOMAS ALVA EDISON or record blank of metallic soap , cylindrical on its exterior , and having a tapering bore suitable to be placed in the tapering mandrel . When this tablet or blank is placed on the mandrel , and the recorder is put in operative relation with it , and sound-waves are directed against the diaphragm of the recorder , and the mandrel is revolving , the sound-waves are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elevations in the bottom of the groove corresponding to the sound-waves . The tablet with this record of sound upon it becomes a record as the word is used by the public . When the sounds so recorded are to be reproduced the same operation is repeated , except that a reproducer is substituted for a recorder . " On reading this lucid and interesting description , Edison said it made his head swim , and that he never before realized what a wonderful and remarkable invention the phonograph really was . The document deserved to be placed in the archives of phonographic curiosities . On the model of the first phonograph about fifty other machines were built , but these were almost all destroyed in subsequent experiments . Early in his work of perfecting his invention Edison discovered that tinfoil was practically worthless as a recorder  - -  it did not retain the impression accurately , and after being used once or twice was useless . So he turned his attention to discovering a new and better composition on which to record sound-waves . Wax immediately suggested itself , but after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product was not what he was looking for . He studied works on the subject of animal and vegetable oils , and obtained samples of almost every known fat in the Old and New Worlds . Then he set half-a-dozen men to THE PHONOGRAPH 14I work melting , blending , and mixing a hundred different varieties , and finally obtained a combination of waxes which seemed to answer his purpose . But the stuff was costly , and in order to economize it he made the cylinders of paper and covered them with the wax to a depth of about an eighth of an inch . The result was good records , but the cylinders were very fragile , and considerable care had to be taken in handling them . Edison was not satisfied . He saw with the eye of a practical man that the phonograph to be popular must be furnished with records capable of withstanding a certain amount of free usage , and this convinced him that a composition cylinder was the thing he wanted , so he discarded wax and tried stearate of soda . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edison record as we know it to-day is made of a combination of ingredients which much resembles soap . Stearin , it may be mentioned , is , according to Webster , " one of the proximate principles of animal fat , as lard , tallow , and the like . The various kinds of animal fat commonly consist of two substances , principally stearin and elain , of which the former is solid and the latter liquid . In particular instances several other different and distinct proximate principles are found in animal fats . " Readers may be glad to remember this when next listening to an Edison record ! A few months after the invention of the phonograph Edison was asked to forecast its usefulness , and it may not be without interest to recall here what he said thirty years ago . He believed that the greatest use for the phonograph would be found in the office , where it could take all the correspondence and repeat it for the benefit of the letter writer . Authors , he thought , would use the phonograph instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from records . // In the law courts witnesses would be compelled to speak their evidence into a " talking machine , " which would also record the sayings of judge and counsel . For public speakers the phonograph would be valuable in enabling them to be heard simultaneously in a hundred different towns . It would take the place of readers in blind asylums and hospitals , and as an elocutionary teacher , or as a primary teacher for children , it would , he declared , be invaluable . Continuing his prophecies , Edison said : " The phonograph will undoubtedly be largely devoted to music ? either vocal or instrumental ? and may possibly take the place of the teacher . It will sing the child to sleep , tell us what o'clock it is , summon us to dinner , and warn the lover when it is time to vacate the front porch . As a family record it will be precious , for it will preserve the sayings of those dear to us , and even receive the last messages of the dying . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh , cry , and sing , and imitation dogs that bark , cats that meow , lions that roar , and roosters that crow . It will preserve the voices of our great men , and enable future generations to listen to speeches by a Lincoln or a Gladstone . Lastly , the phonograph will perfect the telephone and revolutionize present systems of telegraphy . " How much of this forecast has been realized is well known to the reader ? certainly sufficient to stamp Edison as a very good prophet . Up to the present , however , the combination of phonograph and telephone has not proved a success ; but there is time yet , and the inventor still hopes to realize this prophecy made by him in 1878 . A few years ago the combination was tried in San Francisco , and a New York man on his return from a Western trip volunteered some // information regarding the experiment of applying an automatic phonograph to a telephone switchboard to do the work of an operator . " The result , " he said , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been heart-breaking to some of their subscribers . This phonograph was so arranged that when a subscriber called up a number that was busy the phonograph answered , Busy now . Call up later . ' This was the invariable reply whenever a busy number was called over , and it was given in a monotonous tone of voice . " I admired the cleverness of the application until the manager said to me , You know some of our subscribers are very profane , and perhaps you would like to hear their opinions . Here is Captain Blank , who has been calling a busy number now for five minutes . Listen to him . ' Captain B. 's wire was swung on to a receiver , which I put to my ear . I never heard anything like it . You blankety blank , blank idiot , ' he was saying , ca n't you say anything else but " Busy now . Call up later " ? There you go again , you blamed idiotic chump . I am going up to the Central Office and kill you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is one of the drawbacks to this invention . It excites profane men unduly , and it might lead to violence . ' I heard the opinion of several other San Franciscans who called busy numbers and received over and over again this monotonous reply , and I think the invention is open to serious objection . " Two writers at least have predicted the phonograph . In 1839 an unidentified author ? generally believed to have been the poet Hood ? wrote : " In this country of inventions , when a self-acting drawing-paper has been discovered for copying invisible objects , who knows but that a future Niepce , or Daguerre , or Her144 THOMAS ALVA EDISON schel or Fox Talbot might find out some sort of Boswellish writing-paper to repeat whatever it hears ? " The second writer to predict the phonograph was a woman ? Miss Jean Ingelow ? and she came out with her prediction only five years before it was realized . In a fairy story written by her in 1872 , and entitled " Nineteen Hundred and Seventy-two , " wherein she sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such explicit reference to the phonograph that it appears to be something more than a coincidence . Miss Ingelow certainly possessed the idea of such a machine , and had she been born with the inventive genius of Edison she might , perhaps , have forestalled him . The particular paragraph which has reference to the modern " talking machine " is here quoted : " He began to describe what was evidently some great invention in acoustics , which , he said ( confusing his century with mine ) , you are going to find out very shortly . You know something of the beginnings of photography ? ' I replied that I did . Photography , ' he remarked , presents a visible image ; can not you imagine something analogous to it which might present an audible image ? The difference is really that the whole of a photograph is always present to the eye , but the acoustigraph only in successive portions . The song was sung and the symphony played at first and it recorded them , and gave them out in one simultaneous , horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science soon managed , as it were , to sketch the image ? and now we can elongate it as much as we please . ' That is very queer ! ' I exclaimed . Do you mean to tell me these notes and those voices are only the ghosts of sounds ? ' Not in any other sense , ' he answered , than you might call a photograph a ghost of s=ght. ' // " The phonograph , " relates a writer in an old number of the New York Herald , " came to the Edison laboratory and the first baby to the Edison home about the same time , and when the baby was old enough to say Goo-goo ' and pull the great inventor 's hair in a most disrespectful manner , the phonograph was near enough perfection to capture the baby talk for preservation among the family archives . So Mr. Edison filled up several rolls with these pretty articulations and laid them carefully away . " But this was not sufficient . The most picturesque thing about the baby 's utterances was its crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure . How it would entertain him in his old age , he thought , to start the phonograph a-going and hear again the baby wails of his firstborn ! So one afternoon Mr. Edison tore himself away from his work , and climbed the big hill leading to his house . He went in a great hurry , for he is a man who grudges every working moment from his labors . A workman followed at his heels , carrying the only phonograph that at that time had been sufficiently completed to accomplish really good results . " Reaching home and the nursery , Mr. Edison started the phonograph and brought the baby in front of it . But the baby did n't cry . Mr. Edison tumbled the youngster about , and rumpled its hair and did all sorts of things , but still the baby did n't cry . Then the inventor made dreadful faces , but the baby thought they were very funny , and crowed lustily . So back to the laboratory went Mr. Edison in a very unpleasant frame of mind , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . The phonograph was also taken back . " But he did n't give it up . The next afternoon he // went home again , and the phonograph with him . But if the baby was good-natured the day before , this time it was absolutely cherubic . There was nothing at all that its father could do that did n't make the baby laugh . Even the phonograph with its tiny whirring wheels the baby thought was meant for its special entertainment , and gurgled joyously . So back to work the inventor went again with a temper positively ruffled . The next day and the next he tried it , but all to no purpose . The baby would not cry even when waked suddenly from sleep . " But to baffle Edison is only to inflame his determination , which , as has been remarked before , is one of the secrets of his success . So at length , after much thought , he made a mighty resolve . It took a vast amount of determination on his part to screw his courage to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , and one morning , when he knew his wife was down town , he went quietly home with the phonograph and stole into the nursery , where the baby greeted him with its customary glee . " Starting the machine , Mr. Edison ordered the nurse to leave the room . Then he took the baby on his knee and bared its chubby little leg . He took the tender flesh between his thumb and finger , clenched his teeth , shut his eyes tight , and made ready to ? yes , actually to pinch the baby 's leg . But just at the fateful moment the nurse peeped through the door , And , perceiving the horrid plot , flounced in and rescued the baby in the nick of time . Mr. Edison breathed a mighty sigh of relief as he gathered up the phonograph and went back to the laboratory . He then gave up the project of phonographing the baby 's crying . " But not long afterwards be accomplished his purTHE // pose in spite of everything , and quite unexpectedly , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take notice ' its mother took it down to the laboratory one sunny day , and when the big machinery was started a-roaring , the baby screwed up its face , opened its mouth , and emitted a series of woful screams that made Mr. Edison leap to his feet . Stop the machinery and start the phonograph , ' he shouted , and the record of his baby 's crying was there and then accomplished . " Of all Edison 's inventions the phonograph probably caused the greatest sensation . There was something so inexpressibly weird in the idea of capturing speech and preserving it for centuries to come , that the inventor was regarded more than ever as a " Wizard . " Every one wanted to hear the phonograph , and as soon as it was possible to make the machines a number were despatched to all parts of the world . In England and on the Continent it was the talk of the hour , and monopolized the attention of crowned heads and commoners alike , to the exclusion of everything else . Edison 's name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France at that time he would probably have been hailed more rapturously than even Napoleon when he escaped from Elba . But though he would not at that time risk visiting the Old World himself ( he hates to be lionized ) , he sent several of his best machines , one of which he despatched by his faithful co-worker , A. T. E. Wangemann , the manager of the Phonograph Experimental Department , to Berlin . This was in 1888 , and the young Emperor of Germany had expressed the liveliest interest in the invention . As soon as it became known that Mr. Edison 's representative was in Berlin , together with one of the " talking machines , " there was intense excitement . // The newspapers were full of more or less exaggerated accounts of what the wonderful instrument would do , though few in that city had yet heard it . It was to be shown first of all to Emperor William . At his Majesty 's special request , Mr. Wangemann took the phonograph one morning to the Palace , where , in the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked . He took it apart , put it together again , explained the principles , and made records , until the young monarch knew almost as much about the phonograph as did the inventor . But his Majesty was not satisfied until he , too , had taken the thing to bits , put it together again , made records , and was able to explain things as readily as Mr. Wangemann . Then he desired the latter to bring the machine to the Palace again that evening in order that the Court might listen to it . He would not be required to lecture on the subject as his Majesty himself would attend to that part of the entertainment . Mr. Wangemann , of course , was quite agreeable and that night a brilliant assembly gathered at the Palace to hear the latest Edison wonder . The astonishment of those present , however , was increased a hundredfold when the Emperor himself appeared as lecturer , exhibiting the machine and explaining its mechanism as though he had spent his life in the Edison laboratory . With admiration they listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vibrations , and when he inserted a record , adjusted the machinery , set the electric motor going , and spoke to his audience through the medium of the phonograph , the excitement was intense , if suppressed . The royal lecturer remained for a couple of hours , alternately explaining details and reproducing records , // after which he withdrew , leaving behind him the impression among his courtiers that if the phonograph were wonderful the Emperor was more so . While Mr. Wangemann was still in Berlin , the Emperor again sent for him and requested that he would make some records of the playing of the Court orchestra . For this purpose the band assembled in the concert chamber , the performers being arranged according to their usual positions . Mr. Wangemann explained to the conductor that he would like to place the band a little differently , putting certain instruments a little further back and bringing others more to the front . But the conductor , a hot-tempered German , flatly declined to change the position of his men , ? they had always been placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great inventor himself , he was not going to alter them . In vain Dr. Wangemann argued with him that for the making of a successful record the instruments had to be arranged according to their power and quality , the less obtrusive tones being nearer and the loud or shrill tones more distant . But it was no good , the conductor was unconvinced , and the band would play according to his views or not at all . Then Dr. Wangemann appealed to the Emperor , and to convince his Majesty he took a cylinder of the playing of the orchestra in the positions the conductor insisted they should be . His Majesty listened critically to the result . Nothing but a confusion of sounds assailed his ears . Was that his own matchless orchestra ? Impossible . He ordered the conductor to place his men in any position Dr. Wangemann desired , and the musician sadly obeyed . Then the phonograph was adjusted and a record made . The difference was extraordinary , all the beauties of tone and orchestration being clearly brought out . // The Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dr. Wangemann his Majesty ordered the orchestra to play that evening in the position it would be if performing for the phonograph . At all future Imperial functions , however , the bandsmen returned to their ordinary places , greatly to the relief of the conductor and the comfort of the audience . Since then the German Emperor has taken the greatest interest in the progress made by the phonograph , and when a few years ago he was asked to give a record of his voice to be deposited in the Phonographic Archives at Harvard University , he graciously consented . The application was made by Dr. Edward Scripture , a psychologist , of Yale University , through the United States Ambassador in Berlin , and in a memorandum sent to the Court Marshal , Dr. Scripture wrote : " The Phonographic Archives are to include records from such persons as will presumably have permanent historical interest for America . The importance of the undertaking can be estimated by considering what would have been the present value of voice records by Demosthenes , Shakespeare , or Frederick the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first European record deposited in the Archives . " The Emperor received Dr. Scripture one Sunday after morning church , and referred to the occasion when Dr. Wangemann paid his first visit to Berlin so many years previously . During the making of the record the Emperor was alone with the phonograph . He spoke into it twice . The first cylinder , made specially for Harvard University , contained observations on Frederick the Great , while the other , intended for the Congressional Library and the National Museum , Washington , was a short disquisition on // " Fortitude in Pain . " His Majesty afterwards listened to some special records which Dr. Scripture had brought for the amusement of the Imperial family . During the early days of the phonograph it formed the basis of many amusing jokes in the Edison laboratory . The " boys " were not slow to find out that the matrix , after having been used to record one conversation or poem , as the case might be , would also admit of another being superinduced , the two being reported in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun was obtained . On one occasion the affecting words of the first verse of " Bingen on the Rhine " came out as follows : " A soldier of the legion lay dying in Algiers , Oh , shut up ! Oh , bag your head ! ' There was lack of woman 's nursing , there was Oh , give us a rest ! ' lack of woman 's tears . Dry up ! ' But a comrade stood beside him while his life Oh , what are you giving us ? Oh , ' blood ebbed away , cheese it ! ' And bent with pitying glances to hear what he Oh , you ca n't read poetry ! Let ' might say . ' up V The dying soldier faltered , and he took that corn'Police ! Police ! Po- ' rade 's hand , ' lice ! ' And he said , I shall never see my own , my , ' Oh , put him out ! Oh , cork ' native land . ' ' yourself ! ' " Edison enjoyed these phonographic liberties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // not slow to have his joke with the phonograph , and once hid a machine in a guest 's room . Just as his friend was about to get into bed a sepulchral voice exclaimed , " Eleven o'clock , one hour more ! " The visitor sat up for some time in anything but a peaceful frame of mind , but as nothing further happened he composed his nerves and lay down agdin . But sleep refused to visit his eyelids . He lay awake wondering what the end of the hour was to bring when the midnight chime sounded , and a second voice , deeper and more sepulchral than the first , groaned out , " Twelve o'clock , prepare to die ! " This was a little too much for the astonished guest , who leaped out of bed , opened the door , and dashed into the landing , where he was confronted by the inventor , who was holding his sides with suppressed laughter . The mystery was explained and the guest returned to his bed , much relieved , if somewhat abashed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many interesting experiments were made with the phonograph , and it was soon found that by reversing the machinery while working the most remarkable sound effects could be produced . One writer on the subject says : " It is impossible for the human voice to be so manipulated as to produce sounds exactly backwards . Even with the letter ' A , ' which is one of the simplest sounds made by the voice , the articulation can not be reversed . At the first thought it would ) appear that A ' is A ' no matter how it is said , backwards , or forwards , or sideways , but the phonograph shows this to be a mistake . The little intonation that follows the first sharp sound of the letter is scarcely noticeable when spoken , but when the phonograph is reversed it seems that it is a most important part of the sound . It is as though the phonograph were 1 // trying to say ear , ' but could not quite make it . The simplest sounds , such as the alphabet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek , and a complete sentence is worse than unintelligible . Musical sounds are reversed in the same way , and the intonation of a banjo makes that instrument sound like a church organ , while piano music would be thought to come from a harmonium by nine out of ten musicians . Such familiar pieces as Home , Sweet Home , ' lose their identity completely . In some cases music that is entirely new and very sweet is produced by the reversing process . This opens a new field for corn posers , as they can take ideas from a reversed phonograph without being accused of plagiarism . " The first public exhibition of the phonograph in England took place at the Crystal Palace in 1888 , but prior to that a " private view " was given at Norwood in the presence of a distinguished gathering , including Mr. Gladstone , Sir Morcll Mackenzie , the Earl of Aberdeen , Lord Rowton , Sir John Fowler , Sir William Hunter , and others equally noted . The entertainment consisted of various musical items specially chosen to display the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " Address " to the London press from the phonograph itself , and a " Salutation , " also supposed to have originated with the " talking machine . " Mr. Edison 's message was in the form of a private phonographic letter addressed to his agent , but nevertheless it was listened to by those present with greater interest than the songs or instrumental pieces which had preceded it . As this was the first letter in the form of a phonogram ever made by Edison , we can not refrain from quoting it . The following is an exact transcript : // " AHEM ! IN MY LABORATORY IN ORANGE , NEW JERSEY . " June 16 , 1888 , 3 o'clock A.M. " FRIEND GOURAUD , ? Ahem ! This is my first mailing phonogram . It will go to you in the regular United States mail from New York via Southampton , North German Lloyd Steamer Eider . I send you by Mr. Hamilton a new phonograph , the first one of the new model which has just left my hands . " It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you will see . I have sent you a quantity of experimental phonogram blanks , so that you can talk back to me . I will send you phonograms of talk and music by every mail leaving here until we get the best thing for the purpose of mailing . " Mrs. Edison and the baby are doing well . The baby 's articulation is quite loud enough , but a trifle indistinct ; it can be improved , but is not bad for a first experiment . " With kind regards , " Yours , " EDISON . " The greetings of the phonograph itself were in poetry as well as prose . The " Address " to the London press was given out in a clear , distinct voice as follows : " GENTLEMEN , ? In the name of Edison , to whose rare genius , incomparable patience , and indefatigable industry I owe my being , I greet you . I thank you for the honor you do me by your presence here to-day . My only regret is that my master is not here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . But in his absence I should be failing in my duty , as well as in my pleasure , // did I not take this , my first opportunity , to thank you and all the press of the great city of London , both present and absent , for the generous and flattering reception with which my coming to the Mother Country has been heralded by you to the world . " The " Phonograph 's Salutation " was composed and spoken into the machine by the Rev. Horatius Nelson Powers , D.D. , of Piermont on the Hudson . The poem is said to have received the commendations of Mr. Gladstone himself : " THE PHONOGRAPH 'S SALUTATION " I seize the palpitating air , I hoard Music and speech . All lips that breathe are mine ; I speak , the inviolable word Authenticates its origin and sign . I am a tomb , a Paradise , a shrine , An angel , prophet , slave , immortal friend ; My living records , in their native tone , Convict the knave , and disputations end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , Flawless as truth , and truth 's own tongue am I. I am a resurrection ; men may hear The quick and dead converse , as I reply . Hail ! English shores , and homes , and marts of peace , New trophies , Gouraud , yet are to be won . May sweetness , light , and brotherhood increase ; I am the latest born of Edison . " Edison was particularly anxious to obtain a record of Gladstone 's voice , and had given his agent strict injunctions , before leaving America , to ask the statesman to send him a phonographic message . At this 1 // " private view " the request was made , and Gladstone at once consented . The phonograph was adjusted , and into the receiver the late Premier spoke these words , addressed to the inventor : " I am profoundly indebted to you for , not the entertainment only , but the instruction and the marvels of one of the most remarkable evenings which it has been my privilege to enjoy . Your great country is leading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wish it well ; and to you , as one of its greatest celeb-rities , allow me to offer my hearty good wishes and earnest prayers that you may long live to witness its triumphs in all that appertains to the well-being of mankind . ? GLADSTONE . " The phonogram made by Gladstone was but the first of many which subsequently helped to form a wonderful collection of " voices of the great " now in the " Wizard 's " possession at Llewellyn Park . The collection includes records made by Bismarck , Tenny-son , Beecher , Browning , and many other famous men living at the time of the perfecting of the phonograph . Years after Gladstone had " talked back , " as Edison termed it , the explorer Stanley and his wife visited the inventor 's laboratory at Orange , and while listen-ing to the phonograph Mrs. Stanley said to Edison , " Whose voice , of all the great men of the past , would you like best to recall and register ? " The questioi had never been put to Edison before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tones which showed clearly that he had fully made up his mind , he replied , " Napo-leon 's . " The visitors , somewhat surprised , suggested that in past centuries there were voices of other men greater than Napoleon . The argument waxed warm , but Edison never wavered in his choice . Napoleon 's // was the voice he wanted to hear most , and for it he was willing to barter the entire collection of records then in his possession . The phonograph has made its way into strange lands , and there are now probably few places on the globe where its voice has not been heard . " In 1897 , " says a writer , " it appeared , for the first time , in Lhassa , Thibet , the religious capital of the Buddhist faith . To this ancient town no European or other man than a Buddhist is supposed to be allowed to penetrate , though , as a matter of fact , some Europeans have been there and returned safe and sound . Travellers of the Buddhist faith may visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Christians . Among such travellers was a certain Burmese merchant , who , familiar with the resources of civilization , took with him , to show the Grand Lama , or sacred and miraculously appointed Head of the Buddhist Church , an Edison phonograph . This was a good idea on the part of the Burmese trader , for in the Buddhist cult great account is made of mechanically repeated prayers . Praying wheels to reel off written or printed prayers are employed , and it struck the merchant that if he could introduce a machine which would actually repeat the prayers aloud he might make a fortune in supplying the apparatus . " He succeeded in getting the Grand or Dalai Lama and the dignitaries that surround him to inspect the phonograph , and as he had read into it a chapter of the sacred writings of the Buddhists , he was able to make it repeat this chapter aloud , to the great astonishment of the Grand Lama , who thought he was witnessing a miracle . The merchant asked the Dalai Lama to speak into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer called Om mani padme // cum , ' or Jewel in the Lotus . ' Then the cylinder being put in place the phonograph repeated the prayer in the Dalai Lama 's voice , to the stupefaction and great edification of all the auditors . For many days thereafter the phonograph was kept busy with this and other utterances holy to the Buddhists , and now the phonograph has taken its place as the favorite praying machine ' of Lhassa . " In Russia the phonograph did not receive quite so hearty a welcome , and it was some time before it was looked upon with anything like favor by the Russian Government . Even to-day all records have first to be submitted to the " Press Censor " before they can be enjoyed by the public , and it is a serious offence to have in one 's possession a cylinder which has not been inspected by the censor . Ten years ago in the pavilion of the public gardens in Tagonrog the machine was exhibited for the first time and attracted large crowds . It played and sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer heard the machine reciting one of Kirloff 's famous fables , but with some variations of the original text . The officer got suspicious , and , not trusting to his memory , he ran at once and got Kirloff 's book , and came again , to listen to the phonograph 's version of the fable . To his horror he found the fable reproduced not at all as it was passed by the censorship more than half a century ago . An alarm was raised at once , the higher local authorities communicated with , and the manager of the pavilion was called upon to explain the conduct of that " speaking mechanical beast . " All the poor manager could do was to open the mysterious inside of the criminal machine , and hand over to the authorities the indiscreet cylinder which threatened to tell the peaceful inhabitants so many undesirable // things . But the arrest of the chief criminal was considered insufficient , as it could not have acted without a human accomplice , and so the poor manager was haled to court , sentenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the forfeiture of his phonograph , which was forthwith smashed to pieces by the sensitive officials . The phonograph has been employed for many queer purposes , perhaps the queerest being to assist a certain American professor in his study of the language of cats . , This gentleman interested himself many years ago ? together with one or two others ? in the Simian language , but ultimately abandoned the problem of interpreting " monkey talk " in order to find out what a cat means when it stands on the back fence at night and emits those blood-curdling cries which make householders so reckless regarding their personal property . " It is not easy , " said this gentleman to the writer , " to secure good records of cat language , and , in fact , I have waited night after night in my backyard for the purpose only to be disappointed . It is , of course , necessary to place the phonograph pretty near the cats ' rendezvous in order to bottle up their voices , and it is seldom that . felines are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their surroundings . One record took me several nights to secure , and the reason that I did finally succeed was almost due to an accident . These particular cats were known for a mile around , and I do not suppose there was any one occupying a room looking on the back who had not voluntarily lost property in a vain endeavor to break up their musical evenings . But the cats seemed to lead charmed lives , and the manner in which they dodged missiles and at the same time i6o THOMAS ALVA EDISON continued singing was marvellous . But having made up my mind to secure a record of their voices , I crept into a dark corner of my yard one night and awaited their coming . For four evenings in succession they had been tuning up just below my window , and whether they had got wind that I was there with the phonograph and felt shy in consequence I do n't know , but they never showed up that night , though I could hear them halfway down the block giving No. 19 a serenade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold that I packed up my machine and went to bed , but I had scarcely got between the sheets when I heard them below singing away as though their hardened hearts would burst . I slipped on a pair of trousers , grabbed the phonograph , opened the back door and crept out . They were on the top of the water-butt , and I was quietly making my way towards them when I fell over the india-rubber plant and with an car-splitting yell they disappeared . The next night and the next I had no better luck , and I was almost giving up in despair when a friend suggested that I should place the phonograph in the yard , run an electric wire from the motor into my room and await the cats ' arrival comfortably in bed . That very night I tried the experiment . Placing the phonograph in . a spot which appeared to be a favorite one with the cats ( to judge by the queer things I used to pick up near it ) I adjusted the horn , arranged the wire so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then returned to bed . I was just beginning to feel sleepy when they arrived . They must have taken their stand quite close to the phonograph , and it was n't long before they began their choir practice . When they were fairly started I pressed the button and set the machinery in motion . The yowling became awful after a bit , and I was very 1 // much afraid that the missiles which began to fly would strike my machine , but fortunately they did n't , and when I thought I had secured a sufficient quantity of the cats ' vocal powers I put on some clothes and brought in the phonograph . When I tested the record I found it an excellent one . 1 was exceptionally lucky in this instance , for a few nights later the cats completely and mysteriously disappeared . I am afraid that they finally fell victims to their art , and we shall never hear their voids again , save in the phonograph . " I have , by the aid of Mr. Edison 's invention , secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded or sick cat emits a peculiarly mournful sound quite different from its ordinary voice ) , cats spitting , and so forth . It is not difficult to secure the record of an angry cat 's voice , for all you have , to do is to hold the animal near the mouth of the phonograph and give its tail a twist . It will make plenty of noise then , but I never follow this method myself as I only wish to obtain records of the natural voice . All together I have secured twenty-five cat records , which repeat twenty-five different cries . I believe that when a cat yowls at night she has some object in view other than that of annoying the neighbors , though I know the majority of people would n't believe you if you said so . I am convinced there is a cat language just as there is a Simian language , and if I live long enough I am going to find out what it means . I feel I have a difficult task before me , but with the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed . " Sometimes I place the phonograph near my own cat ( a quiet respectable parlor animal that does n't go out at night ) and turn on a few nocturnal yowls for her especial benefit . When she hears the sounds of the other cats having a good time she races round // the room in a remarkable manner and does her best to perform a feline harlequin act through the window . It is perfectly evident that she knows what is being said , and if she 'd only respond in some intelligible way I should begin to understand . However , I am not without hope . " I have succeeded in determining by the aid of the phonograph the different emotions of cats , and can tell fairly accurately which is the cry of fear , of delight , of contempt , of amusement , and of affection . I can also tell the peculiar cry a cat makes when he or she wishes to attract a friend 's attention , and also the sound of warning on the approach of an enemy . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Feline Language illustrated with cat cries on the phonograph . People will laugh , of course , but I hope in the end that they will come to believe with me that even cats have a language of their own , and one which , if we study sufficiently , we shall some day understand . " As a matter of fact , the phonograph has been put to queerer uses than Edison ever anticipated . Here is one case which greatly amused the inventor when he heard of it . About two years ago in one of the busiest parts of London , where almost the entire road is taken up with costers ' barrows , Edison 's invention played an important part in helping the proprietor of a big stand to dispose of his entire stock of " greens . " Around the well-filled barrow a crowd of hilarious buyers and idlers congregated , while one could distinctly hear above the general clamor a voice in coster accents declaring that " termarters " were " tuppence a pahnd " and " green peas fippence the ' alf peck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information would not have attracted more than the usual number of Saturday night buyers , but the reason of the // jostling crowd became clear when it was observed that the voice proceeded apparently from the very midst of the vegetables , while the owner of the cart , a delicate , weak-looking man , stood quietly by attending to his customers ' wants without saying a word . When asked to explain the meaning of this strange affair the colter replied in husky tones that some months ago he had almost entirely lost his voice through an attack of fever , and was subsequently in great danger of also losing his trade through being unable to announce the quality and price of his goods in tones equal to those of his competitors , when a friend suggested that he should engage the services of a phonograph to discharge that duty for him . The idea was a good one , and the coster promptly adopted it with the most satisfactory results , the " talking machine " generally enabling him to sell out his entire stock while his rivals were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract customers . The records were made for him by a friendly coster whose voice was the pride and admiration of the entire push-cart " community . Frank D. Millet , and other artists , often make use of the phonograph while painting a portrait , as they declare that it helps to banish the bored look which a subject usually assumes when sitting for any length of time . In the case of children especially they find that the little one is able to sit much longer without becoming restless or fatigued if the phonograph is turning out melodies or funny speeches . The smile becomes natural and the expression interested ? a state of things which , under ordinary circumstances , is sometimes impossible to obtain . Many other amusing , interesting , or remarkable incidents in connection with the phonograph might 1G THOMAS ALVA EDISON be related were it not that their recital would possibly prove tedious , for so accustomed have we become to the " talking machine , " and so true is it that familiarity breeds contempt that it is now difficult to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rising generation who have always had the phonograph with them can not be expected to regard it as so great a wonder as do those who have followed its development from its inception , but , nevertheless , even in the dim future , it will probably still remain one of the most marvellous inventions of the nineteenth century . CHAPTER XI THE KINETOSCOPE , MAGNETIC ORE SEPARATOR , AND OTHER INVENTIONS IT was during the year 1887 that Edison invented the " Kinetoscope , " or moving picture machine . The idea was not an original one , nor does he claim it to have been , but frankly states that it was suggested to him by that interesting little instrument called the Zoetrope . Edison had known this toy for many years , and after he had invented the phonograph he argued that it should be possible to make a machine " which would do for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear . " Later , when the kinetoscope was perfected , he declared that it would be comparatively easy to combine the two inventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage of a theatre ? the acting and singing being supplied entirely by the kinetoscope and phonograph . During the spring of 1907 the writer questioned Edison on the subject , and he replied : " The time is coming when the moving picture and the phonograph will be combined so naturally that we shall be able to show a trumpeter or any other musician so life-like in appearance that when he puts his instrument to his lips it will be impossible for any one to say positively that it is not the living man himself who is playing . I look forward to the day when we shall give grand opera in so realistic a manner that the critics themselves will be deceived . We are work-165 // ing on these lines now , and though the difficulties are great we shall overcome them by and by . " The invention of the kinetoscope took Edison into a realm of science into which he had not previously penetrated ? that of photography . Up to the time when the idea of the kinetoscope first occurred to him he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , touched a camera . But he soon saw that if he was to have any success with his new enterprise he must study the subject of photography from A to Z , and with his customary enthusiasm he threw himself at once into the work of mastering the art . He realized that the pictures , to indicate natural movements successfully when thrown on a screen , would have to be taken with extraordinary celerity ? from forty to sixty a second , in fact . By this means only would the eye be unable to detect the change from one position to the other . Edison endeavored to find plates ( films ) which would be quick enough to do this , and discovered that there were none in existence . Thereupon he opened a photographic laboratory and by innumerable experiments succeeded in making films sufficiently quick for his purpose . He learned all there was to learn regarding the taking , developing , printing , and toning of negatives , and soon began to make discoveries which were of inestimable benefit to him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assistance of W. K. L. Dickson , who labored unceasingly with his chief in the development of the machine . The two men worked together early and late , and thousands of experiments were made before the results satisfied them . From the very first , of course , it was necessary that the photographs should be taken on strips of film , // and literally miles of this sensitive material were exposed for the purpose of obtaining interesting subjects for the kinetoscope . Every sort of incident was photographed , and the assistants in the laboratory were called upon to go through all kinds of " turns " ( or " stunts , " as they called them ) for the benefit of the kinetoscope . Fred Ott , who was known to occasionally indulge in the luxury of an ear-splitting sneeze , was requested to give an illustration of his famous performance before the moving picture camera . He protested at first but was compelled to yield , and by some means or other known only to himself was able to go through all the grimaces of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rate of fifty pictures to the second . Boys in the laboratory were told to turn somersaults , stand on their heads , play leap-frog , and perform other manoeuvres supposed to be dear to youth , while various members of Edison 's staff were " taken " busily engaged experimenting . When these pictures were thrown on to the screen they caused the liveliest interest and amusement . Edison himself was asked to give " sittings , " but declined . Then when the machine came nearer to being the perfected thing it is to-day a stage was put up in the Orange laboratory and various celebrated dancers came down from New York ? Miss Loie Fuller among the number ? and rehearsed their dances before the kinetoscope . All this , of course , cost a good deal of money , and it is more than probable that this invention gobbled up at least a hundred thousand dollars before it could be considered a commercial success . Later on Mr. Dickson obtained special permission to make some moving pictures of Pope Leo XIII. , on which occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only by great diplomacy , " said Mr. t 8 THOMAS ALVA EDISON Dickson afterwards , " that I obtained the necessary permission , and it was a good deal due to the kindness of Count Pecci , the Pope 's nephew , that I succeeded . And after I had entered the Vatican and commenced operations ' I was much afraid that the Pope would send out word that he was too fatigued to appear . True , he had given me an appointment , but I imagined that indisposition , or the weather , or a dozen unlooked for events would cause a postponement . But I was mistaken . His Holiness had set a date in April , and  - -  kept it . I made 17,000 photographs during that and subsequent days , and all the time the Pope was kindness itself . I and my assistant had to dress in black , and before we commenced the work of photographing his Holiness we were drilled in various formalities which had to be observed . The Pope himself was extremely interested in everything , and I had to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pictures were made while the Pontiff was on his way to the Sistine Chapel , being driven thither in his carriage . I explained to him that in order to obtain good results it would be necessary to have the hood down , and he cheerfully consented to its being lowered . He held an umbrella over his head , for the sun was hot , but this he closed as soon as I began to make the pictures . Another series of photographs showed the Pope , with uplifted finger , bestowing the Apostolic benediction on an imaginary crowd , while a third depicted him walking in the Vatican grounds . The Pope afterwards witnessed many of these moving pictures , and showed unbounded delight and wonder at the faithfulness of the reproductions . Now , ' he said on this occasion , turning to Cardinal Rampolla , I know how I look when I am blessing my people . ' " // During these days when rumor was busy with the " sensations " to be depicted by means of the kinetoscope , an announcement appeared in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had permitted a bond fide prize fight to take place in his laboratory for a series of moving pictures , . he pugilists being the noted jim Corbett and a Jerseyman . One-ounce gloves were used , and the prize was a purse of five thousand dollars , it was stated . This , however , was an exaggeration , as no purse was offered . Since those days the kinetoscope has been accused of reproducing greater sensations than a prize fight ? among other things the agonized contortions of a negro being burned at the stake ? but these are merely " newspaper stories " which have originated in the brains of imaginative space writers . Of the many thousand series of moving pictures which have issued from the Edison laboratory there has not been a single instance of one calculated to produce a " sensation " in the generally accepted sense of the word . And the same thing may be said of Edison 's phonographic records . Another invention on which Edison worked soon after he had conceived the idea of the kinetoscope was the magnetic ore separator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the non-magnetic . The origin of this invention is interesting . It is stated that Edison was one day walking along the sea-coast when he came across a patch of black sand . Curious to know what it contained , he filled his pockets with it , and when he returned to the laboratory he poured it out on to the bench . As he did so , a workman stumbled against the table and dropped the big magnet he was carrying across the sand . When he picked it up again it was covered ' 7o THOMAS ALVA EDISON with tiny black grains , proving the sand to consist chiefly of metallic particles . Edison took the magnet in his own hands , and sitting there became lost in thought . His mind was busy with fresh ideas which the accidental dropping of the magnet had generated . He saw no reason why magnetic attraction should not be employed to separate the metal from low-grade ores , and there and then he commenced his experiments which ultimately gave birth to what is now known as the magnetic ore separator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally brought it to such a state of perfection that , by his system , a piece of ore weighing a couple of tons may be crushed to powder , and the metal extracted by means of an electro-magnet . The method is an extremely simple one , the crushed ore being allowed to fall in a steady stream from a hopper past the electromagnet , which attracts the iron particles and causes them to curve away and fall into a bin under it . The non-magnetic substances , being uninfluenced by the magnet , fall straight and are collected in another bin placed directly beneath the hopper . In connection with this separation of ores by magnetic attraction , Edison had to invent a tremendous amount of machinery , which included crushers , pulverizers , conveyers , and presses , before the scheme was workable . Then he bought a big tract of land in Sussex County and commenced operations . A little town soon sprang up , which was called " Edison " after the founder , and about two hundred neat houses were erected . The work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Edison is said to have put several hundred thousands of dollars into the venture ; but the shipping facilities were bad , and ten years ago the works were shut down and the // inhabitants began gradually to creep away , until to-day " Edison " is deserted . The magnetic ore separator is still regarded as the best and simplest method of separating iron from low-grade ores , and the system , is carried on in many parts of the world . In Edison 's case , however , it was one of those things which , while successful as an invention , was not so financially , and he therefore closed down the mine and turned his attention to other things more remunerative . No one lives at Edison now , and it is as lonely and silent as the " Deserted Village . " Many of the buildings still stand , but they are falling quickly to decay , and the little houses where the miners and operators used to dwell , and which were lighted by electricity and contained all " modern conveniences , " seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At one time Edison was the most up-todate mining town in America , and people came for miles to see the magnetic ore separator , but when the works were closed down there was nothing there which would support a community , and so the inhabitants . drifted away . A few hopeful ones remained behind and endeavored to eke out a living , but it was too strenuous an existence , and after a few months they too fled . The inventor never once revisited the little town named in his honor , after finally turning his back upon it now nearly ten years ago . A far more prosperous undertaking is Edison 's method of turning rock and limestone into cement . His works for this purpose are situated at Stewartsville , N. J. , and cover close upon eight hundred acres of ground . A short description of his methods in this line may not be without interest . The rock after blasting is picked up by ninety-ton vulcan steam shovels , which are the most powerful things of the // kind in the world . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of rock as though it were a walnut and handle it as freely as a child would a rubber ball . These giant pieces of stone are loaded on " skips " and drawn by locomotives about a mile distant to the " crushers . " In the crushing house are terrible-looking rollers capable of breaking up a fiveton piece of rock as easily as a pair of nut crackers would smash a filbert . These rolls are five feet long and fifteen feet in circumference , each roller alone , without any of its appurtenances , weighing twentyfive tons . They are made of chilled iron plates and rotate in opposite directions . The motors which work these rollers are enclosed in dust-proof chambers , for otherwise they would soon become clogged with the powdery particles which rise from the crushers like gigantic clouds . The rock is clumped into these crushers direct from the " skips , " and some idea of the former 's appetite may be gathered from the fact that they eat up no less than fifteen tons of material every four minutes . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoppers feeding a set of thirty-sixinch rolls ? so called because they are thirty-six inches long and thirty-six inches in diameter . These rolls break up the rock in pieces about the size of one 's fist , after which it passes through a second and third set of crushers , finally emerging broken up in pieces of the size of lump sugar . The rock is now ready for the drying room . Here it is dropped upon grates heated by gases and shaken until thoroughly dried . Then it goes to the stockhouse ? an immense building 500 feet long containing ten bins , each one capable of holding 1500 tons . Six of these bins are used for the cement rock , three for carbonate of lime , and one // for mixing . Mixing is absolutely necessary , for the rock never contains the same amount of lime , and in order to give satisfactory results the proportions must be " just so . " The cement rock and the limestone are next taken to the storehouse , which contains two bins each with a capacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carefully followed by the mixers . So much limestone must go with so much rock . The quantities are weighed automatically by a process highly interesting to the visitor . Each bin ( one containing limestone and the other rock ) deposits so much of its contents into the scale , which is worked electrically so that when the right quantity has been dropped into the weighing pan further supply is instantly cut off by the scale beam closing an electrical circuit . The cement rock and limestone then pass through chutes into a feed roll which thoroughly mixes the two materials . After passing under chalk grinding rolls the mixture arrives at the summit of the " blower-house , " from which it falls through grids . As it falls a current of air is passed through it , the fine dust being carried to a large settling chamber where it accumulates in miniature mountains at the bottom . The coarser material which has defied the " blowers " is returned to the chalk crushers for further reduction . The pressure of these rollers varies from 14,000 to 18,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a Zoo-mesh screen , " bagged " and " barrelled " by machinery , and conveyed to the forwarding-houses . The roasters are 150 feet long , made of cast iron lined with fire-brick , and built in the form of huge cylindrical shells . On the outside they are nine feet in diameter and on the inside six feet . Each roaster can turn out 900 barrels of cement every twenty-four // hours . As a rule the works are in action during the night as well as the day , and the great crushers revolve ceaselessly from year 's end to year 's end . Most of the machinery used in these cement works is the result of Edison 's inventive mind , and there are a hundred other interesting facts connected with the making of Portland cement by his remarkable system which it is impossible to touch upon here . Mention , however , may be made of a wonderful electrical signalling apparatus recently erected whereby the manager in his office may communicate with the heads of the different departments without leaving his desk , while by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call a messenger at any time during the night or day . There is also a remarkable system of oiling whereby every part of the machinery is automatically lubricated . The oil passes continuously through the machinery , is collected ( by gravity ) in tanks , filtered , and again used . After filtration and re-filtration the oil is pumped into tanks situated at the top of each building , from which it again drops to the different parts of the machinery . The supply is regulated by means of needle valves . Edison is also the originator of a novel method of building houses of solid concrete . He was some years working out the details of this scheme to his own satisfaction , but twelve months ago he completed his experiments and now it is possible to " build " a tenroom house in about four days . The simple method is as follows : a steel mould is made into which the concrete is pumped , allowed to harden , and the mould then removed . At present an entire house has not been made in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceilings are made by pouring concrete into separate moulds and afterwards piecing them together . // Even the window frames are temporary shells into which concrete is pumped . When these shells are removed they leave behind solid window frames which it will take centuries to weaken . The origin of Edison 's idea is said to have been the increasing cost of brick and lumber . The time will most certainly come when whole houses will be turned out in one piece , though each part is now separately moulded . These metallic moulds may be ornate or plain as the fancy of the householder dictates , and it will be no dearer to have the latter than the former . It only requires some smart architects to draw up designs for a few houses of different patterns and of about the size to suit the family of the average mechanic . The moulds made for each part of the house may even be joined together before the concrete has been pumped in . If more convenient , then the parts may be made separately and joined together with cement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it is considered better to leave the liquid material in the moulds for four days , when the latter may be removed with perfect confidence that a solid and almost bomb-proof house will remain behind . Moulds for a house of ten rooms would cost about $25,000 , but they could be used five hundred times if necessary , so that the charge of $500 for a dwelling of the size mentioned would pay the builder very handsomely . This idea of erecting houses in moulds is a very simple and feasible one , and it seems strange that it should have occurred to no one until Edison suggested it . In America to-day many houses are being erected according to Edison 's plans , and are fulfilling all that was expected of them . CHAPTER XII SOME LESSER INVENTIONS EDIsoN 's work as an inventor extends over a most varied field . In addition to his better-known patents , granted in connection with the development of the electric lamp , the phonograph , the telephone , oremilling machinery , and storage-batteries , the inventions include typewriters , electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserving fruit , cast-iron manufacture , wire-drawing , electric locomotives , moving-picture machines , the making of plate glass , compressed-air apparatus , and many other things . To describe these numerous inventions in detail would take up too great a part of this book , but a brief description of some of them is necessary in order to convey to the reader a faint idea of the tremendous scope of Edison 's researches . He has been by far the most prolific inventor and patentee of any time , having filed more than twelve hundred applications in America alone , for which over eight hundred patents have so far been granted . For foreign patents in most of the countries of the world his applications number more than two thousand . Such a record as this is unique , yet because the public has come to regard Edison as a kind of favored mortal to whom Nature generously whispers her secrets , the inventor scarcely receives that amount of credit for the work entailed to which he is entitled . 176 // The commonly accepted idea of him is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brain , or that he has the singular good fortune to be the instrument whereby Nature communicates her discoveries . Neither of these views is correct . Edison draws a very broad line between " discovery " and " invention . " In his parlance a discovery is a " scratch " ? something that might be disclosed to any one , and for which he thinks little or no credit is due . Invention , on the other hand , is the result of that peculiar faculty which perceives the application of some phenomenon or action to a new use . As an inventor , therefore , Edison possesses two qualifications preeminently . First , the inventive faculty , or the special intuition by which the adaptability of some observed result to a useful end is presented ; and secondly , the physical energy and patience necessary for the investigation by which that result may be ascertained . Although capable of flashes of great genius , his mind is necessarily analytical , and when a problem is presented to his attention it may be safely presumed that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful selected . Notwithstanding this mental equipment , his success has depended very largely on his physical make-up , as well as upon a certain solidity of his nervous system that takes no account of fatigue or ennui . In other words , day after day , with only a few hours ' sleep , he can devote himself enthusiastically to the investigation of a single problem the very monotony of which would drive most men into nervous prostration . In a recent argument in a suit on one of Edison 's patents opposing counsel sought to show that Edison was more an inventor than a discoverer , and the // remark made was entirely complimentary . Said the learned gentleman : " If your honor wished him to , Mr. Edison could go into a field of grass a mile square and select therefrom. , , the most perfect blade ! " The popular conception of Edison is that of a man who accomplishes startling results by instantaneous flashes of intellect . The real Edison is a man of indefatigable industry , who attains his ends by patient effort intelligently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few real discoveries have been made by him . In one of them experiments were being made in the early days with automatic telegraphs , where the effect of the current was to produce chemical changes in moving paper strips with various substances . In making these experiments Edison held in his hand a pen , through which the current passed , and which pressed upon the strip . It was found that , with some chemicals , the passage of the current increased the friction between the pen and the strip , so as to subject the pen to slight pulls . Later , when experimenting with the telephone , these earlier observances occurred to him , and as a result the " motograph , " or " chalk telephone receiver , " was invented , wherein the same phenomena take place . Although this work Edison regards as a " scratch , " probably very few men would have had the inventive faculty to foresee that the original discovery could have been used for making a new telephone . At the Paris Exposition of 1889 the chief attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created an immense sensation . The following year they were shown in the United States , and visited by hundreds of thousands of individuals interested in the progress of invention . Each exhibit was accomSOME // panied by a card giving a short description of the invention , and there was also published a small descriptive catalogue or pamphlet , prepared by the late Luther Stieringer , friend and co-worker of Edison , and to this little work ? copies of which are now very difficult to obtain ? I am indebted for the succinct descriptions of some of these lesser-known inventions . Stieringer was with Edison in the early Menlo Park days , and worked almost as untiringly and energetically as the inventor himself . He ultimately became famous in the electrical world through his development of the wiring system , and the illuminating effects which he obtained when the electric light was yet in its infancy will always be remembered in the history of the incandescent lamp . The lighting of the Omaha Exposition was carried out by Stieringer with such consummate skill , and the electrical effects were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his honor and presented to him as a small recognition of the success of his work . The illuminations of the Grand Court at the World 's Fair , Chicago , were also placed in his hands , and again he proved in a remarkable way the possibilities of electric lighting . Stieringer owned the first electrolier ever made , and this was shown , among other interesting Edison exhibits , at the St. Louis Exposition of 1904 . Stieringer was one of Edison 's stanchest admirers , and the inventor 's capacity for work was a source of constant wonderment to him . He it was who on one occasion declared his belief that if Edison could have chosen his birthplace he would have located it in the planet Mars , so as to have secured the advantages of a day forty minutes longer than ours . It was with Edison 's sanction that Stieringer prepared the pamphlet , already referred to , descriptive of those // inventions which he knew so well , and the majority of which he had seen grow from crude beginnings to perfected entities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from Edison , empowering him to investigate anything and everything which he considered might prove of use or interest to the inventor . Any scientific door which was double-locked or which bore the legend " No Admittance " immediately attracted Stieringer 's attention , and he never rested night or clay until he had opened it . Of the many men who gathered around Edison in the days when the brilliancy of his inventive genius began to be recognized Stieringer takes a high place , and his death was a very real loss to the scientific and electrical world . Mention has already been made of the fact that the motograph was invented at a time when Edison was experimenting with automatic telegraphs . Another invention which came to him about : the same period was the electric pen . This was one of his most useful clerical devices , and its great success was soon proved by the number of imitations which immediately afterwards began to flood the market . The instrument , as originally conceived , was very simple in construction , consisting , as it did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ordinary penholder , fitted with a steel shaft . Attached to the head of the pen was a tiny motor communicating with the shaft , while a needle projected from the writing end of the instrument and performed the duties of a pen-point . To work the pen the miniature motor was attached to a battery by flexible wires , and when in operation the steel shaft vibrated at so great a speed that the needle , on being guided over the surface of a sheet of paper , perforated iL By means of this electric pen the stencil of a plan a // or letter was made , and then , with the help of a duplicating press and an inked roller , as many copies could be run off as were required . Soon after this novel pen made its appearance many so-called inventors attempted to better and cheapen it . Among these was a New Orleans man , who got up a pneumatic pen on the same principle , except that it was worked by air . Instead of the steel shaft a small tube was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the pen , and that moved the needle . The motor was in the form of a tiny bellows operated by clockwork . " It was all beautifully simple , " said the luckless inventor some years later , " and I figured out that it could be sold for half the price of the electric machine . I believed I was on the eve of reaping a big harvest when Edison thought again , and calmly knocked me out by merely fastening a diminutive toothed wheel to the point of a pencil . When the pencil was moved over the paper the wheel naturally revolved , and the teeth cut the stencil . It cost about a dollar to make , and shelved both the electric and pneumatic pens in just one fell swoop . When I heard of Edison 's improvement I could n't understand why I had n't thought of it myself , but inventions are mighty queer things , anyway . " The mimeograph , with which every city clerk is familiar , followed close on the heels of the electric pen . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet was equally useful for manifolding manuscript . The apparatus consisted of a steel plate , a sheet of sensitive paper , and a stylus . The paper was laid on the smooth plate , over which the stylus glided with the greatest ease , perforating the sensitive sheet . In this way a stencil was made from which any number of copies could be rolled off . By placing // the stencil paper , backed with a piece of silk , in the typewriter , and removing the ribbon , the same result may be obtained for manifolding typewritten matter . The mimeograph was immediately recognized as an indispensable piece of office furniture , and to-day it is to be found in thousands of business houses . As far back as 1885 Edison applied for a patent covering wireless telegraphy , and was allowed one in 18gi , but he did not pursue his investigations in this direction with his customary zeal . He was content to give way to Marconi , for whom he has a very sincere admiration . Edison 's " grasshopper telegraph was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving trains . The feature of this system was the absence of any special wire between or along the tracks . Electrical induction served to transfer the currents from the apparatus in the train to the ordinary Morse wires alongside the track , no other medium than the air being required to facilitate the transfer . The currents which were thus induced in the wires did not in any way interfere with the ordinary business which was being carried on over them . The apparatus on the train and at the stations along the line consisted of an ordinary battery , an induction coil with vibrator , a Morse key , and a pair of telephone receivers . By means of the induction coil the current from the battery was transformed into a rapidly alternating , highly penetrative current , capable of producing a similar current in neighboring wires or apparatus . The effect was a continuous humming sound heard in the phonetic receivers , this being broken into the dots and dashes of the Morse system by means of the key . The roofs of the cars were all connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to the earth // through the car-wheels and track . By means of this simple and inexpensive system messages have been transmitted across an air space of S6o feet intervening between the wires and the cars . The " grasshopper telegraph " was , at one time , used on many of the long-distance trains of America , but it never became a very great commercial success , probably for the reason that few people find it necessary to send mes-sages while travelling by rail ? even in the United States . In the perfecting of this invention Edison worked in cooperation with W. Wiley Smith , who therefore shares with the inventor the distinction of originating this unique form of telegraphy . While engaged in his acoustic researches , carried on in connection with the telephone , the idea occurred to Edison that it would not be difficult to construct an instrument whereby two persons at considerable distance from each other might carry on a conversa-tion without unduly straining their lungs . So he set to work and evolved the megaphone . To-day that instrument is still largely employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though its con-struction is somewhat different to what it was at the time of its invention . In those days " twin " funnels were employed , made either of metal or wood , each funnel being from 6 to 8 feet in length , with a width from 30 to 36 inches at the mouths . These huge funnels ended in tiny apertures , which were provided with tubes , and which the operator placed in his ears . Between the funnels was a large speaking trumpet , and the whole apparatus was mounted on a substan-tial steel tripod . Remarkable results were obtained by using these megaphones , and two people provided with instruments were able to keep up a conversation at a distance of two miles without in any way raining // their voices above the normal . The telephone has rendered the megaphone less useful than it might otherwise have proved , but it remains , nevertheless , one of Edison 's most valuable inventions connected with acoustics . Another invention ? more interesting , perhaps , than useful ? also owes its being to experimental work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phonomotor , " or " vocal engine . " It consists of a mouthpiece and a diaphragm , to the centre of which is attached a brass rod carrying a steel pawl ; the pawl acts on a ratchet wheel with very fine teeth , mounted on a shaft carrying a flywheel , and driving a colored disk by means of a belt or cord . The vibrations of the voice ? which he had discovered were capable of developing considerable energy ? in speaking or sing ing into the instrument , caused the pawl to impinge upon the teeth of the ratchet-wheel , producing a rapid rotation of the flywheel and colored plate ; a continuous sound gives the flywheel such momentum that considerable force is needed to stop it . By means of this queer toy it is quite possible to bore a hole through a board or even saw wood . Two startling inventions in connection with astronomy and hydrography are the work of Edison . These are , respectively , the tasimeter and the odoroscope . The former is an ingenious instrument in which the electrical resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other of Edison 's inventions . The name " tasimeter " is derived from the words meaning " extension " and " measure , " because the effect is primarily to measure extension of any kind . The apparatus consists of a strip of hard rubber with pointed ends resting perpendicularly on a platinum plate beneath which is a carbon button , and below this SOME LESSER TNVENTIONS IS another platinum plate . The two plates and the carbon button form part of an electric circuit containing a battery and a galvanometer . The hard rubber is exceedingly sensitive to heat ; the slightest degree of warmth imparted to it causes it to expand , thus increasing the pressure on the carbon button and producing a variation in the resistance of the circuit , which is , of course , immediately registered by the galvanometer . The instrument is so sensitive that with a delicate galvanometer the warmth of a person 's hand at a distance of thirty feet affects it very considerably . In astronomical observations it has been used most successfully . On one occasion the heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very satisfactory manner . The principle of the odoroscope is similar to that of the tasimeter , but a strip of gelatine takes the place of the hard rubber . Besides being affected by heat , it is exceedingly sensitive to moisture , a few drops of water thrown on the floor of the room being sufficient to give a very decided indication on the galvanometer in circuit with the instrument . Barometers , hygrometers , and similar instruments of great delicacy can be constructed on the principle of the odoroscope , and it may be employed in determining the character or pressure of gases and vapor in which it is placed . Other inventions of F.dison 's ? too technical for description in a work such as this ? are the carbon rheostat , an instrument for altering the resistance of an electrical circuit ; the pressure or carbon relay , for the translation of signals of variable strengths from one circuit to another ; acoustic telegraph system , chemical telegraph , private line printers , printing telegraphs , clectro-magnets , rheot:omes or circuit directors , telegraph calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how important it was that dynamos should be made with massive field-magnets . His first large steam dynamo was built at Menlo Park , and was used to supply the current for 700 lamps . In 1881 he built a dynamo of a size which staggered the electrical world . It weighed twenty-seven tons , the armature being built of bars of copper instead of wire , which alone weighed six tons . It was exhibited at Paris , London , Milan , and New York , and created the greatest sensation . The pyro-magnetic motor , the pyro-magnetic generator , the microphone ( called after him ) , the magnetic bridge ( for testing the magnetic properties of iron ) , the electro-motograph , the motograph receiver , the etheroscope , the chalk battery , methods for preserving fruit in vacua without cooking , vacuum pumps , the telephonograph , and the " dead beat " galvanometer ( peculiar from the fact that it has no coils or magnetic needle ) are a few more inventions for which Edison has been granted patents . It might here be mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patents , and this is the case with several of Edison 's conceptions . In the line of phonographs , for instance , he has secured a hundred and one patents , on storage batteries twenty patents , on electric meters twenty patents , on telegraphs a hundred and forty-seven patents , on telephones thirty-two patents , on electric lights a hundred and sixty-nine patents , and on ore-milling machinery fifty-three patents . When it is remembered that an incandescent lamp consists simply of a carbon filament in an exhausted glass globe , the ingenuity in devising one hundred and sixty-nine different patentable modifications and improvements on such device appears really marvellous . Queer inventions have been ascribed to Edison // from time to time , and the great electrician is of immense service to the imaginative American reporter who finds himself hard up for a " good story . " The conscienceless newspaper man will get hold of what he believes is a brilliant , if impracticable , idea , and which he knows would look well ( with a few nightmare illustrations ) in a Sunday newspaper , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really startling . It is necessary , however , to father the " story " on some scientist , and who better known than Edison ? So the unblushing space-writer couples with his imaginings the name of the great inventor , feeling pretty safe in the thought that his victim , like royalty , is far too busy to contradict all the wonderful statements which are published about him . Some time ago , for example , an American paper came out with a startling story of how Edison had conceived a plan whereby torpedo-boats would henceforth be rendered useless in times of war . " The apparatus , " said this sensation-loving journal , " is in the form of canisters of calcium carbide with a small quantity of calcium phosphide mixed in , to be placed in the scouting boats or fired into the water at a distance from a mortar . These canisters , being provided with buoyant chambers and water vents , would give off acetylene gas , and also spontaneously inflammable phosphoretted hydrogen , which would serve to ignite continuously the acetylene gas . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great numbers over an area of several square miles . Any torpedo-boat coming nearer than one mile of those lights would be thrown into silhouette , which , to the eye , would be at least fifty times more powerful than the small reflection from the lightabsorbing surface of a torpedo-boat illuminated by the most powerful electric light . This is Edison 's plan . i 99 THOMAS ALVA EDISON It simply cuts the torpedo-boat out of naval warfare as an important factor . " Many other queer inventions have been ascribed to Edison . At one time an enterprising newspaper , whose policy might be described as saffron-hued , for several months published an " interview " with the inventor weekly , ascribing to him such weird and wonderful things that he at last became really alarmed lest a lunacy commission should be appointed to inquire into his sanity . Something had to be done , and ? the editor of the paper in question received an intimation that unless the series of " stories " came to an end legal proceedings would be taken . Being a wise man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to law over the matter , and the series of " interviews " came to an abrupt conclusion . Among other strange inventions which this newspaper ascribed to Edison was one to be used for melting snow as rapidly as it fell . The work was to be accomplished by the use of electric and sunlight reflectors . " This , " said the newspaper in question , " will make many a city boy , who has to shovel snow from the sidewalk , very happy , but it will at the same time rob many a poor man of a meal that he would otherwise get for doing that work . The invention will have its greatest utility in clearing transcontinental railway tracks . " These " interviews " called forth an angry letter from the inventor in 1898 , addressed to a leading New York daily , of which the following is a copy : " SIR , -I wish to protest through the Sun against the many articles appearing in the sensational papers of New York from time to time purporting to be interviews with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by myself . Scarcely a SOME LESSER INVENTIONS 18q single one is authentic , and the statements purporting to be made by me are the inventions of the reporter . The public are led from these articles to draw conclusions just the opposite of the facts . I have never made it a practice to work on any line not purely practical and useful , and I. especially desire it to be known , if you will permit me , that I have nothing to do with an article advertised to appear in one of the papers about Mars . " T. A. EDISON . " But the story which , perhaps , caused Edison the greatest amount of annoyance was one published half a dozen years ago . " I laugh at it now , " said the inventor , " but at the time I did not think it quite so amusing . One of the boys ' ( newspaper men ) came down here one day , and not being able to see me or get any startling information from any of my associates , he went home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of his own invention . He declared , in a very lucid and descriptive way , that I was shortly bringing out a new and very ingenious shirt which would last the ordinary man twelve months or longer if he were economical . The front of the shirt , he declared , was made up of As eery thin layers of a certain fibrous material ? the composition of which was known only to the inventor ? and each morning that the wearer put the garment on , all he had to do to restore the front to its usual pristine spotlessness , was to tear off one of the layers , ' when he would have practically a new shirt . The writer declared that I myself wore these shirts , and that I considered the invention the biggest thing I had yet accomplished . Well , the story was published in about five hundred papers in the States , and
