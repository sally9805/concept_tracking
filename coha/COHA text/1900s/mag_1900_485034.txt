Their small but perfectly clear typography , their flexible covers , their quaint colored frontispieces , recommend them to all lovers of good taste as well as of Dickens . Mr Walter Jerrold furnishes an introduction to , each novel It would be impossible to add anything essential to what the younger Dickens has recorded bibliographically , but each edition requires something of the kind , end Mr. Jerrold 's discourse is all-sufficient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bookshelves Of fresher interest than the foregoing is the beginning of a Dent-Macmillan reprint of Vasari 's ' Lives of the Painters , Sculptors , end Architects ' ? " The Temple Vasari " This is an eminently wise selection for the series It will be extended to eight volumes , of which the first is to hand , equipped with a few notes at the end and some of the traditional portraits Finally , we may mention Mrs Gaskell 's ' Cranford ' in the same collection , with the author 's lovely face at the front . While on the subject of miniature editions , we must contrive a good word also for two series from John Lane  --  first , square , thin little reprints of Rossetti 's ' Blessed Damozel , ' with illustrations by Percy Bulcock , and of Browning 's ' The Statue and the Bust , ' illustrated by Philip Connard , who also furnishes the designs for Stephen Phillips 's ' Marpessa .

' We haVe seratinized none of these for the proof-reading , which , in the Temple Matthew Arnold , we remember to have left much to be desired . So , caveat emptor . Last of the kind to be instanced to-day is the Century Co. ' s ' flab and his Friends ' ( plus ' Our Dogs ' ) , by Dr. John Brown , with a portrait and an introduction by Andrew Lang , which for length was quite necessary to give thickness to the volume . Mr. Lang thinks Dr. Brown 's popularity to have been probably greater in this country than in his own . For wear and simple elegance we give the palm to the buff embossed binding of this American series .

Melville has always had the suffrages of the judicious ; the publishers , Dana Estes &; Co , now show a commendable courage in claiming for him the favor of the general public by reprinting his sea stories . The four volumes include , besides the two mentioned , ' Omoo ' and ' White Jacket . ' The publishers might perhaps have done better to rest the case for  - -   - -   Melville on ' Moby Dick ' and ' Typeee for the other books show more of his defects and fewer of his qualities . The volumes , which , with no distinction of mechanical form , are convenient and legible enough , are , we judge , reprinted from the plates of an edition of 1892 . Charles Scribner 's Sons send us the thirteenth revised edition of Baedeker 's ' Northern Germany ' and the twelfth of ' London and its Environs , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exactly fitted for the pocket , with convenient sectional plans of the metropolis . It is enough to announce the latest renovation of these standard guides . We can not put Mr. Guy Wetmore Carryl 's alliterative experiment with ' Mother Goose for Grown-Ups ' ( Harpers ) quite on a par with his ' Fables for the Frivolous . ' Coming first , it would abundantly have proved Mr. Carryl 's title to be an original humorist , but in parts , to use his own expression , we " note that the quality 's sometimes strained . " The " moral , " at least , is generally ingenious and mirth-provoking as heretofore . " Bow and hold your peace , " he says in " The Mysterious Misapprehension concerning a Man in our Town " , " Like Omar , underneath the bow You 'll find there 's paradise enow , " This particular " melody , " by the way , exhibits the carelessness in proof-reading which diminishes the book 's attractiveness . Peter Newell and Gustave Verbeek furnish the illustrations to Mr. Carryl 's nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting to the world and commenting upon every fragment that can reasonably be ascribed to the pen of Dickens . In ' The Minor Writings of Charles Dickens ' ( A. C Armstrong ) there is doubtless much information , especially with regard to rare editions , that will interest Dickens collectors . But the truth is , that Dickens wrote an amazing lot of worthless stuff by way of working off his superabundant energies It was the sawdust of his workshop . Every magazine or newspaper editor ( and Dickens was both ) has occasion to write much that he prefers to leave unclaimed . To wade through the entire set of nineteen volumes of Household Words in order to identify " the Chief 's " casual contributions , appears to us a very questionable labor of love . We have lately seen the same well-meaning attentions paid to the unsigned work of Thackeray . Even in his case , the results were not altogether happy , and Dickens is the last man to stand such a test . This is Mr. Kitton 's fourth volume on what we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices quoted in his bibliographies for first editions of the fugitive writings of Dickens would seem to indicate that his interest in the subject is shared by few . Under the title ' A Royal Rhetorician ' ( Brentano ) , Mr. R. S. Reit reprints , with an introduction and notes , some writings of James I. The Bishop of Winchester 's edition of King James 's works , published in 1616 , contains 600 pages , but Mr. Reit has drawn very moderately upon this enormous supply . The pieces which he selects are the ' Treatise on Scotts Poesie , ' the ' Counterblaste to Tobacco , ' a number of sonnets , and a few psalms Their intrinsic value is small , but they have a certain mterest , as showing how James 's singular mind worked , and how a man who was educated by George Buchanan used the Scottish and English tongues . Some readers may end a certain amount of amusement in glancing through the conclusion of the ' Counterblaste to Tobacco . ' " Have you not reason , then , to bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basely grounded , so foolishly received , and so grossely mistaken in the right use thereof ?

A custome loth-some to the eye , hatefull to the Nose , harmiull to the braine , dangerous to the Lungs , and in the black , stinking fume thereof , neerest resembling the horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse . " Of Mr. J. Robertson-Scott 's admirable dollar hand-book , ' The People of China : Their Country , History , Life , Ideas , and Relations to the Foreigner ' ( Methuen &; Co. ) , we must speak with praise , despite its limitations The author , a journalist , has never been in China , but has read well the literature of his subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information which an intelligent newspaper-reader would he likely to seek from a friend who had lived in the Far East .

From Confucius to Lord McCartney , Great Britain and China , and the General Scramble . To " The Chinaman " he gives four chapters , telling how he is governed and educated , and what are his characteristics and beliefs . Under the head of " The Foreign Devil , " he discusses the Jesus religion , opium , and the British sphere of influence . Glancing at the future , he shows China unconscious of decay , yet in the pangs of reform . An appendix gives some scanty biographical items concerning leading men in China , a short glossary , , a note on the best books eabout China , and a . good map .

They can not be praised for imagination or art , but the thick-and-thin admirer of the verse will be content with them . The principal contents of the Geographical Journal for October are Prof A. C. Haddon 's - account of the geographical distribution in British New Guinea of the various forms of houses , canoes , weapons , pottery , and decorative art , with numerous illustrations and maps , and Mr. Borchgrevink 's description of the SoutIbern Cross expedition to the Antarctic .

At the present time about 1,200 native pupils attend the Government schools , and gradually the Formosans are being induced to study the Japanese language .

The Consular Reports for October contains mention of the fiftieth annual convention of German sugar manufacturers at Magdeburg , at which Dr. Paasche presented a report upon the conditions of the sugar industry in this country and Cuba , the result of his observations during a recent visit made " solely for the purpose of ascertaining if dangers threaten the German sugar industry there . " He said , in substance , that " if Cuba regains its former productiveness , or , still worse , if it doubles its production , as some fear , the magnitude of the disaster which will result in the world 's markets can not be overestimated .

There is further noted the discovery of extensive diamond diggings in the interior of British Guiana . Large numbers of gems have ' been taken to London , where they have been pronounced superior to the South African and equal in quality to the Brazilian stones . The Geological Survey " of New South Wales has published , as No. 8 of the ' Mineral Resources " series , a report on the Hillgrove gold-field , by E. C. Andrews . It treats of one of the most important goldfields discovered in recent years in that colony , and is of special interest on account of the occurrence there of lodes containing ores of antimony and tungsten associated with gold . The scheehte deposits are also of considerable importance . The pamphlet is fully illustrated , and contains a map of the region described .

This part closes with " invalid " ( substantive ) , of which the common English stress is upon the last syllable , whereas the American is upon the first ; yet our practice obtains occasionally in England in the corresponding adjective use ( e. g. , " an invalid sister " ) American and New England is " interval , " with a single example from Lithgow antedating the earliest citation on this side of the water Here began " interview " and " interviewer " in the newspaper sense , for which Dr. Murray has procured no earlier citation than those from the Nation in 1869 We may add that as late as May 16 , 1878 , the word " interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if it had not obtained a respectable footing . The thing has never obtained that , so far as Dr. Murray 's extracts can be taken as proof . The once respectable ( if " peculiar " ) " institution " of slavery has its landmark here in a passage from Thackeray ( 1860 ) , who professed himself no advocate of it . From the French we have adapted " intransigent " ( 1883 ) , " intern " and " interned " ( 1866 ) , from the Dutch of Cape Colony " inspan " ( 1852 ) , to ' yoke ' or ' harness up . ' " Interlope " has a curious history , and somewhat obscure . It turns up at the end of the sixteenth century , and fully a hundred years elapse before any cognate appears in neighboring tongues . It captivated the French for its convenience , and the Dutch almost took their own as they refound it " Interloper , " on the other hand , arose as an independent formation with a special meaning of ' vagabond ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dictionary , and its original French form of entre is preserved only in " entertain " and " enterprise . " " Interest " grew out of " interess " after the French , in a manner not clear ; and " interesting , " in the modern sense , is no older than 1768 , and so falls in the lifetime of the grandfather of many a man now witnessing the expiration of the century . How we got along without the latter ' word before that date , passes comprehension , since it has no close synonym and has become a perplexing banality . We observe that Dr. Murray gives no example of the coupling of " interesting and instructive , " another odious commonplace hard to avoid . The phrazth " for instance " emerges in 1657 . While " insight " has taken solid hold of the vocabulary , " insee " is obsolete and rare . " Insense , " to " inform , " can be neatly rendered by the Sea islands locution , ' to make sensiaa/e of ' Coleridge 's apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that word ; and this author 's " insupportably advancing , " in his Ode to France , would , if appended to Milton 's " insupportably his foot advanc't , " have shown the echoer . We close these desultory comments with the remark that our football slang of " interference " has not been apprehended  --  perhaps not apprehensible  --  for the Oxford Dictionary . ? It is a pity that the passion for - bookmaking seems to have seized upon Mr. Ar chibald Colquhoun . But for some weakness of that kind , all that is new and essential in his ' Russia against India ; The Struggle for Asia ' ( Harpers ) might easily have been put in a magazine article . Three chapters ( pp. 55-125 ) , descriptive of central Asia and its peoples , are absolute padding , two chapters ( pp. 1-54 ) , descriptive of the Russian advance in Asia , are practically stolen by Mr Colquhoun from himself elsewhere ; it is only with page 126 and a consideration of the loyalty of the people of India that the book really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dangers that lie in bureaucratic rule  --  over-taxation , and the tyrmany of money-lenders  --  generally the problem of the government of an Oriental people on Western methods , however just and well intended they may be  --  are well brought out . Then comes the thesis that Russia 's objective is India ; that India can not be defended ill , India , but that the frontier must run from Herat to Faizabad , the fighting line being from Kabul to Kandahar , which is coming to be recognized ; that the Persian Gulf must be held absolutely , and a railway constructed as quickly as possible through Baluchistan and southern Persia to join the German line at Bagdad , and run across northern Arabia to Egypt , which will certainly come in time . But all this means practically the occupation and garrisoning of Afghanistan , an expense which India can not possibly bear . So it must be reckoned as imperial expenditure and borne by the Empire .

If the fate of India may be decided by a fight in the English Channel , the fate of England may lie in a battle on the Helmund or Indus . Mr. Colquhoun 's book is timely , then .

The map , it may be noticed , is hardly up to even recent history . In it Chitral , Yasin , and Nagar still fall outside British territory . ? The ' Memoirs of the Countess Potocka ( Doubleday &; McClure ) is an autobiography which remained unpublished for thirty years after the death of its author in 1867 , and was then edited by another Pole , Casimir Stryienski . Editors take such liberties that one always likes to know upon what plan a given editor has proceeded . No explanation is offered by translator or publisher of how M. Stryienski " arranged the ' Memoirs ' for publication , " and a page in facsimile of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveys little idea of the editor 's methods . Still , the text raises no inevitable doubts . Whatever may have been kept back , the published part seems to come directly from the Countess . The memoirs are not a complete record , for they break off at 1820 , and the author lived on at Paris until the closing years of the Second Empire . This Countess Potocka , who should not be confounded with the more celebrated Helene Massalski Potocka , belonged to the family Tyszkiewicz , and was closely allied with that of Poniatowski The writer of the present book was a great-granddaughter of Stanislaus Poniatowski , the companion of Charles XII . of Sweden , and the grandniece of Stanislaus Augustus , the last King of Poland . Accordingly , she belonged to the highest ranks 04 the Polish nobility , and hated Snvaroff only less than she did the Russian Government . The Countess describes a visit to Paris in 1810 very fully ; otherwise , the action centres in Poland .

The rank of the Countess Potocka brought her the acquaintance of the French and Russian aristocracy , but did not altogether protect her from insult She had the liveliness of the Polish nobles , and she knew how to communicate it to her memoirs . A passage describing her girlish Views about marriage well show the general quality of her style " My mind and heart were , I can not say exactly how , swelled with a sort of juvenile exaltation , nourished by the perusal of the great poets whom it had been impossible to keep from me I wanted heroes like Racine 's , or knights like Tancred Mighty passions were my need , instantaneous affections , great and sublime deeds !

" ? Hoepli of Milan has undertaken to produce , in a series of volumes , a history of Italy which shall be scientific in spirit while popular in form The task is not an easy one , for nowhere else is to be found so complicated and multitudinous a series of events , resulting from so many diverse forces working through the evolution of antagonistic institutions If the enterprise is carried to a successful issue , it will prove most serviceable , for as yet the reader may look in vain for a comprehensive and intelligible account of the vicissitudes through which Italy has passed since the fall of Rome , and of the influences which have made it what it is and have enabled it to impress itself so profoundly on the development of European civilization .

It is a story which can never lose its interest , for that revolution has made us what we are , and its consequences are still operative in our daily lives . LIFE OF FRANCIS PARKMAN A Life of Prawns Parlonan By Charles Haight Farnham . Boston : Little , Brown &; There is perhaps no American author whose character and career so test the skill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a satisfaction to say at the outset that Mr Farnham has accomplished , in his mode of meeting this test , a rather remarkable piece of literary work There is something unique about the whole rersonality and fame of the author whom he commemorates Surrounded by a group of historians to whom reputation had come easily , though not undeservedly , he long preserved an isolation alike of theme and fame  --  or want of fame . At a time when Prescott , Bancroft , Motley were as well known in England as in America , one might speak of Parkman among London literary men and find no one who had even heard of him . This was due in part to the fact that he was a specialist , and this in a direction little cultivated in English circles , and partly to the proud , shy , reticent nature of the man , these qualities being farther intensified by a career of heroic stoicism under enormous physical drawbacks In his own country , while his books were better known than in England , the man was not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of Boston , he always kept himself aloof , and never seemed less appropriately placed than when he consented to be for a time the president of a semi-literary , semi-social club , not that he did not do his official duties faithfully , but that he had not that spirit of constitutional and miscellaneous fellowship which is quite essential in a club leader His later years , moreover , even after his fame was established , were saddened by those clouds so apt to gather around the temperament of a conservative growing old amid a community whose instinctive movements are in an opposite direction from his When we add that , in his biographer 's discriminating words , " he often wished to free himself from some of the most fundamental inherited forces of his character " ( p 8 ) , we have a combination troublesome in youth and Peculiarly exasperating in age . Parkman said of himself that he had " no natural inclinations " for historical research , and found it " abundantly irksome and laborious " ( p. 153 ) He would hardly , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , he lived one of the most absolutely heroic and self-denying lives of our generation Even in his literary opinions he was almost reactionary , and always held Pope and Byron to be superior to Wordsworth , whom he disliked , his biographer tells us , both " as poet and man " ( p 347 ) . Emerson is not mentioned in the book , and Parkman seems to have been scarcely influenced by Parker , with whom he had travelled and whose admirable letter criticising ' Pontiac ' is appended to this book . Parkman " felt repelled " by what he considered Thoreau 's " affectation of being natural " ( p. 196 ) His personal preferences beyond the circle of authors were equally decided and perhaps limited He thought Lincoln " generally overrated , " and indebted more to circumstances than to inherent ability ; had little admiration for Garrison or Phillips , and considered Sumner " deficient in courage and manliness " ( p 278 ) ? Sumner , whose triumphant conquest over physical obstacles approached nearer than any other to Park-man 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including woman suffrage , was " an undoubted aristocrat in politics " ( p. 270 ) , called the working classes " the barbarians of civilization " ( p 267 ) , but never succeeded in developing any plan for restricted suffrage that would satisfy even himself . All these qualities are admirably analyzed by Mr Farnham , and those who worked side by side with Parkman for many years will be surprised to find how well he is now delineated by one who knew him comparatively little The book abounds in sentences as trenchant as Parkman 's own , and far more judicial " He opposed himself so bluntly and broadly to all philanthropic reforms and their advocates as almost to appear indifferent to the welfare of the race " " Few men of equal eminence ever had so little personal or intellectual contact with the liberal leaders of their time . " " His own asperity was hateful to him , but he could not cut loose from that side of his nature " " Helped by the warmth of personal contact and friendship , we find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of this humane influence , he was neither charitable nor generous " ( p. 295 ) . It is interesting to learn from this biography that Parkman 's sister described him as a " reverent Agnostic " ( p 312 ) , and lies daughter , Mrs J. T. Coolidge , as " a passionate Puritan " In speaking of literary work , Mr. Farnham shows much the same judicial quality . Park-man , as he points out , had a distinct aversion for the professed littdi steer ( p. 201 ) , and yet he himself , although trained under the most judicious critic of his time , Prof Edward T. Channing , began with an extremely florid style in his ' Pontiac . ' His illustrations at this period were not merely florid , but tamely so , his descriptions and observations were fresh and vigorous , while his images and illustrations were apt to be commonplace . Theodore Parker makes this criticism yet more strongly in comparing the style to that of J. T Headley ( p. 376 ) . Parkman was as much a votary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all imaginative sympathy with the nature of the Amencan Indian . The whole world unrolled by the closer researches of such later explorers as Alice Fletcher and Lucien Carr was veiled from Parkman during his period of constructive work , although the Pueblo Indians latterly interested him ; and it is perfectly true , as his biographer points out , that he did more than any one to enlarge the Merely classical themes which at first absorbed and came near to monopolizing the- American Arche=ological Institute . It was the opinion of the late Justin Winsor that this limitation , if there were no other , would impair the permanence of Park-man 's fame , and he deprecated those comparisons with Gibbon into which Mr Fiske and others have been too rashly tempted But no one will ever question Mr. Farnham 's conclusion " In his patient fortitude under suffering , in his persistent industry despite the greatest obstacles , and in his fidelity to his ideals , Parkman was certainly one of the most heroic figures in the history of letters "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
