txt Following- a luncheon conference between Attorney General Mayer , District Attorney Jerome , Samuel Untermyer , counsel for James H. Hyde , and Edward Lauterbach of the Alexander counsel at a down-town restaurant yesterday the programme of the State authorities in the Equitable Life Assurance matter became pretty definitely known . By the first or middle of next week the Attorney General will be in a position to institute suits of various kinds , and , according to authoritative infdrmation , the actions will I be started without delay . These suits , it is said , will come under two general classes . ' In the first may. , be placed a blanket action against all , or nearly all , the Directors of the Equitable Society who served during the time Coy'ered by the investigations of the State Insurance Superintendent , charging waste of the society 's funds and neglect of duty . ' This action can have the widest . sort of I scope and can go into any of the allegetions made in the Equitable controversY , on the ground taken by Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Directors of the Equitable Society are responsible for whatever mismanagement has existed . The second class will be the actions naming individuals against whom specific charges of malfeasance are believed to lie . These may be either for the recovery ' of money improperly obtained through the Equitable Society or for the disqualification of such Directors as are deemed to or Director will be picked out for the first defendant , but that the actions , will be started as nearly simultaneously as possible . After the conference it was learned that the Attorney General asked Mr. Unter- , Myer , who sails for Europe this morning , 1 to be gone until the middle of September , whether service of papers in any action in which Mr. Hyde was involved would be accepted in his absence . Mr. Linter- I myer replied that his office would accept the service of any papers , and that it was , Mr. Hyde 's desire and intention to expedite any action to the fullest extent .. Mr : Colby of Alexander ** will accept the papers in it** ifctiOri against PresidentAlexander. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inais ' be said ' ' ' definitely , has , Only ' ' , Just ' begun , . and no line of procedure has . been- determined by him , as he got the testimony taken by Mr. Hendricks yesterday afternoon . Mr. Jerome earlier In the day made a trip . to the Equitable Building , but as far as could be learned he did not visit any of the officers of the society . As he was leaving the building he . said : " I 've just been taking a look around . You know I get down around this district , pretty frequently nowadays . " Chairman Paul ' Morton of the Equitable 's Board of Directors , when asked yesterday how his own investigation was going on , said : Our housecleaning is going on vigorously every day . The accountants are going through the books with great thoroughness , and by the time they get through there wo n't be . anything about this society that we do n't know . " " Are you going to turn over the results of y6ur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he was asked . " That depends upo1 what the results are , " Mr. Morton replied , and then added : " I shall probably continue to have announcements to make from time to time . " Mr. Morton said that no meeting of the Directors of the society had been called for the near future , and that the call for such a meeting would wait upon the convenience of the Trustees . The Trustees , Grover Cleveland , Morgan J. O'Brien , and George Westinghouse , are again in sea1 sion at the Hotel Buckingham , discussing the names of candidates for the vacancies in the board , and they Win probably be so engaged here for a day or two more before a list is made up to be submitted to the board . It is not unlikely , therefore . that a Directors ' meeting will be called the latter part of this week or the first of next to receive the nominations . Following the resignation of Agent Archibald C. Haynes . who , it Was learned yesterday , had already resigned twice ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and returned after a short time in the other case , it was reported that the resignation of . Senator Depew was a possibility . It was learned that the Trustees have received several letters from policy holders asking that Senator Depew 's name be dropped from the board , , and an official of the Equitable Society was authority for the assertion that a request for the . Senator 's resignation was within the range of probabilities . Senator Depew is in Europe .. He sailed about a week before Paul Morton cut off the retainer of $20,000 a year that the Senator had been receiving for many ' years .
