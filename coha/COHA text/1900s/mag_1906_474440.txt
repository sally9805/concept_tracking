IT was in November , 1861 , that four police officers were detailed by Mr. William B. Webb , who was then chief of police in the District of Columbia , to be a special guard for President Lincoln . They were to act on instructions from headquarters , and were also to be subject to any orders the President might give . The men were Elphonso Dunn , John Parker , Alexander Smith , and Thomas Pendel . All but Thomas Pendel have since died . They reported immediately to the White House . Not long after the appointment a vacancy in the position of doorkeeper occurred , and the place was given to Pendel . On the 4th of January I was sent to the White House to act as the fourth guard . There was rotation in the service , although the hours were not invariable . The general plan was this : ' Iwo men were on duty from eight in the morning to four in the afternoon . These officers guarded the approach to the President in his office or elsewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , stood between him and possible danger . At four another man went on duty and remained until midnight , or Inter if Mr. Lincoln had gone outside the White House and lied not returned by that time . At twelve the second night-guard went on duty , and remained until lie was relieved , at eight in the morning . The night-guards were expeeted to protect the ' President on his expeditions to and from the War Department or while he was at any place of amusement , and to patrol the corridor outside his room while he slept . We were all armed with revolvers . The reasons why the friends of Mr. Lincoln insisted on this precaution were almost as evident then as they became later . Marshal Ward Lannon and Secretary Stanton had been begging him , it VOL . CXiV. ? No. 6 ; .1. - 15is said , since 1862 not to go abroad with-cut protection of some kind . Mr. Limon has said himself that he was especially fearful of the President 's showing himself at the theatre . He considered that a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable than Mr. Lincoln 's solitary walks or the occasional drive or horseback ride he took to the Soldiers ' Home . Mr. Stanton is known to have been angered by a leek of caution which , on the part of a man so indispensable to the welfare of the nation as its President , he regarded as foolhardiness . For the President had always been inclined , in his interest in the thing that absorbed him , to forget that he was vulnerable . Every one remembers how , when he was watching Early 's threatened attack on the fortifications north of Washington , he exposed himself recklessly to chance bullets . He hated being on his guard , and the fact that it was necessary to distrust his fellow Americans saddened him . He refused to be guarded as long as it was possible for a sane man to persist . But toward the end of 1864 so much pressure was brought to bear on him , particularly by Marshal Limon and Secretary Stanton , that he finally yielded . He had admitted to Ward . Lemon before this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garowski , who had been seen skulking about the White House grounds . He told Lemon of a shot that had barely missed hint one day when he was riding to the Soldiers ' Home . Conspiracies to abduct or assassinate the President were constantly being rumored . At first he contended that if any one wanted to murder him no precaution would avail . Finally , although he was always more or less of this opinion , the President gave way to the anxieties of those near to him . He consented In the guard of police officers and , on longer journeys , to a cavalry guard . There were ninny reasons why this fact was not known at the time and has not been generally understood since . In the first place , the President 's bravery ? rashness some called it ? was so universally recognized , he had refused for so long to take any precautions , that people were not looking for him to change . In the second place , both from his own feelings and as a matter of policy , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found necessary to guard the life of the President of the ' United States from assassination . It was not wise ? especially at this critical time ? to admit so great a lack of confidence in the people . He was sensitive about it , too . It hurt him to admit it . But realizing that he had been chosen to save the country from threatened destruction , he forced himself , ( luring the last months of his life , to be somewhat more cautious . When he had yielded , however , because of all these reasons he wished as little show as possible of precaution . We wore citizen 's clothes ; there was no mention of the appointment in the papers or in official records ; we - walked with him , not behind him . The President was simple in his manners ; he was in the habit of talking freely with any one who wished to speak to him . So it happened that a passerby had no way of knowing that the man in plain clothes who walked by Mr. Lincoln 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petitioner , adviser , who helped to fill up every minute of the President 's waking time . I was very much surprised when the order came to report to the President for duty and naturally elated . It was me Monday morning . I had never been inside the White House . I had seen Mr. Lincoln and regarded him vaguely as a great man , but had never spoken to him . The first few days I was getting my bearings and accustoming myself to the new duties . On the 9th I was put on night duty , covering the first part of the night . And so it happened that I was on guard at the first evening reception of the year , un the 9th of January . I knew the White House very well by this time -- that is , the state apartments of the first floor and the President 's office in the southeast corner tip-stairs . The spectacle awed me at firsi . I had never seen anything like it before . The reception , or " levee , " as the name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant affair . I know it dazzled me . The President and Mrs. Lincoln stood in the octagon Blue Room , near the western door . T was in the main entrance just outside , near where the broad flight of steps used to go up to the second floor . The guests entered the northern door , left their wraps in the cloak-rooms which had been constructed in the corridor , assembled in the Red Room , made their way to the Blue Room , where they were received . Then they progressed , greeting friends in the crowd , through the Green Room to the great Enst Room , where they remained . On the right of the President was Mr. John G. Nieolay , one of the two secretaries ; on his left Deputy-Marshal Phillips . Commissioner French presented the guests to Mrs. Lincoln . I suppose I could hardly be expected to remember what the ladies wore . But my wife saw in the papier the next day that Mrs. Lincoln wore white silk trimmed with black lace . She had a wreath of white flowers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose the costume , hoop-skirts and all , would look ugly to me to-day . But we all thought Mrs. ' Lincoln looked handsome . To my mind she was a pretty woman , small and plump , with a round baby face and bright black eyes . Senator Sumner was present and Senator Chase with a party . That reminds me of what was to me the most exciting moment of the reception . My orders were to allow no one who wore wraps of any kind to pass into the Blue Room . The reason for this is not hard to find . Precautions were being redoubled , and this was one of them . It would be the easiest thing in the world for a would - be assassin to smuggle weapons in under the voluminous cloaks then worn . It had been announced that guests were expected to leave their wraps in one of the rooms appointed for them . I had been instructed to make absolutely no exceptions . The newspaper the next day said , " The rule of decorum relating to wraps was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit-tie experience . Several guests had attempted to enter still wearing their cloaks . But no our resisted the order when it was made known . Finally a very handsome young woman came in who asked for Senator Chase 's party . She wore a wrap that completely hid her dress . She could have brought in a whole arsenal of weapons under its folds . I told her that she could not enter until she left her cloak in the cloak-room . She became angry . " Do you know who I am ? " she demanded , haughtily . I was rather nervous , for it was my first experience saying " Must not ! " to White House guests . But I. managed to say I did not know who she was . " I am Mrs. Senator Sprague , " she announced , as if that were final . T had heard of Kate Chase Sprague , of course , as had every one else in Washington , and of her father 's ambition and her own brilliant career . But I tried to be courageous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders were and why they were given . When she saw the mason of the restriction she took off her cloak and went in to meet her friends quite graciously . By this time most of the guests had arrived , so I had an opportunity to look about me . It was all bright and gay . For this evening at least there was no sign of the gloom that was pretty general throughout the city . The people who crowded the rooms were in keeping with their brilliant character . The men were marked by a shade of extravagance in the cut and material of their evening clothes . There were many army officers in full uniform among the guests . The women looked like gorgeous flowers in their swaying buoyed - out skirts . They were gayly dressed , as a rule , with the off-shoulder style of low-necked gown ; they all wore wreaths of flowers in their hair . The general effect of the scene was brilliant . About eleven the President with ; Sirs . Dennison , the wife of the new Postmaster-General , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan , entered the Fast Room . They talked for n few minutes with their guests and then retired ? Mrs. Lincoln to her own room and the President to the library up-stairs . The levee was supposed to be over at eleven , but some people remained until nearly twelve . After they had all left , Mr. Lincoln wrapped himself in the rough gray shawl he usually wore out-of-doors , put on his tall bearer hat , and slipped out of the White . House through the basement . According to my orders I followed him , and was alone with President Lincoln for the first time . We crossed the garden , which lay where the executive offices are now . Mr. Lincoln was bent on his nightly visit to Secretary Stanton at the War Department . I stole a glance up at him , at the homely face rising so far above me . The strength of it is not lessened in my memory by what would seem to in now the grotesque setting of rough shawl and silk hat . He looked to me just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was nervous when I accompanied him that first time . I hope it was not from any fear for myself . I seemed to realize suddenly that there was only myself between this man and possible danger . The feeling wore off in time , thot.gla it was apt to come back at any moment of special responsibility , as , for instance , on the entrance into Richmond ? but I must n't get ahead of my story . That night , as I said , I was a little nervous . The President noticed it . He seemed to know how I felt , too . I had fallen into line behind him , but he motioned me to walk by his side . He began to talk to me in a kindly way , as though I were a bashful boy whom he wanted to put at his ease , instead of a man appointed to guard him . In part , of course , his motive must have been the dislike of seeming to be guarded , of which I have spoken . But his manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which I afterward saw so many instances . It was shown particularly toward those who were subordinate to him . The statesmen who came to consult him , those who had it in their power to influence the policy of the party which lind chosen him , never had the consideration from Mr. Lincoln that he gave the humblest of those who served him . A few strides of the President 's long /cgs ? a few more of mine ? brought us to the old-fashioned turnstile that divided the White House grounds from the enclosure of the War Department . Mr. Lincoln talked , in his slow soft voice , chiefly about the reception through which he had just gone . " I am glad it is over , " he said . I ventured to ask if he was tired . " Yes , it does tire use to shake hands with so many people , " he answered . " Especiall , y now when there is so much other work to do . And most of the guests come out of mere curiosity . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east door of the War Department , lu those days that was a small , mean , two-story building , just in front of the Navy Department . We went immediately to Mr. Stanton 's office , which was on the second floor , on the north front , and overlooked Pennsylvania Avenue and the White House . There , at the door , I waited for him until his conference with Secretary Stanton was over . Then I accompanied him back to the White House . From the moment Mr. Lincoln spoke to me so kindly I felt at home in my new duties . I never lost the feeling which came then that while the President was so great , he was my friend . The White House never awed me again . For the next three weeks , while I was on duty the first half of the night , I went to the War Department with Mr. Lincoln every evening . He usually talked to sue . Several times the topic was the one my presence naturally suggested ? the possibility of an attempt being made on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in detail . One time while he was talking he reached out and took my hand , and I walked on for a few paces with my hand in his warm , kind grasp . We always took the same route because there was less chance of being observed than if we went by the big north entrance . There was no telegraph station in the White House , so the President had to go to Secretary Stanton 's office to get the latest news from the front . Since there was practical advantage in going himself , as he could be MOTO free from interruption there when lie remained to discuss matters of policy ? if the news of the night necessitatedany action ? it would never have occurred to Mr. Lincoln to regard his own personal dignity and wait for his Secretary to come to him . I had opportunity to observe the difference in the attitude of Secretary Stanton 's employees from ours toward the President . The great War Secretary was a martinet for discipline . And none of the clerks wanted to be around when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to sue a very bitter , cruel man . Still , there is no doubt that he was a great man . His own subordinates , though they might be afraid of his irascible temper , admired him and were loyal . Beginning with the 1st of February , I was on duty the second half of the night , from twelve to eight in the morning . Often I had to wait for the President to return from the War Department ; even when he came back comparatively early it was midnight before he get to bed . His bedroom was a small chamber in the southwest corner of the house . Mrs. Lincoln 's was a larger room adjoining it . Mr. Lincoln always said , " Good night , Crook , " when he passed me on his way to his room , but gave no instructions for my guidance . He was not interrupted after he retired unless there were important telegrams . Even when awakened suddenly from a deep sleep ? which is the most searching test of one 's temper that I know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messenger kindly . No employee of the White House ever saw the President moved beyond his usual controlled calm , When the first of these interruptions occurred and I had to enter the President 's room ; I looked around me with a good deal of interest . The place the President slept in was a noteworthy-spot to me . It was handsomely furnished ; the bedstead , bureau , and washstand were of heavy mahogany , the bureau and wash-stand with marble tops ; the chairs were of rosewood . Like all the other chambers , it was covered with a carpet . Al ! night . I walked up and down the long corridor which , running east and west , divided the second story of tho White House in half . Usually the household , with the exception of Mr. Lincoln , was asleep when I began my watch . Oceasionally , however , something kept them up , and I saw them go to their rooms . I learned very soon who slept behind each door that 1 passed in my patrol . Somehow one feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides the doorkeeper. awake in a great house and is responsible for the safety of them all . As I said before , the corridor divided the private apartments of the White House into two long rows , one facing south , the other north . Beginning at the west was the President 's room , Mrs. Lincoln 's just east of it and communicating . Then followed a guest-room , which communicated with Mrs. Lincoln 's . Next to this was the library , just over the Blue Room , and , like it , an octagon in shape ; this was used as the family sitting-room . In Mr. Lincoln 's time a private passageway ran through the reception-room adjoining the library to the President 's office beyond . By this the President could have access during his long working-day to his own apartments without being seen by the strangers who always filled the reception-room . The small room in the southeast corner was the office of Mr. Lincoln 's secretaries ? Mr. Hay and Mr. Nicolay . On the other side of the corridor Mr. Nicolay , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the eastern end . Next to his was the state guest-room , which , unlike any ether room in the house , possessed a large four-poster bed with a tester and rich canopy . Between this and Taddie 's room ? Taddie was the only child at the White House at this time ? three smaller rooms and a bath-room intervened . The boy was just opposite his father . When in my patrol I came near to the door of the President 's room I could hear his deep breathing . Sometimes , after a day of unusual anxiety , I have heard him moan in his sleep . It gave me a curious sensation . While the expression of Mr. Lincoln 's face was always sad when he was quiet , it gave one the assurance of calm . He never seemed to doubt the wisdom of an action when be had once decided on it . And so when lie was in a way defenceless in his sleep it made me feel the pity that would have been almost an impertinence when he was awake . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole over me . If he felt the weight of things so heavily , how much worse the situation of the country must be than any of us realized ! At oat I would walk softly away , feeling as if I had been listening at a keyhole . On the 15th of February I went on day ditty . During that time I necessarily saw more of the every-day life of the President and his family . Everything was much simpler than it is now . More of the family life was open to the scrutiny of the people about . I remember very well one incident which would have been impossible at any time since . I was sent for by the President , who was in his own room . In response to my knock he called out , " Come in l " 1 entered . To my great surprise I saw that he was struggling with a needle and thread . He was sewing a button on his trousers . " All right , " lie said , looking at me with a twinkle in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Lincoln , as I saw him every morning , in the carpet slippers he wore in the house cud the black clothes no tailor could make really fit his gaunt bony frame , was a homely enough figure . The routine of his life was simple , too ; it would have seemed a treadmill to most of us . He was an early riser ; when I came on duty , at eight in the morning , he was often already dressed and reading in the library . There was a big table near the centre of the room ; there I have seen him reading many times . And the book ? We have all beard of the President 's fondness for Shakespeare , how he infuriated Secretary Stanton by reading Hamlet while they were waiting for returns from Gettysburg ; we know , too , how he kept cabinet meetings waiting while he read them the latest of Petroleum V. Nasby 's witticisms . It was the Bible which I saw him reading while most of the household still slept . Alta and Mrs. Lincoln breakfasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never lost his taste for the things a growing farmer 's boy would like . He was particularly fond of bacon . Plentiful and wholesome food was one of the means by which he kept up his strength , which was taxed almost beyond endurance in those days . Even hostile newspapers commented angrily on the strain to which the President was subjected , and prophesied that he would collapse unless some of the pressure of business was removed . But in spite of his gauntness he was a man of great physical endurance . Every inch of his six feet four inches was seasoned and tempered force . He needed all of it . For from half past nine , when he came into his office , until twelve , when he went to bed , his work went on , almost without cessation . Ile had very little outdoor life . An occasional drive with Mrs. Lincoln in the afternoon , a more occasional horseback ride , a few moments to fill his lungs with outside air while he walked the few paces to the War Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should have some recreation . I have carried messages to him for her when he was lingering in his office , held by some business . One beautiful afternoon she sent for him so many times that she became impatient and told me to tell him that he must come . He got up with an expression of great submission and said , " I guess I would better go . " The friends who were with him teased him a little about Mrs. Lincoln 's show of authority . " If you knew how little harm it does me , " be said , " and how much good it does her , you would n't wonder that I am meek . " And he went out laughing . The White House and its surroundings during war-time had much the appearance of a Southern plantation ? straggling and easy-going . On the east side of the house beyond the extension ? since removed ? which corresponded to the conservatory on the west , was a row of outhouses , a carriage-house and a woodshed among them . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's two horses were kept . South of the house was a short stretch of lawn hounded by a high iron fence . Still beyond was rough undergrowth and marsh to the river . In front and to the west was a garden , divided from the rest of the grounds by tall fences . It was a real country garden , with peach-trees and strawberry-vines as well as flowers . It was winter , of course , when I was there , but the people about the housetold me that Mrs. Lincoln used to pick the strawberries for the table herself . I saw a good deal of Mrs. Lincoln while I was on day duty . Very few who were not about the house realized how exacting were the duties of her position . She was , of course , much absorbed by social duties , which presented difficulties uo other President 's wife has bad to contend against . The house was filled , the receptions were crowded , with all sorts of people , of all varieties of political conviction , who felt , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect right to take up the President 's time with their discourse and to demand of Mrs. Lincoln social consideration . Nor could there be discrimination used at the state dinner-parties ; any man who was bearing a part in the events of the day must be invited ? and his women folks . , lint Lane , rough old Kansas lighter , dined beside Salmon P. Chase with his patrician instincts . The White House has never , during my forty years ' service , been so entirely given over to the public as during Mr. Lincoln 's sdministration . The times were too anxious to make of social affairs anything more than an aid to more serious matters . It was necessary , of course ; but it Inside it difficult for a first-lady-in-theland with any preferences or prejudices not to make enemies on every hand . Mrs. Lincoln had to give some time to household affairs . Everything was comparatively simple at that time ; there were fewer servants than have been ' considered necessary since . The first duty of Mrs. Lincoln 's day was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cook was an old-time negro woman . A good deal of domestic supervision was necessary with the mistress of the house . For state dinners the regular stall was entirely inadequate ; a French caterer was called in , who furnished everything , including waiters . It fell to Mrs. Lincoln to choose the set of china which the White House needed at this stage . It was , in my opinion , the handsomest that has ever been used there . In the centre was an eagle surrounded by clouds ; the rim was a solid band of maroon . The coloring was soft and pretty , and the design patriotic . The President 's wife found time , too , to inyestigate cases of need that were brought to her attention , and to help . I know of such cases . She was kind to all the employees of the White House . I think she was very generally liked . Robert Lincoln was an officer on General Grant 's staff , and was in Washington only at inauguration time and for a few days at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manly , genial young fellow , and we all liked him . Taddie ? he was christened Thomas ? was the pet of the whole household . He was ten years old at the time . I wish 1 could show what a capital little fellow he was . I think I will have to take a few minutes to talk of Taddie . Since the death of the older boy , Willie , which almost broke his father 's heart , Mr. Lincoln had kept Tad with him almost constantly . When lie had a few minutes to spare he would make a child of himself to play with the boy . We all liked to see the President romp up and down the corridors with Tad , playing horse , turn and turn about , or blind man 's huff . Mr. ' Lincoln was such a sadlooking TIM ) usually , it seemed good to have him happy . And he was happy when he was playing with the boy . I am sure the times when he was really resting were when he was galloping around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President was too busy to play with him , Tad would play quietly , near as he could get , making a man of himself to be company to his father . That was the sort of a little fellow he was . He was a tender-hearted boy . Of course all sorts of people found it out and tried to get at the President through him . Mr. Lincoln was criticised sometimes for being too lenient when the boy begged for some one he had been asked to help . But I do n't believe mercy was a bad thing to be overdone in those days . Tad 's loving heart was just the same thing that made the President suffer so alien he had to be severe . The boy was like his father ; he looked like him . But with Tad there was no realization of anything else to confuse him . And when Mr. Lincoln was what some people called too indulgent he was just listening to what I believe was the greatest . thing in him ? his great human heart . And Ido n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . I remember one poor woman who came to the White House to get her husband out of prison . She found Taddie in the corridor and told him that her boys and girls were cold and starving because their father was shut up and could n't work for them . Poor little Taddie could n't wait a minute . - He ran to his father end begged him to have the man set free . The President was busy with some important papers and told him , rather absent-mindedly , that he would look into the case ae soon as lie had time . But Tad was thinking of the woman , and he clung to his father 's knees and begged until the President had to listen , and , listening , became interested . So , after all , Taddie could run back to tell the woman that her husband would be set at liberty . I wish you could have seen the child 's face . The woman blessed him and cried , and Taddie cried , and I am not sure that my own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the men who were about the White House in various capacities . I myself have a letter from him written from Chicago in July , 1365 , a few months after the family had left the White House . It was writteu for Tad by Mrs. Lincoln , and the business part of it ? I had asked if there would be a good opening for me in Chicago ? was her own , of course . But the rest is all Toddle : Ness . Ctoonna /Idly Mai .

All news will interest us . Your friend truly TADDIE . " Charlie " was Charles Forbes , an Irishman . He was the footman and one of Tad 's friends . " Dana " Pendel was Thomas Pendel , the doorkeeper , of whom Taddie was also very fond . James Haliday was another friend . He was a carpenter who worked about the place , and was directed by the President to put up a stage and arrange things for theatrical performances in the little room just over the entrance . That was when Tad was stage-struck and found it necessary to endow a theatre of his own . Perry Kelly ? a boy of about Tad 's age , whose father was a tinner on Pennsylvania Avenue between Seventeenth and Eighteenth streets ? was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly of the employees of the place . Haliday , who is living now in Boston , was also a member of Tad 's military company . Like all other boys of those exciting times , Tad had the military lever But he was allowed to gratify it in a way not open to other boys . The Secretary of War gave him a lieutenant 's commission and an order on the arsenal for twenty-five guns ; a pretty uniform was made for him . The guns were kept in the basement in a room opening off of the furnace-room , and the Lieutenant had his headquarters in a little place opposite the laundry . lie not only drilled his company outside and marched them through the house , but he kept them on guard duty at night to relieve the " buck-tails , " as the military guard of the White House was familiarly called . The first night of this military despotism Holiday , who had been appointed a sergeant , appeared before his superior . He saluted and said , " Mr. Lieutenant . I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salute and replied , All right ; I will give the sergeant a pass . " He scribbled something on a piece of paper and handed it to him . The other members of the company were kept lip until ten o'clock that night on guard duty . The next day Haliday , knowing what he had escaped , again sought Lieutenant Tad in his basement headquarters . Taking off his hat , he asked for a pass . But the lieutenant " got mad . " " What kind of a soldier are you ? You malt a pass every evening l " he said . " All right , Mr. Lieutenant . " Haliday was meek enough now . " I will be on duty to-night . " In about an hour Tad sent his sergeant to the National Theatre and left word with another underling that when Haliday returned he was to be given his pass . after all . That night the rest of the company was kept on duty until one o'clock . But that was somewhat too strenuous . Either there was mutiny or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night they were on duty outside . Tad 's taste of command in military matters was so pleasing that he began to enlarge his field of operations . Holiday , aided by the gardener , was about to take up the carpet in the Congressional , or state , dining-room . The long table made it somewhat difficult , and they were debating about which end to attack it from , when Tad appeared . He surveyed the field . " Jim , " he said to Haliday , " I have a favor to ask of you . Jim , grant it , " he coaxed . Jim of course said " Yes , " as every one had a way of doing ? and yet it was n't because it was the President 's son . " NoW , Jim , " he said , taking an attitude of command , " you work with the ether man . I will boss the job . " And Haliday , talking about it , asserts to this day : " Ile told us just how to go about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did . " Haliday tells , too , that Tad often borrowed money of him when some poor man asked him for help and the boy had nothing in his pockets . " And he always paid me hack . He never forgot it . " Taddie could never speak very plainly . He had his own language ; the names that he gave some of us we like to remember to-day . The President was " papa-day , " which meant " papa dear . " Tom Pendel was " Toni Pen , " and I was " Took . " But for all his baby tongue be had a man 's heart and in some things a man 's mind . I believe he was the best companion Mr. Lincoln ever had , one who always understood him and whom he always understood .
