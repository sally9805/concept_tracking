" So Aristides adopted the name of Theodoros , considering himself , his body , life , and power of speech , a gift from the god . RELATIONS WITH DOCTORS. ? There is constant mention of doctors . His attendant Zosimos was skilled in medicine ( 090 ) . But Aristides recognised the god as the only authority , and following his counsels against those of the doctors , though at the same time maintaining friendly relations with them . ? 286 . Aristides had a vision as to the nature of his illness which he related to the doctor , who at once recognised the right diagnosis of the case . He proclaimed Asklepios to be the true healer , and proceeded to consult him on further points . ? 311 . Aristides mentions a renowned doctor of Pergamos , called Satyros , who told him to stop the bleeding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave him . Aristides kept the gift , but refused to stop the bleeding , which the god had ordered . Later on , at Lebedos , he thought he would apply the plaster , and did so , with dire results . The god declared that he had brought on consumption . ? 288 . The doctors were forced to admire the healing powers of the god , when he made the tumour disappear by applying a drug . ? 295 .

Aristides became so accustomed to the help of dreams that he consulted the god on all kinds of subjects . ? 346 . An estate of his was seized by enemies . By the help of the god he gained access to the governor and recovered his property . ? 293 . He was caught in a storm by sea on his way to Chios .

IV . Incubation in the Cult of Asklepios ROME AND LEBENE THE TEMPLE OF AESCULAPIUS ON THE TIBER ISLAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case and the Orations of Aristides , that is , to the second century A.D. , belong the four inscriptions ' of cures found on the Tiber Island at Rome .. On this island a temple of Aesculapius stood , the most ancient , and also the most important , in the neighbourhood of Rome . Both temple and cult were entirely Greek . The worship of Aesculapius does not seem to have been subjected to any process of naturalisation at Rome . Its adoption was direct from Greece , and the new branch kept the same forms as the parent-stem . The tradition of the temple 's foundation , which is well authenticated , is given by Valerius Maximus , who took it from Livy . In 293 B.C. , the Sibylline books advised the summons of the Greek god Asklepios , on account of continued plague . An embassy was sent to Epidauros , as chief centre of the cult , and they brought back the healer in the form of one of the sacred serpents . As they sailed up the Tiber , the serpent landed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A similar legend is found in Pausanias ( iii . 23. 6 ) , concerning the foundation of another offshoot from Epidauros ? the temple at Epidauros Limera. // He relates that a state embassy was sailing from Epidauros to Asklepios at Kos , and touched at Epidauros Limera . A snake that was on board ship escaped , and went down into the earth not far from the sea . " So on account of this portent as well as dreams , they determined to remain and found a colony there . Where the snake went down into the earth stand the altars of Asklepios , and an olive-grove grows round about . " The Tiber Island , where the serpent is said to have landed , is now called the island of San Bartolomeo , and is reached by the bridge of Quattro Capi . On it stands a little monastery with a garden of orange and myrtle trees , and attached to the monastery is the large hospital of the Fate Bene Fratelli , belonging to the brothers of San Giovanni di Dio . It may be conjectured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirably adapted for the modern hospital , accounted also for the foundation of the temple of Aesculapius , likewise the resort of the sick . The temple is now replaced by the church of San Bartolomeo , built in the eleventh century . Some relics of the temple are seen in the church . The monolithic columns and two bases of pillars seem to come from antiquity , and in the middle of the altar steps is a well , the peculiar position of which shows that it must have existed before the foundation of the church . In all probability it had been the sacred well of Aesculapius , and was respected by the Christians when they succeeded to the pagans . The most interesting sign that remains of the ancient sanctity attached to the island is the fragment of the original decoration which is still to be seen when the water of the Tiber is low . At the south-east end of // the island , almost at the point , one descends a little wooden staircase at the side of the morgue , and finds there traces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the island was given the form of a trireme , but the work has been almost wholly destroyed by the swift Tiber floods . Still at this point one sees blocks of tuf a going deep down into the sand , and supporting eight layers of travertine . This represents the side of a ship . On it are vestiges of a human bust ? some hair and the shoulders are clearly distinguishable ? and beside the bust is a staff round which a serpent coils . Aesculapius no doubt was here represented . Farther along is an ox head without ears or horns . Besnier dates the work in the middle of the first century B.C. It is not known to what extent the island was thus decorated , but small traces of stone work have been found at other parts . In the centre of the island stood an obelisk of imperial times , representing the ship 's mast . Its fragments are now in the museums . No sign has been found of the existence of porticos in connection with the temple , but apart from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their presence is attested by passages from various authors . Livy ( ii . 5 ) mentions temples and porticos on the island , and Plutarch ( Popl. 8 ) says : " This island is now sacred for the city . It has temples of the gods and porticos . " As in the other temples they would serve as sleeping-places for the suppliants to the god . The numerous ex-voto inscriptions found at Rome and in the neighbourhood show that Aesculapius was worshipped at different places in the surrounding // district , such as Tibur and Caieta , as well as at Rome . But the introduction of the cult was not followed by striking success . The Roman temple did not prove a rival to the Greek . It seems , on the contrary , never to have risen above a certain level of insignificance . Aristides the Orator , and the Panegyrist of many sanc tuaries of Asklepios , makes no mention of the Roman temple , although he visited the city . From the ex voto inscriptions it appears that its devotees were chiefly slaves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that of Antoninus Pius . The following inscriptions ' . are examples of the dedications on votive offerings given to the Roman Aesculapius : To the saviour Asklepios , Nikomedes , as thank-offering for life preserved . This fair image of the son of the divine healer , boy new-born , thou hast devised and wrought for mortals , 0 Bathos , as a memorial for posterity of thy skilful craft . Nikomedes dedicated it as an offering for deliverance from dire disease , and as a monument of ancient handiwork . To the king Asklepios , as thank-offering for life preserved , Nikomedes , doctor of Smyrna . Such as was the young child who was born to Phoibos of the flowing locks by the daughter of Phlegyas , 0 healer Asklepios , is the statue of fine work which Bathos has wrought for thee with his skill . In this temple thy servant has dedicated it to be seen as a thank-offering for life preserved , since by thy counsels he has been rescued from illness ? a small gift of thankful praise , such as mortal men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The above inscriptions were found near Trojan 's Baths , and belong , probably , to the second or third/ century A.D. In the Tiber Island a small stand of marble , the base of a silver offering , was found with the following inscription on it . The name of the dedicator , Julianus , and the shape of the letters make it probable that it belongs to the time of Augustus . It tells that the object supported by this stand was an image of the organ cured by the god , and runs thus ' : ? To Asklepios , the great god , the saviour and benefactor , saved by thy hands from a tumour of the spleen , of which this is the silver model , as a mark of gratitude to the god : Neochares Julianus , a freed-man of the imperial household . Many other dedications have been found both in Latin and Greek , and they show , by the messages they convey and by their similarity to the votive offer ings of other incubation temples , that the practice was carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the method . For this our only guide is found in the four inscriptions of cures belonging to the Tiber Island . The marble slab on which they were written was lost at the time of the Renaissance , but the text is known from copies . The following is the translation from the Greek ' : - 1 . At this time the god made a revelation to Gaius , a blind man , that he should approach the holy altar and there do reverence ; then go from the right to the left , and place his five fingers on the altar ; then raise his hanru and lay it on his own eyes . He could see // clearly , and the people stood by and rejoiced to see these great powers working in the time of the Emperor Antoninus. 2 . Lucius suffered from pleurisy and had been despaired of by all . The god made a revelation to him that he should go and lift ashes from the triangular altar , and mix them with wine , and lay them on his side . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god , and the people rejoiced with him . 3 . Julianus suffered from hemorrhage and had been despaired of by all . The god made a revelation to him that he should go and lift from the triangular altar some pine-cones , and should eat them with honey for three days . He was saved , and he came and gave thanks publicly before the people . 4 . The god made a revelation to Valerius Aper , a blind soldier , that he should go and take the blood of a white cock along with honey and compound an eye-salve , and with it anoint his eyes for three days . He regained his sight , and went and gave thanks publicly to the god . The Emperor mentioned is either . Caracalla or Antoninus Pius ; therefore the date is the second century A.D. The inscriptions are closely allied to the Epidaurian cures . They are inspired by the same spirit , but their method is different from that of the two classes treated above ? the ancient miracle cures and the Apellas inscription . The closest parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the village of Miamu , in Crete . They belong to the sanctuary of Asklepios at Lebene , which was greatly frequented by the Cretans , according to Philostratos ( Vita Apoll. iv . 34 ) . // LEBENE. ? The Lebene inscriptions differ in form . That of Poplios Granios is spaced widely , with title-lines , and is divided into two distinct para graphs . Inscription I. , on the contrary , has its three parts closely connected by a participial construction in a concise form . The explanation seems to be that the inscription of Granios is the original votive inscription , while the other is one of a series collected for the benefit of the Temple visitors , like those at Epidauros . Remnants of pre-ceding and succeeding inscriptions can be traced on the stele . // A certain woman ( name obliterated ) gives thanks to the saviour Asklepios . She had an inflamed ulcer on her little finger , and was cured by the god , who ordered her to burn and grind down an oyster-shell and apply it . Then to anoint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was cured . I beheld the great powers of the god in sleep , and he bade me inscribe my visions . // To Asklepios . Poplios Granios . According to command . I had had a cough constantly for two years , and the whole day I was bringing up suppurating matter , when the god took in hand to cure me . He gave me an herb , eruca , to take after fasting , and Italian pepper to drink ; fine meal with hot water , then a powder from the ashes of the altar with holy // water ; then an egg and pine-resin ; next black pitch , next the iris plant with honey , then a quince . . The rest of the inscription is fragmentary . Apart from the mention of publicity which is peculiar to the Roman inscriptions , the form of the two sets is , to all intents and purposes , identical . In brief , there is a combination of rational cure with mystic rites . The god does not cure personally as in the ancient miracles , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is not similar to the dietary and hygienic measures of Apellas or Aristides . Mystic medicaments are prescribed and the exact ingredients detailed in the dreams . It is an open question whether the efficacy of these drugs was a negligible quantity , or whether they served some therapeutic purpose . If they were useless paraphernalia , then the cures must be explained as faith miracles . Gauthier , in his Recherche Historique sur l'Exercice de la M ( 'dhcine takes the view that these cures are to be explained independently of hygienic and therapeutic treatment . They would be effected by the powerful influence of the imagination on the nervous system , and by the unlimited confidence which the patients reposed in remedies that they believed to be advised by a god . The first of the Roman inscriptions may be explained in this way . It is a simple faith-miracle . A blind man recovers his sight through conveying the sacred power of the altar to his eyes by touch . Some of the ancient Epidaurian inscriptions were of the same nature . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure . Ointment is prescribed for an ulcer without ceremonies , and its healing // properties would be intensified by the faith of the patient . The prescriptions for the other cases appear to have a deeper significance . They are not rational cures nor simple faith-miracles . Rather they are tinged with the mysticism of magic rites . A symbolic system is conveyed in the ingredients , which stand in special connection and relationship with the cult . Deubner ' proves a close connection between these tokens used as medicaments and the prescriptions given in the papyri dealing with ancient magic , and it seems beyond doubt that these inscriptions of the Asklepios cult express a certain symbolism . The second Roman inscription prescribes ashes mixed with wine for pleurisy , and the second Lebene inscription includes ashes as one of the remedies for the cough . The ashes in both cases were to be taken from the altar , and therein lay their efficacy as a sacred healing medium . Wine , which was to be mixed with the ashes , was much used in the rites of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention of it is found in the Magic Papyri of Kenyon and Wessely . In the third case , pine-cones are prescribed to be taken from the altar , and thus they would be sacred like the ashes . The fact that they were to be found on the altar makes it probable that they were a usual offering to the god , and they are certainly connected with the cult , for Pausanias ( ii . 10 ) , giving a description of the Asklepios of Sikyon , work of Kalamis , says : " The god had in the other hand the fruit of the cultivated pine . " Honey , which was to be taken with the pine-cones , was much used along with wine and milk in chthonian worship , and is frequently mentioned // in the Magic Papyri . The length of the treatment is likewise given in a symbolic way , for the number three had special magic properties . In the fourth inscription , an eye-salve is prescribed to cure blindness . The ingredients , here too , have a connection with the cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed with honey and applied for three days . Honey and the number three both occurred in the previous inscriptions . The cock ww-as , like the serpent , an animal sacred to Asklepios , and it is well known how Sokrates , in the Phaido , just before death , says that he owes a cock to Asklepios . White was a favourite colour for sacrificial animals and in magic rites , according to the Papyri . A salve , such as this , made of blood and honey , is found in Wessely 's New Greek Magic Papyri , p. 93 . The prescription is as follows : " Invocation . Prayer to the star Aphrodite . The blood and fat of a white dove , to Aphrodite as the cock to Asklepios , and the use of collyria or salves in magic and chthonian rites is of frequent occurrence . It is clear from the above that a certain intimate relationship must have existed between the rites of ancient magic and the healing art as practised at the centres of incubation in connection with chthonian gods . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine . It details the ceremonies to be performed when invoking Asklepios before incubation , and the translation is as follows : " Taking a lizard from the water , leave it in lily oil until it dies . Then cut the ring off from the Asklepios at Memphis from the iron chain and throw it into the // lily oil , and when thou consultest the oracle , take the ring and point it to the north , saying these words seven times : Menophoi , 0 thou who art seated on the cherubim , send me the true Asklepios without any hostile roaming sprite . ' Then take the censer where thou art going to sleep , and offer up three grains of frankincense and turn thy finger round in the frankincense smoke , saying these words seven times : Chanaps ; oaeikps ; oaklusiphtha ; 0 lord Asklepios , appear . ' And do thou wear the ring on the forefinger of the right hand . " V. Incubation in the Cult of Asklepios ATHENS AND KOS THE TEMPLES OF ASKLEPIOS AT ATHENS AND Kos . ? Athens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cult of Asklepios , but in neither of the sanctuaries have any clues been found to solve the problem of incubation . The Athenian Asklepieion has been excavated on the south side of the Acropolis , between the theatre of Dionysos and the Odeon . A short description of the sanctuary is given by Pausanias ( i. 21. 4 ) , and this site agrees with his account . The buildings are situated on a long terrace divided into two small terraces . On the eastern terrace one can clearly distinguish the foundations of the temple , to the east a large altar , and behind a long colonnade . This colonnade corresponds to the porticos at Epidauros , and was in all probability the Abaton . Traces of a staircase have been found , so that , as at Epidauros , it was a two-storeyed building . At the east end , next the Dionysiac theatre , a door in the back of the portico leads into a grotto hollowed out in the rock , where there is a sacred well . It is still used as a shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worshipped . The situation of the portico against the Acropolis wall , facing south , made it a salubrious place for the patients who came to sleep there . It can be seen that the colonnade was paved with Hymettian marble , which shows that its date is not // earlier than the fourth century B.C. , nor can it have been much later , to judge from the excellence of the masonry . The date of the foundation of the temple can not be determined , but an inscription ( C. I. A. II . 1649 ) gives a lengthy account of the bringing of the god from the Peloponnese , of the foundation of the sanctuary , and of the subsequent alterations . This inscription dates from the beginning of the fourth century B.C. , so that it is seen that the temple must have existed in the fifth century B.C. On the second terrace have been excavated buildings similar in many respects to those on the first , and while Girard takes these to be duplicates , either of earlier or later date , of the Asklepieion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In support of his theory Girard brings forward an inscription ( C. I. A. II . 1 . Addenda , 489 b ) which speaks of an ancient temple and of a later one , but no inscriptions have been found to give conclusive proof . Nor have we any record of the cures performed in the temple . The only account of treatment is the literary evidence given in the scene of the Ploutos. , which has been quoted above . The grateful patients may have inscribed their cures as at Epidauros , Trikka , and Kos ; at least they agreed with the suppliants at these other temples in the nature of the votive offerings dedicated to the god . An inscription ( C. I. A. II . 835-6 ) gives a list of such offerings , and their variety is great , indicating a clientele from all classes . There were bas-reliefs , statues , images of parts of the body , and hymns in honour of the god . // The priest was regarded as a servant of the god , and the temple was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not figure openly as a doctor . Whether he had skill in medicine is open to discussion . Inscrip tions giving a priest 's duties make no mention of his share iii the cures . In one inscription ( C. I. A. II . 1 . Add. , 453 b ) the phrase occurs : r . c KuO ' EK o-rYjv ? ) , UEpav yu'op vas eEpa7reiac . The reference is to one of the reasons for honouring the priest in whose favour the decree was given . If Oepair ? ' a referred to the cures , then it would prove that the priest had a share in them , but the word is used of temple service , such as the priest was bound to give , and such as is described in the Ploutos as the ditty of the priest . Kos. ? The same dearth of inscriptions dealing with incubation that we have remarked at Athens , is found again in the still more celebrated temple at Kos . It is indisputable that Kos was an incubation centre , although as yet no inscriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which existed between i os and Epidauros would be sufficient guarantee of the fact . In historic times , Kos received an embassy with sacred serpents from Epidauros ( Pans . iii . 23 ) , and whether Kos was thus a colony of the great Asklepieion , or had before received the cult from Thessaly , this much is certain , that the supremacy of Epidauros was recognised by Kos . One inscription ' shows that incubation was practised in the island . Beneath the relief of an eagle stand the words , " Hekataios , according to a dream . " It was found in the ' deme Haleis. // The temple of Askiepios in Kos has not yet been completely excavated , as at Epidauros , but during 1902 and 1903 important discoveries were made by Herzog , who was carrying on the work . At the time of his first visit to the island in 1898 , he was of opinion that the site of the temple was to be located in the plain to the west of the ancient town . He excavated there and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ancient writers to the position of the Asklepieion is given by Strabo and Aristides , who speak of it as " in the neighbourhood of the city . " Paton , ' who visited Kos before Herzog , put forward the surmise that the ancient temple of Asklepios stood near the ruined convent called flavayia T'ls Ta'po-ov , which is situated on a hillside near the Turkish village of Kermeti , about half an hour from the town of Kos . Sections of massive pillars and many marbles were found on this site , and on the hill-side above are red-water and medicinal springs . Herzog began to excavate above this convent in October , 1902 , and the results of researches have verified Paton 's conjecture . The great temple ' stands on a terrace on a slope of the hill , and all its visible structure has been of white marble . It is surrounded by porticos , and a marble flight of steps leads down to the lower terrace . On this stand two other temples , a great altar , and a semi-circular fountain , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large open square , which probably served as a resort for the suppliants to the temple . Of these two temples on the lower terrace one is // supposed to have been the ancient Asklepieion , and the other to belong to the Roman period . The great temple on the higher terrace dates from the beginning of the second century B.C. , and inscriptions have been found ranging from 300 B.C. to the third century A.D. The temple was probably destroyed by the earthquake of 554 A.D. Among the pieces of sculpture already excavated are a fine head of the god , and some serpents . Most of the inscriptions deal with the great games , which were celebrated every four years . Two decrees of the third century A.D. have been found , expressing the gratitude of other cities for the services of doctors who had come to them from Kos . This shows that the medical school of Kos maintained the position of importance to which it was elevated by Hippokrates . In Pliny ( N.H. 29.4 ) we read : " The subsequent history ( of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkest night until the Peloponnesian War , when it was brought into the light of day by Hippocrates , who was born in Cos , a powerful and famous island , sacred to Aesculapius . It is said that he copied out the inscriptions which it had been the custom for those cured of disease to inscribe in the temple of the god , telling the help they had received , so that thereafter similar treatment might be used ; and , as Varro in our day believes , the temple was thereafter burned , and he instituted the medicine which is called clinical . " And in Strabo ( p. 657 ) : " They say that Hippokrates carried out his dietetic measures in accordance with the cures exposed to view there ( at Kos ) . " In another passage ( ii . 53 ) , Strabo classes the votive inscriptions of Kos with those of Epidauros. // As the recent excavations have given us no information regarding these inscriptions , we can only conjecture their nature from the ancient writers . There is no evidence to lead us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Epidaurian inscriptions , were performed also at Kos . Epidauros may have owed its pre-eminence in those early times to the miraculous powers of the divinity . At Kos it would seem that prescriptions were given to those who practised incubation , and those Hippokrates may have studied , thus connecting the divine with the lay medicine , which he developed so greatly that Kos was for long the leading medical school . VI . Incubation at the Oracle of Amphiaraos Amphiaraos ranks among the chthonian deities of prehistoric times . The chief centre of his cult was Oropos , where the Amphiareion is seen to have been a splendid temple , deserving the renown it enjoyed . In central Greece and the Peloponnese Amphiaraos was highly honoured , but , by a curious limitation , his sphere did not extend further . In the east and west Amphilochos , traditionally son of Amphiaraos , took his place and was practically identical with him . In the cult of Amphiaraos his medical powers had special prominence . He was worshipped as a prophetic hero , a giver of oracles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sickness and disease . As a healing god he was honoured from early times to late , and it is evident that he was closely connected with Asklepios , the chief healer . From the cures of Oropos , from a headless statue and a relief , we see that the two gods were portrayed by the same type , and on the relief Hygeia , who figures as daughter of Asklepios , stands by Amphiaraos . Extensive excavations have been made since 1884 at the sanctuary of Amphiaraos near Oropos . From the ruins that have been found , it is judged that the building belongs to Macedonian or early Roman times . About seventy yards to the east of the temple stood a large colonnade , which is taken to be the sleepinghall where incubation was practised . In the centre of the colonnade was a large square room . Round the walls of this room have been found stone supports for // benches , forty-five of which are preserved , while there were fifty-three in all . This central part was probably the dormitory mentioned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temple rules and regulations , and is believed to have been inscribed in the fourth century , between 420 and 350 B.O. The text is given by Wiliamowitz , ' and the translation is as follows : The priest of Amphiaraos shall go to the temple when winter is past until the time for ploughing comes , and shall not leave it for more than three days . He shall remain in the temple not less than ten days each month . And he shall compel the temple servant to attend to the sanctuary according to the rules , and to look after those who come to the temple . If anyone , either a stranger or a townsman , com mit an offence in the temple , the priest shall impose a fine not exceeding five drachmas , and shall take security from the person fined . If he pay the money in the presence of the priest , he shall consign it to the treasury . The priest shall impose a penalty of not more than three drachmas , if any one of the strangers or townsmen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important cases the judgments shall be given where the laws appoint in each case ; summons shall be made on the same day in the court of offences in the temple , and , if the accused does not yield , the trial shall be completed on the next day . All who are about to be treated by the god shall give a preliminary offering of not less than nine obols of standard silver , and shall put it into the treasury in presence of the temple servant . . // The priest , when present , shall pray over the sacrificial victims , and shall lay them on the altar ; when he is absent , the sacrificer himself shall pray over his own sacrifice ; in public sacrifices the priest must officiate . The skin of all animals sacrificed in the temple . . Anyone is free to sacrifice whatever he wishes , but he must not carry the flesh outside the precincts . Those who sacrifice must give to the priest out of each sacrifice the shoulder , except when there is a festival , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . The suppliant goes to sleep .. obedient to the rules . The temple-servant shall write down the name of the sleeper and the name of his city when he pays in the money , and the writing on the tablet shall be exposed to view in the temple for those who wish to see it . In the dormitory , the men and women sleep in different parts , the men in the part to the east , and the women in the part to the west of the altar . In the above inscription it is unfortunate that the lines dealing with the actual process of incubation are indecipherable . All we learn is about the allotment of the east side for men , and the west for women . The rest deals with rules for the priest 's duties , for payment of fees and registration , and for the preliminary sacrificial rites and ceremonies . It is noteworthy that the choice of victim is left to the suppliant ? a liberty which is in direct contrast to the express commands and usual distinctions of black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // deities . Pausanias ( ix . 19 ) gives a parallel in the worship of Artemis at Aulis : " It is said that at Aulis the Greeks had not a favouring gale , and that when the fair wind did spring up suddenly , every man sacrificed to Artemis whatever he happened to have , male and female animals indiscriminately , and from that time it has continued to be a rule in Aulis that all victims are lawful . " It is to be calculated from the inscription that the suppliant held a sort of sacrificial feast after the ceremony . Only the shoulder had to be given to the priest ; the rest he could keep for himself , but the consecrated flesh must not be taken outside the precincts . Hence the necessity for a Homeric banquet on the sacred ground , at which the pious pilgrim would prepare his own meal , and feast to the glory of the god whose suppliant he was . A more comprehensive account is given by Pausanias ( i. 34 ) of the ceremonies in connection with the oracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oropos , and that his renown was due to his power of prophetic dreams . " Near the temple is the spring of Amphiaraos , which it is not right to use for purification or for washing the hands . But whoever is cured of disease in consequence of an oracle has to throw silver or gold coins into the water . It it said that Amphiaraos arose from it a god . . And first , those who came to consult the oracle of Amphiaraos are accustomed to purify themselves , sacrifice to him and to all whose names are on the altars . After the completion of these preliminaries , they sacrifice a ram , and spreading its skin down they sleep on it , and await the manifestation of a dream . " // The first point in the rites was the preliminary sacrifice which was considered as an act of purification , and which is found to be a customary prelude to incubation . Mention of it is made in one of the Epidaurian inscriptions ( No. 5 ) when the same word ( rpoO eo-Baa ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A ram was offered up just before incubation . Similar sacrifices were made in the rites of Trophonios . There was first a preliminary one , and then on the night before consultation a black ram was sacrificed over the pit of the Agamedes . The black colour of the victim and the position in which the sacrifice was made , showed that the offering was to a hero , not a god . In Pausanias ( v. 13 ) a similar sacrifice to Pelops. as a hero is related . After the sacrifice of the ram to Amphiaraos , the suppliant spread the ram skin , and slept on it awaiting the prophetic dream . In Daunia the same ceremonies were performed in connection with the oracles of Kalchas and 1'oila.leirios. 8trabo ( vi . 284 ) relates that " shrines of heroes are shown at the hill in Daunia called I ) rion . There is one of lialchas at the top of the hill . Those who consult the oracle sacrifice to him a black ram and sleep on the skin . " And in Lycophron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Daunia slept on sheepskins by the tomb of Podaleirios , and received oracles from him in sleep . In Italy , at the ancient oracle of Faunus , as described in Aeneid ( vii . 81 ) and Ovid 's Fasti ( iv . 649 ) , a sheep was sacrificed , the skin spread on the ground , and the inquirer slept on it awaiting the oracle in a dream . The prevalence of the usage is due to a belief that the skin of a consecrated victim exercised a sanctifying // and protective influence . Other rites , such as the making of shoes from the skins , originated from the same superstition . Frazer , in his Pausanias , gives an instance in modern times from Pinkerton 's Voyages ( iii . p. 610 ) , where a Scottish Highlander is said to have passed the night wrapped in a cow 's skin , awaiting an oracle . Further ceremonies in the consultation of Amphiaraos consisted in the observance of abstinence and certain dietary restrictions . Philostratos ( Vita A poll . ii . 37 ) says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Amphiaraos ) , and restrain him from food one day and from wine two days . " Fasting is the ceremony of most frequent occurrence in connection with oracles . It produced a certain state of mind which was believed to be conducive to dreams . At Acharaka , the priests left the patients several days without food at the Plutonion , according to Strabo ( xiv . 650 ) . Wine was forbidden , as Philostrafos explains , because of its disturbing influence on the senses . Another probable restriction was laid on beans . In the Geoponici ( ii . 35 ) we find : " And first Amphiaraos abstained from beans on account of his prophetic gift of dreams . " And in a fragment of the Amphiaraos of Aristophanes : " Thou who revilest that finest of relishes , the bean . " The explanation , as given by Plutarch ( Sympos. viii . 10 ) is that beans were believed to act in a special way on the mind , so that dreams were checked . No further details are to be gathered of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been given and the cure effected , it was customary to offer up a model of the healed // part of the body , according to the inscription ( I. G. S. 303 ) . It is probable that this custom , which was also practised in the temples of Asklepios , arose from a more ancient one , by which , before the healing , an image of the member to be healed was hung up in the neighbourhood of the god 's statue , as a sort of guide for the deity . In the inscription of the temple regu lations we are told that certain fees had to be paid , and Pausanias mentions the further duty of throwing coins into the sacred well , after cure . This last rite has been widely practised in a thanksgiving for restored health , both in ancient and modern times . Pliny ( Epist. viii . 18 ) tells that coins were still to be seen lying at the bottom of the Clitumnian spring ; and Suetonius , in his Augustus ( p. 57 ) , says that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtius in fulfil ment of a vow for the health of Augustus . Seneca ( Quaest . Nat . iv . 2 ) gives a reference to Egypt , where at certain festivals the priests threw money into the Nile . In modern folk-lore water-rites play a large part . Everywhere holy wells are to be found , and various ceremonies connected with these . Cornish people still drop into their holy wells offerings of pins , nails , rags , expecting from the waters cures for diseases and omens from their bubbles as to health and marriage . " At Rome , " says Frazer , ' " there still is the Fontana di Trevi , into which people throw coins in the belief they ensure their return to the city . The spring of St. Morand in Brittany is believed to possess the property of curing fever ; patients must resort to it fasting and without speaking . Not many years ago coins were // thrown into it . Now they are put in the poor 's box . " The spring of Amphiaraos , doubtless , proved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping the coins , as required , into it , the suppliant had completed the ceremonies connected with this act of incubation , and was free to depart . VII . Incubation as practised at the Oracle of Trophonios The ceremonies of incubation at the oracle of Trophonios resemble in many respects those of the Amphiareion , but there is one great difference between the two . At the Amphiareion the act of incubation itself was by simple temple-sleep , while the suppliant to Trophonios had to descend into the depth of the earth and there meet with the god . We have evidence that the intercourse which there took place was by means of dreams , so that Trophonios is to be ranked as an incubation-oracle . Celsus ( Apud . Orig. vii . 35 ) classes Trophonios with Amphiaraos and Mopsos , who both appeared in dreams , and Tertullian names him among incubation-oracles . Also Plutarch , De Genio Socratis ( p. 22 ) , supports this view in the account of the sensations experienced by Timarchos when consulting Trophonios . " He said he went down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he was awake or dreaming . " Several authors relate the proceedings in connection with a consultation of Trophonios ; amongst them the chief are Strabo , Philostratos , and Plutarch , and the fullest account is given by Pausanias ( ix . 39 ) . The oracle of Trophonios was situated at Lebadeia in Boeotia , and the shrine was of mysterious formation , somewhat similar to St. Patrick 's Purgatory in Ireland . There was an artificial chasm in the earth , into which the suppliant was let down by a ladder . Once at the bottom , he saw a narrow aperture through which he // had to pass . Pausanias describes the descent thus : " He lays himself on his back on the ground , and holding in his hand barley-cakes kneaded with honey , he thrusts his feet first into the hole , and follows himself , endeavouring to get his knees through the hole . When they are through , the rest of the body is immediately dragged after them and shoots in , just as a man might be caught and dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . They return through the same aperture feet foremost . " The gaseous exhalations , together with the potions and preceding rites , may be taken as an explanation of the supernatural phenomena , or , at least , of the stupefied state of the suppliant when he issued from the god 's abode . The statue of Trophonios by Praxiteles had the characteristics of Asklepios , according to Pausanias , who also says that Trophonios and Hercyna might be taken for Asklepios and Hygeia . This resemblance , as in the ease of Amphiaraos , shows a close connection with Asklepios , and also the prominence of medical powers in the cult . Medical consultations at Lebadeia dated at least from the middle of the fourth century B.C. , and as at Epidauros , a sanctuary of Apollo stood near by . The ceremonies of incubation , given by Pausanias from his own experience , are as follows . First he gives the preliminaries to consulting the oracle : 1 . The suppliant must pass a certain number of days in the house of the Good Daimon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purification . 3 . He must abstain from hot baths , and must bathe in the river Hercyna. // 4 . It is probable that fasting was imposed . Tertullian says that fasting was al ) pointed for those who were going to practise incubation at the oracles , and in the , Tropli.onios of 1iratinos this line occurs : " To take food or indulge in sleep is not allowed . " In the saine play three kinds of fish are forbidden . 5 . He , must sacrifice to Trophomos and various other gods . This was the general sacrifice , which was made also in the case of Amphiaraos , and from which the priest told if the god was propitious. 6 . It was followed by the sacrifice of a black ram over the pit , to Agamedes , on the night before consultation . According to the inwards of this sacrifice , the priest decided whether the suppliant might go down to Trophoriios or not . For the significance of the black ram , compare the similar sacrifice to Amphiaraos . When the sacrificial rites were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . On the night of consultation , two boys , called Herniae , thirteen years of age , took the suppliant to the river Hercy.ua , anointed him with olive-oil , and bathed him in the river . With this we may compare a ceremony practised at the Charonion of Acharaka , according to which boys and youths , stripped and anointed with oil , took a bull and led it to the mouth of the grotto . 2 . The suppliant was taken to the two fountains of Forgetf ulness and Memory , wherefrom he had to drink . The action of certain waters on men 's minds was well-known to the ancients . Philostratos ( VA . Apoll. ii . 37 ) confirms this ceremony and adds : " I could // mention many famous oracles among Greeks and bar barians , where the priest , after partaking of water , gives utterance to the sayings from the tripod . " The suppliant was shown the god 's statue which was hidden from the vulgar gaze , and he did worship to it . The purpose which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suppliant would be the same in form as the deity of the statue . The suppliant had to put on a linen tunic , a ribbon girdle , and shoes , such as the natives wore . Philostratos says that the tunics were of white linen , and Maximus of Tyre ( 14. 2 ) says a red cloak was worn over them . Linen garments were considered to be favourable to dreams . Philostratos quotes Apollomos ( viii . 7. p. 309 ) who always wore linen garments and had much intercourse with oracles and deities : ? It is a sign of purity to pass the night under a linen garment , and dreams too bring prophecies of more worth to such as live like me . " The ceremony of wearing linen was probably introduced from the Egyptian cult of Serapis , according to Bouche-Leciereq . ' Great care was observed in the matter of foot-wear , for shoes came in contact with the holy place and could not be used in ordinary life . Hence , as Frazer ' points out , in many popular shrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convenience of worshippers , who return them after their devotions are over . In the procession at the Andanian mysteries in Messenia , ' the sacred women were not allowed to wear 92 TROPHONIOS shoes , unless made of felt , or the skins of victims that had been sacrificed . Then came the descent into the sacrificial cave . Pausanias does not relate what took place during the intercourse with the god . He merely says : " The future is not revealed to all in one and the same way , but to one it is given to see , and another to hear . " In the De Genio Socratis of Plutarch ( p. 22 ) we find a lengthy account of the sensations of one Timarchus who consulted the oracle , but even the author does not seem to put much faith in his story . It might pass for the wanderings of a chloroform patient . The last act that Pausanias relates before the descent is the holding of honey-cakes in the hands . These were to be thrown to the serpents at the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass in safety . Philostratos also records this proceeding . Honey-cakes were a usual offering to infernal deities . In the zl eneid ( ii . 42 ) Aeneas throws them to Cerberus , to allow him to get past , and barley-cakes kneaded with honey were offered to Sosipolis , a native : lean spirit ( Paus. vi . 20 ) . The length of time after that act up to the suppliant 's return to the upper regions varied , and the actual visions are unknown , but we can judge of the intensity of the experiences by the exhausted and stupefied state of the suppliant , who is said always to have returned in a state of fear and to have lost the power of laughter . Immediately after his return the priests made him relate his vision , and he was compelled to record it on a tablet to be dedicated to the temple . Then still in a state of terror , he was taken back to the house of Good Fortune , where he was allowed to return // to his normal condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscription found at Lebadeia ( G.I.G.G.S. 3055 ) all who consulted the oracle had to pay a silver coin into the treasury and offer ten cakes of the value of a drachma apiece . The same inscription gives a list of those who had done so . VIII . Incubation at the Plutonia and Oracle of Dionysos THE PLUTOVia. ? The worship of Pluto as a medical divinity was a branch of the cult which developed in later times . The god of the lower world was the sender of death , and , consequently , in his hand lay the life of mortals . To him they had to appeal when the dread of approaching death assailed them . This aspect of the worship of Pluto was probably imitated : from the cult of the Egyptian god Serapis , and by Serapis Pluto was overshadowed . In Asia Minor his position was best assured . Strabo ( xiv . p. 650 ) gives accounts of three centres of incubation which were called Plutonia or Charonia indiscriminately . After Strabo no other writer mentions them . The natural inference is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the presiding deity was changed , and that Pluto was supplanted by Serapis whose fame was greater . The first of these three Plutonia described by Strabo was situated near the city of Acharaka , on the road between Tralles and Nysa , in the valley of the Maiander , where there was a grove and temple of Pluto and Bore , and a remarkable grotto , the Charomon , situated above the sacred grove . The god was consulted by sick people through the medium of priests , who lived in the village near the grotto , and with whom the suppliants lodged . These priests personally conducted the dealings with the deity . They practised incubation for the patients , and prescribed the cures // according to their own dreams . Sometimes the patients were allowed to dream for themselves , but they always had recourse to the priests for the interpretation and for guidance how to act . The wide extent of the priesthood 's power is the chief point to be remarked in this section of incubation . Their control over the suppliants was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as we have seen to be the rule in the temples of Asklepios . This new method was due to the influence of Egyptian incubation , and traces of it are found even in the Asklepios cult . Although Aristides usually performed the act personally and independently , he relates in the second of the Sacred Orations ( p. 466 ) how his attendant had a visitation in a dream from the god , who gave him instructions for the proper regime which Aristides had to follow . Restrictions similar to those enforced at Acharaka were made in the Temple of Isis at Tithorea . Pausanias ( x. 32 ) says that there was no admission to the shrine except for those whom Isis herself favoured with an invitation in a dream . He adds that the same was done by the nether gods in the cities on the Maiander , and that they sent visions in dreams to whomsoever they wished to enter their shrines . The second Plutonion in the valley of the Maiarnder , mentioned by Strabo , was at Limon , where there was a sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant . It is inferred that the practices here were similar to those at Acharaka . The third was at Hierapolis . The neighbouring hot baths were connected with the Plutonion according to Strabo , a fact which shows that the consultations were // frequently of a medical nature , so that the baths would form part of the treatment prescribed . The following account is given by Strabo ( xiii . iv . 14 ) of this shrine of Pluto : " The Plutonion is a small cavern under a crag of the overhanging hill , large enough to hold a man and of great depth . In front of it is a square enclosure , about sixteen inches in extent . This is full of thick misty vapour , so that the ground can scarcely be seen . The atmosphere is not injurious , if one goes round about the enclosure , for in calm weather the air is pure , and the vapour remains inside the precinct . But death comes at once to any living creature that enters therein . Bulls , that are taken within , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves have sent in sparrows which fell down at once suffocated . " Here , too , there were special ministers of the cult who acted , most probably , like the priests of Acharaka . Strabo tells that they alone were able to penetrate within the sacred enclosure without succumbing to the vapours , a feat to be attributed eithoc to antidotes or divine providence . DIONYSOS. ? FI.011l ' Into to the chthonian Dionysos is a short step . Both belong to the infernal regions , and the two cults have much the same aspect . Dionysos is the symbol of the earth 's powers , and is in close association with Apollo . As son of the earth he acts by the chthonian mode of inspiration by dreams . At Eana in Macedonia there was a shrine either of Pluto or Dionysos , where the oracle worked by incubation . We learn this from an inscription of imperial times , given by Heuzey , in the Mission Archeol. de Macedoine ( Inse . N. 120 ) : ? // " To the god and lord Pluto , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having seen the god and the temple , dedicated this tablet at his own expense according to a dream through Acherontios , the curator . " For the suppliant the god was Pluto , but the proximity of Thrace makes a connection with Dionysos very probable , for in Thrace the Dionysian cult was all-prevailing . Here too , evidently , the priests or curators performed incubation for the suppliants . Similarly at Amphikleia , in Phokis , there was a medical oracle of Dionysos , where the priests practised incubation , and not the suppliants . Pausanias ( x. 33 ) gives the following account of it : " ( At Amphikleia ) rites are celebrated in honour of Dionysos . There is no entrance into the shrine , nor any visible statue . It is said by the Amphikleians that . the god prophesies for them , and rescues them from disease . He cures through dreams the diseases of the Amphikleians and their neighbours , and the priest is , a prophet , and as a medium gives oracles from the god . " IX . Incubation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religion of Egypt Isis figured as chief ' goddess . She was mother of Horos , the sun-god and ruler of all , and wife of Osiris , while she herself was worshipped as supreme goddess of nature and magic arts . By her possession of deadly and life-giving herbs of the earth , and by her magic spells , she was arbiter of life and death , and thus one of her principal functions was that of healing . A tradition was maintained that Isis was the discoverer of the healing art , and that she appeared in dreams to her patients from the beginning of her activity as a goddess . Diodoros ( i. 23 ) gives the following account of her faculties : " The Egyptians say that Isis discovered many health-giving remedies , and was greatly skilled in medical science . Therefore , when she becarne immortal , she took special pleasure in the healing of mortals , and i , rn sloe ) gave help to those who sought it , manifesting herself clearly and conferring benefits on those who begged for them . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks do , but plain facts . They say that almost the whole world is their witness , for men vie with each other in honouring the goddess for her healing visitations . They say that in sleep she appears and gives help to the sick in their diseases , and heals in a marvellous way those who obey her . Many who had been given up by doctors on account of the gravity of their illness have been saved by her , and many who had lost their eyesight , or the use of // some part of their bodies , have been restored to their former state when they have had recourse to the goddess . " If the above account were to be taken literally , it would mean that the activity of Isis as an iatromantic oracle reached far back into the obscure centuries , and that incubation had been an Egyptian practice from early times . The importance of the role of Isis in medical science can not be denied , but Welcker ' refuses to credit her with the position assigned by Diodoros . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late date in order to strengthen faith in the new practices of their health-oracles by fortifying them with the assurance of antiquity . He believes that only under the Ptolemies did Isis begin to rank as a goddess of healing , that is , when her cult became con nected with the new god Serapis . It may be that then , for the first time , the practice of incubation became general in Egypt , but as a healing goddess Isis had been honoured for many centuries before . In Ebers Papyrus , which dates about 1700 B.c. , references are found to Isis as a medical divinity . It contains for-mule by which she was to be invoked to save the sick as she had saved her son Horos . A remedy is noted which was " prepared for Ra by Isis herself , to rid him of headache . " Such references as these show that the tradition given by Diodoros was no late invention of the priest-hood . Medicine had been a sacred science of long development in Egypt , and the connection of Isis with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the origin of Egyptian incubation remains obscure . // It is possible that it may have been introduced into Egypt from Greece , and adopted as an adjunct to the art already practised . This adoption would involve modifications in the Greek method , for medicine was practised on other lines in Egyptian temples . In Greece , that is in the early times , temple-sleepers expected special personal treatment with remedies for their own particular cases , but the Egyptian priests treated their patients according to fixed and unvarying prescriptions purporting to be of divine origin , and they would continue their original methods , while employing incubation as an accessory . Hence it would seem that there were two stages in the development of incubation . In the first stage , Greek methods were introduced into Egypt , where they developed along national lines . The second stage came by the transference of Egyptian deities to the Greek world , when the practices of Egypt influenced and modified the incubation in Greek cults . Until about the seventh century B.C. , Egypt was a vague geographical expression for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Egyptian oracles became known . The first was Ammon at Kyrene , and there Isis also was worshipped . The cult of Isis was one of the few foreign cults that flourished in Greece . The goddess was introduced into Athens and Corinth by trading merchants , and there her first temples stood . From an inscription found at the Piraeus , we learn of the erection of a temple to Isis before 333 B.C. This inscription is a decree granting land to the merchants of Citium to raise a temple to Aphrodite , for it was . necessary to obtain permission from the Athenian demos , if a foreign god was to have a temple on Athenian soil . The text is as follows : ? " The people have decided to grant the merchants of Citium the right of acquiring a piece of land to found a temple of Aphrodite , in the same way as the Egyptians have founded the temple of Isis . " At Corinth there was a similar early introduction of the goddess , and from Corinth the cult was carried to Phlius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Isis became a popular Greek divinity . The rapid and late growth of her cult was due to her conjunction with the new god Serapis , and together they were worshipped throughout the Greco-Roman world as oneiromantic gods of great healing powers . They were the only two prophetic deities of Egypt that were successfully hellenised . SERAPIs. ? An Alexandrian god , like his city he was Greco-Egyptian by nature . Bouchc-Leclereql describes him as " a Greek body haunted by an Egyptian soul . " Various traditions strive to explain the origin of the god , which is somewhat obscure , and the account of his dual nationality . Tacitus and Plutarch agree in saying that the worship of Serapis began under the Ptolemies . They give the story that an unknown god appeared to Ptolemy I. in a dream , and told him to seek his image in the Pontus . Ptolemy heard that at Sinope there was a statue of Zeus-Hades which corresponded to the description . The Sinopians were compelled to yield the statue , and it became at Alexandria that of the new god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But critics assert that Serapis must be an Egyptian god , the Asar-Hapi of Memphis , // while Krall , in Tacitus and der Orient , reconciles the two theories by saying that Zeus-Hades was taken from Sinope by Ptolemy I. and then confounded with the Egyptian Asar-Hapi . A passage in the Anabasis Alexandri of Arrian seems to contradict this account . In Book vii . 26 we find the following : ? " The king 's chronicles state that Peithon , Attalos , Demophon , and Peukestes , also Kleonienes , Menidas , and Seleukos , sleeping in the temple of Serapis ( at Babylon ) , asked the god if it were best for Alexander to be brought to the temple and to supplicate the god to heal him . And a voice came from the god saying that they should not bring him to the temple , for it would be better for him to remain where he was . These things his comrades reported , and Alexander died not long after , for that was after all for the best . " The story , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Serapis at Babylon , where incubation was practised in the time of Alexander . Some critics , amongst whom is Welcker , take it as a simple anachronism on the part of Arrian , but Iirall asserts that the god designated in the passage is Bel-Zipur , a Baal of Babylon . This Baal was identical with Zeus-Hades of Sinope , who became Serapis . And thus the god who played a part in the death of Alexander afterwards became the Serapis of Alexandria , so that there is no real contradiction of the theory . Serapis was presented to the world as an iatromantic deity , working through incubation . His attributes and function were highly complex . According to Bouche-Leclercq , " under his name were collected the debris of numerous divine personalities worn out by time . " ' // He rose to be supreme as Zeus , and he is lauded by Aelius Aristides for the universality of his benefactions , for he benefited the soul by bestowing wisdom , according to that writer , and the body by bestowing health , while his readiness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his power of medical divination that Serapis owed the great fame he enjoyed . In this respect , as well as in his attributes and position in the theogony , he bears a close resemblance to Asklepios , and Isis is his accompanying goddess , as Hygeia figures along with Asklepios . The connection of the IsioSerapic cult with that of Asklepios is shown in many ways . The deities are seen together on coins , their temples are in close proximity , inscriptions unite their names , and dreamers , such as Aristides , receive joint visitations from them . The temples of Isis and Serapis grew to surpass in number and fame those of any other god . Aristides mentions forty-two in Greece alone , and traces of the cult have been found in many distant countries . To this great vogue of the Isio-Serapic cult is to be attributed the extent to which the practice of incubation spread in the Greco-Roman world during the first centuries of the Christian era . The custom was of primitive origin as we have seen , but what we deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remarked how the features of this later growth show the influence of Egypt . The two most prominent characteristics which distinguish late from early incubation are the secrecy observed and the use of the priest as a medium of communication with the god . Egyptian priests had their own way of making the god speak , and the hellen- // ised oracles of Egypt carried on Egyptian methods in Greece . From the sanctuaries of the Egyptian gods they spread into Greek cults . The practices at the Plutonia in Asia Minor have already been noted , and in turn Egyptian influence is plainly marked , when we compare the two . The most magnificent Serapeum in Egypt was at Alexandria , but we have no account of its healing work . Strabo speaks of the sanctuary at Kanobos , one hundred and twenty stades from Alexandria , in the following passage ( xvii. 1 . 7 ) : " At Kanobos is a temple of Serapis , which is venerated with deep reverence , and which brings to pass cures so that even most distinguished men believe and themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscribe the cures , and others the virtues of the oracles of the place . " We note here , as always in the later incubation , the position of the priest as intermediary between the suppliant and the god , for , judging by the practices at other temples of Serapis , we conclude that the intermediaries mentioned in the passages must be members of the priesthood , appointed for the purpose . This view is confirmed by what we know of the customs at Memphis , where stood the oldest Egyptian temple of Serapis . An inscription given by Egger in the Fevue Archeologique ( 1860 ) proves the existence of an incubation-centre there . It is as follows : ? " I , Aristylles , dedicated this lamp-lighter , considering that I fare ill at the god 's hands , for though I have followed the dreams of the temple , I have not been able to obtain health from him . " An account of dreams given at this oneiromantic oracle of Memphis is found in a papyrus ( Letronne , // Papyri Grecs du Louvre ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of the temple , has written a kind of journal . It dates from about 164 A.D. , and the writer is supposed to belong to the guild of professional mediums , who practised incubation for the suppliants , and who were called hatochoi . They were an institution at Memphis , and traces of their existence are found at other oracles . Pausanias ( x. 33 ) speaking of the iatromantic oracle of Dionysos at Amphikleia says : " He communicates cures to the Amphikleians and their neighbours in dreams . The priest acts as the god 's mouthpiece and gives oracles as a katochos . " The word is used to express the idea of a person possessed or inspired by a divinity so that his state and function were similar to that of a modern medium . Such were the priests at the Plutonia , and in the temple of Asklepios it has been noted that the priests sometimes acted in this way . The only full account which Pausanias gives of the Isio-Serapic cult in Greece is in connection with the temple of Isis at Tithorea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is to be inferred that Serapis shared in the worship , for inscriptions have been found at the place , attesting the sale of slaves to Serapis . The following in his description ( x. 32 ) : ? " About forty furlongs from the temple of Asklepios is an enclosure and shrine of Isis , the noblest of all the sanctuaries made by the Greeks for the Egyptian goddess . For the Tithoreans deem it unlawful to dwell round about it , and there is no admission to the shrine save for those whom Isis herself has favoured with an invitation in a dream . The same thing is // done also by the nether gods in the cities on the Maiander . They send visions in dreams to whomsoever they wish to enter their shrines . In the territory of Tithorea , festivals are held twice a year in honour of Isis , one in spring and one in autumn . Two days before each festival , the persons who are free to enter the shrine clean it out in a certain secret way , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cast in at the previous festival , they always carry to the same spot and bury there . The distance of this spot from the shrine we judged to be two furlongs . That is what they do to the sanctuary on the first day . On the next day the hucksters set up booths of reeds and other improvised material , and on the last of the three days they hold a fair for the sale of slaves and all kinds of cattle , also garments and silver and gold . After noon they betake themselves to sacrificing . The richer people sacrifice oxen and geese , the poorer folk sacrifice geese and guinea fowl . But it is against the custom to use swine , sheep , and goats for this sacrifice . Those whose duty it is to burn the victims and bring them into the shrine must wrap the victims in bandages of linen , either common or fine linen ; the mode of dressing them is the Egyptian . All the animals sacrificed are led in procession . Some convey the victims into the shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and depart in haste . They say that once , when the fire began to burn , a profane fellow who had no right to go down into the shrine , rashly entered it out of curiosity . The whole place seemed to him full of spectres , and scarcely had // he returned to Tithorea and told what he had beheld when he gave up the ghost . I have heard a similar story from a Phoenician . He said that the Egyptians hold a festival for Isis at the time when she is in mourning for Osiris . At that time the Nile begins to rise , and it is a common saying amongst the natives that it is the tears of Isis that cause the river to rise and water the fields . At that season , I was told , the Roman governor of Egypt bribed a man to go down to the shrine of Isis at Coptus . The man who was thus sent returned from the shrine , but after he had told all that he had beheld , he , too , immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homer that it is ill for mankind to see the gods in bodily shape . " In the above passage the prominence of Egyptian ways is noteworthy . Admittance to the shrine was a special privilege , regulated nominally by the goddess who would act through her servant the priest . Sacrifices were offered in the Egyptian fashion , and the secrecy of the shrine , as well as the punishment consequent on profane curiosity , was in accordance with Egyptian ideas . The same idea of mystery is found in another passage of Pausanias ( ii . 13 ) , where he tells how at Phlius , while the statues of Dionysos and Apollo were open to view in their temples , the image of Isis was only to be beheld by priests . PART II . Incubation in Christian Churches during the Middle Ages I. Introduction IT is probable that Christianity in supplanting paganism found the work comparatively easy so far as the Olympian gods were concerned . Their aloofness from the practical affairs of man tended to alienate their worshippers , and it was a simple matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new religion when it sought to dispossess the chthonian deities whose general beneficence and gifts of healing had bound them closely to the people . Worshippers were attracted and their devotion intensified by tangible benefits conferred and help given in times of stress . The faith thus practically engendered and rewarded proved a stubborn barrier to the onward march of Christianity . Paganism made its last stand in the temples of Serapis and Asklepios , and their powers of resistance were due to the cures performed under their auspices in the name of the god . In this struggle for supremacy over the ancient deities , the followers of Christ met the pagans on their own ground and adopted their tactics . Temples were replaced by churches , where Christ was worshipped as // the Benefactor , the Saviour , and the Healer of mankind . These became centres for health-cures , wrought by Christ through some one of His saints , whose per sonality varied according to the district , and miracles of healing were performed in such great numbers as to ensure the popularity of the churches . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of paganism . Many of the ancient customs were retained because they were found to be the best means to the end , but they were covered with a transparent mask of Christianity . It was no longer the deified heroes , known as chthonian gods , that were honoured as miracle-workers , but Christian saints , who had been pre-eminently virtuous men , and after death had received the semi-deification of sainthood . Still there was no great gulf between the two types of agents . The methods were so similar , as will be shown later , that we are led to regard the saints as successors of the heathen gods . This point of view receives strong support from Dcubner . ' He traces a connection between St. Cosmas and St. Damian , the chief doctor-saints at Constantinople , and the Dioscuri , who formerly had an incubation-temple in the same place , and with whom St. Cosmas and St. Damian were confounded by Greek clients . In Egypt St. Cyrus and St. John supplanted , according to the chronicler , a local demon Menuthes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no far-fetched conclusion to suppose that the similarity in ideas and practices of such churches and temples arose from a Christianising of the pagan shrines and the retention of the former methods in order to suit the customs of the clientele . // Owing to the indefiniteness of the records with which we have to deal , the question of chronology is left in a somewhat vague state . Roughly speaking , the first ten centuries of the Christian era form the epoch of the miracles which are detailed afterwards . The majority belong to the sixth and seventh centuries , but there are similar instances in the tenth and in the third and fourth centuries , so that in point of time the practices were continuous . There is no gap , but rather an overlapping between the two periods . While the Catholic Church sought to enforce unity , she could not check the tendency to local variations . In the narratives of the saints ' works , God is acknowledged as chief over all , and as the source of the miracles , but since prayer was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the deity , and his was the prominent place as protector and patron . Local characteristics and superstitions figured in religion as much as in the times when each district had its own patron ? Zeus , Athena , or Artemis . The great difficulty which the student of religious practices encounters is the legendary character of the chronicles from which he has to draw his information . It is impossible to take any particular story as the basis of a theory . It may really be a tradition concerning some heathen god which has been transferred to the saint ; or even if the story has been founded on historical events occurring in Christian times , yet by reason of exaggeration and amplification it may be unreliable . The most trustworthy chronicles are , of course , those of personal experiences , but here again inaccuracy arises from the subjectivity of the writer 's point of view . He does not profess to write a statis- // tical or exhaustive account of the saint 's doings . He gives a series of narratives , selected according to his personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the account of St. Fides by Bernard of Angers . ' He relates only a few instances to illustrate the medical side of her work preferring the stories which show how quick she was to punish wrongdoers . Prominence is given by all writers to cases of con-version , and to the care which the saints bestowed on men 's souls as well as on their bodies . Although it is impossible to assert the exact extent of the medical department in the Christian churches ' work , yet there is sufficient proof that the custom of incubation was a widespread and popular one during these later centuries , as it had been in former times . It can be traced throughout Europe , and in Asia Minor and Egypt , flourishing in all parts as did the cult of Serapis . The number of churches at Byzantium , in which this custom was carried on , is large , for this city where the Dioscuri and Aniphiaraos had healed the sick was made the metropolis of saints . We know of six churches of St. Cosmas and St. Damian ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suburb ; the churches of St. Cyrus and St. John , and of St. Therapon , were all situated at Byzantium , and all were famous for health-cures through incubation . St. Cosmas and St. Damian were worshipped in many parts of the world . Especially renowned were their churches at Rome and at Kaufburg in the country of the Suevi , and throughout Gaul various of their relics were cherished . St. Cyrus and St. John , another pair of medico-saints , had their chief church near // Alexandria , a great centre for the healing of the sick . St. Michael 's cult pervaded all Europe . We know of incubation in connection with it both at Rome and Byzantium . In Asia Minor , too , the archangel was popularly worshipped , and at Seleucia in Isauria we find St. Thekla working through incubation . In Gaul various saints were cherished as patrons and physicians . Gregory of Tours tells of incubation in connection with St. Martin ' at his church in Tours , and with St. Julian ' at Arvernus ; and we have records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Maximinus4 at Troves . In Britain , too , there are traces of the prac tice of incubation . Bede tells how St. Peter appeared to Archbishop Laurence at Cambridge , in the church of St. Peter and St. Paul , which had been built by Aedelbert in 613 , and was of high authority in the land . The passage ' is as follows : " When Laurence was about to leave Britain , he bade a bed be prepared that night in the church of the blessed apostles , Peter and Paul , in which after many tears and prayers to the Lord on behalf of the state of the church , he laid his limbs to rest , and the blessed chief of the apostles appeared to him . " This is clearly a case of incubation where the suppliant wishes to consult about a difficulty . Also , we read ' that in the same church a paralytic was cured as he slept at the tomb of St. Letard , who was buried there . Thus from Britain to Asia Minor , in Gaup // Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of incubation was prevalent . The methods of the later period of pagan incubation are found to a great extent unchanged at the shrines of Christian saints . The prominence given to vigils and prayers is noteworthy . Fasting was often combined with them , as they were performed at the tomb or before the image of the saint . The rites by which pagan suppliants were prepared for incubation went on the same lines , and produced a similar state of mind . Three kinds of incubation must be distinguished . First , there is incubation in the voluntary sense , when the suppliant , after some preliminary ceremonies , lies down in the church with the intention of sleeping and receiving a visitation from the saint whom he has invoked . Second , when the suppliant falls asleep , sometimes , it is stated , by chance , and at other times the saint is said to send sleep to him , and while asleep he has a vision which gives him the help or guidance required . This may be termed involuntary incubation . Third , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets into a certain soporific state of mind and has a divine visitation . This third class figures largely at the shrines of saints ; but whether the cures are to be attributed to self-suggestion , hypnotism , or divine interference is an open question . Miracles brought about in these three ways are performed by the saint at his shrine or in his church . The methods are not naturally exclusive . The practices were carried on side by side in the same place and in the name of the same saint , and it is often difficult to distinguish in which state the miracle has happened . Ancient writers laid no stress on such // differences , and did not seek to draw the distinctions or to mention if the suppliant were sleeping when he was cured . Some cases , however , are always found to correspond to the ancient types of paganism . As in the heathen temples , the visions are of two distinct classes . First , there are visions during which the patient is healed by the saint : either an operation is performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man wakes up cured . Second , the celestial visitant appears and gives directions for the cure . He may prescribe a remedy or order a certain mode of action . A third kind of miracle which frequently occurs may be included in the first class , but owing to its indefinite nature it is unimportant for our subject . The patient is often said to be healed merely by presence in the holy church . These are the instantaneous cures which are characteristic of modern miracle centres such as Lourdes . The first class of miracles contains cases which form remarkable parallels to the narratives of the Epidaurian inscriptions . For example , the cure of the dropsical woman in the Encomium of St. Therepon ( ? 2O ) , which is given in detail further on , recalls forcibly the works of Asklepios . Also , in the miracles of St. Cyrus and St. John ( No. 62 ) , an incubation patient , passing the night in the church near Alexandria , describes a scene which resembles the story of Karion in the Ploutos of Aristophanes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the chief feature of the later pagan period , and the predominance was continued in the Christian churches . It is noteworthy that the remedies have in most cases a clear symbolic signifi- // cation . As iu the temples of Asklepios sacred ashes were ordered to be taken from the holy altars , so the suppliant to St. Therapon or St. Cyrus had to cure himself by the application of wax from the church candles or lamps . The general character of the diseases cured is the same as that given in the pagan records . The accounts . are not exhaustive , so that statistics would be useless , but the prominence of blindness , lameness , and paralysis is striking . The saints are not baffled by " incurable " diseases , but these are rather their speciality . A special feature of Christian churches was the cure of demoniacs . People with certain symptoms resembling those of epilepsy or lunacy were believed to be possessed by evil spirits , and were taken to the holy church , where the demons would be driven out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm that writers say they saw the evil spirits leaving the man when the saint drove them forth . Whether we identify demoniacs with lunatics , or hold with antiquity that there was a special irruption of otherwise bodiless spirits , the fact to be dealt with is that Christian churches became an asylum for people so afflicted . The Canons of the Fourth Council of Carthage ( 90-92 ) show that the cure of demoniacs was a regular practice in the churches . The exorcists. were bound to lay their hands on them each day , while they lived in the church and had to sweep it out daily . The temples of Asklepios and Serapis became , as we have seen , health-resorts where crowds of invalids and valetudinarians stayed , waiting for restoration of health , during an indefinite period which sometimes extended to years . Some churches of the saints . // developed into similar establishments . It is clear from many of the records that sick and infirm people came for a sojourn at the church with the intention of waiting till they were cured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or years . Such a system of residential patients implies the maintenance of a large establishment . Hospices and baths adjoining the churches are frequently mentioned in the narratives , and great crowds came to invoke the saints , filling the hospices and sacred buildings . The presence of demoniacs , too , must have necessitated further accomo dation . We read of a demoniac chained to a stair-case in the church along with many others , waiting for divine aid . ' In these establishments , which must have resembled the temple buildings at Epidauros , with the church as centre , servants , attendants , and religious officials would have many duties to fulfil , and in the more important churches their numbers must have been great . Mention of attendants on the sick and the demoniacs is made occasionally , and church officials figure in some of the stories . The priests or monks had naturally the important role , taking the part of the pagan priests . The absence of scepticism in the records , all of which are written by devotees , prevents us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their contrivances . The question of the genuineness of the miracles must be left aside . The stories show us the priests discharging three functions . First , they are caretakers and attendants of the sick and insane . Second , they act as inter mediary priests , praying for the afflicted and by their intercession obtaining healing for them . Likewise // they perform the usual church services . Third , they are exorcists of demons . At the church of St. Maximinus this function is prominent . The " Brothers " act as exorcists and pray for the departure of evil spirits . Presumably similar work was done at the church of St. Therapon , where demoniacs were taken in charge . II . St. Cosmas and St. Damian Cosmas and Damian suffered martyrdom at Aegae in Cilicia in the third century A.D. According to the tradition , they were doctors of Arabian race who tra velled over the world curing the sick and preaching Christianity . In the consulship of Diocletian and Maximianus in 287 A.D. , they were put to death and buried at Aegae . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyrus in Syria . The chief church of these saints was at Constantinople . It was already famous in 516 A.D. Procopius relates that Justinian was cured in this church , which he thereafter restored . It was built in the time of Theo dosius Junior , and was situated in the Zeugma or Ceraticum . Gregory of Tours2 gives a brief resume of the saints ' powers and methods in the following passage : " The twins , Cosmas and Damian , doctors by pro fession , after they became Christians , dispelled the infirmities of the sick merely by the merit of their virtues and by the intervention of their words . After suffering various tortures , they joined the immortals and showed many miracles to men below . Any man who prayed , inspired by faith at their tombs , at once received medical treatment . Some say that they appeared in vision to the sick and told them what to do . If these carried out the advice , they went away cured . I have heard many particulars , but I think it // would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have said is sufficient . All who prayed in faith departed healed . " The miracles of St. Cosmas and St. Damian which are recorded were wrought in the church at Byzan-tium . The author is unknown , and the date of the writing can not be ascertained , but it belongs to either the sixth , fifth , or fourth centuries A.D. The resem-blance between these miracles and the Epidaurian cures is so great that an attempt has been made to trace a connection betwen the saints and the pagan god Asklepios , who was worshipped at Aegae . But St. Cosmas and St. Damian are localised as miracle-workers at Byzantium and not at Aegae , so that if any connection exist , it must be with some Byzantine god . Deubnerl connects them with the Dioscuri who healed through incubation at Byzantium . Hesychios Miles ( 15 F.H.G. iv . 149 ) says : ? " The temple of the Dioscuri , Castor and Pollux , ( was constructed by Byzas ) on the altar of Semestri and at the confluence of the river , and in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not here mentioned , but in a scholium on Persil 's ( ii . 56 ) we find : ? " In the temple of Castor and Pollux , interpreters of dreams are usually kept to expound purely and clearly men 's visions . " Thus the temple must have been used for incubation . Further in the same passage we read : ? " When the Romans were suffering from a pestilence , Castor and Pollux told the people in dreams by what remedies they would be cured . " The temple at Byzantium was in all probability used for rich people , like the temple at Rome . Further , // Deubner shows that the Greeks who came to Byzantium were apt to consider St. Cosmas and St. Damian as their own gods , Castor and Pollux . A Greek is healed in the church of the saints , converted by them , and shown his error in believing that he was being cured by Castor and Pollux . This relationship between the pagan and Christian twin-doctors can only be suggested , for there is no positive proof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work that the Dioscuri had been doing in Byzantium . As we study the miracles in detail , we see the deep imprint of paganism in the practices . The theory was Christian . The saints , Cosmas and Damian , were considered as subordinates of the most high God , with whom they interceded for men , and whose will they carried out . Repeatedly in the miracles they are described as the servants of God , and their powers of intercession are frequently mentioned . This theory of relationship to the Supreme Power is illustrated in an extract from the life of St. Theodore ( ? 73 ) , Bishop of Galatia , where the worship of Cosmas and Damian was popular . Theodore fell ill one day , and when despairing of recovery , he had a vision of St. Cosmas and St. Damian . They promised to intercede for him with the King , when he explained his grief at having to leave his flock so soon . On their return , the saints brought with them a youth like an angel of surpassing glory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant longer lease of life . He then departed , and St. Cosmas and St. Damian told Theodore to rise and care for the souls of others . Another cure , in which God was the central figure , overshadowing the doctor-saints , was wrought for a // man who had an ulcer in his finger ( ? 204 ) . He went to the church at Byzantium seeking for healing , and there " God manifested Himself invisibly to him , " through the prayers and intercessions of Cosmas and Damian . The ulcer gradually healed . In the great majority of cases the saints appear alone as agents of God when invoked . Particulars of the visions are scanty , but in a few cases the appearance of the visitant is described . Naturally the dreamer saw them in the semblance of their images ( ? ? 73 , 219 ) , or in the guise of some acquaintance . " Cosmas came one day clothed in a cloak , in the likeness of Gaudiosus , a monk " ( ? 188 ) . This monk , afterwards Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he adds , " I knew him well , since it was not an illusion , nor was I sleeping . " Here is a clear case of a vision which came to the patient ? ' , rap , i.e. , in a waking state . In other cases the word " invisible " is used of the action of the saints in healing . " The saint laid a hand on his and thus invisibly healed him " 0192 ) , and " God manifested Himself and declared Himself invisibly to him " ? 204 ) . The belief in a divine invisible presence accounts for these statements . But the most frequent visitation was that which came in sleep to a suppliant practising incubation . The church was the regular and official place for this incubation . " Cosmas and Damian appeared to her in the church according to their custom in a vision " ( ? 198 ) , and " Since miracles of this kind were performed every day , constant crowds of sick people came to the church , " i.e. , at Byzantium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thigh was , after // long suffering , advised to go to the church of Cosmas and Damian . They appeared to him at his home and said , " Come to us . Thou wilt be healed . " He obeyed , and his cure followed ( ti175 ) . In some cases presence at the church was not essential either for a visitation or a cure . The recovery of St. Theodore through the help of the saints ( ti 73 ) took place at his home ; Justinus ( ? 185 ) is visited and cured in Scythia ; a Phrygian woman ( 019 ) has visitations from the saint , and receives medical treatment . This last story is remarkable in several respects . Constantine , a soldier of Constantinople , married in Phrygia while at the wars . His wife suffered from an ulcerated breast . Constantine was a devout worshipper of St. Cosmas and St. Damian , and spoke of their healing powers to his wife . By night she had a visit from them , and they promised to cure her . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recognised them from her description which tallied with his images of St. Cosmas and St. Damian . A second and third time the visitation was repeated , and active measures were taken for her cure . During the second visit they asked the woman her symptoms , and told her to open her mouth . One of them put his finger in , and blood flowed out . In the morning she was cured . The third time they appeared they told her to anoint herself with wax from the light over her head , and she would suffer no ill thereafter . The medical treatment which these two saints gave was either of an active nature ? ranging from mere touch to a surgical operation ; or it took the form of a prescription . In the above story both kinds of treatment figure . Instances of simple touch are found in // ? ? 192 and 209 . " The saints laid their hands upon the man and cured him . " A more complicated process is the surgical operation in ? 225 , where the resultant scar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes these accounts of miraculous feats of surgery performed on a sleeping patient by divine hands have a strong flavour of tradition , but although the details can not be guaranteed , they are interesting for two reasons . First , they show that a certain surgical activity was commonly attributed to the saints ; and secondly , they form an interesting parallel to the ancient cures in the Epidaurian inscriptions . One of the most curious of these stories is attached to the church of St. Cosmas and St. Damian in the Via Sacra at Rome . An official of the church had his whole leg consumed by cancer . While sleeping , he saw Cosmas and Damian approaching him with ointment and instruments . A curious conversation took place between the saints . One asked the other where they could get flesh to fill up the space made by the amputation . The other recalled the fact that an Ethiopian had that day been buried in the cemetery . They went and brought the dead man 's hip to give to the sick man , and his hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and whole . He told his story , and when they went to the cemetery , they found that the Ethiopian had the patient 's hip instead of his own . Another operation ( ? 189 ) was performed on a dropsical man . The fluid was allowed to run out , and then his body was healed up again . The second form of medical treatment was the prescription of remedies by the saints . The following are a few examples of their dietetic measures . A man // with hemorrhage was told to cease eating flesh and to eat cakes made with flour ( ? 195 ) . A woman ( ? 198 ) received a prescription of herbs for a pain in her breast . She had to drink laser mixed with pennyroyal . She was cured , but the writer adds , " The virtue of the saints cured the disease , and she made use merely of the names of the herbs . " The belief , therefore , was that the power of the prescription did not lie in the healing properties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The relations existing between the lay-doctors and the churches , as centres of healing , were characterised by a spirit of rivalry . In almost every case the uniform statement is made that the doctors of medicine had been consulted , but that their skill had been of no avail . The sick man then had recourse to the divine healers , and in so doing met with opposition from the regular practitioners . Sometimes the doctors are involved in the cures . A woman with an ulcerated breast ( j216 ) refused to allow her doctor to perform the operation , and said she would consult St. Cosmas and St. Damian . He laughed and told her she would return in a worse state of health . But she went in faith . The doctor then had a vision of the saints , who told him to go to the church and cut the woman 's breast at the place they indicated , and then to apply a medicament which they gave him . He obeyed , in contrast to his former mockery , but found that the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply the medicament . Again we . read ( 094 ) of the doctors being summoned to the church to cure an internal disease . Their efforts were unavailing , and then Cosmas and Damian allowed the man to recover , // whereupon he gave thanks to the saints for his recovery , amidst the discomfiture of the doctors . One patient takes his doctor with him to the church as nurse-attendant ( 5209 ) . The saints appeared to him , and said they would cure his charge . This they did by mere touch . Another case 0216 ) occurs where the saints appeared to the doctor as intermediary , and another prescription ( ? 195 ) is given not to the sufferer but to some person who was probably a church-official . The victories of the saints over demons receive special comment . Evil spirits were regarded as the originators of diseases , and in healing men the saints routed the demons . A youth ( ? 192 ) was reduced to debility by a demon and " prayed night and day at the church to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . An ulcerated breast ( ? 216 ) is attributed to a demoniacal attack , and similarly a church official is said to suffer from various diseases sent by a demon ( 235 ) . Sick people who visited the church were accustomed to await healing for weeks or months . No mention is made of hospices or accommodation for the sick , but the church must have resembled other establishments where cures were given , for St. Cosmas and St. Damian often tarried some time before they had pity on the suppliants . One man ( 175 ) lay for a year in the church , and another ( ? 225 ) spent seven months there before the healers came to him . Funds must have been forthcoming for the maintenance of this hospital . The mercenary aims of the saints are not obtruded on our notice , although gifts acted as spurs to the healers . A man , suffering from arthritis ( ? 149 ) , promised Cosmas and Damian a waxen offering and recovered his health . // Ile forgot his promise , but was reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vow , and at office was cured . More efficacious was the action of a woman who had a paralysed arm . She offered up a wax offering and received healing straightway . At the church of the saints at Iiaufburg in the country of the Suevi , donations are a , prominent feature in the miracles . These incidents are , however , of later date . The church was begun in 1496 , and the first entry dates 1628 . Promises and vows were made in almost every case , and were various in nature ? masses , services , candles , tapers , images , and money . A story is given of two men who were both ill . While one promised a gold ducat and received healing , the other made no offering and was not cured . III . St. Therapon The miracles of St. Therapon are recorded by a writer whose identity is unknown . Deubner , ' reasoning from the style of writing , assigns the Encomium to the beginning of the seventh century A.D. It thus would belong to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sophronios . In two passages ( ? ? 10 , 28 ) we find a topical reference in which the martyr is entreated to help the Christians at this time of stress . " Have pity now on the Christians hard pressed round about by the heathen , or , rather , share their troubles . and save the city in which thou bast come to dwell " ( ? 10 ) . Byzantium was besieged by land and sea in 626 A.D. , and the Persian king was at Chalcedon . There is every probability that this was the crisis to which the writer refers , and the Encomium may date from this year . The account is a contemporary history . The stories are not drawn from tradition or historical data , but from present-day events . One miracle ( ? 24 ) was witnessed by the writer himself along with many other people , and his aim throughout is to relate occurrences for which he can vouch . The general character of his work is thus summed up ( ? 1 ) : ? " Great is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters I have poured into my ears tales which do not mislead or attract the mind by a fine , narrative style , but which derive their credibility from the personal nature of the experiences . For our subject does not concern dead affairs , the antiquity of which permits the recorder to deal with what is past and gone in a // persuasive rather than truthful manner . The miracles which we record have been wrought on living men . " In addition to the two sources already mentioned , some of the stories may have been derived from records in the church . The Italian demoniac ( ? 12 ) , who was cured , had his experience inscribed on wax tablets , in all probability according to a custom of the place . The church where the relics of St. Therapon reposed was in Byzantium , but its exact site can not be located . Therapon had been a Cyprian monk , then bishop , and had been buried in the island . But on the invasion of the Saracens , his relics were conveyed for safety to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God ( ? 10 ) . Among the many churches of the Virgin at Byzantium , there was a famous one in the district of Blachernae , and evidence points to this as the site of the church of St. Therapon . A vague clue is given in the story of the demoniac ( ? 12 ) . While sleeping somewhere in the district of Blachernae , he had a vision telling him to go to the church of the Mother of God , called Elaia . His cure , which took place there , is attributed to St. Therapon . The account is as follows : ? " A certain man of Italian nationality , Florinus by name , was possessed by a legion of demons , and was going to hurl himself down from the wall of Blachernae on to the ground . He was stopped by some people who noticed his state of perturbation , and he was put under guard . When three hours had passed , he seemed to be rid of the demons , for his trouble was abating . Later he spoke sensibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lay down quietly and was at // rest . About midnight a vision came to him giving this message : Go to the church of the Mother of God called Elaia . For there you will be healed of your affliction . ' When day came , he ventured to tell the vision , and he was conveyed by those whom he told of it . He had only stepped on the basement of the church when his body was wrenched and twisted , and he had a violent convulsion . Then he gave an unintelligible shriek , and was much enraged against those who held him . Lastly , he fell down prone on the floor , and remained speechless for several days . As he fell down , the horrible demons were put to flight by the visitation of the martyr , just like a pig by a blow , and as they departed , they had the appearance of smoke in the air . So he was completely cured of his trouble , and gave glory to Him who had wrought the cure through the saint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assurance of his cure . Then rejoicing he set forth for his own people , and wrote on wax tablets the celebration of his trouble and his release . " On analysing this story , we find that Florinus has converse with the saint three times . The first time he had been taken by his rescuers to a certain place , where he passed the night and had an incubationvision . Thence the same people , obeying the instructions of the vision , took him to a " house of prayer , " where he was cured by the saint . Thirdly , he had another vision assuring him of his cure . The name Elaia is unknown . The most plausible conjecture is that his rescuers were servants of the church , where it was usual to deal with demoniacs , and that all took place within the sacred precincts of the church of the // Virgin where St. Therapon was worshipped . The chapel called Elaia would thus be part of the great church of the Mother of God at Blachernae . This church became one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were physically distressed or troubled in soul , or were wasted by periodic and violent fevers , and who betook themselves to this divine hospital , were first rid of their spiritual affliction , and so received physical perfection . For such I take to be God 's method of healing . First he cures the sick man 's soul , by which it is right that the body be trained , then to the body too he gives perfection , so that the completion be not faulty in any respect , but that the individual may again enjoy perfection , as from nature or a remodelling " ( ? 19 ) . This statement of the divine method in healing men 's bodies is in accordance with the records of other saints . The aim of the martyr was " to perfect souls day by day and bring bodies to perfection , so that through him believers might attain to the perfect man " ( M1 ) . The practice of incubation at the shrine of St. Therapon , as related in the Encomium was of similar character to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of miracles . First , the cases in which the cure is performed by the martyr , and , secondly , the cases in which the martyr appears and gives certain instructions for the cure . To the first class belongs the story of the dropsical woman ( ? 20 ) , which is similar to some of the Epidaurian inscriptions and to one of the cures of St. Cosmas and St. Damian ( ? 189 ) . " A woman suffering from dropsy was laid down in the place . She saw the holy man opening up her toes ; then she awoke , for she had been asleep when she // was treated by the martyr . On awakening , she at once bent down to her feet , and saw below water mixed with pus and blood flowing from her feet like a stream . When this was once fully discharged , her body was free from disease and the dropsy had left her . " Then the writer comments on the number of cases which received like treatment from St. Therapon , and which he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two classes of miracles can not be deter-mined . A dumb and paralysed man ( ? 21 ) also receives personal treatment from , the saint . He had a vision of the saint anointing him with sacred ointment . On awakening he found himself cured . Another man who had an ulcer thought he was cured in sleep by the application of a salve . He saw the saint and awoke healed in the morning . Only one instance of the second kind of vision is related ( 06 ) . A decarch of military rank , whose body was terribly distorted , hnd recourse to the saint and re mained in the church for several days . Then he heard an " unseen voice " telling him to have himself anointed with olive oil " by an official of my church . " This was done , and the man was straightway healed . The mention of a church-official acting as ministrant to the sick is noteworthy . The use of the word " unseen " points to an incubation-vision , for it occurs in other cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Cosmas and St. Damian ( ? ? 192 , 202 ) the epithet " invisible " is applied to the miracle-worker ; and when Timarchus consults the oracle of Amphiaraos , l he is addressed by " some one not seen . " Other remarkable cases of miracles given in the // Encomium are the following . Theodoros ( ? 16 ) , a paralytic , lay in the church for thirty days . " He saw the wonder-worker giving him bread and a goblet full of pure wine . He was rising up , as it seemed , to receive it , and leapt up ; in truth , he started up shouting and praising God . " It is clearly implied that this cure was effected during incubation . The expression rJ aoK ? Ev ? as it seemed ? is in direct opposition to v dANO ? i ? in truth ? i.e. a sleeping vision opposed to the waking state . Prolonged presence in the church often preceded the miracle of healing . A woman , suffering from cancer ( ? 17 ) , remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on the ground . Then she was freed from the disease by the saint , in a mysterious manner , the writer says . A gradual cure was wrought on Anastasios ( ? 15 ) , who had a withered hand . " He reached the haven of peace ( i.e. , church of St. Therapon ) , and fixed his hopes upon the saint . For nine days his soul was calm , and so full and perfect did his body become , that when the feast of the Nativity drew near , he was able to work with both his hands . " The length of the patient 's stay in the church was variable . One man with a bent body ( ? 19 ) had to stay some time in the " healing-house of the martyr " before he was cured , while a second man suffering from the same complaint did not require to be long in attendance upon the saint ( o ? , roXXdv 7rpoo ? dptdv ESE791j ) but at once on entering he had pity shown to him , and departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a witness ( ? 24 ) . A man had been beaten by soldiers until he was half-dead . Late in the evening he was // taken to the church , and all who saw him , amongst whom was the writer , despaired of his recovery . " But the martyr cured him during the night , and , when day came , sent him away healed , while we , seeing what had been done , were filled with wonder . " One case of punishment ( ? 22 ) is found in the Encomium- . " Occasionally the saint gave affliction instead of health for the sake of salvation . For example , a woman came to the church to pray . She found there a little child possessed of an evil spirit which was being expelled from him . The woman thought it was a jest and laughed . The saint sent the demon into her , and for five days she was possessed , then she was cured . " N. St. Thekla St. Theklal was worshipped at Seleucia , chief town of Isauria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basil , Bishop of Seleucia , who was a special protege of the saint . She herself was of literary tastes , and the citation of a line of Homer by a patient won her favour so that she was willing to heal him ( mir . 24 ) . Naturally she encouraged Basil in his literary work . She appeared to him ( mir . 16 ) when he was becoming negligent , and by look and gesture showed him how pleased she was with what he had already written . At other times ( mir . 27 ) she would appear to him by night , and show him certain books that would help him in his work . This relationship and the impressionable nature of the man forcibly recall Aristides the Orator who received similar patronage from Asklepios . Basil first gives an account of the life of Thekla , and of her connection with St. Paul . She settled in Seleucia , where Sarpedon , a Greek demon , had a strong hold on the people . She fought against his influence , and by her miracles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end came thus ( Bk .. I. p. 122 ) : ? " Living she sank down and entered into the earth . Thus glory was given to God through her , and the earth was rent for her . In that place the holy altar has been set up , and for all suffering and for all infirmity she sends forth from thence sources of cures so that the place is a medical centre for all people . " // In Thekla we recognise the Christianised Greek chthonian god . A human being , after a life of special sanctity and beneficence , is shielded from ordinary death and enters into the earth , thereupon becoming deified . Thus it was with Ainphiaraos , who , like Thekla , was believed to send forth his healing powers from the earth . Sarpedon , whom Thekla replaced , was also a chthonian god , associated with Apollo at Seleucia , according to Diodoros ( 32. 10. 2 ) . Thekla did not succeed in completely suppressing Sarpedon , for mention of his activity is found in some of the miracles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heathen woman with a lame foot , was first attempted by Sarpedon , then achieved by Thekla . The conversion of the patient follows . Aristarchos , a sophist ( mir . 26 ) , is despaired of by all , but cured by Thekla . He is , however , not converted from his impiety , but persists in giving the honour to Sarpedon , who had told him to have recourse to the martyr . For this ingratitude he apparently receives no punishment . A noteworthy point in St. The.kla 's work is the absence of mercenary motives . No mention is made of payment exacted , or even of voluntary offerings , except in mir . 8 , where it is stated that quantities of birds of various kinds were kept in the open templecourt . Among them were swans , geese , pigeons , and Egyptian birds , which had been dedicated to the saint as votive-offerings . It must be supposed that more valuable contributions were sometimes given , although not exacted , for the powers of St. Thekla proved more than once of inestimable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the whole city ( mir . 9 ) was afflicted with a disease of the eyes , and no remedy // could be found , the saint appeared by night to some one in the church , and ordered all to use the water of her sacred fountain . This effectually cured the city . Another time all the animals of the town were seized with a mysterious disease . Thekla caused a fountain to spring forth near a little chapel sacred to her . By drinking this water the sick were cured . The sacred water again appears as a remedy in mir . 22 , when a horse is cured of paralysis by a draught . It is unquestionably a fact that incubation was practised at the shrine of St. Thekla . It was the custom of the martyr to appear by night to suppliants who had come to her church to sleep ( mir . 24 ) . Alypios , whose life was despaired of by doctors , had recourse to St. Thekla , and was saved in the following way : ? " The martyr appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick , in her own semblance , and asked from what disease he was suffering and what he wanted . " His answer in a verse of Homer ? " Thou knowest , and why should I tell one who knoweth ? " ? conciliated the saint and she smiled , delighted both with the man and the verse . Giving him a small pebble from her hand , she told him to fasten it on his neck as a charm against disease . Alypios clasped it in his hand , but when he awoke his hands were empty . Then he thought he had merely had a dream . But the fulfilment came , for his son entered , a short time after , with a pebble of exactly the same description , which he had picked up by the way . His father seized it in both hands , and was cured of the disease from which he had so long suffered . Several of the miracles make express mention of the fact that the vision appeared to the suppliant in sleep , // but there is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mir . 3 ) comes to the man when he is awakei7rap al ( ( 6 ' pap . A cure by touch is described once ( mir . 27 ) . It is a personal experience of the author . He was suffering from ear-ache , and thought he would be prevented from speaking at the saint 's festival which was approaching . But by night she appeared to him , took hold of his ear , and pulled it . Thus he was cured . The apparitions of St. Thekla seem more usually to have conveyed prescriptions of remedies . A woman ( mir . 2 ) was ordered to rub herself with dust taken from the holy shrine , and Aristarchos ( mir . 26 ) was told to anoint himself with the oil of the church-lamps . The sacred symbolism of the medicaments is evident . V. St. Michael The cult of St. Michael was one of the most widespread in Europe and Asia Minor . No com prehensive record of the archangel 's miracles exists , but attached to several of his chief churches are legends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his worship . At Constantinople there were churches of St. Michael from the fourth century A.D. The most cele brated of his shrines stood at the ancient Sosthenium , which came to be called Michaeliurn . Constantine the Great was advised in a dream to build it . The story of the apparition of St. Michael to Constantine is given by Nicephorus Callistus . ' The place got the name of Sosthenium from the Argonauts , who had been fight ing against Amycus , king of that district . They had suffered defeat , when a man with eagle 's wings appeared to them and prophesied victory . The pro phecy was fulfilled , and in gratitude they raised a shrine and statue at the spot in honour of the apparition . This was the shrine which Constantine visited . While he slept there , he had a vision of a man in the likeness of the statue , who declared himself St. Michael . When the Emperor awoke , he resolved to raise a church and altars to St. Michael , thus ousting the original pagan god . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The name was given to indicate a saviour god .
