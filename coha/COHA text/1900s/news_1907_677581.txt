txt Ex-RePretentative James W. Wadsworth to-day made open and irreconcilable his break with the President , which began a year ago over the fight in the House Committee on Agriculture for the Meat Inspection bill . Mr. Wadsworth came out in a careful interview , declaring his opinion that the President " is humburg and a fakir , " and that " the country is fast awakening to the real character of this bloody hero of Kettle HilL " Ever since the controversy over the Meat Inspection bill Mr. Wadsworth has been having hard sledding in his political travels . He was defeated for re-election in a memorable canvass. in which his successful opponent . Peter A. Porter . who was nominated as an Independent Republican and indorsed by the Democrats , used as his chief argument the stand taken by Wadsworth on the meat bill . Wadsworth 's friends in the House undertook to make things interesting for Porter by putting him down among the Democrats in the temporary roll of the next House . Porter raised a howl at . them . and the President came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all the Federal patronage of the district . Man after man who held his place by virtue of the friendship of Wadsworth has gone by the board to make room for an adherent of Porter . The climax came today when the " resignation " of Archie Sanders , Collector of Internal Revenue at Rochester , was announced . It was a resignation all right . but one that had been demanded by telegraph by Secretary Cortelyou on the order of the President . Sanders had made a good record for efficiency , and at a recent examination of his office had been passed with high marks . In the usual routine he had been directed by the Secretary of the Treasury to renew his bond for another four-year term . He had hardly got that done when the demand for his resignation fell on him . He was surprised and grieved , and he tried to secure a. hearing to find out what was the matter . But his request was refused . The fact was that Peter ' PirriTeedtti-lihd -- place , and the President determined to give It to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " President Roosevelt 's removal of Federal office holders in Western New York is such a flagrant violation of the precepts he has always laid down about his intention to retain efficient men in the public service that I am led to believe he was merely faking when he voiced those lofty principles , " declared Wadsworth . " This Sanders case is merely another instance of the purpose of the President to punish all my friends simply because I differed . and wisely differed , as time has proved , from him on certain recent issues . It is in line with the unprecedented action of the President in refusing to reappoint the Postmasters at Dansville , Attica and Lockport . The incumbents of those offices discharged their duties to the complete satisfaction of the Post Office Department and I was practically asked by the department to recommend them for reappointment . I did so , but the President held up the papers . As soon ss I was defeated for Congress the President selected new men for these offices  --  men recommended by my successor . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain in office - good officials . " The President practically turned down the recommendations of his advisers in the Post Office Department , who wanted the Postmasters reappointed because they had proved to be good officials , and at the same time he violated his own promises to the people . The whole thing stamps the President . as unreliable , a fakir , and a humbug . For years he has Indulged in lofty sentiments , and violates them all for the sake of gratifying petty spite . It is Apparent that he intends to persecute in a like manner every Federal officeholder who is so unfortunate as to be my friend . Thank God , he ca n't fool all the people all the time , ' and the country is fast awakening to the real character of this bloody hero of Kettle BilL " It is expected that to-morrow , when the President reads this , Mr. Wadsworth will be officially elected a member of the Conspirators ' Chorus .                  @ @ @
