In case of purchase the city is to pay not only for the tangible property , but for all franchise rights . including the " ninety-nine year " ones , that the company may have at the time . This is an abstract of the suggestions made to the council committee yesterday afternoon by John S. Miller ; representing the receivers of the Union Traction and its underlying companies ? regarding general terms on which he thought negotiations between the city and the companies could be carried on . Demand Pay for " 99 Year " Claims . Mr. Miller made it plain that the companies would not waive their " ninety-nine year " claims without compensation , declaring these are the main security for the $30,000,000 in outstanding bonds .

The representative said he thought a decision from the United States Supreme court on the " ninety-nine year " act could be secured within a year . As to the time required for the various interests In the Union Traction system to ratify an ordinance if one were drawn , lie said : " Five or six months , but tile committee would also have to consult first the council and then refer it to the people , so that is equal .

When Mr. Miller said that in a renewal of franchises one for the Chicago Passenger road should be Included , Mayor Harrison asked : " Why not take a new franchise for this company as compensation for the " ninety-nine year claims ?

" I believe the companies would be averse to this if the case were to be tried by a local jury , " returned Mr. Miller . " As to the ' ninety-nine year rights , ' if the courts decide none exist there will be none to pay for . All existing franchises of other kinds which expire before the ten years are up would be equally without value . " Asks Decade " to Improve Service .

The suggestion also contemplates that in the meantime , and until such purchase by the city shall be made ( or its right to make such purchase should expire , if limited in time ) . the companies should continue the maintenance and operation of their roads ? under such existing rights so far as they in fact exist and apply ; and so far as they do not exist or . apply , and- so far as any may expire in the meantime , such continued maintenance and ePemtkin is to be under indeterminate Ammo from the City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
