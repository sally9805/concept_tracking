txt If Fund Is Provided He Promises to Furnish a Sensation and Account for the Money . Police Commissioner Bingham sat in his office at Headquarters yesterday chewing away on the stem of his old corn-cob pipe . There was a gleam of satisfaction In his eyes . " I do n't care to give the location of i those places at this time . " said the Com- j missioner when THEI Tz.v.Es reporter asked him the site of the two " crime factories " within half a mile of the Waldorf , to which he referred in his after-dinner speech on Tuesday night . " They are there all right , . and I stand squarely by my assertion that there are a number of men in the Board of Aldermen who do not dare to give me the money to hire detectives to root them out . " " But , Commissioner , you say you know of them places and that policemen with whom you have talked also know of them ; why do n't you raid them ? " the reporter asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the reheon why I want money to hire special detectives . " " You mean that you have no evidence that would hold in court should you make arrests ? " asked the reporter . " Tharp just it . , Those places are so I strongly organized and so closely protected by some of the politicians connected with them , that none of my men can get inside of the doors to gather the necessary evidence . " " It has been suggested that your statement about these ' crime factories ' was I Simply bluff to cover uD the inactivity charged against the Police Department and an offset to the resolution introduced by Alderman Doull on Tuesday , " the CommisiOner was told . " If there is any man who has the money and wishes to call that bluff I think I can satisfy him , " was Gen. Bingham 's quick reply . " I 'll tell you what I 'll do , " he said . " Since the Aldermen have n't the nerve to give me the necessary money to ferret out crimes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen of New York that I know what I am talking about if he will be patriotic enough to put up the money to find out . " I do n't say *that I will arrest those people to-morrow or  --  the next day , or even next week or next month . But I 'll do this : If some reputable man will come to me with an offer of $10e,000 and say he wants to see the city cleaned up , I 'll convince him I can do it before a. dollar is spent , and then I will account to him for every dollar , day by day , as it Is spent . If you think that assertion I made about the crime factories was e. " sensation , it will be es a mild Spring zephyr to the disclosures I will make . " But I am not going to show my hand until it is called in the proper way . You have seen a chap in a poker game lay four of his cards down on the table in full view of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself . The other fellows are kept guessing , but it costs money to see that last card . Well , when I get the money you can bet it will prove to be the card that fills the flush . " 1 Commissioner Bingham said he was glad - to have got the speech he made at the pollee lieutenants ' dinner out of his system .
