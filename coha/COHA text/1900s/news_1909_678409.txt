txt The inhabitants of Washington never will forget the Inauguration of March 4 , 1909 . Neither will the visitors within its gates , the newspaper men on duty here , and the officers of the telegraph and telephone companies . Ninety-nine per cent of the wires are down . All trains are delayed from three to twelve hours- The union station tonight Is a scene of confusion . Military and other organizations and thousands who journeyed to the capital for the inauguration have thronged the waiting rooms and demanded with increasing impatience and hopelessness when they can get out of the city . Trains that should have brought their passengers into Washington in time for the inauguration were just getting in at 6 o'clock . When President Roosevelt and President Elect Taft . after spending the night in. the White house , met this morning in the breakfast room the first thing they did was to look through the window at the blizzard which raged outside . Even the Elements Protest . " Mr. President , " said Tart , " even the elements protest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew there would be a blizzard up to the very minute I went out of office . " ? But neither of the distinguished protagonists realized the full extent of the storm or the damage it had already wrought . One result of the abominable weather has been to give tremendous impetus to a movement for changing the date of the big show from March 4 to some time in April , preferably the middle of the month . It is recognized that the last two days ' inclemency have given Washington an exceedingly black eye . The governors of states and members of the senate and house of representatives who were interviewed on the subject this afternoon unanimously favored the change in date . Deaths from Exposure Expected . The strongest argument aqvancea was that many elderly citizens , some of them of national reputation , today have exposed themselves to such an extent that their serious illness and death may be apprehended .

" This is an indication of the quality of weather that may be expected In Washington on this date . ( It was snowing briskly at that moment . ) It will be necessary to amend the constitution to change the date and the sooner It Is done the bettor . Many of our most prominent citizens are exposed during the inaugurations and their death threatened . Business Men Also Agree . " The business men of the city . I am sure , will agree that it is a mistake to hold it during March , the worst month of the year . The inaugural ceremonies should be held about the middle of April , when the lilacs , famous flowers in Washington , are in bloom and the city is at Its best . " " I agree fully with what Mr. Hammond has said , " observed Gov. of Washiogton . " The people who come to Washington from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avail themselves of the educational opportunities of sightseeing , go away disappointed , and 1 do n't blame them .

Fort of KW Jersey , Gov. ? Hughes of New York , Gov . Pcnnewill of Delaware , in fact , every one w ho was asked about it , expressed themselves along similar lines . In fact , there was not a dissenting voice . Congressmen Favor Amendment . Speaker Cannon and numerous members of congress admitted that a constitutional amendment providing for the change ought to be submitted for adoption , whether It will be or not . A glance backward shows that the weather on inauguration day , if not actually inclement , has been mostly of raw and disagreeable character .

It should be an argument for a. change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made ? There have been blizzards heretofore and bad weather on inauguration days . Grant , Harrison , and Cleveland all suffered unfavorabsle weather conditions . But congress did nothing . Of course , I am in favor of making the change . SENATOR SCOTT ? I have always been in favor of changing the date . I do not see how any one can fall to realize after today 's experience the wisdom of such a course . SENATOR NELSON  --  The whole country can see today how necessary it is that a date for Inauguration be fixed when there is no likelihood of climatic hardship . SENATOR DILLINGHAM  --  Tho weather speaks for itself , and Is an argument in favor of changing the data of the inauguration . SENATOR LA FOLLETTE  --  yes , indeed ; this is an argument backing up those who have contended for a change . I certainly am in favor of it . Kansas Senator Wants Change . SENATOR CURTIS ?

I am In favor of the change . " REPRESENTATIVE JAMES A.TAWNEY ? " I amAn favor of a change in the inaugural date . I have not considered the subject at sufficient length to be able to determine just what it would mean , but I am confident that it would not mean any serious disturbance in the public business . As long as it would not I am heartily in favor 9f it . " REPRESENTATIVE J. ADAM BEDE ? I favor a change in the date of the Inaugural to any time more favorable than the 4th of March . I am confident that this reform will be brought to life before long by constitutional amendment or statutory act . REPRESENTATIVE HENRY C. LOUDENSLAGER  --  Ever since I have been in congress I have favored a change in the inaugural date .

I am opposed to any change . REPRESENTATIVE EDWIN D. CRUMPACKER  --  Yes , I am in favor of the change to the latter part of April . Senator Tillman said he was not worrying about the iveather . It 's the kind of a day to wind up this particular kind of an administration . Previous Efforts . to Change . A national committee was formed in 1901 , with District Commissioner H. it . F. at Its head , to make systematic efforts for a change in the inauguration date and a bill for the change was passed twice in the senate , but failed in the house . " I shall communicate at once with the governors of states and others on that committee . " said Mr. today . " Today 's weather certainly is a convincing argument for the change of the inauguration date to April , " he said . " We anticipate no real opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , today 's storm in severity could only be approached by that of thirty-two years ago , when the second inaugural of Gen. Grant took place and some of the cadets from West Point were frozen . The blizzard had Washington firmly in its grip when the 120,000 visitors estimated to be In the city opened their eyes this morning . It had been preceded the day before by a cold , driving rain and snow flurries , and belated ones at 1 and 2 o'clock this morning faced a wet and nasty snow that covered the streets with slush and saturated garments . The ground wee covered with the snow to a depth of four inches at daylight . It weighted down and snapped telegraph and telephone wires and trolley wires . It was impossible to get a telegraph wire out north at 8 o'clock . The telegraph wires in every other direction had given out soon after midnight , and finally the telephone companies announced they could handle no more long distance messages . As the day wore on the sky began to clear and the people became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , In part at least . Large forces of men were put to work cleaning the snow from the asphalt pavement in Pennsylvania avenue . Isolation Unrelieved Through Day . At noon the snow had ceased and the sun showed signs of appearing from behind the clouds , although no relief could be promised for Washington 's isolation from wire service . Fifty trains were reported late at the station during the forenoon , and the number incfeased until all schedules for outgoing trains were perforce abandoned . Several of the trains were more than twelve hours late . The sticky snow as blown in the faces of pedestrians with a velocity of twenty miles an hour and the early risers found it almost impossible to make their way about . Telegraph poles and trees weighted down with the snow , snapped and crashed under their burden . To add to the discomforts of the thousands of visitors and natives the street car service gave out and forced them to stagger along %%114 difficulty in the face of the blinding snow . Thousands Camp in Stations . Thousands of visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the ceremonies and found that they had to camp out in the railroad stations over night . Other thousands are stalled in neighboring towns and have had no chance of reaching Washington . ? Gov . Grottier/5 ' of Maryland was stopped at Annapolis . Part of his staff was left at Camden Station . The Seventh New York regiment which went from New York last night on special trains was stalled at Camden Station and was saved from extreme military hardships only by a well stocked commissary department . other New York delegations got as far as Baltimore in time to catch a Pennsylvania train which that company had managed to start out or Washington about ti o'clock and which carried the unfortunate New Yorkers back home . The great rush of excursionists *am not start from Washington until after 6 o'clock and then the railroads , already insufficient to the travel , clogged up " for keeps .

Besides ruining the pleasure of inc 2uo , too people who had come to Washington to take part In the inauguration , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Washington , which it will take months of the hardest work to make good . Along the tracks of the Balthhore and Ohio railroad from Washington to Baltimore . for instance , the Western Union Telegraph company has a double line of poles , one of which carries seventy wires . On one side of these tracks for a distance of thirty-five miles . between the Susquehanna river and Baltimore , more than 1,100 poles are down , carrying of course the wires . with them . On the other side between 500 and GOO poles have fallen . Most of the poles are snapped short off a foot or two from the ground and rendered entirely useless . A strange and so far unexplained feature Is the fact that instead of falling the same way both lines of poles fell inward over the tracks . thus entirely blocking traffic . Twe .... t.y-two Trains Are Blocked . As a result last night when the inaugural crowds , nothing ' from nearby cities were rushing to Washington at their densest no less than twenty-two trains between Baltimore and Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the capital city until the abbreviated Inaugural ceremonies were entirely over . Along the line of the Pennsylvania , between Philadelphia and Washington . were stretched the lines of the Postal Telegraph company , carried on about 5,000 poles . It is a sae assertion that more than half of these poles were thrown to the ground . The fact that all means of quick communication are thus destroyed makes impossible the of complete information as to the gathering extent of the damage done by the storm . It certainly will take months of work and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to get the telephone and telegraph systems south of Philadelphia along the Atlantic coast into .. , . rural working condition . Eighty-one Niles of Wire Down . An official statement by the Pennsylvania company shows that eighty-one miles of telegraph lines between Philadelphia and Washington were destroyed , and up to midnight telegraphic communication had been reestablished only as far as Perryville , Md . The- Baltimore and Ohio wires were open only as far as Aberdeen , Md . Throughout the day only three trains arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from six to twelve hours late . Six special trains which passed through Wednesday at midnight did not reach Washington until late today . The tleup on the Pennsylvania was equally as effective . The first train to arrive from Washington came in at 1:4S p. m. , exactly thirteen hours late . ? " The snowstorm we encountered after we left Washington , " said the engineer , " was the heaviest I ever saw . The flakes tell so thick and fast and in such whirling fashion that it was impossible to see more than twenty feet ahead of my engine . And the wind howled with a fierceness that was terrifying . We could hear the wires snap and break and the poles crashing to the ground . To us on the engine It w-as a night of horror , one which we wo n't forget . " Strange Kind of Storm . The blizzard which thus wrought havoc among all overhead wires and did comparatively little damage in other directions was a most peculiar one . All Wednesday afternoon it rained . Towards evening the rain turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the sleet came a great fall of soft and clinging snow , which caught on the sleet covered wires and weighted them down almost to the breaking point . With the snow came a strong wind from the west , which set the taut aims , already overweighted , to vibrating . Presently the strain became too great and pole after pole , measuring eighteen or twenty inches In diameter . was snapped off short at the base , falling in most instances across the track . From every city along the line of the storm swept district scores of repairmen were sent out and they were busy for hours in simply cutting away the wreckage so that the blockhd trains could move slowly onward . Railroad Men Run by Sight . With the trainmen It was a case of moving forward by sight alone , and one of the Pennsylvania crack trains , carrying the Sherman scouts from Utica , N.

Calls for Chicago were sent first to points In Virginia , then switched by devious routes to New Orleans , and from that point up the river .
