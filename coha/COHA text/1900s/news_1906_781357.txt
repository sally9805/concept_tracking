txt Upon the heels of an unsuccessful attempt upon the part of his mother to make Harry K. Thaw believe that the retention of Black , Olcott , Gruber &Bonynge; as chief counsel for the defense was to his interest , Clifford W. Hartridge , who is now Thaw 's personally selected lawyer , obtained an order from Justice Blanchard in the Supreme Court , yesterday afternoon , directing the rival firm to show cause to-morrow morning why the firm should not turn over to him all the papers pertaining to the case of his client . Mr. Hartrldge 's application is almost without precedent in the annals of the bar . It flies in the face of legal ethics , assuming a desire on the part of ex-Judge 01-cott 's firm to force itself into a case in which it is not wanted . That this is the impression sought to be created is shown by the fact that Mr. Hartridge 's application was accompanied by an affidavit signed by Thaw in which the accused murderer recites , in effect , that he dismissed the Olcott firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thaw 's affidavit goes on to say that Mr. Hartridge is his duly authorized attorney , . and that Mr. Hartrldge has informed him that Black . Olcott , Gruber &; Bonynge have papers in their possession which are of vital importance to his cause , with which lacy refuse to part . There is also an affidavit from Mr. Hartrldge , in which he reviews the circumstances of his retention , and quotes the letter written by him to ex-Judge Olcott asking that all papers in the Thaw case be transmitted to him . This affidavit sets forth that repeated demands have been made upon the firm in question , and that it has steadfastly refused to deliver the papers . A. Russell Peabody , Mr. Hartridge 's partner , was also a party to the petition . He corroborates the affidavit of his associate by , one of his own , asserting that in addition to written demands he made personal demands upon the Olcott firm for the papers and received only evasive answers . Thaw 's affidavit amounts , under the circumstances , to an open declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupies as Thaw 's choice for chief counsel . There can be no mistaking its wording . Reading between the lines it is not only a declaration of independence , but of Thaw 's intention to make , his fight in court as a sane man . In directing that the order be issued Justice Blanchard stipulated that service should be made before 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon . Ex-Judge Olcott was not in his office after the order was issued , but service was effected upon a representative of the firm . Mr. Olcott refused to discuss Mr. Hartridge 's latest move , with whom , by the way , he has had absolutely no communication since Thaw 's dismissal of ' , is firm . . a matter of fact , Mr. Hartridge , although he said on Sunday that ex-Judge Olcott had turned over some of the papers in the Thaw case to him , has received absolutely nothing of importance . It is understood that the Evelyn Nesbit Thaw statement sent to him is not the original , but a copy , and that the other documents received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inclined to discuss his attempt to establish himself as the head of the Thaw defense either . He talked with newspaper men after the filing of his application for fully an hour , but he made not the slightest reference to it . Indeed , it was not until the news was brought to his office from the court by a newspaper reporter , who broke in ' while the conference with the newspaper men was on , that he admitted having made such an application . Mr. Hartrldge 's Statement . " The application speaks for itself , " be said , when pressed for a statement . " I tried my best to get the papers/ I need for the preparation of Mr. Thaw 's defense by the usual methods . When these methods failed I was forced to have recourse to the courts . " There was not that cocksure attitude in the Hartridge camp yesterday which had marked it since Thaw wrote his letter of dismissal to ex-Judge Olcott . Mr. Hartridge is plainly disturbed by the position taken by Thaw 's mother , although he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him whether Thaw has money enough to pay him or not . Up to date he has been studiously ignored by the elder Mrs. Thaw , and John B. Gleason , the lawyer who , working with him , got the writ of prohibition against . the District Attorney restraining that official from taking further evidence in the matter of the killing of Stanford White , has met with no better fortune . Although he went down the Bay to meet Mrs. Thaw upon her return to this country , he failed to see her , and since she landed she has not sent for him . Mrs. Thaw 's effort to induce her son to re-employ the Olcott firm was not only earnest but intensely dramatic . She argued the point with tears in her eyes , and before she left him he was crying , too . That her attempt was futile , however . was shown when the Olcott writ , with Thaw 's affidavit attached , was brought to court . Thaw spent a restless night in the Tombs . The newspaper stories about the conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was best to stick to ex : , Judge Olcott , who favors the insanity theory , were eagerly read by him and plainly upset him . Mr. Hartridge was his first visitor . He was on hand as soon as the prison rules permitted . and , going immediately to the cell of his client , stayed in consultation with him for an hour . Evelyn Nesbit Thaw arrived promptly at 10:30 o'clock , but stayed only about ten minutes . It is said that Thaw bitterly reproached her for permitting the retention of the Olcott firm . As she was leaving the Tombs she was asked if she had anything to say , and for the first time in her dealings with those about the prison showed a. temper of her own . " I wish you would stop pestering me with questions , " she said . " If you want to find out anything go to Mr. Hartridge or Mr. Gleason . They are counsel for my husband and are authorized to speak for him . " She was driven in her electric hansom to Mr. Hartridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thaw 's mother , accompanied by her daughter , Mrs. George L. Carnegie , appeared . They drove up in an electric hansom and had a hard time getting through the crowd which had assembled in front of the prison . Mother anti Son 's Stormy Meeting . The interview between mother and son was a stormy one . Mrs. Thaw , who has been accustomed to obedience from harry , read the law to him in no uncertain tones , but the son refused to recede an inch from the stand he has taken in the matter of choosing his own lawyers . He told his mother that he did n't want ex-Judge Olcott in the case and that he did want Mr. Hartridge . He seemed to think that ought to settle it . Mrs. Thaw could not see it that way . After exhausting her powers of persuasion , she left the Tombs . The traces of tears in her eyes were plain . No instructtions were given to the chauffeur , but the hansom was driven to the office of Lewis Delafield , where it is understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraphs sonally escorted her to her son 's celL Her son and daughter went with her . She was even more intense in her pleading than she had been earlier in the day , but Thaw seemed immovable . Finally he sent down word that he wanted to see his wife if she came back , but that she must come up stairs unaccompanied . The younger Mrs. Thaw arrived soon after this message was delivered to the Warden . With her was Mr. Hartridge . The lawyer was told , politely but firmly , that he would have to stay in the reception room while his companion visited her husband . It was perhaps ten minutes later when a keeper called Hartridge to the consultation room on the second floor . He was ushered into this room and kept there until Mrs. William Thaw , Mrs. Carnegie , and Josiah C. Thaw left . It was evidently I a move to prevent a possible meeting . When the elder Mrs. Thaw and her two children were safely out of the way , he was permitted to go to his client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning in the arm of Evelyn Nesbit Thaw . This occasioned great comment inasmuch as it was their first public appearance together . The lawyer staid with Thaw all of two hours While he was at the cell door he was joined by his associate , Mr. Peabody , and it was then that the affidavits to ac-company his application for the writ di-rected against the Olcott firm was drawn . When he came down stairs he a as stopped by the reporters and asked some very pointed questions . " Did Harry Thaw send for you to tell you that you were no longer his personal counsel ? ' was the first query fired at him . " He did not , " was the reply . " Are you still his personal counsel ? " " I certainly am . " " Do you know that you will have to associate with Judge Olcott in the de . fence ? " " You will have to ask Judge Olcott . about that . " " Is it a fact that you told Harry Thaw : that if he faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in five min-utes ? " I do n't recall . I would rather not talk about that . " " Do you believe that if he did go on the stand and tell his story he would go free ? " " I will not discuss that question . " Last Sunday , when he issued his first statement after taking charge of the Thaw case , Mr. Hartridge said in the presence of a dozen newspaper reporters that no jury would ever convict Thaw of anything . When he was asked if he would be a party to an application for a commission to inquire into his client 's mental condition he evaded a direct answer by saying that he would do anything that was for Thaw 's best interests . John B. Gleason was at the Tombs when the elder Mrs. Thaw arrived . He did not meet her . He refused to say any'thing for publication , and the inference was that he had merely called to report progress in the matter of his writ of prohibition . When the argument on the application was called before Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor , . who was present on behalf of Mr. Jerome , said he wished to make some preliminary objections , and asked that the hearing be adjourned for a day . " If you want an adjournment why do you make any preliminary objections ? " " Because , " air . Taylor replied , " the writ granted by Justice Blanchard seeks to enjoin District Attorney Jerome , who is neither a court nor an inferior tribunal , and who , therefore , can not be restrained by a writ of prohibition . " In the second place , the writ seeks to enjoin the Grand Jury , which is also neither a court nor an inferior tribunal . The writ is not directed to the Court of  --  General Sessions . " In the third place , Thaw has an adeortuate remedy at law . The complaint states that the District Attorney is continuing an investigation in the Thaw matter . How can Thaw be hurt by any proceedings of the District Attorney ? He is now in the Tombs , under indictment . It may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who is mentioned in Mr. Gleason 's affidavit , would be entitled to a writ . " At this stage of the proceedings Mr. Gleason interrupted to say that Mr. Taylor was misinformed , inasmuch as the writ of prohibition was directed against . the Court of General Sessions . Mr. Taylor iadmitted his mistake . Mr. Gleason said he could not argue the preliminary objecstions without arguing the case on its merits and in detail . It was eventually agreed that the hearing should go over until this morning . Olcott Firm Wo n't Talk . At the , office of Black , Olcott , Gruber &; Bonynge absolute silence was observed in regard to the Thaw case . Neither exJudge Olcctt nor Terence J. McManus would either deny or affirm that the firm Riad been re-engaged . Nothing was needed from them . however , to confirm the story that they were again in the case . The detectives retained by them were hurrying in and out of the office for orders , and everything was moving along just as before Thaw 's letter of dismissal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference at the Hotel Lorraine on Tuesday night ex-Judge 01-cott and ex-Gov . Black talked matters over and concluded mat it would be perfectly proper for them to re-enter the Thaw defense . They are more firmly wedded to the insanity theory than ever , and as soon as District Attorney Jerome returns from the South they will make a move toward the appointment of a commission to examine into Thaw 's mental condition . The motion for the commission be made on behalf of Mrs. William Thaw and Josiah C. Thaw . If the firm succeeds in its expectations the case may never go to trial . Mrs. Thaw is firmly opposed to the publicity attendant upon a trial and believes that insanity is the only possible ground upon which her son may escape the penalty for his deed . She has undertaken the task of reconciling Harry to this view of the sitstation and will visit him at frequent intervals with this end in view . What Evelyn Nesbit Thaw thinks about the situation she refuses to say . It is known , despite the fact that she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison arm in arm . that their relations are purely formal and that the elder woman is inclined to blame her daughter-in-law for Harry 's troubles . In the event that a commission is applied for , the court before which the ap plication is made , will be the judge as to whether or not Thaw 's condition justfies an inquiry into his sanity . If he is found insane , he will be committed to Matteawan . If , however , the emotional sanity plea should be advanced , as The Olcott firm originally intended , Thaw would obtain his desire to face a jury . Should he be declared insane and committed to Diatteawan he would be liable to trial for the murder of White at apy time he should be adjudged to have recovered his reason .
