txt Frank Moss , head of the Society for the Prevention of Crime , and the police of the Mercer Street Station were at loggerheads for more than an hour yesterday afternoon , the controversy involving a discussion as to the definition of a poolroom . One of Mr. Moss 's agents , Robert S. McLellan , was assaulted in the rear rooms of the building at 724 Broadway , the front of which is occupied by Friedheim 's WaverlyCaf ? . Finding himself in the hands of six men the agent fired in the air , and help arrived in time to rescue him , half fainting . It was after this , when Mr. Moss pointed to a quantity of gambling paraphernalia and told some policemen that the place was a poolroom , that the discussion arose . " Two of my men  --  lVIeLellan and one other  --  were in the poolroom collecting evi-dence , " said Mr. Moss later . " No raid-was intended . Somebody recognized the two agents . Word was passed around that trouble was in store , whereupon , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter was pushed into the street . " McLellan found himself forced into a corner by six rnen , who inflicted on him several cuts and bruises . Seeing that he was in danger of his life ; le fired his pistol to attract attention . When he did this his assailants took fright and fled . " Meanwhile , a friend of mine happened to be passing on a street car . He saw the crowd that had been drawn to the spot by the report , and , upon hearing that some of my men were in trouble inside , ran to a telephone and called up my office , the Mercer Street Police Station , and the headquarters of the Society for the Prevention of Crime . " Before long several officers from the station ' and six of my men came up . Then I got there .

On the who ! e , it was one of the most elaborately fitted up places of the kind I ever saw . " Zio . Moss was emphatic in his criticisms of the police , saying that they tried persistently to balk his efforts to take away the paraphernalia . " After we saw what kind of a place it was , " he ... explained . " I said to Detective Sheehan , who appeared to be in charge of the officers from the station , ' ' What are you going to do ? ' He replied that he did n't know . I said , ' Here 's a poolroom ; do n't you see it ? " It looks like one , ' he answered . I asked if he was going to take the gambling apparatus to the station . and he said again that he did n't know . I insisted . Then he said . ' All right , we 'll take it in . ' " . Thereupon my men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two patrons as having been among those who assaulted , him , and these two were taken into custody . As the work of piling up the paraphernalia peoceeded. a patrol wagon , in charge of an officer and Ward Detective Wrenn. arrived on the scene . At first the men in the wagon declined to take the stuff to the station . I said to Wrenn : " ' Do n't you see that is gambling ap-paratus ? ' " ' I do n't know what to do . ' he replied . I said that my men were piling up the stuff at the order of Sheehan . When Wrenn heard that , he agreed that the wagon should take all the stuff over to the sta-tion . At the station I made a statement that was put down at my request in the blotter , to the effect that the place we had just entered was a bona fide poolroom and not a handbook place . When Capt . Thomas of the Mercer Street Police Station was asked about the affair , he said : " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a poolroom there . The two prisoners were charged simply with assault . No poolroom apparatus was found . " The station was also visited later for the purpose of looking - at the paraphernalia and seeing Mr. Moss 's statement on the blotter .

Not a word of such a thing . " Capt . Thomas said that Mr. Moss had wanted his men to break into the . place at 724 Broadway , , that they had refused because there as no warrant .
