 | III ? The Single-Handed Dinner Steady application to the work in hand resulted for me after the first two weeks in an intense desire to give up trying to perform housekeeping miracles . I had made a great many mistakes of the stupid kind , I had spoiled good food and I was tired , while the end to be attained still seemed a long way off . " Let 's not eat again , " I ventured , one afternoon as Mother and I were sitting on the piazza . Mother moved her sprained anlde gingerly , and then we looked at each other and laughed . That kitchen , with its everlasting sameness of fires and dishes and food cooked and uncooked , had ceased to appeal to my pride or my ambition since Mother 's accident . Things did n't move quite so smoothly as before , and I was not so sure as I had been of the charms of that home to which Ned and I were looking forward . The day that I sugared the soup and burned the chops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my memory , and the discouraging part of it was that I knew better . Just leaving things around brought the sugar in the place of the salt ; scribbling some rhymes that rang in my head burned up the chops , and neglecting to put the big pieces of bread crust in the water in which the onions were simmering made Father feel that he ought to eat in his shirt sleeves to preserve the unities of the domestic situation . With a grave face and amused eyes he penciled a few words in his notebook and handed me the torn leaf . " Henry Ward Beecher said that most people do everything three times : in anticipation , in reality , and in reminiscence . " And he left me to make my own application to the immediate question of boiled onions . All these things lingered in my memory as Mother . and I sat on the piazza after luncheon , and they were responsible for my despairing suggestion . " Let 's have sandwiches and milk for our supper , and telephone Father to get dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . " While I waited for Mother 's assent , the telephone rang and after I came back I simply dropped at her side and gasped out the news : " Father is bringing two men and Ned out to dinner . " " Go for Katie Ross , " said Mother , quickly , and I was off like a flash . Katie could n't come , but her brother 's wife would be afther helpin ' me , and when I returned it was with nothing more substantial than the hypothetical promise of the mythical relative . Clearly , " the need of a world of men for me , " and , having given the range a spiteful shake and donned the despised apron , I contemplated the prospect of getting a good and carefully prepared dinner , the first of its kind which I had ever attempted alone . " Think it out first , " warned Mother , " and write it down . Telephone for what you need ; do n't hurry and do n't fuss ; keep your head , my dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At 3 o'clock in the afternoon this is what we evolved : little neck clams , puree of peas , broiled chicken with potatoes , cucumbers and a simple egg salad , charlotte russe with maraschino cherries , toasted crackers and cheese and coffee . My pencil dropped and I looked at Mother in blank amaze . " It is n't very grand , " I said , slowly , " but it 's way beyond me . I 'm just about educated up to steak and mashed potatoes . If Katie Ross ' brother 's wife do n't be afther helpin ' me I see where Father and his fine friends go down to the Melden house . Oh , Mother , let me telephone for them to dine in town ; I never , never , never can in all this world . " " There are just as many panics in a kitchen as on a battle field , " laughed that determined and dominating Mother of mine , " and when you get over this one , let me know . " So she returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron and gave myself over to a successsion of hot and cold chills , after which I telephoned for clams to be sent opened , iced and ready to serve , for three broilers , cucumbers , lettuce and a pint of cream . Everything else seemed to be  | available , and Mother volunteered to make butterballs , and to cut the little round potatoes with the potato scoop , because those things would take time . Mother always worked evenly , steadily and without haste . It so happened that I had never seen anyone make butter balls . They just " were , " to my thinking and it was a revelation to see the nicety of work that went into their construction . A half pound of butter was cut into small cubes , and these Mother formed with her fingers into somewhat irregular round balls , dropping them into a pan of . ice water . In another pan of ice water stood the wooden spats , which had been carefully scalded , and when all the butter balls were thoroughly cooled it was the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spats , giving to each ball the regular , rounded , corrugated appearance which made them so attractive . Our butter always had a delicious flavor , because Mother liked to drop two or three big sweet clover heads in the butter jar , " to make it taste real . " After this she made the potato balls . I tried to help her but mine were disgraceful , all sizes and shapes . The little trick of pressing the scoop in very firmly took some practice for a novice . " Mashed potatoes and steak , " I sighed as the dainty white spheres fell rapidly into the bowl of cold water . " Is n't Father glad he married you ? " " Just about as glad as Ned will be when he marries you , " retorted Mother . " We 're going to board , " I said , with conviction . " I shall never in all this world be able to rise to the hights of a cook and a housekeeper . There 's so much to it , Mother ; you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeping . When you finish learning anything in this world it is because you yourself have given out , or given up , not because there is no more to learn . And if you are going to condemn Ned to a boarding house , it will be because you are less capable and more selfish than I thought . " " Please , ma'am , we wo n't board , but do n't look at me like that , I 'd rather pare potatoes . " To pay for her scornfulness , I gave Mother the mayonnaise to make . Her 's never curdled . One thing that bothered me in my experimental period was what a. cook of Mother 's called " cruddling . " " It 's my greatest trouble , ma'am , " this cook said , " everything cruddling . ' ' Moth- er 's mayonnaise did n't " cruddle " because she always used the yolk of a hard boiled egg , which she powdered with the dry ingredients first . This mixture she added to a well beaten yolk , and into the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved but tedious fashion of the cook books , but in a tiny , steady stream , beating constantly with a silver , fork , which she greatly preferred to an egg beater . At the point where it looked good and tasted horrid she put in the vinegar or lemon juice , and reduced it to the proper consistency , adding more oil if necessary and cream at the last . It is n't a way that anyone dares approve , because there is an orthodoxy of mayonnaise from which only heretics and good cooks dare dissent . I was so entirely occupied with giving Mother things to do that I was forgetting my own part , so I sliced the cucumbers to paper thinness and put them in cracked ice , because Father liked them crisp and not wilted . The peas were left-overs , and they were heated and pressed through a sieve , in readiness to be added to the slightly thickened milk with a bit of whipped cream , put in at the last minute . Mother nearly stepped on her sprained ankle when she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now do n't , " she ejaculated , " I 'd as soon eat Katie Ross ' brother 's wife 's cooking as that . Make a roux . " " A what ? " Verily , I had much to learn . " A roux . I mean , put a spoonful of butter in a saucepan , and when it is melted add the same quantity of flour . As it cooks , add the milk , and stir it constantly . That method cooks the flour more thoroughly than is done by a boiling liquid . Anything but these creams and sauces and soups that have that raw flour taste , and that buttery look . " " Well , " I said , " If I can remember I 'll try not to do any fourth-rate cooking for a first-rate Mother , but I 've got to make a sponge cake now for that charlotte russe , and what shall I do with these innocents ? I forgot about them , and I dragged forth the three chickens with their hopeless looking legs . " Those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit anxiously . " I do n't like to steam a broiled chicken , but when they are a little old it 's the only way . Give them about fifteen minutes in the steamer and then butter them and broil them slowly , covered with the split side down , until they are nearly done . Then you can brown the upper side without charring 1  | the skin . Put your boiler on something to raise it a little distance from the coal if your fire is hot . " " That fire is going to be just right , " I affirmed , sustained by the proud conviction that broilers and mayonnaise might be beyond me , but fires , there I was right at home . In the housekeeping years that have since come and gone , I have learned to value the sort of suggestions that Mother gave in her teaching . They were adapted to existing conditions . The cook books , with calm superiority , always take it for granted that the best of everything will be immediately available for culinary purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one recent cook book airily remarks " a gallon of cream , " woe be to the unfortunate who presumes to substitute anything of lesser grandeur . But many a time the housekeeper in moderate circumstances is confronted by the proposition how to make the best out of the second best , how to use every thing in such a way as to disguise humble origins , in fact , to make " skim milk masquerade as cream " without throwing off the mask at the critical moment . The housekeeper must be , at all hazards , an optimist , and an optimist , you remember , is said to be " one whose milk is always cream , " rather than a pessimist , " whose cream is always milk . " The man who gave those definitions had a good cook for a wife , no doubt about it . It was even so with those broilers . Depending upon an ordinary cook book , they would have been tough and uninviting , but as it was they defied the criticisms of the most exacting palate . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as there was no ground for doubting their extreme youth , their size became merely a matter for joyful congratulation . " I 'll put my sponge cake in now and get that out of the way , " I said , " and then I 'll put on the milk for the soup in the double boiler and put the potatoes on to boil , and boil the eggs for the salad . " " Good , " cried Mother , cheerfully . " You are beginning to cook now . You are really getting past the words-of-onesyllable stage , and are getting hold of the thing as a whole . When a cook begins to make sentences and use and ' in her work , I revive and have hopes of her . This dinner is going to be a great success . " Just as I was lifted to the seventh heaven by her approbation , and had caught up the kettle of boiling water for the eggs , I was dropped to earth by the quick warning , " Cold water for those salad eggs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then they will be even and firm and the yolks will be exactly in the middle . " " Words-of-one-syllable , " my tone was disgusted enough . " Is there anything straight ahead and the way you think it naturally would be in cooking ? I have n't found it yet . There 's always some unheard of , very-much-better way to do everything . Would n't you suppose boiling water would boil things ? " That emotion spent itself in egg-beating for the cake , and in twenty minutes the thin , soft , golden brown layer was cooling on the table , ready to be cut in strips for the charlotte russe . When I went in to arrange the dining table everything was " doing , " as the twins would say , and it was just thirty minutes before Father was due to appear . I glanced once more at my paper . The clams had come and were all ready to be put on the plates . The soup was ready to have the peas added . The chickens were steamed , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cucumbers were crisp , the lettuce had been washed and laid in a napkin on the ice and the eggs were sliced and ready , all but the first one , which I had blackened by using a steel knife ; the crackers were toasting , and it would n't take long to whip the cream , because Mother never used gelatine in her charlottes , just plain sweetened , whipped cream , flavored as she liked it . As I whisked the pretty centerpiece and best dainty china into place I gave myself a shock trying to remember about the hot and cold plates . " It 's all hot and cold , from the cook to the coffee , " so I comforted my soul , and as I said the word coffee it came over me that there was n't any coffee , because it had been forgotten . " Now , Mother , is n't it too hateful , " and the cook 's eyes began to brim over at the prospect of the failure of such a nice dinner . " Father 's dinner is spoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't , because there is n't any , " but even as I said it I had a hopeful feeling that Mother would conjure coffee out of something . " Did n't you put a covered pitcher of cold coffee in the refrigerator this morning ? " she asked , slowly . " Yes , but that 's no good , I just saved it to drink in ease the household catastrophes gave me three or four attacks  | of nervous prostration before luncheon . " " Did you pour it off the grounds before it had stood too long ? " " Right after breakfast , and I covered it and put it on the ice the way you said . " " Then it will be all right to heat it and serve it , because our coffee is always strong . I 'd rather have it fresh , of course , but this makes an excellent substitute if you ca n't help yourself . " " I knew you could do it , Mother , " ( oh , the relief I felt ! ) " now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like this dinner they can get another girl . " Thus exulted the cook . The chickens were beginning to sizzle , the whipped cream stood in its little covered churn by the ice , the sponge cake , cut in pretty strips , lined the individual glasses standing on the dainty doilies on the very best dessert plates , and there was just time to scramble the doors shut before Father 's laugh was heard in the hall . Then I had another panic and wanted nothing so much as to run and hide . That being impossible , I gave a last look at the flowers , lighted the candles , and attended to the hundred and one last things , each of which ought to be the very last , and ca n't , with one pair of hands to do the work . Olives , nuts , water , ice , candies , all the impossible and unnecessary and very important little forks and spoons , my brain whirled , and at that moment one candle shade burned up and covered the tablecloth with black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the damage was soon repaired , but it was n't calculated to lessen the panic of the mind . But by the time the cold and peaceful clams were served the sight of the pretty table and the sound of laughter and talk had cheered my spirits and my demure white apron covered a heart whose beating was somewhere near normal again . The soup was at the point of perfection when it was served , and I had kept mother glued to her chair in the kitchen . Not for gold dollars would I have let her sit at that table with the others , for all father 's vehement protests when he first came in . She was the success of the occasion , I assured him , and he could tell those unsuspecting men that she had a sprained ankle . How fast they all ate soup ! It was positively indecent haste . But Mother warned again , " Do n't hurry , everything is all right and they are having a fine time . No one is in misery but you . That chicken is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parsley Mother had been preparing . Some went on the chicken , some went in the melted butter that was lightly poured over the potatoes , and the rest , I regret to say , went on the floor . But everything did look very nice , and my hungry mouth watered as I politely passed and passed and passed things which were growing beautifully less . But by the time a few odd legs and wings had returned to the kitchen , and Mother was rejoicing in the smoothness of the mayonnaise , of which she secured about a saltspoonful , the cook was herself again , and felt serene and confident as she added the red cherries to the white cream , and passed the unimpeachable coffee . I never expect again to go through such a gamut of emotions , hope and despair , joy and sorrow , confidence and distrust , pride and humiliation . A first night at a great play does n't stir the feminine soul to its depths any more than the first preparation of a really good meal . Do n't underrate cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush in and give yourself body and soul to the accomplishment of something which looks so simple that you expect the first ignorant Swede or Pole whom you engage to do it with perfect ease . After it was all over Father slipped out to the kitchen , " My girl , I was proud of you . I felt sure you could be depended upon . " Never again will anything sound quite so sweet as that did , unless it was Mother 's , " You can if you want to , my dear . " As for Ned , when Katie Ross ' brother 's wife did appear in time to wash the dishes , he disappeared with the cook , and Mother 's laughing voice followed us down the path , " How do you feel now about boarding ? " " Young Man About to be Married , " adjured Ned , solemnly , " pick out your wife 's Mother before you choose your wife . " COOK CAULIFLOWER in milk and water , a little more than half water . The vegetable will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when cooked in water alone . Cauliflower thus cooked , and dressed with drawn butter , pepper , salt and a dash of lemon juice makes a very palatable dish . Cooked in milk and water and then placed on the ice to chill cauliflower works up into a very nice salad simply served with a leaf or two of crisp lettuce and dressed with oil , lemon juice , pepper and salt . Pepys .
