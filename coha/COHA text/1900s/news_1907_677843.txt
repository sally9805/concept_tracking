txt Immediate and approving response has been received from all over the country to the action of the President and Secretary Cortelyou in announcing the sale of $50,000,000 of Panama Canal bonds and the Issue Of $100,000,000 of treasury notes as a means of restoring public confidence and putting an end to the money stringency . Many communications were received at the White House and the Treasury Department to-day from business men , financiers , and members of Congress , indorsing what had been done and declaring it would have the desired effect . These communications were made personally , and came by telephone and telegraph . Some small undercurrent of criticism was manifest , but in general the response wag of enthusiastic approval . From New York came the announcement that a syndicate of banks had been formed to take 525.000,000 of the Treasury notes . The full measure of the relief afforded , especially to the banks , was not cOmpreheaded last night when the official statements and the letters of the President were made public . But it came out this afternoon , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebtedness would be accepted by the Secretary as security for additional bank circulation . ? - ? These certificates willbe issued in both registered and coupon form . The registered certificates will be in effect , therefore , simply short-term bonds , and as such acceptable under the law as a basis for circulation . In his circular offering the certificates for general subscription Secretary Cortelyou announced that ** of them I would be reserved for allotment in his personal discretion . These are the notes from the sale of which ? it is hoped especially to attract back into circulation cash that has been withdrawn from the ' banks recently and bidden away where it would do nobody any good . The other $30,000,000 of Treasury certificates will probably be sold to banks under an arrangement similar to that for the sale of the Panama bonds , so that they will become immediately available as circulation security . This means the opportunity to I the National banks to take out $100.000.000 of additional circulation if that proves desirable , instead of only the $50,000,000 , which would have - Been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There has been discussion to-day as to whether the certificates could also be employed as bank reserves . If that were permissible , such use would serve to release immediately a great amount of cash which the banks are now obliged to hold as re ' serves . It was Intimated at the Treasury this afternoon that the question was under consideration , but officials would not discuss it or indicate whether they thought it likely that this use of the ear1 tificates would be permitted . I Both President Roosevelt and Secretary Cortelyou were much gratified by the character of the messages received to ' day , and especially by the fact that so many of them came from the West and South . It was in these sections that the greatest strain had been felt . The messages indicate an intention on the part of banks and individuals there to avail themselves of the opportunity offered as soon as possible . The President was informed that his letter expressing confidence in the fiscal soundness of the country had been printed in several languages in Buffalo and distributed among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the effect of checking the run . On Sale at Once . The sale of the Treasury certificates can begin at once . It will take some time yet to prepare them , but Secretary Cortelyou already has had printed receipts which will be given to subscribers , and which will entitle them to the certificates whenever they are ready for issue . The design for the new certificates has been agreed upon , and Director Sullivan of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ' has been instructed to proceed with the ' work . The certificate will be of the same dimensions as other currency and in appearance will closely resemble a $30 silver certificate . On the left side of the face will be a vignette of Alexander Hamilton and on the top of the back in large letters will appear the words " Certificate of Indebtedness . " The date of the act authorizing their issue will be given together with the date of interest and the date of retirement , one year hence . The Panama Canal bonds have been printed and will be ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , 1007 . No information was forthcoming from the White House to-day on the subject of the currency measure which the President foreshadowed in his letter to Secretary Cortelyou last night . None of the menihers of the Senate Committee on Finance has been in Washington recently , but IChairman Fowler of the House Committee on Banking and Currency was here a ifew days ago , and had a conference with the President . The plan which has been under advisement would provide for the . issuance of about $250,000,600 , of Beset currency , - with a , graded tax which weithi tend tO ' ? force it , out of circulaiion. as soon b.s the emergency which called it forth had passed . Attention was called to-day to the fact that the measures adopted by the Government now will supply an amount of currency equal to if not greater than that available under the elasticity provisions Of the English or French system . The limit in England , it was pointed out , is only about $110,000,000 , and that In France I approximately the same . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the determination to adopt these measures that the actual need for cash did not call for such liberal provision as it was proposed to make . lent the President and 1 is advisers felt that if any such move was to be made itfwould be wise to make the relief , furnished so ample- that there could be ? no question of its succeeding . The idea was to have the Government afford the means of throwing an enormous amount of currency into the channels of business ? and then call on the people who have been hoarding their cash to follow the lead of the Government . It was felt that such an example of confidence on the part of the Administration could not fail to meet With a hearty response from all parts of the country . Senators and Representatives who have discussed the matter with the President and Secretary Cortelyou to-day are emphatic in their belief that the plan will ' be entirely successful . It was estimated by some of them that the sale of the Treasury certificates would result in call ' ing cash from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that which comes from the banks will not ? be long withdrawn , as Secretary Cortelrou announces that the deposit of the proceeds of such sales will be practically simultaneous with the purchase of certificates . And , besides this , there will be the same amount of new circulation which will promptly follow the taking of certificates by the banks . All the cash that comes out of hiding to buy certificates V-111 be a clear gain . The financial conferences which have bean going on at the White House for the last few days have relegated politics temporarily to the background . The questions of currency reform and financial legislation will result in extending the President 's message beyond the scope intended before this situation arose . It : nay be stated , however , that they have not resulted in any material alteration of either parts of the message . There have been no developments of a character to change the President 's mind on the sub:eats which he had already covered , and the attitude declared in his speeches at Provincetown and Nashville will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks from to-day , but the inessage will not be sent in until the next da The Senate will adjourn almost immediately after meeting , out of respect for e memory of Senators Morgan and Pettus of Alabama , both of whom died since  --  the adjournment of Congress last March . The House will take only the time neces ; earsto elect the Speaker , perfect its orwanize.tion , and draw seats , when it , too , ' will adjourn out of respect to the memory of members who died last Summer . The pilassage has been completed and has gone to the printer , so that any further Changes there may be will probably be only of a minor character .
